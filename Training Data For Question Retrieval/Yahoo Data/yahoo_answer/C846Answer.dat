83vhCGW1aa	Personally, I think that the real estate market is pretty much bottomed out at the moment.  My guess is it stays about flat for maybe six months from now the prices start climbing out of the hole.  If I had the money I'd be buying now, but I am fresh out of law school so all I have is student loans to pay off.

Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    Your sons income is below the filing threshold for a dependent.  He does not have to file.  You could file a return for him to get back his $10.    Also, you need to look at the bottom of the W-2, in the state tax information section.  Was there any withholding for any state?  If there was you will probably want to file a return for that state as well to get that money back also.    Otherwise, nothing to worry about.    Hope this helps.

9tGy76hpaa	First of all, figure out what you like and dislike. A lot of people change careers because they dislike their job, their boss, their company. What do you really like doing when you're at work, when you're at home - in your spare time.    Once you've discovered (or rediscovered) your passion, spend some time researching the types of careers that center around your passions.     Leverage some of your current skills and experiences to your new career. There are many skills that are transferable and applicable to what you want to do in your new career.    You may find it necessary to update your skills and broaden your knowledge. Take a course or two to ensure you really like the subject matter. If you are going for a new degree or certification, make sure you check the accreditation of the school, and get some information about placement successes.    One of the real keys to successfully changing careers will be your networking abilities. People in your network may be able to give you job leads, offer you advice and information about a particular company or industry, and introduce you to others so that you can expand your network.    You'll need to be flexible about nearly everything - from your employment status to relocation and salary. Set positive goals for yourself, but expect setbacks and change - and don't let these things get you down.|`|Wch2WybQaa	Travel Agent?
ZeDjn4cVaa	If box 5 on the 1099-A is marked yes (personally liable), then you treat that you sold the property for $288,900.  You also have potential cancellation of debt income of $23,069 (=$311,969 - $288,900).  You need to work through form 982 and its instruction to see if any of the exclusions of cancellation of debt income apply to you.  If they do then you fill out form 982 to claim the exclusion.  Any cancellation of debt income that cannot be excluded is taxable income to you and reported on form 1040 line 21 (If personal home), schedule C (if business property), schedule E (if rental property.    If box 5 is marked no, then you treat that you sold the property for $311,969 and you have no potential cancellation of debt income.  You calculate your gain/loss on sale of the property and report it as appropriate (personal property on schedule D, depreciable business or rental property on form 4797).  If the property is your primary residence you may qualify for the exemption of any gain on sale, but no tax loss is allowed for personal property.    The 982 form is complicated and you might want to have any calculations you do checked by a tax professional to ensure they are correct.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice is based upon my understanding of the tax law at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.

0yqQg9CXaa	You are destroying your credit slowly.  It is 100% myth that carrying balances increases your score.  Something old ladies will tell you.    Whatever you do, never go over 30% of your available credit limit at any time.    If you reach 70% of your available credit you will find that cards will jack up your interest rates and lower your available credit.    You can achieve 800+ scores by simply paying your credit cards in full each month.  I am proof.  No need to EVER pay interest.    google fico score calculator and input your numbers.  use credit cards - don't let them use you  /|`|BlVudiyfaa	You have no fiscal discipline|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Well, that depends on alot of things.  First, in regards to that particular card, if you are making all of the payments on time, that is good.  But you need to keep your balance at or below 60% of the credit limit.  Otherwise this will hurt your credit score.  It will say "proportion of balance to limit is too high".    But there are other things to consider.  First, do you pay all of your other bills on time, do you have any collection accounts, civil judgements, tax liens, or unpaid child support?  These will all hurt your credit.  Also, having your credit pulled often is not good.
Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    If you, or your mother, are paying tuition and fees to attend college, your mother may be able to claim education credits on her tax return provided you do not have grants or scholarships that cover the cost of tuition and fees.

You lose this 3500 dollars because she takes you as a dependent. You taxable income would otherwise be 50 dollars and your rebate would be 396 dollars. As is , you taxable income is 3550, you owe 358 in taxes and only get back 42 dollars as a return. You r loss in this situation is 354 dollars to you.    Your mother, on the other hand is lowering her taxable income which she is probably taxed at a higher tax rate and probably saving more than 354 dollars.    There are many ways she could save more money  but you did not list enough information to give you specifics and tax advice is the same as legal advice, if you post yourself as an expert you can be sued if it costs the other person.

I hate people that make up answers and have no idea what they are talking about. I too am a disabled vet. Good luck.    If the government didn't provide you with this information, there would be no place on your 1040 to enter it. I receive mine every year, but have not rec'd it yet this year.

But on second thought I think that you should try something more conventional.     You need to find something that will get you out of the house and out into the real world. It'll be difficult at first, I know you're shy and have good reason to be, but it will get easier. Look in the local paper for employment or even something part-time.    What skills do you have?

The cost of your taxes truly depends on the amount of work that the provider must do in order to complete them.

As far as HnR Block goes - they are probably one of the most expensive out there and the people they bring in aren't true professionals.  They are everyday people such as yourself that took the HnR Block tax prep course.  I really wouldn't recommened them.

OE29FfCvaa	You will need to ask for a corrected 1099 (best if you do it in writing so that you have documentation to that effect).     The banks usually do not keep track of cashed checks unless they were deposited to your father's account, and then cashed from that account. If that is the case, then you have your record to prove to your employer.     Also, non-employee compensation is subject to self-employment taxes and usually is reported on a schedule C of your form 1040.  If you take a look at that schedule, you will see that there are allowable expenses that you can take off the income amount.      Call IRS at 800-829-1040 for any other questions you may have regarding this issue.
K7x1RHVFaa	It does not matter, much.    0 gets yout money back at the end of the year in a rebate.    1 gets you the money during the year in the form of a slightly bigger paycheck.    And, if you can be taken as a dependent on your parents taxes your rebate is going to go to them anyway as you lose your exemption at that point.     The only thing is that your first 8025 is taxed at 10% and the rest is taxed at 15%. The way you explain it both jobs will only make 9000 so 16050 will be taxed at 10% and 1950 will be taxed at 15%, (1897.50) when the tax chart assumes 9975 dollars was taked at 15%,(2298.75). In other words you will likely owe on your taxes come filing time, but; you will have kept or spent that money all year long, (401.25 difference).    It is up to you but the answer is it make little difference. You can pay them now and they pay you later, or you can wait and see how much if any you owe.    So long as 90% of your taxes are paid by year end you are fine.    Good Luck.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If you file 0, you will have more taxes taken out of your paycheck. And, you will get more back at tax time. If you file 1, you will have less taxes taken out of your paycheck. But, it's possible that you may not have enough to pay your taxes and you may owe money at tax time.     So, I would recommend 0. Getting a surprise that you have to pay taxes instead of getting money back can be devastating if it's a significant amount. And, it's always a nice little bonus to get cash back from the government in April.|`|AA10719605	I would do 0.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	If you are working part time jobs you should claim 0.  They don't usually withhold much tax anyway on a lower income job.  This way they would withhold more than claiming 1. What happens if you have a few part-time jobs then hardly any tax is withheld then you could end up owing at tax time when all your income is added together.

98yRLXfhaa	Ok. Same thing happend last week with alot of people. It could be an IRS mistake or glitch. I would expect it by friday. The funds are supposed to be released tomorrow night to the bank. However, since you went through turbo tax...go to www.sbbt.com and click the RAL/RAC link on that page. Your funds go through sbbt bank before they get sent to your regular bank because thats what turbo tax uses. SBBT can tell you if any funds have been recieved yet. Good Luck and have fun spending that money!    Sorry...my mistake.|`|pjEYIvFdaa	Going through turbo tax does not mean your refund goes directly to SBBT. That is only true if decided to have your fees taken out of your refund.    You need to call the bank and if they cannot find it call the IRS and ask for a trace.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Depends on when your bank posts the transfer.  Some do it at 3 pm  Others not till midnight
764b0a2542a042d446e82dc85deb410faa	Well put is this way... If a women ran for presidnet all the women would vote for her even if they did not like her. Just to get a chance at getting a women in office.    I hope women will not be running the buisness world in the futures. I worked for this company. The VP was a blond size two, and did you know her **** did not stink. ( so she thought) She was such a ***** that I wanted to strangel her. I had a few round with her. I was in management and I did not like her attitude. THen the other manager in the office was so mean that she had people crying everyday. People walked out and quit because this women was so mean. Finally enough was enough and complaints were filled. So they sent her to a special training to deal with her anger and bitterness and bitchiness at work. She was good at her job but when it came to dealing with people she sucked. We lost how many employees in our communication company because she was down right nasty and made them cry. There was not a day that went by that someone did not come knocking on my office door in tears needing to talk. The company did  everything they could to change her bad attitude to a good one.  She tried to take away breaks so we would show more production then the other offices. we were in communications.  we were given an hour a week to hold a group meeting to discuss things. she would hold these during peoples breaks. so it made her look more productive.  This women had gone off on me more then once and I let her have it.  Guess who she turned to when she got fired? Me. She called me at work and asked if she could meet me at her house.  I felt bad but we all could see it coming.  I told her to enjoy her time off and lay on the beaches near her home in florida and get a tan. I was given a choice by the lady vp between my job and my daughter. And me taking on the job of being her girl scout leader in kindergarden interfierd with my job. I had no time I was told to attend girl scout meetings and other events at my daughters school. Then one day my daughter was sick and I was on a conference call with the vp and the school could not get through. So they called the main line. And someone knocked on my door and said I had an important call and the vp said it can wait. the lady said no her daughter is very sick. i said i would be back in five minutes. I went and asked my assistant to go to school and pick up my daughter and I gave her money and said go get yourselves something to eat and see if she feels better. So I came back to the conference call and said it is taken care of. Someone else is picking her up. Later on I told her to bring her to work. She hung out in my office and was feeling better. Funny thing once the vp had her baby. she had her baby at work with her everyday. i was working from 8 in the morning till sometimes ten or ll at night. I never saw my daughter. So when the company downsized and moved the office I was in to another city I declined to move and compute everyday. Back and fourth one hour there and one hour back and same long hours.  I was given a huge severene package and unemployment.  So the point is, I am now my own boss and work from my home and on my time. Never again will I work for a women in the buisness world.I do not know if they feel they need to prove to men that they are strong or what. But women and the buisness world does not work. Especially in upper management or vp.  I hope women will not be running the buisness world. Or this world will go to hell. There will be no one who will work for these companies if women start controling and running the buisness world. and hey this is coming from a women. Woment let it go to their head that they are in command and treat people like ****. When I was a manager with my own office and phone line I treated people with respect, and I can honestly say I was the only women in the whole company out of all the offices that treated everyone with respect. My employees voted me employee of the office each year.  So we have to keep these women out of upper management jobs in the buisness world.  Unless it is Hillary Clinton in the white house. How would bill fell about being on the other side of the desk. sorry this is so long..........but women and buisness executiven vp and upper mangement does not go well with ladies.

Of course, that is what he says in his pitches and, since he has a good reputation, there is no reason to disbelieve him.  Perhaps, though, before you plunk down a thousand dollars to get his stock option tips, you should play with options yourself, on paper (i.e., computer...).  There are many sites that have paper trading accounts for you to learn by.  http://www.optionsXpress.com is one of them.  Options are a lot less risky than people think, when you are thinking long-term trends.  When you see stocks starting to move downward, they most often stay moving downward until something prompts them to stop.  Many, many stocks are coming due for some put options (the price is going to fall significantly...) that expire in September, October, November and January- namely Apple Computer (AAPL) and General Motors (GM).  Go to your favorite site and look up the option chains for these stocks on the Put side, then watch as the value of those puts increase.  See?  Now you're paper trading!  Best of luck to you!

There are three ways to be when playing options...out-of-the-money, at-the-money, or in-the-money.  Out of the money means that your option, if it expired now, would be worthless.  If you're holding it for the longer term, it can still move and make you some money, provided you bought on the correct side of a Call vs. a Put.  At the money means that the time you have remaining on the option and the price of the underlying security are at equilibrium and if it expired today, it, too, would expire worthless.  If you are holding it for the longer term, you have a better chance of making money if you buy at the money then you do if you buy out of the money and hope the price moves for you.  The other way you can be holding an option is called in the money.  Your option, if it expired today, is still viable and worth something to someone who holds the underlying security.  If you hold it and someone can use it, that makes it quite valuable.    Options are a fun way to understand the markets in a different way.  Go to the Chicago Board of Options Exchanges, where you can sign up for free and get all kinds of great stuff to learn about trading options.  There are online courses that are free and even advanced courses, taught by a real person online, that are very reasonably priced.  Be sure to go to the Education Section and download the Options Toolbox.  It is a great tool for you because, not only does it explain options and what they are, but it also has an Options Calculator that allows you to see how they work.  That way, you can get a good sense of the power of buying options, which can be enormous, indeed.  Best of luck to you!|`|AA10643841	u asked that q 2 times|`|AA12288819	2 points in the money can mean a couple of things. In terms of stocks it could mean that your stock has gone up enough to cover the commission and fees that were paid when you bought the stock. (ie. you are now making mone on your stock)    The other way that I have heard that term used is in stock options. Stock options have something called a strike price. That is the dollar figure that the option is based upon. For example if you own a Dell July 25 Call option that would mean that would mean that if Dell computer reaches 25 by the expiration date in July you have the right to exercise your option and purchase 100 shares of Dell  at $25 per share even if the stock is selling  on the open market at a higher price. If Dell does not reach $25 by that July expiration date the option will expire worthless. So for a final example if Dell computer is trading at $27 dollars and you own those July 25 call options your option would be 2 points in the money.   I hope that helps.
098422247b3fa97379e4db23688ae225aa	Well, the biggest difference between an RN and a PA is that a PA is allowed to dispense medical advice and write prescriptions whereas an RN takes care of the preliminary exam for the doctor (vitals, symptoms, paperwork, etc). RN training takes less time, but PA training gives you more actual medical training.|`|b3612df545f8ff194b9242ddb6d3785faa	The whole concept of you thinking that a RN, BSN, or PA is so easy to accomplish is ignorant at the very least.  Obviously you have no idea about the commitment it takes, nor the knowledge that you are required to have.  I am sure you are one of those people that when they see the fire department and ambulances show up that you refer to the medics and emts as "ambulance drivers".  I will have you know a paramedic license is a 2 year program as well.  A biology degree does nothing for you other than help you with the A&P portions of the programs, as for pharmacology, pharmakenetics, and just general medical knowledge disecting a pig or frog doesn't even come close to preparing you for what you think is such a simple field to get into.  I would love to know your name so that I can make sure that I never pick you as a doctor, if for some strange cosmic screw-up you actually get accepted to medical school, or even stranger yet actually graduate and pass the boards...... or were you talking about being a chiropractor when you said you wanted to be a doctor?

It is a shame that you think you are so smart that you can just do anything you want at any time.  You probably grew up rich, too.  My advice to you is to get a grip on reality and plant your feet on the ground for once.  Look around you and see what other people really do.  Nursing school is two years, period.  There are clinical courses as well as didactic courses that require time and understanding.  Your being in a hurry to do it tells me you are arrogant enough to think you can take a correspondence course and be a nurse in six months!  Ha!  As far as being a Physician Assistant, that too takes quite some time- about three years.  The course requirements are very stringent and the field is very competitive.  Unfortunately for you, entry into the program is not dependent on how smart you think you are, how much money you daddy makes or how naive and arrogant you are, either.  They look for well-rounded individuals who actually care about other people, who won't use their profession as a stepping-stone.  I suggest you take these words to heart.  When you don't make it and you do not get into medical school, I believe that you can retrace the reason to the fact that you are an obxnoxious young man.  There is still time to change and learn to appreciate other people in the world besides yourself.  I doubt you can do it, though.  Best of luck to you!|`|AA12060399	phys asst is best, but you may as well go for md|`|AA11258358	I believe that nursing would be the fastest thing for you to complete.  Then if you wanted to go on to be a PA, your nursing classes may transfer and perhaps you won't have to take as many for your PA.  I know that PA school is like medical school crammed into a hardcore curriculum.  Anyway, getting your nursing degree will be fastest.  There are some programs that can get you done quick, but getting an RN in six months might be challenging.  Good luck.

Do you really believe that an executive sitting in a busy office wants to see your invention, whether patented or not?  Of course not.  There are rules about that anyway.  Nothing beats legwork.  Take your invention and a portable laptop to the offices and wait for a meeting.  You may have to cool your heels for days in order to get three minutes with the guy.  But you will get your three minutes with him, if for no other reason than to get rid of you.  In your three minutes, relax, speak clearly and directly to the point.  Don't use the word, "I."  Use the word, "You."  You can benefit from this by...  Your company...  Next thing you know, you'll be the new Moog or Les Paul!  Just get up off your *** and go sell it!

AA12277184	i worked once for distributor that represented a small company that obtained u.s. rights to a soil microorganism that was discovered in england and was researched by  university of idaho and found significant agricultural applications to ward of soil diseases by becoming part of the plants root system. this was 11 years ago. a large chemical company and a large contributor to the university forced them to sell rights to the microorganism to their corporation west of texas, therefore giving them California. meaning they had the most environmentally progressive and largest market. they shelved the product. underfunded we struggled on for two years. the owner had to regretfully let us go. he is still hanging on to this day. the product is safe, i got testing started by organic farmers, nurseries, other universities, county agents, even a prison system but with little money it was to little or no avail and the product still not widely known. that is how it works.|`|3c99d83fcc36188ae968d825cb61b0e7aa	You want to research "niche marketing" and "positioning"    Good authors are Ries and Trout, Seth Godin, Dan Kennedy.

The difference between this 2 kind of costs are that the fix cost are not related to the employees (so they normally are not change if there are any personal variation)  Fix costs are:  Pay back of investments   Electricity, water, gas, waste management, current taxes, rental fees, etc, services, Internet, phone costs, radio, licenses, etc etc.  Variable costs are directly related to the production: salaries (including extra working time)  exploitation costs (transport costs, production costs, stock costs, etc) because they can be managed essayer and normally they are related to the production activities.   (cost/hour of work, cost/km, cost/tone, cost/sqm etc)   So it is not usefully to make a average cost/employes including all costs, because that will be only a statistic figure widhout scientific relevance.   You can make a production cost/unit, when you produce things (so in order to produce something valued at 12 USD you spend 7)or a sales cost/unit when you sale something (so in order to sell something at 100% value you spend 15% from the final value with logistic, stocks, marketing, distribution, service and warranties)|`|86ad75ea245e333138631d95b3780455aa	7.5% of total salary

c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	The problems in the Far and Middle East really have little to do with Dollar valuation in real terms.  The USD is in a secular decline because of problems the country has at home: i.e., massive internal and external debt with rising interest rates, systemic inflation and relatively stagnant real job growth (when calculated subtracting the up-tick in housing-related employment...).  Ironically, as it relates to vis-a-vis other major currencies, you should see the Dollar hold its ground a little firmer.  In times of crisis, the world still looks to the USD as a safe investment.  In other words, as long as there is strife and conflict breaking out all over, the Dollar will be buoyed.  The shift into other currencies as a safe-haven investment will be delayed because everyone knows that the US is still the strongest economy on the planet by far.  In fact, other currencies that would not have suffered losses against the greenback probably will for the coming weeks.  When the dust clears and the confusion settles down, expect the Dollar to slide again.  Best of luck to you!
c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Hi again.  I am not sure I understand your question.  Do you mean a mutual fund investment portfolio?  If so, you can get all the info you need from http://www.morningstar.com/ .  They rate the funds for you and give very specific information, including charts.  You can choose from a very wide list of mutual funds that specialise in investing in everything from Large-Cap/Blue Chips to Emerging Markets and everything in between.  Look for funds that have high year-over-year returns, have a very low expense ratio (less than 1.0...), funds that re-invest dividends and are investing in the areas of the market you see trending up going forward.  (Personally, I think it is metals, myself...)    Mutual funds may not be the best way to go in the current market environment, however.  There are too many managers getting too fat and too rich and not making any money for their clients.  In that case, you can actually be your own mutual fund by investing in and rotating through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs...).  You can do it in a cyclical fashion, as well.  Put money into shares of metal ETFs like gold and silver.  Then you may sell it at the peak and move the funds to the Indexes, such as the QQQQ (NASDAQ Index...) or the SPX (S & P 500 Index...) as they begin to move higher in Spring of 2007.  There may be no better time than then to buy into these ETFs for many years to come after that.  Best of all, you can hold the Gold ETFs as they go through the roof and pump money into the Q's, giving you an automatic, built-in diversification factor.  The tax situation is better for these types of investments, too.  Talk to your advisor about that.  I hope that helps!  Best of luck to you!

d3ca448b534cead13da01e13e2f3d1b5aa	What it means in my opinion is the borrowing of free money for hedge funds is over.  The liquidity they exercised prevented the housing bubble from popping because they were borrowing Japanese Yen to fund speculative purchases in real estate and commodities.  Now that the free money is gone, there has been a correction in commodities (albeit short lived since the US $ is weakening in comparison to other currencies) and a strong correction in real estate should be on the way shortly.  US GDP should be lower for 2006 and 2007 then 2003-2005 and you can also expect the US large cap stock market to be rather stagnant during this time period.    All in all, the US economy should slow quite a bit, and hopefully the FED is done tightening because it takes 6-9 months for increases in the FED's funds rate to impact the economy so they may have overdone the raising already.  Hopefully a recession is not in the cards.    Hope that helps,    m|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Well, there is nothing at all sudden about it.  It has been expected for some time.  In the late 1980's Japan was experiencing their greatest economic boom.  They were buying Manhattan and Hawaii at an enormous rate.  Everyone had money.  A square foot of Tokyo cost $128,000.  Then, reality set in.  There was no way the Japanese could keep up with the Japanese and their economy collapsed because things were just too expensive for the average Joe to afford.  Their money collapsed, they had to sell back Hawaii and Manhattan at tremendous losses and their economy suffered what is termed deflation- a very, very serious economic disease.  Prices plummeted.  The house that was worth $350,000 yesterday was worth $140,000 today.  Not good.  After that, the Japanese, notorious as savers, got even more so.  They bought nothing and worked like crazy.  The economy was doing nothing, so the government dropped the interest rates to zero, hoping to spur some kind of spending.  Ten years later, prices have started to pick back up but thankfully not at the same rate they were rising before.  Now, the government feels comfortable charging people for borrowing money...a mere quarter of a percent interest.    In the meantime, they have made it illegal to resell used electronic equipment.  New DVD players are sitting in the trash because the owner got a new Blue-Ray player.|`|f7c667ca175bea333b9f4b15f426835caa	Well, as we all know that Hight rate is bad for corporate earning because it raises  business expense in all units, but in order to balance the economy then the economic analyst and the people in Japan government have to raise the interest rate when they see the economy abruptly growing. They just don't want to repeat the lesson they learned in 1990......Why??? Because they don't want the saving rate exceed the expenditure aggregate and planned investment spending.... According the the Economic study, it's imparative that all saving be borrowed and  spent  on current  output, and if planned investment  spending is less than saving, there are no compensating increases in net exports or goverment spending, aggregate expenditures will be insufficient to purchase the output that is produced.  Inventories will rise, firms will cut back production and it will increases the unemployment rate and other subsequences in long term, because  real GDP not the nominal GDP "which the main key that drives the economy of a country" will likely fall.  That's the reason why Japan suddenly raised their interest rate from 0% to .25%

Another scenario you should look at is if real estate prices correct by 5%-10% and then add another 3%-6% for realtor fees if you plan on using a realtor.  Real Estate goes up in value if you look at the historical data, but there dips here and there.  Mortgage rates are nearing 7% so the real estate boom has definitely slowed down.  If you can afford the payments definitely keep it.  If you are paying principal and interest on your loan, perhaps you should explore  a 7 or 10 year interest only mortgage to see if there would  be any substantial savings.   If you are experiencing a financial problem and the problem seems to only get worse and you have no future sources of extra revenue coming in, you may want to cut your losses and sell your home.

Some people like running numbers and what may seem boring to somebody is another person's passion.  A description of an Accountant definitely entails somebody who is organized, detail oriented, and is good with numbers.  They must also accept responsibility, ie., doing somebody's taxes properly because they are the professional.  So like any profession, accounting comes with a set of responsibilities and you are expected to be an expert.   The pros are you can enter any industry and you can decide to work for a big firm, small firm, or start your own business.  Getting a CPA license does require some dedication and experience.

So just why is China investing in Africa?  1) Who else is going to sell it to them? Canada? The US?  2) The Middle East is just too unstable.  3) Africa is willing cos China is willing to invest in their infrastructure, which is more than I can say for the Western countries.  4) The west is not so willing to trade with countries with a poor human rights record. China doesn't really care, doesn't criticise others' domestic affairs and doesn't really have a fantastic record of their own.  5) Political power - perhaps chequebook diplomacy. Building relations with small impoverished nations gives China more votes in the UN.

395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	Basically it's like a savings account, but you can only withdraw the money at a certain time. CDs (at least when I worked at the bank) ranged from one week to 10 years. You usually get a higher interest rate on a CD since the money is guaranteed to the bank. (They can loan part of your money to others in car loans, mortgages, etc, it's normal and legal.) The longer the term on the CD, the better rate you should get.    I think CDs are an excellent way to invest as long as you KNOW you won't need the money soon. If you have to withdraw the money early, the bank will charge you a penalty.    Most CDs will renewed automatically if you don't close them, so they will keep going forever.    If you have further questions or I confused you, you can contact me through my profile.

The term of the CD can be anywhere from a few months to much longer.  CD's usually pay a higher interest rate than most other deposit accounts because the money is "locked in" as far as the bank is concerned.  The other consideration is the minimum amount to be deposited.   This is set by the bank and can be any amount they want, usually $1000 but it could be more or less.  I consider them a good place for a beginner to put money because they are insured by the FDIC.   If you go with this option shop around for the best rates and periods according to how long you can lock up the money.

At the age of 29, I was turned down by my bank for a career development loan to undertake a degree despite the course leading to a professional qualificiation, with a 95% graduate employment rate. Fortunately, my LEA stepped in and funded me as it was the first time I had undertaken degree-level study.     When it came to studying for my masters, I didn't anticipate having a problem as I was working part-time. However, when I lost my job, my bank didn't exactly help. I ended up having to put the entire cost of six months of my spending whilst I completed my course onto my credit card. The moment I graduated, the bank were fine about giving me a 'graduate loan', but they wouldn't agree to lending the money for the same course in advance!!!!! The funding of mature students in this country leaves a lot to be desired. Whilst 18 year olds get given 30 a week as an educational maintenance allowance, people who have worked and paid tax and national insurance all their life are denied the opportunity of a higher education because of their age by a combination of government policy and the lending policies of the banks.     I empathise for your husband's position, but I would caution him - the debt I incurred as a student has crippled me for the remainder of my life. Whilst other friends, who did not go to university have now settlled happily into comfortable lifestyles with hundreds of thousands of pounds of equity in their homes, I will be forever living in rented accommodation, repaying a debt spread between the student loan company and a graduate loan to my bank. Then, of course, I will enter retirement with fewer years of pensionable service than my peers because of the time spent in education, so will be doubly penalised and receive less money then too. I would encourage your husband to consider the 'opportunity' he is being presented with carefully and to explore all possible options.     For example, part-time study, with part-time work may be a way to cover the costs. Or, distance learning through someone like the open university where he could work full-time but study part-time in his own time at his own pace. 'Module grazing' as it's called, simply accumulating credits at a pace of the students own choice, seems to be increasingly popular for mature students who are faced with the work-study dilemma.     Is it possible for example to do the same course at a different institution in a different mode of attendance? My Masters degree for example only required nine days of attendance on the campus over the entire course of the year. The rest was done at a distance. I would urge you to consider not just one option, but all options and to get additional advice from your local educational authority as to possible sources of funding for post-graduate study. Even if they only offer advice, they will likely be aware of lending decisions and funding opportunities that you may not necessarily have considered.    Good luck and may your choice be a well-informed one.|`|AA12311758	A career development loan.    Career Development Loans (CDLs) are one of the major strands of the Governments agenda for lifelong learning. Their aim is to help people overcome the financial barriers to learning by making it easier for them to manage, plan and invest in their own learning.     CDLs are a longstanding programme, available within Great Britain (GB), intended to help remove the financial barrier to learning. Their aims are to increase the amount of vocational learning, encourage more individuals to take responsibility for their own learning, and to encourage financial institutions to view learning as an investment worthy of a loan.     This Guide has been designed for use by learning providers for individuals who wish to fund their education or learning through the CDL programme. It details the eligibility conditions for CDLs and the role and requirements of the learning provider. /more       --------------------------------------...

If you die without a will, most states will provide one for you - even if you have family.  This is not desirable.    If there is a will, it is still possible that all assets will be sold to cover any outstanding debts.    In the end, it is most likely that the house will be sold, either by the estate, the state, or the bank.      For example, in California, dead people cannot own property.  Title must transfer to a living person, trust, corporation, etc.  - It must transfer to some living entity.

Espero que voc tambem siga e possamos juntos ganhar muito dinheiro. Vamos L. N?o tem nada a perder.         Prosperidade e Auto Ajuda, baseada em nmeros perfeitos.     Se voc for uma pessoa decidida, leia at o final. Com certeza vai ficar feliz por ter recebido este e-mail. Entretanto, se for ctico e pessimista, n?o perca tempo, n?o leia, pois este assunto nada tem a haver com voc.         Bem, se voc est lendo esta linha  porque quer continuar a ler. OK! Vamos l!     : Meu nome  Leonardo moura e sou um pequeno empresrio. Em Junho de 2002, recebi pelo correio eletr?nico uma informa??o inusitada.  claro, ela veio espontaneamente. Simplesmente pegaram meu nome/e-mail em algum cadastro de mala direta ou de algum provedor. Gra?as a Deus por isto! Depois de ter lido a informa??o por vrias vezes, mal pude acreditar no que meus olhos tinham visto. Diante de mim estava uma estupenda maneira de resolver todos os meus problemas. Eu n?o teria que investir quase nada,e mais, sem me endividar novamente. Logo peguei um papel e caneta e comecei a fazer alguns clculos.     : Conclui que o que iria fazer era um investimento baixssimo e, no mnimo, ainda assim, teria minha aplica??o de volta. Pensei: Por que n?o? Pior do que eu estava n?o poderia ficar". Segui as instru??es correta e minuciosamente. Enviei, inicialmente, 250 e-mails, dinheiro come?ou a chegar. Vagarosamente no incio, mas aps algumas semanas eu estava recebendo mais e-mails do que poderia ter em um dia. Passados trs meses, mais ou menos, o dinheiro parou de chegar. Como tinha feito um registro preciso do dinheiro recebido, fiquei estarrecido. O final totalizava R$ 598.494,00 (Quinhentos e noventa e oito mil, quatrocentos e noventa e quatro reais)     : Fantstico!!! Paguei todas as minhas dvidas, comprei um carro novo, uma bela casa e enviei de forma intercalada (quatro vezes de 250) mais 1.000 cartas/e-mails. Em quatro meses, aproximadamente, recebi R$ 2.694.218,00 (Dois milh?es, seiscentos e noventa e quatro mil, duzentos e dezoito reais).     : Leia atentamente este programa. Ele pode mudar sua vida para sempre.     : Lembre-se: este programa n?o funciona, se n?o for colocado em prtica de forma correta e como indicado nas instru??es adiante.     : Esta  uma grande oportunidade, com pouqussimo custo ou risco.             INSTRU??ES             Siga exatamente as simples instru??es abaixo, e em trs meses aproximadamente voc receber mais de R$ 300.000,00 (Trezentos mil reais).     :                 GARANTIDO MESMO             N.. (1). Imediatamente, mande R$ 2,00 (dois reais) para cada uma as seis pessoas que est?o relacionadas na listagem adiante. Da seguinte forma: deposite esta quantia na conta-corrente ou poupan?a delas e n?o se aborre?a caso tenha que ir a vrias agncias bancrias.     : (H uma lei divina que exige algum sacrifcio (imola??o) ou trabalho cansativo arduo para se obter os resultados desejados.)         N. (2). Quando depositar os R$ 2,00 (dois reais) na conta-corrente ou poupan?a das seis pessoas da lista, voc precisa mandar um e-mail para cada uma delas dizendo:                                                  O nmero do comprovante do depsito bancrio e     : "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja includo no seu cadastro de correspondncias". Esta  a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a opera??o bancria e fica de acordo com a legisla??o vigente. A legisla??o diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servi?o. Este  o servi?o! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depsitos em sua conta far?o o mesmo.)             N. (3}. Aps ter depositado os R$ 2,00 (dois reais) para cada uma das seis pessoas, digite uma nova lista. Em seguida tire o nome que est no nmero 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posi??o cima (o segundo nome passa para o n 1, o terceiro para o n 2 e assim por diante, at que o sexto nome assuma a posi??o no 5 e o seu nome passa ent?o a ser o no 6).     : Em nenhuma hiptese mude a seqncia de nomes. N?o coloque seu nome em uma posi??o diferente, pois n?o funciona. Seu nome dever estar no n 6. (Caso voc mude a seqncia de nomes, isso denotar egosmo e contraria os princpios bsicos da solidariedade e fraternidade estabelecidos por lei divina - como voc ver  frente.)             N. (4). Pegue 250 nomes/e-mails em alguma empresa que forne?a mala direta. O jornal Folha de S?o Paulo, O Globo e outros, por exemplo, tm em suas pginas de classificados anncios oferecendo listagens a baixo pre?o ou se preferir mande 250 mensagens para salas de discuss?es,newsgroups,rede de bbs,frum,mural,e outros formas de postagem na net.  Obs:para achar frum,mural,sala de discuss?es e outros procure em sites de busca.             N. (5). Completada a etapa anterior (n 4), insira os nomes/e-mails coletados nos arquivos de seu programa de E-Mails - outlook ou outro - e envie com esse mesmo texto. Voc dever salvar sua lista no formato TXT ou Rich Text Format, porque muitas pessoas n?o tm um processador de texto moderno - nos formatos sugeridos a carta/e-mail abre em qualquer computador.  bom enviar aos poucos.

5439794348d2ff0d2a58315b360ceebbaa	Talk about an ugly chart my friend, but i think there is more downsideThere's going to be a push towards the solar panels eventually-imho, but the heat waves are temporary. The best time to pick up these companies are when they are hated beyond recognition to the upside. Plus, I think that Q-Cells AG and Renewable Energy Corporation ASA partnership is an interesting one...at least that ESLR is trying to get out there and market the product, instead of sitting out there (like a few of these renewable energy companies). In addition the stock trades at a a discount from where Cramer  started recommending it. However, the company must learn to start finding a way to start producing the panels with out so much cost. Silicon prices are following the general trend with all the other metals, which is to be expected, but this is the best company to be in--if you had to be invested in this sector.    From a technical stand point....http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=ESLR&p=...    The stock needs to set a clear bottom and hold it....it appears to have done that several times, but has broken the bottom pennet.

There is, however some nice support at $7 that you can take advantage of.  Dec 7.50 Puts on the stock (QLUXU) are currently trading at about $0.40-0.45.  This may be a way to double your money over the next couple of months or so.  Looking at the chart, the dip to seven dollars looks pretty inevitable, especially given the fact that BP is investing big-time in thin-film solar panels that are basically malleable to the contour of a structure and use no silicone in their manufacture.  Things don't look good for Evergreen Solar stock prices.

They do offer a good range of services, and occasionally a good offer on interest rates.  If Bank of America's Keep the Change program interests you, you can actually do this yourself to your financial records by rounding up on all checks and debit card transactions.

These pay very low, but provide great connections and much-needed work experience.     Of course, you could always apply for a student loan.

AA10464818	Unlike what you heard, the government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for buying cars, paying bills, and even the Housing and Urban Development does not provide grants for individuals for buying homes. http://www.hud.gov/grants/index.cfm    Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.    There there is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|68a1a876775e77b047d17f32f3e784a2aa	Xcuse me!!! if you tell me which country you live in I will come there.

202132abdbe3015bd9e731d2a7a7fa94aa	here is some advice for starting out:    More and more, we are taking on the bulk of the costs of life. Corporations are cashing out pensions, putting more of the cost of medical insurance on us by way of higher premiums, copays and deductibles. We are funding more for disability, and long term care. Social security may be privatized in which case some very simple math will show most of us will do worse.    If you are 18 today and you retire at 67 with a million dollar investment portfolio, that will safely generate $60K/year. But when you are 67, that 60K will only have the buying power of a little over $13K/year. It gets worse though, because at 67, you will still probably have 30 more years to live and that 13K will shrink each year until its only worth $7/year at age 90.    A million dollars isnt what it used to be and it will be even less in the future.    So. We must all become educated investors much more so then our parents were. These are some basic steps to get you started.      Step 1.   First decide what kind of brokerage you want to work with. You can open a brokerage account in your bank, with a large full service brokerage or an internet brokerage. I find when I get help, most people want to sell me things that are better for them. So I use www.scottrade.com because its cheap and easy with low frills. I do my own research and make my own investments. But any low cost internet brokerage service is fine.    Step 2. get a subscription to Barrons or Investors Business Daily Do this for 6 months or a year. At first, It seems a bit mysterious, but pretty soon you start to understand the terms and what investors are looking for and what they are afraid of    Step 3. If you have some money to invest, put it in 3 month CDs right now. First the market is unstable and second you have some homework in Step 3 to do before you do any investing.    Step 3. Go out to the internet and search on the following subjects. Get familiar with the concepts.  Asset allocation   Long term investing  inflation    Roth ira vs ira  Large med small cap  Value vs growth  Indexed mutual funds  ETF  Sector funds  Bonds CD  International funds  Market cycles  Fundamental analysis  Technical analysis      Step 4 go to http://clearstation.etrade.com/ (its a part of e*trade which is also a low cost brokerage) and sign up for a free account. Play around there by looking at graphs and fundamentals.   I think its also a good idea to pretend you have $10,000 and start buying and selling on paper. Keep track of where you are each day for a month Its a lot easier to lose play money then real money.    Step 5. Its always a good Idea to see a CFP (certified financial planner). Their job is to work for your benefit, not to sell you investments. They can cover subjects like employee benefits, insurance, budgeting, living trusts, 401k, taxes and real estate as well as investment types and investment types to keep away from.    Always strive to do your own research youll find everyone sounds like an expert so take everything people tell you with a grain of salt. Its not easy in the beginning but soon you will be the expert.    Dont get involved with futures, currency, options (unless you get stock options at work), commodities, annuities and other derivative type investments at this time.

Nelle aziende importanti non se ne fregano nulla delle gambe ma si fregano che se scrivi delle lettere commerciali ad esempio non fai gli strafalcioni che qualche volta invece hai sfoggiato qui su Answers e che si evitano andando a scuola.  Prova ad esempio un ambiente a te pi congeniale, perch non cerchi lavoro in discoteca? Saresti a tuo agio in mini e truccata e non avresti bisogno di aprire bocca, quantomeno non per parlare...

I dont suggest this often but you need to make-up a employer and have someone who will say you worked for them, a friend, relative, whoever. Its a sad day when a person has to lie to get a job but thats the way this country is headed with this loss of privacy we have. You must create a fake job and study it in case you are questioned in detail about what you did there, pay-rate, certain situations that happened, ect. Most employers dont call references or past employers but the good ones do, so if you want a good job you need to lie, sorry but its true.|`|AA12236211	hell no; just playing, sure   dont worry

Compra titoli con valore max di 5 ; per lo stesso motivo e per minore svalutazione. Non seguire le valutazioni degli esperti; sono tutti condizionati o interessati a togliere i soldi di tasca agli allocchi; segui il valore medio dell'azione e compra quando v sotto.

Always pay more than the minimum due and never let them get behind again. Try a gas card or something like that. You may have to get secured ones to start with. The most important thing is to not let anything else get behind or go into collection again. A car dealer once told me "we don't care about the bankruptcy we just look to see how you are doing since then."|`|AA11107151	I've been using a credit repair company that has brought my credit score from 520 to 660 in the course of 6 months ... she is still doing things to my account.

Since you are not pressured to by a home in the next 60 days there are many options to help you obtain your dream of homeownership.    1. Check your credit - Get a copy of your credit report with credit scores.  You can get a free copy with out scores from the Federal Trade Commission www.ftc.gov or you can buy a copy from the credit bureaus themselves. (websites below)    2. Improve your score - Everyones situation is different. Some things you can do to improve your score are:   - Pay your bills on time   - Get credit balances below 75%, 50%, 35% of available credit   - Do not open any new accounts or apply for additional credit   - Do not close any accounts   - Dispute errors on your report  For more information on credit go to Fair Isaac's site (they created the credit score) www.myFICO.com  There are companies that can assist you in improving your score.  Please note everything they do, you can do for free on your own.    3. Consult with a loan officer to see what programs you qualify for now and what you need to qualify for better programs.    4. Many cities and states have First Time Home Buyer (FTHB)Assistance.  There are income and credit requirements. Check their respective web sites under the housing dept for more info.  This will also provide you with the best source of programs available in your area.    ~Danke Schoen    Feel free to contact me with any other questions or a second opinion.

Naturally, your income, job history, debt load and credit all play a role in which program you qualify for.    I can finance anyone 100% no matter what their credit is like--so long as they make enough money to afford the home. Other lenders can't say this, but I am a nationally know credit and loan expert.|`|AA10001157	As housing market continues to slump, if you don't plan to delay your plan, please interview several and pick a good realtor or agent.    Bad ones will talk you into buying the largest property at your credit limit.  Good ones will find you a good deal (Sellers are offering discount and incentives now).    Try to stay away from Adjustable Mortgage, because 30 year fix mortgage rate is very low right now.  There is no reason to use Adjustable loans except fatter commission for loan agents.    Interests only loans are not good iether.  Mortgage payment consists of two parts: interests and principal.  Interests are like rent, which doesn't add to the equity to your house.  It simply disappear as your pay it.  If you want to use interests only loans, might as well rent, especially during market downturn, because housing price won't appreciate.    Finally, for tax benefits, talk to your CPA or tax accountant.  Do not consult finance with realtors or agents.  They get commissions when you sign the check!

We just bought a house and even though we used my husband's VA loan they also had many 1st time buyer programs as well.  I think one of the better ones required you to attend a class on homeownership, but other than that it was pretty standard.  So yes they are legit and sponsored by the government or the community, and the interest rates are usually set at a pretty decent rate.|`|57806c3adece8e6f00048bd7eb209210aa	It will all depend on your credit score and the income that you make to find you the right program.    If you have a credit score of 640 or higher you will get a better rate.  For first time home buyers you can qualify for 100% loans, 80/20 programs and arm programs.    With the interest only/arm programs, the payments are lower than say a 30 or 40 year term.    If you would like more info you can email me at mmorganloans@yahoo.com.

d3626b45b25d5c4c740a383f4a304233aa	In this day and age, the concept of buyers beware no longer applies. The seller in most states is required to disclose defects that may affect the value of the property, including "latent" defects (defects that is not easily visible by the naked eye). While Colorado is still very much a "buyers beware state", sellers are required to disclose to you latent defects if they are aware of the problem. In additional to that, if the seller deliberately cover up the defect, they may be guilty of concealment. Examples of latent defect would be termite infestations, roof leak, or say a flooded basement during heavy rain.    To protect yourself, you should ask the seller for a copy of the latent defect  disclosure in writing. Then as a condition of the purchase, you should make the contract contingent on a home inspection. Go ahead and hire a licensed home inspector and go through the house. If you find the damages unacceptable, have the seller repair the damage, reduce the price or walk away from it. As additional resource go to this site:  http://www.mikecooke.com/reports/srnocou...|`|3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	Our research department has these links on real estate laws in the state of Colorado, LAWS: http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/o...

However before you take the task to interpret these laws on your own you should look to these links as information so that you will be able to ask a local attorney the right questions.  Please understand that in Colorado a seller is not required to disclose latent defects they only have a duty not an obligation to disclose. This however is not true if they use the approved form by Colorado and according to paragraph 10 of that form they are then obligated to disclose.

It is unlikely things will brighten up in a few months, afterall, this bubble took 5 years for form.    It might be better to give some discount so you unload the house quickly and can use the gain of the home to make money elsewhere quickly.  At the same time, you will save money by not paying mortgage for the next 5 months.    For example, if mortgage is $2500/mo. and you have $300,000 gain sitting in the house, by selling it now rather than 5 months later will save you $12500.  It will also earn you as much as $7000 from interests (Assuming CD are paying 5.5% or higher).    Total financial benefit for selling early would be $20,000.  I would give buyer some discount just because of that.    Finally, keeping a house in selling condition is a lot of work.  If your realtor does staging, it costs extra to rent furnitures.  If you are living in the unit, it takes extra effort to keep it clean.

fdc8ee0c67a614f66006e30b30c2afaeaa	I clienti affluent si distinguono per il grado di sofisticazione finanziaria. Tendenzialmente, quindi, oltre a fornirgli una vasta gamma di prodotti tra cui scegliere a seconda delle proprie esigenze e della propria propensione al rischio, bisogna loro erogare un livello di livello di servizio pi elevato. Il motivo? Sono molto ricercati dalla concorrenza e dunque non  facile, una volta acquisiti, mantenerli. E lopinione di Antonio Bragh, responsabile dei canali diretti di Sanpaolo Imi. In questo contesto, spiega Bragh, anche Internet gioca allora un ruolo fondamentale, perch, sebbene i nostri clienti non appartengano alla fascia che per definizione utilizza maggiormente la rete (i giovanissimi), in quanto la gran parte ha dai 35 anni in su e non sono pochi gli over 50, ai clienti pi facoltosi piace gestire i propri soldi in maniera attiva, dove e quando vogliono. Desiderano pertanto disporre di pi canali e strumenti operativi. Ci premesso, aggiunge Bragh, la divisione di cui faccio parte contribuisce a dare a questa fascia di clientela servizi di natura rendicontativa, informazioni generali sullandamento della borsa e sul valore in tempo reale del portafoglio amministrato.       Dipendenti informati, clienti soddisfatti E ovvio che per servire meglio i clienti (ad oggi i clienti affluent di Sanpaolo Imi sono circa 500mila), bisogna dotare di strumenti adeguati chi si occupa di gestire direttamente la relazione. Una unica struttura, riprende Bragh, aggiorna infatti informazioni e quotazioni sia per i clienti, su Internet, sia per i dipendenti, sulla intranet del gruppo. In tal modo i gestori della relazione sono facilitati in quello che  il loro compito principale: portare avanti al meglio il rapporto con la clientela loro affidata, intervenendo tempestivamente sulle scelte di investimento, proponendo prodotti giusti al momento giusto, attraverso una rendicontazione puntuale e precisa. Solo cos  possibile trasformare il rapporto in una relazione continuativa nel tempo. E proprio per trasformare la relazione con il cliente in qualcosa di duraturo e soddisfacente per entrambe le parti, Sanpaolo Imi si  data delle regole di gestione interna. Si tratta di regole di comportamento e di deontologia finanziaria. Dato che  ormai assodato che prevedere landamento dei mercati non  proprio semplicissimo, sottolinea Bragh, bisogna assolutamente focalizzare le proprie energie sulle esigenze del cliente. Questo impegno lo si pu mantenere sia diversificando gli strumenti di investimento, sia suggerendo, quando ritenuto opportuno, operazioni di ritocco al portafoglio, privilegiando in questo caso non singoli titoli, ma strumenti di risparmio gestito. Il tutto tenendo sempre informato il cliente, attraverso il canale che lui preferisce, senza dimenticare che per la fascia affluent il contatto personale, ovviamente, rimane prioritario e assolutamente ineliminabile.|`|fbeb93bb98dba18c862fb35904656226aa	quelli che hanno tanti soldi.|`|6142c00e907138d832b7531a3fef5813aa	il cliente affluent richiede un servizio il pi possibile personalizzato, e quindi  ... ad esempio) affinch anche il cliente affluent possa valutare i propri asset|`|5f91cf42b595eb4ddb44a5c7ec4c12dcaa	E' una delle novit peggiori del Marketing.

La moda  di clusterizzare (dividere in gruppi omogenei) i clienti secondo le esigenze per poi fornirgli risposte adeguate.  Messa cos sembra anche giusta come idea, peccato che non ci si rivolge a macchine ma a persona con caratteri, et, storie, sentimenti e punti di vista diversi gli uni dagli altri. Non puoi omogeneizzare i sentimenti delle persone.  Avere 300.000,00 euro di liquidit per alcuni  tanto per altri  poco, per altri i risparmi di una vita, per altri un sogno da realizzare, per altri una montagna da far crescere e non  assurdo per alcuni  solo uno dei tanti conti correnti.

It also said that In terms of lead generation, only referrals and repeat clients rank above the Internet as the most effective methods of gaining new business.     Unfortunately the real estate industry is a little bit behind in marketing themselves online, so having a website that displays the MLS data with an integrated IDX feed is probably your best bet to beat the competition. Especially since most of the real estate being sold is being done so by the newly established realtors who have mastered online marketing.     Some good website design companies are http://www.bayshoresolutions.com  or http://www.13avenue.com     But the real kicker is being able to display MLS listings on your site and integrate search tools using an IDX feed.

AA10382414	It's a good way to save money on a short-term basis. You can open a CD with a minimum requirement for 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. It earns interest with time. If you let the money sit there until the CD matures (time expires), you get to cash in on the money saved plus the interest earned. It's a low percentage but it's usually higher than a savings account. There are penalties also if you close the CD before the time frame allotted.|`|AA10382554	CDs are a good thing to have because it allows you to earn interest over money you have. Interest rates for CDs are low, but it's better than nothing.    CDs are a safe way for investing. The outcome is reasonably predictable.     Say the interest for the CD is 5%  And you agree to a place $500 in a CD for 1 year.    At the end of one year, instead of having $500 you have $525.  At the end of the second year, you'd have $551.25    Over 2 years, the money would have grown by $ 51 dollars you didn't place into the CD yourself.     The cumulative effect of CDs is where the value is.   If you have a CD for 20 years or so and leave it untouched. The money really grows, especially when it's a larger amount.    Be sure to (1) find the highest interest in your area (local banks or credit unions offer CDs) before committing to one and (2) resist the temptation to remove the money before the time frame (some have penalties).

7a6fa7cc2f844989fcfae1cb4372f24baa	Your assests do not matter with Social Security disability.  They do matter with SSI because SSI is a welfare type program based on need.  The assests you have could possibly disqualify you for SSI even though you were approved medically.  But, if you do not tell them, records from the state and tax/IRS/DSS records cross systems with Social Security.  Eventually, they will know, and you will have to repay all the SSI.  And, possibly go to jail for fraud.  But, remember you can still get Soc Sec Dis with any assests.|`|157b173f58bb84abd1e98e2a8bfc1ac1aa	If you are collecting rental income from the old mobile home - SSI needs to know about this and you would be disqualified for SSI.  You may even be disqualified for SSDI because that 1/2 acre of land and old motorhome is worth money that you can sell to survive.  My advice would be to spill the beans - they cannot prosecute you as long as you never benefited financially from not telling them.  You may want to confer with a lawyer just to be on the safe side.    SSI rejected me because they thought I was receiving $50,000 from a house sale when I only received $1,000.  SSI rejected me again because I received "phantom" SSDI checks.  So, forget SSI for me.  My wife receives SSI because she never worked enough to pay into the system for receiving SSDI.

AA11317014	Really australia needs to cut back on red tape and the number of people handling it and focus more on trades and service areas. The lack of water will impact more heavily and cause the price of anything that uses it upward. Rates rises will mean less spending money and so that will slow up alot of industry as well. Fuel prices will change the way we buy cars and how often we shop. The list goes on.

The love you have is for giving away. If you have no-one to give it to, you cannot really know it. Every relationship in the world is based on the exchange theory. We all want from the other. This is not a greed or money thing. You have a job, your boss expects work, you expect pay. Your love, expects to receive your love, and you thiers. This is where the saying it is better to give than to receive really comes true. Once you live life together, your love is made stonger as you face lifes problems and make decisions together. This is where my husband believes Real, True, and Deep love resides. Always remember though, with no one to not only share love with, but also Grow it with, love remains a mere thing you may not fully treasure.|`|AA11018224	A great secret of measurement is how you succeed is to go through life as a person who never gets used up.Who we are- we are human beings and what we do- we believe love as a sex and reproduction.

Look to that for clarification  - and ask the creditor for a written statement detailing what you owe them and how much you have paid.    If you kept copies of the cancelled checks, this will be rather straight forward to fix.  Call the court this judgment has been entered into (the general number) and tell them what you have paid.  They will either direct you to which form to file (you can do this without a lawyer) or they will tell you how to contact a lawyer.    The key here is to make sure you're not paying back more than you should.

They can be reached easily at http://www.bbb.org and the website will locate your local bureau.  They should already have a profile of your supplier in their database and if not, they will add one with your help.  They will attempt to contact organizations and businesses to resolve complaints, and from my experience they are quite quick at this.  But this depends upon the willingness of the business to cooperate, and failing to cooperate will result in an unsatisfactory report and consumer warnings.

6ba4be0c96ac2c327cef20ded0d7c5a2aa	PLEASE TAKE THIS AS A GOOD WORD OF ADVICE:  Most likely, if a company is calling you to recruit you before you even apply, then you will probably NOT want to work for that company anyway! Consider the type of work it is, If it is an entry level job then it is reasonable to assume the company has a high employee turnaround (which means employees dont stay for long because they dont like the job)   Consider this a good sign that they are not calling you back, they are probably still in the process of recruiting and may call you back after a week or so when they begin the interview processes. If i'ts only been a few days, it might take longer. just be a bit more patient but also keep putting your resume out there! If the company has to sell you on the job more than you have to sell them on yourself, there is something wrong about the position.

However, I suspect some areas are a bit less pleasant than others.  In general the south side is safer (i.e., richer and more dear) than the north side.  Jobstown should probably be avoided.  I've heard negative comments about some (but certainly not all) neighborhoods on the near north side.  Ballymun, Finglas, Artane, Crumlin traditionally don't have the best reputations.      But I would emphasize, the differences between good and bad neighborhoods are likely to be minimal.  And you may end up saving some money by living someplace like Crumlin.

State Any consquences that they may have  ( late fee, whatever)    if it is a person who you are friends with, state the hardship it puts you in not to have the thing you are demanding.    Prehaps offer to accept payments, or something.

And, I may be wrong about this, but I once heard that you don't necessarily need to study law to pass the BAR. If you pass the BAR, you can become a lawyer. However, find a firm that will higher you without any law school... well... THAT seems like it would be very hard.    Also, know this: Not ALL who go to Law School actually pass the BAR. They may try and try and try, but many do not pass...|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	and even before Law School, you have to complete an undergraduate degree.|`|66dc5ee24487c2594902f1171b5c678faa	You have to become a lawyer first and then to become a judge,you have to be elected.

Your boss may thank you for this.|`|ginbirt8aa	in my experiance the best answer is to be slightly aggressive.

tebaqfYAaa	Hi  I sell on eBay.  I profit about $3,500 a month and only work about 6 hours a day. eBay has been my full time job for 4 years and I have sold 12,000 items. You can start by selling things you already have as your "on the job" training.    Do a search for the item on eBay under COMPLETED LISTINGS. This will give you any items matching your key words with listings that have ended in the last 30 days. This is an excellent way to find starting price, buy it now price, and to find out if there is a demand for the item. Searching COMPLETED LISTINGS is a valuable tool that will help you gain insight on how much an item can sell for.    Please email me directly at elizabethwells815@yahoo.com if I can answer specific questions.|`|wxwZu4Ckaa	i wish i knew|`|a298c127f531e7644229d3a8ce9dc9f7aa	THE BEST CHOICE|`|4643a9f4b7d8e1c56cbbda506c748dc1aa	my mother in law goes to thrift stores and buys bathing suits very  large sizes they have to look brand new and be in excellent condition.anyways those sell good and also wet suits or ski suits she makes a mint on those main two items she's been selling for over 5 yrs also look for old  things like collectibles or very large clothes they are hard to find and there are alot of large people that cant find these sizes good luck ,  baseball cards are good also .|`|CL8ZoHbBaa	usually electronics sell on ebay...ive bought a lot of stuff ranging from car subwoofers to amplifiers|`|7f74bf7f0be15fdc2abf0139c305f7d7aa	I buy alot of music cds off of ebay. The bad thing is that if you come up with a product that you think you can make a killing off of some other wise guy is gonna come along and beat out your prices. I dont buy into the get rich quick ebay schemes, but im certain the right person can make a few extra bucks off of it.|`|99afd72f4096ac91c13cfc9c0c97e947aa	You can do Ebay advanced searches. If you have something in mind to sell then do a search for it in completed listings. It will show what sold and for how much.
