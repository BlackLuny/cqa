YP1DXbBDaa	The baby is moving around and changing position and shifting inside you, even though you may  not feel it.  That can make your  belly appear smaller or larger at different times and can make you uncomfortable or more comfortable on different days.  It's normal for your body to change shape during pregnancy.|`|AvY7Rwvraa	I actually lost 15 ibs. before I started gaining. The doctor said that this is normal for some women. Now I have only gained 5 ibs. and I am 61/2 months pregnant. Ask your doctor what him/her think.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	The baby could have just moved and made it look smaller or measure smaller.|`|u4FUeppNaa	the baby could just be in a different position
96HWpdkFaa	Well BC can change your periods and make it lighter or turn it to spotting, that's why alot of women with heavy periods like the pill. No one can say YES or NO cause we have no idea. She will need to take a test to be safe.
G9ywiLqvaa	cool one, lea!  my husband and i were just talking about this over dinner!<br>  <br>  our 7-year old inherited both my and hubby's love for art.  he paints and sculpts like his father.  he's quite a handy man, too --just like his father.  he writes stories and loves to tinker with the laptop just like me.  and sadly, he's got a sassy mouth --gulp, just like me.  when we get into an argument, there's no end to it until my hubby brings out the ice cream.  haha!<br>  <br>  our 5-year old got bits from both of us, too.  he loves music.  he loves to dance just like me.  he's quite a little clubber.  lol!  and he's sweet and charismatic, just like his father.  he's very athletic --again from his father.  but he's got this unique hyperactivity that's all his own.  that, i think, he got from the tazmanian devil.  hmm, wonder how he got into the picture. :)|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Long fingers, persistence, quiet spirit, expressive eyes (I am always complimented on her beautiful + bright eyes!).  She is 8 months old.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	I'm afraid Bella's inherited all the things I love about her daddy, and all the things I don't like about myself!<br>  She's inherited his mostly calm and easy-to-please nature, his gorgeous eyes, dimples, fairly stable moods, and great hair.<br>  <br>  She's inherited my temper and stubbornness.<br>  I hope once she's not a baby that energy will channel into tenacity or something good, but geez, if she's a spitfire at 5 months, what's she going to be like in 5 years?|`|nfzQkvqraa	They inherited my perfection.  :)<br>  <br>  Seriously they, like your children, inherited my love of diverse music.  (you'd probably be surprised if you only knew)  Again with the horror movies.  They don't watch horror exactly, but they like to scare themselves within the safety of our home.  <br>  <br>  They are also very compassionate.  I would like to consider myself compassionate as well.|`|apALY0sqaa	My husband loves that our daughter is left-handed like him. And I love that she got all his facial expressions! Her attitude shines through from both of us, and I love that she isn't a morning person, like both of us as well!!!! She is a perfect mixture of our looks, and our personalities- but she is a bit of a tyrant, like her daddy!!!<br>  <br>  Our second is still 16 days from birth, but we can't wait to see her personality is like!!! We are praying she is a night-owl, like us! And has our love of sleep as well!!!!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Cool question. The love of sleep one is the best....lol my girl inheirited my blunt personality and my blonde hair.  My two boys are adopted but i swear they still inheirited my obsession with batman.
ko3Larigaa	If she does probably not much taller. Usually its inbetween the parents heights. shes a foot taller than me. =) and Im 14.
we9sS2tNaa	It sounds like implantation bleeding. I'mplantation bleeding usually happens at about 6-10 days after the egg has stuck itself onto the uterus wall. I would say to take the test around the 10th of march just to be sure. <br>  <br>  Good luck and keep us posted.|`|wqgkC2MIaa	That sounds like both times I had implantation bleeding, I would take a test tomorrow and it it's negitive I would wait another week and take another test....Good luck to you, but it sounds really positive!!|`|FIyPbVipaa	I would wait until you miss your period for at least one to days before u test. It does sound like u may be getting ur period. That's what happened to me this month. My days were about what yours were. I would just wait and see. If u do not get your period by the end of this week. I would test. From what I understand implantation bleeding cramps occur on the side u ovulated from?  It's best to just wait it out. Good luck
vKEYa8aeaa	sounds like you could very well be starting to lose it.
dySHIwYxaa	Nothing wrong with your gut feelings. Most of my friends have had children, but I have decided im not going to have any.<br>  <br>  I spent many hours talking with parents about the pros and cons of having a baby. In conclusion about 50% of parents (once the child has grown out of the cute age) said in hindsight they wish they had not had any children. More often the mothers told me this in confidence. The fathers were less lightly to answer this question, giving answers like "Pointless even thinking about that, it happened and im not disappointed".<br>  <br>  When your best friend has a baby, they start putting on a little pressure on you to have one, Comments like " don't leave it to late" or  "it the best thing that has happen to them, you would be a good dad" Guess they have realized how life changing it is and they would like you to join the baby club.<br>  <br>  Honestly I don't think I would be any happier with a baby, I'm a modern man who understands the effect an extra little person would have on my life, and the effect on the planet. If science is correct and the environment is in great danger, doubling my carbon foot print by having a baby is selfish behavior. No point seeding my jeans at the cost of our planet. <br>  <br>  So when a parents  gives you the guilt trip "your being selfish, not having any children just because you love your freedom" or " your just scared of commitment" you can give them a very good reason, The environment. Trust me, Some broody woman say this kinda stuff.<br>  <br>  It takes a brave person to buck tradition, and re-evaluate social pressure. We are all individual with our own concepts of a utopia.|`|RVUYBxhnaa	Nothings wrong with you =)<br>  It may just be the fact that you do not want the whole 24/7 stress of the responsibility of children, and that's totally understandable. <br>  If you work with the daily, you know how hard they are to control and support, therefore you just feel more comfortable knowing that after a few hours you don't have to stay around them :)|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	It's totally normal!<br>  I felt like that and I am a woman! given time you may change.<br>  Look at me now, I have three, and the bond you share with your own is so much stronger and more special than any other child.|`|xKnCfHe2aa	nothings wrong with you your just not ready for kids<br>  <br>  i dont want them too not cause i dont find kids cute but i just dont see myself as a parent. i want to enjoy my life first.|`|AA11210211	Nothing is wrong hun,Numerous friends said this same thing and I told them it is different when the child is yours and sure enough it was.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Nothing.  You're either not ready to have kids or not meant to have kids.  Not everyone has to have them to be happy.  :-)  Though I have to say that I find it a lot easier to take care of my own kids rather than babysitting someone else's.  For some reason babysitting wears me out a heck of a lot faster.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	Nothings wrong with you, your just scared. You may love children but that doesnt mean your suited to have one.  You can live a perfectly happy life with out children. Who knows you may want one later but right now just isnt right for you and there's nothing wrong with that.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Hey i thought that too...and now i have 3 lol.  Theres nothing wrong with you at all, its really hard and theres nothing wrong with never having kids.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Fear of responsibility,commitment.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Nothing's wrong with you.  Years ago I was lucky enough to get to borrow a kid one or two days a month. From the time he was three until he was seven.  I took him to the zoo, the aquarium, the kids museum.  We had great times together, then I'd take him home.  I could spoil him rotten and not worry about him.  <br>  <br>  I think I got more enjoyment out of him than his own mom!  And I know I taught him things and had an influence on his life.  I don't know if I could have had such a good effect on him, or had so much fun with him, if he was mine.  I think I would have screwed him up for life!<br>  <br>  So I always figured I just make a better 'uncle' than a dad.
LZpbJMTkaa	They recommend waiting 8 weeks, but if you get any pains or vaginal bleeds to stop and go to the doc.
yv94euDBaa	Remy is okay. I like Anne or Anna with anything. Marie is after you, so no comment.<br>  <br>  I'd change that name to Remy Anna Marie.<br>  <br>  Allison Krista Nicole doesn't flow, I like Allison, and I like Krista, but I HATE Nicole. <br>  <br>  I'd change it to Allison Krista Jolene? OR, a little different, maybe Kristabel Allison Jolie?<br>  <br>  I hate Aiden Michael, i'm sorry. I hate Aiden, IT'S SO COMMON. <br>  <br>  Adler Michael is MUCH better personally. Or Alden Michael.<br>  <br>  I like the name Joel, it carries so much sweetness. David on the otherhand is sort of plain. And it makes the whole name very biblical.

I love that Joel honors your mom! :)<br>  <br>  Remy sounds nicknamey, and it's also a French boy's name I believe. I'd love to see Romilly nickname "Romy" instead!<br>  <br>  Your name list has some beautiful names in it, and I love seeing Bailey for a boy! <33<br>  <br>  The only name there that I can't stand is Poppy. It sounds ridiculous and childish and way too close to 'poopy' in my opinion. The kid would be horribly teased. And I can't imagine a "President Poppy" or even a Poppy over the age of 7. Sorry to be harsh!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I really like Allison Krista Nicole <br>  and Aidan Michael is cute =]|`|EXPdJVLaaa	I like all of them. Joel David is my least favorite...

6E7VGyNgaa	yes- but it may take several month for periods to be normal, if worried go see dr

I had some of those symptoms in my early stages too. :-)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|CzAsukYtaa	i would go take another test if i was you if it still comes out negative then u could always go to the drs and get a blood test done as i know for some ppl they dont get a positive on a hpt  for a while my sister didnt get one till she was like 4 or 5 months, goodluck|`|SUIF1DQ2aa	You should go to a doctor and get tested.  the home test kits are not as accurate.|`|FIOOKpz0aa	Yes, its possible take another test or go to the doctor and be tested|`|TMuxrQfdaa	Sounds like you are please see your womens heath center to be sure.|`|5K0eYC35aa	take another test or go to the doctor and be tested|`|HjPPj4Kzaa	i think you need to go to a doctor to get tested because there are a lot of factors that can give you a false negative. it could also be that you missed your period because your stressed about being pregnant and all the other symptoms are in your head. <br>  go to a doctor
nrqWwQBXaa	i have 2 small ones. it does not mess my life up at all. if my kid came home with one it would depend on what the tattoo was?|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I have 2.  I have a tribal around my left ankle and a biohazard on my upper right back.  I hate the bio-hazard, not sure what I was thinking.  I want to have it edited/ changed and I'm trying to figure out a way to do so.  I love the tribal but it was a pretty bold decision (location-wise) and I do sometimes wish I had thought that out a little more.<br>  <br>  I hope I don't have to deal w/ the 2nd question.  I know that sounds hypocritical.  Don't get me wrong, I'm okay w/ my children having them, I just don't want them to make the same mistakes I did.  I don't regret mine but I would have made different decisions if I had waited until I was older (I was 18).  I wish they would raise the legal limit to 21, lol.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Yes I do.  I have my husband's Cav unit crest tattooed on my back in memory of his time served in Iraq.<br>  <br>  It doesn't affect my life as a parent as far as my kids and the way I parent them goes, but I do get comments from the "I'm better than you" crowd.  Apparently tattoos are just so trashy and shamelessly hideous, lol.  That's ok.  They can have their opinions.  It just shows how many people judge based on the exterior.<br>  <br>  I plan on getting more too, but not in places that are obvious.  <br>  <br>  If my teen came home with a tattoo, I'd be furious for two reasons:<br>  <br>  1- They are under the legal age to get a tattoo<br>  2- I don't know what kind of place they got it from and I would be more upset because they put their health at risk.|`|j2mRop0laa	ahem..<br>  fine, I'll admit it.<br>  But they are only noticeable in a bikini or nude.<br>  <br>  That's all I'll admit to about that. lol<br>  <br>  It doesn't affect my life as a mom- no one see them. My kids have but they don't want any. I would really prefer if they ever get one that it is smack dab on their asz cheek because that way if hey regret it, a pair of undies will cover it. If they come home with one as a teen- I'll have it removed. If I have to take them to court to get permission to put them under the knife- they will do it. No tats for under 18.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I have two tattoos.  I've got a unicorn on my ankle that I got when I was 20 and a symbol on my shoulder that mean eternity when I was well 20.  I don't think it affects my parenting at all.  My sons like to look at the unicorn and try to wipe it off.  They almost never notice the one on my shoulder.  If they were old enough to get a tattoo then I wouldn't really care.  I would hope they wouldn't get something stupid (uh, like a unicorn...).|`|AA11210211	I have two small ones,I have a smokers dot on my left hand and I have a little smiley face on the left side of my stomach,It doesn't affect it at all as far as I know.....I think it depends on the age,I will allow my children to get a tattoo or piercing depending on the spot at 16 yrs,nothing before that though.|`|AkFag8tNaa	3. One in my ear and two on my arm. I got two of them in highschool and one just a couple years later and regret the ones on my arm. It doesn't really affect my parenting other than hoping my kids make good decisions about permanent body morphing.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	nope. i hate needles and pain.  im a wussy.  nearly passed out when i got my tongue pierced all the years ago.  <br>  <br>  depends on how old the child was, the placement, and the content of the tattoo.  i could go either way.|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, yes.. I have a tattoo of a big old butterfly on the bottom of my back! It's never affected my life as a parent at all!<br>  <br>  As long as she was 18, then I wouldn't have a problem with it, as long as it can be hidden under clothing, I say that because most people now days don't want to hire people with tattoos that are where they can be seen.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I have 4. It doesn't really effect my life as parent at all, they are hidden most of the time. They're not one of those huge ones that stand out, they're pretty tiny. <br>  <br>  If my child never asked for my permission, of course I would be disappointed, and I would get them in trouble for it.. but what else can I do? If they get a tattoo, it's not like you can go and get it erased. (Well you can, but I doubt that I would ever go to that extent). Especially if they paid for it with their own money.. It would be different if they stole one of my credit cards. I would make them work so they can pay me the money back, that's for sure!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I have 3 and my husband has 2. It doesn't effect either of us as parents at all. If my children wanted one I would just explain it's permanent and make sure it might be something that means something to them. Not to mention here in NJ you have to be 18 and over, I would have no say so anyway.|`|QveBSjFSaa	I have 3, will get more eventually, my husband is covered with them.<br>  My oldest daughter gave herself one when she was 15, and we came unglued. Not because we are ANTI- in any way, more because it is illegal under 18, and we have always told her that we would take her when she turned 18, and buy her one, if that's what she wanted at that time. It's almost like she robbed us of that rite of passage.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I have 4 and my husband currently has none. It doesn't affect my life at all. When my son reaches the age of 16 if he decides he really wants one and it's one we agree on I will take him to get it. Otherwise he can wait until he's 18. If he feels the need to go behind my back I wouldn't be angry. He has to live with it.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i have tattoos and so does my husband. they don't effect my life or my child's life. i dont care if my kids get tattoos as long as they are 18 or older. although i am not against tattoos i had to wait until i was legal age and so will they.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i only have one and its on my lower back so its rarely seen and i dont think its having any affect on my parenting life.  when my child is much older, if they get something that is descreet and tasteful i wouldnt be upset.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I have 4-My first is the Kanji symbol for "love" that I have on my right wrist my husband and I both got them when we got married. My second in my daughters name that I got tattooed around my left ankle in tiny script when she was born. My third was on my lower back and it's chinese for "cherished", and my fourth is a dragon on my right upper arm (high up). Dragons are a symbol of courage, and I got it after my son went into remission after having cancer, because all my kids showed so much courage. My husband has the same symbol as me on his wrist, and has his right upper arm tattooed.<br>  <br>  I love my tattoos-to me they kind of tell the story of my life. <br>  They haven't affected me at all because they're easily covered and not too big or noticeable. I teach, and I remember one of my students telling me that the first time she saw me, she thought I was  bikie chick because I was wearing a "short skirt" and I had a tattoo haha, I thought that was hilarious. <br>  <br>  My eldest child (15yo daughter) has wanted one since she was 14, I said I would think about it when she turns 16 this year. She dragged me into a tattoo shop and they said that she had to be at least 16 and have parental consent. So as long as it's something and somewhere discreet (such as her lower back) once she turns 16 i'll let her get one if it's what she really wants.<br>  :)|`|sRy2SKpXaa	I have 2 tattoos and plan on getting at least one or two more. My husband also has one, and plans on getting more. Both of my parents have multiple tattoos as well. And no, it doesn't affect my life as a parent whatsoever. It's not like it's right on my forehead or something like that, they are on my back and my husbands is on his arm. And if my child came home with a tattoo, I can't honestly say what I would do. It depends on the age first of all. Secondly, tattoos are on you for life (unless you get them removed or whatever which is painful and expensive) so if you plan on getting one, it better be something you want to live with when you're 65 or older. I would probably be mad if my son (or sons) did it, you have to put a lot of thought into getting it, where at on your body, what shop, etc.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	My husband does, he got our daughter's name tattooed on his upper arm.  <br>  <br>  An older child, well as long as it's the kind that can be covered and not on the face or something I don't suppose I could be too angry.|`|AA10441869	It was our child who came home with one and as a result we have several in addition to a family crest we all have. So guess I wouldn't care as long as it's a nice one and created with thought and feeling.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I have 8 and in no way have I ever been judged or ridiculed, well atleast not that I am aware of.  <br>  <br>  I plan on letting my teenagers 18 and up get one of they'd like.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Both my parents have tattoos.  I don't think it effects their lives as parents at all.  They're still awesome.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	One of my parents a number of them, though all on his back or chest where they can be covered. <br>  <br>  I have two myself: one of two snakes (a green one and a grey one intertwined) and one of a wolf in the traditional Salish (a tribe of the Pacific Northwest) design. Both discreet, the only time anyone can see them is if I'm wearing a bathing suit. My husband has one of his family crest.<br>  It's never hurt any of us, no effect really.<br>  <br>  Older child... if they're over 18, a-okay. If not, they'd be grounded and I'd be very upset with them.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i have 3 and my husband has 3. i never really though about this but i cant tell him not too i like them.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I dont have one cause I am terrified of needles. My husband has one. And my daughters father has my daughter name. Doesn't really effect them at all I think. <br>  Erm. I don't know how I would react to be truthful. If she insisted on getting one, I would rather it be something meaningful to her, like my husbands one has special meaning to him, and her fathers one, obviously has special meaning to him. I wouldn't want her to get one just for the sake of it|`|55IMnlcwaa	I have 2 {one small wrist one, one large back one} and plan on getting many more. My husband has 4.<br>  <br>  I dont notice they affect my life - I also have my nose and tongue pierced and if anyone is giving me looks I dont know what it is at this point, tattoo, piercings, interracial marriage - I really dont care lol<br>  <br>  My kids, I would hope they get none until they are over 21 - so they are a bit more mature and sure they want to permanently scar themselves.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Nope, no tattoos here. I've just never had a desire for one and don't like needles anyways.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how I would react if my older child came home with a tattoo. I would probably flip, but where it was at and what it was would probably play a big role. If it was a face tattoo or something vulgar or obscene in a questionable place I would not be very happy.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	My husband and I both have them, and plan on getting another one in 2 weeks (we get them together).<br>  Why would a mark on my body effect my parenting? My scars don't change my parenting, a bruise or a scrap doesn't change anything.<br>  If my child, over 18 years old, came home with one, I would be fine. I would probably even want to go with them when they got it done, my mother came with me when I got my first.|`|lWUknox6aa	I have 4 tattoos, including my daughters name on my wrist..my husband has 3 tattoos.  I would prefer my daughter to not get any herself but its her choice.  I do however regret getting 2 out of my 4 tattoos.  I would make sure she realizes it is permanent and things you think are cool now, might not seem cool down the road.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I have one. It hasn't effected my life as a parent at all. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be happy if my daughter came home with one if she was under the age of 18. I didn't get mine until after I was 18, it didn't hurt me to wait and it wont hurt her either.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I have one and my step daughter loves it, my son is too young to notice it... but if they came home one day I wouldn't mind.  I will raise them to make tasteful choices in life, and not come home with some huge crazy tattoo all over their body.|`|1ERDjrTTaa	I have 1, but I would like to get a few more. My son was about 6 when I got it and when I took the bandage off he was a little grossed out by the blood. So I don't think he will be getting one. It has not effect on my life of a parent at all. Maybe a few dirty looks from some more conservative moms, but that does not bother me. Its a flower, so I have had a few younger kids ask me if I had to water it. LOL. If they are 18, I wont mind if they get a tattoo at all, anything younger then that I might be a little upset, but it would all depend on the circumstances and what kind and where. I did not get mine until I was 26 so there is no harm in waiting.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	Me and My husband both have three tattoos each but all are covered by clothing and only shown at our discretion. My young children know of them and we have explained that when they become legal adults they can make the decision of their own if they want tattoos or not, and we mentioned that they are permanent and a life long choice!  As for it effecting my life as a parent, it most certainly does not!|`|4gqeQB1naa	yes <br>  Only when i tried to get Meds for my back when i was younger my sister who don't have any tattoos could go and get anything and i who could prove my back problem couldn't get anything and if i did only once then the doctor would tell me that he couldn't give me any more<br>  My kids do have one but they suck they are what i call Jail house tattoos they are not art i got tattoos for the art. To just put you kids name in big letters i think sucks if its not done like art.<br>  i was very unhappy to see that they just went to get anything. I also don't believe you should get tattoos that you cant hide you have to get jobs and people don't want to hire anyone with tattoos. So be careful were you put them. one of my kids put it on her neck and the other one put it on her wrist. both places i would never put them.<br>  I gave them a speech and all i could do is let it go. Its there life.<br>  It never effected my life as a parent. if it did it was because my kids felt more free to get one and they made sure to put it some were i always told them not to (kid love to do anything there parents don't like)|`|xQ1F6Qmsaa	tattoos are art to some people so it is an individual choice... it doesn't affect me a  parent, that is a different role in life<br>  but, would be great if kids will seek advice first to parents before they have one,because special care has to be considered.<br>  putting a boyfriend/girlfriend initials are crucial mistakes.<br>  as for a child coming home with one, its a personal choice.|`|apALY0sqaa	I have two, as does the hubs- and we both want more. It doesn't affect our parenting at all- though we do have a curious 4 year old! My husband's are fairly visible- chest and upper torso, and mine are on my lower back and in my bikini area (can't see in a bathing suit though). My daughter knows both mine exist and she likes to see the butterfly on my back. As for the other one, she knows it exists thanks to trips to the bathroom for potty-training!<br>  <br>  I got my first tattoo when I was 16- my parents knew I was getting it in advance, and they were okay with it. the only rules were nothing classless and not on my face. The person who did it was a family friend, and he knew my parents' rules on it. If any of my kinds wanted one, I hope I have a good enough relationship with them that they could come to me BEFORE they did it. I have the same feelings my parents did on mine. I would just be worried about the place they got it- wanting to to be clean, and a good artist. They came home with a skull and cross-bones on their forehead, they are dead though!!!!|`|oAJi0s3Waa	i use to have a tattoo, but it is gone now, i have three sons all grown and with children of their own. my eldest son was in the navy and he came home with a tattoo.  i think it was cool  mine never effected my life one way or the other, my son is in college now and has been for two years and i do not believe it has effected his life at all|`|4t4S5kLkaa	yep got a star on right side of stomach n got about 6 stars on back with daughters name in the middle of them all, <br>  doesnt affect me at all, i do want one either on my hand inbetween wrist n thumb or side of my neck, <br>  but ive heard u can even b turned down for jobs if you have them here, which is a bit stupid to me as ive never been in trouble n dnt do drugs i just love the art of them n only have small simple ones
4JdeyxLZaa	That is good from what I know.  :)  If your cervix is soft, then you are getting ready.  If your cervix was hard and closed, then your labor/delivery could be farther off.<br>  <br>  Congratz!  :)|`|IA1irLy7aa	it means exactly that your cervix is soft during your whole pregnancy your cervix is usually hard then when you get closer to your due ate it gets softer and softer so it can dilate so the baby can come through.|`|095ad6b0873f57a356b83376e44f6309aa	a soft cervix means that your cervix is thinning out in preparation for the birth. once your cervix is completely gone which the doctor will call totally effaced you should be completely dialated and delivering your baby.
k2heQRKFaa	its called jealousy  ignore it or try a site just for pregnant ladies   try babycenter they have lots of message boards regarding pregnancy labor birth breastfeeding etc....or ivillage.com|`|7Io72XtQaa	I completely agree. Some comments left are really uncalled for.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I agree with you, to a degree.<br>  <br>  Unfortunally, this forum is riddled with trolls, so a lot of the time, negative comments are left to those questions that people suspect are a load of rubbish.<br>  <br>  As far as genuine questions getting such negativity, it's just a nasty case of 'Supermomitis', where a mother thinks they are much better than someone else, because of age, or financial status etc, so they just look for any reason to pick on others, since they think their way of parenting is the only way.<br>  <br>  Honestly, general society is great to me.<br>  It's this site that makes me feel the worst about myself.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Yes some people are rude but it also has to do with all those "Am I pregnant Q" we are not a a magic 8 ball how hard is it to buy a pregnancy test So I choose to ignore the dumb Q but some times I just can't help it(I get a lot of thumbs down) but that is what you will get when you come and ask for peoples opinion or advice you won't always get what you want to hear|`|plI0WOrUaa	I agree.  i think some people are just mean spirited and unhappy and can't help themselves or something.  It's not needed or called for, but i think some people really like to just stir the pot.  Or they are really young, i don't know.  I think people need to learn to respect others.|`|Kl5kN2Qaaa	i agree..some ppl have nufin betta to do than to critisize others..ppl come here for positive advise and not to b called names and b let down..those ppl who put others down shuld b banned and their ip recorded so they dont make another account|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I have never been so angry until I joined this site. I see way too much of this and it really upsets me. It doesn't matter if the question has been asked 1000 times, or if it is a question that people are against (abortion) It is really disappointing to see how immature people are. I will add my comment if I feel it's necessary. If I don't like the question or I think it's fake, I just simply don't respond. That is how easy it is.<br>  <br>   I am very sick of it too.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	If you don't have anything nice to say keep your mouth shut!!

AA11053404	As middle names are usually dropped - the parents of this poor little mite are planning to call him "Drew Peacock"? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Why do they hate him?|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	the jordan sounds well with peacock,id forget the drew it sounds like drew peacock(what else did u drew) only being honest.how about jordan shane peacock|`|wqbZbwpBaa	Not Drew Jordan. Jordan Drew ____ Peacock, because it would be Droopy Cock which is not something you want a child to have to put up with.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Drew Peacock said allowed sounds like: Droopy Cock.<br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  Andrew would be nicer.  With many the nickname Andy.|`|AA12343169	I prefer Jordan Drew, it has a better flow.|`|ZLTCPEpbaa	Ok I'm assuming (and I hope to all that's holy) that Peacock is the LAST NAME! :D|`|cn2rvsdOaa	No sorry!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	y do initials matter so much its not like ur ganna call him SJP ot DJP.|`|UquxJBwVaa	peacock? serisouly? <br>  drew jordon sounds kinda funny. <br>  i like samual jordan like x10 better.|`|fAN8snFdaa	I think Drew is Ok however to me persoanlly i see it more as a feminine name..<br>  <br>  Drew Ryan <br>  Drew Michael<br>  <br>  <br>  In the Uk kids arent teased about there names as much i dont think .. perhaps more in boys public schools..|`|QJf2XNaTaa	I like it! And even if Peacock was a chosen name, I'd like it!|`|Ss6MeyDYaa	yeah, Drew Peacock, just say it out loud!!!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	why Peacock?..... lmao<br>  i like Drew Jordan though|`|uFLZ4GOLaa	hell no, that kid would get laughed at  everyday|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	I wouldnt change the name based on sarah jessica parker...i didnt even know anyone called her those initials. I think that she should name him Andrew and call him Drew (since drew is short for andrew and it is usually just better to name them the long version so that they have options) Plus, whatever you decide to call your child is usually what they go by unless they hate it in which case it  is better to have options. I dont think Jordan goes well with drew but nobody really pays attention to middle names anyway lol. She could call him DJ though i guess. I dont hate the name, i just think there are better ones...|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	omg, noooooooooooooo way!!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Not really. Drew or Samuel Jordan,doesn't....flow well together. I think they are two first names put together,could be why it just doesn't fit. <br>  The initials are the least of her worries as of now.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I don't like the name Drew for a boy|`|S8Qpiabdaa	wow that kids gonna be made fun of FOREVER 'peacock???'|`|5sYzlAjPaa	yes - nice name
SEzIkGNiaa	Tips arn't a must for me, although I do appreciate it sometimes.  Maybe an extra 5 dollars here and there?|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Well, you pay by the hour. Why tip?<br>  Once the sitter is used to it and expects it it might be hard to stop.<br>  A tip is for extra trouble or service.
4iXL4C6paa	My oldest son is 6, my daughters are 2, and 3, and my youngest son is 6 months.  I got pregnant with my second daughter when my oldest was 6 months and I feel like that was good timing, they play so well together, they keep each other entertained, they learn so much from each other, they take up for each other, I am glad we decided to have them close together but it can get pretty stressful also so give yourself some time to really think it through and talk it out with your husband and make your decision then.  Good luck and congrats on your new baby.|`|RxY5mEflaa	I got pregnant with my daughter when my son was just about 1 and 1 month old.  It seems to me like it is SO MUCH harder, and the babies tend to imitate each other, which is harder when you are trying to get them to grow UP not spread out as babies :)|`|ubo0HWtVaa	oh you must be hormonal. and may be post partum. i have 3- i have a 4 yrd old, 22 mo, and a 6 mo old. <br>  it is great and yet very crazy, we love them but i definitely like the age difference between the first 2. it was hard to be pregnant for the past 2 years, its hard on your body. and i had great birthing expericences- my first was easy and only a few hrs- i am really blessed when it comes to pain tolerance- my 2nd was born in 5 mins of arriving at hospital. i don't even know who the dr was- it was whoever was in labor and delivery. 3rd was controlled chaos- my midwifes asked me @40th week- monday- i was dilated to 3, no contractions DO you want to have a baby today(i've never lasted that long) i think we are going to induce you so u don't have your baby in the car!! HAHAHA. iT CAN'T get any easier than that right- yes my last baby is beautiful, and is the best of all 3- in regards to sleeping, and crying... and other baby related issues. But the 2 yr old- had had to be the big sister when she was still a baby, and we have to treat her like the 22 mo old she is and make sure she is getting enough attention. It is defintely a challenge and love that my mom and husband and family are there to help me. Just keep in mind that your now 5 wk old baby is wanting her mommy to love and want her right now not thinking of another baby!!! and your 4 yr old needs to know that also!! take care and enjoy what you have and if you get pregnant again good luck! i say wait at least 2 yrs! oh 1 more thing can you afford another baby-( we don't need another octuplet mom)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I only have one 3 1/2 month old child, but I helped raise my cousin's kids who are 10 months apart. They're 8 and 9 now. Both boys and I love them more than I can express. Almost as much as I love my own daughter. They are close together so they're the best little friends. <br>  <br>  Now saying that, there are cons to this also. 2 babies in diapers, 2 babies to feed formula/breast milk to. 2 to potty train around the same time, ect. It's definitely harder when they're that close. BUT my main reason to wait would be that the body needs around 12 months to heal up enough to carry another baby. So I think you should wait at least 11 months to start ttc.<br>  <br>  This is of course a decision only you and your hubby can make. That's just my opinion and what I would do. I understand your feelings though. They are so adorable and innocent when they're first born, your hormones are raging, and you want another right away. Mine is 3 1/2 months and I still have this urge to get pregnant, but I think I'm going to enjoy a summer with a flat tummy and a bikini. : )
CdJtH0xdaa	I don't believe so, no|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	They won't find what they're not looking for. Tell her not to worry!!|`|r0ISrLc1aa	if shes only done it twice it will stay in her system for a maximum of 10 days.<br>  <br>  it will most likely not show up in a blood test for mono, they usually have to specifically test for it.<br>  <br>  just in caseee, the chemical that shows up in blood tests can be covered if you she drinks a lot of cranberry juice. like A LOT. dont stop drinking it! lol|`|9zwSclnLaa	Marijuana can stay in your body up to 6 months I hear, I don't know if that's urine or blood but blood would be the more sensible answer.  They aren't going to be looking for the THC so I doubt that it will show up.  A blood test looking for THC definetely would show it, but I hope she knows that much :)|`|Z4B93N31aa	probably not sure though<br>  haha that sucks and what are you 13 year olds smoking maryjane for ?<br>  <br>  hahha :D|`|AA11537580	they would be testing for MONO not drugs.<br>  they won't even test for that.|`|p3d3E75oaa	maybe|`|Rx31LHjbaa	They would have to specifically be testing for THC to find it.  It is not common whatsoever for a doctor's office to do routine drug screens.  Sometimes when people go into the hospital for things like psychiatric conditions they may do drug screens, but other than that, it is highly unlikely.  Doctor's offices just don't waste the money unless they need to know whether or not you are using drugs.|`|RmQ2czo8aa	probably not <br>  they are only checking for mono<br>  they arent technically allowed to say anything if they find anything<br>  its like patient doctor confidentiality<br>  dont worry i had pot in my system and it didnt show up when i got tested for mono (which i had blechhhh)|`|f6y3pM4oaa	I doubt it because my friend was a heavy user of marijuana and he used to get tested once a year with his mom and nothing happened to him|`|RBOc42Koaa	no,<br>  just like they can't tell if she has aids or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  you have to test the specific thing<br>  <br>  <br>  also, it takes about 2-3 months to get out of your system|`|d7kGopYxaa	well... they might  just look for mono but some other results come up as well?? Never do marijuana, and you will not be in the same position as her.|`|AtTxzYXbaa	Nope. They won't even be looking for Marijuana.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	yes!<br>  happened to me.|`|EyP4d90Paa	Marijuana will only show up if that is specifically what is being tested for. If the doctor suspects mono he will only test for mono. He may also do a blood count but the only way to detect drugs (marijuana) is to test for it. As long as the doctor or her parents have no reason to test then it won't be tested for.|`|RxY5mEflaa	if they do not specifically run the test looking for THC, it won't be an issue...which if she has mono they won't be looking for THC|`|ixy3memMaa	It wont, it didn't show up on mine. Its not even the same kind of of test so it wont matter.|`|iFTevsznaa	no

I'm confused.|`|D4eFh7Qlaa	what?
EH6ExoV6aa	yes you can take extra strength tylenol (it is made with ibuprofen). just no advil or aspirin because they thin your blood.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Cramps for what?<br>  Tylenol is fine, but you should talk to your doctor.<br>  Too much is bad.<br>  Too much of anything is bad.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can take Tylenol safely in pregnancy. It's really the only thing you can take. No asprin.|`|bu2BPue7aa	I am assuming you mean tylenol, if that is what you meant why are you drinkin it I thought liquid was for children.  Anyway tylenol is safe during pregnancy.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yes tylenol is fine during pregnancy, but stay away from advil, aspirin, motrin, etc.<br>  <br>  EDIT: yes...you CAN have extra strength tylenol|`|Eqln1jmNaa	yes you can have tylenol... and yes you can have extra strength, my doctor said just don't go over 500 mg in 6 hours... so extra strength is fine... I've been taking it since I first found out i was pregnant|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	yes you can take tylenol|`|OFN6irxeaa	yes, tylonal only unless something is given to you by your doctor I have to kids and my wife took tylenol during both pregnancies|`|Q1I4PhO1aa	yes you can take tylenol..but id check with your doc anyways..not like it would take long and nothing is more important than your baby :)|`|5K0eYC35aa	yes...you CAN have extra strength tylenol|`|FNdsPNrJaa	You should call your doctor. Only he can tell you whats good for you and whats not. :)|`|FIOOKpz0aa	Why would you drink it?
96HWpdkFaa	I'd wait to take the pregnancy test till your off your UTI medication.<br>  <br>  wait a week take another one...if it comes out negative and your still worried you can get a blood test. <br>  <br>  No one can tell you on here if your pregnant or not...all we can say, is what you pretty much know..and that's to test.|`|FEStjFIRaa	take a not that cheap one!!!
mPhsJ6Fjaa	my step daughters name is anna rose. and i also love the name alyssa, i dont know any kids that have that name, just a couple of friends my age that have it. but i love the girl name it is very cute!|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I like the name Alyssa also, but it is very very popular.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You want to give your kid three names,besides a last name? Oye. Nothing wrong with the names themselves,but there's just too many of them.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	Im not crazy about the first name, but i like Ann Rose =]
JnLoHaoAaa	As a society I think it's been drilled into parents' heads that we should pay for college, but I don't really feel that way. Yes, it's nice to contribute, but to pay for $30,000 a year (or will be that way in 10-18 years) for 4 years when you are still paying a mortgage is crazy. I once read that while setting aside money in a college fund is good, put more into your own savings. The reason is that your child is still young and can take out loans and work to pay for college. As an aging middle-aged person you are nearing retirement and need all the money you can get because you can't work while you're 85 trying to pay your bills. It makes sense. I would LOVE to pay for my child's college education, but like many other Americans it's just not financially possible.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No, I feel no obligation to pay for it, nor can I afford to.  I know a lot of people scrimp and save from the time thier children are born to pay for their college, but they should be putting that money into their own retirement and general savings for things that come up.  <br>  <br>  People need to find thier own means to pay for their education, it will mean more and it teaches them to persevere and work hard and that they are responsible for their own way in life.  <br>  <br>  Of course if a family is very very well off and paying for their childrens education is easily acheived then I guess they should pay, but I'd still rather them leave it to their kids to find a way to pay for it...through working and student loans.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Erm. I think you should help out your child. College is expensive. And I do not think it is fair to cripple young students with loans. I mean they have hardly any money as it is.<br>  If you can afford to help out then I think you should.<br>  People say it is up to the child, but really I think it is hypocritical to push your child through the normal school system and then when they get to college just be like, meh, your old enough  pay for it yourself.<br>  Of course, if your child can afford to help to, then by all means, they should. But I still think parents if they can afford it should help to.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	I don't really think that it is a parents responsibility to pay for college.  They are adults at that point.  I had to pay for my own college and I was glad that I had to.  I worked harder to get good grades because I didn't want to waste my money.  My parents paid for my sister to go and she dropped out after a year.  <br>  <br>  I am saving some money right now for my daughter's college and I will hopefully be able to help her out once the time comes.  I will let her live at home if she wants so she doesn't have to pay for rent, food, etc.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I don't feel obligated but it's something I think is important.  I never want my children to feel discouraged when it comes to college. I don't want money to be their concern at that point.  They will have so many years where they'll have to be worrying about and dealing with money.  I want to help them as much as I possibly can when it comes to college.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	My father paid for most of my school when I went, before I dropped out. He only did so because he had money. I dont plan on paying for my childrens college, but am supplying them with an education fund. I put $25 a month into it. If they decide to not go to school, then me and my husband are going to keep it.|`|FUOLr64jaa	My parents paid for my bachelor's degree, with the exception of $1000 and I gladly paid that when I got a good job and could afford it.  I haven't been diligent in saving for my son's education so far, but I would like to be able to pay for his education.|`|um29wkUPaa	My stepson is the dream college student. The kind of kid where I know I'm going to get a return on that dollar, you know?  Motivated, applied, and if this isn't expensive enough we've got med school after that.  <br>  <br>  I always said no: Your college, your debt.  But now that I'm walking that mile it's different.  I do feel obligated.  At the same time, Mr. Mozz and I live week to week like everyone else, and have my own list of debt.  We had a talk a long time ago, that Dad and I will help where we can, but you need to keep your name clean and get student loans.  We added that as part of the deal - you have to apply for SEVERAL scholarships EVERY semester (shows motivation, family assistance, appreciation, discipline, value of a dollar - I could go on and on.)  He also has to maintain his GPA and remain employed between breakout sessions.  We pay for his books, fees, and I have a benefit from where I work.  I also took over his cell phone bill.  The loan captures the rest of the tuition, his meal plan and housing.  He pays for his car/luxuries, his laptop/supplies, and school supplies.<br>  <br>  I also have a stepdaughter who does nothing to apply herself in college, as evidenced in her high school grades, attendance, party life and now a police record.  With her, we took it to court.  We're not cheapskates or bad people.  As I said, it's a pleasure to pay for my son's college.  With her I'll get no return on that dollar, it's being blown away.|`|mane2r23aa	"Experts" in finance and money feel that you should save for your own retirement before you save for your child's education because they can get a scholarship, grants, loans, etc. Our future needs will be here before theirs. I have opened a 529 college fund for my grandson (I skipped kids) because my parents told me they would cover 2 yrs of college, but it fell thru due to unemployment and layoffs of my father. So college didn't happen and even though they were unemployed they made too much on their last return so I couldn't get aid and no one would do a loan for me at that time. I have unresolved feelings because I wanted to go so badly then life happened so I want to make sure my grandson can go to college if he wants and if he doesn't, the money converts to a Roth IRA for me.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I am happy to pay for college tuition, because I'd rather them be able to concentrate fully on school without having to work a full time job.<br>  But if they want to help pay for it that's fantastic. My 15yo has a part time job and she puts money away to contribute to her college tuition, and I'll hope all my kids have the intuitive and maturity to do the same.<br>  Even if you just put away $5 a week, that will be a lot of money by the time your daughter is 18. It could help her out with college, or a car or a deposit on a house!<br>  I think it's very admirable to put yourself through college-it takes a lot of hard work. But as long as my kids are prepared to work hard, love what they are doing, and hopefully work part time then I'm prepared to pay for college. <br>  :)|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	You know, I'm glad you brought this up! I don't know why parents today are like 'omg I have to pay for my kid's college fund, what will I do???'. My parents didn't pay for my college - I went and got a student loan, graduated, got a job, and am now paying my student loan off. I never expected my parents to pay for my college education! I mean, by the time you're in college, you're an adult - time to start taking care of yourself.|`|ohyRPg1Uaa	wow! this crossed my mind a time or two. well, i had to pay for my college expenses by takin out loans 4 myself.. i feel like it's unfair for the child to have to develop bad credit fresh out of high school... i think if the parents aren't fincailly able to pay for their childrens college. the least they could do is take out loans for their children. another, thing i believe that it would be a great idea if you start saving for your childs education for the simple fact that the expenses for college for the next 18 years is increasing at a dramatic rate! good luck!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	If you have the money, and will be able to take care of yourself without the money, then it's nice for parents to contribute to their child's education. But if you don't have the money to, then you shouldn't feel guilty about not being able to pay for it.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I don't feel obligated at all to pay our children's way through college.  <br>  <br>  We have to think about our own life savings before we can go broke on trying to pay $20+K a year for college (twice!).  We will give our kids a roof over their head and food to eat, but otherwise they'd better get the grades!  It's either scholarships, grants or student loans for them.  We just can't afford to put them through college, even if we started saving now.<br>  <br>  My parents paid for my college and for my siblings, but they had the inheritance from my dad's parents passing away.  That's the only reason they were able to pay for our college education.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I feel that it is my responsiblity as a parent to make sure that my children recieve the education they need to fulfill their requirements for whatever career they choose.  Whether that be beauty school, juco, or a four year college, I will leave up to them.  If the situation so happens that I cannot afford that at the time, then I will certainly help them to the best of my ability, including helping them pay back whatever loans they may have to take out.  I have started my oldest son's savings account already, and I intend to start my other two children's accounts within the next couple of months.  They are 5, 6, and 8.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I don't think a parent is obligated to pay for the child's college.  I think it is a wonderful thing to do if a parent can afford it.  I also think it's nice to help out.  There is no way we will be able to pay for two college educations, so what we are doing is putting away money here and there for the boys.  We hope they will get jobs when they are old enough and will save money for themselves.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i think it is.  but i guess i think that because my parents paid for my education.    If i ever have children,  I will pay for their education.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I'm with you. My parents helped when they could but for the most part it has been up to me to pay for and the same will go for my son.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I feel that it is...or to at least do as much as we possibly can. I feel it is one of the final responsibilities as a parent to a child
vLOjcH7paa	My son (now 21 weeks old) LOVES reaching and trying to grab things with his little tosies (and hands too)! It's too cute! We just love his little monkey toes...if you're concerned, just ck with the pediatrician. But, I would suspect she's just learning and developing! : )|`|elk3AnNXaa	Yeah.<br>  I would say so.<br>  But only because that's what I did.<br>  I'm completely normal and healthy now, the doctors just told my mom I was "expirimentig other things" i thaught my feet were my hands. Your baby should eventually grow out of it. plus playing with your feet is fun when your a baby! <br>  ahahaha.<br>  Don't sweat it, it's a stage<br>  <br>  hope that helps<3|`|5rcVJByHaa	My 3 month old is doing the same thing. I wouldn't worry but go ahead and bring it up with your pediatrician to put your mind at ease.|`|nmu6coapaa	I wouldn't worry, she's probably just found her feet before her hands! My 3 month old son stared at his feet for about 10 mins this morning!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Hmm... That is interesting I haven't experienced this as my son has always reached with his hands, i am sure your daughter will eventually use her hands to grab things at this age they are also fascinated with there toes and feet anyways hun.
irHF6CBPaa	Always use protection no matter were it protects you against pregnancy and STDs Oh What does this have to do with pregnancy?|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Yes you can.<br>  <br>  Will it work - Same chance as always - most likely but not always.<br>  <br>  godbless x|`|QSodlfMraa	i think it should.|`|OWDspwDUaa	Ya you can. Sometimes it can get a little dry because of the water but if your wet enough you should be good|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	LOL,ironically you posted this in pregnancy. So... <br>  Anyway. It should be fine. If the condom fits him properly and there are no holes in it.|`|DWeGV8Akaa	itll work|`|Po2UqfvWaa	or course, it is the ultimate rain coat.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Yes you can and yes it works lol.<br>  <br>  However, condoms don't work all the time, no matter where you use it.  Best to be on the pill and using condoms.<br>  <br>  PS.  Why is this in the pregnancy section?|`|dc628c84ed9b9f2f5bfb75b116f5d31caa	yes you can and yes it may work|`|wBn4JZvQaa	I don't see why not it's latex after all (a type of rubber that some people get skin allergy's from)|`|u93oneUXaa	yes you can - and yes it does.|`|GqTSa85daa	Been there, done that|`|zS6s7CrDaa	idk DD :|`|2UNBPcxTaa	yes.and it will work.|`|pCS0d1axaa	Yes you can and it will work but running water may wash away the lubricant and sex could be a little painful and can cause burning sensation if you are not properly lubricated so keep a tube of tube of lube handy just in case.|`|eJvlZZeNaa	i remember reading in a magazine that it is impossible to get pregnant in a pool or hot tub but idk about a shower.<br>  <br>  xoxo, Emily|`|7oiBFIguaa	Yes you can use a condom in the shower, yes it will work. And dont think because your in the shower means you wont get pregnant you can.|`|ANsznbWsaa	It will be difficult cause the water washes away a lot of the lube anyway. You could try but I'd think it would be easier for it to break, and a lot more difficult for the actual act|`|TMuxrQfdaa	Works for me all the damn time don't know why it wouldn't for you. Make sure you know how to put one on proper. I had to practice to get it right. Have Fun|`|snzfXpVgaa	YEAH<br>  it  is ahhmmaaazing,<br>  wow<br>  i accaully tried it last night,<br>  it feels so good<br>  no lubee|`|6ffd4feb2e23eaa6f5d5f78d385bd968aa	Yes it does and it's so much fuuuuunnnn!!!!!<br>  ENJOY!!!!<br>  P.S. make sure its the right size condom.lol|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Yes it does work I asked my sister in law whos a fetal suron that means shes a woman care doctor for that type of stuff|`|Q1I4PhO1aa	yes you can :) have fun!|`|AA11197832	Yeah it'll work.  Might be a lil more slippery though...|`|Xg9tvcOJaa	it might slip off or if you don't then happyness|`|EVs8bXEtaa	just put the condom on then rap tape around the base if you're unsure. lol
aJLx0nhNaa	I'd want more information about why there was undigested formula powder in his poop.  My son eats powder formula and I have never seen that.<br>  <br>  But I would also give it a day or two.  The poop changes so much from day to day.|`|vn3DGMw0aa	Dont worry, thats quite normal. My baby had that happen to, we also had a chart from the health unit to show us how many and what colour his poop would be, maybe you should get one to. Hope all is well.
irHF6CBPaa	Sorry for being a little rude but how do you know he is not having and affair he is away all week and he told this women he loves her I think you want to believe he did not cheat The reason you don't care maybe because you don't love him anymore if my husband did this to me I would be so hurt pregnant or not pregnant I guess every one is different Good Luck in your marriage|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm going through something with my husband right now too...it's been happening for awhile I thought it stopped I just found out it didn't (not cheating on me) I'm 10 weeks and 4 days pregnant...and I feel the same..it's like I hardly care anymore cause I'm so happy and I feel so much love for this baby that he's not effecting me as much. Although deep down I know I need to take charge or our relationship will suffer.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Your a woman....throw the BASTARD out and get a divorce.|`|sSRHQkROaa	i think you don't care because you are only concerned about your unborn child.<br>  i also think that you should care because if his relationship with this woman is only a close friendship it shouldn't have been hidden.|`|x0bJmyDPaa	How do you know they haven't slept together?  Because he told you so???  They've said they love each other - he's stayed over at her place without saying a word about it to you - of course they're sleeping together!!|`|000cec0ed22ec167c9a8cf98303156dcaa	It's not wrong for your husband to have a female friend, someone who he can rely on when he can't rely on you because he doesn't want to stress you out. I would make sure his love for this other woman was completely different than the love he has for you. If it's more of a sister, brother friendship then you're right, I wouldn't worry. All you really need from him is his honesty and trust and make sure he doesn't complain when you find another man to confide in. I am glad you are more focused on the baby, but if he really loves you, why hasn't he been honest from the start? And if you really share your lives together why wouldn't he want to tell you everything? His indiscretions should only be important when it comes to that baby. He is a married man and should be having unsupervised visits with another woman behind your back regardless of the circumstances and regardless of if you trust him. He's married. I have a guy friend who is pregnant and I love him like my brother. I have a 14 month old and out of respect for my husband, this other man and his pregnant girlfriend, me and my daughter, I would never invite him over to sleep on my couch regardless. This woman should have better knowledge of this issue as well. She shouldn't be letting a married man stay over at her house. I know you don't need to be worried and you're pregnant. Your hormones are a little off. Eventually you will be mad about the situation. I know I would be. But nothing is wrong with you. I hope things work out for you and congrats on the pregnancy!|`|s2JBY0ewaa	throw the asshole out. Why would he feel the need to hide a friendship if nothing was going on? the whole trust thing went down the drain the minute he lied about another woman. if i was you id kick him out and teach him a lesson|`|zlciavc1aa	Nothing wrong with you.. if anything it's good you feel that way, the less stress for you the healthier the baby.. I'm glad you're focusing more on the pregnancy|`|3vh7h6iYaa	The exact same thing happened to me, and I was hysterical at first, but after he broke off the friendship with the other girl it was almost like it never happened.  I just couldn't stay mad, because it was just not worth it.  Everyone thought I should get divorced, but I'm so glad I didn't!  Our marriage is even better now that we have lived through that kind of situation.  It's weird how our emotions work sometimes, but I think you should go with your gut, don't force yourself to be mad just because that's what our society says you should feel.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	Nothing is wrong with you hun! and you probably don't care because you are too excited and all emotional about your pregnancy..and to me, it sounds like you should leave him..even though he may not have cheated on you, how long would it have been before he did? I mean c'mon..he was telling this other woman he loved her and was keeping his "friendship" with her a secret...that's not normal..I recently left my boyfriend because we had some issues and im 31 weeks pregnant..its hard but you have to think about your baby..counseling might do him some good though!!!  well good luck with everything hun and i hope all turns out well for you!!!|`|HjPPj4Kzaa	maybe your not too upset because you have fallen out of love with him and you only got mad because he made a fool out of you trying to hide this with you. cheating on someone is not only having sex with someone else. if he has fallen in love with someone else then thats worse then some fling with someone he doesnt care about. i think you should leave him because an inhealthy marriage is worse for a child then having two parents and its better now that the babay isnt born yet then having to put the child through it when he or she can remember|`|Q1I4PhO1aa	theres nothing wrong with you. I mean think about it what is there to really be upset about? your both young and the main thing in what you said is "their friendship" do you have guy friends? and if so does he know every single one of them? and think do you love any of them? I think the fact that you are pregnant is making you hormonal and your over thinking the whole situation. I mean there FRIENDS and your having his child..he said he loves her..who does he really love? think about everything. <br>  congratulations and good luck :)
OCk7I8JVaa	For me, it was a little worse than the usual HSG because my uterus kept spasming to push the dye out, causing the balloon to deflate. As a result, they had to inject the dye 4 times and eventually gave up. The second time I went in, they used a different procedure which did not involve a balloon and this was much more successul.<br>  If you can handle menstrual cramps, you can handle this procedure. It feels like a strong menstrual cramp right when they inject the dye but it only lasts a few seconds and you definitely feel relief after the dye makes its way out of the tubes. <br>  My tubes were clear though but I have heard that the experience can be more painful when the tubes are blocked.<br>  One thing I would suggest, that I opted for the second time was valium. I only took one but I should have taken 2. Take it about an hour before your procedure (do not combine with grapefruit juice). It is a muscle relaxer and will help prevent cramping/ spasming. Ask for pregnancy safe antibiotics before and after the procedure to reduce the risk of infection.<br>  Good luck! And don't worry. I was so afraid after reading the horror stories but it really wasn't that bad, even after my experience.|`|CBFEYHwDaa	Hi<br>  <br>  My experience was moderate cramps (like menstral cramps).  The cramping lasted about 4 hours and then I was fine.  I did take advil before the a|`|PQw92IGHaa	My mom performs HSG on patients and she said she has never had anyone that said it was too painful to handle.  She said mainly just uncomfortable with someone being down there and mild cramping when they inject the dye.  I have also had several friends tell me the same thing.  I have one scheduled fro Monday too, so I hope they are right!  Good Luck!|`|Faw2iBtfaa	My RE said that it is markedly less painful for women who have given birth, the reason being that there cervix has already opened before.  I had very little pain, but I have given birth before.  There is not much to it, the only part I found to be a little uncomfortable was when they finished injecting the dye.  It was momentary and all in all not that bad.  I was also told to take 4 ibuprofen before the procedure.  Try not too worry about it too much, I bet it won't be as bad as you are thinking it will be.  I wish you luck!
BBfIXcI0aa	You should never have to give up a friendship to maintain a dating relationship. If that turns out to be the case, then it's the relationship that needs to go - most dating relationships at this age end sooner or later, but you can be making friendships that will last a lifetime.<br>  <br>  If your guy friend likes you, he likes you - that's part of the complications of inter-gender friendships. Being your friend, though, I would guess that he's tactful enough to suffer in silence rather than make a move. As long as you can deal with the knowledge that he loves you and you don't love him, the friendship will be just fine.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend has no right to say who you can or can't hang out with - he needs to learn to trust you. You wouldn't flip out if he went out for coffee or something with a female friend, would you? (If you would, then you don't have any room to complain about anything.)|`|WGAFP6mSaa	Well, he IS your boyfriend, you expect him not to be jealous? Most guys get jealous when they see their girlfriend hanging out with another guy.<br>  <br>  Nevermind that, that sounded rude, sorry. But really, if your boyfriend really loves/likes you, he needs to learn to trust.<br>  <br>  You could try hooking up your guy friend with one of your friends. Because once your guy friend has a girlfriend, he'll be paying a little less attention to you and more on his girlfriend, therefore, making your boyfriend not jealous..I think, right? Once your guy friend has a girlfriend, you can go on a double date. You'll still be hanging out with your guy friend and his girlfriend [your friend], along with your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!|`|I64JOuMKaa	aw this happened to me too ..<br>  thats the problem with having bestfriends as guys ):<br>  <br>  what I did was tell my boyfriend that if he really loved me .. he should trust me cause I would never do anything to hurt him .<br>  <br>  my boyfriend decided to trust me , but it was a huge mess in the end .. and it just ended<br>  relationships dont work if there is not trust so try to let him trust you .|`|QM6wiVtVaa	How would you feel if his best friend was a girl, who really liked him.<br>  He's probably just worried about your friend trying something. Give him a break, unless he starts being possessive and controlling and won't let you (or throws a fit when you do) see your friend.|`|FEStjFIRaa	watever if your boyfriend tells you to stop talking to him dnt do that!!! that kinda happend and i cnt talk to my guy friends in the fone bcus he be chekin me!!!!|`|52E9NR2Waa	i don't blame him....what if his very best friend were a girl?  It probably would make you very uncomfortable|`|dDHtziQEaa	your ******* retarded.<br>  <br>  you guy friend is in love with you<br>  your bf knows this<br>  choose between them<br>  if you choose your bf make sure to let your guy friend know that you do not have those sorts of feelings for him and try to still be friends|`|pgKr7aCBaa	Well whats he going to do about it?Thats if your friend likes you?
UFqacgoiaa	Good question- I think that Beia would be pretty, but you could also do Baya, Bayah, Beiah, Bayuh, or Beiya, Bella makes sense, since but Bella pronounced bell-uh is so common I think that an alternate would be better.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	Baia|`|KImktMtXaa	Baya, or Baia, or Beya, yea|`|d1ze4HWpaa	Bea, with an accent over the "e."<br>  <br>  =]|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	It is spelled Bella because in spanish the 2 L's together are pronounced "y". It would be mispronounced plenty though. I guess Beya or Baya...maybe add an H at the end if you want. Bayah? I dont think it is very pretty to be honest :(|`|AA11053404	To cut out any problems in the future you could just spell it Baya.<br>  <br>  Baia looks far more intriguing - but suggests the pronunciation By-a.<br>  <br>  Unless you want it pronounced By -a... in which case I would spell it Baia.|`|m4amCT5waa	Oh!  Are you talking about Bela?  (Makes me think of Bartok.)<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, no, you're probably not.  For some reason I imagined that there was an 'l' in your pronunciation, too, not just in the spelling you'd seen.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	There's a girl on the current Real World cast with a name pronounced as you have it written above, and she spells it just as you've sounded it out: Baya.|`|kZQ3NIbDaa	Bayah I think|`|1U3kSuhsaa	baiya is a good way to spell it

PKUPgmnwaa	I personally think the answer is rather simple - in the way that we were matched with our son.  His mother didn't contact the agency until after he was born.  (There isn't any need to have an agency involved while you are pregnant.) At that point, they have specially designated foster families who care for the babies.  The mother doesn't have to relinquish her rights for this to happen.  She seems the baby as often as she wants, and has time to make the decision without the pressure of "you've got to do it now, you've got to pick the family."  Our son was in foster care for several weeks, at which point she decided to go ahead with an adoption, and it wasn't until that point that she was shown profiles to be matched with.  We had no idea any of this was going on, or that she had chosen us, until she had made her decision and it was time for placement.  We then had about 10 days notice before we met her, and our son, and brought him home.<br>  <br>  I think it works on a few levels.  They aren't being pressured in the hospital, they are able to have the birth experience they want, without an agency involved.  They have time to recover from the hormones, to see and hold and love on their baby.  They are able to see what it's actually like to go home and leave their baby.  There are no PAPs, with expectant smiles, promising them anything.<br>  <br>  Truthfully, I preferred it that way from my perspective, as well.  We weren't involved until she had made a decision.  In speaking with her after the fact, I do believe that she made the decision of her own free will, and am glad that we, that our "wants," weren't a factor in the least.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	People want change, but changing a culture so geared towards making money out of adoption is hard. Its a whole new mind set. And a government willing to admit there's something mot right in how adoption is currently (in the US) being conducted. <br>  <br>  I had two days to prepare a babies room (6 months old) and it didn't hurt us to have short notice, we were prepared to have to change things quickly. And in the long term our kid adjusted well to the transition process. (second time round, we at least had all the kids room stuff.) I looked into how a woman thinking about adoption would be treated when approaching social services after 2000. There have been massive changes in ten years even in the way they approach it. <br>  <br>  We met our eldest child's Nmother about a month after placement. So far we are all getting along, taking it slowly, (one visit at time, one letter at time,) giving it time to build trust rather than rushing to a social workers text book idea of openness in adoption. <br>  Potential adoptive parents are invited to attend the initial seminar for inter-country and local adoption. Its not our right to be an adoptive parent. (Even some Aussies don't get that...so they run off to America where its 'easier' to adopt children. )<br>  <br>  The approach that we have here does work, (Everyone is protected, and all children go into foster care first, even if she walks out of the hospital the day she gives birth saying she wants adoption, social services still give her time to think about it, they have nothing to gain from an adoption , they get paid if happens or not.) <br>  <br>  I guess that's my main point, why can't it work that way in a progressive country like the US? The day adoption goes back to being service within the community for children (no profits, proper treatment of women who are in difficult circumstances.) who need a home things will improve, until then it will stay the same...|`|Alyvp37Maa	Hi Erin,<br>  <br>  We had a similar experience as Wholelottacats.  No decisions were made until after the birth of our daughter.  After the hospital stay M. could either take the baby home with her or let her baby go to a "foster family" who just watches babies in this type situation.  M. was allowed to see her baby as often as she wanted and she was able to change her mind at any time.  We were not notified or involved at all until our daughter was 5 days old.  She stayed at the foster families house for 4 weeks until M. signed her parental rights away.  During those weeks we met with M. and got to know her as a person and learned M.'s hopes and dreams for her daughter.<br>  <br>  Looking back, I feel so fortunate that this was how our adoption was done.  If a domestic adoption has to happen, this is the way to do it.  I believe it helps eliminate coercion and gives the mother the opportunity to change her mind and walk away with her child at anytime.  Also wanted to add that the baby was placed with a family close to the mother and NOT the adoptive parents.  We were 2 hrs away and M. was 15 minutes away, as it should be.<br>  <br>  eh, but then again i might biased because this is my experience:)
5jLEtjYxaa	I think it's fair|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Sounds fair to me.  You still get to use the phone and internet, just on a restricted basis.  That's a lot of things to be getting low grades in.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Your education is really important and your parents just want to give you the best possible chances at success. There's not much you can do about it - so use these five weeks to study so you get a good report card and no further punishment.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Do you get to use the computer during the week for school or is that on weekends only? If that were me I would let you hang out with friends on the weekends after homework/studying is done. Everything else I agree with. Texting is a bad habit and it is really distracting when you are trying to get things done, esp. when you need to concentrate. Work hard and keep your grades up though and this won't be a problem anymore.|`|AA10620246	That sounds about right to me. Your parents took away things that get in the way of you studying and doing your homework. If you were my kid, I would have done pretty much the same thing.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think it is fair until your grades go up to an acceptable level.|`|YjfBHttWaa	I think it is an ok punishment because all of those things could distract you.|`|3UPwAxvUaa	yes sounds right to me that is what I would do, I would personally take your phone away all together  I know you are going to be mad but we were all in your position too, and yes it seems harsh right now but it will only help you in the long run|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I think it's fine.  All those things could prove to be a distraction so she's encouraging you to study.|`|M8V3HeVmaa	i wish i had your grades...im a C and D student....as long as i have mostly C's my parents are ok|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Sounds very reasonable to me, you need to make school come first.. I am sure you are capable of better grades than that|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Perfectly fair punishment for those sucky grades...thats really sad that they are going up and in subjects like ART...|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Sorry, but I agree with your moms punishment|`|EFBUPnITaa	hmmmm get better gradesss;]
43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Wait and see.  Also, start using condoms again.  It only takes one slipup with the pullout method to get you pregnant.  I know that from experience and have a beautiful son to show for it.  ;-)  Plus using a method you know is unreliable will make you stressed out and start seeing pregnant signs in everything.  It might be in your head, it might be signs your period is coming, it might be ovulation, or it could be pregnancy.  The only way to know for sure is to wait until you're late and then take a pregnancy test.|`|YjfBHttWaa	Take a test or go to a doctor if you are worried about it.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Pulled out hah. Thats how my ex got pregnant.  Dont ask us if your pregnant you need to take a test or go to a Dr. we dont know lol.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Take a test<br>  Its simple
kdSuwt8paa	I recommend a book called "Save our sleep" by Tizzie Hall.     She deals with feeding etc as well as sleep patterns and it is a brilliant book.   I think every baby should bring a copy under its arm!|`|deIzFnV8aa	Do it little by little, like stretching it 10 additional minutes every few days.  If he wants the feeding early, give him someting else to suck on. He may or may not happily accept that, but it is worth a try.  Comfort him in other ways if it doesn't work for the 10 minutes he is fussing.  If he consistently accepts the stretched time, stretch it a bit  again.<br>  <br>  Also encourage him to empty one breast so that he gets the more-filling hindmilk; that can help him last a bit longer.
EVs8bXEtaa	This isn't about the baby but about showing the parents that you care about their child.<br>  <br>  If you can, just get him a stuffed animal or something like that. something cute and bigger than he is!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	When my kid turned 1 i loved just getting gift certificates to places like Target, Baby's R us, so i could just get what i want.  Those bibs with funny sayings are also good.
PQw92IGHaa	My mom does HSG tests on people and she said that she has never seen anyone that had any issues with it hurting too much and I have had four friends tell me that the only pain the felt was mild cramping, the same as if they had menstrual cramps.   I'm having one done on Monday, so I hope they are right.<br>  <br>  If anything, I would take a couple of tylenol!  Good luck, I hope it is painless!!!|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	I just took a couple of pain advil and was fine. It was like a dull, warm cramp - not nearly as bad as period cramps! lol I think my nerves probably made it worse. What was bad was the cramps the next day - that was worse! So take more advil the next day as well! They told me no intercourse for a week. I had no problems after.
NDQS5HJyaa	Starting a routine and STICKING with it is probably your best bet, although its no guarentee that it'll make him sleep longer. Babies at that age are prone to waking up a lot, especially for night feeds. Like, start off every night reading a story, taking a bath, tucking in, turning all the lights off, maybe have a fan going on in the background... (My daughter always falls asleep to the noise of the fan, of course its not pointed in her direction or anything.) Something like that. It might take a few months, but eventually he'll fall into routine and start sleeping longer.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Every baby is different when it comes to sleeping through the night and some babies don't even sleep through the night until there older. You can't really encourage a baby to sleep longer than what they want too.|`|deIzFnV8aa	This is not that great a suggestion, but I have been using white noise to help extend naps, and I think I am going to start using it more for nighttime sleep, too. Nature sounds are particularly nice for this.<br>  <br>  And just to mention it, at this age babies usually need to eat once during the night, so it is natural for your baby to wake up once.  What you can try to cirumvent this is to "dream feed" them right before you go to bed - that is where you offer a feed while they are still pretty much asleep - the idea being that if they don't fully wake up they will go right back down. I have trouble getting DD to eat more than an ounce or two this way, but on nights when she _does_ get a good feed around 10 or 11, she usually makes it through to morning.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Mine used to sleep 10-12 hours a night. Now at almost 4 months, she started waking around 4 to eat, and then goes back to sleep for a few more hours. When you find out the magic "touch" to get them to sleep through the night...Let me know...
qYrrEVIMaa	unfortunately its not uncommon to want an abortion if the pregnancy is the result of a rape. try a crisis line or tell your doctor you need help. they might be able to turn u in the direction of a counselor or something like that. you may not even have to tell the doctor exactly what is wrong. most important thing is to talk to someone like that. maybe through a counselor you can get in touch with some other women who are in similar situations. and even though your only 13yrs old the baby in your belly is yours and yours alone. forget about the inhuman scum who put it there. let your instinct guide your decisions but remember that this is a VERY rough situation so your allowed to need help from others. YOUR UNCERTAINTY DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON. its actually mature of you to unsure about what to do. immaturity would be to make a split decision. maybe god saw in you and knew that you would be strong enough to handle this and that's why things happened the way they did. i believe good people get dealt the worst deck of cards because god knows we can handle it. get help. don't keep this to yourself...  may god grant you the questions your asking if you cannot find them yourself and may god grant you the strength to see how strong you already are. whatever this situation means one thing is clear. you are a special person and god must see a reason for this. i guess i am simply saying.. trust!|`|YRmgqMp3aa	Honestly, I don't know what to say because I am a teen mom and that's hard as it is. I have the support of my boyfriend and it's difficult because there's a lot of stress with school and social life and everything. I don't know what to do when rape is involved. You really have to think about how you feel about things and what you think is right. You should also talk to your parents about things and really just make a plan that you think will work for you and stick to it. I hope that things work out for you.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Giving your baby up for adoption doesn't make you a bad mother.<br>  And sure when the baby gets older and finds out that he/she was adopted they might resent you but you know that you were doing what's best for your baby. And in my opinion it's better to give your baby up for adoption know that he/she will be better off than to keep the baby and he/she has to grow up in an unstable enviroment.|`|mIxCaKI7aa	i know its going to be hard but god made u get rapped and he made u get pregnant from it on purpose and he never makes mistakes so i wouldnt abort it i would have it and either put it up for adoption or keep it....?|`|45425cbc5941e75d5b3fc9f76cc2311eaa	Well you seem to have a big problem...the best advice i can give to you is not abortion b/c that is very bad. I would make sure to talk to your mom and see what se says. even though she is not ur real mom. she will be able to help. <br>  <br>  You said u have not had ur period before and u got pregnant..well that's possible. you were probably about to get your period for the first time soon. isn't that cool. <br>  <br>  I would research about what others did. maybe they went through what you went through. just dont take away a life!|`|52E9NR2Waa	My heart goes out to you for having to deal with this....no one should ever have to go through this<br>  <br>  For only 13 years old you have great character and it's commendable.  The fact that you were given up for adoption was an act of love.  your mom knew that she wasn't equipped for whatever reason to take care of you, so she made the hard decision to put you in the care of someone who could provide those things for you.  The decision is yours, but no matter how a child is concieved, every human being should have a chance at life<br>  <br>  one thing that is true is that you would love this child and know that is not their fault, and if you decided to have it and gave it up he/she would be so grateful for that|`|8LP57QOCaa	I'm sorry you experienced such an awful thing it's not right and shouldn't happen. <br>  Have you seeked counselling? It's so important that you don't bottle things up inside particually about your experience.  do you have supportive parents and friends around you? I hope so. <br>  <br>  I know you don't particually agree with abortion and i think that's great if thats how you feel but i want you to remember that even though this child is half his the other half is you. Your dna is in this baby and your blood too, only you can make the right decision based on how you feel but I urge you to think about this. You may have your baby and automatically feel that connection as mother and child and you may also have it and want to raise it. But you could feel how you described. I have yet to hear of a mother hating her child but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If however you are sure you don't want to be a mother at this time in your life which you're entitled to say then i suggest discussing this with your adoptive parents. They will be able to help you reach a decision based on what you and feel and support you in goign about that. <br>  <br>  This isnt something people on here can give you an answer too, as we aren't affected by your decision only you and your baby are, im sure though there are plenty of mothers who raise their baby and love it just like anyother mother does, its really up to you. I wish you all the best in your decision an dhope you do whats right for you and the unborn baby.|`|JAZWe8A6aa	I'm so sorry to  hear about all of this, you really shouldn't have to go through this at only thirteen. I'm thirteen and had a similar issue, but I didn't get pregnant luckily. <br>  <br>  As far as not wanting an abortion, I think that's great. But having the baby would put you in a very difficult situation. It's good that the guy went to jail and won't be able to hurt you anymore, but if you don't want to be a mother yet then you're only other option is having the baby adopted. I know how you feel, I'm adopted as well and I never will know who my mother or father is or even if they're alive. I don't know why I was given up or anything, so that leaves me wondering. Anyways, try to have your parents help you figure out what to do. I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly difficult on you. Just remember that if you do decide to keep this baby, then every decision that you make after he/she is born will be influenced by your new son/daughter. <br>  <br>  As far as thinking that you won't love the baby because of the rape, I don't think that will be possible. If you've ever looked down at a baby I don't see how anybody couldn't love that baby. As the child grows older and begins to wonder who their father is, that will be difficult. But still, everything is your and your family's decision. Best of luck.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk, I think I could really be able to understand a lot of the things your going through. We're the same age and both adopted and wonder why we were given up. So if you're interested in talking, email me at 'elysehewitt1995@rocketmail.com' and I'd be glad to try and help you out.|`|c3ceb32dd6c608f212eeca7265260ee3aa	I don't think abortion is that harsh an issue here, actually.<br>  God did NOT intend for you to have this baby, as the sex that caused it wasn't between two people who were in love. <br>  And, having the baby at such a young age could make the baby have developmental, both physical and mental, problems. Most of the babies born to young mother's are premature, and often have slight mental challenges.<br>  Having a baby at your age will severely affect your health as well.<br>  The delivery itself will put your life at stake.<br>  Make your decision, but make the one that is right for u|`|wITZ6ltYaa	Oh my god. Follow your heart. If you feel like you won't be able to love it like you should because he/she will just remind you of the rape then don't have it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have the baby and put it up for adoption he/she will wonder all their life why you didn't want them..or if they know they're a rape baby they'll feel like it wasn't their fault and wouldn't be able to understand how it made you feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  You won't be doing the wrong thing for any decision you make. You're so young and you didn't want to have sex so it's not your fault.<br>  <br>  Do whatever feels right.<br>  <br>  <3|`|xFVjLpdYaa	OMG!!!<br>  Being against abortion is the right thing to do.<br>  Consider adoption.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	There are some times that good people get really screwed like you did.<br>  <br>  You seem smart enough to know your options.  The rest is up to you.|`|I64JOuMKaa	im so sorry <3 just know your not eer going to be alone in this.<br>  first , I would go up to your mom and tell her you haven't had your period ever since you got raped. Tell her you want to try a pregnancy test and that you want her to be there with you so you guys can do it together. If it is positive again, talk to your mommy. <br>  <br>  Your real mom didn't give you up because she didnt want you, she gave you up because she couldn't provide foryou and she wanted to give you the best life possible hun <3<br>  <br>  You can have the baby and your mom can help you raise it, or you could give it up for adoption and get it back when you're older to care for it <3<br>  <br>  best of luck !|`|JpmKtpqmaa	I am sorry about what happened to you and you can seek counseling just to let your feelings out...Being in therapy doesnt mean that you are crazy, it just means that you need someone who can listen and not judge...<br>  No its not bad that you dnt want to be a mom; your only 13 and then you were raped...but giving away this child, doesnt mean that you are abondoning it...it just means that you want him/her to have a good home..But if you and your mom want to take care of the baby and raise; thats good too, but just know that you are gonna have to work hard and your childhood is gone...But If you are not strong enough to look this child in his/her face everyday because of your rape, it is ok to give the baby up for adoption...Give the child to someone who wont resent him/her..Its better to give the child to someone who can love it without regret or shame..I am sorry for what happened to you...Hopefully it all gets better in time....Wishing you the best of luck!!!!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Ugh, that's horrible. I can only imagine what you're going through, sweetheart. You're making the right decision about not getting an abortion. If you set your baby up for adoption, it's not like you didn't want him/her, it's just you would want the baby to have a better life. Wouldn't you agree? You can even set up so that someone you know and someone you feel comfortable with can adopt the child. <br>  <br>  If you want to keep the baby and raise it, just make sure you have someone to help you.. because you're only 13. You won't get a job that pays good money, so you will definitely need some support. But, I personally think that you should give the baby up for adoption. The baby will be adopted by parents who can't conceive, and parents that will love the baby unconditionally. <br>  <br>  But, it is your baby, and it is your decision. I just hope you make the right one. Good luck to you and your baby.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	OMG thats terrible!<br>  When i first saw this i thought that you were one of those horribe immature teens that get preggo but your just a regular teen that got raped i am will you will not getting an abortion but i mean if you really cant take care of your baby you will have to give him/her up for abortion and also giving him/her up for adoption doesnt always mean you need them out of there live sometimes they give you visting vistation and the second you look into that sweet babies eyes you will know what you have to do and know that whatever happens you will always love your baby<br>  <br>  hope you feel better you are in my prayers :)|`|wsaWOwLIaa	i with you about not geting an abortion because only god can take a life away. i think the only thing you can do is have the baby, and you could put it up for adoption if you dont want to take care of it, or if you keep it, your family could help you raise it. cus i've had people in my class do both things before. but you do whatever you feel is right. i wish that would have never happened to you...but dont hate it because of what happened. it's a new life and if you keep it he/she will look up to you.|`|7p9qgkSFaa	Well, I think you should keep the baby and see if you want to keep it or not (adoption wise). also, false positives are rare so you most likely are pregnant. You really should tell your parents soon, you will need prenatal vitamins and soon before you know it a baby will be here. If you need someone to talk to just click on my channel and click IM or email. My sister is pregnant too so I can help you by giving you some tips on what to eat and what not to eat. And other kinds of tips, too.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Giving your baby up for adoption doesn't mean you don't love him/her.

I know I wouldn't...God will forgive you for getting an abortion it is the best idea and that way you want have to be pregnant at school! Adoption is not the way to go trust me! Maybe if you were a little older but still!|`|Bz6IZnoFaa	that is Absolutely horrible. questions like this make me want to cry. if you are against abortion then have the baby and put it up for adoption. the baby needs a loving family, and chances are there is a family out there that needs it (maybe one of them is in able to have kids). If you feel like you will have feeling of hate i completely understand, but you shouldn't have to live with that and neither should the kid. plus your not financially stable to have a kid. first talk to your mom about it and tell her its because your were raped and your not sexually active. then go to the clinic and get a professional test.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Only you can decide what to do. I'm glad you're against abortion. I was going to say that you could put the baby up for adoption, but then you said you hated that your mother didn't want you. Well, sometimes adoption is best for the baby. If you are not ready to raise a child, and no one in your family is willing to take care of the baby for you when you are at school, adoption is the best option. Remember that if you put your child up for adoption, it does not mean you lose contact with him/her forever. You can still keep in touch with the adoptive parents, and they can send you pictures as the baby grows up. I hope this all works out for you. Best of luck. =)

While having s-x before marriage leads to this kind of thing, you guys are at least taking responsibility for your actions.  I know that I don't know you, but have you considered getting married?  You've already made the commitment to your children, I think you should make the commitment to eachother and be role models for your little ones.  Agree to stick it out no matter what and make it work.  Marriage isn't all fun and games, but you two are going to have your hands full.  I think that taking that next step of marriage will help to ease her mind and give you a sense of belonging to the family.  She deserves your best and your best love, because she is mothering your children, which is the hardest job there has ever been.  You are so very fortunate to have such amazing family that is helping you do things that need done.  I think your parents would love to see you two get married as well.  To take part in your special ceremony.  Just be sure not to take advantage of them.  Well, i've said my piece, hope it's helpful!
0caa6e1fa230ee8e967b66725f6a0dd6aa	that's normal during pregnancy, i forget what the name for it is. it runs straight up and down right? it's supposed to get darker the further along you get.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	the black line that pregnant women get? I'm not sure what it's called but some people either get it or don't. It's from the hormone in your body making it darker.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	It's called a stretch mark|`|BilLTGLFaa	It's called Linea Nigra. It's just extra pigmentation in the skin caused by the stretching of your belly. Some pregnant women get it and some don't, most do. I'm 6 months and I JUST started to get one, it's still very light.|`|IA1irLy7aa	do you mean the dark line that goes from your belly button down? that is called the line of Nigera or something to that effect. or do you meant a redish or purple line just anywhere on your stomach they are stretch marks.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	It's probably either a stretch mark or linea nigra<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/linea-nigra.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/sy...</a>|`|AA11548630	linea nigra<br>  just keep applying cocoa butter or olive oil and as soon as you deliver it will start disappearing gradually<br>  keep away from direct sunlight by using sunscreen to avoid permanent darkening of the skin|`|plI0WOrUaa	If you are pregnant, it is probably the linea nigra.  It is a black line that forms when pregnant.  Its where the muscles of the abdomen meet in the middle, and the line appears when the muscles are being stretched due to the increasing size of your belly.  SOme women only get it from the bellybutton down, where others from the belly button up.  Some people get it the whole way up the belly.  It will fade after giving birth.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Its called the linea nigra. Its normal in pregnancy. Its because of an increase in pigmentation, brought on by extra estrogen in your body during pregnancy. Its the same thing that makes pregnant women have darker nipples, but not everyone experiences this.|`|NVmDVBPyaa	Lots of women get this during pregnancy.  It goes away after birth (may take a few months to completely go away).  It's called a linnea negra (I think that's spelled right).  It's caused by hormones.  Nothing to worry about.|`|s2JBY0ewaa	are you talking about the one right in the middle of your stomach? ive always asked myself that same question. i had that line when i was pregnant. But i really dont know why its there. It dissapeared like2weeks after i had my daughter|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Its called A strech mark because the baby and your belly have grown/streched or if you had the baby pushing could have caused it and  c section leaves a scar line|`|Xg9tvcOJaa	it is called a stretch mark or maybe it is your stomach it is big because most people have that line in the middle|`|AA11197832	Well if your not pregnant I have NO idea....sorry|`|ZsQBhtUxaa	being fat get you those thing (: ahha!
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Instead of telling her "no," you need to start telling her what she *is* allowed to do.  At this age, it's still all about redirection and reinforcement for good behavior.  <br>  <br>  A friend of mine who used to work in a preschool said that they were taught to say, "Use your walking feet!" or "Walk, please," instead of "No running!"  The kids either hear "no," but don't understand what they're supposed to do instead, or they only hear "running" so keep doing what they're doing.<br>  <br>  The same thing applies to your toddler.  So if she starts to scream at you, get down at her level and gently ask her to use her words.  Even if she doesn't have many words, that's a way to encourage her to communicate what she needs/wants to you in some way.  <br>  <br>  You also need to give her a lot of positive attention and interaction throughout the day.  The more secure she feels that you'll pay attention to her, the more independent she'll become, and the better behaved she'll be.  <br>  <br>  This age is also frustrating because they want to communicate so many things, but don't have the vocabulary or language skills to say what they want to.  My 18-month-old has really gotten into baby signing, and he can do at least 10 signs consistently (more, all done, please, thank you, water, milk, juice, ice cream, apple, banana, eat, potty).  My girls never got into signing as much as he has, and it has been a lifesaver b/c we're able to understand at least some of the things that he's trying to say.  It's not too late to try some signing with your daughter, and it may help your communication.<br>  <br>  I've made plenty of mistakes so far with my three kids (ages 5, 4, and 18 months), but one thing I've learned is that I get better results with them when I really try to understand what they're feeling and what they need and help them to work through it.  Negative reactions and even ignoring tantrums do have their place, but they can't be the only tools in the toolbox, if you KWIM.<br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, and try again with her tomorrow.  Good luck!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	It depends on what she's doing, I think. She's still young, she may be figuring out that doing certain things will get your attention... so if you make a big deal out of it, she'll probably just continue to do it since she thinks its a good thing you're getting upset. If its something small, just keep doing what you're doing and try not to make a huge deal out of it... so she doesn't think its a good thing :)|`|ee1o46cTaa	take her to a  chiron and have her balanced,they seem hocus pocus but seriously they work i hope you have one in your area.|`|1o1ZoFQQaa	im going through the same thhing and shes 19 months
4iXL4C6paa	I would suggest you go with the basics, clothes, diapers, wipes, blankets, basically things you KNOW you will be using.  To me the bottle warmers, wipe warmer (which dried out all my wipes), diaper genie (which I never used because I would rather just take the diaper and throw it away outside then change a trash can full of poo lol) all of those are a waste of money in my opinion.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	I suggest getting a book.  A really helpful book I read is called Baby Bargains.  It gives you guidelines about stuff you need for a baby, what you should spend money on and tips on where/what you can save money on.  Its been really helpful.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I got a changing table and my baby is 5 weeks old... I have not used it once.  So to me, that was a waste of money.|`|tMxGi4hPaa	Diapers & wipes- I like Pampers, Playtex Drop-Ins if you're using bottles, flannel receiving blankets, lots of burp rags- cloth diapers work good, and they're cheaper, baby washcloths, a bath tub, baby wash. For clothes, I would just get onesies and sleep and plays. I found the best ones are the Gerber ones- they zip & are much easier to get on a squirming baby. Get a pack & play or a bassinet, a travel system will be good to have, too. That's everything I can think of. Good luck.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Hi and congrats!<br>  <br>  You should get a bouncy chair (although the things I'll mention might be gotten if you have a shower & put them on the registry). A bouncy chair that vibrates is VERRRRRRRRRY helpful. <br>  <br>  Crib sheets-at least 5 or 6. And you most DEFINITELY need at LEAST 2 waterproof mattress pads. Trust me, at least 2. If your child leaks or vomits in the middle of the night you definitely want another one ready. I actually went through that 2 wks ago. <br>  <br>  A mobile is nice but not 100% necessary. My daughter likes hers. <br>  <br>  Some people say swings are a must. Some kids like them; some do not. My daughter didn't like it all that much.<br>  <br>  You do NOT need a bottle warmer, nor a wipe warmer. Somebody gave us Diaper Champ (you can google it if you want). It uses regular 13 gallon garbage bags. The smell sometimes isn't the best but it's not really that bad. And it beats paying for the refills for the diaper genie.<br>  <br>  You will need onesies. Shortsleeved ones at least a 5 pk. Gerber is a good brand although I've noticed Carters to run a bit big. I prefer them but have used Gerber.<br>  <br>  A MONITOR is a must. Someone gave us theirs. Before that I wanted a video one. Glad I didn't. We have a regular Safety 1st one that has been used on my friend's 3 kids. Works great.<br>  <br>  Burp cloths. What we did was this...we received SO many thin receiving blankets at our shower that I couldn't possibly use them all so I asked my mom to make burp cloths. That was one of THE best gifts EVER!! They are GREAT! So many, too. You could always use cloth diapers or even kitchen towels. <br>  <br>  I know there's more but my baby needs a bath in a minute & daddy gives it to her but I need to help. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helped you some!|`|cezWu0Wnaa	i mostly agree with the others but i do use my changing pad a lot. i'd like to add a boppy pillow to this list. it's excellent for nursing the baby. Also buy a nail clipper. newborns have sharp nails and they love to scratch themselves|`|w3ob12X6aa	yeah i def. agree with the changing table i never use mine, and i also never used my crib because i cosleep with my baby but everyone is diff., good luck|`|UkQuMykiaa	- Bassinet/crib and extra sheets to go with<br>  - Receiving blankets<br>  - 4-5 sleepers (outfits are great, but sleepers are a must!)<br>  - As someone else suggested - cloth diapers for burp clothes - they work great!!<br>  - Diapers/wipes (newborn size are great for the first week or two, but don't buy to many - these babies grow fast!)<br>  - Bottles - bottle brush (bottle warmer - VERY unnecessary can use warm water to heat your bottles)<br>  - waterproof bassinet/crib pad to put under the sheet - this is not a absolute necessity - but useful<br>  <br>  That is all I can think of for now - <br>  <br>  Congrats & good luck!|`|zHy0z7sAaa	I used a lot of receiving blankets at first to swaddle my daughter Piper.Now she is older and doesn't use them so some of them I use as cleaning rags.I never use her bathtub,wipes warmer,diaper genie,or her bouncy seat. I would suggest stocking up on diapers in size 1,2 and 3.Wipes.A good set of bottles.I like Dr. Browns.And if you plan on getting your baby a swing I suggest one like we own by Fisher Price that can actually plug into the wall instead of running off batteries, that way you don't have to keep shelling out money to replace the costly size 'D' batteries most swings require.|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	well if ur gonna have a baby shower i'd wait to see want u need after that, if no baby shower then you will need<br>  <br>  crib, bassinet, crib sheets, a cradle swing, a bouncy seat, receiving blankets,clothes not to many cause babies grow out of them sooo fast, socks, buy easy access pjs cause it's easier to change baby at night when u can bearly keep ur eyes open, diapers, onesies, burp clothes, baby shampoo, diaper cream and u can just keep adding after baby arrives. hope this helps.|`|ki3XY49daa	I agree that a changing table would be a waste of time.  I've never used one.  You usually use what's right there beside you be it your bed or the couch.  I like the Playtex bottles, but they add up quite a bit because you have to continuously replace the refills.  They're good bottles though for sure.  Have diapers, bottles, blankets, a bulb syringe (because there will be still be fluid coming out for a little while after birth), lots of wipes, car seat and Pack 'N' Play.  Aside from those things, it's really a matter of preference. :)|`|TJusfEnlaa	These things are essential for a newborn... everything else can wait<br>  <br>  * Cot or a bassinette<br>  * Blankets<br>  * 0000 and 000 size clothes<br>  * Pram<br>  * Baby bath<br>  * Bouncy chair or swing<br>  * Bottles or a breastpump <-- just in case u breastfeed and have troubles<br>  * Oh yeah forgot about nappies, wipes and nappy rash cream!<br>  <br>  I honestly think that is all u need to begin with...|`|uclo2Um1aa	If it a little boy think really hard a bout it and then do NOT have him circumcised.<br>  Please, research if for your self and let him stay intact.<br>  It will really hurts him and it's no longer recomended and it changes him for life.|`|CzAsukYtaa	a bassinet is good most ppl i know that have had kids prefer to put there new born in a bassinet for the first few weeks|`|vLOjcH7paa	I'm a first time Mom too and I had TONS of stuff I didn't need or use.

I8lFqyyFaa	It doesn't really sound that crazy to me.  Kids at 8 still do stuff like this.  Worst case scenario at this point is maybe he's gay.  And you can't even begin to go labeling or identifying kids at that age.  At prepuberty he's still exploring in an innocent dress-up kind of way.  I wouldn't freak out - THAT might be scarring, not trying on your underwear.  But I would demand that my underwear stay in it's drawers.  How else are you going to find it in the mornings?  lol.|`|BpYwAwIOaa	Get your child to spend time with his dad. Take him out and get him closer to boys and girls. Maybe sine he's so use to you he tries to foloow you which in this case seems to be the bad habit. Or maybe he may think that your underwear is the same as his. Well unless he wears a thong. (really gross).|`|VcGnf0WMaa	you should a a long talk with him put your foot down and say that is not right and make him spend his time with his dad.|`|hXk3s9rSaa	it seems like he is very close to you and maybe "wants to be like mommy" try sitting him down and saying that these are my underwear and these are yours. get him underwear that he wants to wear too. therapy seems extreme in this case, but it is your decision. in my opinion, hide you underwear and talk to him about it|`|EFBUPnITaa	honestly,you need to really pay attention to any kind of suspicious signs that happens to concern you!<br>  <br>  andd hide you underwearrr;]|`|rWoaRdljaa	tell him these are mommy's undies if you want some mommy will buy you your own. and lock your closets and drawers|`|8LhEs3WLaa	My children 8 & 6 often take my undies and either wear them or put them on their teddies. It can be quite frustrating when I can't find my knickers but they are just having fun in big peoples clothes. Don't you ever remember wearing your mums clothes. They love to take my bras and stuff them with tissues too. We laugh about it and then the kids feel comfortable talking about it. I don't think they are weird but I think they have fun trying to shock me. The child is 8 and you are probably the most important person in his life therefore he wants to be like mum and unfortunately for us, that means borrowing our bras, undies, high heels and what ever else takes their fancy. Use this as a way to play and talk to your son. And the biggest thing of all is ENJOY. One day he will be a big boy and your undies will just be disturbing to him. Good Luck!
AA10456962	my husband only made love to me 4 times throughout my pregnancy and i found out when i was 5 wks so i know how you feel i asked my husband why because i thought he had gone of me and only saw me as a baby maker -lol- (hormomes) he just said it was because he didnt want to hurt me or the baby and he didnt feel it was right which i thought was really sweet i spoke to a family memeber about it and she said her husband was the same when she was pregnant and she thought that showed how decent he was.anyway my baby is 14 weeks old now and everything is back to normal if not better - congratulations on your good news!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	It really just varies by the people on the sex drive once someone gets pregnant.  And honestly, it could be his age.. Or he may be scared that he'll hurt you or the baby.  I know my husband (he's 23) was scared to death that he would hurt me and the baby, so I had to get the doctor to reassure him that it wouldn't cause any problems.  Just talk to him about it and maybe ask him why he's not in the mood anymore.. Good luck!|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Express things to him.. just start gettin on his business. He may feel lazy or he feels uncomfortable. I think it's important to talk and to stay calm Best of luck|`|96HWpdkFaa	Alot of guys are like that, it's not because they aren't attracted...but some are scared that they will hurt the baby or that the baby will feel it or they just don't feel right doing it when a girl is pregnant cause they will think about the baby the whole time. It's normal, Why don't you try talking to him? I'm 10 weeks and 4 days and my husband and I didn't have sex for a week when I found out but then we started to agian.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Now isn't the time for him to be bored of commitment - you're having a child! Some men are actually sort of scared of sex with their pregnant partners. My husband took a lot of convincing that he wasn't going to "poke the baby's head"!<br>  <br>  You asked us not to say anything about the age difference - but asked if it had anything to do with his age right before.. so I'm just going to throw out there that some people (men and women) lose their sex drive as they age because their bodies aren't producing as many reproduction-related hormones. <br>  <br>  Put the moves on him when he comes home and if he rebuffs you, then sit him down and talk about it calmly. Maybe he's really stressed out because of work and just hasn't felt sexual. Good luck and congrats!

1YdeUn1Caa	People act like the only way babies are miscarried are when people smoke. So why do non smokers miscarry? Nobody has yet to give me a legit answer. If it's not smoking, then why? If it genetics, then can't a smoker who miscarries reason be genetics too? Of course not, that would take smoking off of the hook. <br>  The problem is, people listen to these lab rats who camp out in their labs 24/7 with no life, and no family, concocting all kinds of crap, and people believe it, because they say so. Throw away 30-60 years worth of history, it's what the lab rats say now. <br>  Then there's the second hand smoke deal. Don't get me started there. <br>  If second hand smoke was as dangerous as people believe it is, there would be nobody alive in their 50s and 60s.|`|96HWpdkFaa	The doctors are smarter now, have more tests they can do and can figure out things better now. Smoking CAN be dangerous for the baby and drinking DEFANITLY is NOT good for the baby.<br>  <br>  And eating healthy makes your BODY healthy and the BABY healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  People who wanr a healthy pregnancy are cautious I guess.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Because times have changed and more studies have been done in the medical field as years have passed. My doc told me that take a lot of what you read in pregnancy books with a grain of salt...if you were to completely abide by the book then you'd be pretty limited to what you could do during pregnancy.<br>  Whats most important is to take your prenatals, avoid alcohol, drugs and smoking.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Because of all the new research and studies that prove that there are strong links between certain lifestyle factors, and an unhealthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The mortality rate is now where near as high as it used to be for newborns and mothers, and we have these 'trendy' studies to that for it.<br>  <br>  Back 30 years ago, doctors did not know as much as they do now, as they did not have the technology.|`|TN6IQYoPaa	I know what u mean, i feel very silly on being so paranoid. I didn't tell many people abt it since it's too early, but still all those who know like my mother, his mom our siblings, they all have something or the other to say. And i just don't want anything to happen to the baby, and i'm not feeling nausea or cravings, it's crazy but that's another thing that's bothering me. U r lucky and very smart to be all chill and relaxed, I just can't!!! :-(|`|AA11548630	because when a mother miscarried they just didn't know why<br>  when a baby was born with a defect or some problem they tried treating it with or without success<br>  you can't leave your baby to "luck", i don't think God will be pleased either if a mother blamed him for say a neural tube defect because she chose not to take folic acid<br>  we are blessed with the chance to help prevent as many misfortunes as possible during our pregnancies<br>  i say it's a small price to pay, it's our jobs as parents to provide the best for our children even the ones we didn't deliver yet<br>  you may not eat so many greens but just keep taking folic acid regularly and try eating as much fresh fruits and veggies even if it's just an apple and fruit juice|`|pzLDXL6gaa	People want the best for their baby which is why they are cautious...I agree some things if you do or don't do will have no ill effects, but smoking and drinking are a definite no-no.<br>  <br>  The very reason they know some things are bad now is because of in the past it wasn't frowned up and after a while they started to make the links! Not everybody turned out fine you know...not to mention you never know what minor problems might have been caused by maternal drinking. Isn't it best to do the safest thing, within reason? Not smoking and drinking while pregnant isn't the same as being a health nut, it's common sense, there is so much evidence on the harmful nature, even if you're not pregnant.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|sSRHQkROaa	a lot of woman who have experienced or watched someone experience anything bad with their pregnancy (as far as miscarriages and pre-eclampsia) tend to be a lot more concious.<br>  <br>  i haven't had any issues or have known anybody to have issues so i'm not to worrisome. i eat healthy because i actually crave soup and salad, and i never smoked, and the month i got pregnant was the month i stopped drinking =X<br>  <br>  on the other hand i have a friend who yells at me for taking out the trash because she thinks it's too heavy and i'll miscarry..and mind you i'm 30 weeks, and having a completely healthy pregnancy.|`|BilLTGLFaa	Nowadays they know a lot more about pregnancy then they used to. Take smoking for example. They used to say smoking was beneficial!! Now look at all of the people dying. (I've known 2) They know a lot more about the baby in the uterus as well, and what effects them. It's not about being a health nut when your pregnant, it's about being smart. There are a lot of things you CAN do safely while pregnant and a lot of things that should be done in moderation.|`|iCvG9kHqaa	I do agree with you on some parts there, especially with what people eat. All this uproar about Listeriosis kinda has me confused, I ate a lot of chips and gravy from a food court with my first pregnancy and the gravy probably would have been frowned upon but my daughter is fine, even as I ate processed meats and drank thickshakes which were considered a no no. I don't smoke and have only started to hate it more as I love having freash air to breath (grew up with our house basically blanketed in the smell) and after craving alcohol during my first pregnancy which I was good enough to hold off on, I found I didnt like it any way after my daughter was born. I find that leaving my hair colour is just easier too so I use pregnancy as an excuse to grow out the black lol.|`|DTYHoinVaa	The ones who annoy me are those who cannot lift a ten lb. object for risk of damaging the baby, or do any kind of manual labor. Ive always done things like lift, mow the lawn, carry everything. People tell me oh dont do that your pregnant. Well, no ****, but Im not broken! They spit the kids out in the fields back then n worked the rest of the day. Come on now people~|`|YNH2fmYWaa	well back thirty years ago the reason people smoked and drank during pregnancies is because nobody knew that it was bad for you in the first place! technology has gotten a little better since then. =]|`|VEkkn2Otaa	its called realizing what caused it, they have technology these days and found out OH those things do cause birth defects and problems DUH!|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Because research is more sophisticated and women want what is best for their babies.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think that now we have made so many advances in science.  This allows us to be more knowledgeable on what are the potential risks to a pregnancy, and what can increase the chances of a healthy baby.  I don't think that people are super cautious, just doing the best they can to have the healthiest baby possible.  It just gives you a sense of relief to know that you are doing what you can to lessen the chances of a problem with your child.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	...because they continue to do studies and research every year and more of them have proved certain things to be unhealthy and other things to be more healthy.  The baby can't protect itself, therefore it's the mother's job to do that..pregnant and once the baby is here.  Some people still don't care, and just do what they want, but the majority follow the rules because they want the healthiest pregnancy and baby as possible.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	I think there are more things in this world now to be cautious of, maybe that's why people are "pregnant health nuts".. and drinking and smoking have always been bad to do while pregnant..i think that people didn't start making a big deal about it though until research was done and found that it could cause problems! so because people didn't know, of course it wasn't a big deal! I actually do understand what you are saying though..i think people can still do things (not smoking and drinking) that people might think are bad to do while pregnancy, and still have a happy healthy baby! like you said...look back 30-40 years and take a look at all the things people did back then and their children turned out fine!|`|tZ1XPd1paa	Um, my mom didn't smoke OR drink when she was pregnant with my or my sister. Sorry. I don't frown upon who smokes during pregnancy, idk how hard it is to quit because I don't smoke. And just because someone else does it, doesn't mean your baby won't come out small, skinny, sickly and have fetal alcohol syndrome. Its 2009, and a lot has changed as far as research and studies about pregnancy.|`|pCS0d1axaa	It more to do with being safe then being sorry. You wouldn't want your child to have a birth defect caused by either drinking and smoking or any other substance abuse. I don't think you need to eat more greens just because you are pregnant. Just cut down on junk food but enjoy your meat. Enjoy|`|TuRO6QHlaa	because ppl are always ready to jump on a trend!! Most ppl that are insane about that sort of thing think they are better than everyone else anyways|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I think it is because we are more aware of risks associated with pregnancy. Compared to 30 years ago.|`|Q1I4PhO1aa	because its there babies and themselves..besides for me it was more keeping my figure and him healthy as well..

m4amCT5waa	I think both April Genevieve and April Katherine would be stunning combos!  April's gorgeous, simple, fresh, and easy to picture on any age group.  I really don't think you can go wrong with April, regardless of birth month.  It's established enough as a name that 'it's a month!' wouldn't detract from it in use.  :)|`|AA10463356	I like it very much.  April, May and June at one time were very popular names for girls.  It's only recently that I have noticed people naming their kids after the other months and the four seasons.  I knew a little girl named April when I was quite young.  I called her Ape for short.  She didn't seem to take it amiss and understood that it was a nickname of convenience and not of ill will.|`|cxhsI7tbaa	ehhh i dont like it that much some people might though. it seems like more of a dog name to me no offense. but if you pick it i would go with april katherine|`|6ri7AYC1aa	I like the name April.<br>  Actually I have a friend named April but she spells it Apryl.<br>  And I like both middle names|`|6kRhLbs9aa	My twin sister's name is April Leigh!

I love the name Genevieve, though.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	yeah|`|793RNStWaa	No.  I am a September baby, and I even think the name "September" is neat.  I can't say I like either of the middle names however.  Sorry.  I love the name Grace.  April Grace.  Pretty.  But that is just my own opinion.  I named my daughter Abigayle Kaela and chose to spell it differently than normal.  Have you considered the spelling as "Apryl"?<br>  <br>  What about April Genevive-Katherine (Last Name Here)?<br>  <br>  There's no rule that says you can only have one middle name.  I have two.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	April Katherine is the best choice of the two and sounds nice together, April can work for anyone even if the baby is not born in April.

AA10952583	you could be
I6qfoJaiaa	I would complain to a manager and if it's not policy for EVERYONE to prove theirs kids age then why should you?|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	I would definitely complain about this!!!! Who the heck made her the child development police? Just because your daughter can do things that some of the older ones can't you need proof that she is under? That is beyond ridiculous! Every kid developes and learns differently. Complain away! You have just as much right to bring your daughter there for free as the other 2 yr old and under parents!|`|irHF6CBPaa	I would complaint since the person was calling you a liar right to your face I take the proof of age ID or birth certificate If this is a place were your daughter enjoys to go I don't think she should be punish for having good skills just go back speak with the manager<br>  <br>  Edit: I also agreed  with flubuster|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I would complain to management! What are you supposed to do? go get a state issued ID so she can get into the play place? That is pretty ridiculous. I wouldn't go back either.|`|eRpNSTgpaa	omg i couldn't believe this..yes i would complain she didn't sound very nice about the way she approached you about this, unless your daughter looks seriously older than she is, all these things you could take as a compliment, maybe your daughter is alot cleverer than most 18 month old babies, but i must say since when has this lady been such an expert on babies. i would think most 18 month old could wing a ball some...feeding herself with a knife and fork, yeah that's a bit ahead cos they don't always know how 2  use the knife, sounds like you need to speak 2 the management and say how petit she was o over a few quid...some people have nothing better to do with there time|`|sJClbSHGaa	That is just plain insane. I think you should complain to the manager of the play place (bring ID just to help prove your case) and tell him or her exactly what happened with the staff member.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Thats ridiculous!! I would complain, I mean if she asked you once then you could just ignore it, but to question you is ridiculous!! I would take it as a compliment though that your daughter is advanced for her age!<br>  <br>  My friend once visited a chinese buffet and its cheaper if your under 140cm, they actually got out a measuring tape and measured how tall her daughter was!!! (she was less than 140cm)..|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Who gives a flying poop how old she is?! Let her play. If she is not causing any problems I wouldn't even consider approaching a parent. I would call and make a complaint and let them know they crossed the line and if they want proof of age for children under 2 then they need to post a sign requesting such information.<br>  <br>  I'd continue to return and tell them if they approach again that until they show some sort of information that requires you to show ID that they can bite your bum. Who carries their baby's birth certificate or SS card?!|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Oh I'm sure your local evening paper would be most interested to hear all about that - this would be the best way of getting your own back - the soft play place will get such negative publicity, if that doesn't change their attitude, nothing will.<br>  <br>  Complaining to the soft play place is a waste of time in my opinion - they don't really care what you  think!|`|nmu6coapaa	Wow, that was so cheeky of her! I wouldn't go back if I was you if there is another soft play place nearby but if your daughter enjoyed it and there are no others it wouldn't be fair not to take her back! On the upside though, nice compliment for your obviously advanced daughter! LOL!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	that's ridiculous.  was it the owner or an employee?  if they are new, i bet they'll be out of business soon.  i wouldn't go back either.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I would recommend calling and letting someone else know of the issue. Make sure they know you're planning on telling a lot o people how rudely you were treated. Places like that survive on word of mouth referrals and repeat customers. They should offer you a apology and *hopefully* something free.<br>  <br>  If no apology is forth coming I would suggest a call/e-mail to your local paper and news station!|`|VMASMHX6aa	It's ridiculous I agree, but I expect it's one of their conditions of entry. The soft play area is private property and they reserve the right to deny admission or ask for ID.<br>  Complaining is not going to do anything. They will just say they have the right to do this.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	i know like who carries a birth certificate around lol but it would have been funny to show the women and say look and then she would have had to shut up lol. teach her to be rude.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	i would have some fun with it and go back again - this time with a purpoe of driving them nuts :).. if asked about the proof of age, say that you forgot your baby's driver's license at home :)|`|hsyI1DxDaa	I'm no expert on kids, but what the hell? That's..that's...oh man, there's so many things wrong with that, I don't even know how to begin.|`|Roui5iT5aa	that's ridiculous, that person should be working in a night club not a play gym, i'd speak to the owner/manager for sure!|`|GU3RauKOaa	Well she is pretty close to 2 years old so if they said "because she looks around 2 years old" it would make sense. But basing it on her developmental level is just ridiculous. Good for you, your kid is coordinated and you've taught her how to do things for herself at an early age. She's advanced, just because other kids can't do what she can doesn't mean she must be over 2 yrs! That's pretty stupid of the employee.<br>  <br>  However, even though she had stupid reasons, your daughter is getting close to the age limit so I would carry her medical insurance card or something (not her birth certificate as it might get lost) with her birthday for future visits there. That way its no real hassle for you if they come to bother you, and you won't have any problems.<br>  <br>  And good for you for having a coordinated daughter! My 17 month old uses a spoon perfectly but she definately doesn't look like a 2 year old. I would probably be proud though if she was mistaken for one because of her skills, well proud until they tried to make me pay for her! lol!|`|b5JnSBstaa	I would definately call and speak to a manager and ask them if its their company policy to require proof of age. If it isn't, let them know that one of their staff members demanded you bring ID for your child. If it is their company policy, you can't really be mad at them, the employee was just doing their job.  But, it seems really weird that they wouldn't ask for ID the minute you walked into the building, instead they waited for you to sit down and eat.  You can't help that your child is advanced and coordinated. LOL!!!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I've been to lots of soft play areas, and I've only been asked their ages to confirm what price they're paying. No-one has ever questioned how old they were. <br>  <br>  I applied for a nursery place once for my 2 yr old, and they phoned to say bring her in (the DOB was on the form I filled in). After the 2nd day, they phoned me and told me I couldn't bring her any more as they didn't realise she was so young!!!! They said they didn't realise because she could zip her coat up. They were generally very rude to me. I never went back.
9zwSclnLaa	Just walk up to them and say "Hey" and then strike up friendly conversation with them like:  "Oh, it's really nice out here" or "Aww cool, look at the seagulls out there" and hope he bites :)<br>  <br>  The beach is a good place to meet cool guys.  So are restaurants, docks, boating stores, and parks.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Be aggressive, while you are on the beach and you see a boy you like walk up to him & say Hi and ask him where he is from.  From there you can talk about movies and music.|`|yIRcd5X8aa	At your age the best place to meet guys would be at the beach or at the mall, just wear something cute and hang out with your girls and watch those cute boys line up =D|`|q6MDThTSaa	just talk to him. trust me, guys are reeeaaally easy goin with that ;)|`|WGAFP6mSaa	I agree with the second answer.<br>  <br>  You should 'accidently' throw a volleyball at them and look around and be like to your friend "Whoa, where'd it go?", then hopefully he'll bring it back to you then be like "Sorry about that" w/ the flirty smile and just start a conversation from there.<br>  <br>  Have fun and happy early spring break!!<br>  <br>  BTW, bring your phone so you can get some numbers..haha. =]|`|I64JOuMKaa	haha maybe bring a beach volleyball to the beach, or a frisbeee, and If you see a cute guy throw it at them and laugh , and if they pick it up and walk over to you to give it back start conversation , just be like<br>  <br>  "sorrrry =P haha im from _______ , whaats your name ? wanna play ?"
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	It's normal, because he's not properly potty-trained.  He doesn't understand his body's cues that he has to potty and just wants to go all the time.  Was he rewarded for using the potty at any time?  That could lead to him going potty all the time, in hopes of getting a treat.  Most generally, it's something they outgrow though as they learn their bodies' signals.|`|zKeD5M6Faa	Yes very normal. He's potty training...this is new and a big step for the little guy. Just try to go with it and maybe everytime he pee's, really pee's give him a star or something and then he'll start to understand....<br>  Good Luck<br>  P.S. Boys are usually a little tougher to potty train from my experience|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	I agree with both the previous answers...it is normal but I too was wonder if there was a reward like candy given for going in the potty. I'm sure you are tired of playing that game all day of going in there to help every 5 or 10 minutes. Is he tall enuf to stand when get he goes? If not I would suggest getting a small stool for him to stand on let him go in there by himself. Maybe part of the fun for him is having you get up and go in there with him.|`|iJygIvf1aa	That happens all the time, I've babysat alot of children like that. It is absolutly normal.
6UX9C1qoaa	in my oppinion i wouldnt im a guy and i went through this ... i was the one who got dumped and well... i sucked i got into a big fight with my best friend and she eventually dumped him. it was kind oof awkward after since my best friend was rubbing it in my face but later we got over it and we're now back to being great friends. answer my questions|`|I64JOuMKaa	well if my bestfriend went out with my boyfriend or ex now that well we sorta dumped each other, but we both sorta miss each other but its not gunna work.<br>  <br>  if my bestfriend went out with him<br>  is freaking slap her across the face.<br>  <br>  I mean, its alright if its like in maybe like 6months - to a year after the relationship  has ended<br>  but anywhere earlier than that is not okay.<br>  <br>  Since it was a year ago, try telling the guy you like to talk to your ex and see if he still cares.<br>  <br>  The last thing you wanna do is screw up somebodys friendship.<br>  <br>  Because me and my ex brokeup , this girl, who was like one of my bestfriends flirted with my boyfriend while i was on vacation whats why we broke up. <br>  that biaaaaaaaaaatch i will never be friends with her again : )|`|sJClbSHGaa	I'm not a guy, but you should totally go for it! It was only 2 weeks last year and you didn't even kiss him, so his friend is fair game!  And I really don't think you'd ruin his friendship with your ex. In my own experience with guys, they tend to get over girls rather quickly unless he was obsessed with you or something.
ANHsv4ENaa	The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley. I still co-sleep but I know ppl who swear by the no cry solution. <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/</a><br>  I love how you stated it, "Those nutjob babywise people."

Unless you plan on doing some sort of cry it out or being up and down all night getting baby back to sleep you're out of luck.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	The No Cry Sleep Solution is most likely what you are talking about. I moved my son by starting with naps only. After getting good at naps we added bed time and hasn't been a problem at all. He sleeps the same in his crib as he does in my bed.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It's not a book but it will hopefully help just as much. Good luck.<br>  <a href="http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/week-36/crib-training.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/w...</a>|`|deIzFnV8aa	You have heard of The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantely. Here are a few of her ideas:<br>  <br>  Let your son spend some playtime in the crib to get used to it.<br>  <br>  Roll up a receiving blanket to put next to him so it feels like someone is there.  Wear it inside your shirt to give it that comforting mommy smell.<br>  <br>  If you have room, start with the crib in your room right next to your bed.  You can even start with the side down, as long as you make sure it is safe and baby can't get stuck in the crack between the crib and the bed.<br>  <br>  And her advice is always to stop and comfort baby when he gets too upset. If you end up doing partial nights in your bed, or even some full nights in your bed because you and he just can't take it that day, its ok, its still progress in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Obviously she has a lot of other ideas about self-soothing to sleep; worth a visit to your library.|`|2LflHv23aa	I have the No cry sleep solution book. I have been trying for about three months to do the same thing. I have just began reading the book and my husband and I have already found it helpful. <br>  Good luck.

f5VcGCobaa	Is she keeping him in training pants 24 hours a day? My niece wore training pants after she was 2 only at night to bed. Generally, most kids will stop when other children start making fun of them. When this happens offer your child sympathy, but agree with the other kids. You can say, "I'm sorry that they were mean to you. They should have spoken to you in a nicer way. If you want to wear big kid underwear, I will get you any kind that you like." <br>  If they have a favorite character, buy underwear with the character on it and have it ready for when they decide. My mother has been a child care provider and foster parent since I was a small child. She says the best time to potty train is in the summer after they turn 2-3 years old (if they are an only child, otherwise after 18 months) because kids wear fewer clothes in the summer and it's easier to change clothes. Buy a kiddie pool and tell him he can't wear training pants in the pool.<br>  If you are not a relative, then it is none of your business. But you can buy him the underwear as a present.|`|5ujzs0k3aa	You can never be too old to start potty training.  He may be in pull ups still, simply because she lets him be.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	then mom needs to potty train the child...but really does it matter when the kid is 15 if he trained at 2 or at 5?|`|AA11197832	What really...My son is 2 and I cannot wait for the day that he's ready.

It was just big enough for her to splash a little but not so big that it felt unsafe.  <br>  <br>  Once she moved to bathing in the big tub, I made the rule that she is not allowed to stand up in the bathtub unless I am washing her bottom.  When she does try to stand up, I tell her "Sit down, Sylvia, you're not allowed to stand up in the tub" and she'll comply by the second or third time I ask at the very latest.  It's important to have rules and discipline when it comes to matters of safety, both your son's and yours.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HyRIhUvPaa	why dont you try bathing him in the sink. it would be much easier for you and you dont have to lean over. my mum told me that i love being bathed in the sink.

They called my pregnancy a Ghost pregnancy. Everything to do with the pregnancy, but no baby formed. I have had another miscarriage and was just happy the baby didn't actually form. You could possible have a miscarriage later on in your pregnancy so I would take it easy and make sure your levels go up instead of down. Congrats on your pregnancy and good luck. I wouldn't wish what I went through on anyone!
ki3XY49daa	Holy crap!!  I can't believe you're not already in labor truthfully.  Honestly, it sucks, but you could actually still go all the way and stay right where you're at now.  Or, you could go into labor any day now.  It's just a matter of what your body wants to do.  I'd have my bag packed to be on the safe side.  No question your body's gearing up for labor.  Pay attention to your body.  I know it's graphic, but usually right before the onset of labor, your bowels will empty out ALOT because the body has to be clear for labor.  So, when that starts happening, I'd start getting ready.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	took me 3 weeks|`|5f6XnInEaa	The word is effaced.<br>  <br>  And, I was in the same boat as you, I still thankfully made it to 38 weeks.|`|QrZcKRsDaa	50% EFFACED...lol.

By nurturing a child you are giving them a sense of stability and they are able to thrive properly. <br>  <br>  But when a child is isolated (as is the case of Feral children) and is left with out being nurtured then they have a more difficult time functioning in the world. <br>  <br>  Feral children are the prime example of how important human nurturing is on children's emotional, physical, and psychological developments. <br>  <br>  Here's some examples on why nurture is so important to a child's development: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/sci_feralc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.world-mysteries.com/sci_feral...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(fera...</a>
plI0WOrUaa	Yes it's perfectly normal.  I am 24 weeks and don't feel constant movement.  My baby is active around the same time that yours is also.  The baby isn't awake all of the time, and is often lulled to sleep by your activity.  So if you are out moving around, working etc, the baby will often fall asleep from the vibrations of your movements.  Its normal not to feel movement all day long.  Hours without movement is fine.  Some days i feel my baby hardly moves at all, then the next she's very lively.  I wouldn't worry at all.  I think its perfectly normal movement!!|`|dPl6Al1caa	It's perfectly fine.  They say there is a formula to tell if the movement is normal, but since when does a fetus exist based on modern medicine's rules?  When I got towards the end of my 2nd trimester, the movements really really slowed down, but for some reason I wasn't nervous, I just knew she was fine in there and she was gonna do whatever she felt like.  After 2 or 3 weeks, I got back to feeling her move more regularly.  She is 16 months now, perfectly healthy and happy!|`|BilLTGLFaa	As long as you don't go an entire day without feeling any movements you're perfectly fine! The baby will sleep at odd times throughout the day, and will actually be rocked to sleep if you work on your feet all day (like I do) Just keep watch on if you go a whole day without feeling the baby. If you do, call your doctor. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  *** Thumbs down? LOL Look it up people, it even says so in "What to Expect". Do your research before you give a thumbs down.|`|QSodlfMraa	girl be happy, my little is on her own time she move when ever is want at 24 weeks.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	yes, its fine not to feel the baby for a while. even this early they are getting on sleeping patterns, so your baby is probably just sleeping.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Yes because the baby is probably sleeping or resting. They need all of their energy to grow. Also when you walk around during the day you are actually rocking them to sleep. This is why they usually fall asleep or calm down when you rock them when the are born since it gives them the feeling of being in the womb. When you sit down and relax or especially lying down still at night, the baby wakes up and that is why they seem more active at those times. Hope this helped. I always found this subject very fascinating.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Totally 100% normal, at this stage in pregnancy you cant count on kicks or movements to ensure baby is ok, its just too soon.  This is my 2nd pregnancy, I am 20 weeks and she goes nuts when I am resting or after I have eaten and than times I dont feel her for a little bit.  Soon enough you will feel her a lot more and stronger.  Dont worry!!|`|kdSuwt8paa	You miss those little signs of life when the baby is probably fast asleep!    I have put a link to a helpful web site.|`|DTYHoinVaa	yes, start to really regulate at like 25 weeks or so, perfectly normal.
KOwzDLPdaa	It is possible that you are one of those people who don't produce enough of the pregnancy hormone in you urine until later in pregnancy. My first was like that. It was a long time before a test came up positive.<br>  <br>  Get some blood work done asap and good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	See the doctor.  You either need prenatal care or a new implant.
WYk0zYdhaa	Shame on them!  Being your third (this is my second and everyone said the same to me).. you show a LOT earlier.  Things happen faster too like movement and stuff,  The docs still base due dates on your lmp thinking you ovulated 14 days after... not the case with me.  I got my positive at 38 days and then went in.  They did a scan since I lost one previously and freaked out because they couldn't see what they expected to see at 6 weeks!  They freaked me out too.  <br>  My hormone levels were way up.  Everything was fine,  I started being noticably pregnant (like to other people this time around) at like 10 weeks!  I mean I looked 5 months.  No worries they can do the scan and see for sure but you may have ovulated later and so they never know.  People were convinced I was having twins!  <br>  <br>  On another note, it would be cool in some ways to be a bit further though;)  I wouldn't mind.  <br>  <br>  Congrats and blessings :)|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think this nurse has an opinion that really means nothing.  She has no basis to make that judgement.  When you go for your ultrasound, that will be what determines how far along you are.  Have you considered multiples??  I think that you will feel better after you have your ultrasound.|`|TuRO6QHlaa	Maybe you are eating to much! Plus that is bs that the nurse is talking to you like that you can not look at a person and say oh she is suck and such along we all grow different I would find a new doctor. ONe that doesn't make you feel like crap!|`|XrKviWgSaa	you might have had a period and still be pregnant, that happened with my sister.|`|AvY7Rwvraa	I didn't find out that I was pregnant until 6 wks. So it could be possible that you have a further along pregnancy. But remember that some women can still have normal bleeding throughout their pregnancy. I have a few friends that have had this happen to them as well. The sonogram will show you the truth! Don't stress about it too much just think of it as having the baby sooner than what you thought.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	You could just be extra bloated.. Unless you continued to have periods when you were first pregnant, and didn't know you were.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Oh honey, first things, you can't tell how long someone is just by looking at them.... TRUST ME :)<br>  I was full term with my daughter and the staff at the hospital rushed me upstairs thinking i was going into premature labor because i was so tiny. <br>  I am now 23 weeks along and have just now even began to get a bumpp although my son is measuring out at over a pound.<br>  <br>  All womens' bodies are different, and the only way you are going to know how far along you are really is to have the ultrasound done. If your doctor was/is really worried that you are further along than you are they should have scheduled you an ultrasound soon.<br>  <br>  (and also, i found out i was pregnant with my son right around 4 weeks too!) <br>  Good luck in your pregnancy|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	How big were you measuring?

bYtCfdwbaa	As long as she is thriving,gaining weight,content and appears well then LUCKY YOU!|`|RmFVYkxeaa	My son was the same until he was 9 weeks old! He was induced at 36.5 weeks. I had to wake him for feeds and then he wasn't feeding effectively. Thankfully I had my midwife still visiting or calling me every day until he was 6wks old - because he ended up back in hospital. Does she have a wet nappy before every feed? Is it clear, and not yellow urine? Is baby's fontanel (soft spot) sunken? These are all signs she might not be getting enough milk and gaining weight properly. Since your baby was a premmie I'd take her to get checked out by the clinic nurse or your paediatrician. Don't expect her to be awake a bit more until she is closer to 2 months old = adjusted age - so 2 months after your due date. But the fact that you have to fight with her to get her to feed is a real worry - please get her checked out : )|`|2LflHv23aa	My friend had the same problem wither her daughter. She was born at 27 weeks. For the first 6 weeks home she had set her clock to go off every couple of hours. You have to be persistent and follow you baby's lead also. Babies that young still need lots of sleep about 18 hours a day. Have you tried to tickle her foot to stimulate her? I wouldn't worry about the loud noises not bothering her. The NICU is a very noisy place from what my friend told me. Her daughter never responded to loud noises since she was use to that already. When she reaches about 8 weeks corrected age she should wake herself up and be more active. I hope I have helped. Good luck and congrats.|`|6fiYhtACaa	From what I know about preemies this is normal- under normal circumstances she,d still be in utero now. Preemies are usually quiet until 40 weeks when they normally would have been born. I'm surprised that no one told you this. If you're concerned, however, that something might be wrong, take her to your pediatrician.

807312f4afa51e92aae2ac31c98a8b77aa	I don't know if my custody case is anything like yours, but I'd love to share it with you. I share custody of my brother--age 11-- with my step-father. After my mom and step-dad decided to divorce, my mom decided she wanted to be 'free'. She wanted to live the life she never could having a small child around. My brother stayed with me for 7 days straight, and then would live with my step-dad for 7 days. This happened for almost a year before we took her to court for custody. Of course in the year that she didn't see him, she still collected $1400 a month in child support. That was the only reason she fought for him, so she could still pocket the money. In the end, the judge awarded my step-dad and I joint custody. She has no rights what-so-ever and it took her almost 8 months to make her first visitation. I do allow her supervised visitation, and I really and truly do hope that she'll be able to make up for lost time.|`|Roui5iT5aa	why just visitation? why not joint custody?|`|phyttAf3aa	Visitation can vary greatly from one case to another. Depends upon how involved the other parent wants to be.  I would start by asking your (soon to be) ex how much visitation they want and see if that's something you think is reasonable.  You might be surprised with their answer - but you have to ask to get a starting point to negotiate with.
FIyPbVipaa	The best thing I can tell you because me and my Hubby have been trying for 7 months now, on average only 20% of couples conceive monthly Which isn't alot. I suggest mycycle.com to track your cycle. Once you sign up which is free. It will slow you to put in your dates that your period started. It will also show you what days your fertile and what day you should be ovulating. Everyone is different. Do this monthly.  Also something you can do yourself is watch your discharge. It's your cervical fluid. Depending on the discharge it can tell you when your going to ovulated. If it is sticky and can be stretched more than an inch or two that's the best fluid to conceive on as it helps with moving the sperm.    Best of luck|`|pYhYHQ2Oaa	Use this site askdramy.com<br>  It has a fertility calculator and tells u exactly when you ovulating.It worked for my sister!
oHNrktxTaa	We have a similar cycle:)) My length could be from 24-26 days. I usually tend to ovulate day 11 & 12. I would suggest you try 11, 12, 13, & 14.<br>  <br>  A menstrual calendar is a useful guide to follow.<br>  <br>  Also, did you ever try using Clear Blue Easy digital OPK sticks? They are very easy to use. It will help you to determine your LH surge (lutenizing hormone) prior to ovulation. When you get a positive, it is detecting a hormone which is close to the time you ovulate. This is the best time to TTC. <br>  <br>  Good luck & have fun!!|`|FIyPbVipaa	go to fertilityfriend.com or mycycle.com.  I have joined both and both are free.

Everyone is differnet so it's hard to say it alleepends on your cycle length
1thzSbS8aa	Yes, you can ovulate early. Or late. Your ovaries only respond to hormone levels, not dates on a calendar. <br>  <br>  Some women get little cramps during ovulation. The vast majority don't. The only other signs of ovulation are the ones you have to look for, like a raised basal body temperature and cervical mucus that looks and feels like egg whites.<br>  <br>  Your chances of pregnancy are about one in five.<br>  <br>  You need to wait until at least March 15 to test, and even that may be too early to trust a negative result.|`|8RfmosODaa	Good question! You can test when your period would be due if you dont get it.|`|6L9jJnchaa	You can take a test when you miss your period.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	It is a possibility that you are pregnant. Not to worry you or anything. It is possible to ovulate early, technically no one knows the exact moment of ovulation. Some signs of ovulation are an increased basal body temp. or cervical mucus. I would not take a test until you miss your next period, because you might not get a correct result. I know it's hard to wait that long, but you might get a false negative. Hope that helps!|`|9zwSclnLaa	Every time you have sex you can get pregnant, I don't know if you can ovulate 3 days early but this is why you should always wear a condom if you don't want a baby.  Take a pregnancy test after your missed period or 3-4 weeks after unprotected sex.|`|lTsPX04jaa	well hello if you had unprotected sex then yes you probably are pregnant|`|Rx31LHjbaa	Sperm can survive in the female body for quite some time - newer research actually suggests up to to 7 days, so yes,  it is possible to become pregnant if you have sex a few days before you ovulate.  You may not ovulate exactly on schedule anyway.  <br>  <br>  The soonest you can test depends on what kind of test you buy.  For example, with a First Response test you may be able to get a result 4 days before your missed period, but the accuracy rate this early is only 69%.  A negative test this early doesn't really mean anything.  Other test don't claim to be accurate until the first day of your missed period.  Just check the box to see for sure.|`|HjPPj4Kzaa	i dont know about ovulating early biut sperm can live up to seven days inside and you can get pregnant.<br>  you have like a white discharge when you ovulate.<br>  you can test ten days after you conseive but only if the test is really good. if i were you i would test on the 15th at a planned parenthood cause there tests are beter and are free.<br>  good luck with whatever you want the results to be|`|Qhyovyj8aa	Sperm live in the body for up to 5 days-or more.

deIzFnV8aa	1-2 oz is actually more than a lot of people get when they start pumping.  You should expect to see that increase to maybe 3-4 oz soon.<br>  <br>  If you have time, the best way to increase your supply is to pump more often for several days, since your body works on a supply and demand principle. You should be pumping at least as often as you are giving a bottle.  Your milk peaks in the middle of the night, so the best time to pump is in the morning, first thing if you are able.<br>  <br>  Are you pumping exclusively? If not, nursing frequently is another great way to increase supply, since babies are more efficient than pumps.<br>  <br>  Another issue withi pumping is letdown. Warm compresses or a warm shower will help more milk come out.  ALso, many people use vizulization, like looking at a pic of baby or picturing a waterfall of milk in their heads. It sounds silly, but apparently can really work.<br>  <br>  Please try not to be frustrated - I think it is usually hard at first but gets better quickly, I can't remember what I did at first, but I'm pretty sure in a few weeks I was able to pump almost a bottle worth per pumping session.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The amount you pump is not related to how much your baby would be getting if you are nursing her.  They are totally different processes.  Why are you pumping?  My suggestion, based on a bad experience similar to yours, is to put the pump away and nurse the baby more frequently.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumping_decrease.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...</a><br>  Most moms who are nursing full-time are able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Moms who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many moms think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is an unusually large pumping output.<br>  <br>  It is quite normal to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/maintainsupply-pump.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/mainta...</a><br>  When should mom start pumping?<br>  <br>      * If baby does not nurse immediately postpartum, mom should begin pumping within 6 hours of baby's birth -- starting early makes a difference for future milk production.<br>  <br>  What pump is best?<br>  <br>      * If baby is not nursing, seriously consider renting a hospital-grade pump (such as those made by Ameda or Medela) that will allow you to pump both breasts at the same time. A hospital-grade pump is the best choice for maintaining or increasing milk supply.<br>      * If you are not able to rent a hospital-grade pump, consider buying a pump (preferably a quality double pump) and/or hand expression.<br>  <br>  How much milk should mom be pumping if baby is not nursing?<br>  <br>      * Aim for pumping 750-800 mL (25-27 oz) per day by 7-10 days postpartum. If you have twins or higher order multiples, aim for pumping 800-950 mL (27-32 oz) by 14 days postpartum.<br>      * It's useful to evaluate mom's 24 hour pumping output at 10 days. If supply is borderline (350-500 ml / 11-17 oz) or low (less than 350 ml / 11 oz), then galactagogues (prescription meds or herbs to increase supply) or other interventions should be considered.<br>      * The research tells us that milk production at 2 weeks is an indicator of breastfeeding outcome, so it is important to get a good start. Even if milk production doesn't start out well, however, don't get discouraged--many moms will see an increase (even as late as 9-15 weeks after birth) if they continue with regular pumping.<br>  <br>  How often should mom pump?<br>  <br>      * 8-10 times per day: Until supply is well established, it is important to get at least eight good nursing and/or pumping sessions per 24 hours. Ten sessions per day is better, particularly if you have twins or higher order multiples.<br>      * These sessions don't need to be evenly spaced, but you should be nursing/pumping at least once during the night in the first few months or anytime you notice a decrease in supply. Avoid going longer than 5-6 hours without pumping during the first few months.<br>      * When pumping during the night, milk yield tends to be better if you pump when you naturally wake (to go to the bathroom or because your breasts are uncomfortably full) than if you set an alarm to wake for pumping.<br>      * If you are having a hard time getting in enough pumping sessions, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency even if milk is not removed thoroughly) is helpful.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/bfnotwk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/b...</a><br>  A woman's breasts will release most of their stored milk in about a 10-20 minute "window." Be prepared to pump for about 20 minutes per breast every 2-3 hours, with one 4-5 hour stretch once a day (often at night), just as the baby would nurse. Do not allow milk to remain in the breast for more than 6 hours at any time, because the retained milk will signal the cells to slow down production. Double pumping cuts total time but does not speed up the rate of release of milk. 3. Each woman is different. Some women's' breasts will "dump" milk quickly, while other breasts release milk more slowly. Breast storage capacity differs, too, and may be somewhat related to size. A small-breasted woman may need to pump more often than a woman with more glandular tissue and more storage capacity. Most women usually use only a small portion of their mammary tissue to make milk for one baby. Breast surgery can affect milk supply.4. The milk-producing cells settle into a production rate that maintains total volume about 15-20% over the baby's needs (or average amount removed) per day. To increase total volume per day, add more pumping sessions so that the breasts are "emptied" more often and more thoroughly. To decrease total volume, allow more milk retention. It takes 1-4 days for the breasts to respond to different "demands." 5. Maintain your supply about 15-20% above the baby's needs. This means you will be able store (freeze) a little bit each day over what the baby takes. If the baby takes all you are pumping and you need to use the stored milk, assume the baby is experiencing a growth spurt. The baby would have nursed VERY FREQUENTLY for a few days to boost supply, so mimic this pattern with your pumping regimen. Pump every 1 ? to 2 hours for a few days until supply increases.6. What you eat and drink has VERY LITTLE effect on milk volume or composition. Additional fluids affect bladder function, not milk supply. A good diet and sufficient fluids will help you feel better and stay healthy. While a few substances can affect milk volume, the single most important factor in milk supply is regular removal of milk. 7<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mother-2-mother.com/ExclusivePumping.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mother-2-mother.com/Exclusive...</a><br>  A normal newborn baby nurses on average 8 to 12 times in a 24 hour period. Most experts suggest it is best if mom can come close to matching what the normal nursing baby would do at the breast, and recommend she pump about every two hours, not going longer than three hours between sessions. Understanding how milk production works can help moms in their efforts to establish good milk supply. The more frequently the breasts are emptied, the more milk mother should have. Therefore, if she were to pump at least every 3 hours, for about 20 minutes, she should establish and maintain a good milk supply. In the first couple of weeks, she may also want to pump at least twice at night, but not all mothers do this.<br>  <br>      "It's insanely hard in the beginning but you need to pump every 2 to 3 hours around the clock. Prolactin levels (the hormone that tells your body to make milk) are highest in the early morning hours so mom would want to make sure she is pumping then as well. This is like the 1am to 5am stretch of time. If mom can at least get one pump in during this time, it will really help.<br>  <br>      The main concern is to get enough pumps in per day - a minimum of 7 pumps per day. I will say from experience that when I pushed myself to get in 8 pumps per day, my supply REALLY increased. Most of the time, I just couldn't push myself and ended up with 7 times. And to create a little bit of sanity, it is the number of pumps per day that you get in and not necessarily the amount of time you wait in between pumps that counts. So, if I needed to run an errand or just wanted to get out of the house without dragging my pump along, I would pump every 2 hours in the morning and then have a window of about 4 or 5 hours in the afternoon to do everything and would then pump again every 2 hours in the evening to get my total of 7 pumps in for the day.<br>  <br>      That being said, I did NOT get up to pump in the middle of the night if my baby wasn't awake. I thought that was cruel and couldn't do it! Ha! The sleep was more important to me (especially after the c-section). A lot of pumping is trial and error and this is why keeping info in a spreadsheet (or journal) is helpful. If you start sleeping through the night or going longer stretches and see a huge decline in your volume, you can always set you alarm to add another pump back in. I never had to but this can vary from mom to mom. I did the early morning pump as long as I was up feeding the baby, but if she slept 5 hours through the night, so did I! "|`|DLDweOcYaa	I had the same problem.  I was only able to pump 250ml per day.  I thought I was running out of milk but I read in one of my parenting books that just becaause you don't pump enough milk doesn't mean that you are running out.  I put my daughter on formula at 10 weeks of age because I thought I didn't have enough milk.  I know better for the next time.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	If u want more milk pump more also take fenugreek and freeze what u don't use.
I8lFqyyFaa	You put a stop to it under no uncertain terms, and bring whatever consequences that are usually expected in your house to bear.  Depending on his age, maybe you have a disscussion about what sexual harassment is, and how it's never acceptable.   You do your best to help him see how this can only hurt his sister in a lasting personal way (like if she were to publicly find a way to point to and demonstrate his small penis repeatedly,) and make it clear no one finds this even slightly funny.  And get to the bottom of why he would want to injure her in this way - what is he so angry at his sister for?  There may be more than one of your offspring misbehaving.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	slip him a dollar and buy him a pole|`|BpYwAwIOaa	Tell him that's inappropriate behavior and punish him if he doesn't quit his taunting. be a adult about this because you child seems to enjoy his sisters misery.|`|djuRlggeaa	34B and only NINE???! okayyy.. tell him to stop. punish him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my question please...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnCyH6_k_jy9OXyzW0SY3.Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304154832AAqFtZE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  thanks if ya answer!|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Stop teasing your sister? <br>  9 and in bras already!

cCXGEZxaaa	Most places do like to hire 16+ but with experience and CPR and First Aid training you shouldn't have too much trouble. Parent's love hiring CPR certified teens to babysit so day cares should be of the same I would think.<br>  Best of luck.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	I have a feeling that most daycare centers wouldn't hire someone under 18 to work with kids. Almost all the ones I've been to in the past and applied to required someone at least over 18. I think it has something to do with the liability of working with other people's children and if one of their employees is underage and should something happen to a child in their care.... well the company could lose their daycare license, have a huge lawsuit, or worse. but that's just worse case scenario. It's worth a shot going to different daycares in your area. At your age though I'd probably just stick to babysitting.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Okay, first off, don't answer the question "Where do you live?"  that is dangerous.  Simply search around your area for daycares that are hiring and ask them :)|`|2vidb5ZAaa	I def. think you are too young.<br>  <br>  In most places in my area you need to be 18.|`|ffnne6O1aa	Try getting a job at a kid's store like Build a Bear if you like working with kids. You won't be able to get one at a daycare.|`|0be2fe08ce298863b7b8d7b8ccc0b8a9aa	what about a YMCA|`|kHcU1WToaa	Well its good that you've taken the CPR and F/A classes, but i don't think day cares hire at 15. You have to be at least 18 to work in any childcare center (pre-school,day care etc) If i were you, and if you really want to pursue a career in childcare see if you have any vocational schools in your district. I am attending a voca school and am taking early childhood education, and i work in a preschool. If you are just looking to make some money, then i would look into going into food services or something (i know i know it sucks) depending on where you are i don't know a lot of places that will hire at 15, i know some places do hire at 15 1/2. But mostly its 16...don't worry about getting a job right now anyway dude. Enjoy school, and have fun being a kid :D|`|iF7IffGTaa	Chances are they won't hire you because you don't have a ECE diploma. You can volunteer to play with kids.<br>  <br>  EDIT- When your entrusting your child's life for 10 bucks or more an hour....THEY better have a early child hood education diploma, safety training, and a criminal record check. These places know this...|`|4Ld1GqnZaa	Hmm, you could have a little babysitting service of your own and put an ad in the newspaper or something.  I don't know if any large companies would hire you or not, but it's worth a shot!|`|KSfK4qR1aa	minors cant supervise minors.<br>  <br>  theres even laws about it in a household let alone in the working world<br>  <br>  sorry, just wait 1 year|`|XXiTOmpbaa	Its called Lil Traphouse.

Fsr2Rofzaa	well it could be.  But usually the mucus plug is more dense, but still goopy and slimey.  Usually you'll lose the plug over a few days in big blobs, you can esp. notice this when you use the rest room.  But then again I have heard ppl only having one big blob of goop and that was it. Sometimes when the mucus comes out it may be pinkish from blood, which is normal.|`|TuRO6QHlaa	Did you see this when you got home or at the office? The goop is not normally stringy but idk she might have said something if it was and she noticed it there, but if you saw it at home there really shouldn't be leftover goop so it prolly was your plug

6437b75256a604b778a56285f6911a4daa	I'm a repaired Tet and am 53 years old.  There are lots of ToFers in the Adult Congenital Heart Association (<a href="http://www.achaheart.org)." rel="nofollow">http://www.achaheart.org).</a>  My original repair was in 1960 and I went 42 years until my next heart surgery where they replaced my pulmonary valve, among other things. My advice to you is to get and keep a copy of your son's medical records... they may come in handy when he gets older.  Mine sure did.<br>  <br>  I have lived a normal life, getting a BS, MS, and PhD, and have had a long technical and marketing career at a couple of large corporations and a startup.  Your son has every opportunity for a long and happy life (but make sure that he sees an adult congenital cardiologist when he grows up).|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My nephew was diagnosed with it when he was born also.  He had the surgery, and made a complete recovery.  He is now just a regular 8 year old boy, with a couple of small scars.  Your little boy will be fine.  It's great that your being strong.  He will need that for his recovery.  Years from now when he's out with his friends comparing scars, he'll have some pretty neat ones to show off!|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	I've seen several children with excellent results for repair of TOF. In my early career, the surgeons initially did a Blaylock-Taussig procedure until the infant grew older, then did the primary repair.
ASH6fsmoaa	2 1/2 hours is a long time for a 3 year old's b'day party. I would cut it back to 4 or 4:30 then its far enough away from dinner time that you could just serve snacks. I took my children to a party recently that finished at 5 and didn't serve food (except goldfish and cake) and by the time we got home it was 5:30 and I had to make something for dinner. I'd presumed that there would be pizza or something at the party since it finished at 5 (it started at 3:30)|`|e3b8b825895e40fb941cd8e7d2ea18a0aa	I think that cake and ice cream is sufficient.  You could have some small snacks, veggies or cheese and crackers.  I definitely wouldn't provide a meal.  Make little goodie bags for the kids, check out your local "dollar" store.  It is great for things like this.|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	Appetizers are fine...I usually pick the same time frame so I don't have to have too much food out!|`|pTG1JuDbaa	only apps|`|1ezYfkX7aa	It depends what you want to do but the time of your party i am sure people will be hungry. I normally have my kids party from around 1-3 and serve cake, ice cream, chips, sometimes i do meatball sandwitches and throw the meatballs in a crock pot or i go buy rolls and lunchmeat and cheese and do sandwitches. Its totally up to you =)|`|e9YFTyzZaa	I think the appetizers & B'day cake will be FINE!<br>  Don't forget, getting close to 5pm is nearing dinnertime and I wouldn't be Surprised if some of the Parents picked up their children before 5.<br>  Nice idea, though!
0qP8gLpyaa	Last year my son was 1 on Easter. My husband and I just did an Easter basket for him that had a new sippy cup, a stuffed animal, a coloring book and some jumbo size crayons. We also found a story book about baby animals. For the sweets we put in some goldfish and teddy grahams in little packets and a package of fruit snacks.   He loved it!<br>  <br>  Some other good ideas for a 1 year old:<br>  * rubber ducky for the tub<br>  * a summer hat and some sunglasses for infant/toddler <br>  * some bubbles<br>  * side walk chalk - my son started using it around a year old outside and he loved it! He still loves to scribble with chalk outside on nice days! <br>  <br>  <br>  This year will be a little more because he's into different things and can do different things this year.  We still limit the candy. I got a little milk chocolate bunny that is about 4 inches and just perfect size for a 2 year old at Walgreens.  I also got him an Easter themed PEZ (Dollar tree has these right now and they are the real PEZ, not a cheap copy).<br>  <br>  We do go to an egg hunt each year at a family members house (MIL does one for all the kids in her neighborhood and the family kids every year) and color eggs. Usually we just dye the eggs and our son puts little easter stickers on them. When he's big enough to help with the actual dye part we'll forgo the stickers and let him dye his own set of eggs.  <br>  <br>  You could make jello eggs. Little kids love those and they are fun to eat. <br>  <br>  I also usually make some Easter cut out sugar cookies in the shape of flowers and eggs for my son to decorate. He likes helping out- even if the cookies aren't the most beautiful looking when he's done he still loves to do it and share them. :)|`|AA11537580	sing some songs<br>  color some eggs<br>  make her a bunny cake<br>  do an Easter egg hunt<br>  go to church<br>  help her make some easter cards/crafts|`|zqsUBtHHaa	well I think that you should go to a public easter egg hunt or (my mom let me do this when i was younger) get all her little friends from the neighborhood and have a SMALL easter party heres a list of things you will need for a easter party.<br>  1. unpeeled boiled eggs<br>  2. little plastic eggs<br>  3. spare change (or candy)<br>  4. baskets<br>  5. egg die (or you can use water and food coloring and just dip the eggs in that<br>  <br>                                 what to do <br>  1. fill the little plastic eggs with the spare change (or candy) and spred them across the yard then let your daughter and friends look for them<br>  2. let the kids die the unpeeled eggs whatever color<br>  3. hide the eggs and let the kids look for them<br>  4. have the kids peel the eggs and eat the eggs|`|x3fQP9viaa	A book about animals, like a touch and feel.

TQW5E6olaa	Nope!! Between the experiences my friends are I have all had in Mexico on previous vacations 10 years ago (Assault/hostage situations w/ hospitals/ horrible accidents/etc), I'll never go again and I wouldn't want Bella going either.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	I saw a news story that says the State Dept and colleges are advising students to NOT go to Mexico during Spring Break.  As the parent of college-aged kids, I'm glad that the colleges are showing concern. With the way things are right now there, I can see why parents would be very nervous about that. That's only natural. You want your children to be safe, even when the children are legal adults who have the right to decide what they want to do.<br>  <br>  Yet on the other hand, you might want to keep in mind that bad things can happen anywhere...even here in the USA in cities and small towns with low crime rates that are normally considered "safe."<br>    <br>  Someone here mentioned Natalee Holloway, but one should also keep in mind that Brooke Willberger disappeared from a small Oregon college town...far, far away from Mexico and the Caribbean.  Last month, a man opened fire on several high school students waiting in front of a Portland, Oregon night club. One of the dead was a South American exchange student. Should we now say don't travel to Oregon because of these two incidents?<br>  <br>  Phoenix, AZ just got listed as the #1 kidnap capital in the US due to the spillover from the Mexican drug wars, and places like San Diego, New Mexico and Texas have been trouble spots for that, too. Most of the time, though, the kidnappings have involved people who are either illegal immigrants and/or actively involved in the drug trade. <br>  <br>  It's good to be aware of what's going on, but also to be careful of sensationalizing or taking an attitude that all the bad stuff will probably happen to us.  If we had to worry about every negative thing that could happen in  life, most of us would never leave our homes...and what kind of life would that be?  I would say it's good to talk to your daughter about your concerns, but in the end realize if she's over 18,  it's her right to decide whether or not to travel.  <br>  <br>  The opportunity to travel outside the USA can be a very enriching and enjoyable one, and maybe she feels like you only live once and she just doesn't want to miss out on the fun with her friends. That's natural for most young people to feel that way. I felt that way as a youth, and from the age of 16, I took every opportunity I could to travel...even to so-called 'dangerous' areas...and yes, sometimes I traveled alone.<br>  <br>  I'm now 48 and none the worse for wear.<br>  <br>  I would say much will depend on where in Mexico she's going and who she will be traveling with.  There are still tourist areas in Mexico that are quite safe like Cancun and Cozumel.  I'd advise staying away from the state of Sinaloa and Baja California Norte or the cities of Tijuana,  Nogales or Ciudad Juarez.  As long as your daughter and her travel companions use their common sense and follow the guidelines listed at the state dept website (see link below), they'll be ok.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I think it is acceptable to take a *family* vacation to certain spots, Cancun, etc.  I do not think it is okay to let a teen or very young adult to go galavanting around into another country (particularly one having such problems) with little or no supervision.<br>  <br>  And I say this because I went to college in a school close to the border in Texas.  We partied in Mexico a lot.  Looking back now...probably one of the stupidest and most unsafe choices I've ever made in my life.|`|KGRikkJeaa	I would let my son go (hes only 2, im talking future). You only get to live life once ya kno? If something should happen then I would brace myself and say that it is God's will what will happen to my son IF anything happens. he has plans for us, if i was to die in a car crash, then that is the way god wanted me to go, better than my dad saying" i should have never bought her a car" so yea...no regrets|`|LwbwMFX9aa	NO way in hell my kids would ever go, remember natalie holloway
nfzQkvqraa	I laughed at your pregnant hamster part.  Is that horrible of me?<br>  <br>  I would say no to anything that I wouldn't personally take care of.  Because once the excitement wears off I'm the one feeding and cleaning up the poop.  I would say no to snakes I think.<br>  <br>  We did have a frog once.  He died because I forgot to buy him crickets.  Thank God I'm better with kids than pets.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  AWESOME we're even.  Thanks for making me laugh..AGAIN with the cricket reference!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Yes. My children are not allowed to have rodents either. Plain and simply, they smell. <br>  <br>  They are also not allowed to have fish. When my daughter really wanted a fish tank, she talked my mom into letting her have one at their house. So, it went well for about a month, then it was neglected and never cleaned. One day my mom "accidently/on purpose" unplugged the tank before a vacation. Well, the house got a little warm and the fish boiled. The smell was awful. So, no fish for me.<br>  <br>  Also, I am the biggest baby when it comes to snakes. I won't even get near them when they are in a glass case.|`|ko3Larigaa	my mom barely allows any pets and we dont even live with her where with our dad but she controls the thing lol. but we have had many cats and now at my house we only have one my little baby Calii Ace- Girl<br>  <br>  I had 2 hamsters both died and now she wont let us have anymore because she hates knowing they died<br>  <br>  and My neighbors gave me a mouse but it died to so she said no more rodents <br>  <br>  she wont let us have a puppy even tho she wants one too <br>  <br>  and yea after her decisions and your reasoning I think that yours are fair and Im 14.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	no spiders<br>  <br>  we have a cat, a dog, and two stinky ferrets. we had a couple of lizards, rats, and hampsters.<br>  <br>  rats and cats are the easiest to care for. i DO NOT reccomend ferrets unless you like having a uncontrolable stink hanging around all the time. (although they are cute).|`|aCUHzMrmaa	The suggested categories crack me up.  I'm allergic to cats too but my kids love them so we have 3....bleh.  I wouldn't let them have a pitbull. I love dogs ( we also have a yellow lab), but pitbulls can be pretty psycho and i think their the #1 dog to attack.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	No insects<br>  <br>  Hamsters are evil... I worked in a pet store and those buggers like to bite way to much and they stink. <br>  <br>  We have a dog ( little mixed breed mutt) and 4 fat lazy cats and a 180 gallon fish tank. I think that is enough anyways! lol|`|rpsXPdFmaa	Snakes!  Snakes and tarantulas!  Uuuugh, both are so icky and creepy.  I'd rather a rodent than one of those.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Mine are about the same as yours. We aren't going to let our kids get a lion or bear or anything...but otherwise yeah...we are both on the same track.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	any rots or pit bulls|`|dXLMDGqDaa	yes a snake|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I would draw the line at a snake, simply because I do NOT want dead mice in our freezer to find the snake with. Yuck. If I could get over the mouse thing I think I MIGHT be able to handle a snake as long as my husband was the one who helped the kids look after it. <br>  We've had so many different pets-right now we have 3 big dogs, 2 kittens (one is currently trying to eat my toe), a bird, a horse we keep stabled 30 mins away, and 5 horses we keep at my parents farm. In the past we've had rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, lizards, fish, frogs, we've  taken in injured hedgehogs, possums, squirrels, and when we were in Kenya, Botswana, Brazil, etc we took in monkeys, tiger cubs, jaguar cubs, an owl, lima's and plenty of other things-it makes me sad my 3 youngest kids never got to experience this, so I would go back there in a second.<br>  If we ever move I am so determined to move to Seattle, buy a house with land near my parents, so my kids can have all the animals they like (more horses, goats, cattle etc, I grew up on a farm and loved it).<br>  <br>  One pet we've never had is a turtle and I would love one!!! But yeah..I draw the line at a snake sorry!<br>  <br>  Ohh I wouldn't have any spiders or cockroaches either!! (We have enough living here already lol) but I hate them, and my eldest has a huge phobia of them and would never, ever sleep lol.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I don't let my kids have any pets.  We have tried that a couple of times.  First, was a fish.  I killed him on accident because we had a big ice storm and lost power for days and I forgot to get him out of the house.  We had a frog, but he died about a month ago, I think because our house wasn't the right temperature for him.....do you see the pattern here?  No pets for me!  LOL  I can't even keep the plants alive.|`|TQW5E6olaa	No rodents, no lizards, no kitties....no pitbulls<br>  <br>  I like fish, it's the only pet i'll encourage at this point|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Right now we can't have a dog because we rent.  The only animal I wouldn't allow is a reptile.  I had a lizard for 6 years and it took a ton of work and still wasn't very healthy.  So we won't be going down that road again.  Every hamster I ever owned bit me, so I'm wary of them.  My husband isn't a big fan of pets though, so he pretty much says only fish, cats, and dogs are allowed.|`|AA11210211	lol,I do not like Snakes,I am absolutely terrified of them,That is really the only one I wouldn't let my children have.I am a cat person myself,I have 2 of them.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  thank you MR. Wybie I won't let them have a pitbull either,My niece got bit by one one time when I was watching her when I was a teenager.|`|j2mRop0laa	Noooo rodents. no hamster, bunny, mouse, or oh gawd.....rat. <br>  <br>  Nothing like that. I'll have nightmares now.<br>  <br>  Oh and NO fish tank. We had one years ago that hubby cleaned constantly. One day we woke up and the entire glass was covered in tiny worms. Oh gawd. I completely freaked and scrubbed the whole house. I was so afraid. No fish.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Snakes! When the oldest was 3, I got him some hermit crabs (relatively low maintenance) but my son took one of my spice jars and dumped it inside it's shell and it died! I'm up for anything that can live outside.|`|wZAeBisbaa	We didn't let them have any pets that we weren't willing and able to care for ourselves, if necessary.  Since we didn't feel we had the time and attention to properly care for a dog, we never had one, although under other circumstances I would have liked a dog.<br>  <br>  We were perfectly fine with rodents and reptiles (though I didn't like feeding crickets to the lizard), because the kids did almost all of the work. Of course I would have drawn the line at large snakes or rare expensive lizards.   When we had gerbils and hamsters, we made sure they were all the same gender, in order to avoid exactly the situation you describe.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my whole family loves animals,  about the only thing i wouldnt let them have at aLL would be a snake.i can handle just about anything else...at the moment my daughter has a boer nanny goat that thinks its a dog and tries to sit in her lap and follows her around the yard like shes its  mama....its comical, but she loves that goat to death lol.|`|5p7gpj36aa	Birds.  I don't want to clean up after them, or her them all day either.  We do have a dog, used to have cats (even though I too am allergic), used to have a hamster that I killed by not giving it water (oops) and we have fish, and OOOOHHHH get ready .... a snake!   (Small corn snake!)|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	They can have anything but snakes, lizards & spiders. I will never classify those as 'pets'. <br>  <br>  We have a cat & a dog. I also plan to get a puppy this summer (I want a chocolate lab!)|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I'm a huge animal person so anything is fair game. I used to be terrified of tarantula's until I worked at a pet store.<br>  I wouldn't let me kids have snakes or lizards until they are old enough to be careful with them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Snakes would be an absolute NO in my book.. as well as rodents!|`|G9ywiLqvaa	HAMSTERS!  NEVER EVER EVER HAMSTERS!!!!<br>  <br>  we used to have a couple and in a span of a few months, we had 14!  FOURTEEN!!!!  those animals breed like...animals!  we started giving them away but still, those that were left, bred and bred and bred.  until finally, my husband gave them up to a pet shop.  geez, we wanted pets, not a community!<br>  <br>  we also had a duckling, a chick, and a love bird --which my youngest 'accidentally' killed or set free.  <br>  <br>  so now, we're stuck with 3 baby pythons in a glass tank.<br>  and i'm happy.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  hey, i'm the only one who likes snakes?  :(|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I would have to say those hissing cockroaches (people really do have them as pets) or a tarantula. <br>  <br>  I love all animals. I can deal with spiders, etc. I'd just prefer them not to be in the house. I would get them if my children really, really wanted them and proved they were responsible enough to take care of them but I'd rather get them a dog than a cockroach. <br>  <br>  I grew up with fish, mice, a hermit crab, turtle, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pig, rabbit, bird, cats, dogs, horse, etc. I love having big dogs the most and, one day, when I have a lot of acreage want to get a horse, chickens, etc.<br>  <br>  Oh, I would have to say I wouldn't get a snake either. I have nothing against them, I've held them and I'm good with them but I could never feed them the mice. My sister had a snake and I was disgusted when I saw the dead mouse thawing in the sink. I get that they have to eat but I feel so bad for the mice.
UbCzA2JVaa	I like it, though I prefer Marina.<br>  <br>  Mariana Rose sounds very pretty. She could be called:<br>  Mari<br>  Riana<br>  Ria<br>  Ana<br>  Ari<br>  Ariana<br>  Maria<br>  <br>  There are lots of possible nicknames!         :)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Mariana Rose is very pretty!  <br>  Nicknames:  Mari, Ana, Riana, Ri-Ro (as a baby)|`|8VaSOTfnaa	Love Love Love it.|`|lfcbi9cYaa	Mariana is a nice name.

You go girl! l0l<br>  And Mari would be a nickname.|`|eazdrgzHaa	Not really...its a combo of Maria and Ana, two of the most commonest hispanic names, and since i am hispanic, its kind of a common name too which is really boring but if you come from a white girl perspective i guess it would be pretty|`|AA11521906	if you like italian sausage in your ham wallet<br>  <br>  marinara sauce<br>  marlin<br>  martina mcgay<br>  martin<br>  marapple<br>  marck<br>  mark<br>  mako<br>  Macoroni<br>  Dick Cheney|`|4nuSg31Jaa	yeaa its nice
wr78BCGAaa	even though it's not an STD, it can still be transferred back and forth thru sex. if you have it and had sex, then your partner should be given a round of flagyl also... or he's just gonna keep giving it back to you.<br>  <br>  if it smells sour.. like bad milk... then it's not BV, it's tric. flagyl cures that also but it's very easily spread.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	I know that I am not going to be much help but I really think I may have BV also and I am almost 8 weeks preggo. I have had the same thing as you...yellow discharge, and spotting. I have had it ever since I found out I was pregnant at 5 weeks. The weird thing is this: I know that BV is not an STD but it seems like every time I have sex with my BF, I get it and it really sucks with the smell etc. Right now, I do have an odd smell but it is not like the normal BV smell I've had before. Its not a bad smell but I can smell it everywhere...down in my vaginal area, my hands, arms etc. So I don't know if that is the BV or if that is just me being pregnant and able to smell everything. <br>  Regardless, my first dr appt is today and I am going to ask her about it because it has been bothering me for the past few weeks.|`|NkjAqQWBaa	Yes, dont get upset about it. I went through the exact same thing a few weeks ago. I am 37 weeks, and I was FREAKING out. I had the same discharge, and the red stringy lines of blood in it. You will loose a little blood due to this, because like your doc said it irritates your cervix. I also had the cramping bad, and thought they were contractions.lol just wishful thinking. :p  Just keep taking whatever medicine your doc prescribed, and all will get better I promise. Good luck at your ultrasound!!!!  Oh yeah, and the doc told me that your hormones are up and down so much during pregnacy that it causes this. She said that every woman has this bacteria, but when your hormones start going crazy it causes the amout of bad bacteria to increase, and it causes you to get BV.|`|qej62zhDaa	I had it with both of my previous pregnancies. Everything turned out fine. I asked my doctor why did it keep reoccurring (because I've had it several times) and she said some people just keep getting it. But I really think it has something to do with the acidity of sperm messing up the Ph balance...
1WBimx1laa	Yes and it actually very good to work out while you are pregnant. You are more likely to lose the wieght alot faster than most people. I worked out and did crunches and walked until I was up to 8 months and I lost every bit of my baby wieght within 2 weeks after pregnancy. Keep up the good work.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	yes hun just not strenious ones|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most likely light aerobics but it's always best to check with your doctor.|`|aPscVrOoaa	You should be fine to keep up what your body is used to. Talk to your doctor at your visit. I ran a lot at the beginning of my pregnancy and the baby has been great. After the 4th month you just need to avoid laying flat on your back and in your 2nd tri you'll want to keep an eye on your heart rate (don't let it get over 140).
wiAVa1H5aa	Infants Motrin - it will help with the swelling.|`|0WASp0bHaa	10 to 1 she has an ear infection. very easy to get when flying. You can not give her any kind of sinus medication to relieve the pressure. <br>  Only baby pain relief medication. <br>  I would look up some care clinics by you. You may be running to the doctor. ear infections are very painful and need prescription medication|`|pNPJH1WBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I would try calpol or baby nurofen but it could be an ear infection. Keep an eye on her temperature. If it does not go away by tomorrow I would take her to the docs. Better to be safe and told it is nothing. My little one got loads of ear infections and it started with pulling ears and crying when you laid him down. If it is an infection they will need antibiotics.|`|w8l5yoPbaa	Nurofen for Children. Tell her to try this. I have used neurofen and it is extremely effective. If this does not help, try Tylenol for infants|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I would as a pharmacist

Some might go to the mall, some might play football. Some might go to the movies with their friends, others might be studying or doing charity work.

I wouldn't even get a dog if I didn't have a job.|`|u94HOVz7aa	the hospital has already said they will not release the babies unless she can prove she has a stable, safe home environment for them.  <br>  <br>  but please just move on already!|`|amUPPnuDaa	I think that she has some very strange ideas.|`|EeGgovyCaa	No they won't allow her to have them. There's no way she can prove to be in a stable environment.|`|KGRikkJeaa	i agree with Twin Mum...|`|0818EVcWaa	I think that she was being a little irresponsible by having all of those children but I think that she was just so lonely in her life and wanted someone to be there with her. I mean, she did say that she is the only child and she always wanted children around so I guess this is why she wants so many children. I personally don't have anything bad to say about her because she strikes me as a loving mother who has a good heart. Yeah, she may have spent money on her looks but if that's what she wants to do then that's fine since she got the money from a settlement because of some injury she got from her job. I know people keep saying that they don't want to support her and her kids but I think that people need to have a heart and forgive her for her mistakes. I mean, I would definitely help her if I had the money! Also, I'm sick of people saying that they need to call child protective services on her. She hasn't proven that she's an unfit mother and I really don't believe that she is. This sort of reminds me of my grandma who had 9 children. I'm thinking of how she would have felt if people tried to take my mother, aunts and uncles away from her.....that wouldn't make her feel very good. So, before you guys judge her and say that she's unfit, please learn a little more about her.|`|59821ioeaa	This lady sickens me. First she should not have had more children since she cant support the ones she already has. Second I think there should be a law passed that if you are on welfare and have more kids you should not be able to collect more money, thats just stupid, keep your legs CLOSED. Third, the dr should loose his license or have to contribute something instead of the tax payers, is this guy stupid...she cant afford her children why would you give her a chance to have more???? I could go on and on all day about this woman, the only people i feel bad for are her children, to be in this situation is sad for them and innocent little ones should not have to go through this. And the tax payers of course, we are out here trying to support our kids and our selves and its very hard in this time.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	She must be delusional. This story is absoultely outrageous. How unfair to the babies, the 6 other children, Nadya's parents, and the entire state of California! The fertility doctor should lose his license- if he hasn't already.<br>  <br>  they should probably consider foster care for ALL the children until she can prove herself more stable.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I agree that she has too many kids but honestly I wish everyone would leave her and her kids alone.  The media always makes people look bad than they already are.  No one really knows what her home life is really like.  I do agree that CPS should be involved but only to help her not take her kids away.<br>  <br>  Edit: To Thinks for herself.  I never had the guts to say that and I totally agree with you.  People don't know her.  They only makes comments because of how the media portrays her.  If I lived in the US I would make every attempt to help her.|`|bcc6974af9d8a8440bae6eb42a99b0e9aa	Thats chick is nuts. I don't think she should have custody of ANY of the 14 til she gets herself some help.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	As soon as I flipped through the channels and saw her on Dr. Phil I changed the channel. Ugh. Other than that, my opinion of her really hasn't changed much since the other 18,924 questions about her were already asked on here. Sorry. <br>  <br>  But yes, perhaps a CT Scan would be beneficial...!
iisbgn17aa	Okay a slogan could be like 'trick or treat, watch what you eat!' with like a picture of a little kid in a costume having a candy apple with a razor blade in it. The poster could be like black & orange for Halloween, good luck!<br>  <br>  Love Sienna<3|`|6L9jJnchaa	It's March.  Halloween is 7 months away.  Lol.|`|90nnM99Paa	something like "you may be tricked, so check your treats!" orrr...

x7WphuY5aa	GO GET TO IT you are ovulating if you have EWCM get busy no matter what the date is mother nature doesn't care why do you think you are irregular BABY DUST|`|o1yy6KABaa	Yes you could be ovualting...get off the computer and do more BDing!! ;) <br>  <br>  Baby dust to you!
DMsjoZwSaa	I'd just like to respond to the person that said if you have a period you aren't pregnant...<br>  <br>  I'm six months pregnant and have had a period every,-single-month. It's not too rare to be bleeding while pregnant, especially if you've had irregular periods. <br>  <br>  Make a Dr's appointment, ASAP and ask for a blood test! The sooner you can figure out if you're pregnant or not, the sooner you can get on pre-natals! <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|usvsdELYaa	Take a test if you do not want a child then to be honest you should not be having unprotected sex.|`|EJl2RvDfaa	take a test its been over a month and if you haven't had a period you could be pregnant.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	Was your period after you had sex? If so, then you aren't preggo! You are most fertile somewhere around 2 weeks after your period. When did you have sex? Right after your period is almost impossible to get pregnant and it is also impossible a few days before your period. I amnot saying to go by that, but just things to think about and remember! Get on the pill!<br>  <br>  EDIT- NO, you can't get pregnant the day before your period, girl! It is not when you are most fertile. How old are you?|`|DiuDO1Weaa	take a test hun when you period is due or you can take one 5 daqys before your period good luck hun|`|sfRGKWpCaa	just try a pregnancy test!<br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  :D<br>  <br>  REMEMBER USE CONDOMS!!|`|EZdHWa4taa	Maybe you should consult a doctor, or take a test?|`|a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	I would advice you take a test because there is a real strong possibility as im sure u are aware that u r pregnant and the symptoms could certinaly indicate that however it might be just a pre period signs u have..<br>  <br>  If that last time you had unprotected sex was 14 days or so again then its safe to take a test now with an accurate result... or go to your Dr as he could do some bloods to find out..<br>  <br>  Good luck and its a good attitude to have to take responsibilty for your actions...<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you i really do|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you had a period you aren't pregnant....|`|pIBOSkfsaa	If you had the unprotected sex, before your period this month i really wouldn't worry about it. All you need to do is wait and see if you get your period, Good luck be careful<br>  <br>  -You are most fertile on or around day 15 or your cycle (day 1 being the day you get your period) if you had sex the day before your period it is unlikely of being pregnant , (the train has already left the station so to speak, ((the train being the egg and the station being the fullopian tube))
7rCeCVl2aa	I know I read some of the answers and my jaw almost drops. I can't believe that people actually do/try some of the things I read with their kids.... Some of the questions strike me too because I think, "Isn't that just common sense?" Then again we all don't think alike either... How boring would that be?<br>  <br>  Sometimes I really get in to an answer and pour my heart out and when I don't get best answer I don't take it too personal. It probably just didn't appeal to the person.|`|EeGgovyCaa	EDIT: Ah okay. LOL! I read that sentence like three times it wasn't making sense to me :). Thanks Noah's mommy. It's friday! <br>  <br>  I don't really care what people think about what I type on here. What is true to me may not be for them. Reasons being living in a different kind of environment or country. Everyone was raised differently, and they reflect that onto their own kids.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I think a lot of the time when someone says "my doctor said," there statements tend to be false. Like "my Dr said to let my 2 week old cry it out," or "my DR said to put cereal in my 3 day old's bottle to sleep better." I try to ignore it but sometimes I have to call people out :)|`|z6IekuwSaa	Lol, I know what you mean. I was appalled when somone said breastmilk is toxic. LOL, it was chosen as best answer. So rediculous, I mean hell-o, idiot!|`|N0N9FzEhaa	OMG! You were thinking!? bluenaketat2 Congratulations hun! We're making progress!|`|pXSKSS3daa	No, I haven't wondered, really.<br>  <br>  All my "stories" I include are factual, I see no point in lying about things especially to other mommies.<br>  <br>  ETA: momoftwins, the sentence made sense. She was basically saying that sometimes when she leaves an answer to someone's question she gets offended if she doesn't get best answer.<br>  <br>  ETA: Lol, you're welcome!
KeevlZnTaa	I don't think it is necessarily bad. However, I hope they keep her an energetic, self assured, confident character that makes choices to help others. I think the t.v has enough "pretty", "popular" girls that think shopping and boys are all there is to life, so if she stays out of that mold I think it is ok.<br>  <br>  I can completely see their reasoning for changing the character(from someone who has studies business and marketing). I new right away why they are choosing to change her, and it makes sense.<br>  <br>  She is no longer going to be an adventurer, but a middle schooler, living in the city. From what I heard they are keeping it a "mystery" solving show.<br>  <br>  She is no longer geared to preschoolers(which is why some parents are upset). Parents have to realize that her content is not going to be for 2-4 year olds anymore, and the fact that she has long hair and legs is b/c the target audience has changed. Preschoolers should not be watching the new Dora, it is not age appropriate anymore.<br>  <br>  I can personally see why Nickelodeon is trying this out, they see the dollar signs. Sexy, skinny, fashionable, etc dolls make money. They are hoping on the "Bratz"/New Brabie bandwagon and hoping to increase profit by having a niche in the industry of fashion dolls, which is more likely with a show attached to it. Dora is already know to people, therefore there is less need to advertise and introduce people to the character, which saves money. The controversy is even better(marketing wise), b/c it is free advertising on news and internet for the show.<br>  <br>  I personally see nothing wrong with making Dora older. Diego's show still has the same elements as Dora did, they were practically the same show(and in my opinion Diego was less annoying).|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I see nothing wrong with a variety of Dora toys. There are some really pretty Dora items where Dora has longer hair and pretty dresses and I think they look really nice. <br>  <br>  Dora is 7. 7 year olds have longer legs. Hair grows. Anyone who has seen Dora would know she is a 7 year old who goes on long unsupervised walks while her parents are at work... past mountains, over rickety old bridges that always fall apart right before she gets there, she steals boats on the side of a lake and uses it to get across the lake... she walks to active volcanoes... after all the dangerous things she does at only 7 years old with no parent in sight your biggest concern is that her hair is growing?|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I hope they change her god awful voice also then.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I'm kind of sad about it. Our daughter loves Dora and I don't think she's ever going to need a longer-legged Dora with flowing hair. <br>  <br>  I think kids should grow out of Dora whenever they naturally do. There are plenty of other Nick and Disney shows for older kids and pre-teens.|`|E7IPy6cDaa	i dont find it a problem. it isnt as if dora is starting to smoke ciggs and is pregnant. rugrats grew up and the world didnt end.<br>  <br>  there are still little latino girls that are becoming post preschool that need a positive influence. ( not JUST latino girls but you get my drift)<br>  <br>  i say good for Nickelodeon.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Wouldn't it be funny if they let her age until she is 80.  Dora in a nursing home.   Anyway I don't have a problem with it.  I think they let the rugrats grow up as well.|`|Ppzuclr4aa	I'm actually very disappointed. I think the Dora brand should remain geared towards toddlers and preschoolers. Why don't they just introduce a new character... say Dora's cousin from the big city. How about Diego's older sis, Alicia? Isn't Alicia supposed to be 11 years old? I think they should develop her character more. To change Dora into the next "Bratz" or "Barbie" is truly sad. Kids grow up and move on (I have an 8 year old that loved Dora when she was 3). I think Nickelodeon is missing the mark with this one.|`|KEVdZchtaa	ooooo the older dora wouldnt be the same
K2jT1z5jaa	hey darling.<br>  <br>  tell him exactly how you feel about this. It way to early to be preparing for another & there is no gurantee that it will be another boy<br>  You shouldnt be having sex just yet darling.<br>  Keep strong x<br>  <br>  god bless x Tell him - no stop when you want him to darling - he isnt respecting you|`|x7WphuY5aa	Tell him that unless he wants a child will problems or you to die then he needs to back off you need to let your body rest studies have been done if you have a baby within 17 mo of having a baby then you risk birth defects and  your body need to regain all the nourishment it lost so tell him unless you are going to carry and deliver the baby then back off and when we are both ready we can try|`|o1yy6KABaa	Hes being totally unreasonable and sellfish. You shouldt be having sex this early. He needs to wait until your body is recovered before you can even consider having another baby- it wont be healthy for you OR the baby if you try this soon. Take him to the docs with you when you go for the check up and let the doc tell him this so he can see hes being an inconsiderate ****!|`|D0oqTblpaa	Wow! Maybe he's still riding that new baby high.  But he shouldn't be asking for sex and you shouldn't be giving it.<br>  <br>  Tell him that until your doctor gives you the all clear no more sex.  It could do serious damage to your reproductive system. <br>  <br>  Lay down the law.  Tell him that you want more kids but you have a diaper limit rule.  Say no to two kids in diapers at the same time.  Y'all can have another when this one is potty trained.  It's a good rule of thumb as it helps your body recoup from childbearing.  <br>  <br>  Goodluck and be firm.<br>  <br>  Edit-  I just read your profile.  Your husband is an ER Doctor?  Then he should definitely know better.  Shame on him!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi,Congrats on your baby to start with.I think you need to tell your hubby that your body needs a rest as you have just had a baby and you need time to heal.He should listen and understand you about the waiting time.Good luck and congrats once again.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	If you just had a baby monday you should not be having sex today 5 days later.  You are ging to really mess yourself up.  You must be a heck of alot nicer than I am....|`|QRXtkYrzaa	First off, you just had a baby on Monday. You should NOT be having sex 5 days later. Your body needs time to heal, for one. If it hurts so bad you cry then you should take that as a sign that your body is NOT READY. Plus, your husband sounds like he's off his rocker saying he wants another baby when you already have a brand-new baby that hasn't even begun to be raised. You need to tell him that your body is not ready to be pregnant again, that it needs time to heal and that you could actually be endangering yourself to have a baby so close together.  A lot of people miscarry when they have children before giving their body adequate time to heal. Besides that, you both need some time to bond with your new daughter and build a loving relationship with her before adding yet another to the mix.|`|MMx7TeEBaa	I read your name god bless your angel baby, my daughter was stillborn 11months ago at full term :( so i know how it feels to lose a child.<br>  <br>  But about your hubby wanting another baby so soon. You need to recover physical before having sex also recover from having your baby. <br>  <br>  Explain to him that it is you carrying the baby and that you need this time too recover mentally and physicly and say you arnt ready just yet for another baby also that you need to wait longer before having sex as you can seriously hurt yourself, you will not be fully healed yet. <br>  <br>  he should be more understanding<br>  Hope you both are keeping strong :)|`|mags2ekzaa	your name nearly made me cry, losing a baby must be so hard to deal with<br>  <br>  maybe try to get him to see you have plenty of time in the future to have another baby, but right now maybe you and him should focus on your baby girl for the time being.  also try to get him to see that being pregnant for 9 months and giving birth is very hard work for a woman, and tell him you need to be 100% sure youre ready to do all that again before deciding to have another baby<br>  <br>  tell him you can always have safe sex in the meantime|`|i4bjQbPcaa	You should not be having sex 5 days after giving birth.  And your husband should respect that and wait until you have healed properly.  <br>  <br>  You could end up with a serious infection if you have sex at the moment.  Tell him that and he should respect you.  If he doesn't, leave him.|`|VFifg9FEaa	First you shouldn't be having sex for 6 weeks after the baby is borne. <br>  Second he sounds like he might be a control freak.  Watch out.  Which would explain his unhappiness with a daughter and impatience to correct that error with a son.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	tell him u went to the doctor and he said no sex for six week after the birth for starts, and then just tell him u are not ready to have one right after and u want to wait awhile. if he loves u he should understand
MR9iBgafaa	Ours is a fisher price remote control mobile. It soothes her usually as she gets hynotised by it though the first few times it excited her! Actually my husband and I like it more than her as it's so soothing...|`|723QHuicaa	well our mobile and lullaby lights were only ever put on at sleep times and a huge fuss was not made over them - ie 'wow, look, yaaay!' etc.<br>  <br>  So my daughter knows its time to wind down when they go on.|`|AA12041870	He is thrilled with the movement and is expressing that excitement.  It's a good thing for him because it is teaching him to spend time amusing himself.  You are one lucky Mama if your baby is happy with other things besides you carrying him around.  As he grows, he will be more able to do things on his own if he learns to think and reason at this young age.  Let him look and be happy.  If you keep bothering him, he won't eventually settle down and go to sleep.|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son always got excited too, he liked it moving and it excited him more than anything. I found that just putting a cd player by his crib with some slow music calmed him more. He loved his mobile, but it was more fun than lulling to him.|`|UghJ0XROaa	No, it's intended to entertain them i believe, they wake up in the middle up the night and it gives them something to look at, instead of just staring at the ceiling.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I always thought of it as sorta a hypnosis type thing. they stare at it while the soothing music is playing and eventually it makes their eyes tired.|`|rAkWoweOaa	entertainment purposes|`|deIzFnV8aa	I have never even tried to use it to get DD to sleep, because even the "nighttime" setting is clearly far to interseting to her. A great way to use it though is when you need 10-15 minutes to yourself or to do a chore. The crib is a safe place for them to stay and the mobile will keep them fascinated for at least that long. I live in an apt and I use it every time I need to take the laundry down to the basement to do a load.|`|7clS7baaaa	I think it just depends on the baby and what kind of a mood they are in.   either way whether soothing or exciting the baby it still helps with brain development.  so mobiles are a good thing to have.  good luck with your little miracle!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	They are supposed to sooth, babies will get excited but with my daughter after she had been watching and listening for a while she did eventually fall to sleep.|`|77e94612172ca39d5c0afdb72cbb16d3aa	two reasons. First is to soothe them and send them to sleep. The other reason is to keep them occupied if they are not asleep.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	It's intended to capture their interest and keep them quiet and out of your hair for a bit.|`|mUSzHFeWaa	Yeah, who knows. I think they're pretty creepy, personally.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Never worked for my son either, he loved watching it. In the end I had to take it down lol x|`|KgKVWv9paa	I don't know if they are meant for this or just mind stimulation.  Some babies do get soothed by the noise and music, others get stimulated and gets them going.  He might also just really dig the characters floating around.  Turn it on and stay in the room with him to give your extra mommy soothing until he falls asleep. He should soon learn/associate the mobile with calm and sleep time.  At least it makes him smile and doesn't scare him.  Just be patient.  You'll get some rest too...eventually.|`|Ev1r2GHuaa	I do not think that it is intended to put the baby to sleep. I think that it is mostly used to captivate the babies attention as if the baby had ours. Maybe take the off him/her being in the crib alone.|`|AA10274499	it really depends on the kid.  my son did the same thing.  some kids get excited and it calms some kids down.  I think it's mostly for visual stimulation, good for the little baby brain.|`|HaKAwuG3aa	Kids love to play with their parents toys, they know it something unusual and they are not allowed to play with it, so makes them so excited when you give them something that they fel it's not theirs :)|`|t4DP30r6aa	sometimes I think.. But also just to give them some visual stimulation, exercise their eyes and brain.
MSGixNibaa	I love Aiden, but I would never, ever use it. It’s is WAY too popular. Remember all the Ashley’s and Brandon’s of the 80’s and 90’s? Well, 10 years from now we’ll be saying the same thing about Aiden and Madison. It also started the “add an –aden” craze when we got all those Braydon’s, Bladon’s, Draydon’s, and Caden’s. A friend and I joke all the time about the name Aiden. It’s the ultimate little boy name. Anytime we here of a little boy being born, we always just assume they named him Aiden and 3/5 times we’ve been correct!<br>  <br>  Anthony is lovely, but I don’t personally like the sound. It’s also incredibly popular. Did you know that Anthony has been on the top 100 for boy names since the 1880’s?  It was number 94 in 1880 and number 7 in 2007. <br>  <br>  Asher now, I adore. I’ve loved this for a long time. We’ve had an off an on affair, though. Lol. Asher Noah was once my favorite name for a boy, in my number one spot! I love how it sounds, what it means, how it looks. I love everything about it. Obvious choice.<br>  <br>  #1 Asher<br>  #2 Anthony<br>  #3 Aiden|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i like asher, there are probably 10-15 boys at my daughters' daycare all named aidan, i personally don't like aidan.  anthony is nice but not original and more old school.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Anthony the best. He can choose to be Tony or Anthony, whichever he likes. Aidan is too common, and I don't like Asher.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Anthony|`|sGP6s7uraa	Asher|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Aidan|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Anthony    that is my sons middle name I love the name anthony|`|wdXQaATDaa	Aiden!!!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I feel that Anthony is more of a name that a boy can grow up with. It's not overly popular like Aidan seems to be, and Asher would probably get some funny looks from people- it IS a but different.<br>  <br>  He could always go by Tony, and I know Andy is usually a NN for Andrew, but I don't see why it couldn't be a NN for Anthony as well.|`|2LB3bWdpaa	I like Anthony the best (although I really don't like that ppl shorten it to Tony. i think Anthony is a much nicer name than Tony.) Aidan is too popular right now, although it is a nice name. Asher is a decent name that you don't hear as often but I think it sounds a little "soft" for a boy. I think it's definitely usable though (i have suggested it as a mn before).|`|8CTNzb6kaa	From  Fav to least fav<br>  <br>  Asher <br>  Aidan<br>  Anthony|`|5587e6858af0815b60a2d4300d0ae64aaa	Ayden Alexander or Anthony Joseph. Not Asher. It makes me think of cigarette ashes.|`|MY12veP5aa	Aidan<br>  <br>  or maybe Anthony. But definitely NOT Asher.|`|1770c7574e98befdabd3d54687581695aa	Asher, its different|`|G5Wsaa63aa	Aidan.|`|bw00QLP7aa	Aidan is still a favorite of mine, but I prefer it spelled Ayden. <br>  Asher would be my next choice.|`|1cRANJXNaa	Aidan|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Asher|`|dR2bqUixaa	Aidan|`|qWXb4DIGaa	Aidan|`|x47cIHFMaa	AIDAN!|`|Im4K2eFIaa	Aidan.

My fave boys name :)|`|KVSczlpXaa	Definatley Anthony Christopher.|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I love the name Aidan Quinn!<br>  <br>  also like<br>  Asher Quinn|`|Ya1zZORIaa	I like Aidan but it is becoming so popular, the kid would have like 6 of them in his 1st grade class. I like Anden, that is a different name but kind of similar to the list you have going. I like Ashton instead of Asher.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	My first choice would be Asher.  I like the sound of it and it isn't very common! <br>  <br>  Anthony would be my second choice.  I just like the ring of Asher better I guess!<br>  <br>  Aidan would be my last choice.  Although I do like the name it has just become way too popular for my liking.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	1. Aidan<br>  2. Asher<br>  3. Anthony|`|lYjweuZmaa	Aiden Eli<br>  <br>  that's a beautiful name for a boy. i prefer Aiden rather than Aidan though|`|SfwLF8j2aa	I like Aidan,so cute! Asher is good too!! Good Luck:)
pNwOmAPoaa	I feel exactly the way you feel right now.  I'm 37wks+4d now and also have trouble sleeping since last week.  Try to sleep on a softer mattress where your body contour can be accommodated.  I sleep on my sides also as per my doctor's advice but I put pillows under and have another pillow between my legs.  In this case if i turn to my side my big tummy will not really fall down because of the pillow.  It gets me comfortable i can sleep a bit.  Though if I get tired and needs to turn to the other side, i really have to make an effort to turn because of my heavy tummy so it gets me awake again for a while.  I make certain that i have pillows on both sides to get me comfortable when i shift positions.  Hope this advice will help.|`|6pxLm72zaa	i feel the same way my sleeping patterns have changed the doctor told me to sleep on my left side but that even hurts i would ask ur doctor to see what they have to  say|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You're due just a few days before me. I feel the same way too. Every week it seems like my limbs go more and more numb. My doctor told me to take half a unisom at night so I can sleep better. Also, keep moving around and trying new sleep positions that work for you. Everyone's different.|`|X3zl9hZCaa	I had the same problem and it started at 4 months and I would wake up in tears from leg cramps and back pain in the middle of the night and my husband tried everything to ease my pain and he finally decided to go to Walmart and buy me a body pillow for $10 and since then I have had absolutely no complaints about sleep (other than Charlie horses!) So I recommend the body pillow and no there is nothing wrong with you...it's very normal!|`|AA11208683	well its probably how the baby is laying in this pregnancy hes probably sitting on you nerves... i would try taking some tylenol pm, thats what my doctor told me because i was having trouble sleeping.... i get cramps in my sides when im sleeping and i end up waking up and turning over. it might help to stretch a little before going to bed as well, usually when i am walking around a lot during the day i sleep a ton better at night... i hope this helps good luck!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	try to up your calcium and potassium intake. Also stay hydrated.. And maybe try to sleep with a pillow in between your legs. It is likely the baby laying or pressing on a nerve. And if the pain gets too bad, take some tylenol and let your doctor know what's going on.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I am a back sleeper, so sleeping on the side is very hard for me too.  My doctor told me to keep the pillow under one of your side so you are sleeping little tilted.  That way I am not completely sleeping on my back and the blood will flow normally to my baby.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Talk to your Dr about this. <br>  Just keep experimenting to see what position you can get comfy in.  I have to have about 5 pillows all around me, plus my body pillow.
y6g0RnuAaa	This would never have worked with my son. We tried a sleep positioner to help him sleep when he was 2 weeks old and he wiggled out of it within 5 minutes. I wouldn't buy it- a lot of baby products are gimmicks and don't work.|`|5udXQ79Laa	Seems too pricey for me|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	It is recommend that you do not put anything in their crib or else you risk SIDS.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The current recommendations are not to put "certain" things in the crib but to not put ANYTHING in the crib.  How is that a dumb comment?  Maybe do some research...<br>  <br>  take note of #7: <a href="http://www.firstcandle.org/new_exp_parents/pdf/Important%20Tips%20&%20Guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstcandle.org/new_exp_paren...</a>
kprKXEOSaa	You don't have to get them to respect or accept your choice.  It is your choice, it is your life.  If you don't want to be a dad, you shouldn't.  I hope you will have a vasectomy if you are serious, and make sure any women you date know you don't want kids, biological or adopted, right off, so you're not dating them under false pretenses.<br>  Many doctors won't do a vasectomy on a young guy, because they figure you might change your mind.  If you can't find a doctor to perform the procedure for you, I hope you're using a condom and spermicide each and every time, if you're having sex with women.<br>  Bottom line, it's your life, and your parents may never come to terms with it.  But you'd better be taking control of your sperm, or you  may end up a father nonetheless.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Take it as a complement.

Then your parents may listen.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Try telling them that "right now in your life" you don't see having children.  Your mother is probably correct; none of us have any crystal balls.  But most of us who have gotten past your point in life realize that attitudes, even important attitudes, can change as Life brings changes in your life.  You can ask your parents to respect you current situation without trying to force an unpleasant expectation down their throats.  Just be nice and focus on where you are, right now, in your life.  You should be able to state, in all truthfulness, that you don't know how things might be for you, down-the-road.  It gives them a ray of hope without you having to give up whatever your current belief is.  I know (no matter what your age is) but you would do yourself a favor by realizing that you don't know evrything important there is to know.  Hopefully, you can approach all life as a learning experience.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Do you have siblings? My brother doesn't want to have kids, and he's not going to... He married a woman who feels the same. Sure, my parents would have liked him to, but I think it's easier on them because they have three other children who all have kids! <br>  <br>  If you don't have a brother or sister, who is going to have kids, I'm afraid they will likely keep hounding you... Just smile, nod, and ignore. :)|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Welllllll........my brother is the same way as you are.  He flies helicopters in the Marines and even divorced his long time girlfriend because of the kid thing.<br>  <br>  Just tell them that you are serious about this.  Kids aren't for everyone.  At least you recognize that about yourself.  Tell them that they should be happy you don't want to disappoint a child by bringing them into the world with a dad who doesn't care too much about them.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you're the only male child so I can also feel your parents pain, just be patient with them and stay strong!|`|LwbwMFX9aa	you cant make anyone do anything, get over it and dont stew over it<br>  <br>  if you're between 18 and 25 and male youre to young to say that, but as you age you will feel that tug eventually but do what you want its your life|`|9ff653285dcca235b469d9b2b3442377aa	I have a very good friend who was in the same mind set as you, when we were "involved" and 23 years old he made it VERY blatant to me that he didn't want children and no one will change his mind.  I respected his decision.<br>  <br>  Many years later he gets involved with a woman and they have a daughter unexpectedly, who he simply ADORES.  <br>  <br>  My point it this, kudos for standing up to your parents if you don't want children, that that is simply your choice.  It doesn't make you a bad person or a child hater for not wanting kids of your own.  Just stand your ground, it's not their choice to make.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how old you are, but you never know...things change, life happens.  Keep an open mind... you never know, it may change or it may not.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I hate to say it, but if they don't respect it now they may never respect it.  But it's your choice to make.  Make it and don't let others influence you unless you want to change your mind.<br>  <br>  Be sure this is what you really want though.  Many women out there really want children.  I hope that the woman you meet and marry understands and shares the same mind set.  That kind of thing can cause a huge rift in the marriage.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Your parents don't have to respect your choice. It's your choice, be satisfied with it, don't let them bother you when they disagree. In fact, you really don't have to even talk about it with them. If they ask you to have kids, you can just shrug and say "maybe one day" and never give them a real answer.

An older parent (or set of parents) has simply seen way more of life than they'd seen when they were younger.  They are more capable of anticipating child-rearing problems and heading them off before there's serious trouble.  Older parents are more likely to be calm than younger ones, and that benefits their child immensely.  Older parents have more settled personal values, and so they have a better chance of rearing their children to have integrity.  Children who are complimented as being "very mature for their age" often were born to older parents.  (Often, not always.)<br>  <br>  That's not to say that there are no disadvantages to the child/children born of older parents.  The ordinary debilities that grow on us with time can often be enough to slow down the older parent, even to the point of leaving their child deprived of necessary attentions -- if the parent's eyesight is failing too fast, can they give as much help to the child with homework as when the parent was younger?  Is the parent fast enough anymore to have a good game of ball with the kid, or go on a hike at a pace the child will learn most from (can the parent jump the stream like the kid does, etc)?  And of course, there is always the disadvantage that carrying you could have killed your mother;  or that by conceiving you at such a late age, you had a greater chance of being born disabled in some way (including intellectual disability -- quite the opposite of what you were suggesting).<br>  <br>  So, don't thank your parents for your intelligence merely because your mother was older at your birth.  But do thank her/them for whatever patience, good values, and rich childhood experiences they may have given you, because so many of these will have come from their greater wisdom.<br>  <br>  My mother was 19 when she had me, and my sister and two brothers were all born before she was 24.  We're all reasonably intelligent (not geniuses or anything, but we can hold a conversation occasionally   :-D  ).  But all of us have had serious issues of maturity to work out before any of us were blessed with successful marriages.  And all of us waited until we were at least 25 before starting families of our own, and most waited years longer.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	21|`|ZARozVAHaa	17|`|0e1c82c3e51c8fc7239168c6e717e201aa	My mother was 23 years old, when i was born.

17c9652c588d0895008ca5507d3558f9aa	You should have probably started potty training by 2 but it doesn't mean they will be interested. You have to try and see how the kid takes it. My son will be two in about 3 weeks. He might use the potty when he gets up. But he usually ends up going before we make it to the potty. A few times he has done it during the day. Usually he just sits there for a half a second and want to go. He gets mad if you try to put him back on. <br>  <br>  Most people don't have their kids potty trained before 2. But you should have tried at least some and if you kid is totally against it wait a little longer. You don't want to push so hard it is a bad experience. <br>  <br>  I do believe a lot of it is how willing the parents are to teach. I have seen it before. My one friend wasn't potty trained until she was over 5 and it was her mom's fault. She never took the time. But on the other hand a parent can try to teach all they want and the child is unwilling to learn. So in some cases kids learn really late and it not be the parents fault. <br>  <br>  If the parents seem like they are involved in the little boys life. And are teaching him other life skills then they probably know what's best for their kid. If they seem like they don't care what their son does then they probably on the lazy side. <br>  <br>  But not being potty trained or not started by 2 is not bad. I have just started pushing a little harder with my son.|`|CEAOj6MDaa	Since you don't have children, I don't think it's your place to say what is bad or good for a child.  Become a parent first and then ask questions.<br>  <br>  One thing you will learn, and that is that every child is different.  It has nothing to do with a lazy parent or a child that can't learn.<br>  <br>  When that baby is ready, he will be potty trained regardless if the parents are lazy or not!  Children are wonderful, little people that can't be labeled or molded (no two are the same.  And just because you or your siblings were one way has nothing to do with this child).|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Boys take a lot longer than girls in the potty training department.  My son (5 now) wasn't potty trained until he was almost 3 and my daughter is 17 months and is almost potty trained.  She is in big girl underpants when we are at home but when we're out and about I do still put her in a diaper:)<br>  <br>  You definitely never want to push the potty training issue with your kids, especially if they aren't ready, it will only make it harder and longer.  I do think they should have a potty chair to get him use to the idea.... Maybe you could get him one for his birthday!|`|dRjB0isAaa	I actually tried IPT (infant potty training) and started w. my daughter when she was 4 months old.

However, most parents are potty training their kids at about 2. That doesn't necessarily mean that they should be potty trained by that age. It all depends.. because every child is different.  I suggest buying a good book or doing some research to know what signs to look for when a child is ready.  Parents are usually encouraged to INTRODUCE potty training to children by the age of two.. they shouldn't be forcing it on them, but just showing them what it's like. The longer they wait to introduce it to the kids, the longer the process will be. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to wait until the child is physically and mentally ready.|`|DdLfaEzNaa	My mom, who raised 5 boys and 1 girl, told me to wait until my boy was 3 before even trying.  He was potty trained within a week from when we started, which was about 3 weeks after he turned three.  My second one showed interest just after he was 2, so we tried and tried, but he didn't really get it until he was about 3-1/2.  If we had just waited, we would have spared ourselves (and him) a lot of stress and misery.  My 3rd is 2-1/2 right now, and while he occasionally asks to use the toilet and we reward him when he does, we aren't officially training  him yet.  He's not interested enough and I just don't think he's ready.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	thats not weird because some parents dont potty train until 3 or 4 years old. they dont mind changing diapers and wasting money on them either.<br>  i potty trained my kids b4 the age of two and it only took two months because their father did it all while I was at work.|`|rYNM67oyaa	Boys are slower.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	OH my gosh!  That poor little boy is under so much pressure and he doesn't even know it!  Don't listen to ANYONE tell you when to start except the little boy himself!<br>  <br>  Girls always are ready before boys--it's a developmental thing, and that is all there is too it.  Both boys and girls are ready to begin training when they can stay dry for long periods of time, can identify that they are actually peeing and pooping and telling you...<br>  <br>  If you see them standing or squatting  and can tell that they are getting ready to "do their business" invite them to go to the potty.  First, you need to get the potty, have it around, have them be comfortable with it, and also let them see you using the toilet.<br>  <br>  It has to be a comfortable thing for them--something they are used to.<br>  <br>  There are tons of books for both parents and kids--please read up on the subject, and do not listen to those who will tell you that that boy should be trained at 2--it is not weird, it is normal.  And for both boys & girls, they will master the peeing part way earlier than the pooping part...it could as late as 4 before they will never have accidents with poop.<br>  <br>  Some kids even have accidents once they get in kindergarten--but it is important to treat it as an accident and not a moral short-coming of the kid.  Some parents act like the kid did it on purpose and punish the kid, who is already traumatized enough that he did such a yucky think in the first place!

0CA5eNOCaa	My baby would get full from one breast when he was an infant. Feed your baby as much as he (or she) wants to eat. If he's full after emptying one breast, then pump the other one to avoid engorgement & mastitis (infection). As my baby (now 5 months) got older, he ate more. Sometimes he'll feed from both breasts & sometimes just one. Your body will adjust to your baby's needs, meaning you won't over-produce milk for too much longer. Try cool cabbage leaves inside your nursing bra over your breasts. <br>  <br>  YES, CABBAGE LEAVES REALLY DO WORK (4 ALL U SKEPTICAL READERS)<br>  <br>  The leaves work wonders relieving fever, heat, & tenderness from the breasts.<br>  <br>  Long story short, if your baby only wants to feed from 1 breast per feeding, pump or express the excess milk from the other breast. THAT'S WHAT I DID. It'll get better soon, I promise.|`|aaDQFkhKaa	I have always been told to breast feed on one side for 15 mins then burp and finish up the feeding with the other. Personally I fed my babies on whatever side felt full.  Half the time I couldn't remember which breast I fed then on last so I would go with the one that felt fullest. Do what is best for YOU!!! Parenting is going along with your instincts and knowing all your options.<br>  <br>  Good for you for breast feeding your baby.|`|dcba5c013f6e87cbb48a9c3f3520cd7caa	do what is going to be comfortable for i would switch to the other side during the feeding when they get to full it does not feel good or you could feed from one side and express the other side|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I always stopped halfway through and switched to the other breast and then at the next feeding I would start with the breast I had last ended with and that would help empty it out.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	What was the reason you were told to do this? Is it to reduce supply or treat acid reflux? I did it for these reasons. The goal is to do smaller feedings more often and reduce your supply therefore giving your baby more hindmilk and less foremilk. It did work. You can express a little milk from the second breast to make yourself more comfortable if this is the goal. Don't take too much out since the eventual goal is to reduce supply, just enough to be comfortable.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I have done both. Now that she is a bit older and my breasts are used to it I can feed her from one at a time. In the beginning though I remember I had to switch during a feeding because they would get so full. I would say just do whatever is most comfortable for you and baby.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Everyone has a different opinion on this, so there is no firm answer.  What you do want to do is try and get baby to empty one breast, so they get the creamy rich hindmilk at the end. This usually occurs after 10-15 minutes of nursing, but you can also feel your breast get saggy and the swallowing slow down.  Many babies aren't ready to be done yet and will nurse some from the other side as well.  What I do with DD is try and get her to eat about 20 minutes total - 5 minutes on one side and 15 on the other, about.  I alternate which side I start on.  Even letting your baby nurse for a few minutes on the second side should reduce the fullness to a comfortable level. YOu can also pump a bit on the second side to releive the pressure.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	No I offer one side for about 10 minutes and then I switch her to the other side. The next time I nurse her I would start with the side I finished nursing her with. You should continue to pump a little after nursing. It will build your supply and you can use in the future when you need to go out, go to work, or if you get sick (husband can help with the feeding)<br>  <br>  ETA If my baby gets full from nursing on one side and refuse to nurse on the other side, I would pump.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	I've heard this too, but don't do it anymore.  I feed him one until he takes himself off.  Then I burp him and offer him the other. If he doesn't take it, I sometimes pump to get a stash.  You are also still in the beginning stages of feeding, so your body is regulating your breast.  You will still have engorgement.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	You are meant to feed only from one breast while they are still so young. The reason is that the higher fat hindmilk is the milk that comes out last from the breast. That's why your baby should empty one breat to make sure they are getting the good milk as the first bit of milk is more watery and sweeter.<br>  <br>  When your baby is about 4 weeks old he/she should start taking both breasts. This could happen sooner. It depends on how hungry your baby is. If your baby seems satisfied after one breast and is putting on good weight then that is probably enough.<br>  <br>  If you other breast is really full then you must be making a lot of milk which is great. You could try to have your baby sucking on one breast for few minutes to relieve some of the fullness and pain and then put it onto the other breast and let it empty that one. You could also use a pump for the full breast and store the milk in the freezer for times when you might need it (if you need to be away for few hours or become sick). <br>  <br>  Remember that the baby gets more milk from your breast than a pump ever will so it might be enough for him/her to suck on only one breast while he/she is so young. <br>  <br>  If not sure then ask your healthcare nurse. They should be happy to answer any questions you have.

With my son I wore my regular jeans COMFORTABLY until I was around 22-26 weeks when I had a tiny bump and they didnt fit anymore. Then I actually looked normal pregnant around 35 weeks haha good luck! were both 6 weeks pregnant!!!|`|Um3qrVrqaa	Firstly, yes its normal. <br>  <br>  Secondly, don't ever let anyone tell you what the "normal amount" of weight to gain, especially if you are eating right and excercising. Some people will gain 70lbs during their pregnancy and honestly, you can't even tell where it all went. Some people only gain 15lbs. Every person and every pregnancy is different. The average weight gain is 25-35 lbs but that doesn't mean anything.|`|a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	Hello..<br>  <br>  Every woman and every pregnancy is different, you could just be bloated at the moment, or you could be just carrying alot of fluid right now.

Your uterus is still well below your pelvic bone so it's not the baby yet. Bloat is very common in early pregnancy.
Bc4ZDVk4aa	for starters i think this is rubbish a grown woman should know how to spell "failure" and you don't need to put "teen" after 15 after all there is a spell checker on here..and if there was a chance my 15 yr old daughter was pregnant i would bring her straight to the doc to confirm it one way or the other.|`|sk46uigvaa	I fell pregnant when i was 15, and i can tell you now it had NOTHING to do with my mother's parenting skills!.<br>  <br>  You ARE NOT a bad mother!!<br>  <br>  I fell pregnant because i was too stupid and irresponsible when it came to contraception, we moved house and i forgot to take my birth Control pills for a few days.<br>  <br>  I never went onto have the baby in the end but my boyfriend and i stayed together and now we are 21 and married and we have a beautiful daughter, we both have careers and are more successful then most other people we know of our age.<br>  <br>  The test was negative because she's not pregnant, so panic over!<br>  carry on supporting your daughter like you have already and she'll grow into a fine young women.<br>  <br>  God luck|`|hzlqCBWnaa	yes they r accurate. your not a failure. i have the best mother in the world and i still ended up pregnant at 15 but miscarried that pregnancy. girls half to learn for there self nothing your did or didnt do. goodluck.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	It was clear?

Most 15year olds including myself wouldn't dare tell their parents. It shows that she is able to confide in you, something which most don't do. <br>  Just support her, thats all she needs..|`|Qk8VQukpaa	they are pretty accurate but if you don't agree take her to the doctor for a blood test.<br>  Also you are not a failure...you cant control everything your child does...all you can do is show her the way and have faith that she is doing the right thing...the only way u would be considered a failure is when you chose not to love her because of her mistakes...<br>  i hope this helps!|`|ESWqGNtiaa	your not a failure, that's the very worst thing you could think right now.<br>  <br>  you may be a little mad, but you don't want a baby (if she's pregnant) being brought up into an unloving world. whatever happens to you daughter you need to make sure you are supportive in the choices she makes. offer advice, but don't be controlling and . you HAVE NOT failed her, i can assure you. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|EZdHWa4taa	Maybe you should see a doctor. <br>  <br>  Things happen that some of us can't prevent. You also have to remember that you brought your daughter in this world to make mistakes and learn from them, not to be perfect.

wiAVa1H5aa	It's his new normal, it's normal for breast fed babies to poop each time they nurse OR to save it for up to 10 days!   My oldest did the former, my youngest the later - and waiting for poop is infuriating as heck but normal.   Essentially he's absorbed almost all the milk you produce so he doesn't have the back pressure to need to poop, as long as he's peeing plenty and seems fine then he's fine.<br>  <br>  And please for Heaven's sake don't introduce formula, that would be the wrong thing right now.|`|C1SFDyOhaa	a baby should not go beyond3 days with no bowel movement,hence a bowel obstruction could occur contact your md IMMEDIATELYbetter yet take the baby to the er room explain to dr the problem and please do not attempt a enema without md instructions|`|Z0KQenm9aa	if you take him off the breast the only good substitute is goats milk... the other formulas will fatten and constipate the baby... they are trash all the crap in them... at 3 months old id give him some fruit too also a warm bath may relax him and stimulate a bm|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/pediatricks/poop.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/p...</a><br>  Hard, pellet - like, presence of blood or mucous<br>  This is constipation in a breastfed baby and is so very rare that I cannot recall ever seeing it in a baby who is receiving breastmilk as a sole source of nutrition, as are most babies in the first six months.  It could be related to a food allergy.  Formula fed babies get constipated much more often and may even have harder bigger stools like older kids and adults.  Getting these stools softer is a balancing act of great proportions.  <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There is something important to point out regarding frequency of stooling in an exclusively breastfed baby.  Many parents are concerned when after the early weeks where they may have been seeing a little bowel movement in almost every diaper, they suddenly begin to see days go by without any.  This is perfectly normal.  There is a great range of frequency of bowel movements with exclusively breastfed infants, ranging from a couple of times a day to several days.  There are completely healthy nursing babies that have a bowel movement once a week, once every ten days, or even a few that go a bit longer. If your baby is healthy, developing well, nursing well and the consistency of the bowel movement when it does make its appearance is soft or loose, then do not be concerned.  It is not constipation if it arrives in soft form.  Constipation would arrive in pellets and hard formed pieces.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#NormalStools" rel="nofollow">http://www.mother-2-mother.com/normal.ht...</a><br>  At around the age of six weeks, the stooling pattern of a breastfed baby may change. It is not uncommon for the breastfed baby to skip days between bowel movements. Some babies skip every other day, some go every two or three days, some once every 5 - 7 days, and some babies hold out for up to 11 or 12 days at a time - then have quite a FULL diaper when they DO go!<br>  <br>  There is absolutely no reason to intervene and try methods commonly used to "induce" a bowel movement (such as prune or other types of juices, water, glycerin suppositories, or using rectal stimulation). If artificial stimulation is done too often, the baby's system can become dependant upon this stimulation to "go", and no longer is able to have a normal bowel movement on their own.<br>  <br>  In most cases, as long as baby is not acting ill (lethargic, crying in pain, etc.), the tummy is soft, not rigid or distended, skipping days between stools is not cause for alarm, however, mother should not hesitate to ask her health care provider to check her baby to be sure there is no physical problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/tips-and-solutions/41/constipation-in-the-breastfed-baby" rel="nofollow">http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/tip...</a><br>  After 6 weeks of age, some healthy breastfed babies have bowel movements far less often. If the baby seems happy, is gaining weight well, and the stools are soft when they are passed, then it is not a problem. Usually the stool will be very large if it has been a few days (or even more) since baby last made a dirty diaper.<br>  <br>  Constipation occurs when the stool is hard and dry when it is passed, not when baby has infrequent stools. A constipated baby might be ill, especially if he is also vomiting frequently, does not want to breastfeed, seems weak and has a dry mouth.  If your baby has these symptoms, get immediate medical care.<br>  <br>  Babies and toddlers can get constipated from cow’s milk based formulas, cow’s milk and rice cereal.  Exclusively breastfed babies rarely get constipated, but once other foods are added the stools get firmer. The baby’s doctor, a registered dietician, or an IBCLC can help you figure out which foods might be causing a problem. Check with the baby’s doctor if you are concerned about your baby’s pattern of bowel movements.|`|AA10088149	My daughter did this a couple of times ...suddenly stopped pooing..once for over a week..she wasn't constipated - when it arrived it wasn't hard just there was rather a lot of it (!)<br>  I was told that it can happen in bfd babies - one baby apparently didn't  poo for as long as 16 days.<br>  Baby Massaging their tummy in clockwise circles and sort of pushing down towards their bottom really helps to get things moving - probably best to get your health visitor/similar to demonstrate. A friend's (peasant) Moroccan mother recommended putting a small piece of rolled up paper in their daughter's anus for a similar 'problem' -apparently worked spectacularly well - but I didn't try it and don't know if I would recommend it!<br>  But if you are worried and especially if your baby's tummy feels hard or distended or sore get them seen by a doctor.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	Do NOT buy formula - it will definatly make the problem worse! <br>  Give him a teaspoon of apple juice. If he still hasn't pooped by the end of the day I would take him to the dr. - if his tummy is hard and he's cranky they may help him, but it's not uncommon for small children to go a week without pooping. <br>  DO NOT SWITCH TO FORMULA FOR THIS!!!|`|FBjG6zblaa	give him warm water with 1tsp of honey , mix it well & give him to drink.Give this twice a day,for sure it is going to work because my baby had also.<br>  If not then give him 1tsp of gripe water mix with 1tsp of water & give him to drink it will also help.|`|ee1o46cTaa	try just giving him a small drink of boiled(cooled)water before his breastfeed.sometimes a little prune juice diluted in the water may help.also move his legs in a bike riding motion and gently massage the tummy and upper thighs.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	U can put 1oz of bmilk in a bottle and add 1 teaspoon of dark karo syrup.

But it worked.|`|KICQQxLxaa	He may not be constipated.  Sometimes bf babies change their bowel habits, and may not pass stool for a few days or more.<br>  <br>  NO, don't give him formula...that will make matters worse!  Not sure why you think that this will help...<br>  <br>  Give it a few more days of nursing, and if he still doesn't have a movement, contact his doctor.  More than likely, he is just fine.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I think I asked this exact same question awhile ago...don't worry, if he is EBF he isn't constipated.  I am sure he'll be filling his diaper any time now.

The only way to be 100% sure you aren't pregnant is to see a doctor. There may be a free clinic near where you live. <br>  <br>  If you aren't pregnant, you may be missing your period because of lack of sleep, food, or stress. Any change in your diet or daily life can cause your cycle to change. <br>  <br>  See a doctor and try to relax.

S5n5Za78aa	There's no specific time to check it, but try to be consistent. So, do it every morning when you wake up if you'd like to get everything charted at once. Otherwise, pick a time during the day that works best for you. Cervical position/mucus can change a bit throughout the day, plus it can be a little tricky decipher exactly what's going on, so it's not an exact science anyway. It's simply another aspect of your cycle that can help make an ambiguous chart a little more clear.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would check it at different times throughout the day because you have different positions all day.  You always record the most fertile position.  Usually after you do a number two (sorry for the tmi) is a good time because you can see how the mucus is...it will be a lot more abundant then.

vIO2jWu9aa	I feel sorry for the 14 children of this irresponsible woman. I am angry because WE, the taxpayers, have to support the fact that she was irresponsible and selfish.  For her to claim that she's not getting taxpayer money is a lie. She admitted she gets food stamps. So what if it's "temporary" she still is getting public money.<br>  <br>  There is no way she didn't plan on have a bunch of kids. She even told her mother, in the taped argument, that you either use the eggs or destroy them. She wasn't going to destroy her eggs. She knew damn well what she was doing!<br>  <br>  There is no way she can properly raise 14 children without MAJOR help!|`|VHHis05Naa	Yeah, but those other women likely wouldn't be a single welfare mom with SIX other kids she does not pay for or even seem to take care of.  <br>  <br>  I would choose to reduce the number of embryos to give the surviving babies a good chance at life.  Most high number multiples do not survive.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, she was implanted with 6 embryos - with 6 kids at home, this puts the blame squarely on her fertility doctor for not doing the medically ethical thing and denying her treatment.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	It is a very hard choice to have to decide to selectively reduce a multiple pregnancy...IF she had been a married woman with a nice house and a good support system in place, the number of babies would not be an issue. The fact is that she was a single mom with 6 kids before she got pregnant with these 8 babies. She requested to implant more than the reccomended number of embryos. She had to have known that there was a chance that she would end up with at least 6 kids if she implanted 6 embryos! She has not considered that even IF she finshes school and gets a degree in counceling that she cannot support 14 kids. 2 of her older kids have special needs, and several of the octuplets could end up with special needs ( due to prematurity issues). How the heck is she going to give attention to all the kids, work, and deal with thier special needs?|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	3 that accidentally end up 7 is way different than 6 that end up 8. No, I wouldn't abort, but I wouldn't be in that situation because I know if I'm struggling with 6 kids I'm not wasting money on IVF just so I can struggle with more. Most people with common sense would spend that money on a home for her kids, not plastic surgery to look like Angelina Jolie and another batch of kids she can't afford.|`|sEihaeLNaa	its not the fact that she had 8 kids its the fact that she did this even after knowing she was not going to be able to care for the kids, with no job, no money and no house. why would you want to bring some kids into the world that way.|`|AA11756768	Having 3 embroyo's implanted would be normal, but she had 6. She is also single, not working, and had 6 kids to take care of already. She may not have meant to had 8, but with 6 kids already and being single with no job I think most of us could agree that it wasn't really the time for her to be having more children, who do you think is paying for all those kids?? There are also risks involved in having that many children at 1 time, so she was putting all those babies at risk by having that many at once. <br>  <br>  And no, I don't think she should have aborted them, she shouldn't have had all those eggs implanted in the first place.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	They are mad at her because she had a crazy amount implanted, she is a single mother living off of the system, with a bunch of kids at home that she already can't afford to support.  Her home is about to go into foreclosure and the list goes on. <br>  I personally think anyone who purposely  brings a child into this world when they can't take care of it is disgusting.|`|w17xLr8waa	she had 6 implanted. I would not abort of course not. But also I wouldn't think of having anymore kids if I already had 6 that I couldn't take care of. She doesn't have a job she lives of welfare and food stamps. That's fine and all, but she should atleast try to find a job, and take care of those kids the right way. Not in a 3 bedroom house for 15 people now. 14 kids are too many esp. if you can't afford them!|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i think it's more of the fact that she doesn't seem all there.  she already has 6 kids & she has no job & no real support system to help her with 8 brand new babies.<br>  i don't think i would abort but couldn't imagine having more than two babies during a pregnancy.  most drs i know will not implant more than two for safety of the child(ren) & mother.  <br>  i was like people need to leave her alone until i saw she had so many other children & the fact that she seemed, i don't really want to say crazy, just not in her right mind.|`|7clS7baaaa	no abortion is never an option in my book.....btw she could not have paid the dr. since shes flat broke to begin with.  either way she made a mistake and she should have to suffer the consequences just like anybody else should.  the children should be placed somewhere other than with her or adopted out....she needs to get her life together before she can take care of anymore children, better yet before she can take care of the 6 children shes already got.  shes living off the state, which is ok to do if you have absolutely no means, you need help, and you HAVE tried to get a job. she doesnt even want to look for a job to help support them.  she has no vehicle or roof for them to sleep under and be warm every night.  her poor mother is losing HER only home because shes been helping Nadia...this whole situation is a complete disaster and ALL could have been avoided by either taking care of everybody in the picture now by getting a job, etc and there life built up...then having more children later, OR not EVER having anymore children. ....my heart goes out to all 14 children....|`|AA11616741	I'm just mad that she had the money to spend on IVF, but she doesn't have the money to support the children. Each procedure of IVF is at least 10K  and all of her kids were conceived by IVF.|`|sAbah6dTaa	no i wouldn't abort, but i wouldn't have put that many in at once, i heard she had all EIGHT implanted... she wanted that many.|`|tht0DrHsaa	I would not do infertility treatments if I was living with my mother and already had 6 kids and NO job.|`|YR9h8p77aa	First of all, she went on the Dr Phil show and admitted what she did was wrong.  She knew that there were going to be 6 embryos implanted and what the risks were.  When she says she knows the risks and was willing to take them, knowing that she was putting the lives of her children in danger, I have to think that she wasn't doing this for the kids but for herself.  It's not just her having 8 babies at one time, it's all the other things that are coming out at the same time that are making the public mad.  Now, everyone will have to pay for those children.  Our tax dollars will raise them and keep her hair and nails done.  The whole thing is a big mess and while I ultimately think it's the doctors fault for implanting them in the first place...I just feel sorry for those kids and what they will have to go through.   <br>  <br>  <br>  As for what I would do, It's very hard to say what you will do until it actually happens.  Then again, my hubby and I both have jobs and served in the military to pay for school so we can afford our life and our son.  Everyone's situation is different.
bCdik11yaa	yes, i have this same problem. it started when my daughter was about 3&1/2. she battles this still at 5 years old. she would wake up crying like crazy that her foot hurt. my doc told me it's more than likely growing pains also. the only thing that i do is if she complains, i grab some lotion and rub her little foot. other times i just rub it and put a little band-aid on it (it seems to make her feel better in her mind). gradually as time goes by, the waking gets less and less. only other suggestion is a nice warm bath before bed and some lavender scented lotion afterwards.|`|vrHeGvy2aa	I totally agree with Mz.Rahi.  It could definitely be just growing pains but I have a friend who's daughter was diagnosed with "growing pains."  Months later, they found out she had Lyme disease from a tick bite she had gotten in the summer.  It was something she should have been treated for alot sooner than she was.|`|2b687adad109caf75a0d3985564fef32aa	My daughter growing was having really bad growing pains. I would give her tylenol and wrap her legs with a warm towel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4747726_relieve-growing-pains.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4747726_relieve-...</a>|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Maybe a hot bath and a massage b4 bed will help, that way her muscles are soothes and the massage will stretch them out..........good luck|`|4YqL4iCcaa	Sometimes I get cramps in my legs when my potassium is low, maybe give her a couple of bananas throughout the day. It helps me, and maybe it will help her! Good Luck!|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	regular massage- as in, by a massage therapist who has studied pediatric massage.<br>  <br>  But first, I'd get a CBC on her, because bone pain in a small child should NEVER be automatically dubbed 'growing pains'- I don't want to panic you but I have seen too many parents told their children had growing pains, only to find out months later that the child had leukemia or bone cancer- precious months which could have been spent in treatment.<br>  <br>  Could it very well be growing pains?<br>  Absolutely.<br>  But to say that without checking, when bone/ muscle pain is a main symptom of pediatric cancer, is unethical- especially in a child as young as yours.
IOp3knBjaa	Your doctor will tell you. A good sign for me that I was dilating was I had alot of pressure "down there". I told my doctor about it each time and sure enough I was dilated a little. This may not be the same for everyone, but definitely has been for me. I will say just in case don't try to check yourself. It could introduce bacteria into an otherwise sterile environment. If there is something that is making you think you may be dilated tell your doctor you would like to be checked. I had an appointment last Friday and I have been having a little bit of pressure and told my doctor and he told me just to let them know if I would like to be checked and it would be no problem. Hope this helps ya! Best of luck!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	If the doctor or midwife examines you and tells you so.<br>  <br>  (But being dilated means nothing at this point. It won't tell you when  you're going to go into labor.)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Spotting, pain during sex. <br>  <br>  If you think you may be and have been spotting go to your doctor so they can be sure.|`|AA12395149	You can't really know for sure without having a pelvic exam.  If you're not contracting, you're probably not dilating (though you may be contracting and not even realize it, then, you may be dilating...nice and confusing, right?)<br>  <br>  It's usually a pretty safe bet that you're opening if you start having mucus with blood.  Just a little pink, you're probably just starting.  If there's a pretty good amount of blood, you're probably pretty well open.  Again, these thoughts aren't exact, every pregnancy and every laboring woman is different, but this is the majority of what I've seen at my hospital.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend going to the hospital just to see if you're open though.  When you have regular contractions, blood like the second day of your period, or if your water breaks, definitely go and get checked out.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and congrats on being almost done!|`|AA11208683	well i would wait for your next appoitment to see by the doctors if you are dilated, but a couple ways to tell would be if you lost your mucus plug yet, that means you are dialating. other wise you can feel up there with your finger if you can reach and see if it opening up a little, if its open it will feel almost like you put your finger in between your lips when you pucker up for a kiss. but be careful if you do this, you don't want to go up to far or do something that would make you go into labor, be nice and gental.... i hope this helps. good luck!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I Think the only people who can tell is your gyno or the nurse.  I am 36 week pregnant right now and my this week visit my gyno check me if If I was started to dilated.  And I see that your due date is very close to mine so I guess in your next visit you can ask her to check you.
dlOFWcU4aa	Strange, but I experienced spotting last night too!  Around midnight.  Pinkish discharge once when I wiped.  Nothing for the rest of the night and nothing today.  I am having some mild cramps and just generally feeling BLAH.  Let me know how things go with you and if you decide to test.  Good luck and baby dust to you!<br>  misschellelynn@yahoo.com|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you should go and see your doctor. you may be pregnant again. and if you are you are going to want to get all the help so you won't miscarry again. best of luck.|`|AA11116434	What cycle day are you? Day 7-10 is the most likely to see implantation spotting if you were pregnant. I never had any spotting with 2 pregnancies. Also, no one i know personally ever had implantation spotting- even though it can happen. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12112190	I am so very sorry for your loss ,as I understand it you are a bit more fertile after mc so its very possible that was in fact implantation I would pray and relax and wait until about 5 days b4 af is due and test Good Luck and God Bless you!!!!!
GIlTkQu6aa	first of all i want to say dimetre it looks like your house is a little violint and you seem like an exallent parent. i have seen your ?s. i think you need to set some ground rules. i would get a family meeting and make up some rules (listen to their opinions and ideas but remember you dont have to agree, your the parent or guardian.) stay calm in this meeting. if they fight during, pull them closer to you and sit them on your lap. you are their father and their mother so that means one part of you needs to love, and the other part of you needs to be firm. when you discipline them, remember that their is disciple which means to teack in that word.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	Instead of worrying about punishment you should be concerned about what is causing this behavior. He needs an assessment by a qualified child psychologist. In the meantime you need to protect your sister by making sure they are never left without adult supervision, and explain to him why you have that rule.|`|IJwlglqaaa	i say do it back to him so he knows the feeling that hes makeing his sister feel|`|OI3bf4yjaa	He's hitting her with belts and wood? Holy cow. I would suggest taking privileges away for sure, like television, video games etc etc. He needs to EARN those things back. The next time you catch him in the act of hitting her, yes give his butt a good spanking! You can try putting him in a corner.. just make him sit there. That works really good...kids HATE when they have to sit in a corner for a long period of time. (The kids I've dealt with at least). <br>  <br>  I wish you luck.. especially your poor sister! The pretending to be arrested is actually a GREAT idea, that would scare the crap out of him and teach him his lesson!|`|foJm2Yftaa	I would try pretend arrested. he needs to learn a lesson or 2. When he HITS his sister with a belt and wood he doesn't know how it feels and a little lesson WITH spanking would teach him.|`|5NiF431Gaa	i think it would teach him a lesson if he got pretend-arrested but i can see how some people would find that pretty harsh.|`|BZcVLM8faa	pretend arrest that would teach him his lesson|`|6ReruqPgaa	Yeah i would go with the scare straight tactic.I am not a fan of hitting as a punishment for hitting, do spank that *** under diffrent situations, 'spare the rod, spoil the child'. But he is at a pivotal age and hitting him could send the wrong message and soon he will be to big for you to spank and if thats the base of your discipline you will lose his respect. Take things away from him too. And make him work for it back, by doing chores and being nice to his sister. JUST WATCH NANNY 911 when you get a chance.|`|oiJITSNZaa	if you spank, spank in love not anger. Let him know that such actions bring consequences. This may be how he is reacting to his parentless status and is taking it out on his sis. Do you make sure you take time for one on one time with him each day? Don't just brush him off. He may be feeling left out...you are spending all your time with your gf and her life for example. He needs lots of love and TLC. Don't just yell, and kick him around do things with him such as go to the playground, the mall, movies, help with homework and take an interest in his life if you are claiming to being his parent figure. Good luck...and don't be so hard on him!|`|wa5wOaqtaa	I am a single dad of a 9 year old boy. We all have choices which have consequences both good and bad, including children. The answers you are looking for are much too complicated to answer here. There are a couple guys that have a series called parenting through love and logic. Thewy have videos, books, etc.. About four years ago I took some parenting classes that taught their principles. There is no shame in taking parenting classes because the desire to become a better parental figure comes from love. I took these classes on my own and it has helped me more than I can ever explain. Please seek help. This is their website... <a href="http://www.loveandlogic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.loveandlogic.com/</a> Go buy their books or check them out from a library. Watch their videos. Parenting is not easy, and if you don't learn how, you will head down a road you don't want to go. If you post your location, I will gladly do some research and find help in your area. I wish you the best!!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You may not hit, spank, or otherwise lay a hand on his body.   Especially if you are a cop and want to keep your job.<br>  <br>  Right now, you need to keep the two of them separated at all times, he needs counseling and so does the sister.   Since you do not witness what occurs and can not be sure of what she did it's unreasonable to hold him entirely at fault, they both need to get some discipline for the behavior.   You can take away their privileges (no television/games/computer for this amount of time), restrict movement (ground them), deny them the ability to go on school outings or special things they usually enjoy.<br>  <br>  Your job as the parent for them is to be smarter then them, be good at knowing what is happening, remain calm even when it's heinous, and find creative tools for solving the problem.   They should be allied together against you, not against each other.   I suggest getting a DVD course from Lane Community College (Eugene, OR) by Carol Lynn Morse, she's Adlerian via Druikers, a child raising theory that uses natural consequences, and invest in therapy for the two kids you have.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	I think that pretend-arresting him would help him realize that he is doing wrong. Sending him away won't do him any good; he'll just do it somewhere else. Spanking him won't teach him anything, nor will a time out. I think you should call the cops and tell them everything, and allow them the arrest him (pretending) or if they want to take him to juvenile hall. He shouldn't be doing that to your sister...
mvKbfkhGaa	This is normal...(wait for the thumbs down). Both my cousin and my sister wet the bed until they were 12. IN some cases they will grow out of it, but their could be something wrong. If you bring it up in the next doctors check up they'll take care of it. They may offer you "vibvibratorsthey will vibvi berateen the child starts to pee and get their clothes wet. Until then good nights work remarkably well and they will keep them form getting the sheets and everything wet and by wearing them they can just throw them away once they wake up. Are they drinking lots of beverages when they go to bed? Make sure they stop drinking about 2 hours before bedtime and make them go to the bathroom before they go to bed. Don't worry, they will EVENTUALLY grow out of it...=]|`|z0ro3VkJaa	It can be a symptom of the child undergoing a period of extreme stress or anxiety. And if I remember correctly, you are the guy who is looking after your siblings because your parents died. How long ago was that?<br>  <br>  If it was fairly recently, that may be an issue, and it would help to get them some counseling. Schools normally provide grief counseling opportunities free of charge if money is an issue.|`|25yqbW2laa	Try all the advice they say and no diapers .Its already uncomfortable to them .Take them to the dr if it goes on|`|KP8OzOI0aa	No fluid 2 hour before they hit the hay<br>  and check on them like ever 3hour and <br>  ask if they need to use the restroom|`|ZZN3c5vNaa	When I was younger I had the same issues. I pee'd the bed until I was about 9 or so. It could be quite embarrassing and it would make it hard for me to sleep over at my friends house's. My mum decided to take me to a specialist. He had no logical diagnosis but I took different medications I also tried this machine which I would sleep ontop of and if it detected a liquid then it would make an alarm and it would wake me up and make me go to the toilet. I'm not sure if this helped answer your question but I think if you take them to your general doctor and he/she refers you to a specialist in about 3 months your problem should be solved :)|`|MNSzXT6Maa	That is very weird (no offense). Thirteen? Just try to teach him to wake up in time to go to the bathroom. If that fails, you REALLY should take him to the doctor.|`|DkEnwnrLaa	I would take them to a Dr  because it sounds like there bladder is not developed  or maybe  there kidneys|`|r86HhwhBaa	No drinks after 6pm at night and make them go to the toilet before bed.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Take them to a doctor, a 9 year old is not normal but a 13 year old there is something wrong there|`|J7GTIE5raa	If these are your kids, dont give them anything after 8pm at night and make sure they use the bathroom b4 bed.
viGqMW1Xaa	u could try tiring him out throughout the day so that way when night comes, it will be very hard for him to stay up. are his naps ending at a good time?|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	So if Im understanding this correctly your saying he wont stay asleep for naps? Im assuming he isnt tired, I dont see any point in forcing a child to take a nap if they arent tired. I have a 2yr old and most times he will nap later in the evening. We are on a later than normal schedule. If we are in the car around 7ish he will fall asleep in the car. Not a big deal to me I find most times he wants to nap later in the evening. Like I said we arent on most peoples schedule. Its midnight now and we are still up playing. I wouldnt put so much pressure on a nap.
dgRTkccBaa	Considering you're planning to travel next week I think the safest thing is to get checked out (it can only help).  I'm sure your doc has someone covering for her.<br>  BTW, it could be a small piece of your mucus plug that dislodged which is not uncommon.  Go get checked out, though.  it will ease your mind if nothing is wrong and if there is something to worry about you're better off catching it early. Good luck!!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	If your doctor is on vacation she should have someone else for her replacement.  Otherwise I would call hospital in labor and delivery department and let them check you out.  It is very early in the pregnancy so yes I don't think it is mucus plug, but I would still be concern.|`|7clS7baaaa	either way you are WAY to early to be having your baby.  you are not to be bleeding when you are pregnant.  it does sound like the mucus plug (or part of it) but you need to make for sure.  better safe than sorry.  since your doctor is not in, are there any other doctors there you can go see.  my doctor practices with 2 others so if mine is not in, the other docs will look at me.  otherwise until the dr visit, make sure to monitor your contractions (you should NOT be having more than 4 in an hour), watch to make sure you are not bleeding any more.  it sounds like today is a day you should put your feet up and relax.  if you get even more stressed out about this, is not good for the baby.  you should know your body so if theres something odd going on you dont think is right, then go get it checked out.  good luck and God bless.babies are little miracles|`|AA11208683	mucusy discharge is normal for pregnancy because your hormones change and they make more to protect from infection, but it should not be red or any color at all. sometimes this happens if you have sex... but you loseing your plug if it was doesn't mean your going to have the baby right away it could mean a couple of weeks till you have it but every one is different. i would still call someone like the hospital and just talk to a nurse.... and yeah you are early but it happens hun... my mom works in the NICU and she is taking care of babies that were born at 22 weeks so you arn't alone in this. loseing you plug just usually means that your body is getting ready to have the baby and you are dialating. but one of my friends just had her baby and she was dialating for 2 1/2 weeks.... everyone is different. id call someone just to be sure. i hope this helps... good luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My doctor is on maternity leave so I've been seeing other doctors in the office. If you call the front desk, and tell them you need to speak with another doctor. Tell them what you're going through and all the symptoms and you can get in there. You definitely want to see the doctor before you leave for NY. <br>  <br>  Earlier this week I was in my 28th week and had some slight spotting a few hours after a brisk walk. I called my stand in doctor and they had me go in the next day. They figured out I wasn't dilating and my cervix wasn't bruised. They figured it was from sex from the day before the spotting or from the brisk walk. I was told to take it easy.|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	Just go to the emergency room! It could be the begining stage of pre-term labor
pdPX1Pt6aa	yes i do think that the fathe rshould bear some the responsiblity in this matter he is at folt for have the gun in an exsesible place. but the boy should and im shore does know the difference between right and wrong. For a child of 11 to do some thing so sinister and know what he was doing the child has to be truly evil|`|uGqYoZNEaa	At first I thought no, because it was said that he had used that gun for hunting.  As more facts came out, such as the blanket made it premeditated and that he had threatened her, I think the father should be held responsible.<br>  <br>  An 11yo is old enough to know the difference between killing and just trying to hurt someone.  It's just a sad situation for everyone and I hope he gets the help he deserves.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	If in fact the guns were stored negligently, then I think the parents bear responsibility for that.<br>  <br>  But I don't think jail time is really the solution to all problems or mistakes.  I'd guess the guy has probably learned his lesson on that one.  I don't really see what sending him to jail accomplishes, unless it's perhaps deterrence for the next person.  I'd sentence him to community service going around telling people about the need to lock up their guns....|`|prqrQcd1aa	I agree with you. I think he should be charged with at least some sort of child endangerment, negligence or something...and like des said, make him do community service going around telling people the dangers of guns that aren't locked up around children.<br>  <br>  But..alass, according to our laws in this state the father will not be charged.. The district attorney in the case is even at a loss for what to do with this kid because of the laws in our state.. look up the pittsburgh post they are trying to look at all their options with him.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I don't know anything about that boy, or what his dad did or did not teach him... I can say he's old enough to know not to kill, but he probably doesn't fully grasp the idea of consequence for this crime.<br>  <br>  Dad was irresponsible for not keeping it all locked up... Crap like this just shouldn't happen. A lot of lives were ruined, from one gunshot blast. (I think it was one.)<br>  <br>  But, to the people who say he should be sentenced to death, well, they rarely even do that to ADULT child-killers, so it's not going to happen, here.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I completely agree. If the gun wasn't easily accessible this may not have happened.<br>  <br>  My husband has a concealed weapons permit and keeps it in the safe. No way would we ever let our child have access to it.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	I agree 100% .. except for the father doing the time. I think his right to bear arms should be voided and not be allowed to own weapons since he doesn't know how to store them properly but not jail time.|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	i definitely think that if the father did not store the gun properly then he should be help responsible for negligence.  However, i do not think that any sort of a manslaughter charge should be given to the father.  i think the boy needs to hold the blunt of the responsibility.  he is old enough to know right fro wrong and that it is not ok to kill people.  i know 7 year old who know not to point a bb gun at a person (though i do not agree with any child being taught how to use a gun even a bb) so an 11 yr old should know what they did and what would happen as a result of shooting the gun.

You'd definitely have to change his last name though, he'd be in for a lifetime of suffering with a name like " HARRY PETERS" If "HAIRY," comes to mind when I hear the name "HARRY," you have to know what comes to mind when I see the name PETERS! You know I am not the only one thinking this way about the name " HARRY PETERS," as immature as it may be, but this is a child you're naming who will grow up and go to school with other children, and children tend to be....... what's the word here ?<br>  .......oh yeah......IMMATURE.!<br>  <br>  Dory is a GIRL's name!-Enough said.<br>              &<br>  And Percy is very wimpy.

I can just see him taking out the "de" at school. Because people won't be calling him "Vol de Peters", they'll be calling him "Vol de". And it's not exactly like Harry Potter will just die off and be forgotten in a decade or two. So chances are high of him being teased at school and being called "Voldemort", which I'm not sure you'll want (and I'm sure he won't want).<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|CR1ierLVaa	WOW... i think the theme is creative but your boy will get made fun of so much so i like the Percy Peters the best because you know what the meaning is behind it but most people will not understand the meaning enough to make fun of him...
veO1RXrCaa	I agree with the other poster.  If baby is a flasher/wants to let you know,  you will know.  I have had 3 scans.  2 when the baby was big enough to determine sex and I was let in the dark both times.  Once he or she kept their legs crossed tight through the whole scan.  I had drank a bottle of o.j and a can of coke and nothing helped.  I had another last week at 36 weeks pregnant and the baby had his or her bum pressed against my ribs and upper body.  A friend of mine had a scan at the same time and was able to see that she was having a girl.  If you find out great but waiting is awesome too!  I had to wait to see what my son was too.  The doctor yelling Its a boy!  Was one of the greatest moments of my life.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	If you can already feel your baby than try those methods now to see if they work for your baby.  For my ultrasound at 21 weeks I ate a bit of cotton candy before going in and it worked for me.  But I tried that again at another appointment and it did nothing!  The appointment after that one I ate sugar snap peas and cherry tomatoes and he was moving pretty good.  I think it varies by baby!  <br>  <br>  So try eating something sweet with a drink of orange juice, drinking some really cold water, drinking a bit of pop, or anything that you have found to work to get the baby moving if you can feel him/her already!  <br>  <br>  Good luck with the baby and the ultrasound!  I hope you get a clear view!! :)|`|ykP7I3caaa	Fluids. Not because they make him or her active, but to fill your bladder pushing the uterus forward. If they are taking measurements etc. [which they did for me] the whole ultrasound took about an hour and gave the baby plenty of time to move around. He was aggravated by all the prodding and was pretty active :]|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My baby is super active since the beginning. Th cord was going through her legs and she was squirming all over the place, so they couldn't find out what the gender was. I actually had to go back later in the day to find out the gender. <br>  <br>  I asked the ultrasound tech if OJ would work to have her get into the right position and she said OJ doesn't work any better than cold water. Drink anything COLD before you go, or while you're waiting.|`|uuHPneEcaa	the only thing i did was drink lots of water. had a full bladder. and he moved alot. and they where able to tell I was having a boy! My doctor told me to only drink clear liquid. that way they can see it better. <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	Unfortunately baby has all the control in this situation.<br>  <br>  if he/she wants to show you he/she will<br>  <br>  sorry!|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Drink juice or soda just to make sure your baby is up and moving.  Sometimes they can be sleeping and curl up where you can not see.  I drank a small glass of juice and another small glass of soda before my appointment and she was moving like crazy, and we got a definite shot.  Good luck!|`|YLXpwqceaa	Okay, I had to have many nonstress tests twice a week for 15 weeks where they measure the baby's heart rate and activity.  They had me eat either a piece of chocolate, some cheese and crackers, or peanut butter crackers, and a little juice box.  It worked like a charm everytime.  When I didn't eat before hand, she wouldn't move.<br>  <br>  So it works!  Good luck!|`|DutTBV3caa	well i dont know for sure but doesnt eating sugary things keep baby active? maybe you could eat something sugary before hand so the baby will be active? like i say i'm not sure about it but i guess its worth a try right? lol|`|mVD3TQkFaa	You can drink oj I heard this gets the baby moving. I drank a small cup of coffee to get the baby moving before I went. I would try the oj or a little caffeine to wake baby up.|`|sEihaeLNaa	drink orange juice 1 hr before the appt. or can also try drinking a bit of soda and some candy. Anything with sugar, it makes the baby active. Good Luck!!!!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Usually having a glass of cold water wakes the baby up.  So just  bring a cold water bottle with you.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I heard drinking OJ helps but I had to drink tons of water before going in and drinking another fluid was last on my list!!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	they may tell u but that doesnt mean they are %100 sure they told me boy at 21 weeks & girl at 25 weeks... unless she has a very clear clear pic but my doc had a clear pic too but it was wrong|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I got lucky and my little boy was just hanging out with his little legs wide open! lol...I did drink a small container of orange juice before I went in to keep him active, and it did help...but he wouldn't hold still for the rest of the anatomy scan lol.  Good luck!|`|tGCMLBF7aa	When I went for my anatomy scan with my lil one, I had a bottle of OJ and a chocolate bar. Supposedly it gets the baby active & moving. Must be true because my daughter showed us her goods right away! ^_^ Hope you get the sex you want! Good luck!!
wENdWT5kaa	No, i wouldn't hate her, i'd love her even more for feeling like she can open up to me. <br>  <br>  I would feel nothing besides love. <br>  <br>  No, i wouldn't feel like i have failed. Why would I?<br>  <br>  My daughter has 14 years to go before she reaches 16, but honestly, if she was bi or lesbian, i wouldn't care, she is my daughter, i love her more than life it self. I believe in unconditional love, and that is what she is going to get. Same goes for my son.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I would certainly not hate her or feel any sense of failure.  I would make sure she knows how to protect herself from pregnancy and STDs (as I would if she were straight), and welcome any loving and respectful partner that she chooses to bring home.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	I would love my daughter, and support her, whatever her personal sexual orientation.<br>  Sexuality is individual and genetic, it is nobody's fault and should be welcomed and celebrated as her individuality!|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I would support her. Its her choice and there is nothing wrong with it. Anyone who thinks there is is small minded and needs to wake up to our century.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	i would probably cry.|`|iAfmejYTaa	its life. deal with it|`|imFOUAMcaa	I believe that is some part of a teenage phase these days because when i was in high school all of a sudden all the girls that werent pregnant or in a relationship was either fully gay for the moment or bisexaul. But then the same ones within a couple of months willl be straight and dont do it no more. <br>  I would never even cross my mind to hate my daughter cause of her sexualty and i would feel just fine. I wouldnt even feel like i failed because you did not encourage her to do it and its not like she can not ever leave this phase and all i would do is just talk to her about protective sex more and get her checked out at the obgyn because she is at greater risk of catching a bug of any kind from male or female if she is now sexaully active|`|d7bJIgqlaa	I am not a parent so I cannot honestly and fully answer, but have a little insight, I think.  I have worked around allot of bisexual people and I really just don't think that it is a choice that is made.  I have never really thought that it was the way we are "supposed" to live, but someone could not change me and make me start to like the same sex so how could we change someone who does?  Is that making sense?  On another note, the Bible says not to judge, but to love.  Love her as you always have, pray for her and for you and whomever else it effects.  And as a source, and I hate to recommend lifetime, but I saw a great movie on there.  My husband said he saw it before too and I know he doesn't watch lifetime so it must be a decent movie. :)  Anyhow, it is called For the Love of Bobby.  It is about a couple who learn that their son is gay and it is such an eye opener.  Best wishes for a softened heart and the ability to love her more than ever!|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I love my children unconditionally and would never hate mine!!!!!!!!  They are who they are and they are entitled to be who they are...........I would absolutely not feel like I failed..............I can't say exactly how I would feel because I haven't gone through it, however my priority would be for my child to be happy and feel they can come to me with anything without me being judgmental|`|8CuQa2OJaa	I can't beleive I need to say this to people who have been in the world longer than me. Love is love is love. The fact that it is 2 girls, or 2 boys should not matter AT ALL!<br>  <br>  It is not a CHOICE, like a lot of you are saying. I am bisexual and I have no control over it. I cannot just STOP liking girls too, or boys even fpr that matter. <br>  <br>  I would never hate my child, if I had one. It's good to be open, it means she can trust you. Let her be who she is, accept it. It's not a bad thing.|`|mFvtaOYCaa	oK, UR asking me if I would hate my daughter, think that I failed?<br>  What the HELL! any parent who would think that has no heart. I would love my kid no matter what. I would be proud of anything she wanted to do or become. I wouldnt think I "failed!" because my daughter was bisexual, But I sure would have thought I failed if I began to hate her.|`|l1STgPyRaa	i would hope that she could in time pick ether straight or lesbian as at lest then she would be more excepted by one of the community and is not as open to std's and such but it is her life as long as she was happy would not matter|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	I would be sad but i would love and support them no matter what. I love my child and by standing by their side and never letting them fell lonely|`|UkJU2ADcaa	The movie that Jennifer H is talking about is actually called "Prayers for Bobby"|`|XzJFr3tEaa	I would tell her I still love her no matter what she decides.
5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We have done it on very little - less than 20k. 25k is more comfortable.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	We live on only $27000 a year in Kansas City. You can make changes to make it work if you are willing to. It's not easy but we can do it. I also watch one little girl part time for extra cash. It's not a lot but it helps.<br>  <br>  We do own a house and two cars as well.|`|l0ZuV1yaaa	I was a stay-at-home mom when my husband was in graduate school.  Our income was $20,000 a year, and we had a 1-year-old.  We were able to save $3,000 a year on that income.  It's a matter of priorities.  Most people could cut a lot of expenses from their budget if they chose to, especially with the wife at home.<br>  <br>  One example is in the grocery budget.  Making more foods from scratch saves a lot of money, as does shopping sales, buying cheaper foods, which doesn't mean unhealthy.  Cabbage and carrots are much cheaper than salad and tomato (unless on sale) for instance.  We spend $450/month on groceries for 2 adults and 5 children ages 7 1/2 years down to 1 1/2 months.  That's less than a lot of families with only 1 or 2 young children spend.<br>  <br>  We are committed to my staying at home.  The salary is not an issue; we would make whatever salary work.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	That really depends on where you live, how many children you have, and how much you own and owe.  Sure, some families of 3 can live on $20,000 a year but that's far too close to living at poverty level than I would be comfortable with (poverty lever for a family of 3 is just over 17,000).  If you want to save for your child(ren) to go to college, you'd have to take that into account.  Ten years ago, when my daughter was a toddler, she and I lived fine on $27,000 a year.  I didn't have much in the way of savings, though, and I'm not a big spender.  And that was 10 years ago.  I wouldn't feel safe being a stay-at-home mom unless my husband was making a minimum of $60,000 a year to support me and my 2 children.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I work at home as a mary kay director and don't depend on my husband.. (even though he makes a lot of money)   If you want to stay at home, its up to you to make it possible! :)|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Its called priorities.  Do you really need cable tv and to go on expensive trips and eat out at elaborate restraunts.  I stay hom and we make around $75,000 a year.|`|VbdBxVLvaa	You have to make a solid budget and live within your means.  It is going to be worth it.  Your babies are only babies once and you can never go back.  You have to have faith in your husband's ability to be a great provider, but you also need to encourage him and help him along the way.  I am in the process of making a budget myself as I am about to quit my job in a couple of months to be a stay at home mom.  I think it's great that he wants you to stay home.  I had to do a little convincing!!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	You can be a stay at home mom on a 30,000 a year salary as long as u prioritize u cant get ur nails done or ur hair every week or buy stuff when ever you want ...You just got to stick with ur budget....My husband makes well over 30,000 a year and he wanted me to stay home with our son so instead of fully staying home i work like 10 hours a week  just so i can have some extra things in life.|`|CIgslc2Uaa	Make sure all of your bills (mortgage, cars, credit cards, etc.) can be paid with only his salary.  Try a month of just living on his salary, except child care which obviously you won't be paying once you quit your job. If you can do it for an entire month, on only his income, its enough.  That's what my husband & I did when we thought about me staying home. We had to make some changes to our lifestyle, we go out less now but it is well worth it!
V56JyMIUaa	'Medical abortions' are non-surgical abortions that use pharmaceutical drugs, and are only effective in the first trimester of pregnancy.[citation needed] Medical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the United States and Europe.[citation needed] Combined regimens include methotrexate or mifepristone, followed by a prostaglandin (either misoprostol or gemeprost: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention. Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.<br>  <br>  Surgical<br>  A vacuum aspiration abortion at 8 weeks gestational age (6 weeks after fertilization).<br>  1: Amniotic sac<br>  2: Embryo<br>  3: Uterine lining<br>  4: Speculum<br>  5: Vacurette<br>  6: Attached to a suction pump<br>  <br>  In the first 12 weeks, suction-aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method. Manual Vacuum aspiration (MVA) abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) abortion uses an electric pump. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "menstrual extraction", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP). From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, dilation and evacuation (D&E) is used. D&E consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.<br>  <br>  Dilation and curettage (D&C), the second most common method of abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. Curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the uterus with a curette. The World Health Organization recommends this procedure, also called sharp curettage, only when MVA is unavailable. The term D and C, or sometimes suction curette, is used as a euphemism for the first trimester abortion procedure, whichever the method used.<br>  <br>  Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second trimester. Premature delivery can be induced with prostaglandin; this can be coupled with injecting the amniotic fluid with caustic solutions containing saline or urea. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by intact dilation and extraction (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus' head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "partial-birth abortion," which has been federally banned in the United States. A hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section, and is performed under general anesthesia because it is considered major abdominal surgery. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  From the 20th to 23rd week of gestation, an injection to stop the fetal heart can be used as the first phase of the surgical abortion procedure to ensure that the fetus is not born alive.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	it can be done quiet a few way's please contact your local health department to find out! this is the pregnancy section and it should be posted in womens health|`|AA11521906	i know of three ways<br>  <br>  1.

There's no need to mess with the spelling of a child’s name. It's annoying to those reading it and annoying for the child when she has to constantly correct people. It also looks tacky. If you're naming your daughter Emily, don't spell it Emmaleigh.<br>  <br>  3. It's easy to live with. This means that you shouldn't name your kid something that people will automatically judge them for. What kind of kid to you think Styla Beautyful would be? How about Laquisha Jayne? Give your daughter a name that she can mold to fit her personality, not a name she has to live up to. <br>  <br>  4. You are comfortable with all aspects of it. Go check the history, the meaning, the popularity. Make sure you love every aspect of the name before choosing. It would be terrible if you named your daughter Madison, then 2 weeks down the line you look it up finally and realize that it means “SON of Maude” and is the most popular name in America right now. Suddenly, you regret naming your daughter what you did.<br>  <br>  It’s really hard to suggest names with such a vague description. What are some names that you know you like? What boy names do you have?|`|DWLfKACYaa	Joanna Beck<br>  Lara Beck<br>  Tessa Beck<br>  Hanna(h) Beck<br>  Sarra Beck<br>  Rachelle Beck<br>  Rochelle Beck<br>  Roxanne Beck<br>  Roxanna/Roxana Beck<br>  Amy Beck<br>  Elissa/Elyssa/Elissah/Elyssah Beck<br>  Natania/Natanya Beck<br>  Alivia Beck<br>  Annie Beck<br>  Hope Beck<br>  Josie Beck|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Avaleigh.<br>  Annaleigh.<br>  Camden.<br>  Oriana.<br>  Alisa.<br>  Zarah.<br>  Zana.<br>  Lya.

AA11116434	2 pregnancies, no signs or symptoms at all, except a missed period and at about 2 weeks along, fatigue. Never got spotting, cramps, sore bb's. Nothing.|`|KvxHpiujaa	Yes when I implanted with my daughter I had cramps that felt just like period cramps and a pink discharge only one time when I wiped. So good luck to you, and baby dust to you as well!!|`|Kp6LX1JVaa	With my son, I had implantation bleeding.  It was just like you are describing.  But my periods were never normal, I just thought that I was about to get my period, but nothing more then a tiny bit of spotting. Since it was right before my wedding I figured it was stress, found out I was pregnant three days before my wedding, lol.  I would wait a week and get a early pregnancy test.  Good luck to you. :)|`|NNwEuC8paa	Sounds like it could be implantation bleeding and that can have cramps as well. Did you have any other colored spotting or just light pink spotting?
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are many perks, delay in getting your period back, the fact that its free, the fact that the poop doesn't stink.<br>  <br>  The one for me that most people aren't aware of is it makes my hay fever less severe.  <br>  <br>  (And yes exclusively pumping is ridiculously hard, I'm very proud that you stuck with it.  But this is why I tell women that its not a decision you should make lightly, its not easier to exclusively pump so you "know how much baby is getting" or because you aren't sure "breastfeeding is right for you" or worse because "my boobs are for my husband" -gag)<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  I'm not saying this to guilt you, I'm just saying this in case you have another baby and it has a tongue tie (and it does run in families) as long as a tongue tie is corrected within the first two weeks its a very minor procedure, in fact most midwives used to do such procedures at home, at birth, and wouldn't have considered charging for it.  Many midwives are no longer trained in it, but some are, and some family doctors.  Again they would do it as part of a normal office visit and shouldn't charge much.  So I would look into different health care options next time, even if you don't birth with a midwife some will do well baby check ups particularly if you have special concerns ahead of time.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You are not 'breastfeeding' if you are pumping. You are 'breastmilk feeding.' You are not 'exclusively' pumping if you still nurse 1-2 times a day.<br>  <br>  Minor quibbles. But. Why go on about 'making the decision to use em for what God gave em to us for' if you are mostly pumping? <br>  <br>  I mean _no_ offence to pumping mothers, who work hard for their babies' sakes. But if you can nurse, why not nurse?|`|UghJ0XROaa	Selfish things really-the close bond i have with my daughter, knowing that when she is hungry only mommy will do, and when i go into the baby aisle looking at the extreme costs of formula, i am so thankful that i don't have to buy that every week|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Its free<br>  night feeds you can do in your sleep!<br>  I can go anywhere, anytime & not have to worry do I have a bottle with me.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I also pump exclusively. I think one of the biggest perks is knowing that my child is getting the best form of nutrition there is. I also like the fact that it helps drop the baby weight! That's a good one, too!<br>  <br>  I just want to comment to "Do your own thinking!": Did you ever consider that sometimes feeding from the breast is not an option for some? I have to pump my breastmilk and feed my children from a bottle but that does not in any way make me less of a "breastfeeder" than someone who is putting their child to their breast, in the end the child is getting the same nutritious milk, aren't they?|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I bf my 6 yo until he was 2........free, so convenient especially at night, he's never been sicker than having a cold.<br>  <br>  Bfing my 14month old and again, it's free, so convenient and she's also never been sick.  I had to bottle feed her for 3 days (breastmilk) and it was such a hassle.  So many bottles and so much wasted milk which I worked over 3 weeks to save up!<br>  <br>  I think it's great when moms choose to breastfeed.  You're right our *perks* are what we were given to naturallly feed children!  I also feel it makes mother/child have such a strong bond.  From friends who have children the same age as my oldest the ones who bf feel they are still more closer to their children than friends who opted to bottle feed.|`|Nb0Gxvsyaa	Let's see ... my son poops constantly and I still get my period SO hmmm!<br>  <br>  Perks:<br>  I know I am giving my son the best nutirtion available and he is better able to fight off any sickness that he may be exposed to.  It is bonding time with my son.  I actually do love knowing that our bodies are still connected like when he was inside of me.  This is actually a beautiful thing that I never realized I would feel.  It is also actually pretty convenient because I don't have to mix and make bottles, etc. but really I could do that without too much trouble anyhow.  Really, just knowing I am doing the best for my son.|`|AA11296044	For starters the cost - I had twins and for the first 6 months feeding them was entirely free.<br>  <br>  As it also worked out I never had a constipated or overly gassy child.   I also experienced the lack of poopy diapers, only 1-2 per week per child.<br>  <br>  Rarely were my boys sick either.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	The thing I enjoyed to most out of breastfeeding my kids is looking at them after a certain time...in awe of how big they have gotten on just my milk alone. It still to this day amazes me that they can double their birth weight on milk that I have made.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	The closeness with my baby. I honestly don't have much of a choice, we can't afford the cost of formula right now with my hubby being laid off. I also love knowing that I am doing the best thing for my son.|`|dI664zW0aa	Well my list could go on and on <br>  <br>  my favorite is the face he makes when hes at the breast I swear I can literally feel my heart melting.|`|59821ioeaa	I had a c-section and the doctor said breastfeeding helped with my healing, it also helped me loose weight ALOT faster|`|vue9NOhYaa	Extreme convenience.<br>  Lots of money saved. (Both directly in not having to buy formula, and indirectly in better health, so fewer doctor visits. My entire cost outlay was a couple of nursing bras.  I never bought a pump or a boppy pillow or special nursing clothes.) <br>  Knowing that I was giving the best I could provide for my baby.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yup, once a week for one son when nursing - the other was far more frequent.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed not messing with bottles and kids that get fewer colds/illnesses.
QP46eVi4aa	you are supposed to take it the same time every month to help ovulate <br>  <br>  <br>  i have took it twice with getting pregnant twice with it<br>  <br>  but take it the same time or if you have questions like that it is best to call the doctor <br>  <br>  but i was told the same time every month|`|k3V2CA81aa	It dosn't matter. There is some speculation that CD5-9 produces less but more mature follicles and CD3-7 produces more but less mature follicles. There is no proof to that though.|`|5fiIvGMHaa	Check with the docs I have been told 2-6|`|AZRj3vaLaa	are you taking it on your own?<br>  I would do exactly what your doctor says<br>  they usually prescribe it for the days theyve seen have more success!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	You can take it either days, I took it 5-9 then 2-6 and waiting for my BFP!
M1KYxcvSaa	TMI - We don't need to know every time you had sex.  If you had sex, then pregnancy is a possibility.  If you were taking the pill correctly, then your odds are lowered, but it's still a possibility.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I freaking hate those "could I be pregnant" questions if you had sex then yes you could be pregnant, I can't just magically tell if you are pregnant, I feel if you need to ask that question then you shouldn't be having sex.|`|3b5c1b2374e54df48a8dc857796172edaa	ok, first of all, if it showed up positive in the control - the test worked. That's what a control is. If you don't get a line at all then the test was no good, either because the test itself was defective, or because you didn't get enough urine on the stick. <br>  <br>  Second, if you had sex, you could be pregnant, just like the first person said. Even if you are using every form of birth control on the planet, it's possible. If you are concerned, then go see your doctor. I will let you know, however, that because you are coming off depo, and already are on another BC, the chances of you being pregnant are slim. But if you are on birth control pills, then your periods should have regulated pretty quickly, so I would still go see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Third, that discharge could also be from a yeast infection. Again, you should see your doctor to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  I guess my answer is - Go see your doctor, and tell him/her everything you said here!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Plain and simple: If you have sex, you could get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Even taking birthcontrol exactly like you supposed to isn't a sure thing.<br>  <br>  The control window ALWAYS shows up, it's there to let you now the test is working. The result window is where you want to be looking.|`|96e831baa272f7f9b2a90151f63bf4b4aa	The chance is always there.  I don't exactly get what you mean by the test was negative but positive in the control.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you could be pregnant. <br>  You should see a Dr.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Honestly, I would call and talk to your doctor.  There's no way anyone on here could tell you yes or no, but of course, there's always the possibility that you could be pregnant, since you're having sex.  Good luck!|`|D8vOpNWgaa	im not a dr and everyone is different but i have done the same thing as you. the first 3 months i did this i skipped about a hole month. i hoped i was pregnant and took a test for it to say no so i waited and my period came what sucked i had it for 2,5 weeks my dr said it was normal and not to expect my period to be come normal for about a year.  this is just me i say wait a lil if your period don't come in 5 days take another test if neg go see your dr.
3vWpUXsmaa	That is absolutely normal. Normal range is 0-20|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	You're fine.  That's a normal ESR level.|`|M8IrNU3Baa	Yes, anything under 20 mm/hr is considered normal for your age.|`|reFCzUnwaa	No thats a first
AA12033653	This really depends on how old the baby is.  If the baby is 6 months old it will eat a whole lot less than a baby that is 9 months old. <br>  <br>  To fully answer this question we need more info....How old is the baby, how long has it been eating solids etc.|`|sFGgPTk3aa	There are directions on the box that tell you how to make it for the first time.  After your baby has been eating it for a while, you slowly make it thicker and can add fruit to it as well.  You start out with a small amount on the spoon, the once they have eaten it for awhile, you can give them a little more on the spoon.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i started my son with 2 tbs of cereal with like 5 tbs of formula. now i mix a little cereal with stage 1 bananas and my son loves it.my son turned 4 months in feb|`|xuSEVdSAaa	When my son was 4 months old and constantly hungry I gave him about 2 teaspoons of baby cereal and mixed it with a jar of stage 1 baby food. Preferably fruit bananas or applesauce makes it taste really good. He's 6 months old now and he gets more but that's what I did. If you use formula to mix instead of baby food i used like 4 ounces maybe? I can't remember too well. Just mix the formula in with the 2 teaspoons until it's a rich creamy texture.|`|zHG5gjBZaa	read the box it should help you and if not there should be a number that you can call on the box. I know from my experience I just tried a tiny bit on the spoon and went from there.  When you are ready add vegetable (stewed) first not fruit as you are then going to have trouble introducing vegetables as children have a sweet tooth this I know because we did the wrong way around lol

SERIOUSLY!?!  Your girlfriend, the woman you presumably love or at least care about is carrying your child, may go through the most emotionally agonizing thing she could possibly do and you're concerned about how long you won't be gettin' any?  Sex should not be anywhere near the top of your list of concerns right now!  How about showing come concern and compassion for your girlfriend and her feelings.  Try asking how you can be of support to her.  You might even want to take a moment to consider the life of the child you created too.|`|C8JKsvdmaa	don't be so heartless you realise if your gf does this she has to live with it for the rest of her life and she probably will be really unhappy for awhile she will need love and support not someone wanting to know how soon he can get back in her pants. have you though about the fact that this is your child your talking about, it has a heartbeat, and limbs and a brain it already is a person. don't be irresponsible when it comes to sex, if you don't want a baby use protection.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I am a firm believer in Pro-choice, but those are not what you should be wondering about if you really care about her.<br>  <br>  You are thinking of spending money to fix something that I am hoping you are not ready to handle (that is why you are doing it right), but then all that is on your mind is how long til we can risk this again???<br>  <br>  If you are seriously thinking of going thru with this you should be worried about medical issues that could come up. There are serious complications that can happen when someone has a DNC or a abortion. <br>  <br>  Please don't reproduce and honestly, i hope your girlfriend dumps you and moves on to a man|`|dY5fM2vTaa	you want her to get an abortion but you want to know how long it will take to get back in her pants and knock her up again probally.

jr5EgB2Taa	Um, yea, if puke green was "glowing" yea, I sure did.<br>  Your hormones are all out of whack during the next many months.  Grin and bear it, because soon you are going to be holding a super cute baby that won't care at all.<br>  To treat the breakout, I would recommend some tea tree gel, as traditional anti-acne medication can cross the uterine wall.  Green tea will sooth, and calm the skin, and help fight future break outs.  I had to use it during my pregnancy and although it didn't work quite as well as the traditional medication, it was better than nothing!<br>  If you skin is really oily than use noxema or neutrogena as they are both fairly mild but help a lot.  Wash your face every night before bed, and the breakouts should start to clear up by month six.  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|UfhE3k1baa	I think the whole " glow" thing is a lie lol. Everyone says I look so happy, which I am. But I am broke out like I haven't been since I was 13 and going through puberty. My sking is dry, my hair is brittle and my cheeks are flushed all the time from throwing up, and not in a pretty natural blush kind of way.|`|27Gx5JUZaa	every pregnancy is different.. & a lot of woman do not get that pregnancy "glow".. because of all the hormone changes, some woman break out.. & the woman that already had problems with it, might break out more.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	uhhhg i am 15 weeks right now, and im trying to control my pimples now! a few weeks ago i broke out really bad... :[ i hate it! im waiting for that GLOWWW! lol|`|ZvkX9uNraa	Yes, I broke out so much on my chin and sides of my face and forehead.

a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	Hello to you,<br>  <br>  A positive line is a positive no matter how strong or faint it is, if you can see it then its a positive... The test you had at the GP came out negative because you might not of had enough of the HCG in your urine for their tests..<br>  <br>  Wait a couple of days and test again but it certainly sounds like apositive to me...<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope u get the answers stuff u really want|`|ZvkX9uNraa	It means that you did not pick up the hormone very strongly. However, any presence of the hormone indicates pregnancy.|`|EJl2RvDfaa	faded line is a line. So its positive.|`|ziw77iuPaa	You are definetly pregnant. In sign of a line indicates you have the HCG hormone it just may not be strong enough...<br>  <br>  I have commented on all your questions so good luck to you hun!!! wish u all the luck|`|5m5hfKrBaa	a line is a line as long as it has the die color to it... <br>  the line could also be lighter if you didnt take both in the morning... that is the best time to test...<br>  the test at home could be stronger then the one at the dr... i would wait and test in a few days and see if it gets any darker...|`|DiuDO1Weaa	pregnant hun!|`|Zvk9qyqqaa	congrats lol|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's possible the doctor's urine test needed more HCG to detect preganncy.|`|VbdBxVLvaa	you are pregnant!!! Congrats!
145RUNQHaa	Hi i answered your other question.i have a toddler son too and i would not consider keeping him in a playpen all day if nothing else your little nephew will have a developmental delay.it is not normal that he cries all day.CPS would not necessarily take the children away but you may need to contact them under these circumstances it sounds like a case of neglect.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	sounds like she needs her tubes tied<br>  <br>  call child protective services and your parents should apply for guardianship and she should terminate her parents rights|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Do you know if she's into drugs like the father is?<br>  Thank goodness you're there for these kids at least, even though you're young.  These kids need love, attention, nurturing, and the basics of being taken care of.  You see they're being neglected and not treated well, and I'm sure there are others in your family as well who see this.  Talk with your parents about what you can do about it.  <br>  If she (your sister) needs therapy, some sort of rehab or something, and she's unwilling, have a group intervention.<br>  Good luck.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I would think of those kids, first, and I'd call CPS... Older sister is well aware of what she's doing (and not doing), but those poor kids have no say.<br>  <br>  A 20-month-old child should NOT be in a playpen all day! Quite frankly, if she were my sister, I'd box her ears.|`|dpBKz5twaa	It sounds like you are trying to do the right thing.  This is a tough situation I would suggest you continue doing what you are and maybe talk with your parents let them know how you feel and see if ya'll can come to a solution.  Don't try to go at this alone, worst case scenario your parents agree to take the children and you have to call CPS so that you don't have to do the negotiating with your sister, they will do it for you.  Good luck and your nieces and nephew are lucky to have such a great Aunt.|`|YOgFXw1Gaa	well in my opinion i think you should call CPS even hough you may feel like your betraying your sister its the best thing to do and who knows it might set her straight|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Too long/boring. Didn't read......|`|0rAgtGNgaa	if you see she is not a fit mother than you need to call DHS (department of human services) and let the social worker evaluate the home
8MB8FtRxaa	It depends on how much blood is there. Same thing happened to me when I figured out i was pregnant with my daughter. I thought it was my period except it didn't last more then a day and it was not alot of blood at all. Wait about a week adn take a test if the bleeding is minimal!|`|4GnzqUxzaa	If it's plantation bleeding it will only last maybe an hour or so and it will be veryyy minimal. If it's lasted a day or two days it's a period.|`|MMx7TeEBaa	Your cycle could just be changing.<br>  I would wait another 2weeks until when your actual period is due and if nothing happens go see your doctor and they can do a urine test to see if you are pregnant.<br>  If you were pregnant it could be implantation but normally you wouldn't bleed for more than one day.<br>  hope you find out :)
hWc65sEtaa	I've never heard it call outer course before, that's funny.<br>  <br>  You can go to planned parenthood to get a test done.  I seriously doubt your pregnant though.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Okay, I can't tell you if you are or not, no one can. If there was sperm on his hands that got inside of you then there is a possibility. I would highly doubt you are but you need to get a test to check anyhow since you have missed your period and do have some symptoms. Don't worry about buying the test. No one knows how old you are and you wouldn't be the first teen to buy a pregnancy test for sure. Also, you could just go through the self-checkout lane and no one would even know. Good luck to you.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Chances are very very low, your just stressing thats probably why your periods late, you need to take whether you want to or not its the only way of finding out for definate. As Being bloated an extra discharge its a little early to be gettin symptoms like that if you were pregnant prob jus all in your head. Gud luck|`|C8JKsvdmaa	if you think your 8weeks already, you need to suck it up and get a test done, so you know one way or the other for sure. then you need to see a dr. you said there is only an 11% chance but all you need is one sperm and one egg to be pregnant , take a test and good luck.|`|tWD175Pjaa	talk to your school councillor he/she can buy a test for you and its completely confidential and no one will know and if you take the test and it comes back that you are they will be right there for you but to be honest there's very little chance that you are good luck sweety|`|w94WNRcdaa	im not really an expert but i think you should wait a while longer and see if your still missing your periods. and i know you really dont want to talk to your parents about this because it would really be hard n them and you. so all i can say is wait. and if abortion is on your mind then try REAL hard to get a pregnancy test because if your too far along then its too late. fye i dont believe in abortion but im not you so i cant say anything. i wish you good luck and hope your not expecting!|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	Well the only way to know for sure is to have someone of age to buy u a test or tell ur parents ur concern but by the sounds of it i don't think ur pregnant u probably missed ur period because ur stressed and discharge doesn't always mean pregnancy. just do the right thing and get a test or go see a dr|`|49b5ba8ebc375df56a073bff7c95e330aa	I was told sperm dies when it touches air. I Could be wrong tho. So get tested, now is a good time. You will get accurate results since it has been over a month.|`|4162d80c8a39f028f9a6fd1098d180fcaa	your probably not pregnant......although the stress of you thinking you are may be why you have not have a period yet.|`|Jjoh14Dcaa	just buy a test, at least you will know for sure. stress can put your period n hold. i highly doubt your pregnant.|`|V56JyMIUaa	dude, you don't have to be a certain age to buy a pregnancy test :/

8CTNzb6kaa	Nick as a nickname and Nicholas  Hancock is a very nice name .|`|9g734Pjaaa	I like Nick as a nickname, but not a given name. Would it be a short form of Nicholas? I do like the sound of Nick Hancock - kicky and cool! - and also Nicholas Hancock (ditto).|`|lYjweuZmaa	nick is  an ugly name|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Nicholas Hancock  with "nick" as a nickname?

DdLfaEzNaa	We try to do it whenever we can, but our problem is that DH works mostly nights and it's impossible to find sitters for during the day.  My parents live nearby and are willing for certain occasions, but they really would rather not be the "free baby-sitting service".  We have some friends with whom we occasionally do "baby-sitting exchanges" with--they watch our kids with theirs while we go out and the next time we watch theirs so they can go out.<br>  <br>  We don't have a lot of money to spend on a sitter AND a date, so we often just stay home and order take out and watch a movie or play a game after the kids go down.  I don't know why people think "going out" is so much better than that anyway.  We only "go out" about once every month, where we leave the kids with someone.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I have the hardest time leaving my daughter.. so my partner and I rarely have time alone. (Except for when she goes to bed). If we want to go out for the night, we usually let her grandmother watch her. If she's staying over at her grandmother's house, we try not to be later than 9:00 PM, because I'm still not comfortable with being away from her over night. It's not her grandmother, it's just that I'm not ready quite yet. <br>  <br>  I'm sure it just takes time.. and once I'm  comfortable enough to be away from my daughter.. I will only let someone watch her who I know personally.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	Well I have an on call sitter because I work different hours and so that isnt a problem. Also my kids have close relatives who visit very often.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	This is absoloute honest...my hubby and I have been out for dinner once since my 17 month old was born. Before that we went out the night I went into labour. My parent's in law baby sat a few months ago when I had to take the dog to the vet lol. <br>  We do make time to spend with each other at home though. We will have a bath together after the kids go to bed or we'll watch movies on the couch and cuddle. I guess it's not really the same though.|`|dgRTkccBaa	We shoot for once per month, but it doesn't always work out that way.  Sometimes we can't afford it and sometimes it's just not possible like if anyone gets sick or if hubby has to travel for business.  I have friends who don't go out at all, and I know others who manage to go out a couple of times per week.  I think it's important to have some adult time once in a while.  We love doing things with our kids, but sometimes it's nice to just be us again for a little while.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Since I had my twins in November my husband and I have gone out maybe 5times. Those few times my parents watch the girls. <br>  My husband is in Iraq for 8months so I won't be going out for a while. <br>  <br>  When I had my first my husband and I went out at least once a month or tried to. Even if we just had my parents or his parents watch our daughter.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	whenever we feel like it really but mostly because we always have either my parents or my brother and his wife watch our daughter for free..often we get my paretns to take dd overnight even!  yay!<br>  <br>  it can vary from 3-4 times in a month to not at all.. just depends on money and having somewhere we want to go really..  but that reminds me i want to go see watchmen this weekend.. gotta go call momma! :)|`|CFFuFof1aa	I only do it once a month. I can tell when I need a night out with my husband. I will start getting really moody, and stressed out. Then we will go out, and I will be ok for about a month. The only thing that stinks, is my husband works 6 days a week. He works about 9 or 10 hours a day. He is only off on Wed. We have a 18 month old little girl, and I have a 3 1/2 year old step son. He comes every week on Tuesday, spends the day with his daddy on Wednesday and then goes home on Thursday night. So when we do get to go out it jeopardizes his time with his son. So that's why we only go out once a month.|`|qbogLlFyaa	We only got 1 and hes five so it is alot easier for us to go out now but before that hadly ever cause i really dont like to leave him anywhere cause i dont like people to tell my kid anything like trying to dicipline him but now that hes older my brother can keep an eye on him cause he can do practicly everything by himself but he has never spent the night anywhere no matter how late it is when he wakes up he is with us i get teased alot about that to there like when are you gonna let him stay the night when he is in high school but im just not ready you should just put your baby to bed early and just hangout at home make a date there|`|17c9652c588d0895008ca5507d3558f9aa	My parents stay here about 6 months out of the year. They have a house less than a mile away. When they are here we usually get at least one night a week, but it is usually spent at home. We might go out every 3 or 4 months. <br>  <br>  When they are gone we don't get anytime alone unless he is sleeping . I don't have a babysitter and don't know anyone I can leave him with.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Roughly once a month..but we usually dint go out we just have a nice home cooked meal a bottle of wine or 2 and a dvd and a snuggle on the couch.....we rather stay in!!<br>  <br>  It has been known to be up to three times in one month BUT that was because i had 2 engagement parties and a 40th/21st on in one month and she only ever stays with my Mum and Dad and my BIL & SIL, i would never leave her with someone outside of family!|`|1WBimx1laa	Its actually very hard for us to find a babysitter. We got out maybe once every two months.|`|hq5cdDpwaa	2 times a year when we go to vegas and feb 19.|`|KHOsfLM9aa	once every six months or so...|`|y2uCUDvDaa	Once in every 2-3 months...
1uAduUKhaa	Most children can stay dry thru the nite by the time they turn 5.   Statiscally, girls mature faster than boys & about 5%-10% of boys still wet the bed until they are 10-12 years old.  <br>  <br>  I have a nephew who didn't out grow bed wetting until he was in the 5th grade and needed to wear a diapers to bed.  My nephew was  embarrased always was afraid that other children would make fun of him.   My sister and I were always loving and nurturing and  we encouraged him and made him realize that one day he would outgrow diapers but until he did, it was better for him to wear diapers and that it was better to have us change his wet diaper than to have to change wet bed sheets. <br>  <br>  Your son is only 3 and is still a toddler.  He probably just isn't ready to go without diapers so there is no point in rushing him.  Disposable diapers are expensive.  In order to save money, you might want to invest in a stack of cloth diapers, diaper covers, and baby pins.   I also recommend that you put plenty of baby oil and Desitin on the tender skin around his bum and peepee so that he doesn't get a rash.|`|AA11210211	Buy pull ups,if he is potty trained you really shouldn't be using diapers on him,my son is 3 1/2 fully potty trained except at night he wears a pull up and most nights he doesn't even wet in the pull up.I buy the really cheap ones at the dollar stores.It is normal for this to happen,I  wet the bed at night until I was about 12 and even now that I am 25 I still sometimes wet the bed when I sleep too hard.|`|4YqL4iCcaa	It's normal for some kids to wet at night...just know it's not his fault...You could look into buying some just pull ups for nights. Don't let him drink or eat for two hours before he goes to bed...that might help.|`|220b695ab00eca1c536e15d2f68abdd5aa	I was just at the doctor's yesterday and my 4 year old daughter still wets through the night.  Doctor said we don't worry about it until she's 6 and still doing it.<br>  <br>  That's good enough for me.  I'm not into worrying about things prematurely.  Honestly, I'm sure you have other things you could worry about.  Don't let this bother you and let it go for now.  I just make sure she wears a pull up to bed at night.  I wish I didn't have to keep buying diapers too, but it beats doing laundry every morning.<br>  <br>  Conversly, my son was dry through the night about a year before he was actually potty trained.|`|ip9DLteOaa	Get a new bed.-|`|UgZq1pXjaa	I have a 4 yr old that wears pampers size 7 disposable diapers every night for bed wetting.  I know your frustrations.  Its hard but you can't make a child stop wetting on command.  I also know this because I too was a bed wetter up to my teen years and its no fun.  I wore disposable diapers to bed until I was dry.  Its not his fault and I can tell you he's not doing it on purpose and if he is like my and my son being a heavy sleeper, you pee at night and never know what has happened.  You say you don't want to buy diapers any more but trust me I have a son like yours and I was a bed wetter, its better waking up in a wet diaper than wet bedding and wet pajamas.  Even putting a mattress cover like some suggested make you have to do laundry every night and he is waking up in nasty pajamas.  And for the record when others say don't use diapers use pull-ups or good-nights, Pull-ups and Good-nights are diapers.  They pull-on instead of being tapped on.  I chose to keep using the tape tab diaper because they fit better than the pull on diapers but I think you should keep using diapers until he grows out of it.  He will get it eventually, he wont be going to High school in diapers......lol.....|`|fmsKNGMEaa	Yeah, it really isn't anything you can help at that early of an age, it's very common. The best advice I can give you is to make sure he goes to the bathroom before he goes to bed and doesn't drink a lot of fluids or anything RIGHT before bed either, that should help.<br>  <br>  Other than that, don't worry about it too much :)|`|Zew5sfbyaa	my son is 4 and still bed wets at night only. I talked to my sons pedi about it and he said that a lot of boys wet the bed till like 10 and there isn't anything really that can be done but wait it out. He said when 11 hits if he is still doing it we could try meds but he thinks trying meds so early may hinder the normal progression. My son also is a heavy sleeper which is also why he wets the bed. We just buy goodnights and deal with it. I don't want him to feel like he is a failure since he obviously has no accidents during the day I truly think it is something he can't help.|`|6VR19YQWaa	There is nothing to worry about. Ask your doctor at the next checkup, but unless there is a medical reason, it can just be normal. My son wet the bed for years and he turned out fine!.<br>  I do suggest not to buy diapers. That kind of gives him the impression that you feel he's doing this on purpose. He can't control it yet and making him feel like a baby might make the problem worse.<br>  I suggest pull ups or good nights or even just a water proof pad under him that can be washed daily. Let him choose. At least he will feel in control of something.|`|mIuUQ4ehaa	Hi, well you can STOP  him all you need to do is don't let him have a drink before he goes to bed. E.G if you put him in bed at 8:00pm don't let him to drink from 6:00pm so basically don't let him drink 2 hours earlier.
wENdWT5kaa	Ok, first you shouldn't let her go more than 10 mins of constant crying, yelling etc. <br>  <br>  When i used it on my daughter when she was 14 months is i'd put her down, kissed her, gave her cuddles and told her goodnight and i loved her, closed the lights and walked out. Waited for 3 mins, went in, layed her back down, no talking and walked out, she'd start crying, waited 5 mins and went in and do the same thing. It lasted 30 mins for 3 nights. And it worked. <br>  <br>  Again, go in every few mins, not every 30 mins. That is to much crying and yelling for a little one. <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone put you down or make you feel bad. We all parent differently , and no one has the right to tell you otherwise. <br>  <br>  Do what you think is best for your children.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"She didn't need anything although, i think she just wanted me...my 7 year old telling me that he didn't get a good night's sleep because the baby was crying too much"<br>  <br>  'Hi, I have the maternal instinct of a toilet.'|`|EeGgovyCaa	For the sake of your other kid and yourself, you may want to try another method. <br>  <br>  Have you tried the white noise machine? it makes soothing sounds, even has the sound of a heartbeat from the womb. <br>  <br>  At 9 mnths there could be several reasons she's waking up. One being teething and it's painful. do you give her teething tablets before bed? She could be wet too. <br>  <br>  This is the exact reason I started co-sleeping. :)|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I have done "cry it out" with all of mine and I would highly recommend it because it is essential to the self soothing stage.  My first cried it out for about a half hour for 3 or 4 nights and that was it, he was good.  My second cried it out randomly but after a few weeks it stuck.  My third has done cry it out and sometimes it will last 5 minutes and sometime 2 hours, but it worked for him too.  Don't go in to roll them over or to soothe them or anything as it will reverse everything you have done.  They will think that if they cry it out long enough you will come in and rescue them and all the effort is undone.  Whereas if you let it play out it's course they will eventually go down and that will be that.  It's important now because when they transition to a toddler bed, if they haven't learned self soothing they'll refuse to go down and be getting up to play all the time as they will be free to do so in a non restrictive bed.|`|UghJ0XROaa	For parents who us it, you can't stop with it. It should take at the most 3 nights. After that, they don't cry themselves to sleep, they just go to sleep. There are some babies that need it, as harsh as that sounds, if you have a baby who is miserable from lack of sleep, getting your daughter a good nights sleep is needed. I would not just leave her in her room, put her in there, walk in every 5 min, just lay her down rub her back, but don't say a word, just keep repeating until she falls asleep. <br>  <br>  I know everyone is going to tell you it's horrible, but they are not raising your child!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	She seems to really need you, and she is still a baby. I would try and comfort her as best you can. I get that you feel bad for your older child, but I think I would also feel bad for the crying baby. She will learn to fall asleep on her own when she feels secure doing so. Leaving her to cry does not promote feelings of security. I did not use the cry-it-out method, but my son can fall asleep on his own sometimes with just my presence. You might try rocking her to sleep, or giving her a bottle at bedtime, or just being near her and maybe singing a song to her. There doesn't have to be and shouldn't be that much crying in order to sleep. Best of luck & take care!|`|KGRikkJeaa	maybe the room is too dark for her, that when she wakes up its scary...my 18mon old son does this...we set up his own room but he would wake up crying...finally m husband threw a mattress on the floor in the living room and slept with him, he hasnt woken up crying since. he still sleeps with him on the floor, they both like it and i dont mind|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I combined cry it out with the bedtime fade method when my daughter was 14 months old. The first night she went to bed at her normal time and it took her 2 hours to fall asleep (with me going in every 10 minutes to calm her down).  The next night I kept her up 2 hours later and it only took 20 minutes for her to fall asleep.  Once she was used to falling asleep on her own I started moving bedtime back up by 15 minutes a night until we were back to the normal bedtime.<br>  This method worked well for us and reduced the amount of time she spent crying.  I found the first night my daughter would get even more upset when I would go back to calm her down too, but the second night she was just too tired to fight it and gave in easier.  The first night she started sleeping through the night (before that she would wake back up every hour until I brought her to bed with me).  For the first week or so she would cry for 10-20 minutes to go to sleep but after that she realized that it was time to go to sleep and stopped crying at night.  Now when I put her to bed she grabs her blanket and giggles.  The first week or two may be hard but it does get better and soon enough you'll have a baby who happily goes to bed on her own.  <br>  Waiting until your son is on spring break to start is a good idea, maybe if you try putting music on for him while the baby is crying it will make it easier for him to tune her out.|`|3FcZSs3Waa	I feel for you. My son also fights sleep like crazy. Since he was about 2 months old, we have let him cry it out. <br>  <br>  This is our pattern. Make sure he is fed, changed and not in pain from teething (he is 7 months old now), lay him down in his crib with his binkie (this is the ONLY time he gets it), turn his mobile on and give him his Curious George doll (he really cuddles it, it's too cute), turn his monitor on, go in our room, turn our side of the monitor on but have the volume down. We let him cry for 15 min. Normally he is out by now. If he is not, we wait 5 more. <br>  <br>  I am luck because I let him cry it out, but it doesn't last that long. As long as you make sure she is not hurting, let her be. Maybe she needs a comfort item with her. Does she have a favorite blanket or stuffed animal? <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people think if you let your kid cry it out, your a bad parent. You have to make your own choices. As long as you and your husband think it is right, that is all that matters. <br>  <br>  I also feel for your son. I have a 7 year old step son, and when the baby cries, it makes him feel sad. During Spring Break is there anyone your son can stay the night with for a few nights? Maybe a sleepover with a friend or family member. That would make it easier for him too. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10469101	This drove my wife crazy.  If you know that they are safe and don't need anything, leave them alone.  Every time you check on them it will just excite them again.  You are teaching them that it will just take a little longer, so keep screaming.  I think my wife cried longer than they did the first few times.  I know that it's tough to hear them cry, but they need their sleep.<br>  The book "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"  by Marc Weissbluth <br>  was very helpful.  He is an advocate of bundling babies to mimic the feeling of being in the womb.|`|AXEqOEloaa	My son is 2 1/2 and he was a cry baby, at first I would not let him cry but my husband was like he is fed, clean, and tired let him cry. What I did was let him go at if for 10 minutes or so then go in the room and rub him and talk with him for a minute or so, I did not pick him up just let him know he was not alone. After about two weeks he was a lot better and he still had episodes once in a while but he finally figured it out.|`|cRjy9X7oaa	My baby is also 11 months old at the moment. We used to sit with her, sometimes for as long as 2 hours to get her off to sleep. It was horrible and me and my hubby both dreaded her bed time. We had been told about 'tough love' in the past but it always seemed cruel, until I spoke to a friend of mine, who put it in perspective. You teach your baby to eat, play, talk, walk, etc... so why shouldn't you teach your baby to sleep. She did a lot of motivating and made me feel like by us sitting with her, was doing her an injustice. She will cry when you leave her alone, but only cause its new... first time you gave your baby 'solids' I am sure she wasn't 100% keen on the idea... now loves it? Same as sleeping, she just needs to learn. As you've said she doesn't need anything, she is just crying. And the crying, I know, hurts the parents more than it hurts her. So as my friend said to me, just because your heart is breaking you give up teaching her how to go to sleep on her own... That's not fair is it? Also when they for 30 min and you go in, those 30min were a waste, a waste of your heart breaking, and most of all a waste of your baby getting all worked up. I know this sounds harsh, but it got me thinking straight, so hopefully it does the same for you. The first night we taught her to sleep on her own she cried for 40 min... then woke up like 30 min later and cried a lot more... It was like this for I would say the next 2 or 3 nights... She still has her bad nights where she moans (doesn't cry, and if she does, only for a couple mins) but the majority of the bad nights are our fault, cause we've had a busy day, or she's extremely tired. 99% of nights she goes to bed and lies in bed and 'talks' to her comfort blankie for about 10 minutes and then settles herself. No waking up in the night, and most mornings I have to wake her lol :P 'Tough Love' which I personally would change the name to 'Sweet sleep' is a dream come true for Abigail and me and my hubby. She now goes to bed at 7:45, and is usually asleep by 8pm and I go in at 8 am and both her and I are well refreshed and ready to play.  <br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|dDVAUA9saa	Before you decide to resort to CIO, make sure that YOU really think this is the right choice for you, your daughter and your family.  Not just what other people think or tell you.  Because people seem to think that by a certain age, babies should be sleeping through the night, when in fact, many children don't sleep through the night consistently until well over 3.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you try the controlled crying method instead?  This involves putting your child to bed as normal, but when they cry, leave them for a few minutes and then go in to their room.  Comfort her, explain that it's time to sleep, it's night time, etc. etc. then tell her you are leaving.  Leave the room, and wait about 10 minutes.  Then go back in and repeat.  Each time you go in, make the stay shorter and shorter, and make the times you are gone longer and longer.<br>  <br>  I am not saying I agree with this method, but it's better than leaving them cry for hours.  I have never let my daughter cry for more than 5-10 minutes and she's almost 2.  And 98% of the time, she sleeps through the night with no problems.<br>  <br>  I have read that letting your children cry themselves to sleep does not help in the long run.  If they get sick or you are away, you are back to square one.  <br>  <br>  Try the book "The No-Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Panton.

Assuming you are on your own, then unless you are unfit for work you will remain on JSA until you are 29 weeks pregnant and then you will be transferred onto Income Support. If you become unable to work before 29 weeks either with a pregnancy related condition or some other illness etc then you would be transferred onto ESA (Employment Support Allowance).|`|AA11537580	nothing til you become too big to work if you where working then you would have to be on maternity|`|BqqDJXkjaa	It depends on what country you're in (Im in Australia) but here I believe you would have to continue looking for a job for as long as you were in good health and then stop, go onto disability / pensioner for a few months if needed until the birth, then onto child care benefits. <br>  It's confusing, but others have been there before.

PcjOgAacaa	I have charted my BBT's (basal body temps) for about 2 years, off and on.  The BBT is your temperature (taken with a special BBT thermometer) taken first thing in the morning, before you get up or move around alot.   This tells you when you have ovulated; you will notice a temperature shift the day after you have ovulated.  Usually this is too late for you to have intercourse to try to have a baby.  But...it at least tells you that you ARE ovulating, and over a few months, you might be able to see a pattern (like you always ovulate on cycle day 14 or 15).<br>  <br>  I recently have started charting cervical mucus also.  This will tell you when you are starting to become fertile.  After your period, you will have no cervical fluid.  Then you start to have sticky fluid, then creamy, then more watery, and finally you will have stretchy "egg white" fluid.  That is when you are most fertile.  After you ovulate, you go back to creamy, maybe sticky, and then dry again until you get your period.<br>  <br>  I do not chart my cervical position, but yes, sometimes it is low, and sometimes high.<br>  <br>  Two sources of good info on all of this....fertilityfriend.com or Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.|`|fzjePK5Haa	Here's a great article that explains ovulation, charting your basal temperature, ect. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670536_track-ovulation-pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670536_track-ov...</a>|`|E6obQSpraa	try this site<br>  <br>  fertilityfriend.com<br>  <br>  it will help you understand things better.

But unfortunately I think they are likely to tell you no - you shouldn't be flying.  I think it has more to do with the liability of having somebody (at risk) in the plane.  Because if you go into labour whilst flying they are liable to turn the plane around for you and that can cost them money.  <br>  <br>  Good luck anyway.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	No it is not safe to fly on air planes this far along on pregnancy its not even that safe to travel long distances while you are this far along. check with your doctor but i am sure they will suggest that you re arrange your travel plans for after the baby arrives.|`|dY5fM2vTaa	i think that it is true sorry.

OI3bf4yjaa	If you have an average 28 day cycle (the start of your period is day 1 and day before your next period is day 28), you'll ovulate around day 14. The middle of your cycle is basically the fertile window. Try going to www.mymonthlycycles.com. It has an ovulation calculator. (It tells you when you are ovulating)...it helps a bunch.

The fertile week is 5-6 days before.<br>  <br>  Not everyone has a regular 28 day cycle, therefore you might not ovulate around day 14. It depends on the length of your cycle. <br>  I would ttc every other day during that week, as well as the day or two after you ovulate.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are unsure when you ovulate, you might want to use digital OPK sticks. They are very easy to use & help you to determine your LH surge prior to ovulate. It will give you a positive when it pin points your lutenizing hormone. I would ttc on this day, it will help maximize your chance in becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & have fun trying!|`|17LUQWaraa	I just talked to my doctor yesterday and she knows that my cycle is not quite 28 days. My husband and I have decided to try conceive. My doctor told me that about 14 days after the first sight of blood (because my period starts off very lightly) is the time of ovulation. She told me that my husband and I should have intercourse at least once a day 2days b4, the day of ovulation and the 2 days after. Hopefully this works, my man and I have been 2gether 7 yrs and we never got pregnant. Good luck to you.

But when you're living on your own, you can get assistance.<br>  I'm 20, with a 1 year old, and we have Food Stamps, and we used to have WIC(women, infants, and children).<br>  I know, you are going through something HUGE right now, and it's very easy to freak out. As well as very normal.<br>  <br>  There are many, many things that can be done. And because you are young, not finacially stable, and she is pregnant, most things will be provided for free. <br>  You'll need to check about what is provided in your area.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else, you or your girlfriend can feel free to contact me through e-mail.

Its an awesome feeling.|`|G9wEDvedaa	just be supportive of her and be involved in the babies life|`|wxbGmxbOaa	Well first off if you haven't told your parents yet that should be your next step. Your gf needs to set up an appointment with an OBGYN if she already hasn't. They will check her and baby out to make sure everything is going well. Next you need to get a job if you don't already have one. It would also be a good idea for her to get a job, depending on how far along she is, if she's farther into her pregnancy it may be hard for her to get a job. If it's still in the first trimester then she shouldn't have a problem getting a job as well. If you both have jobs, you will bring in more money and you won't have to worry about struggling for money when your little one gets here. Make sure to save up all that you can. If your gf doesn't have a insurance, she can check at DHHR and she can apply for a medical card. This will help pay for all the doctor visits. You don't want to go into this without any type of insurance of the bills will pile up on you and you'll be in debt. Also, you can check into food stamps at DHHR as well if you need that much help. She can also go to WIC and they will supply her with certain foods that are good for her and baby while she is pregnant. These foods are things like eggs, milk, juice, peanut butter/ dry beans, certain cereals. Also, if she wants to breast pump then they will teach her how to use the pump and they will also supply her with one, so she doesn't have to go out and buy one. If she decides breast feeding isn't for her, they will help you out with formula after the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats. It's nice to know you guys are taking responsiblity for your child. Also, if it makes you feel any better my bf and I are both 19 and even though my pregnancy was unplanned we're both doing fine with it. We already love our daughter and she isn't even here yet. Also, we're financially stable so that makes things a lot easier. Plus we both have supportive families (but whatever you do, you guys made the baby, so do not put your child off on your family.) Also, if you two were planning on going to college after high school, don't worry it is still possible. It is harder, but it's completely possible to still go.|`|RbnmvaXNaa	Make sure your really supportive of her and spend sometime with other peoples children. It wont get you fully prepared but it will help you get use to the ideal of having a child. Look up some fun things to do as a family when the baby comes. Buy some baby clothes. I know at 17 your life seems to be over but its not. Your child/teen life is over but your adult life is beginning. Think about this, you will have another human being who will look just like you and do some of the things you did when you were little. It will be fun to watch. Just start saving NOW also. <br>  P.S keep going to school. Many people will tell you, that you can't but you can. There are a lot of grants for parents who want to go back to school. Also look on your state and governments website for assistance.|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Life "ending" because of a baby is a total misconception.<br>  <br>  I have friends that had children around the same age and because they are mature enough and have level-heads, they've made the best of their situation. <br>  <br>  My fiance and I absolutely LOVE visiting our friends and their babies...everytime we visit the baby is doing something new and funny, learning new words, etc. <br>  <br>  My advice would be to calm down and take it a day at a time...do your child a favor and finish high school. Community college is a great resource-they often have their own day care centers at a discount price (or free!) for their students, school is cheaper (free w/ government aid, just meet with the financial aid department)...once you're in school you'll be able to find a better job and provide fun and exciting things for you and your family to do together!<br>  <br>  Remember how fun the arcade was when you were little?...Imagine being bigger and winning all the tickets for your little one! <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and I'm glad you're starting to look toward your future : )|`|azE51WGRaa	Ok, first you need to get a job. Talk to your g/f and have her apply for food stamps and medicaid (health insurance). She is guarenteed the medicaid because she's pregnant, just as long as she doesn't have other health coverage. She should get the food stamps too, which will help big time with buying food for her and the baby. Also have her apply for WIC (which she should get) because they will buy baby formula for the baby after it's born (she'll get milk and eggs and cheese and juice until then for herself). There are lots of resources out there to help you. Don't be afraid to use them. I'm 22, married, and still I need medicaid because my husbands job doesn't provide insurance (i also have WIC and foodstamps too. The application is a little long but shouldn't be too bad). For baby items, try thrift stores or secondhand stores. Most of these have really good baby items in good condition for little money. Good luck. Hope this helps.|`|usvsdELYaa	Be as supportive as possible. She is going to need your support during this difficult time in both of your lives. My second recommendation would be to assure her that EVEN if you and her someday break-up and stop loving each other (if you are at that stage in your relationship) that you will always love your son/daughter and keep to that promise. The biggest fear any unwed mother has is her baby not having a father or being left to "hold the bag" by herself.. Be a father always even if the relationship doesn't work.|`|PHzyDoKuaa	calm down your life is not over!<br>  i got pregnant at 17.<br>  i'm 20 now and me and my boyfriend are still together.<br>  my son is now 2 almost 3.<br>  <br>  unfortunately we both still live with our parents!<br>  but that's manly because the economy is so f-ed up!<br>  <br>  but your parents will help you, they will be ticked for a day or 2 but they will get over it and help you out.<br>  <br>  and you can still have friends and a life, but you will have responsibility.<br>  i suggest you tell your parents<br>  then get a job and save all your money for the baby.<br>  tell your girl to get to the doctor as soon as she can.<br>  <br>  just calm down, if your this upset just think how bad your girlfriend feels, she is the one who has to go threw everything!<br>  <br>  see if your girl can get the (ACCESS), it's public welfare so they pay for all the medical bills for your girl and baby.<br>  at least thats how it is in PA, i'm not sure where your from, but i'm sure your state has something like it.|`|NopTr18taa	I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant and I had my oldest at 19. You can go to the health department and sign up for WIC and Medicaid. (I'm assuming you most likely do not have a job with benifits to cover all of the prenatal and delivery of the child) Be supportive and be in the child's life. Don't do what my oldest son's father did and split. Good Luck, you'll need it|`|3HsRIo1kaa	I am pregnant right now at the age of 14. I know if my b.f. was kind enough to help me, the thing I would like the most would be: him being there to support me. I would love it if he made sure I was doing OK.

7HZAzS01aa	I am very sorry you are going through this. What your Doctor said doesn't sound right to me. Your body may takes weeks to return to normal. What kind of pregnancy tests did they do to determine your pregnancy and the miscarriage? Was it urine or blood? Blood would be most accurate, and if they did 3 and watched your HCG levels drop to zero, then they have enough info to determine that you did miscarry. However, it sounds to me like you had some bleeding around the time you would've first found out you were pregnany. That bleeding may or may not have been normal. It is possible to bleed and still have a healthy baby. If something is wrong, you could bleed a bit and then have it stopped - That happened to me with my first miscarriage. It was a missed miscarriage. I had bleeding to indicate something was wrong, but it was not enough to fully miscarry... I was told it could take weeks for your body to finish the process. I took medication to help things along. And contrary to that, I bled for 2 weeks in the first trimester with my daughter and she was born healthy and full term.<br>  <br>  It is too early for an u/s. They usually don't book them before 6 weeks because the fetal pole might not show up on the u/s, or if it does, it might not show a heartbeat - which doesn't mean there is no heartbeat, just that it's too early to determine.<br>  <br>  The "constipation" pain could be miscarriage pains from your uterus cramping. I don't know why your doctor would say constipation when you are possibly going through a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I would recommend, if you haven't already, get a quantitative blood test to determine if there is any HCG in your body at all. This will give you some answers. Don't wait, do it now to ease your mind. If your numbers are up, book a second test in 2 days to compare the levels. If it's zero, then at least you know for sure and can look at your options (such as D&C)<br>  <br>  If you have any extreme pain, or you are bleeding heavily, please see a doctor ASAP.<br>  <br>  If everything seems to sit at a standstill, then all you can do is wait a week or 2 and go back and demand an ultrasound. It won't be too early then, and you will get some closure.|`|bTXsr5JWaa	i would go back and pester them. you may have some tissue left over. they have a responsibility to ensure that you are ok.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry for your loss x|`|usvsdELYaa	I would go to a doctor again and get a second opinion. I also had a miscarriage but unlike you I bled for days on end. It was very scary for me. I went to the doctor all of my pregnancy tests came out negative and they also had to go in to remove the rest of the fetus that was left ....I'd recommend going to see another doctor.|`|kbrW9hSRaa	yes u should go back to the hospital but go somewhere else and get another doctor to see whats going on because u know whats going on with your body and u take care of yourself and take it easy i'm so sorry for your loss.
4Bgw5xs8aa	Good stores to go to or their websites are Dillards, Macy's, and Babies R Us. They have some super cute ones for both boys and girls.
5N3odm3Qaa	If there are no clots or chunks and it's just light blood, it's almost definitely implantation bleeding. Since your period was only two weeks ago and you are not on the pill, it sounds like you're pregnant.|`|nISYAHkfaa	The only way you can know is to take a pregnancy test up to five days before a missed period, preferably a little later. It can be normal to spot a little between periods, but considering that you are not on birth control, you definitely have the possibility of becoming pregnant if you're sexually active.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but none of us can answer the question for you with any kind of certainty. =(|`|Sb21xEQfaa	could u be pregnant???
SfwLF8j2aa	I LOVE them!! I love the name Riley for a boy and I love the spelling Ryleigh for a girl,just makes it so much more feminine! Good Luck:)|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I think it's cute. Ryleigh/Riley isn't too close to Raeghan, and they sound good together.<br>  Congrats!|`|lYjweuZmaa	YES I LOVE IT|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Adorable. <br>  I normally like Riley for a girl, but it works perfectly with Raeghan.|`|DutTBV3caa	i think riley and ryleigh as adorable! there similar to raeghan but not too close you know? very very cute! love them!|`|lqLzULXEaa	Sorry i dont like those names ...... they sound too manly why dont you pick names that are a little more girly<br>  <br>  <br>  ?????|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Raeghan and Riley/Ryleigh sound great as siblings! That's super cute!
7clS7baaaa	how many children do you have already? ya know, in the end its totally up to you what you name your children.  there are always gonna be people who do like the names and people who dont like them.  i like names that sound pretty and are spelled a little differently.  just sit down with a pen and paper and make a list.  take a list with you to the hospital with an open mind and as soon as you see your baby you will know exactly which name fits her.....good luck and god bless ...btw I have a daughter whose name is Kaurlee Ann!!! great name!|`|lYjweuZmaa	MY NAME IS CARRIE AND I LOVE MY NAME!!!<br>  <br>  TEEHEE<br>   AND YES I LIKE CARLY ANNE RATHER THATN CARLEY ANN BUT YES I LIKE IT.|`|wdXQaATDaa	I think they are adorable!!<br>  My name is Kaylee! lol|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Sounds like you like "matching" names...If this is the case then they go very well together. You may also want to consider spelling Carley "Carlee" to match her sister's name even more :)|`|Ne58NIDGaa	I like all of your names separate. But, think about if you are calling all their names at once...would it be too much of a tongue twister? Or on a Christmas card all the names would be similar|`|DWLfKACYaa	i like it|`|vP1YhRaWaa	I have two boys John and Joe and I am always mixing their names . If I had to do it again I would not go with name that start with the same sound. Frustrating sometimes.|`|5587e6858af0815b60a2d4300d0ae64aaa	They sound good together. <br>  <br>  Why not Karlee or Carlee?
RwoN3E9Uaa	Just about all newborns are gassy/fussy/show signs of acid reflux.  There was probably no reason for you to quit breastfeeding and go on some special formula.  By the time your baby starts growing out of the gassy/fussy/acid reflux (about 1-1.5 months old) you will contribute it to the formula, not just the maturing of her GI tract.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question:  soon your baby will grow out of those symptoms.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I had the EXACT same situation. The alimentum worked in about a week, but he still spit up everyday. If they have reflux there is really no way around that, but the alimentum will help some. I quit the alimentum at 4 months and he did well when we put him back on the regular. Can you believe the price of that alimentum!?|`|Eh6MnODtaa	My son had/has acid reflux issues, he was put on Alimentum around 6-7 months and he didn`t like the taste (and the smell, oh my) first but got use to it in a few days. We did see some improvement using this special formula, I think it was very gentle on his belly. Before that he was breastfed for 4 months and we were using the Similac Soy formula which the doctor thought he might be allergic too. So we were switched to Alimentum and got Prevacid as well. After using it for about 5 weeks, we switched our son back to Similac Sensitive and he is doing fine. I have one advice for you: if you end up using Prevacid (your baby might be a little young for it though I don`t know for sure), get the Solutabs, they work a thousand times better!!!! The liquid `version` looses its strengh after a week or so and you have to deal with a baby who is in pain or uncomfortable, fussy again. Good luck figuring out what is the best for your little one and keep up the good work!|`|pev8C9eaaa	my son was on alimentum 4 wks after he was born. it took a good week before his little system got use to it.  i still had some problems with him going to the bathroom so my doctor told me to give a 1/4 tsp of maalox in the morning and @ night until he got used to it so i did and it worked and then i would just give him it every other day and he stayed pretty reg.  then i switched his formula to enfamil ar because he was spitting up soooo much on the alimentum and he seems to be doing much better.  good luck and hopefully she doesnt have to stay on it that long! btw it stinks like cheez-its and use liquid much easier for them
Fh4B88ZGaa	It's normal to be concerned- and you will continue to be concerned until the end of your pregnancy, and then you'll be worried about the baby. You're taking on a huge responsibility, so what you are feeling is totally normal- just remember that worrying doesn't change the outcome. Take good care of yourself, follow your doctors instructions, and try not to think of the bad things that could happen- focus on the joy the baby will bring.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U R normal -- all moms go thru this because we want to have a healthy baby. The best thing U can do for this unborn child is to RELAX. Eat well and have FUN being pregnant. Read a lot of positive information. DO NOT let people scare U. For some unknown reason some humans delight in telling moms-to-be horror stories of birth deliveries that went all wrong. DO NOT listen to them, as it will only make U more unsettled. Just listen to the good tales, and stay in the company of nurturing women. We love U.|`|96e831baa272f7f9b2a90151f63bf4b4aa	If you had an ectopic pregnancy you would be in a load of pain in your abdomen.  Even then, it could just be something else.  I wouldn't worry about that.  I would expect that if you miscarried, you would have bled.  That's not always the case, but most of the time, that's what happens.  Try to tell yourself that worrying will not do anything except stress you out.  The chance that something is wrong is slim though.  Most of the time things turn out just fine.  I know how you feel but once you actually start to feel the baby your fears will subside more.|`|oMGasIcjaa	I can assure you that this is completely normal to worry like this.  Then, once the baby is born you will be concerned you are a good parent.  It just comes with the territory! :)  Just try to relax and enjoy this part of your pregnancy while you are physically comfortable! :) Congrats BTW!|`|O5KOwhovaa	Most pregnancies play out without any hitches.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine. The statistics are on your side.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	You need to think positive thoughts. All that stress isn't good for you or the baby.|`|Lv0wvXSzaa	take good care of your self and read up on everything. when you feel more educated and are making the right choices you feel at ease. especially if you have a good support system around you. husband friends mom, family ect.|`|YsGodD80aa	yeah I remember that time. Well if ur taking ur prenatals n eating healthy your child is most likely fine. Just realize this babe STRESS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL,N WORRYING ISNT EITHER.

3071d1a5e292f35a62b16dfcc0e36de5aa	i would definitally get yourself tested... if your symptoms continue or escalate there is probably a good chance that you may be pregnant... its much better to know early on so getting tested would probably be the best solution right now
5N3odm3Qaa	If it has been a week since your period, you should go to the pharmacy or Planned Parenthood and get Plan B ASAP. Not everyone ovulates at the same time and some men's pre-ejaculate fluid can contain sperm. Not all men have sperm in there but many do. Don't risk anything. Get Plan B ASAP and get started on that. Your chances of being pregnant are slim but definitely not worth the gamble.|`|YVE64dJUaa	Not trying to lecture you but here goes<br>  <br>  Having unprotected sex is very irresponsible, take the morning after pill as a precaution as although he may have pulled before ejaculation there is still pre ejaculate which is not always felt by the male during sex this can contain sperm and as it only takes one to impregnate you is it worth the risk? then go get yourself checked for STI's just to be on the safe side as STI's like gonorrhea and chlamydia can carry no symptoms for you or your partner and so he may have an STI and not know about it and then potentially have passed it on to you, same goes for your boyfriend as you may have an STI not be aware of it and passed it on to him <br>  <br>  If you decide not to get yourself checked for STI's and don't take the morning after pill you are responsible for the consequences of potentially bringing a child in to the world and also potentially harboring a STI and not telling your current partner or future partners which is VERY irresponsible<br>  <br>  SO<br>  <br>  Go to your pharmacy and ask for the morning after pill, book an appointment with your GP for a full STI check and tell your boyfriend to check himself out as well at least this way you both have peace of mind<br>  <br>  In the future unless you are in a stable relationship and are planning a family ALWAYS use a condom|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	The "pull out" isn't a method of birth control. Even before he ejaculates pre-ejaculate comes out, which can still get you pregnant. See if you can still take Plan B. If you don't have a condom, control yourself and go buy one, or don't do it. If you keep going this way you will probably get pregnant.|`|RvbPHhI8aa	Chances are you'll be fine without it. You aren't at an ovulation peak in your cycle, and if he pulled out (though I don't recommend this as a form of birth control), then your chances of conception are lowered. That having been said... if you are going to lose sleep over it, get the pill. And do it quick. The pill only works 72 hours after intercourse and decreases in effectiveness as time wears on.<br>  <br>  But I would say if Plan B is something you are against, you'll be safe.<br>  <br>  Go on the pill/patch. It makes sex a little less worrisome.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	plan b.  better to be safe than sorry.  you can even get prenant when he pulls out.  best to get on the pill as well.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you should. <br>  The pull out method doesn't work.<br>  <br>  and you should also get tested for STD's unless you have some sort of proof your bf is clean.|`|HhaadKixaa	It depend on if you were ovulating. You can determined this by how many days are in your cycle. For example, if you have a 21 day cycle ( from the beginning of one period to the beginning of another) and you bleed for 7 days, then yes, you could ovulate right after your period. This is because we know ovulation can occur 12-16 days before your next period begins, and this would put you ovulating at days 6-10 of your cycle. <br>  <br>  <br>  But the morning after pill is basically a strong form of birth control. Its a quick trip to the Dr. today and they'll right you a Rx. Some places I believe our now over the counter.  "Better safe than sorry".;)...Good Luck!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I know most people will say "yes take the morning after pill" but really you should pay for the consequences of being so bloody irresponsible for not using protection!!  Babies, are not flies on the wall you can kill at will.|`|Vf4w8dNNaa	I'm living proof the pull out method does not work. <br>  11 weeks and 5 days pregnant.<br>  Sorry hun, gotta get on some birthcontrol.  Plan B is a good idea for your situation right now.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	You can still very easily get pregnant that way.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	If you don't want a baby take the pill then protect yourself.|`|IeLBIACaaa	you should be fine
Xn2BCV8Kaa	plan b if its been less than 72hours. other than that... theres no real way of knowing until your period is late.. and then testing.<br>  <br>  precum may have leaked into you when the condom broke and yes that can lead to pregnancy. <br>  <br>  you need to go on the birth control pill or another hormone contraceptive to ensure that this doesnt happen again in the future. <br>  <br>  play safe. :)|`|TV1Fvhfxaa	If he didn't ejaculate in you then no.|`|NNPYEZVTaa	how old r u

MRV9rNyjaa	since you both use protection its very unlikey. and as you grow and mature, your body changes. this could be one of those changes your body is going through.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you both wear protection it's highly unlikely. More than likely you are reading into things that have always been there before your period because you are worried about becoming pregnant. Sore breasts and or nipples can be a sign of PMS.|`|fvuEtkROaa	With two forms of birth control,   pregnancy is unlikely.  Breast tenderness can also precede your period. Relax.|`|4QCF6xYHaa	The chances of you being you being are very slim if your on the pill and he is using condoms.<br>  However if a condom has broken while you have been having sex and if you have been sick (with either vomitting or dirreoah) it is a possibility.<br>  I got pregnent when I had food poisioning because it didnt occur to me that throwing up for one day would make the pill inactive because i had heard it takes years for your body to go back to normal and be able to concieve.<br>  But if both of these things didnt happen then the chances are that your just having PMS symptoms, if your really stressed about it you can take a pregnency test if your period is late but not before the date your period is due because if you take it to early it wont show accurate results if you are pregnent because the hormone levels wont have changed enough.<br>  Hope that was helpfull|`|Um3qrVrqaa	Your symptoms are also a sign that your period is coming. Its pretty much impossible for you to get pregnant if you have double the protection.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	You aren't pregnant. You have double protection, which is much more than most people. :)|`|59ruxdtJaa	thats also a sign of ur period coming. i used to get it every week before i started my period. if your on birth control and hes wearing a condom, you have absolutely nothing to worry about....|`|ujDIo1Xaaa	it's okay. ur just going to get you're period. <br>  if ur on pills and he has a condom and you do to you're fine.|`|CO1t3KJzaa	ok you NEVER noticed it before cause it didnt matter...

01Mu3wUeaa	Knowing that bars are notorious for bar fights with sloppy drunks? no way!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i don't think many bars allow children especially ones in a stroller. but i would think any woman who would take her baby into a bar is a moron! i mean seriously.... first of all if i was at a bar to have fun i would be seriously complaining to the manager if i saw a baby there and second of all bars are filled with all kinds of people ... most of whom end up drunk and the chances that something can happen to a baby with a drunk person around is just too high. not to mention having a glass of wine or a beer is one thing but if you are drinking anymore then that NO ONE should be taking care of a kid or putting a kid in a car and driving them around. the whole situation is just dumb and anyone who would do it is someone i would consider an irresponsible parent. don't have kids if you don't want your life to change|`|xubIaiZaaa	i wouldnt take my baby to a bar no way, if i wanted to take my baby out with friends i would go to a resteraunt for lunch/dinner or something like that|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Why would you want your baby with you at a bar. save the bars for kid free times.|`|PJBjllsVaa	i think it is completely unacceptable to have ANY child under the age of 21 in a bar ESPECIALLY a baby in a stroller. i find it hard to believe a bar (even in a restaurant) would allow a woman to have a baby at the bar. when you make the choice to have kids (or have sex and get pregnant) you HAVE to change your life because your life changes. period.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Moms can go meet up in a restaurant in a booth with their kids and have a drink. That seems more appropriate. I can't imagine an actual bar would allow children in.<br>  <br>  Baby sitters exist for a reason. Its pretty easy to find one so you can leave the kids home and go out for a few hours.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I wouldn't bring our baby to a bar - she would hate it anyway. If I want to have a drink with my friends, we'll have a glass of wine at a cafe during the day and it wouldn't be a big deal if anyone brought their baby in a stroller. But not to a bar. It's noisy and crowded and it would probably be past her bedtime.
k3V2CA81aa	My RE charges $2500 and that includes all meds, U/S, the IUI itself, and blood work.
jbz3NeSiaa	could be.. take a test.. that'll give ya a definate answer|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Take a pregnancy test? Maybe you have just been stressed and that's why you had a short period.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Pretty much what everybody's saying, take a test.<br>  <br>  If you're having sex, the possibility for pregnancy is always there and is never 100% ruled out, even if you use multiple types of birth control.<br>  <br>  Don't worry though, tests cost about $10 max, and if you're having trouble getting one sometimes you can go to a health center and get one for free, or your insurance may cover it. Takes about five minutes and will set your mind at ease either way.|`|4QCF6xYHaa	It is possible but unlikely, if you have been sick recently that can effect the pills ability to work (I have a daughter who is living proof) but if you have been regular with taking the pill on time and haven't been sick or taking any other medication that can interfere with the pill then I doubt you are.<br>  But the only way to get piece of mind is to take a test :) they are available everywhere (supermarkets, Chemists etc) and you dont need to buy the expensive ones the cheap ones work just as well but you wont feel better about it unless you no for sure and thats best way to find out for certain.<br>  Since you have already had a partial period you can take a test now and it will have accurate results, other things can lead to varying periods like stress. I would go to my doctor and see if he had anything to say about it just incase there could be an underlying problem.|`|EZdHWa4taa	It's a possibility, but birth control doesn't always work that safely. <br>  Take a test~|`|pqzKlNudaa	Maybe take a test at home.|`|XrH3y9Agaa	First of all, calm yourself down. The more you worry about it, your hormone might go unstable (sorry if I didn't manage to put it in a good English structure) and that might affect your period. <br>  <br>  Tired, stress can vary your period's duration. <br>  <br>  Are you afraid of getting a pregnancy test cause of privacy issue? If so, I guess you can just go ahead, just tell your situation and they won't insist to do something that you don't like. <br>  <br>  It's better to check it as soon as possible instead of worrying by your own. You can contact related department for advise before you go. You will be less pressure to ask through the phone I suppose.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped. Best of luck.

Although amphetamine can be ok for infants, the amount is what matters. You wouldn't want to risk your infants well-being. Good Luck
9P26sacKaa	You can eat any sushi that is cooked or otherwise has no raw meat.  So vegetable-based sushi are okay, california rolls are okay, etc.  The only worry with california rolls is that they have the crab meat in them, which is usually not cooked just prior to eating.  So eating them has the same risk of food poisoning as eating deli meat that isn't cooked right before eating it. Now, not many people eat deli meat that they've cooked or heated just before eating, so it's a risk you probably already take all the time.  Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  I'd personally eat california rolls, but there is risk associated with eating meat that was cooked long before eating.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	I am 6 weeks pregnant and I used to have sushi 3-4 times a week and I'm dying without it. Ask your doc but there's a risk of cross contamination. Japanese women eat sushi....wish there was some concrete evidence that its unsafe.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Anything cooked it okay. California rolls have cooked crab in them. They are fine. I just ate some today in fact and I'm 5 mo preg. You want to avoid the raw fish sushi.|`|xxkL46Yaaa	I don't think california rolls would be considered sushi.  All of it is cooked.  Check with your dr just in case though|`|IFDfpbFJaa	California Roll doesn't have any raw fish in it....It's the raw fish you want to stay away from. I eat California roll and dragon roll while I'm pregnant.
8WbfmK5daa	Yeah sure Bugaboo's are reliable however, I think you can get better ones for the money. <br>  <br>  Bugaboo's are hard to push over rough or uneven ground and they are not all that compact when folded up to get in and out of the boot of the car etc. Depending on the model they can be quite large as well. There is also a nak to putting them up or down but you will get used to it quick enough if you decide to get one.<br>  <br>  Other disadvantages you might find are there are fewer cup/bottle holders and less storage. Also it is expensive and you have to buy a lot of extras usually to go with it. Some models can be bulky and heavy and are difficult to assemble and disassemble.<br>  <br>  However, there are loads of advantages as well including it being Attractive, Easy to maneuver, Can be positioned facing or away from you, Takes curbs easily, amazing suspension, totally versatile, Very Flexible and trendy.<br>  <br>  Personally I much prefer the Icandy apple it is so much more adaptable with a carry cot, rear facing and forward facing seat unit, can clip a maxi cosi carseat into it. Can change it from 3 wheels to 4 wheel jogger mode and you save hundreds on the bugaboo. The icandy just suits my needs so much more than the bugaboo ever did.|`|bTqnkyIAaa	I have one, and we love it!  Although, now that we have two kids, it is hardly ever used.  We mostly use our double BOB now.  We have the bugaboo wheeled board which is nice for 2 kids.
um29wkUPaa	I was gonna, but I thought I'd turn'em on to tartism instead.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Heck yes he'll get a job! I'm not going to hand my child everything in life. This way he will understand the importance of the dollar. I'll match him for a car, and I will pay for his college, but other than that, he can buy his own stuff. <br>  <br>  <br>   My 1st job was at 16 and I worked at McDonalds, lol. That is still my favorite job. It wasn't so much the job itself, but the people I worked with. Why can't all jobs be as fun as your 1st? *sigh*|`|P544Sbmqaa	I think its ok if a teenager wants to work, but I will not force my children to work unless their is a legit financial need for them to do so for the sake of family survival.<br>  <br>  However, once they are out of school, if they are going to be living with me, they need to be doing something, be it more education or volunteering or working.  I will not support an adult sitting on their butt all day.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It really depends.<br>  <br>  I have anxiety so it wasn't easy to just go out and get a job at any ordinary place.Luckily, I was able to get a job at my friend's business.<br>  <br>  If my kid has the same issue, I will not force him/her to get jobs but they will have to pull their weight around the house and go to school.|`|2ucsbBGjaa	Yep my son is going to get a job as soon as he's old enough.  Nothing was "given" to me and I don't want him to be spoiled either.  My first job was a waitress at IHOP.  It really sucked but taught me how to work really hard.  I'll get my son a car so long as he's good, not a juvenile delinquent... and then he will have to pay for his own gas out of his own pocket.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I will not "make" them, but my now 11 year old daughter is already anxious to get her first job.  She wants to work at the local Piggly Wiggly as soon as she is old enough.  That is a grocery store, we frequent it often and know everyone well and her uncle is a manager there.  <br>  <br>  She has quite a life plan-she knows that she wants to dual enroll in the local community college during her junior and senior years of high school, graduationg homeschool having already accrued some college credits.  That should allow her to enter college as a Sophomore, perhaps even a junior, where she wants to major in Pre Vet before going to Veterinary School.<br>  <br>  We have taught both of our older children good work ethic and the value of a dollor, so I do believe they will both want to work when they can.  They already do odd jobs here and there to earn money.  We will teach the baby, and any future children, the same.|`|f97b8fda569e8e29554fa9c50704fecbaa	i wouldn't make them but i would certainly suggest it especially if they are asking me for things i simply cant afford. i went out and got a job on my own the second i was old enough and im so glad i did having a job through high school put my foot in the door for when i left and went to find a full time job. it was only three days a week so i had plenty of time for homework and school activities such as dancing and being involved in plays. you have no idea how many hours are in the day until you see you child going to school working and doing outside activities and you know what they love every second of it. so in short dont make them but if they want to then support them all the way.|`|prqrQcd1aa	The first job outside of babysitting I had was when I was 14 years old. I don't think i'll encourage a job that young, but I do see myself encouraging them to get a job around the age of 15 or 16 so that they can learn about how to save money and get the bigger items that they would like to have, with me helping if they wish me to. <br>  This is one good thing I can say about my mom, she did tell me that if I wanted to have nice clothes that she couldn't' afford, that i could get them myself. I bought my own vcr, my own bike, my own basically everything. I won't do exactly that with my kids, but i will teach them the value of money, actually already kind of do with my 7 year old.|`|trXjBRlRaa	When my boys are old enough absolutely they will work but with strict guidelines.<br>  <br>  Holiday employment and summer employment is great! Keeps them busy, helps them earn spending money, and teaches them responsibilty. As well, this is good on their resume as they get older.<br>  <br>  During the school year their job is their education.|`|eya1WDS4aa	my first actual real job besides baby sitting was when i was 16, i worked at a sonic as a car hop. And yes my kids will have jobs if they want to go do stuff. they will pay for their own gas in their cars and what not, im not a bank and once they are to that age they should be working, i think it teaches respsiblity and how to handle money.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I'm 14, I work at an Italian gelato cafe called "Gelatissimo" on Thursdays and Sunday afternoons.<br>  And I babysit for my cousin.|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	Hello! here are your questions you asked<br>  <br>  i believe having a job is a great thing for a teenage. it keeps them busy. they learn what money really is and how hard us parents work to get it.. they use that money to buy items they want. so it shows them great dedication to get what they want,<br>  <br>  my first job was probably my favorite job was when i work at the Fair Grounds.. i worked in the FFA or 4H  area. i worked with baby lambs,sheep, piglets and a huge yorkshire pig. i worked with a cow and her 3 week old calf..<br>  <br>  just being around the animals it was so much fun. i also babysat many kids.. thus the reason why i love children and why i love reading about pregnancy and love doing yahoo answers..<br>  <br>  i learn responsibility, i became mature, and getting that first job it helped me get my first real job as a courtsey clerk which i learn to be more mature and become more of a adult.. <br>  <br>  i soon learn to help buy my school clothes and i soon learn it wasn't half bad having money because i saved 2,000 to help buy half my my truck and i paid for gas. i soon paid my own phone bill which taught me even more responsibility because i learned to keep my money and i learned to pay bills getting me ready for adults.<br>  <br>  so it helps the child out but it also helps YOU out.. and many places like fast food or grocery stores help kids and give them flexible schedules so they can still participate in school.<br>  <br>  i believe it shapes a teen into a adult by getting there first job.. but just make sure you don't force them into a job they don't like.. help them get a job they do like like if they like cars get a job at autozone, of if they like shopping have them get a job at target or macys so they can go shopping later.. you know and get the idea.. <br>  <br>  i hope i helped you out! good luck on choosing.<br>  <br>  i've also turned out really well. i graduated high school with a 3.8 gpa. i also when i moved away for school i felt like i could take care of myself.. i now pay rent,comcast,phone bill pg&e.  and groceries all by myself and my partner..  so i turned out grea and i loved working as well..|`|AA12145826	Ah, there's Johnny's Mommy's troll.......<br>  <br>  Yep, if Hannah wants a car, spending money, clothes I don't approve of, etc. she's going to have to get a job (presuming she keeps her grades up of course....that's the first requirement).<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Oh and my first job, outside of babysitting of course, was as a housekeeper for a Best Western near my house. The next summer I upgraded to a Hilton nearby. Those jobs were great because my hours were all compatible with my skating schedule at the time. However I couldn't work during the school year because of all my extra-curricular activities (soccer, drama, choir, foreign language club, etc. plus my skating schedule)|`|eISzHe5maa	My mom's not making me get a job at the moment.I turned sixteen and I do want one but I can't get one until I get my license in the summer because my mom wants me to drive my own but to work (the shopping mall/center is like fifteen - twenty minutes away from my house). It sucks because I've had a couple people asking if I wanted a job at certain stores I frequent all the time, lol. <br>  <br>  But nope, my mother's not making me get a job. She thinks it's nice that I want one, but she wasn't surprised - she knows how much of a workaholic I am. <br>  <br>  Both our priorities at the time are school. I'm busting my butt at keeping that 3.8 G.P.A., trying to do some extra curriculars, and doing the best I can on those damn standardized tests. Me doing well in school are more important than any job at the moment. <br>  <br>  She will let me get one, but like I said have to get the license first and hopefully I'll be good. I also have to keep up my G.P.A.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I'm not sure if I would "make them" but I would definitely strongly encourage it!<br>  My 15yo was working at Pottery Barn last year (Thanks for the discount baby!) but she quit after christmas because she was too busy with dance and school. Now she works at the stable where we board her horse which pays less but it's great because its so casual she can basically choose all her hours to suit her schedule.<br>  She loves it, and it has helped her gain a better understanding of the value of money and spending-she puts some of her ownmoney and allowance into a account she's using to contribute to college tuition, some of her allowance and own money goes into a different savings account, and the rest she usually spends ;) I'm so glad she is mature and responsible enough to do that, and I hope that when my boys (they are all under 6) are older they will choose to do the same.<br>  <br>  I started babysitting when I was about 12, and then I worked at my dance school, teaching the younger kids. When I was about 16 my dad made me work in my uncles restaurant and I HATED it, and he let me quit after 8 weeks because I honestly couldn't handle it. I got married and moved away at 17 and fell pregnant only a few monthes later, so I just concentrated on finishing school and being a mom, then started work as a teacher. But because we moved so much due to my husbands job (every 6-12months) it was hard to find work, so most of the time I was doing subsitute teaching or volunteering teaching English in some countries. I've been teaching in the same place now for almost 4years and love it! It's also the longest time i've been able to keep a job for this long (it's the first time we've lived in the same place for more than a year!).<br>  <br>  Good question :)|`|nfzQkvqraa	I didn't read the other answers so I may be repeating, but here goes.<br>  <br>  I was also 15 when I got my first job.  I worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken all through high school.  I worked as many hours as I possibly could given my age at the time.  I remember distinctly working on my 16th birthday.  The bonds that I made and the lessons that I learned were VERY valuable to me.  I too learned fast the value of a dollar.  I think it's very important.<br>  <br>  I will not MAKE my children get a job, but I think I will strongly encourage it.  Even if it's only summers or weekends for a few hrs. a week.  When they want a car we will contribute, but I've already decided that they either have to match us the money. (for ex. my husband and I contribute 2,000 then they contribute 2,000) and/or they are responsible to pay their monthly insurance.  College will be paid for aside from books, but I'm not buying my kids a car flat out.  Learning to struggle for what you want is very rewarding in the end.  I wouldn't be where I was today if I didn't have to do that.  <br>  <br>  By the way, it's sort of funny but I just got my social security letter in the mail and I've earned more money each year I worked as a teenager than I have since I've had children.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Everything you said I was going to say!  I also had to get a job. Other than babysitting my first job was at sonic. During the summer I worked at sonic and a pizza place and I was a cheerleader! I worked very hard to also help out my mom- she never asked I just wanted to- she was working two jobs to support my brother, sister and myself all alone.  I paid for my first car myself ( a 1986 buick park avenue) and I loved that piece of crap, lol! To this day I never take anything for granted so yes my children will work.  I want them to learn what I learned.  My brother and sister both didn't work bc once they got old enough my mom was a lot more finacially secure and they didn't need to and to this day both of them are extremly irresponsible.  They don't appreciate anything so from my point of view it was a huge difference!|`|im3vWyv6aa	I don't think I'll have to make my children get a job. It's in our blood. My oldest daughter is already thinking she gets to work in the cornfield this Summer. She will be 13 in May... she heard you can work in the cornfield when you're 13.<br>  <br>  About me... I babysat a lot. I worked in the cornfields (that's where I met my high school boyfriend). I worked at JcPenney - that was a great job. I also worked at Scoops (an ice cream shop.) Great memories!<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I won't make them get a job when they're still in school.  I'll let them, though, if they want them.  Once they're adults, I'll expect them to get a job & start being responsible for themselves in the world. <br>  <br>  Our teen keeps talking about looking for a job, but extracurriculars keep getting in the way & that's fine.  She'll find one this summer, I think.  She really wants to, anyway. <br>  <br>  My first job, besides babysitting (which I started doing as a team with my younger sister when I was 12 & she was 10) and a paper route (again, did it as a team w/younger sister - starting when I was 10 or so) - was when I was 15, at the public library.  Next one was at Dairy Queen, the summer between junior & senior year.  I ended up working there 7 summers, coming back from college & as a second job once I was on my own.  Those college summers were sweet - major outdoor concert venue about 30 min away & flexible employer.  Fun job with kids that I liked.  Season passes to amusement park that was about an hour away.  Just had to pay car payment & insurance (my parents didn't charge rent or anything like that).  Ahhhh!|`|oP504BtFaa	My daughters are fourteen and they babysit, and I suppose when they are sixteen (age to work) I will encourage them to get 'real' jobs if they want to. However, at 10 dollars an hour, babysitting is making them more money than most jobs and it doesn't interfere terribly with school, friends and activities.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Absolutely. She'll be working at 16 just like I was. When I was 16 I wanted a car, and I got one. But then it needed gas and insurance and apparently, it was supposed to be provided for by me.<br>  <br>  I bagged groceries at a Bristol Farms. I worked 2-3 days a week averaging 10 hours, I came away with about $45/week and I so loved getting that money.|`|j2mRop0laa	I hope they get something part time for gas money. ha ha<br>  <br>  I am also going to encourage them to get a job at the place they shop. That way they get a discount. We have 2 malls within a 10-15 minute drive. They can get a job there.<br>  <br>  As long as it doesn't affect their grades- yes I want them to.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I will have her get one at 16, unless you can't at 16. Because the way things are going she might not be able to get one at 16. <br>  My first job was at 16 and I was a CNA.
l9lrT7bfaa	He wants to be there while you are pregnant for his benefit - he doesn't want to cop any more flak than necessary from family, friends etc.<br>  <br>  Do not give the baby his last name - what for? That will tie you with him forever. I regret naming my children with my husbands surname and the day he left I used my name for them. They have to wait until they are 18 to change their name as he refuses to give permission even though he has had nothing to do with them for all their lives (including financial support).<br>  <br>  You need to only consider your own wishes - end of story.|`|WZQKevt8aa	I think you would be better off leaving him before the baby comes, as it is more stressful AFTER you have a baby than when you are pregnant, and you don't want to be dealing with a break up at the same time. Also, if you leave him now, you can get used to doing a majority of things yourself before the baby is born, which can be practice for when the baby is born and you don't have to rely on him for help. Good luck!|`|pZg05uygaa	It will be harder to get over a breakup when you have a new baby than while you're pregnant. You will probably be more stressed out during your pregnancy being with him and knowing that he's leaving than you would doing it alone. You're right, he is being cruel. Don't give your baby his last name if he isn't going to take part in raising her.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Personally, knowing myself, I'd want him to just go.  Especially since he's acting like that....good riddance and honestly, your daughter doesn't need someone like that around anyway if that's how he's going to be towards you.  I know how difficult this has to be, and I am sure that his family would understand and be there for you anyway.  I wish you the best!|`|e8fzL3OTaa	What's wrong with him? That's the most retarded & screwed up thing I've ever heard. He doesn't wanna stress you out by leaving you while you're pregnant but told you he plans to leave when the baby is born? What on God's green earth is wrong with your baby's father? That alone would stress me out. I think you should leave & tell him YOUR last name will be your daughter's last name. That is screwed up.|`|mnvl5GlEaa	personally, i think that it's best to be alone, then with bad company.  you should just leave him now, because you are just hurting yourself. you can still keep in touch with his family- that shouldn't change just because you'll are separating. you and your daughter will make it through and it's up to you whether you want to give her his last name.  if he ain't gonna be there to raise her and isn't gonna be a part of her life, why should you?|`|jbz3NeSiaa	I left my x husband when I was 7 months pregnant.. I got a divorce.. And it has been me and my boy for 6 yrs now... Personnaly it was the best thing for us... It did hurt me to have a marraige end.. But it didnt hurt the baby....|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Well, I went through my pregnancy alone. My bf and I brokeup when I was 5months along. It's probably better to just let him go now so you can have some time to yourself before the baby comes to deal with the emotions. Having someone there would be nice but, not if you know it's only temporary. That will make it worse. Last thing you want is to be dealing with a newborn and heartbreak. Even if you don't care for him, you're still gonna hurt. Best of luck to you and congrats on the baby!<br>  <br>  I'd hyphen the last name or just give the baby yours. He wants to bail on all the hard work then you can bail on giving the baby his last name. That's just my opinion.|`|MLPzeOtOaa	If he is not planning on being there WITH you to raise the baby, I would not give the baby his last name. That is just my opinion.

It help optimizes female fertility and reproductive health.|`|f1nX6thdaa	It's so early...I think, to try for alternative methods!  Most doctors wait until you've past a year and haven't conceived, or had three consecutive miscarriages.  However, I have no idea what a fertility blend is!|`|srjPOxW7aa	I hope this link helps.  you could always go to a fertility clinic.|`|jzAfst8Taa	you should wait until after a year of ttc sometimes it just takes a couple of months
SjX72fPyaa	The one morning I went into her room to get her and I found her sound asleep like this lol:<br>  <a href="http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/Ashaminnie_2009/_MG_1597.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206...</a>|`|tbeO3Lataa	Oh my god, how adorable! I think he's dreaming of flying. LOL.<br>  <br>  Ha-ha, Alicia (babysitting client) sleeps with one hand down and one hand up, head to the side. It is so funny.<br>  <br>  Sorry, no pics. I'll be seeing her tomorrow probably. If I can figure it out, I'll take one and e-mail you.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	OH! so sweet.  My baby did the exact same thing as a newborn. Right now I can see and hear her on the video monitor and she is snoring loudly on her stomach with her little butt in the air.  She is 13 months.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	hahaha what a cutie! :)|`|uLdeIhHqaa	When my Daughter was younger (She is now 16 months) she would always sleep on her little side with her hands snuggled to her face. It was the absolute precious thing ever! <br>  <br>  Now, she is 16 months and rolls, tosses,and turns all over the place! Shes a wild woman now! LOL...<br>  <br>  BTW- The pic is SOOOO CUTE! Precious!|`|qBFojHLMaa	my little man always slept with his arms up when he was little. Now that hes older he sleeps with his arms straight down under him and his butt in the air. Everytime I catch him like that I crack up like crazy its so cute!! I need to take a pic of that positions to cherish :)<br>  Oh and my little guy is 18 months now|`|2ucsbBGjaa	haha, my son used to sleep like that.  but ever since he could roll over he would pull a pillow over himself and put his butt in the air.  kids are goofy|`|PBI3tCKaaa	haha!!! My four month old sleeps the exact same way. Maybe they are sidekicks?|`|txv7TIgiaa	my daughter slept like that when she was little now she moves around alot...|`|UcgWrGaAaa	My kids did it too.  Occasionally I do it too...try it really relaxing.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Oh my! That picture is precious! My daughter's 7 months and ever since she started rolling over on her own.. she's been sleeping on her tummy with her butt up in the air LOL
j2mRop0laa	I hated being pregnant. Sorry everyone it's the truth. I felt fat and slobbish. Hubby thought it was beautiful but I just felt like a sick dog. <br>  I was so over it by the 6th month as well. I just tried to sleep away the days.<br>  <br>  Stock up on movies and veggies and books and make the most of it, hon.<br>  Some people are not all roses and lillies when they are preg. It's not bad- it just is.<br>  <br>  I love my kids and yeah, it's worth every bit of it- but that doesn't mean you have to enjoy every single second of it.|`|rHufcHwHaa	I am 29 weeks and know exactly how you feel.  Of course I'm excited about my baby, but some days I tell her she's going to be grounded for the first few years of her life because of the beating my bladder is getting.  When I started feeling like this, I started writing letters to my baby, and they always took the focus off of how negative and blah I was feeling and made me excited again.  It's something to try, anyway  :)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Eat some ice cream, kick back, relax. Have your partner (I don't want to assume anything) treat you to a nice back rub. I know how you feel. My pregnancy was miserable. I was so b!t(hy I couldn't stand myself. Honestly. Lol. Oddly enough I'm looking forward to being pregnant again... <br>  <br>  In the mean time, I'll try to build you a time machine so it can get there quicker.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Move him around a bit (gently of course) when he is pushing down on your bladder, I've done it with all of my kids, and also find a different way to sit, stand or lay down when he is doing it, that works too!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I had my ups and downs with both.  The anticipation you have for meeting your new baby REALLY draws it out.<br>  <br>  I never went for months on end where it felt horrible.  But I had bad days, even weeks.<br>  <br>  I had the WORST indigestion with my second child.  I had an ultrasound at 7 months and he already weighed an estimated 7 1/2 lbs.  At that point I remember thinking I was as big as a house and he was big too, why couldn't I have him already??  <br>  <br>  Yeah well he was 2 weeks late.  He weighed over 9 lbs. and 3 years later he's still giving me indigestion.<br>  <br>  But ya know what?  You gave yourself some relief without even realizing it.  You where right when you said holding him in your arms is going to make it ALL worth it.  Also I think the 9 months is needed.  Good things come in time.  GREAT things come in 9 months!!<br>  <br>  So you know it's a boy?  Any name picks yet?  Just trying to help you pass the time.  :)|`|tkqV2CI5aa	Honey, this is my second too and i felt like i couldn't go anymore, i felt the same way you did. It DOES get better. Relax, know that your baby is coming and feeling him kick is amazing. I am 25 weeks and he rolls on my bladder 24/7. I just got to the point where i couldn't be stressed and i got to feeling so much better. It will get better and don't stress or hate being pregnant cause of the way your feeling. It gets better.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Don't fee; bad, I hated my last pregnancy too! <br>  <br>  Go  out and do something fun for yourself-go shopping, or get a massage or a pedi, splash out on super expensive and super yummy ice cream, or just spend the day hanging out with your friends!<br>  <br>  Once he's born the time will probably go TOO fast! I can't belieeve my little guy is more than 4 weeks old!! Ugh!<br>  <br>  Hope you start feeling better soon hun :)|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	Finally someone else who dislikes being pregant. I'm due with my 5th in June and I would have thousands of kids if I didn't have to go through the pregnancy bit. Everyone I know says they loved it, but I have never liked it, I feel so restricted in everything, and 9 months is a long long time to do basically nothing. But hold in there, time will pass.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Honey, be gentle with yourself.  Try to get a pregnancy massage.  It did wonders for me.  Especially when they worked on my swollen tired ankles!  I wish you the best of luck.  Read, meditate and concentrate on you.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|StJGeiFyaa	try treating yourself to a day at the spa, including all the milkshakes you can handle, that helped me :) good luck, your baby will be beautiful and totally worth it, i'm sure|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	just think its 40 weeks for a life time of happiness... i hated beiing pregnant too and swore we would only have 1 but we are already talking about #2|`|xVEqBjDVaa	This is how i feel, i think its normal though. You will love him and forget all about that though when you see him. It's okay.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Have a friend or sister watch your first born for a day so you can catch up on sleep and relaxation. Maybe you could get a support for your belly to help relieve some pressure?<br>  <br>  Edit: maternity support bands are pretty cheap $24 at this website: <a href="http://www.expectingcomfort.com/maternity-support-band.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.expectingcomfort.com/maternit...</a>|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Get a portable foot spa.One word:Amzing!
jkqHHhD7aa	omg get ur butt to the doctor that sounds weird! <br>  go asap|`|oqUlYXqtaa	you could test now since you're period is already late, good luck!!<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|ytobBcataa	According to what you said about your cycle it is very possible.  If you ovulated on the 19th or the 20th, your timing would have been great.  The spotting on the 26th and 27th could have possibly been implantation bleeding as well, because if you ovulated on the 19th or 20th, you would have been 6-7dpo on the 26th and 7-8dpo on the 27th.  Implantation normally occurs around 6-9dpo so that slight spotting sounds very promising!  Also, since your period is now due, you can now take a test and get an accurate result.  If you ovulated when you say you did, it would put you at 15-16dpo, and most women will test 2 weeks or 14 days after ovulation.  Some even get positive tests as early as 9 days after ovulation.  <br>  <br>  I suggest getting an HPT and testing in the morning.  Good luck and babydust!!|`|BCD3Xo6faa	That is possible. It fits the time frame at least. I put your dates in the fertility calculator on babymed.com and it did say that when you got the bleeding would be about the right time.  As long as you are past your expected time for your period I would test. Make sure you do it in the morning as horomone would be more concentrated. Good Luck!|`|GLzBI9upaa	The days you and your hubby danced seems like you could have targeted your ovulation day. being as though today is the 6th, don't know if you've gotten your cycle or taken a test yet, but all sounds like it could be pregnancy, but you need to take a test to be sure. Let us know if you did.
txv7TIgiaa	i think it is a pretty good balance but i think shes got her daddys eyes...|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	I think she looks more liker her dad but babies change and in a year she could look more like you.|`|T1x5jnj1aa	She is so cute! My youngest has that same sweetheart outfit! Did it come with a hat?<br>  She looks like you! She does look like her daddy too! AW! Good Job!|`|ovBNlMTsaa	you dark|`|r4E2zXL8aa	looks like her father|`|tTh2Q7etaa	awww how cute but she does look like her daddy|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Aw she is such a little doll!!!  But I agree with everyone else - I think she looks like her daddy.  But you never know, babies change so much and she may just grow up to look like a mini you!  =)|`|8RfmosODaa	a good combo of you 2|`|qBFojHLMaa	maybe you more but its hard to tell bc the pic of you is a bad one. Your glasses are glared and you cant see your eyes.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	From what I can see...I think that she looks more like her father. She is one adorable girl!|`|rFtKFp03aa	daddys color and hair.. your features..|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i think she looks like her dad
lD0VcAlpaa	The kicking is normal, no worries. As for the blood drawn, it's just like when people are scared of getting blood drawn who have those symptoms. When you get pregnant the hormones can take over and cause the same symptoms.
Yc6eUIW9aa	Sounds like he has another girlfriend.  Get him where it hurts...When the babies born file for child support.  It's free to file.  Then tell him to go and get someone else pregnant.  Maybe she'll do the same to him.  Also, what goes around comes around.<br>  ..|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Get rid of him and find someone better who will respect you more. Then after the baby is born, take him to court and try and get all the child support you can out of him!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Get an abortion and stop being an idiot.|`|XrC5x3gtaa	I only  have one thing to say LEAVE HIM ALONE.  Have your baby, put him on child supourt and raise your child.  he will be the one that is sorry,  He does not realize what he is going to be missing oiut on.  Is he young? He sounds very imature.  Good luck with whatever you decide to do|`|gPg7qYGIaa	well let see he def not hubby material and he wont be a good father tell him to go to hell and soon u will have your baby and u can find yourself a guy that will take care of u and your baby|`|35kVNi5oaa	I say get rid of him. Move back to where your family is, so they can help you with the baby.|`|AA11542929	you need to stop talking to him hun.. i went thru the same thing and i still am. and he has a girl.. u need to stop talking to him, stop answering his calls, and leave him alone hun.. dont put his name on the birth certificate or hell come and take the baby and nothing u can do about it.. iits happeninig in this world right now with that one guy who took his daughter from his wife and left and nobody can find him or the lil girl.. its over here in deleware if im not mistaken.. but dont let him get to u.. u can do it alone.. there is alot of single mothers out there.. be strong..|`|EZdHWa4taa	He has to remember that the baby inside of you is also made of him and that he or you can't fix it. <br>  Make that clear to him.|`|4e5c321b3099a1f6ff699e8cd693bc94aa	I think I would go home to mom without saying a word to him. What a jerk. Don't put up with that. He certainly doesn't deserve you and he doesn't sound like he will care about your baby.|`|Hd6bryI1aa	I can understand ur loneliness and how hurt u can feel when a man u care about says that to you. Mine wanted me to abort or hurt myself to lose it. U need to separate from him because that stress can be hurtful to the child. I'm not going to go into the whole your man is a dog speech because he's not the main concern. Your and your baby are.  You can hope he  comes around and apologizes but prepare for him to act like he has no common sense. This is not the end for you, it's a transition into a new beginning. As for being bored, is there anything you're passionate about? Even if you can move around to do it you can study up on it, take prenatal yoga the possibilities are unlimited. ( as long as it doesn't hurt the baby) I'm a dancer and have been using this time to study new techniques to help me get back in shape. Stay encouraged and enjoy this time of life.|`|HoonZJMgaa	Hi I feel your pain I have been there many years ago and then someone told me about the love of Jesus Christ. I made myself busy by reading my bible and going to prayer meetings because I was so depressed and I would pray for better days. It took some time but I realized how blessed I was to have my ex out of my life. Then I met the man of all my dreams. The man I had prayed for. He loves me and my children completely. He treats my children from my previous marriage as his own and all equally. I don't know exactly what you believe in but I will tell you this, you have a friend in Jesus no matter what you do and what you have done. And as long as you keep your head up and believe great things are meant for you and your child, you will get the respect and love you so rightfully deserve whether it may be from your child's father or someone else.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	hmmm. sounds like you got pregnant young, with a guy you didnt know for a long time, and now he is showing his true colors?<br>  <br>  that sucks...i am really sorry.<br>  <br>  You need to erase him from your life. and next time you meet a guy you might want to have a baby with, wait a while to make sure he is a keeper.<br>  <br>  until then, I will really pray for you to find happinees, and that God send his angels to watch over you....
LZk3z2ilaa	I am 37 weeks today.  I am thinned but not dilated.  You can request for them the check you.  Even if you aren't dilated right now it can happen an hour after they check you.  This is my second pregnancy and I know where you are coming from by 37 weeks you are ready to hear 2,3,5 cm.  Hold in there!  Good luck!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	hmm...i wouldn't think you'd start to dialate yet...but soon.<br>  <br>  i'm only 18 weeks pregnant. so i couldn't tell ya, sorry.|`|8wVj8odOaa	I was first checked at 26 weeks, then again at 37 weeks. The only reason my doctor checked me at 37 weeks is because I live a little over an hour away from the hospital and his office. Their norm evidently, is waiting until woman are 38 weeks. I was not dilated and it felt like the doctor had to reach up to my chest!<br>  <br>  I went in today at 38 weeks and 3 days.. I am 1.5cm dilated. I was told, "see ya next week or when ya go into labor" lol
9Y0LAUn1aa	i like Gracie Fey, its cute =]|`|SxPhldhhaa	My favorite is Sophia Genevieve. It just sounds so elegant and beautiful.  The others are very pretty as well, but they just don't have the elegant feel to it. My second choice is Alexia Trixibelle, though, as it sounds very strong and pretty.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	That's a pretty difficult choice, since you used three of my favorite names ever. :)<br>  Sophia Genvieve sounds pretty cool.<br>  Trixibelle is a sweet name, though.|`|9u0oWbphaa	Sophia Genvieve|`|QRi8yJj1aa	Sophia|`|TNytY4XBaa	Gracie Fey DiGiovanni|`|jq28LOeoaa	Sophia Genvieve DiGiovanni|`|LKt4RuEhaa	gracie!|`|YvF0kUsUaa	I like Sophia Gianne DiGiovanni.

It flows nicely. Then probably Gracie Fey DiGiovanni|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	Lucy Gianne DiGiovanni!|`|7ee80ac8606af76cab55c3608e92fedeaa	fav is Sophia Genvieve DiGiovanni
vOFdHvlvaa	Yea def. would, they are a good friend and obviously they know how to take care of children, i think that's a better option then a daycare center.<br>  If u hafta work to support ur family then there's not much u can do about it and havin ur son watched by a good friend is better than a daycare center, since u already know them and know how good they are with kids and there aren't tons more kids around. <br>  It would be one thing if ur family was close by and one of them could watch ur son the days u needed to work, but since they aren't the friend is the next best thing.<br>  Tell ur family to butt outta ur business, lol, well u can say it nicer than that, but they hafta realize that he's ur son and they  don't have any say in the matter.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if i trusted her ways of taking care of her kids, i wouldn't see a prob with it...gl|`|yB5go5wbaa	I would, absolutely.|`|dgRTkccBaa	It's better to leave the baby with someone you know is a good parent and trust.  It sounds like a good situation.  If you have to work to support your family you don't really have a choice.  Is anyone in your family willing to move closer to help you?  If not they should keep their opinions to themselves.|`|01vMpHkWaa	your a massage therapist? i could really use you right now lol <br>  <br>  but yes i would trust her...she knows how to deal with newborns and knows that when they need something..they need it at that 2nd and she would (hopefully) drop everything and tend to your son|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	If she is a good friend and you see how she raises her kids and agree with that then go for it.  I don't see a problem with that.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I don't really see a problem with it.. if she's a good friend and you trust her enough with your baby, then that's fine!|`|Emw1PBqXaa	If your friend is a great mom then there should be no worries there. If you have to work to support your family then you do what you gotta do. If your family is upset about this well then maybe they should do something to help you out rather than criticize you. Your doing what you need to do for your family.|`|955YoHvVaa	I don't see a problem with it..I leave my daughter with my friends all the time..I mean theres a reason you called her a good friend right? You obviously trust her to care for your child when you are away..go with it.|`|qBFojHLMaa	absolutely if I trusted the friend. I have plenty of "friends" who have kids that i wouldnt trust though. So if you trust her then yes, but if you dont trust her, her having kids has nothing to do with it.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	If I felt like I could trust her I'd let her watch my child. It would be a perfect world if mothers didn't have to work but that ain't how it is. Tell your family you know what your doing.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Definitely! She's someone you know and she has had the experience with kids! Good luck!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	If shes a good friend and you trust her... i dont see what the problem it. All the best :)|`|oXEEMAL0aa	honestly it's your baby and you are gonna do what's best for your baby no matter what anyone tells you or what anyone thinks.  Me personally i need the first 6 months to a yr to bond with my baby and to spend quality time with my baby.  They say the first 5 yrs are the most important and those are the yrs that will shape and mold your child's personality.  can you get financial help from someone so you can stay home for awhile? I live in Ontario Canada and here you get 37weeks maternity leave, paid and 8 weeks pre-birth leave paid by our government, do you not have a system like that there?|`|mapqQDrMaa	if you feel comfortable enough with this person and you trust they will treat your son the right way then go ahead, do what you have to do...<br>  its all about personal choice for you and what you feel is right for your family, if you need to work and make a good life for you guys in the long run, then you shouldnt feel guilty for letting some one you know, love and trust looking after your son|`|lD0VcAlpaa	If you trust her, that is all that matters. Mother's instinct is best and as long as you feel comfortable and have established clear communication with your friend about your expectations and beliefs, I don't see a problem!|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	I have a best friend who I completely trust, love and admire. She is a great mom who parents her kids the way I do mine. Not only that but she loves me and my daughter like crazy. So if I had to work I would definately leave my baby with her. She is the only one I feel that way about. If you trust her and feel she will take good care of your baby then go for it. you have to provide for your child, No matter who you leave them with its going to be hard because their not with you. but you gotta do what you gotta do. Trust your heart and your gut, best way for a mommy to do what's best.
JAdNkzENaa	i like Erin. <br>  every girl i have ever known named erin has been beautiful <br>  <br>  plus its not super common or traditional but its not weird either.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I like them all but; <br>  Alexa will become nicknamed Alex or Lexie<br>  Christen will go through life correcting people on how to spell/prounouce her name  She may also become Christy. <br>  Isabelle will be Issy or Belle<br>  Madelyn will be Maddy<br>  <br>  I only point this out because I have a'thing' about names that a nicknamed even if you do not want them to be.  I named my kids names that won't be easily shortened to a nickname.  You might not be bothered by that.|`|lhxe2XOeaa	i love alexa and madelyn and isabelle but i like isabella better<br>  i also like kristin spelt like that and erin<br>  i really dont like the rest though|`|G9wEDvedaa	Madelyn is my favorite because you can call her maddie for short :)<br>  <br>  I also like Alexa, Erin, and Isabelle
erKyfwSbaa	your uterus is growing and your ligaments are being stretched. It's normal.|`|MSfC0FXvaa	well im 29 weeks pregnant and im getting weird, sharp pains on my left side. really low. but i think thats just the baby sitting on a nerve.<br>  <br>  i think your baby would be much too small to be causing that much "pain". so more than likely, its just round ligament pain. which is normal. sorry... the joys of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  ya know... i guess the baby could be laying on your bladder and nerves already... but he/she doesnt weigh that much yet. so im not sure. if it persists, call your doctor's office tomorrow or something and see.|`|dRPblFRfaa	I don't know about that kind of feeling, especially if it is constantly doing it. Call you doc and ask him/her if that seems normal.
GWveqx61aa	i heard that the sperm that runs down your leg is dead sperm,you will still have good sperm inside. when you are trying to get pregnant you should stay in bed for at least 20 minutes afterwards.?~☆good luck☆~?
SBeDh1f0aa	this happened to me, too! except, I am about 2 days away from AF, and they started hurting yesterday. Usually they ache from ovulaton, on. I wish i knew the answer!|`|WaTezVS0aa	usually when you are pregnant, your breasts hurt. That is weird though that you they usually hurt, but now this month they haven't been hurting...
vKEYa8aeaa	her breath is stinky because of the cold. your sinuses and mouth nose, etc are all connected and when you have a cold/sinus infection anything like that, then your breath stinks because of the phlem.<br>  <br>  good luck! =]|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Your baby's bad breath is not coming from her teeth because most bad breath comes from bacteria that are on the top of the tongue and produce those bad smells.  You might be able to see this bacteria as white stuff on the top of the tongue, especially on the back of the tongue.  I suggest you get an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and a scraper and is very soft and kind to the tongue.  It is designed after the surgeons scrub brush.  Maybe you cleaned your baby's head with a surgeons scrub brush because many mothers use it to clean a new born baby's head.  Anyway the OraBrush is a great product for cleaning the tongue:  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think you should take her to the doc; she shouldn't have bad breath, esp that smells like that...jmho|`|955YoHvVaa	The same thing is happening to her as when you get sick..the cold is causing bad breath..if it bothers you get a wash cloth and wash out her mouth..or even buy a cheek and gum cleanser.|`|5135834c90cc2c12523172c90a0e1a7eaa	it could be because she's sick<br>  <br>  when normal people have bad breath it sometimes is because of not drinking enough water|`|GNLYxY7kaa	does she have any white patches in her mouth? could be thrush|`|lD0VcAlpaa	It could be a sinus infection. She's a bit young to be shoving stuff up her nose (ex: peas, toys, ect.) but that can also cause stinky breath (because it blocks mucous flow). If you are concerned, I'd call the pediatrician and ask their thoughts on it, it could just be nothing.|`|mJp5ygT0aa	I experience the same thing.

My girl was 8b 12oz|`|9P26sacKaa	I had my baby right on time - one week before his due date.  ^_^<br>  <br>  I say it like that because babies are "on time" when they are full term and are born on their own clock, which means sometime between 37 and 43 weeks.  <br>  <br>  For white, first-time moms, the average time to go into labor spontaneously is 41 weeks and 1 day.  Hispanic women tend to go a bit earlier.  I am 1/4 hispanic and my mother and grandmother had all their children before their due dates, so I fully expected to go a bit before my due date.  So family history and physical build do have something to do with it.  It doesn't mean that a short woman will go before her due date though, because what really matters is her pelvis and how long it takes for her baby to fully gestate.  This might mean that a smaller baby would be born at 41 weeks to one woman and a large baby be born at 38 weeks to another woman.  Every mom and baby pair are unique and every birth is different, even for the same woman.  <br>  <br>  Women tend to have their second babies a little earlier than their first babies, but that's just the trend, it doesn't necessarily mean a woman won't have her second baby later than she had her first.|`|3HR1SfGMaa	I delivered 4 days early, but that is considered on time by OB's.

mx3gFmIKaa	Whooping cough is pertussis, is the baby vaccinated, because he would have gotten the Dtap at 2 months old (diptheria, tetanus, pertussis).  This would decrease the chances of getting it.  It is an upper respiratory infection that can have complications (pneumonia).  Given that he has already gotten the vaccine for whooping cough once, and is breastfed so receiving passive immunity from you it should be ok.  Babies under 6 months are at higher risk for complications to whooping cough, but I agree relax.  I am going to look for statistics of immunity after receiving pertussis 1x.<br>  <br>  Call the pediatrician and explain.  Pertussis is given at 2,4,6, and 15-18 months.  <br>  Children who have received 3 of the doses have an 80-85 percent immunity (this is pretty good compared to other vaccines)|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I would keep him away from your dad as much as possible and keep breastfeeding as that will give him antibodies.  I would also call your doctor to see what they recommend of course.|`|oiJITSNZaa	why worry about it? Take life as it comes|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Please calm down, whooping cough is rarely serious.<br>  <br>  However if you are really worried you can go to the doctor and get a prescription.  Drugs only work if they are started the first few days with whooping cough.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis</a><br>  Characterization<br>  <br>  After a two-day incubation period, pertussis in infants and young children is characterized initially by mild respiratory infection symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, and runny nose (catarrhal stage). After one to two weeks, the cough changes character, with an increase of coughing followed by an inspiratory "whoop" sound (paroxysmal stage). Coughing fits may be followed by vomiting due to the sheer violence of the fit. In severe cases, the vomiting induced by coughing fits can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. The fits that do not occur on their own can also be triggered by yawning, stretching, laughing or yelling. Triggering fits gradually diminish over one to two months during the convalescent stage. Other complications of the disease include pneumonia, encephalitis, pulmonary hypertension, and secondary bacterial superinfection.[4]<br>  <br>  [edit] Transmission and diagnosis<br>  <br>  Adults and adolescents are the primary reservoir for pertussis. Pertussis is spread by contact with airborne discharges from the mucous membranes of infected people, who are most contagious during the catarrhal stage. Because the symptoms during the catarrhal stage are nonspecific, pertussis is usually not diagnosed until the appearance of the characteristic cough of the paroxysmal stage. Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on Bordet-Gengou medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence (DFA), and serological methods. The bacteria can be recovered from the patient only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks. For most adults and adolescents, who often do not seek medical care until several weeks into their illness, serology is often used to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another component of B. pertussis is present at high levels in the blood of the patient.<br>  <br>  [edit] Treatment<br>  <br>  Treatment with an effective antibiotic (erythromycin or azithromycin) shortens the infectious period but does not generally alter the outcome of the disease; however, when treatment is initiated during the catarrhal stage, symptoms may be less severe. Three macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin) are used in the U.S. for treatment of pertussis; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is generally used when a macrolide is ineffective or is contraindicated. Close contacts who receive appropriate antibiotics (chemoprophylaxis) during the 7–21 day incubation period may be protected from developing symptomatic disease. Close contacts are defined as anyone coming into contact with the respiratory secretions of an infected person in the 21 days before or after the infected person's cough beg<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/page3.htm#toch" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/pag...</a><br>  How is whooping cough treated?<br>  <br>  Antibiotics directed against Bordetella pertussis can be effective in reducing the severity of pertussis when administered early in the course of the disease. Antibiotic therapy can also help reduce the risk of transmission of the bacterium to other household members as well as to others who may come into contact with an infected person. Unfortunately, most people with pertussis are diagnosed later with the condition in the second (paroxysmal) stage of the disease. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended for anyone who has had the disease for less than 21 days. Azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are antibiotics which have been shown to be effective in treating whooping cough. It is unclear whether antibiotics have any benefit for people who have been ill with pertussis for longer periods, although antibiotic therapy is still often considered for this group. There is no proven effective treatment for the paroxysms of coughing that accompany pertussis.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics are also routinely administered to people who have had close contact with an infected person, regardless of their vaccination status.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if ur worried, call your doc, tell them this and see what they advise you to look for for the first signs that baby might be getting sick with it...it might ease your mind a little..
I7Sd9qd6aa	The earliest I have heard of is 21 weeks and less than a pound. my daughter was 31 weeks and 2lbs and 11 oz and though small was perfectly healthy, we were told that before 30 weeks the mortality rate is quite high. There are more likely going to be problems with the baby, but they can do AMAZING things now days. I watched so many miracles happen while my baby was in the NICU last spring. I never believed that a baby could survive being born so early and so small til I watched it with my own eyes. I think that along with technology love and positive thinking make the most amazing difference.|`|quNfHZULaa	My daughter was born at 24 weeks and weighed 1 lb 6.7oz.

AA11042493	Your body temperature can rise slightly when expecting. They call this incubation. A lot of blood that normal flows to your brain is being directed to you uterus, making you feel light headed. You need some prenatal vitamins to get over feeling run down even if your eating right.

Yes, my son is a little grub worm right now.<br>  <br>  It's pretty warm today, so he's in nothing but a diaper, something I can NOT stand when I'm out in public.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Omg, are you people effing serious?? Telling her to get off her lazy bum and clean up her kid? Really? That's just plain rude! She just said she's not messy, just a little smudgy.

I'm sort of particular about that kind of stuff though and I just don't like our kids being dirty (I know it's not really "dirty" - but still).

I normally keep his hands and face clean but I find that the day I miss a tiny smudge of Pb &j somewhere some one will come over and be like "EWWW, poor kid" I get so mad at them, but keep my cool. Most of the people that say something about it dint have kids or haven't had one in about 20 something years. So they have no clue how tiring it is. Im not saying a mother with a 20 year old has no clue what it is like, it has just been a along time since every waking second was focused on a baby.|`|u94HOVz7aa	if we are just relaxing at home i let them get dirty.  when i know company is coming or we are going out i clean them up.  i even have special just at home clothes that i dont care what they get on them so they can get grubby.   that way they dont ruin all their clothes.  they love it.  2 girls any excuse to change as often as possible is a good thing to them :)|`|lGcpXteaaa	wow...Some of these people are PATHETIC!<br>  <br>  Do your own thinking is right, keeping your child away from germs is a bad idea as you are not allowing them to build up a sufficient immune system.

I'm sure I'll be running around with her with wipes though. lol. BUT I'm all for letting kids be kids and get dirty especially if they're playing outside and we're just hanging out at home. I have a cousin who HATES when her kids play outside and get dirty. I babysat them all summer and when they got home from school I'd tell them to change into play clothes and we'd go outside. We made mudpies, played in the sandbox, and rolled in the grass. lol. Being dirty is part of being a kid. No reason to be "disgusted". It's not like you were parading her around town with grimy clothes and dirt smudged on her face.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	My son is 23 months and is always grubby at home. I wipe his face and hands after eating but he still looks like he's in good need of a shower. If your daughter had just eaten, it's expected that she'd have a few smudges on her face. No big deal. You can't keep toddlers pristine. When out, I'm always fussing over my son (which he hates), wiping his face, stopping him from getting his clothes dirty, worrying over every little bit of dirt on his clothes, using the antiseptic hand wash on his hands......at home though, the poor kid deserves a break. <br>  I think it's good to have a relaxed attitude at home. There are some parents who won't even allow their children "messy" play such as finger painting etc because they don't want their children to get dirty or make a mess. That is really sad.<br>  I'm surprised at your dad's attitude as well. If you had a boy rather than a girl, I wonder if he'd have the same attitude? My father and fil always say "leave him" when I go to wipe my son's face etc and use the phrases "boys will be boys" and "boys are expected to be a little grubby". But aren't all young kids expected to be a little grubby now & then, especially at home?|`|wphLaVs6aa	I wipe my son's nose as much as I can (cold season has been all winter long!!!), and his face after eating, but I don't stress if he has a little smudge of food on his shirt. Sometimes, when we are home alone together and I change his diaper, I don't put his pants back on (I put his diaper back on of course) and let him run around half naked. I know that's not grubby per se, but I always feel a little flighty doing it. He loves it, though!<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a big deal to let your child be a child and get dirty. It won't be long before they start getting self conscious about everything about their appearance. It's nice to let them be free a bit when you can. I imagine having mom chasing after them with a napkin or wipe all the time is downer.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	This is such a great question. After a long day with the kids, what better to do that pick oatmeal out of baby hair - it's pretty entertaining when there's nothing on the tube!<br>  <br>  Just having fun, my little guy gets grubby. He's on the go now and hates to have his face wiped, so I do it when it's necessary and during his bath. I only change his clothes during the day when the drool has taken its toll and he'd be considered wet (I want him to be comfy).<br>  <br>  Same with my daughter. We brush hair and teeth in the morning and then wow...can she ever get into it quickly! If I changed the kids' clothes or wiped them every time they had a little speck my life would be doing laundry and feeling like a nag instead of being a mommy!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay too much attention to the 'germaphobes'. It is a shame they couldn't just express their opinions without accusing people of laziness. But, since they brought it up, I think that succumbing to one's personal vices and imposing those vices onto their children is far more lazy than overcoming what might be unpleasant for the betterment of our children's lives. In other words, it takes a stronger more vibrant woman to raise their children in a home with fingerprints and kissie marks than a woman who raises her children with hand sterilizer in her purse and with constant nagging and badgering about cleanliness in a world that's not clean by nature. The woman with kissie marks is actually parenting and parenting well - and no person who parents well is lazy.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	It's good for kids to get grubby and at home is the best place for it. Let them have food stains on their clothes when they're at home and let them crawl in the backyard. They love it.<br>  <br>  People should be able to look however they like in their own homes. Surely if you are allowed to wear tracksuit pants at home your baby is allowed to have few food stains on their clothes.<br>  <br>  I think your parents are over reacting and perhaps a little bit posh. They have obviously forgotten how it is to have little toddlers running around the house.|`|B6tGYfEgaa	your father has major issues. completely disregard such ridiculous misplacement and emphasis on priorities. kids should be loved and cared for and communicated with. parents who put all their energy in dressing up their children and worrying about how everyone views them are at least partially (mostly) responsible for the sadness and disconnect in their children. they should be comfortable. and yes, sometimes they should get dirty. i'm so glad you're at least questioning it. question everything. the mass mind is a scary scary thng.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i havent had my baby yet but when i was a child my mum was a clean freak- to the point where i was not allowed to sit on the grass incase i got dirty!<br>  I dont think that a little food on her face is that big of a deal, especially if she had just eaten! it's not like it was going to stay there all day<br>  As long as my baby is happy and comfortable i dont see a problem in a tiny bit of dirt, i'd be cleaning them often anyway|`|AEXJcpmHaa	you do enough laundry already....geeze.....sometimes my daughter has a food stain on her shirt all day at the house....when we go out ro have people over shes clean but even then its not guaranteed|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I'm a mess myself.

I'm going to start working again in about a week. It's going to be hard :D<br>  Edit*** I love my baby. He's beautiful, cared for, and full of smiles. Even when he's a little older and has some spaghetti on his face, I will still love him. I won't think he's a nasty monster and try to erase his face with a wet wipe. So there!!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Bella's nearly two, she gets grubby everytime she eats. At home, i'm more relaxed than when we're out.

She sits up on her own so we just feed her on the floor in the living room when she gets solids (not too often). <br>  <br>  When we give her a teething biscuit or wagon wheel she'll make a mess with that. I kind of HAVE to clean her up after that because it's really sticky and dries up fast then it's hard to clean. <br>  <br>  I can't wait to let her roll around in a puddle of mud and post it for these lovely people so concerned about dirty kids.<br>  <br>  ***HMM, some of these people are pretty freaked out by your question. "OMG my baby has a spot on her clothes! QUICKLY, taken them off and burn them!" lol <br>  <br>  The last thing I want to spend my entire day doing is changing clothes and spot cleaning my daughter. She'll get an outfit change if she spits up on them or makes a big mess, but my goodness. And she'll get a bath at the end of the day so after her face is wiped I'm not going to freak out.

It connects the front portion of the uterus to the groin. These ligaments contract and relax like muscles, but much more slowly. Any movement (including going from a sitting position to standing position quickly, laughing, or coughing) that stretches these ligaments, by making the ligaments contract quickly, can cause a woman to experience pain. Round ligament pain should only last for a few seconds. <br>  <br>  <br>  Really, as long as you are not bleeding, you should be OK.  If it worries you, contact your doctor for some reassurance.|`|nISYAHkfaa	It can be normal to have pains during any stage of pregnancy. I'm not sure about the specific pains you're describing though.<br>  <br>  I would call your ob/gyn and ask him/her if it is normal, the doctor knows best after all. =)
HxlTayXIaa	Sometimes, you have to trust mother nature's means. Breastfeeding has been proven to be healthy, and as long as you're producing milk, there's no reason you should stop. On the flip side, though, at 11 months, teeth might start to cut and then weaning may have to take place. Don't worry if he doesn't "prefer" the bottle...if he's hungry, he'll eat. Patience, and proper nipple and technique are vital to the smooth transition. If being in the bottom 3rd percentile is accurate, then you probably SHOULD seek alternate means of feeding in addition to breastfeeding. Don't forget to check the baby's iron levels, too. Anemia is more common than you might think. <br>  Good luck, and hope all else is well.|`|dnLL4J71aa	breastmilk constantly changes to suit your baby's needs so whatever age they are it is always the right food for them. rather than switching to formula i would suggest offering more solid food at meals and if he doesnt take to that then more frequent breastfeeds.|`|txv7TIgiaa	formula gives babys exta fat that they don't need my daughter is breastfed and is healthy she is not fat and gains wieght slow too but that does not make her unhealthy...your son is fine...|`|DDIBEvUTaa	our pedi said breastmilk will help baby grow/fatten up faster than formula or anything else.  He sounds fine.  My son stopped growing for a bit btwn 4-5 months, even fell off the weight chart, but his doc encourage me to keep nursing & he gained over 2 lbs in 1 month.  She said some babies just grow in a "stair step" pattern instead of a steady curve.  It could also be that he is more active now, I think it's very normal for growth to slow at this age.  Trust your doctor and your own instincts. <br>  <br>  : )|`|WdvLcYaVaa	It is totally normal for your baby's weight gain to slow down and even stop at this age they are a lot more active and do not take in as many calories. As long as your dr. is not concerned, I wouldn't worry about it. Breastfeeding is wonderful for your child and you should never doubt that. You are giving him a wonderful gift.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	<a href="http://kellymom.com/bf/supply/enoughmilk-older.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/bf/supply/enoughmilk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/bf/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/bf/index.html</a><br>  <br>  I think your baby is doing just fine. And don't let anyone discourage you from nursing. The first link above gives some basic guidelines to tell if your baby is gaining weight well. It all has to do with wet diaper output more than anything. If your doctor is not concerned, I would not be.

You are not the one who has to have your name read out at assembly or go up to recieve you diploma, only to be embarrassed as the teacher calls out 'Avocado' or 'Pepsi'.

zGf8kBEkaa	Amblyopia (lazy eye) is not technically genetic, however, one of the main causes of amblyopia - strabismus - has a high genetic component.  Strabismus is when eyes are not lined up correctly which leads to double vision causing the brain to ignore the vision from one eye, which is amblyopia.<br>  <br>  If your lazy eye is due to strabismus, then she does have a much higher chance of developing the same thing.  She should be checked by a pediatric ophthalmologist or optometrist early on (before she turns 1).  Luckily, if strabismus is caught and treated early, the chance of it becoming lazy eye is greatly reduced.|`|Z7beKFCvaa	I used to work for an optometrist for almost ten years.<br>  I cant remember everything he ever said but I am 99% sure that its not.

Farmers don't grow apples and ship them to grocery stores for the goodness of mankind.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	@ Fajina: <br>  So if all you want is for other women to feel guilty about using formula, then "mission accomplished", as far as some of us are concerned.<br>  <br>  But why not focus your efforts on women who could actually change their choices, instead of women who no longer can?  That's what starts to seem a little pathological and fucked up, frankly, about your behavior. <br>  <br>  Lactivists encourage women to lactate.  You never do, you just try and make women who don't breastfeed feel bad.  That's kind of weird.|`|yB5go5wbaa	what do people think boobs are for?|`|LWXRVO5Haa	They make formula for a profit. If you think they make formula to benefit babies you are so wrong. The world would be a better place without artificial infant formula.<br>  <br>  <br>  "If a pregnant woman went to her physician and admitted she smoked a pack of cigarettes, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty for endangering her developing baby? If she admitted to drinking a couple of beers every so often, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty?<br>  <br>  Why such indulgence for formula? The reason of course, is that the formula companies have succeeded so brilliantly with their advertising to convince most of the world that formula feeding is just about as good as breastfeeding, and therefore there is no need to make such a big deal about women not breastfeeding."|`|6AvVVzsnaa	First of all, nobody has the right to make anyone breastfeed their baby and feeding your baby formula doesn't make you a bad mother either as long as your baby has food in their tummies. It's the parent's decision to either bottle feed or breastfeed.

How would not making formula make babies starve?|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Yes formula was made to feed babies who mothers didn't or can't breast feed.  And some people do have medical reasons why they shouldn't.  And if if a woman choose not to breast feed for whatever reason it's her right to do so.  I admire woman who can and do breast feed, but it's a chose every mom makes for herself, and as long as her child is fed, it doesn't matter how.|`|AA12243380	They make it to drive breastfeeding zealots crazy.<br>  <br>  I breastfeed now but I found formula really handy when my two oldest (twins) were infants!  <br>  <br>  My son won't take formula.

However, this condition does not appear to affect conception in any way, and most women with retroverted uteruses will go on to experience healthy pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Exercises: Women can perform knee-to-chest exercise in order to encourage the uterus to slip back into its proper place. Unfortunately, this tends to be a temporary solution for the problem<br>  <br>  So it seems that it isnt a problem. Just an FYI a retorverted uterus can have underlying problems. Pelvic Infl Disease and endometriosis but if you have been seen and they havent found these then i wouldnt worry about it :)|`|WaTezVS0aa	I am actually studying this in school right now, and a few woman in my class said that they had a problem with their uterus being tilted and they were able to conceive, but that it can cause a problem with delivery.

5h8bYsKdaa	nonalcoholic beer is fine while you are pregnant as long as you dont drink too much. dont drink it everyday. it has alcohol in it. first of all, many people will say "dont drink it it has .008 % of alcohol." I had it one time on my baby shower, i thought it was cute and people online scolded me for it. you could get more "drunk" off mouth wash lol i wouldnt drink more than 2 of them at a time.|`|dRPblFRfaa	As long as you don't drink it too much too often it will be fine! No worries. But just so you know it does have SOME alcohol in it|`|3gdLRGzWaa	Yes, there is no alcohol in it|`|XhIYAH6Laa	It does still have a little alcohol in it, but not enough to really make a difference. Just remember, if your used to drinking regular beer while your not pregnant, the non alcoholic kind tastes nothing like it. It is pretty gross to me...lol
TQScv7Tcaa	You don't need toys to entertain a toddler they have the greatest imaginations...make music with things from your kitchen cupboards pots, pot lids, wooden spoons etc, turn up the music and dance, make a cubby house in your lounge with blankets and chairs, cook with her make cupcakes and let her decorate them then have a picnic in your cubby house and watch a dvd to let her wind down....just try to think like a kid (hehehe i do that well) and have F-U-N!!!|`|0BjfEel2aa	Drawing/coloring,watching movies, maybe put on a little puppet show to show her mom when she gets home,maybe a little computer. Good Luck!|`|3CQ3qQ1Laa	Rent a movie she'd enjoy.. maybe two or three. Give her a pillow and a blanket while you and her watch them and she'll fall asleep.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Print coloring sheets off the internet.  I just found some cute ones today of Hannah Montana @  <a href="http://www.hellokids.com/search?recherche=hannah+montana" rel="nofollow">http://www.hellokids.com/search?recherch...</a><br>  <br>  If you have a deck of cards, teach her to play war, crazy eights, kings at the corners or Uno.<br>  <br>  You can also find fun projects to make by typing "kids projects" in Google.  I'm sure you could find something that you'd have all the materials for.  Like, maybe, tissue flowers?
hxdWDY3Iaa	Yes its very possible my son started teething @ 3 months & had a white stub on his lower gum give him humphreys pellets there @ any local drug store|`|75TRCPx0aa	i am 16 now and they said when i was 3 moss i had teeth like 2 of them|`|V7MYYe7Jaa	Yes it is possible.
m2aznd8xaa	yes especially since your body is going through major changes. if youve been feeling sick you should start feeling better by your 3-4 month|`|b2TDw4VIaa	yup especially if your getting sick a lot. I always ended up with ghostly white skin and small red dots on my face from straining when i pucked.|`|YJV2TU6taa	No I've never heard of that being a symptom or normal side effect of pregnancy. Consult with your doctor ASAP.
yVdW756Gaa	They would do a stress test on the baby and depending on how long overdue you are they could induce you. I was dialated for a month with both my pregnancies before I ever had them. They usually let you go almost 10 months before they induce you I think|`|vKEYa8aeaa	if you dont go into labor by 2 weeks after your due date they WILL induce or do a c-section. once you hit your due date and dont go into labor then i dont see why a doctor wouldnt induce you if you wanted to be induced. it isnt good for babies to stay in longer than 41/42 weeks because the placenta is an organ and it starts to deteriorate after your due date.|`|duinadV4aa	yeah probably very soon my doc told me that he'll only let me go over 2 or 3 days at the most hopefully i don't have to go through that b cuz i had to be induced with my first and don't want to experience that again|`|9EAW8PXkaa	Only if there is a reason for it.They usually wait til 2 weeks late to have you induced since they try to make the baby come as natural as possible.I was dilated at 38 weeks.Got to 40 weeks and no baby then had my son 10 days late and all the while i was dilated.It really depends on the doctor though and what your situation is.My son was scheduled to be induced 2 days later but his heartrate was dropping due to him laying on the cord so i went straight from the doctors office 2 days early.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Not necessarily, they won't send you to the doctor unless you are dilated to at least three. Try walking around a lot and having s*x. That will help you out a little bit.|`|V01NA68zaa	at 40 weeks you are not overdue.<br>  If you are already dilating with no contractions then yes, of course they will induce.|`|a1PcWRQOaa	probably yes|`|5UbC5hP9aa	I depends on a variety of circumstances. I think they usually let you go 2 weeks if you are not having an complications. The cervix becoming effaced, or thinned out, is often times more indicative that labor is nearing. Get to walking, walking, and more walking while doing you Kegal exercises!!! Good luck!!!|`|4XAGFz3zaa	Maybe.|`|AIPJBq5Faa	have you been eating bugs?
55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	It's not bad, but since you are so boy crazy, don't get yourself tied down to one. They will just try telling you what to do.  Enjoy all of them. Just get yourself on some good birth control and ask the boys to use condoms. Also, you should avoid drugs and aclohol so you don't end up waking up next to some smelly old, fat man.  Coz, it happens.<br>  <br>  PARTY ON WAYNE!  PARTY ON GARTH!|`|ojTcrqAOaa	OH!<br>  MAH!<br>  GAWD!<br>  <br>  LYK NOOO WAYZZ.|`|fNv2Re6baa	Just a phase your probably going through. Its okay to like guys but when you are liking that many at a time, its probably best to not go out with any boys because you will obviously change you mind a lot. Its okay, just remember, there only guys! Don't let it distract you!|`|R6K1Qnosaa	yes. But you can never like 6 boys at once. you may like 2 and have crushes on the rest of the boys. Crushes. Just think that they are crushes.|`|uin3ffWDaa	yea, and it's not a bad thing. i'm 30 something and i think i'm man crazy|`|oMveOFi9aa	yessss! LOL i have been boy crazy, and really am still a little|`|bxOkUEssaa	you are on the edge don't let yourself be overtaken with your hormones, if people are already talking about you it will not take much to get them saying things you really do not want to hear|`|Rt1FfBchaa	Yes, but that's expected from teenage girls, Plus how can you not be boy crazy, some of them are just soooo YUMMY~ if you know what i mean.   <br>  <br>  <3ilyJames<br>  <br>  BTW your avatar is the samee as mine: that's why I was drawn to your question :D|`|GiMJULi7aa	Hahaha!!! Well, in my opinion, it doesn't matter how many boys you like!! But if you want to take it a little further like getting in a relationship, ask yourself these three questions, Why do I like him>?, Is he my type>?, While im with him, would I be thinking of another>?. Hope this helps!!!|`|feQT7tWwaa	nahh your not completely boy crazy (:<br>  <br>  but the same things going on with me. it dont mean you have to date the guys your crazy for...or thats crazy for you. just be youself. a flirt (: just dont lead them on TOO much. lol just have fun. be young.|`|Yf2k2aajaa	Maybe. But it's not like there's anything wrong with that...(as long as you don't sleep with every cute boy you see). I used to be boy-crazy too, then I met my duckyscruffles and i love him and ONLY him!!|`|JUyJUZWOaa	YOUR BOY CRAZY.....Its okay i have a bff who is boy crazy and likes a new boy every day.....Put this in your head..BOYS AREN'T MY FUTURE over and over again or any time you see a boy you like it helps..|`|f0IlPkkTaa	just a little bit.<br>  6 boys.<br>  if i was one of them and i knew i probably wouldn't go out with you.<br>  Sorry just telling the truth|`|OohLY4g7aa	no!<br>  thats like totally normal<br>  ur probably just more expressive than ur friends =)|`|tU8OS32Yaa	Yes you are boy crazy to get over it read what a boy can do to you look on any hot gossip sites  look up Chris Brown.
EQsnhon7aa	They were pretty much all true for me lol. I just found out a week ago that I am having a baby girl and I have had severe morning sickness ever since I concieved her (5 days after to be exact). I also, don't feel that I look pretty at all unlike I did when I was pregnant before. And all I ever want to eat is fruit and veggies and sweets lol.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	I find out on the 16th... but I haven't had any morning sickness and everyone around me and the chinese gender chart are saying girl. We'll see!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No. I have 3 boys and every single pregnancy has been different. With the first one I wasn't sick one day. With the second, I did have some. But with the third, I was sick every day until I had him. I lost 20 lbs before I started gaining and had to go twice for IV fluids bc I couldn't keep anything down. The chinese calendar said 2 of them were girls. And the gender quiz said my third son had an 80% chance of being a girl. The only one that has been true each time is the hear rate. All of my boys were below 150..all the time. But they are all just fun wives tales for guessing. This time we decided to be surprised, so we won't know this baby's gender for a couple more weeks yet. Best wishes!|`|kWXik6phaa	yes it absolutely did. alot of older people would look at me and judging by size, baby position,how i was carrying,etc. they all said boy and were right. another lady told me that because i was having such severe morning sickness that it would be  boy. so...yeah, might be coincidence, luck,etc...but mine were right.|`|xLNl0f14aa	well my coworkers tryed the whole ring on a string thing lol and it was incorrect it said i was prego with a boy and im having a girl ..so idk lol. its fun to just try though whats it hurt?|`|POs5TeUDaa	idk about wives' tales but once i found out i was pregnant, my heart was like "oooh, baby boy coming ur way!!"<br>  <br>  and im now having a baby boy coming in june! ((:|`|JBEBIJCXaa	It's simple genetics that you can't predict the sex of your baby due to the 50/50 situation. Little things like morning sickness don't determine the sex of a child.|`|rDw9N09iaa	nope!! not at all!! i had a lot of morning sickness up until about a month ago, im 8 months now, but im prego wit a boy!!!
zjH9MDYyaa	yeah its just a vitamin
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Most people in Canada or the US that don't cosleep use "sleep sacks" which are warmer than quilts but can't end up covering the baby's head or causing rebreathing.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why SIDS rates are lower in Scandinavia, everything from diet, different disease levels, genes, vaccine schedule, etc.|`|mfiA5Hcwaa	My little one used to pull sheets over his head while asleep and it always frightened me, I now don;t use them - he goes in a baby sleeping bag to keep him warm
HtXYyZPqaa	If he's not an activated reservists then ask them to make him pay for the tricare PRIME. I mean it's like 415/year for both of them. It also goes on rank and what not plus the state you're living in. <br>  <br>  For example my daughters biological father is a reservists that's been activated. He has 5 kids... so, the 4 with his ex he pays like 700 or 900 for them. I can't remember. And, for mine the state of GA requires him to pay 27% of his income. Which happens to be like $636 or some crap. <br>  <br>  He actually wants me to agree to $300 since my daughters 5 months old and not hurting for anything. Which I may consider doing. If I do then i'll cancel my case and we just have it notorized. That way if I need it increased I won't have to wait the 3 years GA requires.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	I'm not quite sure of the questions they'll ask, however I do know from my time working for a lawyer in the past that it varies state to state. However, I do know that if the state grants you child support and there is any problem--the military will make sure that you are taken care of. They take it very seriously and if he even makes a late payment, it could land him in a world of trouble.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The baby's father is military. You should come prepared with all your paperwork in order, your income, your housing, etc, but the bottom line is the military does not allow dead beat fathers. They will make sure you get the child support your child deserves.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	When I went with my mom when I was a teenager the attorney general handling our case took care of everything. Just bring the birth certificate, your ID, baby's ssc, and maybe your proof of address and income.<br>  <br>  Regardless of your income he'll have to pay a set amount out of his checks. With military it is normally a 400 dollar a month minimum per child. They will most likely set it up to come out of his check and in to your bank acct so he never has a chance to NOT pay.<br>  <br>  I would call and ask someone at the court house what to bring just to be sure.
J3IRUUQhaa	yes, mine had the same. It typically resolves itself and is no real need for concern. My boy is perfect :) and I bet yours will be fine too!
R3UVYaHtaa	yes you are pregnant
CFFuFof1aa	Not necessarily, you need to make sure you take it with your morning pee. Your morning pee has the highest hcg levels in it. Also, don't use a cheap test. I have had bad experience with cheaper tests. Use a Clear Blue Digital test or a First Response. Go get it tonight and take it first thing in the morning.|`|do8pdlluaa	Tests can sometimes give you a false reading. Try again in a few days, and do it first thing in the morning.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1178393/family_history_can_be_a_guide_to_your.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>
gBnOqY5Yaa	I know this guy, he is just messing around, yes Kevin, use the paper towels, you pothead, go to sleep it's late|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Try it once, it's not going to hurt.  You'll soon see why that's a bad idea.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	Diapers are very expensive, but I wouldn't...they would probably tear when wet.  cloth prefolds are only like $1.50 each, & you can even make them yourself.  I've been using the prefolds, fastened w/a Snappi (like $2-3) w/ a gerber training pants (like $6/3 pack) for a cover.  Very inexpensive, easy, & reusable.  Also if you really want to save money and have the time elimination communication is worth considering.  During 3-5 months when I was still using disposables I was able to cut our "diaper bill" in half!  Very easy as well.  <br>  : )|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Cloth diapers will work a lot better.  You are going to run into a lot of paper towels and you will find it's not that cheap after all.  I bet you wish you kept your pants on now.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Use cloth diapers, you can get enough diapers for the entire year for less than $200<br>  <br>  Paper towels will just fall apart|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Um......no!<br>  Get you some cheap diapers from Wal-Mart.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Go ahead. You won't be doing that for long though, believe me.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yes diapers are expensive, but usin diapers comes with have a baby.  Buy cloth diapers and wash them if u wanna save money, but believe me usin paper towels and tape isn't right and u'll just be changin them ever 2 secs and u'll go through lots of clothes too (which are also expensive), so save urself the hassle of that and either buy a cheap brand of disposable diapers or buy cloth diapers.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	You could use a whole roll of paper towels folded like a diaper and You will spend more on laundry than ever! lol. Try it and see why. Go buy 5 dollar parents choice diapers or something. They are somewhat decent. Or yeah use cloth diapers alot cheaper to wash and re use.|`|bTqnkyIAaa	Why not cloth diaper?  You can purchase pre-folds for pretty cheap, depending on where you find them, and get a diaper clip and/or a few covers and you're good to go.|`|8db0578320f91700d4ffe30d808f456eaa	It won't hurt to try - it likely won't end up being that convenient though. Why not try cloth diapers if money is an issue? You just wash them out and re-use - that's what I did,|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	No, you can't.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	No, Target Brand diapers work great though and you can get a pack of 48 for only 5 dollars.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	do what you need to I guess, just make sure your friends dont see that, it looks real hillbilly.|`|ied3Ww49aa	Um, I am going to say no. I know diapers are expensive but there our plenty of reasonable priced diapers out there. Luvs are pretty good, not to expensive, target brands as well. If this is a serious question, do not use paper towels! You are going to give your baby a rash and it's unsanitary. Remember, it's a baby...your baby! Go down the diaper aisle you will find something.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|K3K3yM3oaa	how would YOU feel if you didnt have the self control to stop yourself from defecating, and had paper towels taped to your  ***?<br>  <br>  i dont think your baby would like that. GROW UP. babies are expensive, and if you think youre ready to handle a baby, be prepared to pay. <br>  <br>  A LOT.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Sure why not!! Brilliant idea!! Be sure to tell us how good it works by tomorrow night! And be sure you hold your baby most of the day. That will increase your brilliant decision to use paper towels. Soon you'll be selling them to other parents. LOL|`|PhkWt9vEaa	Wow. I feel bad for your babies' tush... That would be awful. What's wrong with cloth diapers? Maybe you could try infant potty training. It's kinda crazy, but it helps the environment.|`|MUbQsm2daa	Give it a go! How funny the mess you will have to clean up when your baby does a huge wet stinky poo. My god! Go and buy some cloth nappies and wash them yourself.|`|PK49Nodlaa	they probably cause a rash.<br>  think about if you blew your nose with paper tower every time you were sick. you get a rash that burns.|`|zCszcIAPaa	Just go to costco I get mine there its $40 for like 207 diapers and 20 for 700 wipes|`|lD0VcAlpaa	No. Buy store brand or cloth diapers that last over time.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Ya but your gonna be changing clothes a whole lot.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Why don't you buy some cloth nappies and wash them?|`|qKEKLOaEaa	the first time your baby poops you will understand why this is a baaaaad idea.

jiwTWNNtaa	Yes. I had vanilla flavored soft chew vitamins.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	you can take 2 flinstone vitamins a day instead and of course they are chewable. you just want to make sure you get 100% daily dose of folic acid.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	You can get prenatal vitamins over the counter. Also get Omega 3 supplements for the baby's brain development.|`|hoX7hoINaa	When you go to your first dr appt they will prescribe you the prenatals. Don't worry about getting them on your own before then. If you can't swallow pills, try crushing them and putting them in applesauce, pudding, or something else. I never used to be able to swallow pills until I got a medication that could ONLY be taken in pill form, and it was required for me to take. So I just sucked it up and learned.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Flintstones chewable vitamins, twice the dose for kids, is an acceptable alternative.|`|9P26sacKaa	Your doctor/midwife might be able to give you a prescription for something or you might be able to take a few children's vitamins.  <br>  <br>  That said, you really should increase your vegetables and fruit.  There aren't much for nutrients in supplements because your body does not process all of those minerals and vitamins very well at all unless they're in food.  Some people say you shouldn't even take prenatal vitamins because they don't do you any good.  This isn't necessarily true, but it does reflect that your body doesn't always recognize the elements in a supplement.  Your body does process vitamins and minerals from the food you eat though, quite easily.  <br>  <br>  It's best to increase your vegetables and fruit AND take prenatal vitamins or to supplement with the things you know you're not regularly getting from your diet.  There are certain vitamins your body especially needs during pregnancy and the best way to get these are to eat foods with them.  Supplementing is a poor way to get what your body needs and you may find yourself always being hungry and not getting the vitamins and minerals your body needs because you're not feeding yourself well to begin with.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.juiceplus.com/nsa/pages/Welcome.soa" rel="nofollow">https://www.juiceplus.com/nsa/pages/Welc...</a>  These guys have information on eating healthy as well as some great supplements (not particularly prenatally-related, but a lot of pregnant women do these because they're made from fruit and vegetables so your body gets more out of them).  They also have great gummy vitamins, which taste really good and are great for kids (and probably would be good for a pregnant woman who can't do pills).|`|98OlWbtXaa	I have a friend that has the same issue.  She just can't swallow pills, and she knows it's in her head.<br>  <br>  Anyway, she will crush a pill up in a spoon and swallow it.  She even does aspirin that way!  Gross!  Lol. But vitamins shouldn't taste bad.  If nothing else, crush up a pill and mix it in some chocolate milk or juice.<br>  <br>  Definitely go get a bottle, though!  You can get some over the counter for a good price at your local drug store.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	When you go to the tell them that you can't swallow pills. Maybe they have prenatal vitamins in a liquid form.<br>  <br>  But until you get to the doctor just eat right. And eat lots of foods with folic acid such as green leafy vegatables.<br>  <br>  This website is also helpful <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnancy/eat.cfm#nutrients" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnanc...</a>|`|PZkzhI9Faa	yes, the baby absolutely needs the folic acud to prevent birth defects...that being said; the fetus will drain your body of all he nutrients it needs to grow, so the vitamin is to supplement your body<br>  <br>  sorry, but i don't think there is any other than pill form|`|35kVNi5oaa	ask your doctor about taking a few flinstone vitamins, (they're chewable) and then folic acid pills. the folic acid ones are so small that with a swallow of water you can even tell they're there.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	yes hun there is they have flinstone gummies there like gummie bears and don't taste bad and give your baby the nutrient's she/he needs they work just the same :)|`|IjOEpqgOaa	You're fine.<br>  Try Flintstones. (its yummy chewy kid vitamins)<br>  <br>  The Prenatal ones made me so sick. My doc said it was fine.|`|xxkL46Yaaa	you can get vitamins in the liquid form..you can buy it from gnc. it doesn't taste the greatest....good luck!
OI3bf4yjaa	I wish I had a definite answer for you. When I was pregnant my belly button was killing me. Out of all the friends I've had that are pregnant or have been pregnant, their bellybuttons were sore too. I'm not sure if it's normal, but it never effected any one of us. I'm sure you'd get a better answer if you asked your doctor. It's probably nothing serious.
Cg4fWi3Baa	We just had a family BBQ and salads at home. I made some fairy bread for the kids and a teddy bear birthday cake. <br>  When they are so little, they don't really appreciate a full on party. They get tired quickly. If you have something at home you can work around your baby's routine too which helps.|`|vCWVimTzaa	we had a low key party with pizza and cupcakes at a park, and just decorated with some balloons and streamers. It was beautiful weather and everyone had a good time|`|Ppzuclr4aa	Does he have a favorite toy or tv character (like Elmo)? Go to www.1stwishes.com for some ideas on themed party supplies. Will you have kids of different ages at the party? If so, then I suggest a bear-stuffing party. Everyone can make a teddy bear (or other animal) to keep. Most unstuffed bear kits will cost from $10-$15 each. After the bears are finished... you ask everyone to close their eyes, hug them tight, and fill them with love. Not only will this activity be fun... the bear would be something that your son would love to snuggle and sleep with (hopefully).<br>  <br>  As for food, I would keep it simple for the kids... small sandwiches, fresh cut-up fruit, cheese and crackers, cookies, lemonade or apple juice. And don't forget the birthday cake (or cupcakes) to match your theme.<br>  <br>  Keep the party short... 90 minutes max. And don't forget to plan around your son's naptime. Take lots of pictures!<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Happy Memories!|`|0BjfEel2aa	Maybe pizza, and have a blue theme with blue cups, blue napkins, maybe even have a automatic bubble blower-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Bubble-Party-Machine/dp/B0002COIZO." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Bubble-P...</a> My little sis had one of these for her 3 birthday all of the kids loved it.|`|dRjB0isAaa	My daughter just turned one on Tuesday - we had grandparents only for guests, did pink cups/plates/streamers & balloons, ate pizza & I made her a cake, then opened presents. I agree with those who said pizza & cake for food, it's super easy.|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	I would suggest keeping it small and low key.  One year olds can get very overwhelmed by a huge crowd and a lot of commotion.|`|ied3Ww49aa	Good idea...keep it simple! I took my son to SeaWorld for his first bday. I was planning a big party but realized it wasn't worth it! A one year old still needs naps and can get overwhelmed and only want to be around his/her parents. I ended up throwing him a little get together so other family members could see him open presents and so forth. Even with a simple little party, he only wanted to be with me or his dad and then fell asleep for 3 hours!|`|6qCnpxrNaa	Pizza and cupcakes with maybe some other snacks or finger foods.
AA11603234	Try putting his toddler bed in his room first. Two new things might a little tough on them. Then I would use a twin or full bed pushed up against a wall with a bed rail on the other side. HTH!|`|AubmEoYgaa	The sooner the better. Don't let him get used to sleeping in your room. Get a wireless monitor that you will be able to hear him if he is up or calls you. I believe I would keep him in a full sized baby bed for a while yet. He shouldn't be able to climb out yet. Just keep the mattress at the lowest level. Good luck.|`|MUbQsm2daa	Because he has always been in your bed/bedroom its will never be easy moving him out too his own room. But you can try making a big deal about what a big boy he is and how he is so big he can have a bedroom all to himself. How proud you are of him and buy a special BIG BOY lamp/blanket/toy or something, and only let him have/use it only when he sleeps in his own bedroom. But expect a lot of tears and tantrums and maybe wait until your other baby is a bit older so he doesn't feel you are kicking him out because of the baby. Good luck!|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	I think he should have been trying to sleep in his own room, try putting something down on the floor to comfort a fall if that's your fear.A toddler bed is all that you need they have some with rails. Good Luck|`|m71EaUU0aa	My son is in a twin bed...with the safety bars on the sides so he doesn't fall..he has his own room as does his younger brother. He adjusted VERY well to it, once he got to the stage where I could say "big boys sleep like this...." he didn't like the toddler bed that my  mom bought him for her house, and I figured a twin bed saved money..I wouldn't have to upgrade later that way. <br>  My best advice, I saw you said he was co sleeping until recently, and thats great, but I would get him in his own room as soon as he is comfortable with it. My son was shakey about it at first to, but once he's in his own room, you truly will get more sleep! With less distrubances, and distractions for him he will sleep sounder..My son went from sleeping from 8pm-6am, to sleeping from 8pm-9am

INZ1LlHGaa	Emergency contraception is a high dose of hormones that does not leave your body quickly. <br>  <br>  You will feel the effects of such high levels for a while. It can definitely affect your menstruation and other things.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Yah, Plan B will screw up your system for up to a cycle or two.  It takes sperm up to 72 hours to swim up to your uterus, so if for some reason those guys were super swimmers, you could be pregnant.  If you already were pregnant (the next day) it wouldn't prevent pregnancy.  I am guessing you are NOT though because I've taken Plan B before and it's messed up my cycle for a few weeks.  Wait another week and take an hpt test.  You can also call your gyno and ask for their medical opinion if nothing on here reassures you.|`|5q5wq3i9aa	I Bled after the egg attached to the wall, If you believe there could be a slight chance you should really go to the doctors to see :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MOsStEbqaa	The plan b pill is what is making you have a period now.

a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Our son HAS autism and was responding to his name at 6 months as long as he was not interested in something else. Seriously- there are sooo many things that are looked at before diagnosis. One we looked at was hearing- he had 4 hearing tests by the time he was 2 because he seemed not hear us if he was focused elsewhere. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your baby and try not to worry.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	my friend who works in special ed said that children are usually diagnosed with autism around the age of 2. there is a wide range of normal in babies so i wouldnt be too concerned at this point!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Title and author of "a book" please?|`|JP2h62qiaa	I wouldn't worry about it. Just wait until the checkups come and if anything is delayed tell your pediatrician. My pediatrician asks if he is doing certain mile stones when I see her. Just don't get all stressed thinking he will stop listening to you.|`|AA10424047	There are many more "symptoms" to factor in, other than not responding to the name, to look for when it comes to autism. SOme kids are just slightly delayed.|`|iH2whFkHaa	LOL no, 5 months is way early to begin recognizing their name. Especially if you call the baby 'baby' 'sweetie' 'honey' 'cutie' or other things a lot of the time.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I hope you're kidding...you shouldn't be looking for signs of autism until the child is about 2!|`|AEXJcpmHaa	5 months? wow that seems way to early to me....my daughter is 4 months and sometimes i say her name several times and she will finally figure im talking to her but doesnt understand the concept that what im saying to her is her name.....i think she understands the tone of voice i use.....id def wait longer but dont be afraid to ask your doctor at your 6 month check up or call him/her|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Some kids just take their time. Nothing wrong with that. Get second, thirds, and fourth opinions before you begin to get worried.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	well mine did at 6 months im not sure about the autism thing tho
6qCnpxrNaa	I think you actually have to be 15 years AND six months old to qualify for a workers permit which you would have to obtain at your local courthouse.  Your parent or guardian would have to sign permission for this as well.|`|INZ1LlHGaa	Once you are 14, I don't think you need a permit to work. <br>  <br>  Just get out there and go to the mall or other places to see if they are hiring. If you do need a work permit, your school should tell you how to get one.
nISYAHkfaa	You sound successful and you're in a stable relationship . . . you're at the correct age for childbearing . . . so no, you're not crazy. Hell, I'm 21, I'm pregnant and my husband and I are both thrilled, as is both sides of the family. =)<br>  <br>  So no, you're not crazy, and I commiserate! I worry about being too young sometimes too. =)|`|AcuSzIVzaa	I know the feeling but you are really too young to settle down with children right now.  When I was your age I felt the same way!  I was with my ex-husband for six years before we got married and divorced after four more years.  I wanted a baby when I was around your age but trust me on this, give your marriage and your career three more years before going into children, you will both grow ALOT more between now and then, then when you are both ready, plan to have a conversation about it.  What type of parents do you want to be? How many children do you want to have? Where do you want to live when you have the child? Are your finances in order?  If you and your husband have similiar views then you are ready to have a child together, but I think after discusisng with other couples with children that most of them have VERY different views on how they want to raise their children.  Then, after you both have come to an understanding ya'll get busy.  This economy is going no where but down right now so consider facts before feelings and most importantly...Pray about!!!  Good luck girl and I hope that this helps|`|EZdHWa4taa	I'd say whenever you think you're ready. But with a baby comes responsibility. So.. it may interfere with whatever plans you have- to keep studying or whatever.<br>  Keep that in mind.<br>  Also, talk to your husband about it and see if he's ready.|`|ScJUXeEXaa	Have you ever think in the new responsibilities?<br>  How do you see your lives in the next five years?<br>  What about the world wide economic crisis?|`|35kVNi5oaa	Wait until after you  graduate and then try to have a baby. good luck :]|`|52U22fiAaa	No, you're not crazy, just do it when you're ready.  It's great to be a young mom (but not TOO young!), so do what you feel comfortable with.  Think about it long and hard though.
gx4s68s8aa	I would just take it, thank her for it.  And then later return it.  If she ask later on then say something like "after taking it home and talking to my fiance, we decided that we still like the one we picked out best"  And then you can show her what you pick out in replace of the gift.<br>  <br>  She might not ever say anything about it.  She might realize her mistake when she sees the nursery.  But don't feel bad if she does.  You aren't trying to hurt her feelings.  Honestly she is being a bit pushy by picking something out that she knows you don't like.|`|256cVXsmaa	wow tell her your taking it back.  I mean it is the thought that counts but she new what you liked so it was a bit strange of her to just go out and buy something she wasn't even sure you'd like.  It is your baby so if you don't like it take it back.  Don't be mean about it to her but I mean common she new what you liked and she didn't get that one so she has to be ready to deal with it if you don't like it.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	just exchange it and tell her you already had plans for the whole nursery based on the bedding set you picked out. be sure to tell her you appriciate the thought though.|`|duinadV4aa	just buy the one you want and keep that one to for a back up plan and you can switch off every once in a while it's just like having to comforter sets|`|9TAHh7tjaa	why dont you and your fiance get the set that you guys want<br>  and change it to the set she got you when she goes to your house<br>  thats what i would do:)|`|5f6XnInEaa	They are only bed sheets.<br>  <br>  Just go buy the ones you want separately, it's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  You change bed sheets so often that one 'ugly' set wont really make a big difference.|`|0F9b6g5vaa	hun i would find the one i like or something like it asap and then a little white lie that your in laws had unknowingly to you got it as a suprise and that you feel just awful that she spent time picking the bed set out but the in laws came and set crib up while you were at appointment apologize again and ask if there is anyway she could return it and pick something else off list for you its not nice to be in your spot but it happens goodluck|`|9P26sacKaa	I wouldn't be insulted by it.  Come on, people buy gifts like this.  I wouldn't tell her that you don't like it.  Just exchange it somewhere and be done with it.  She probably won't ever notice you don't use the set she got you, unless she's nosy like that.  People return gifts all the time.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Ask her where she got it if you don't know and return it. Get the one you want. Don't worry so much about her, it's your baby.|`|gaGeR55maa	You can tell her the truth unless she is one of those sensitive people. Than just tell her you already bought other stuff to match the nursery with the set you chose.|`|XDftaldzaa	Tell her doesnt go with your nursery theme, and you wanna exchange it to blend with all your baby's other things!!! :)|`|dxKDJAjUaa	wait til she gives iot 2 u then jus return it, if there's anythang said jus b honest!! but not rude! lol congrat and gud luck! :)|`|3HR1SfGMaa	Well with her comment I would say that it was a little presumptious of her to just assume that you would like what she picked better than what you picked.  Her actions were a little bit rude.  <br>  <br>  But at the same time, registering for a bedding set if there is no wiggle room at all on the style is also rude.  Registering should be more of a suggestion than a demand.  I did not register for any big ticket items with my daughter, only clothing, soaps, diapers, the little essentials.  That is what I feel baby showers are for.  So in my opinion you are also somewhat rude.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you should tell her anything, there is nothing that says you have to use the bed set that she bought you. <br>  <br>   Speaking from personal experience though, my aunt actually hand makes crib sets.  As a surprise a package showed up from her about a week before my baby shower was set (she lives far away from me)  To my surprise I opened the package and it was a complete crib set that she hand made for my baby.  While it may not have been exactly what I would have bought in a store, it was given with so much love that I adored it.  My daughter is 2 and no longer in a crib but I still have the set.  She still uses the blanket, the valences, and the pillow that my aunt made.<br>  <br>  I guess the moral of the story is you should appreciate what she did because it was done out of love.
mx3gFmIKaa	I have successfully avoided antibiotics for my 3 kids by preventative medicine, in three years they have each had 1 antibiotic.  OTC cold meds are the lesser of two evils when comparing otc meds to antibiotics.<br>  <br>  We use dimetapp children's cold and cough, grape flavor and mucinex<br>  <br>  I have heard good things about triaminic.  Delsym I have used with excellent results|`|dgRTkccBaa	Last time my 2.5 yr olds had a cold the nurse told me they're now recommending no cold medicine until SIX years old.  I almost fainted, but since she refused to give me the proper dosage we suffered through it with a humidifier and saline nose drops.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	i hear ya. the best thing for the common cold even for adults is a saline wash. you sniff a little up your nose and the salt in the saline wash drys out your sinuses(like salt on a slug). it will even help for a sore throat. i promise its the best thing you can do for your child, they wont be to happy about the whole water up the nose thing, but it works.|`|DKqsFGymaa	My favorite cold medicine for children is Triaminic.  You can pick which formula you need to fit the symptoms the child has.<br>  <br>  If I'm going to give my children medicine, I want it to take care of the ailments and Triminic never let me down.  You can even buy a night-time formula to help them sleep.|`|nDEVWjCEaa	I use Tylenol either cold or cough and runny nose stuff.. They work best for my children. I don't like Advil or Triaminic, i found that they didnt work as well...|`|5s0GQsTQaa	in my experience... over the counter cold meds do NOT work for children...... ( docs are not recommending them now any how..) <br>  the saline thing the first person suggested tho.... that is probably ur best bet for the stuffy nose.... and if ur child has Post Nasal Drip...( when snot and what not drips down the back of the sinuses and into the thorat....) it will make them cough as well..... <br>  i have been thru the same thing as you with my boys!!! many many times.... and i know how frustrating it is!!! <br>  but try tha saline solution.... ( sometimes ur doc can give u a script for little tubes of it... makes it easier to squirt into the kids nose...)  or u can just make ur own... tiny bit of salt in warm water... use a nasal aspirator....  hold ur child's head forward tho.. let it run out. they also sell it over the counter... in fancy little aspirators that are made just for this purpose!!! lol.. its up to u on how u decide to do it...<br>  but i am sorry this is so long......<br>  run am humidifier in the bedroom at night .... it may help.... or vaporizer.... <br>  try giving a warm drink for the cough..... like caffeine free hot tea..( not too hot tho obviously!) <br>  any ways.. good luck....<br>  sometimes all u can do is let it run its course too.. thats the hard way.. but sometimes the only way =[|`|dRjB0isAaa	I wouldn't give my child any over the counter cold medicine, I don't even take it myself! I would give them Sambucus - it is an all natural syrup made from elderberries and is safe for children. Also, if you notice them just starting to get sick, this stuff can stop a cold before it starts. I use an adult version and have the same results.|`|P7EA6loGaa	ive used tylenol cold & sinus...<br>  however i like to just use humidifiers, vicks and natural things. like you i am terrified of cold medicines.|`|VxHu4yBeaa	I like trimantic and delysem they both work really good.|`|qbogLlFyaa	Triaminic works good for my child|`|iZfHSwi3aa	I agree with the first poster.  Saline rinse is both effective and absolutely safe.  However, I find my son absolutely HATES most nasal sprays.  No remedy will be helpful if you can't get your child to take it.  Luckily, they now make an aerosol like nasal rinse for kids.  Both "Baby Air" and "Little Noses" have them (and I imagine there are likely local brands in some areas of the country).  With these you have to rinse a little longer (three-five seconds per side vs one quick spritz) , but they are so much more gentle that alot of kids don't mind as much.  My son will do them without complaint.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I think there are alot of worries out there over nothing.  If your child cannot sleep and rest, he/she will not get better.  Thus I like good ole Dimetap for night times - or Triaminic Night Time Cough occasionally.  <br>  <br>  I also like to use a vapor rub, though the one I use is much stronger than Vicks.  I recently read an article saying that vapor rubs actually produce more mucus and can choke children.  I just don't understand that.  Vapor rubs opened up my nasal passages wonderfully as a kid, and always made me feel better.  They've always helped my son too - especially with croupy coughs.   We use a vapor rub called "Skinners", but you usually can only find it in "alternative medicine" stores, some chiropractors, and online directly from the manufacturer.  Three generations of my family has used this stuff with great success!  I'm not saying the study is worthless, but I do think that perhaps something was lost in translation between study ferrets and the usefulness in humans.  <br>  <br>  While my doctor has ceased recommending any OTC general cold medicine (such as Dimetap or triaminic, etc) she DOES still recommend Mucinex when my son has a bad cough or severe congestion.  I guess it hasn't been proven unsafe and it DOES have real effects in loosening congestion.  One tip though, although the mini-melts look like a wonderful idea (medicine in a pixie stick) they are NOT!!!!  I know at least three families who have bought them and had to throw the box away because their children (scattered ages between 3 and 12) absolutely would not take them.  My son gagged and vomited the one time I tried to use them with him.  Luckily, while still not tasty, the elixir does not seem to provoke the same response in kids.  I highly recommend getting the store brand though, since the name brand is extremely pricey.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helped!  If all else fails, Tylenol and Popsicles can make most kids feel better.
kyqhMuSiaa	Cycles can happen on any day of the month. They don't go by calender months, day to day. Your cycle might be 35 days. Every ones cycle is different. Mine is never regular and comes every 30 - 38 days I just never know. If you are definately regular every month it could be a pregnancy sign.|`|ZTVgoovaaa	A normal cycle is 28 days apart....<br>  Many women have a cycle that is between 28 and 31 days apart, so this would mean that you wouldn't have your cycle the same day every month.  Get a Home pregnancy test.  They can tell you if you are by now.  You can only get pregnant 2-3 days a month, so you most likely aren't.
N89HLv92aa	Adoption or raising it on your own is really your only choices. Thank you for not choosing abortion. You must be very mature for your age. I think you would probably make a great mother. I know you werent expecting this to happen so soon, but it did. You are very lucky that you are able to have children. My husband and I cant have them. So please be appreciative for your gift from God.   Good Luck in your decision and God Bless!!|`|1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	Your options are a bit limited.  Once you find out you're pregnant, you can either have an abortion, give it up for adoption or keep it.  <br>  <br>  You're very young and I understand your apprehension.  I got pregnant when I was 16 too.  I ended up miscarrying on Valentine's day.  My boyfriend and I spent that day at the hospital.  It was all for naught since there's not much they can do in that early of a stage (I learned I was pregnant only days before I miscarried).  It was definitely for the best.  <br>  <br>  I've been through two miscarriages and one abortion.  Let me reassure you, no matter what anyone else may say; abortion is not that bad to go through.  But be sure it's what you want to do.  Too many people have one in desperation and that's not the right frame of mind to have one done.  The ones that don't think things through clearly and act impulsively are the ones who end up regretting it.  Then they go around and tell people that since they regretted theirs, EVERYONE regrets it.  I thought mine through and don't regret it in the slightest.  <br>  <br>  Cindy D, you're a moron.  Listen up: I'M GLAD I HAD MINE.<br>  <br>  There, now you've heard someone say it.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	well you can choose adoption and meet with the adopting parents and visit with them, keep them updated on the pregnancy, that way it might make it easier on you to give the little one up!<br>  <br>  or....<br>  <br>  you can always keep your baby and give them all your love...i know your young and probably scared..but its your decision what you want to do..not your mothers..i was scared to when i found out i was pregnant and im 20..i think the first few months of my pregnancy i had some depression because i thought my life was going to be over because of this...but i am 31w4d pregnant now and let me tell you, i am so excited and happy, and anxious for my little guys arrival...i feel so blessed and grateful and i actually think i am happier now than i have been in a long time!

You actually get to pick and choose and interview the families who wish to adopt your baby and you also are able to still be in the babies life. I, myself am very strongly Pro-Choice, which means I don't believe in abortion, I'm not overly religious or anything like that but open adoption is one of the many concious decisions and wonderful choices for pregnant women. You do need to keep in mind that you had sex and it's your responsibility for what happened because of that action. I'm only 18 myself, but you have more options than abortion, don't be ignorant. Here's some info about open adoption and I hope it helps you =) <br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  The adopted child has the potential of developing a one-on-one relationship with his or her birthfamily. It is not about the adoptive parents bestowing birthparents with the privilege of contact, nor is it about birthparents merely being available to provide information over the years. Direct contact, in the form of letters, phone calls and visits between the birthfamily and the adopted child, along with his adoptive family|`|dxKDJAjUaa	u need 2 b very careful wat choice u make..i understand u are young u r scared ur mommy's prob scared, but if u cant keep the baby put it up 4 adoption, cauz most people regret havn an abortion, its killing a baby, i mean if u were 9 mon preg, and you delivered ur baby, wouldnt it b murder 2 kill it as soon as u have it?

Can you really take care of this child and give up all the joys of being a teen? Can you finish school? You need to sit down and think about what is best for your life and the answers will come after. I know your scared and going through a lot of emotions right now and your mom is to and just wants what is best for you so together sit down and weigh out what you think will be best. Any decision you will make is going to be a difficult one but you will get through it and know that whatever you decide is for the best. If it is abortion then do not let all these crazy people tell you your wrong because no one is in your shoes or knows what is best for you and your life. If it is adoption then there are ways you can keep it open so you can get to know the parents that will get your child and stay in contact. And if it is to keep it then just do your best to finish school and be a good mom.

He may just be going through a growth spurt too.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	you don't have to wait until he is 3 months if he is hungry feed that baby. people usually start with rice cereal because baby's are less likely to be allergic to it. just put a teaspoon or two in his bottle. you can even mix up a little in a bowl, that's what i did for my daughter at two months old and she did just fine.|`|qBFojHLMaa	Let him eat as much as he is hungry. He wont over eat dont worry. And dont put cereal in his bottle. My son hated that. i know some people say its awesome but just dont do it. If you feel the need to give him cereal then spoon feed it to him. It tends to clog up the nipple so just dont do it.|`|1xNVPECpaa	for me that seems unusual.. but maybe he is in growth spurt. could be..<br>  <br>  but every baby development is different
KICQQxLxaa	I chose not to breastfeed out of ignorance and lack of knowledge about the subject.  My mom and MIL never breastfed, nor did many other family members, so I was not use to or comfortable with the idea.<br>  <br>  However, I joined a mom's group 3 months after my DD birth, and most of the mom's nursed.  Through that, and interesting reading from Y!A, I will breastfeed any future children I may have.<br>  <br>  I don't regret formula feeding my child, I made the best decision with the information that I had.  My DD is healthy and happy, and that is all that matters to me : )<br>  <br>  ETA: " I'm a redhead and redheads feel pain stronger than most people"  WTF??  That is the lamest thing that I have ever heard!!  My hubby is a redhead, and he has a super high pain tolerance....|`|SjX72fPyaa	My daughter couldn't latch properly even though we went to see lactation specialist and she started to lose to much weight so I switched her to formula in order to keep track of how many ounces she was eating.|`|uCLenopbaa	i breast feed exclusively for almost 2 months (except i pumped a few times)<br>  <br>  i then got sick of pumping on all of my spare time. and i will not breastfeed in public (i have a nipple shield that  i must use for latch on issues, and don't want my boob exposed while i am placing it on. i don't have a nursing bra, and i'm scared of someone seeing my breasts or what if my baby starts choking and i exposed to the world..)<br>  <br>  i started feeling helpless and like i had no life since i stayed home ALL the time JUST so i could breastfeed.<br>  <br>  so now, i breast feed when i am at home. and when i am out and about i use formula. i am a lot happier!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I didn't want to. That's my main reason.<br>  <br>  However, I did have to have kidney surgery 3 wks after she was born. I was on pain meds for about 2 months because of my kidney problems. I also take steroids for Crohn's disease. But I don't need medical excuses. I chose not to and my baby is happy, healthy, and thriving. And when it comes down to it...my baby, my boob, my choice.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	well i didnt really have a choice, i was a new mum and had so many different midwives showing me how to breastfeed (all of which were not working btw) she wasn't latching on properly and i found my nipples starting to scab and weep slightly. i tried pumping for a couple of days, but couldn't get much out and found it was making my nipples bleed, which made it even more painful. so now i know that the next time i have a baby, i well prepared with a breast pump for the word go!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	I just chose not to.I started with my first but was really uncomfortable about it.Bottle fed both my boys and have no regrets.I ALWAYS held and fed my babies.They never had a bottle in bed.My first  son wouldn't even hold his bottle till he was 9 months old.I hate it when people criticize other people's choice.I love my children and would never jeopardize my boys' health.We were totally confident in the choice of formula and our boys health.|`|FWqK710Yaa	I have 2 reasons that I choose not to breastfeed. The first is that I am uncomfortable with it for myself. I have no problem with other people doing it but it wasn't for me. Also I have Asthma and take a lot of medication that I can't always time around a baby's need to eat. Thankfully both of my children did and are thriving on formula so in the end all that really matters is that you have a happy and healthy baby, however you choose to feed them.|`|782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	I had to go back to work after 6 weeks. I figured with my job it would be hard to pump during the day. I thought about doing both at first, but she was born 4 weeks early. I didn't even produce colostrum (spelling?) for almost a week after she was born. She had some feeding issues so I just decided by that time she was doing well with the bottle I didn't want to confuse her. <br>  <br>  If I have anymore children, I'd like to try even if its just for the first six weeks.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	My Choice was too breastfeed before I even got pregnant, I wanted to do this because it is natural, best for baby and FREE! Unfortunately my baby came at 31 weeks and had to be tube fed, then bottle fed to make sure she got the calories she needed. I pumped for 5 months and tried breastfeeding for 4 of them, but my daughter liked the bottle better because it was easier for her. once she quit nursing I lost my milk supply.|`|G6eBvDz8aa	I attempted and BADLY wanted to breastfeed..  after 3 consults while STILL in the hospital -- and 2 at home consults after coming home.. a week and a half after she was born, we stopped breast feeding and went exclusively to bottle.. She was not latching correctly and would always play around with the nipple and it hurt so badly.. No matter what I or the LC did, we couldn't get her to latch! I was bruised and bleeding and it was horrible.. Stupidly, I didn't pump as often as I realize now I should have causing my milk to dry up.. Also, my freakin pump broke!! And we didn't want to spend another $60 on a new one.. so we just switched to formula.. BUT when I did pump, I gave it to her, obviously..|`|AA12243380	I gave it up when my twins were 3 weeks old because it was just too hard for me to keep it up.<br>  <br>  I am breastfeeding my 3 week old son (my twins are toddlers now) for the same reasons you are.  It's the easiest way to feed him.  It's free, it's always available, and it's got all the health benefits as well.  I can understand why moms formula feed, though.  I honestly can.  I did it myself with no regrets given how different my life was then.|`|T1x5jnj1aa	I choose not to breastfeed because it was too difficult. My nipples hurt and my baby was crying.<br>  I gave him a bottle of formula and he was content for 3 hours!|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Leading up to having my baby I just assumed that I would breastfeed.  I went to breastfeeding classes and bought a pump for when I returned to work.  When my son was born we started breastfeeding like normal.  He latched well and I thought that he was doing great, then I got a rude awakening.  He didn't have enough wet diapers and his pediatrician would only release us from the hospital after the lactation consultant taught me how to use a supplimental nursing system.  He had lost so much weight that we had to go to see either the LC or the Doc every other day.  At the sessions with the LC they would weigh him before and after a feeding (1hr) and he only gained 1 oz.  Each feeding started at the breast for an hour, then he got 2 oz of formula with the supplimental nursing system, then I pumped for 20 minutes (with a rented hospital grade pump).  We carried on like that for a month.  It just became too much for me.  I finally broke down one day with the lactation consultant and she just looked at me and said "You did your best, you just need to feed your baby."  Then the doc came in and said that a formula fed baby with a healthy mom is better off than a breastfed baby with a stressed out mom."  I still wish it would have worked, but I feel good knowing that I gave it a shot and I'm doing what is best for my baby.  He's happy and extremely healthy.  I spent more money on lactation consultants than I have on formula so far.  I know that you're not being a "boob ****" but I really wish those women that could be classified as such would just shut up and try to understand how hard it is for some of us.  I feel good about where we are now and I don't need other women telling me that I'm a bad mom for doing what needed to be done.
lB405hQKaa	You should for sure test!!!  it sounds like you know your body quite well after ttc for so long.  If something feels different AND you are four days it sounds like this may be your month.

yDWcYXl5aa	As a karaoke DJ, I know that even when one isn't pregnant, it's hard on the body and mind to be in clubs.  The loud noise interrupts sleep patterns when you do go home, it raises blood pressure, and face it, there are some idiots everywhere, that when they get drunk, they end up doing stupid stuff and fights occur.  It would be ten times harder for you to get out of an area that's busy without hurting the baby, than if you could slip out through the crowd easily.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, there's lots of smoke.<br>  <br>  I did have a friend who was also a DJ, who worked until the week before she had the baby.  They stayed with me after the baby was born, and for a long time, he acted like he didn't hear things like other babies.  Also, he woke up a lot in the night, screaming, as if he were being beaten.  His first few months were really rough.  <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor why you're sore down below, and in the pelvic area.  It sounds like at this point, you might have ruptured something, or have a bladder infection.  Good luck, but going to clubs isn't worth the trouble it could cause.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	girl i be blasting my music in my car, i don't think u have anything to worry about! And i used to go out all the time, now i'm too big and tired! (39 weeks 4 days)|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Well, if you are clubbing there is always the chance that you may get jostled or hit in the belly(which is not a good thing)|`|Zn7NNavKaa	ONE IF YOU ARE SORE THE CLUB IS NOT WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. I DONT THINK IT CAN START LABOR BUT I DONT THINK ITS GOOD. YOU SHOULD REALLY ASK YOUR OBGYN, NOT YAHOO ANSWERS.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	thats stupid people could bump into you and make you fall. people get into fights all the time at clubs. don't risk it|`|MMx7TeEBaa	I went out a couple of times when i was between 20-30 weeks of pregnancy (i didn't drink either) and i stopped because of the risk that someone may bash into me. Or you could fall down hard and risk losing your baby. If you do go out i would stay sitting down and stay out the way off groups and crowded areas and drunken idiots lol<br>  Also my daughter used to kick like mad to music, your not harming them from the noise or vibrations and you won't set of labour they are very protected in there :)|`|ZvkX9uNraa	A club is not a place for a pregnant woman. If nothing else, your baby does not deserve to be exposed to the second hand smoke that is in the air. I have been bumped into, knocked over and almost gotten in fights in a club (prior to pregnancy of course) and it's just not the place for someone who is carrying a baby.|`|xAnbIqtAaa	If you're just going once it's probably ok, but like someone else said you do have to worry about other people bumping into you especially if they're drunk.  I don't think the music could harm your baby though, just becareful of the people around you (and please don't drink).<br>  <br>  Edit* Where do you guys live that you can smoke in clubs?  I thought they banned that awhile ago.|`|xxkL46Yaaa	the music will be fine for the baby...however nightclubs really are not  good place for someone pregnant.  There generally is ton of people there.  Someone could elbow you.You could slip or trip.  A bar fight could happen and you could get caught in the middle...there is so much that could happen.  Wait till youve had the baby youre going to be pregnant too much longer.|`|GLJkGgloaa	Your better off making wiser choices.<br>  I would avoid those places for a while.
703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	You didn't say what kind of pump you use, but if it's a double electric I'd try switching sides.  For one session use the left side of the pump for your right breast and the right side for your left.  My main concern would be that it's not you but the pump.<br>  <br>  If you try switching sides and get the same result, are you certain you're using the right size flange?  This can affect whether or not your breasts get emptied completely.  One of my favorite bloggers did an article on this recently (<a href="http://breastfeeding.blog.motherwear.com/2009/02/do-you-have-a-good-flange-fit.html)," rel="nofollow">http://breastfeeding.blog.motherwear.com...</a> and there are pictures to help you figure it out here:  <a href="http://www.ameda.com/breastpumping/most/fit.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.ameda.com/breastpumping/most/...</a><br>  I used a flange that was too large for a long time before I figured it out.  It's even possible that you may need a different size flange for each side.<br>  <br>  If that's not it, I would just finish up the left side, turn the pump up a notch (if it's not painful) and keep going on the right.  This happened to me sometimes.  It is normal for one breast to produce more--my right one definitely did--and therefore that side sometimes took a little longer to empty out.  I wouldn't worry about it, unless it is a problem with your pump--particularly if you didn't get one of the better brand names or if you got it used.  If you find out that one side of your pump is not as strong as the other (be sure to troubleshoot the entire assembly piece by piece before determining this) it may be time to shop for a new pump.  It may be expensive, but it's an investment in your future milk supply and sounds like it's also important that you finish pumping quickly at work.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No woman has breasts that are exactly the same, but it is entirely possible that one breast needs a different sized breastshield than the other.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/lopsided.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  Is this a problem?<br>  <br>  Most women notice differences in milk supply, pumping output, milk flow and/or size between breasts. As with many other things (foot size, ring size, eyesight, etc.) asymmetry is normal in humans. In some women the difference between breasts is hardly noticeable; in others it is very noticeable. There is every variation in between. This is not usually a problem in terms of the breastfeeding relationship, so you certainly don't need to do anything about it if the asymmetry does not bother you or baby; however some mothers prefer to even things out, particularly if there is a very noticable difference in breast size.<br>  <br>  Sometimes babies will refuse or fuss at a breast when the let-down is slower or too forceful, or the supply a bit lower. They in turn will prefer the side which lets down more/less quickly and in which the supply is more bountiful. <br>  <br>  ------------<br>  Choosing a Correctly-Fitted Breastshield<br>  <a href="http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/tips-and-solutions/13/choosing-a-correctly-fitted-breastshield" rel="nofollow">http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/tip...</a>|`|deIzFnV8aa	You can have different let down in your different sides, and also the pump can stimulate the milk ducts slightly differently in the two sides. When I pump I always have a much easier time getting milk out of the right side.  Somethings that help me a bit are switching back and forth between breasts (I only have a one sided pump), starting with the slower one, and also using warm compresses on that breast.|`|yw7AeZn2aa	I think that is nornal.  just like one breast usually produces more milk... Im on my 2nd child and that is still the case.  I know to get the supply even you should pump longer etc on the weaker side, but I don't know about slower let down.... breasts don't work exactly alike unfortunately!!  <br>  <br>  Go to laleche.org - they have lactation consultants that you can call and ask questions.  Good luck!|`|EgHy7rdFaa	perhaps your husband drains the left one when you are sleeping, you never know, get a little camera in the room
D0oqTblpaa	More than likely it's your period.  The spotting on the 27th could have been from an irritant (like intercourse) or flux in your body's hormones.  A lot of women don't have implantation bleeding.   <br>  <br>  If it's been a year it might be time to consult your doctor.  Or maybe take a ttc break and relax, enjoy each other and have fun off the schedule. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|XyQgoSk1aa	sometimes be4 a period you can spot brown this indicates old blood. But also it depends on your "period" was it normal? how many days did it last? there are many question i can ask you. But if you still feel like you may be pregnant take a test it will give you the answers.
D0oqTblpaa	That sounds about right.  I have PCOS (policystic ovaries syndrome) and it's hard for the eggs to break out of the cysts.  When they do some fluid is released into my abdomen and that's what causes the pain.<br>  <br>  Last time I was laid out for an afternoon.  It's kind of counterproductive but luckily I get the nookie before the ovulation.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Millions of women experience it, it's called mittelschmerz - totally normal and very common.|`|8RfmosODaa	Yea I think I have experinced some pain with ovualtion but I tend to get crampy.|`|TanYOqqfaa	yer I get that first pain you mentioned.I sometimes get a gas/air bubbly feeling the next day after sex,it's wierd and I don't know what that is?|`|6L9jJnchaa	I get that pinching in my side for a day, but not the other pain...that might have just been another type of cramp, or you pulled something.|`|CFFuFof1aa	It sounds like ovulation pain. Was it accompanied by some whitish discharge? That would be ovulating.|`|GJNNr7Qeaa	im transgender...and my new little coochie woochie is always hurting...but i really dont know if it's because of ovulation pains...i just think it's cause the doctor cut my dicky wicky off wrong!!!...i really hope i helped u solve your problem.|`|ps1U1pkhaa	omg, this happened to me for the 1st time this month..<br>  im only 14, but i've had my period for a year..<br>  i know what you're going through.<br>  but i have no clue what it is!<br>  hope it gets better!
rDsKB0uXaa	You can come forward don't worry with family and friends by your side , your ex / boyfriend is a dumb ASSS and doesn't deserve you<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|256cVXsmaa	Oh my god I am going through the exact same thing.  If you feel like you can't abort than by all means DO NOT ABORT.  You will regret it forever.  He has no say in what you do, he's an idiot just like my boyfriend lol.  Me and my boyfriend were dating for 4 years and exactly like you said, I thought he would stick around and I thought for sure I could trust him to love our baby.  He basically said the same exact things as your boyfriend did. I thought as time went on he would get used to the idea and come around, after all he "loves me so much and would do anything for me", so I thought for sure he would love OUR baby once he felt it kick and move about.  I'm 24 weeks and he still hasn't wanted to feel the movements or talk about the baby at all for that matter.  If a guy is reluctant from the start then they will probably push all thoughts of the baby out of their head throughout the whole pregnancy, things will not get better with him.  They obviously are way to immature to handle the thought of new responsibilities.  I mean it's absolutely sickening, he had sex with you and thought that he was mature enough to do that but now that you have a child in you he can't stick by you through it.  SO IMMATURE.  I am telling you if you keep that child in you it is only going to get harder as time goes on.  Now that i'm farther along I find my hormones going insane and some days I feel like I cant even take it.  The stress of the guy not caring will really weigh down on you and your emotions.  He will do WHATEVER he wants while you are sitting at home trying to keep that baby healthy.  It's going to be so hard but if you love that baby you need to keep it and keep it healthy.  It's hard but I am getting through it as will you.  No matter what anyone says he probably will be a complete *** throughout the whole pregnancy, you just have to be strong enough to block him out of your head.  The stress can be to hard to handle at times and you can only imagine what that is doing to your baby.  <br>  As time goes on you can start to consider the other option of adoption.  Your decision will change about 500 times depending on the mood your in.  Some days i think it's best to give my baby to a stable home, some days I think how the hell can I give MY baby away?! By the end you will do what is right for YOU.  I am just taking it day by day... I'm sure I will no what is best for me and my baby soon. <br>  I wish you the best of luck.<br>  If you ever want to talk about it you can email me... were going through the same stuff.|`|ztzEloj5aa	raise your baby by yourself- take him for child support and be done with it. you can do it- there are thousands of single moms out there|`|FEceIxKbaa	Raise your baby with friends and family. You dont need him. You are strong and can do way better.<br>  <br>  Your baby would have a more happier life without a dumba.s.s father who didnt even want him\or in the beginning. <br>  <br>  There are many single mothers who love their babies and are doing amazing at rasing their children by their selves. You can be one of them and still be on top of the world.<br>  <br>  Good Luck darling. I wish you the best in life.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Speaking as someone who pretty much grew up without a father, I can positively say that I turned out fairly normal and well-adjusted.<br>  <br>  He's being a selfish jerk, so I personally recommend telling him that you will absolutely not get an abortion. You don't want one, and he obviously doesn't respect that opinion, so I would just go your separate ways.<br>  <br>  There is also the possibility of you marrying later down the line. My husband's mother divorced her alcoholic husband and later met and married the man that my husband has known as his father for most of his life. My husband loves him even though biologically they aren't related, and he had a great upbringing--self-described by him as "wonderful" and "practically problem-free."<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your baby, go for it. Being alive without a father is better than being dead any day of the week.|`|xnhwmontaa	You don't need a father to raise a child. Plenty of children are raised without one because the dads are dead beats. This is not an excuse to murder your child. Abortion is wrong and your killing him or her because why? no father? I would rather have life than not have a father. Who cares you don't need him. Go on with your life and leave the sperm donor in the past you have the best part of him.|`|4yoNpi6Raa	owned hard!|`|a884HghJaa	Girl...we are no longer in the olden days.  Today's generation is changing and independent mothers are raising children all the time.  You sound like a sweet girl, that fell in love with an irresponsible boy.  It could be a phase because he is still in shock.  Men and women take the knowledge of a new baby very different. You have the emotions and feelings, he has the visions of a future that may not fit into his already set future plans.  Just know that all your dreams of seeing your baby grow is more than just a dream.  You have to stay positive, if daddy doesn't come back around, trust me you sound like you have the drive to make a good life for your baby.  Just as an FYI, if you ask your OB, Im sure they can put you in contact with local aids to help you with baby, God Bless you both!|`|xqqYXUNHaa	To be honest that will be the solution for many of us, but we as women make the greatest choices in life, which is life itself...

Your baby has a heartbeat already ... I had my first transvaginal ultrasound done tuesday and at the time I was 6 weeks and 2 days prgenant and I already heard my baby's heartbeat... :) Think about it ...

xnhwmontaa	When I had my second daughter by scheduled c section. My husband went home and got my daughter who was 18 months and my dad after I was out of surgery By the time he got back I was in my room and the baby was done with all the checks after birth. That way we could spend time together without being moved to another room. or them having to take the baby to the nursery to be checked out and all the things they do to a baby right after birth. She didn't miss anything. I think if she had been there the whole time she would have been cranky for waiting. Good Luck|`|CFFuFof1aa	No, I wouldn't have him at the hospital during. I remember (I was 5) when my brother was born, my mom was crying and I was so upset and didn't know what was happening. All kids will be scared to see there mommy in a hospital bed. I would wait until the next day, when you feel a little better and you will be able to move around and interact with him. When I had my daughter, we waited until the next day to bring my stepson up to the hospital and he stayed about 2 hours. He was 3. Good luck, and congrats!!!!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	I had a vaginal birth around 7 in the morning.That afternoon my husband brought our 3 year old in to see me.He was ok for awhile.Eventually my nerves got the better of me and I had to have my son leave.He was very excited and loved his brother it was harder on me than him.The next day I was fine with him there.You could let your son come but have someone who is in charge of him and can leave when you or your 3 year old is getting antsy.|`|ZAppRn5Faa	well i dont personally have much experience sense i'm only 13 but i was 2 1/2 when my brother was born and i was brought to my grandparents then my parents went to the hospital he was born and i went to the hospital soon after and i fed him his first bottle and idk it was cutee haha but that depends if you live around family members. hope i could help (: hope everything goes well|`|oXEEMAL0aa	i had 4 scheduled c-sections and with my last my son had just turned 4, i left him with family because although i wanted him to be a part of the experience because he was pregnant with me he even had doctors check his belly to make sure his baby was growing and healthy i felt that a major surgery like that and a hospital was no place for a child until i was in my room where i could share our baby with him.<br>  Anything can go wrong in a surgery no matter how routine it is and your son should be with a close friend or family member until you are in your room.  Keep in mind if you have never had a c-section before how drained physically you are after surgery.  You may not feel up to having company.

You won't be able to see him for about 30-40 minutes, but unless you are being totally put under you will be okay to be around him as long as someone is there to tend to him.  He needs to see that you are okay, too.  He does not have to stay the whole day, but I would definitely reccomend him being there at the time of birth:)|`|8RfmosODaa	You could have him there before and let someone take him for lunch while you are having your c-section adn getting everything finished up then have him back in afterwords.

She skips school contantly, and just monday she got hit by a car as a result from skipping. Another girl I knew last year in 7th grade got pregnant and the day before her baby was born her baby's dad got shot and died. So she's a single TEENAGE parent at 14.

Frankly, I think all this talk about stupidity and parents not watching their kids is ridiculous. Also, what constitutes a "teen," in your opinion? Under 18? Because I am sick and tired of people referring to people who are old enough to vote as "kids." (I know plenty of people who call 20 + adults "children," and THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is stupid.)<br>  <br>  This whole idea of teenagers getting pregnant... its NOT a new phenomenon. In fact, the idea of it being a bad thing is a product of the modern, technological world! <br>  <br>  I agree that some teenagers probably should have been more careful. But just the same, others were beyond careful and still managed to get pregnant. And I agree that some teenagers make horrible parents. And yet again, on the other side... I know plenty of teens who make brilliant parents, and so called "adults" (meaning, 30 or above) who make terrible, prison-worthy parents. <br>  <br>  So stop judging an entire section of people, namely the "teens." Judge yourself only. What are YOUR reasons for getting pregnant? What are YOUR consequences? What should YOU be doing?|`|byQDwPv8aa	This 'kind of stuff' has been going on for years and is only just reachig spotlight fame because of cases like Alfie Patten, the 13 year old.

I am going to be 19 when my partner and I have our first baby and we didn't plan it that way. I was using the pill and a condom.

I would guess this is going to be the hardest decision she will probably ever make, and regardless of her choice its better for her and you if you can keep your strength together. It would be hard to give up your children and lose your mother in the process. But if she really wants to do this, I think that with her having to find a home to take all three, don't split them up. Also really spend time with the candiates, get to know them so you know your grandchildren are safe, loved and cared for. There are alot of people out there that want children but can't have them and they would be wonderful parents, also there are alot out there that thank god will never have children. Just really search their background as I said they will be caring for your grandchildren. I hope this has helped and I wish you and your daughter all the luck no matter what you and her decide.|`|Sg1h0ecpaa	You should make sure that they're going to raise the babies in a way that you would want to be raised - ask their views on discipline, education, and other things that strike you as important. If I were in your shoes, I would make a list of the things that are most important to me about raising children - the things that you think are essential to give to a child and ensure that they have (whether it is material goods or a good education). Pick the couple whose ideals are in line with yours. I hope that your daughter's pregnancy goes smoothly. I think it's great that you're standing by her. Good luck to you.|`|byQDwPv8aa	You should look for some one who has a stable relationship, residence and income. Consider getting police clearances etc etc|`|guLZMT7naa	I respect that you guys are putting the babies up for adoption and not just aborting them to take the easy way out. Having three babies would be an amazing thing. My husband and I are hoping to adopt someday when we find a family willing to let us adopt through a private adoption. But, we haven't found them yet. But, I would look for a Christian home, one who love children, has a good background, don't seem off to you(like crazy or just weird), no drugs, no drinking. Just a nice home, with loving parents who can take care of them and raise them properly. Oh and you would want a stay at home mom. I love being one and with three you would want that.

No chance at all.<br>  <br>  No sex in 6 months.<br>  <br>  Have you had sex?<br>  have you missed any pills?<br>  If you have sex, and or miss a pill, then you can be pregnant. Although with the pill, your cycle could be off....<br>  (although occasionally some people say they do not miss pills and still get pregnant..)
CD1Ps2A1aa	the only thing i know, is that you are stuck with a c-section because once you have one you have to have another one if you get pregnant again. also i think you are doing everything fine, however i dont know the chances or percentage of if it will be premature or not.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Guess what you can do everything right during pregnancy and something could go wrong it's just nature and that's how it works. Don't stress so much I'm sure everything is fine the very worst thing you can do is worry.|`|m2aznd8xaa	im sure you will be fine. you sound like a normal mommy with very common concerns . it depends what the dr suggests for you for your labor. i had an emergancy c section with my now 9 yr old daughter . i dialated only 7 cm was in labor 3 days and  she got stuck in my pelvic bone. and with my now 21 month old daughter my dr recommended i do a repeat c section since i had such a hard time the first time.  if dr okays it you can have  regular birth as long as it was a horizontal cut. be sure to discuss it with your dr.  you are doing great just relax dont stress yourself out and enjoy your pregnancy. keep taking those prenatals and keep up with the appointments. congrats|`|uin3ffWDaa	stop worrying, anxiety is bad for the baby.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	You're doing everything fine, although stopping abruptly can be stressful to yoru system and add stress to your moods!<br>  <br>  Don't stress about having a miscarriage. Try to focus on the positives and dont let all these fears overwhelm you.<br>  <br>  Some doctors will do a VBAC, you may need to have another c-section. <br>  <br>  You can talk to your doctor about the chances of your baby being premature, it would really depend on your health, what causes the first premature birth, and the health of the baby. <br>  <br>  Congrats and enjoy being pregnant :) Don't worry so much!|`|t46lboAMaa	First of all everyone has some concern like that during their pregnancy. It is normal to be a little concerned. Just don't flip out. If you stress out during your pregnancy you are way more likely to have a problem. Try to focus on other things whether it is planning the babies new environment or a job outside the home find something you can do to keep from worrying. Keep your mind busy with other things.<br>  As for whether you will have a c-section or not that would be a question for the Dr. He has your medical history. I have been told various things about how they determine if you need a c-section, but only your Dr who examines you can say what is best. <br>  Good luck|`|xPfJG3FGaa	i think everybody thats happy about being pregnant worries about a miscarriage, but what's meant to be will be, you say your doing everything right, that's good, but it really doesn't make a difference, trust me, i know crackheads that smoked crack their pregnancy, even people who shot up dope their whole pregnancy, and had their babies, then i know people that did everything "right" and weren't as lucky, basically what i'm trying to say is all u can do, is let go and let god! I'm 40 weeks on tuesday, and not proud to say i smoked my whole pregnancy, i drink soda every single day, and i eat whatever i want to eat, and so far my baby is as healthy as can be, so don't worry and stress yourself out, if it's meant to be it will be!|`|EdhOYaW9aa	a c section i think is only for a baby that's feet is towards the ... ( bad word ) because they wont be able to take it out with the legs only by the head =P|`|y5sWmbtnaa	You are doing everything right and you will be fine .. Good luck and congratulations...<br>  <br>  C section is likely since you had one before, I have heard hospitals are only allowed a certain ammount of VBACS<br>  (i learned in Child birth prep course)|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Stop worrying!! A VBAC is your choice but if complications arise you might need a c-section. Remember every pregnancy is different. Good luck.|`|ROIMWQlVaa	pray <br>  prepare to accept the worst <br>  keep busy<br>  don't fuss about trifles<br>  don't worry about the past<br>  count your blessing not your troubles<br>  create happiness for others|`|M21c8MQ9aa	I am an obstetrician so my answer can be trusted. If you had your first baby at 29 weeks, your second child is at greater risk of being born premature. I'm not saying that there is a 100% chances of your second child being born premature, but the risk is somewhat high. If you are seeing the same obstetrician that you did when you were pregnant with Tristan, chances are your obstetrician will put you on bedrest later on in pregnancy just to be safe. <br>  Now days, if a woman has a C-section with her first child, then that is the delivery method for all of her children|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I think personally that you'll be just fine.  But if you decide to have another child, if you want to quit the smoking, and drinking drinks with caffeine, it's better to do that months before you get pregnant.  And also, to take prenatal vitamins as soon as you are trying to get pregnant too, then your body is all together more prepared.  But really, you did quit smoking, and drinking caffeine (which isn't a super huge deal anyway as long as you're only drinking one or two a day-and it's better to gradually quit doing both of these-smoking and caffeine-sometimes it can do more damage than good if done all at once.  It's like a shock to the system)  But if you're doing just fine so far, I think you're going to do just fine...don't worry too much about it, and talk to your doctor about it too, that will help to ease your mind.  And since you had a premature baby before, they will definitely monitor you closely to make sure everything is okay this time around.  And this baby doesn't have to be a c-section if you don't want it to be unless for medical reasons.  Another one to talk to your doctor about.  Good luck and I wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy!
4VIjILk1aa	Anytime you have unprotected sex you have a great chance on being pregnant. Wait 2 weeks to take a test.|`|axaD1D0Caa	Well lets not forget Feb was a shorter month... but if you are pregnant i think it will be from another time|`|BrvrqPTnaa	well heres what i learned from health class.<br>  <br>  If you get your period usually around the 1st, and you had intercourse on the 2nd, it usually takes 5 days for a period to end. Ovulatoin occurs around 14 days after you start menstruating, so you may or may not be. You decided to have sex at a very wierd time.
kaqPSgTVaa	As long as you aren't inhaling it you should be fine. For your peace of mind call and ask your doctor. That is the type of thing he's there for. Questions.|`|iwYu32N2aa	well i guess you should have asked your dentist what it could do to you being pregnant. Id bring it up with your OB at your next appt to be sure everything is fine.
b5dKxVMiaa	Oh I remember those days I know how you feel. Nothing really did work for my baby. I would have to stay up until 2-3am trying to calm her. I would fall asleep in the rocker with her in my arms after she finally would calm down. Sometimes I tried the bouncer in front of the tv with the volume off. She seemed to like the lights. If she is latching on to your breast well then I would go ahead a give her a pacifier. I did not want to give my baby a pacifier either, but it was and still is the only thing that would calm her sometimes. I do not think it is necessary for you to wait a month to give it to her (if latching well). But I would understand if you want to wait, but it could help. I had to walk the floors for a good month and 1/2 to sooth my crying baby. It worked some nights, but killed my back. :) <br>  Do you feel heavy or engorged before she eats and then empty after? If so then I would think she is getting enough to drink. Her little nervous system will get in check soon. Mine stopped the crying at 8 weeks and sleeps pretty well through the night. If it doesn't stop call the dr. Good luck!|`|h4ste2pEaa	In the worst case,,,, maybe your milk is not in ALL THE WAY. Yes maybe its in but not enough to keep her awake and satisty her. Try  your best to keep her awake and fill that belly up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|SAJitWLfaa	Are you sure you're producing enough milk? Is she sleeping all day? And does she get held all day?|`|AOvtRBU9aa	This worked for me and my husband. We took her to bed with us and I nursed to sleep, that was the only way I can get any sleep. I needed sleep because I work full time. I'm sure there will be lots of people who will disagree with co-sleeping but I do what's best for us. You shouldn't let her cry it out. Your baby is crying for a reason and you need to get to the bottom of it. I usually start with diaper, nursing, burping and cuddling. <br>  <br>  ETA sometimes a baby like to comfort nurse so it doesn't necessary mean she is hungry. She just wants to suck.|`|Zpi3Tmb9aa	I had the same problem with my son. I realized it was because he wasn't getting enough from my breast. He would suck and it was so hard to get anything out. I suggest you pump to make sure that you are producing enough. I think that once she gets enough to fill her belly she will sleep longer. I actually had to switch to formula because even with the pump I couldn't get enough. Hopefully with the pump ( if you decide to try that) it will work for you and she can continue to get breast milk.|`|qj9bzxN2aa	sounds like you are way overstimulating her... you should change the diaper first, than feed and while you burp her, you can soothe her back to sleep by singing to her.  Also, get a "womb sounds bear" turn it on while you are feeding her and cuddling and keep it on when you lay her down.  She shouldnt be sleeping in a room all alone yet.  I highly recommend getting a bassinet or a co-sleeper (Arm's Reach co-sleeper is the best). This way she can still smell you and if she wakes up you have easy access to her.  Hope this helps!|`|rxeGMKnbaa	Try the video "The Happiest Baby on the Block" it has lots of great ways to soothe babies. It also suggests undressing the baby a little (so it's not as cozy) while you are feeding so that they are not as likely to drift back to sleep.|`|cI1JShJNaa	I learned that the length of breast feeding does not necessarily mean they are actually getting enough to eat. Are you sure your baby is eating the whole 20-30 min? A good indication is swallowing...if shes not doing it the whole time then she is not getting enough. I dont know if your up to this but you can try giving her 1oz of formula when she starts crying. Formula will actually fill babies up more than breastmilk...breastmilk just goes right through them thats why breastfed babies eat more than formula babies. Anyway you can try it if not just try breastfeeding her all the time. you can also try sleeping with her on your bed then moving her when shes deep asleep.
Fd4lITkvaa	I went with swaddling. My son resisted too but he needed it to sleep well. They do grow out of the need, you will need to wean them of the habit though. They have a startle reflex that they grow out of between 4-6 months old, that's why they need to be swaddled and find it comforting. To stop swaddling my son I started leaving one arm free. After a few weeks I stopped swaddling all together. The first night or two without was hard but he got over it and did fine since he didn't physically need it anymore. I think he was around 5 months old.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003293.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...</a>|`|n6XYYyoLaa	try a 'swaddle me' wrap by kiddopotamus; ten bucks at brus; dd cried going in , but once she was snug, she was a happy camper, put the passy in and she was out.... i credit them with her having always slept through the night....we had two and used them everynight and the still look new....gl , hth|`|rFtKFp03aa	My babies hated being swaddled ... and they hated not being swaddled... <br>  <br>  basically they enjoyed the outcome but hated the idea of it.. they were happy the second they were completely swaddled... <br>  <br>  silly babies|`|qfSKgxDsaa	She'll grow out and be fine just like every other baby, but typically babies want to be swaddled because they feel close like they were in the womb...but all babies are different see which one works best|`|01vMpHkWaa	my son hates being swaddled now. he didnt mind it a few days ago but how when i go to swaddle him he gets upset<br>  hes 4 days old<br>  <br>  if think if she doesnt want to be swaddled then dont do it. baby knows what baby likes|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Swaddling is great.  You know your daughter better than your pediatrician so if you think she needs it in order to sleep then let her be swaddled!!  My son is 7 1/2 months old and we JUST stopped swaddling him for bed.  He doesn't want it anymore.  But that was the ONLY way he would sleep.   It really was the key to him being such a good sleeper.  Your daughter won't always need to be swaddled.  She will let you know when she doesn't want it anymore.  My cousin swaddled his son until he was a yr old.  My son also struggled to get out but he would fall asleep after the struggle all the time.|`|TlFnIei0aa	My doctor also said to swaddle my daughter becauseshe will startle herself away, but she hates it, when I do she screams until sh gets her arms free and she has done since she wsa about 3 days old.<br>  I don't swaddle her because it's easieer to put her back to sleep if she starles herself awak than if she gets really worked up trying to get her arms out.<br>  Now she is 4 weeks old and she still startles but she's used to it and doesn't wake up very often.|`|cI1JShJNaa	my baby hates to be swaddled! lol...he likes his arms out and this we found has caused some problems cause he'll fling his arms around when hes asleep and that will wake him up, but he will not sleep swaddled. anyway...i have come to think it depends on the personality of the child. dont worry about her getting used to it...the worse that can happen is that she will just need a blanket to sleep with when she ready to go to sleep or take a nap.|`|632bfd06f390ec1dd33582c79c234803aa	How old is your baby?  My 3rd didn't take to it so much, he always wiggled his way out.  Remember its to comfort them, so if she isn't comforted then don't do it.  Take cues from her, maybe she just want for you to hold her.  I have never heard of a baby not growing out of swaddling..Good luck and congrats.|`|elx4NP4xaa	I swaddled my daughter at first but now she is 2 months and she likes to be free, she loves to stretch out her arms and legs. She goes to bed perfectly fine under her covers.|`|IC4A6ZHbaa	every baby is different do what works for you.

Braxton hicks are to ready your uterus for actual labor. if they because between 5-7 minutes away its time to visit a hospital. just cause you have braxton hicks does not mean your going into labor in a couple hours. although, you could go into labor in a few hours, days, and even weeks. they don't tell you exactly. i which one of these damn pregnancy symptoms would tell you exactly when you would go into labor too. congrats. and your almost their.|`|xLNl0f14aa	well as my ob told me ..Braxton hicks contractions are like the conditiong to your labor..lol.im a sports fan so he phrased it that way. 8) they mean ur body is getting prepared for the big day..ive been having them since i was in my early second trimester with this one who happens to be my second child. If they start becoming more intense or more frequent then call ur ob. Braxton hicks contractions in no way determine how close u r to delivering unfortunately. but at least ur body is helping to prepare u..i didnt having any with my first that i noticed anyways.. they say if u have so many in an hr though that u do need to call ur ob or go to labor and delivery just in case but that all depends on ur ob or midwife so i would definitely talk to ur ob about his or her protocol on that. 8)|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I predict you will have your baby in 2 to 7 weeks LOL<br>  I am 35 weeks also. Braxton Hicks started at 24 weeks for me though.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	ugh....who knows...it could be anytime....i'm 36 weeks, and i'm so miserable|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	When having braxton hicks they are there to help prepare you for the real thing. but some people get them starting at 20 weeks.. you can go into labor at any times..
ioJ7XDqGaa	When I weaned my babies I would massage my breasts and express a little each time. Just enough to relieve the discomfort.<br>  If you do it with your hands and not a pump the milk will slow down more quickly. also if you start at 1 to 2 ounces on each side then reduce each day it should only take about a week or so.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	if the child wants to nurse, and you are producing milk... whats the problem??|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Have you concidered weaning your baby.  thats what i did both times and i never got engorged, your supply will slow down naturally and it will be easier on the both of you.   You could also pump a little when you are in pain if you really want to stop.  It will take a little longer but at least you wont be in so much pain.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	you can try and switch to formula if they are still young enough, you can get medicine from your doctor that helps dry you up.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	massage your breasts, it will dry up but it it will be painful

NOjcTeT4aa	You're pretty .... you would look nice with a small stud.|`|HLKb961Qaa	I think it would look really cute! Get something classy like a small diamond stud. You do have to be 18 in most states to get one unless you have an adult with you, since it's not like getting your ears pierced. Usually it's done at a piercing and tattoo place, most of which by law don't allow someone under 18 without an accompanying adult. Good luck! (BTW, I heard it hurts a LOT!)|`|7nOkNtw4aa	You would look good with a tiny stud, Nothing big and flashy tho.<br>  Another piercing i think that would look good on you is maybe an eyebrow ring?<br>  <br>  If you do get your nose pierced take good care of it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|XrKviWgSaa	i don't think you would look good with your nose pierced as a lot of people that get them done don't look good with them. and you have a really nice face so why get it pierced?|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Ya, you'll look great with a stud!! Maybe a little diamond, totally!|`|gaGeR55maa	my advice is get it done ... if you really dont like the way it looks than you can always take it out!|`|daza5A4vaa	Yep, you'd look super cute (:|`|kRaVa0Wraa	you would look really good :) like a small diamond stud.<br>  plus if you really hate it you can just take it out and it will heal. Youre really pretty :)|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yeah you would look nice with a small stud on the nose. how about u take a small rhinestone or a glitter and place it on your nose see how you look...pls just don't get no big bull piercing on your nose..lol|`|nZVmkZSBaa	You would look really good with a nose STUD, not a ring. That's just plain gross. :)|`|MrNkNnhyaa	yea,you would look good with a nose piercing,but just get a small stud at first and see if you like it..:]]|`|0DtWgXxUaa	a stud would look fine.

deIzFnV8aa	You can get patterns at any craft store, but JoAnn Fabrics will have many more, since it is a dedicated fabric store.  It also has teh widest variety of fabrics, though some Walmarts and Targets also have a fabric section which can be less inexpensieve. However, JoAnns has a lot of things on sale at any given time, and it is certainly where I would start.<br>  <br>  Many patterns for baby clothing are also available free online (do a google search).  Using an online pattern will be slightly harder, since you may have to make measurements yourself (most patterns you buy are paper that you cut out and trace onto the fabric.<br>  <br>  It will help a lot if you have access to a sewing machine and someone to help you use one.  Much faster than hand stitiching, though you can do that as well.  A pattern will tell you how much fabric to buy.  You will also need matching thread and pins to holding fabric together, at a bare minimum.<br>  <br>  Dresses are nice in that they don't have to fit very precisiely to look good, so it is a great project for a beginner.  Most patterns have a difficulty rating - look for one that is easy if you are a beginning sewer.  They will probably have easier ways of doing clasps and such - buttonholes and zippers are both pretty hard.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Charity shops often have old dress patterns very cheap, and many of these may be children's patterns.<br>  There will be books in the Public Library on making your own children's clothes.   Embroidery may be involved, expecially for little girls' dresses using smocking.

MeYILJeSaa	Yes, it's true. By microwaving it, it "zaps" out all the nutrients. You should just either put it the bag under warm tap water or fill a big bowl with warm water and let it sit.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	Microwaving destroys some of the anti-infective properties of the breast milk and may create "hot spots" that could burn your baby. Place the container of milk in a bowl of warm water, or place under the hot water faucet, and heat to room temperature. Your baby may refuse milk straight from the refrigerator, but cold milk is not harmful|`|Mxe36NZEaa	Well regular milk is from a cow's breast, and you can microwave that, I don't see why you couldn't in this situation.|`|GINmkQMfaa	yes|`|IDmaxViIaa	No you can heat breast milk. But it is already warm when is comes out of the breast so you normally only heat it when your using a pump to get the breast mik out.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well.|`|xrEIAD2aaa	No you shouldn't micro it.  It breaks down the good molecules or something like that.  I always heated mine on the stove in the bottle. Just put the bottle in a pan of boiling water till it's warm. You could also run it under hot water. It thaws out pretty quickly.|`|3y0jPzgSaa	you can heat it up..but heating up milk for babies in a microwave is bad because it leaves hot and cold spots...so when the baby is drinking it, he or she can burn at times...thats why it's good to heat it up in a pot with hot water in it...that way, you get an even distribution of heat and the baby wont burn|`|lxJoXNZwaa	You should just give it straight from the breast -- it's best.  If you freeze your breastmilk just reheat it by letting sit in hot water.

You can heat up water in the microwave, though, and put the milk in the water after it's out of the microwave.|`|TVzA5WE8aa	I would not suggest to microwave breast milk for the babies. High temperature or air exposure can instantly kill the nutrients that are present in the milk.|`|51uHFwX9aa	I was told that it kills all the nutrients and good stuff that the baby really needs. I've always just ran it under pretty hot water.|`|f4sKk8Ytaa	true.<br>  breastmilk holds a lot of vitamins/proteins needed from your baby growth. heating it up "distroys" most of them. <br>  if you want it a little warm, take a pot or boiler and put your breastmilk container in it. this is a natural way of heating.|`|wLzcj73gaa	<a href="http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can, but you shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Nor should you use it to heat up formula.<br>  <br>  Heating in the microwave damages the protein structure of breastmilk or formula.  It also creates hot spots, and while mixing thoroughly will stop the baby from being burned by these hot spots the hot spots will destroy the nutrients in them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/328872/why_you_cant_microwave_breastmilk.html?cat=52" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  "Often the reason given is that the milk will have hot spots that scald the baby, but being a liquid, a quick shake would eliminate that danger, and a mother would shake the thawed milk anyways because the fat separates from the thin milk. Hot spots do not appear to be the true reason for avoiding the microwave."<br>  <br>  During my research I saw over and over again that breastmilk can not be heated in the microwave. I just didn't know why microwaving for formula worked and breastmilk did not. The number one reason not to microwave breastmilk is that, according to kidsgrowth.com, "Microwaving breastmilk can change the milk's composition."<br>  <br>  Studies have shown that "there is a substantial loss of the anti-infective properties of breast milk when it is microwaved to a temperature between 72 [degree] -98 [degree] C, a temperature easily reached in most microwave ovens. Even at lower temperatures (20 [degree] -53 [degree] C) the anti-infective action is a significantly lessened."<br>  <br>  It has been found that, "Microwaving breastmilk, or heating it on the stove, can cause a loss of Vitamin C content, along with loss of some of the milk's special anti-infective properties. The higher the temperature, the more pronounced the effect."1<br>  <br>  It is important to note that the above statement included heating milk on the stove as another no-no. We often think that microwaving is the only thing you can't do with breastmilk. However, heating breastmilk on the stove has the potential to spike the tempature to a point where vitamin and mineral loss is likely to happen.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T026900.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T026900...</a><br>  Do not heat expressed human milk in a microwave oven. Even if the overall temperature of the milk stays below body temperature, there may be "hot spots" where the milk is overheated and some of its beneficial properties are destroyed. The uneven heating can also be dangerous when the bottle is given to baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babies.sutterhealth.org/breastfeeding/bf_expressing_storing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babies.sutterhealth.org/breas...</a><br>  Thaw breast milk at room temperature or in a bowl of hot tap water. Defrost using the least amount of heat possible. NEVER MICROWAVE BREAST MILK, as it may create hot spots and destroy some beneficial vitamins and enzymes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/shakenot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/s...</a><br>  Don't Shake the Milk<br>  <br>  Linda J. Smith, BSE, FACCE, IBCLC<br>  <br>  Why not?<br>  <br>  Because shaking expressed mothers' milk (or boiling or freezing it) denatures the shaped molecules of the protective proteins, leaving only the pieces - the amino acids - the parts. Lactoferrin, lysozyme, and other protective components work their protection magic when they are in their original shaped molecular structure. Some components remain intact, even during freezing, shaking or heating. They not only protect the gut from many kinds of infection, but also prevent inflammation of the gut lining. Even broken up, the separate amino acids are still really good stuff and are digested by the baby as nutrients.<br>  <br>  Imagine a set of pop-beads assembled into a necklace or bracelet. When the beads are acting as a bracelet or necklace, they are doing their job as protective elements. When you break apart the beads, you have in your hand many individual chunks of amino acids which are then digested.<br>  <br>  Cellular components are also susceptible to damage by physical stress. After all, they are living cells.<br>  <br>  With mother's milk, you get at least two functions for the price of one. With manufactured formula, you only get the individual beads, never the necklace or bracelet. And never the living cells.<br>  <br>  So, please handle human milk gently, respectfully and kindly. It's far more than perfect food for babies - it's a living tissue and protective shield too.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I heard its because of heating up so quickly there will be little heat pockets in it that could burn the babies mouth.
s4LWmcTjaa	I simply said "Gabby, your kids don't need blackened lungs" and that honestly was enough for me.<br>  <br>  Now I did back slide when I had a miscarriage and I smoked for about 3 months again, but never around my son who was 11 months old at the time.  Always outside and I changed clothes and washed my hands afterwards.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I just remembered how hard it was to quit originally.  And, felt a bit of pride in myself for having done so.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i smoked before i became pregnant, only briefly though. i obviously quit as soon as i found out that i was pregnant. when i've gotten really stressed out i really want a cigarette and it's hard for me to stay away, but i do. i don't want to start back up when i have my baby...but i can just see myself reaching for a cig and running outside. so we will see, i really hope though, that i can STAY AWAY! for the sake of my health and my baby's.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I remind myself how hard it was to quit, how expensive the habit is, how much cigarette smoke stinks, and most importantly- the ill health effects of smoking.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I quit 2 years before I got pregnant. Does that count? I just don't crave it,  or want it. (Besides the whole, baby has asthma, can't smoke anyway deal)|`|vKYdV5r2aa	I never quit BUT i don''''t smoke in the house or around my kids ....|`|AA12145826	I'll be honest, I had no problem quitting when I was pregnant and staying away when I was nursing, but once I stopped breastfeeding I fell back into smoking (I could tell you that I only smoked at work, but that doesn't make it any less terrible...I know). What helped me quit for good about 2 years after starting again was getting a nasty case of gastroenteritis. Trust me, after 4 days of puking & other nasty stuff, the last thing on my mind was smoking. In my opinion, the hardest days of quitting are the first 2 or 3, so I knew that if I could get past those, then I was in the clear as far as totally breaking my mind of the habit. That was Christmas 2005 and I haven't had the urge to smoke since. It helped that I began working for a company with a no smoking policy in 2007 so I have extra incentive not to start back up.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	The last thing you want is for your child to think that it is okay to smoke, and if you continue to do it, it is almost like a welcome sign for them to do it as well.  I kept telling myself that I would NEVER EVER smoke in front of him, because I do not want him to do it.  The same rule applies to lots of things.<br>  <br>  Also, with a new baby you would have to wash your hands so much that your skin would start falling off.  Also, do not let anyone around him who smokes- make them wash their hands, even change their shirts before holding him.  The reason- if you put all of these restrictions on smoking and the baby- you won't want to deal with the hassle of having a cigarette.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bfb11971727754a95133b1695dcf3badaa	I just got out of the habit of it while I was pregnant & then breastfed & you can't really leave them alone for quite some time without them crying after you so when it came to the time where I could start again it wasn't part of the routine anymore. & the thought of all the money we were saving! New clothes beat nicotine hands down.|`|L1XVydDxaa	I quit but when baby came i started smoking again its really hard not to when everybody around u is but i don't smoke around my baby and i don't let anyone else either. i dont know what else to tell u unless u have very good self-control|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I quit the day I found out I was pregnant...I took the test and smoked my last cigarette before I looked at the results, after that I stopped.

My husband still smokes-only outside- but I still had no real desire.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	After he was born, I didn't go back on them because I wanted to breastfeed. That was will power enough for me. But I went back on them when I finished breastfeeding. My fiance and me gave them up completely when our son was 3 years old ...

SnQvsOPwaa	Any one who has not been taught copping skills for their anger has the potential to be an abuser.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	anyone is capable of being an abuser if put in the right circumstances. this guy obviously was never told he was wrong and never had any discipline. now he is just an overgrown kid having a tantrum when he doesnt get his way. unfortunately he is physically big enough to hurt another person. too bad- its sad what parents do to their children by not disciplining them and preparing them for the real world!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I think there are sooo many different aspects to what makes a person an abuser. There could be outside influences that caused his behavior (maybe he was abused by a relative or neighbor). He could also have a chemical imbalance or mental disorder that caused problems (such as bipolar-disorder). You also may not be getting the entire family story. Abusers are notorious for covering things up and keeping "family secrets". Typically, one would never guess that a family is dysfunctional from the outside because they are very good at putting on a show. I've read many books on childhood abuse, etc. and they all agree that abusers do not form out of nothing, they always come from a past of some sort of abuse (unless it's from a mental disorder).<br>  <br>  You need to also define abuse properly. He could have anger management problems that come from being spoiled as a child. His mother simply may have ignored his behavior and let him indulge in such actions with out teaching him about consequences. Like I said before, there are so many different aspects to becoming an abusive person.|`|v0BvbOOSaa	Children need discipline. That's no way to raise a child, just letting him do whatever he wants. The way this family raised their son, he had no coping skills to deal with anger and disappointment.From your's ex's point of view, whenever he got angry or abusive, he got what he wanted. So, this probably contributed to his abusive behaviour towards you.|`|oojO4WAraa	Anyone can be an abuser.  That is bs that abusers blame their actions on having a bad relationship with their mother.  Your ex just had anger control issues and his family indudged his inappropriate behavior.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I do research on the family. I'm going to suggest a perspective that might fit here. <br>  <br>  There is a theory that says that violence can become a part of a family system if it achieves system goals.  This was obviously the case in your husband's family.  They all bought into the "man as head of the household" ideology, and this became a goal of their family system. It prevented them from standing up to him or disciplining him when there was conflict. When he "got mad and stormed off," they gave him what he wanted - his power and control - and so his behavior accomplished a system goal.  It became incorporated into his family's pattern of interaction. This does not mean they didn't love each other.  They just had an unhealthy pattern of relating.<br>  <br>  Systems resist change.  As a newcomer into the family, your different background and outlook was a threat to their way of doing things.  They used their system tools - violence and abuse - as a way of maintaining their ways.  <br>  <br>  Your husband could have had a good relationship with his parents(although it sounds like he was seldom disciplined), but if the whole family accepted his behavior into their pattern of dealing with things, he would carry this into his later relationships. He could become abusive without their ever abusing him because they did nothing to stop it.<br>  <br>  Now it would be very difficult for you to change their system, especially since they don't seem to have any desire to change. Yes, it would take a miracle, almost.  Your MIL blaming you is just a rationalization that they use to justify not changing.  Change is very scary to that type of family and is avoided at all costs.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Here is the simple truth most don't want to acknowledge.<br>  <br>  Anybody can be an abuser. They CMFRCom all walks of life, all social and economic backgrounds, all types of families, all forms of discipline, and they can have goorelationshipsps with anyone.

fjTVAbdBaa	I can't really answer, everyone is different. And it can haooen in any order. Your water might not even break. You can go by the timing of your contractions, the closer they get, the closer you get. My water broke around 9, I went to sleep, woke up around 4 and went to the hospital. It takes hours, and hours to have a baby. You probably have time, but there is no way to tell for sure. And seriously, my hospital was 30 min away, I could not wait to get out of the car! 3 hours is a really long time to sit in a car with labor pains. Oh, and don't count on going early. I think everyone says that when they see a huge pregnant woman.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Well your water wont always break the doctors will do it for you. If this is your first baby you are usally in labor for awhile. Average time being 14 hours. When you start having contractions (and you wil know) Time them the closer together and the longer they are the closer you are to having the baby. Since you want to go 3 hours away I would start on your way when the contractions are just becoming regular. Its painful and if you decide you want pain med. its better to get there ealier.|`|1WBimx1laa	I think they say you have an hour to get to the hospital after your water breaks but i dont think you should push it. If you start feeling labor pains you should go stay at a hotel for a couple of days so you are closer to the hospital or stay with someone closer.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	There's no specific time that it takes to deliver after you're water breaks. Some have no feeling or symptoms of labor until their water breaks then it does and the baby comes in 30 minutes. Some are in labor for hours and have to have their water broke and still have hours of labor ahead of them. I don't know what else to tell you other than when you get to the point that you're far enough along you can see if you're doctor will set an appointment to induce you. I personally wouldn't induce labor unless it was absolutely necessary but I guess it would be up to you to weigh the pros and cons of that situation. Good Luck and God Bless.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	No matter what any one says on here I would not risk anything on someones answer.<br>  My mom's "water broke" and I was born literally 15 minutes later. Same with my Brother and my sister.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	everyone is different. Some people's water breaks before they have any pain and some people's don't break at all until the baby is coming out. You can't go by other peoples answers on this one because everyone is different. You should go by the pain before the water breaking. When you start having regular contractions go to the hospital. Even if it's BEFORE 7 minutes apart that is fine (just to be safe) Most 1st time moms labor last between 8 an 24 hours. on average 10 to 14 hours. You will have time to go to the hospital. If your water breaks before you have contractions go straight to the hospital. If you have contractions first, wait for them to become regular. Sorry this was so long. :P" Good luck...

For some reason, she has a grudge against me and my friends. I go to a really cliquey school.) I just shot her a dirty look though, never said anything. She got up in my face about I was disrespecting her so I apologized because I didn't want to get detention again. :/<br>  5. nope<br>  6.

MOsStEbqaa	Yes as long as you don't start to bleed heavy then you are fine. I'm 9 weeks and i still have cramps on and off.|`|m2aznd8xaa	very normal|`|WBw9lDG8aa	congrats........|`|TN6IQYoPaa	Don't worry at all it's very normal, I am in my 5th week and i get them too, just not very bad ones and i have back ache almost most of the time, and everyone says it's normal. Got something to do with your body getting used to stuff. <br>  Congratulations and good luck!!!! :-)|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Cramps are nothing to worry about. Your uterus is growing to accomodate the baby. Backache is common.|`|9458d8261ad19b804a5c1744c5508b0baa	yes I had bad cramps in my pregnancy for first 8 wks my lil girl is here and healthy|`|3f3ba2deef7e904bc28bbb494ec7b708aa	I have been having pains by my ovaries also. I dont know if its normal but I think its ok. Is this your first or second baby? Cuz this is my second and my mom told me that things stretch out faster with the second cuz they have been stretched before. So I dunno if that helps you at all. Backache is completely normal...if you are really worried call the hospital and ask if they can give you any information|`|AA10022551	You need to get this checked out as soon as you can get to an ER tonight.  It could be a dangerous ectopic pregnancy -- particularly with the ovary involvement.|`|UusqE75paa	It totally normal I'm two weeks preggo and cramps and lower back pain your body is just getting ready for your growing baby.... Good luck|`|SwEvO7aUaa	Im sure its nothing but just in case you should get it fixed
2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	I've heard castor oil ~yuck or spicy foods.|`|m2aznd8xaa	you can pleasure youself   it the orgasms that trigger the labor. nipple stimulation, and lots of walking.|`|R0RnjdnXaa	Go for a walk around your neighborhood that really helped me with my first son and I wa 40 weeks one day when I had him and didn't want them to induce me either. I delivered fast with not that much pain. My water broke and 3 hours later my son was born :)|`|xfxlpT2Waa	go for a walk, and eat spicy foods and take castor oil even though its gross. hopefully this helps and hopefully u dont have to go through induction|`|d71203d118a10dbd920ebc4a3ac6942caa	nipple stimulation- dangerous<br>  masturbation with you coming<br>  walking<br>  scrubbing floors on your knees|`|bo4MguzVaa	go on walks.<br>  <br>  jump up and down|`|QeDRqflEaa	walking and nipple stimulation
TQW5E6olaa	Sinusitious, rhinitious, but my first pick was the ever popular allergies.<br>  <br>  My daughter and I both have allergies and are sensitive in general to certain scents, dust, chemicals etc which make our nasal passages inflame and we sneeze. We're both on antihistamines most of the time.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Sinusitis will make you do that!<br>  <br>  Here are 5 common causes..<br>  <br>  Allergy to pollen, mold, dander, or dust (hay fever) <br>  Viral infections (common cold, upper respiratory tract infections) <br>  Nasal irritants such as dust and powders <br>  Withdrawal from drugs such as alcohol and opiates <br>  Corticosteroid inhalation, such as with asthma medications<br>  <br>  Edit again : it's an inflammation of your sinus passages basically.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Yeah your sinuses are most likely messed up or you have allergies you can actually go to walmart or any local store and get some medication for both of them if it works at least you pin pointed what it was! Good luck!|`|yL9To7Nzaa	also looking into bright lights or at the sun creates a sensation that makes you sneeze
29zyJ95Eaa	Well let me tell you, I'm no expert, but sugar does NOT effect your activity. In fact I am 15, I am Diabetic, but I still have chocolate and sugary foods and it hasn't effected my sleep at all.<br>  It is a bit funny that your daughter has stayed up until midnight but that could be something else, like maybe did she have coca cola?<br>  But as far as I know, chocolate has never effected anyone I've known in the activity and sleeping area.<br>  I hope this helped :)
Le1mibkIaa	You have to have a prescription .... I took the med and it worked very well .... You ob will most likely want to do some test b4 giving you the prescription though ... your ob will most likely want to see if your tubes are open and shoot dye up them to make sure they are open b4 giving you the prescription ... talk to your ob <br>   Mommy of a week old baby girl !!|`|imFpyj7Gaa	Need a prescription.|`|n3FfpRqCaa	You need to get a prescription from an ob/gyn
wTB9xTvDaa	neither, but i would have to say Nora<br>  Taylor reminds me of some ugly "chick" on drake and josh, a mooch from highschool, and some ugly chick in elementary school.|`|rUhyDm5faa	i really hate the name nora, and taylor is really popular, but i think taylor is a popular name for a reason. it sounds both pretty and strong. i like it much better than nora. i don't know if i would name my kid taylor, because it is so common, but i do like the name taylor better than the name nora, popularity aside.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Norah|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Nora because its feminine.  I am not a big fan of unisex names.|`|8ucq6SEjaa	Taylor(:<br>  <br>  sounds cuter.|`|1AOr7waCaa	taylor|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Nora... My baby cousin's name =)|`|igMh0iL3aa	I don't like either but if I had to chose, Noarh|`|mgCvQx9jaa	Taylor!|`|N5EhfDX2aa	TAYLOR IS A BOYS NAME! <br>  <br>  Norah by far. Its a gorgeous name. I prefer the h on the end because it reminds me of the classic name Sarah. Pretty pretty pretty!|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Taylor <3 <3 <3 <3|`|aXaaQQAgaa	Taylor is what everyone uses i really like norah|`|b6dnIGoYaa	Taylor|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	Nora|`|rSXZOU5zaa	Norah|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Taylor|`|fb101442e93f61cc6d8149465ab7e585aa	I would choose Nora/Norah. Taylor is a cute name but is way too popular these days.|`|U2w775zZaa	They are both nice but i love the name Norah its gorgeous.|`|6lBWoKrgaa	taylor|`|WVzsrJGXaa	taylor|`|S5dfa6o9aa	I love the name Nora. Taylor's a good name, but kinda common. I knew like 6 Taylor's growing up. Well, there's my vote.|`|xuRj20HVaa	I like Nora better, it seems more classic|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I think Taylor is cute (:|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Neither they suck.|`|gM2eyQFKaa	Nora. Taylor is somewhat common, but it's still cute. Anyways, one of my best friends is named Nora. Plus, Nora just sounds kinda sweet.<br>  <br>  Well, there's my vote.<br>  <br>  Love: Remy|`|f17IvOjUaa	TAYLOR is a very pretty name|`|dUmP6In9aa	taylor|`|UgJvpsiaaa	i love the name taylor i have a little sister named taylor ann and her twin thomas they just turned 10 months|`|4FHntIOraa	both <br>  but i would say taylor|`|VHHis05Naa	Nora, by a gazillion miles.|`|AA10624857	I really don't care for Taylor or Nora.  However, I dislike unisex names so Taylor is definitely out for me.  Of those 2 names, Nora would be the better choice.|`|ljFBfguRaa	Taylor|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Norah...it's about a million times better than Taylor.|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	Well, I like Norah because Taylor is way too common.|`|ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	Hard to choose as they are both pretty names -- but choose I must:<br>  <br>  Taylor
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	If you are having regular ultra sounds with your doctor, NO. <br>  There used to be a chance back a couple of decades ago, because their technology just wasnt good enough. Since then our ultra sound machines have come a long long way. Weve learned much more information, and having twins or multiples and not find them at your 20 week ultra sound is very very extremely highly unlikely. <br>  If you were having twins, or multiples, and you are seeing your doctor, then he or she would notice. For sure!|`|vWb8fquvaa	Sure but that's a rare occasion|`|vygYFdsSaa	This was more common in the past when we didn't have such sophisticated technology. Now it seems almost impossible but it does happen. Sometimes a baby will hide behind another one.|`|S3t69kh2aa	Yes, of course!|`|b50nfGjRaa	yes it is; my mother had miscarried and didnt know that she was supposed to have twins until then
s4LWmcTjaa	Yes and no.  Really it depends on what my child does.  For this particular described instance, I'd say let it slide this time.<br>  <br>  If she threw an all out tantrum or was hitting you or exhibiting extreme misbehavior, I don't care if they are tired or not that kind of behavior is not tolerated.  If I'm not allowed to throw tantrums just because I'm tired, then neither is my kids, LOL.  Kids can be tired and act like it.  But there is a point in time where saying "it's just because they are tired" doesn't excuse it.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I think I would  probably tell them I know you are tired ,I am too so lets get this done so we can go! I would consider them being tired but at the same time it is still gonna irritate you and make you upset, I know how it goes!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	When it was my fault  being over tired, to long without food or overwhelming them I would try to get them to behave but I wouldn't punish.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I would let it slide in that situation. I know I certainly get grouchy when I'm tired.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I let it slide, if he is over tired or not feeling up to snuff.|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, I wouldn't punish. <br>  <br>  I would try to arrange my schedule to avoid this type of problem.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|9ff653285dcca235b469d9b2b3442377aa	I think you have to take the situation into consideration.  Both of my kids will act up if they are tired or hungry.   Personally, I can't discipline them when I know I act the same way when I am tired or hungry.  Kids sometimes just need a little bit of wiggle room for discipline.  <br>  <br>  Most of the time, if I am with my Mom she knows the kids are tired or hungry if they start acting unusually naughty or oppositional.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	she's a little girl. she's going to get grumpy, she was tired and ready to go home. i don't think you should have disciplined her for not "cooperating"...<br>  it was your fault for staying later than planned, therefore it is not her fault for acting out.<br>  if i were in your position i wouldn't have disciplined her...but to each his own.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I'd let that slide, mine get grumpy and ill when they get hungry.  I try to remember that these little people feel the same emotions we do, but as adults, we know how to handle them...imagine how they sometimes get overwhelmed and don't even really know why.  You did the right thing.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Choose your battles wisely.  You did the right thing.
vygYFdsSaa	Nope that's completely false. It is possible to conceive the first month off but its not the easiest time at all|`|MwcNwpIvaa	Everybody is different of course, but I was pregnant within weeks [not even a whole month!] after I stopped taking birth control. I had been on it for seven years. For other women, it can take months or even years after getting off birth control. Guess you can just call me Fertile Myrtle.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	no the hormones is still acting like you are still on bc. its like 3mths after on or once you get a normal period you can conceive..i sure did|`|HoonZJMgaa	Not at all. Everyone is different. It also depends on what type of birth control you have been using and how long you were taking it. If you want to begin to try to conceive, you should stop the bc and take a multivitamin and just do it naturally. And you will be blessed when the time is right.|`|Coc593Ikaa	No, not true at all. In fact many doctors suggest you wait for three months before trying. The reason is that your uterine lining doesn't build up as "fluffy" (docs word, not mine) for the first few months after you go off of the pill. And you want the healthiest lining possible for implantation to be effective.|`|VVQv9GX1aa	It works differently for everyone, but I conceived only a month after quitting the pill.<br>  With some women their doctor may put them on the pill for a while to regulate their cycle, to help with getting pregnant.|`|axaD1D0Caa	No it takes almost three months but there are still chances though...
ANNHUReWaa	Missing pills in the first or last week. This includes starting the pack late. Why? Because the number of "off" days or placebo pills is increased, which can make you ovulate. Missing multiple pills in a pack, especially in a row. Taking pills at different times. Being overweight because the pill can be less effective. Certain medicines like antibiotics and St. John's Wort. Vomiting or throwing up before your body has a chance to absorb the pill.|`|F8EMQzxfaa	sounds like yor wanting to get pregnant. If you are then just stop taking it its as simple as that.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Human error. Not taking it properly or following directions. In rare cases though they just simply don't work.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	not taking it correctly or using certain drugs while on it (antibiotics)|`|9cu82009aa	Antibiotics, alcohol... it doesn't work properly on some people either, I was just talking to the hairdresser this arvo, she fell pregnant on the pill and on depoprovera. My cousins fiance fell pregnant on the pill. The pill is only 98% effective at anytime anyways.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	antibiotics will lower it's effectiveness. Also, if it is not taken everyday at the same time, it won't work correctly either. The hormones only last 24 hours so you have to take it every day. This is the pills. Not sure of the other methods like the nuva ring, shot, or IUD|`|vWb8fquvaa	If you do not take it as directed.<br>  <br>  Certain medications can also reduce the effectiveness. Be sure you research any meds before taking them and use a back up method while on that medication.|`|AA12008665	What kind of birth control? Condoms? The pill? The patch? The ring? The shot?<br>  <br>  It varies from method to method, but I guess you can say that the main reason birth control fails is because of human error.
EqfIQMzQaa	Don't be worried the longer they keep their baby the teeth the better the 2nd permanent teeth will be that's what dentists say!<br>  My kids didn't lose theirs till around 7 and never got their 1st tooth till past their 1st birthday.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I never lost a tooth until I was 8 1/2.  I STILL have baby teeth that I obviously will never loose.  I think it's hereditary because my oldest (7) just lost her first tooth a few months ago. It happened out of no where.  She's lost 2 more since then but she's still very behind in the tooth loosing department compared to her friends.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. No cause for concern.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter lost her first tooth a few months before she turned 6.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	OMG - thank you for asking this question!  I completely forgot about the tooth that my son lost earlier today!  <br>  <br>  Anyway - it can happen anytime at all, that first lost tooth - from 4yo to 6yo or older.  One thing's for sure, they're coming out eventually!  Don't worry!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	around six or 7 some times even when they are 8?|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Between 5 and 7-8, I think.  I definitely wouldn't worry about your daughter.  I didn't lose my first tooth until I was almost 7.  I'm sure hers will start coming out soon. :-)|`|prqrQcd1aa	anywhere from 4 to 7 or sometimes even 8 years old.<br>  I was 4 when i lost my first tooth, but i also started getting them at 2 months old!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Kids usually start losing their teeth between 4-7 years old.|`|kP0Dv0Kfaa	6 honey my little brother lost his teeth at 6 years old
kaqPSgTVaa	If you are pregnant you most likely tested too early. MOST women dont' get positives that early. The outside of the box says you can, and you can, but early testing only works for less than 50% of women. Most women can't get a positive until at least the day their period was due. Wait until the 8th and test again.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Its very possible you are pregnant. Its not unusual that you haven't tested positive on a test yet. I'd suggest waiting to see if you miss your period and then taking another First Response test. Lots of luck and babydust xx
4RjM5lElaa	I pumped and nursed as well.<br>  <br>  I also shook the frozen milk at first then swirled it bcz I changed how I heated it.  If it's too hot or shaken the proteins do get broken down but do not fret over this.  If you little on is still gaining weight then all is well.<br>  <br>  I heated water in the microwave, then swirled the frozen bag in the cup then massaged the milk until it thawed.  I didn't freeze too much though - I ended up pumping to store for one day ahead (I was not a heavy producer) so in the end I moved from freezing to just keeping in the fridge since it never was more than a day old.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|qaMrAspCaa	i think if you overheat it you breakdown some of the proteins, same with shaking it.  But i wouldn't worry to much, if your baby is gaining weight i'm sure it's fine. Live and learn. And no matter what it's better than formula, shaken and all! Congratulations and you are giving your baby a wonderful gift!<br>  <br>  EDIT: <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/shakenot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/s...</a>
vygYFdsSaa	There should absolutely be a detectable amount of hCG in your urine. However, for whatever reason some women never test positive on a HPT. Go get a blood test its 100% accurate|`|AA11197832	Yes:  It would be a positive test.  6 weeks is long enough for a Pregnancy Test to determine pregnancy!|`|bo4MguzVaa	in most cases yes.  but there are exceptions<br>  <br>  blood test is the best way to be certain however.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	More than likely, but there have been some women (not a huge number) that don't test positive until 8 weeks or so but again not a huge number.
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Drink a sugary drink about a half hour before the ultra sound. I had my 19 week ultra sound today. I drank apple juice right before the ultra sound and my little boy was EXTREMELY active in there. He wouldn't stay still at all. It worked very well for us. It was very easy for us to tell that he was definitely a boy. <br>  Good luck.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I thought drinking orange juice was an old wives tale, but IT WORKS!! Drink some right before you go to the doctor's office. Or anything really cold. <br>  <br>  My baby had her umbilical cord between her legs, so I had to go hoe drink a lot of cold water and go back in to find out.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I drank a cup of coffee right before I went to the ultrasound he was bouncing around everywhere. Good luck|`|DMsjoZwSaa	The ultrasound tech that did my ultrasound had me walk around for 5 minutes, wiggled my tummy, and even tickled me! He knew the sex, however wanted to get us a good picture of the baby's goods, and therefore worked with us about getting a good view. After shaking me, wiggling me and causing an earthquake in the womb, we couldn't get a clear picture... eventually the tech had me use the restroom (even though I didn't have a full bladder) and that was enough to give my soon-to-be baby girl room to spread 'em! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	That happened to my friend last week!! She was so upset!! She too is going back next week!! What I did with my daughter, I drank a buddy size lemonade as well as plenty of water. Apparently soft drinks really get the baby moving :) Good luck!!|`|Le1mibkIaa	you can drink caffine ... Not good for the baby but will get it moving ... or try a sunkist lots of sugar... I remember when I was pregnant hot chocolate got my baby moving alot  try some things b4 you go and c what works best...... hope that helps<br>  Mommy of a week old|`|ryvO8DMaaa	They say eating something or drinking something like orange juice right before helps.  I remember at mine my daughter was not showing anything off either but FINALLY by the end of it she had no shame and just showed us everything.  Good luck!|`|7cDT7h9oaa	Drink lots of orange juice before the ultrasound. It gets your little one moving!
CeJHsdCMaa	Maybe hire a nourisse.   That's will give your nipples a break...|`|dnLL4J71aa	how old is your baby, and why are you weaning?|`|fjTVAbdBaa	depends on how old your baby is. If they are to young to start on infant cereal, you'll have to pump.|`|xUNowEfQaa	Have you considered weaning to a sippy cup?  If baby is over 1 she might not even need bottles.<br>  <br>  Weaning should be done gradually for both of you.  Try eliminating one feeding every 4-7 days.  (Start with the mid day ones and let the morning and night ones be last to be eliminated.)<br>  <br>  If you get uncomfortable (as with engorgement) pump, but only pump 1-2 minutes.  You just want to be comfortable without telling your body to keep making milk.
ufcQlbGNaa	I would also say 4 years, thats what it is in australia, you can buy a safe and sound medi rider, and they are from 8 months to 7 years, which apparently they are now recommended to stay in a carseat with restraints (not just a regular seat belt ) until they are the age of 7, my father is a paramedic and he says the horror he has seen in a car accident when a child isnt secure enough. children slip under seat belts in serious accidents thats why a car seat is designed to have shoulder straps, and too many parents are taking the risk of putting small children in booster seats, basically he thinks booster seats are a waste of money and you are better off buying a car seat which your child can use for a few more years, and remember you get what you pay for.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	4 years and 40 pounds is when they can go in a booster. How much does she weigh? She would probably do great in a Graco Nautilis. It runs about 150 at Walmart. This seat has a 5 point harness to 65 pounds and then will become a booster till 100 pounds. My 3 year old is 36 pounds and last time we checked a little over 36". I doubt your daughter is within these limits. My son sits in the seat I mentioned and it will be the last seat he ever needs.|`|cZcS54ujaa	what kind of booster? a seat a bigger one up to like 45 or 60 lbs. She needs the straps over her shoulders. Her bones aren't very strong yet she will bit in the kind for like 3 or 4 year olds|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Age 4 years<br>  <br>  <a href="http://parentcenter.babycenter.com/404_w..." rel="nofollow">http://parentcenter.babycenter.com/404_w...</a><br>  You can safely switch your child to a booster seat if she's at least 4 years old and she weighs 40 pounds or more or has grown too tall for her car seat (when her shoulders are higher than the top set of harness-strap slots in the car seat's back). Whatever you do, don't move your child to a booster seat simply because she's had her fourth birthday. Car seats are the safest option, so keep using yours as long as it fits. You'll also need to check the car seat law in your state (you can use the Child Safety Laws tool at the National Safe Kids Campaign site to look up local regulations).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.car-safety.org/faq.html#Q7" rel="nofollow">http://www.car-safety.org/faq.html#Q7</a><br>  Q7: When should a child be put into a booster?<br>  <br>  Many convertible and forward-facing seats have 40 pound weight limits when using the harness. A convertible or forward-facing seat with a 5-point harness is the safest option for children from 30-40 pounds who are not too tall for their forward-facing carseat. If a child's shoulders are above the level of the top slots in their regular carseat, or the tops of their ears are above the top of the shell, then they may be able to move to a booster or another forward-facing seat which accommodates taller children. Usually a child can be moved to a booster when they are too big for a harnessed carseat, and once they are able to sit properly in a seatbelt. A child should be in some type of booster seat until around 8 years old, unless they are already 4' 9" tall (Also see Question 9 below).<br>  <br>  Q8: My child is over 40 pounds or too tall for his carseat, but isn't mature enough to sit in a seatbelt with a booster. Are there any options?<br>  <br>  There are a few Forward-Facing and Specialty Models for this situation. First are the Britax Wizard, Boulevard, Marathon and Decathlon convertibles with 65 pound front-facing limits. There is also the Britax Husky, with an 80 pound harness limit, though a top-tether is required for above 50 pounds. Next is the Safety Baby Airway, a combination booster with a 50 or 55 (new version) pound harness limit. New models like the Cosco Apex also have a 65 pound harness. There are also some discontinued models that can still be found online or at ebay. They include the Britax Super Elite (up to 80 pounds in a harness), the Fisher Price Futura (up to 60 pounds in a harness) and the Britax Laptop (an approved restraint to 65 pounds). You may also use a Safe Traffic Systems RideSafer Vest or E-Z-ON Kid-Y harness/booster.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/firstaid_sa..." rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/firstaid_sa...</a><br>  Kids should stay in a car seat with full harness until they are at least 4 years old before switching to a booster seat.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Booster Seats (40-80 Pounds)<br>  <br>  When your child reaches the maximum weight allowed for the car seat or your child's ears have reached the top of the car seat, you'll need to switch to a booster seat. Booster seats are designed for kids who have outgrown forward-facing or convertible safety seats but are still too small to be properly restrained by the vehicle's seat belts. Many states have passed laws requiring booster seats for kids up to 8 years old and 80 pounds (37 kilograms), or 4 feet 9 inches (about 150 centimeters) tall.<br>  <br>  Booster seats come in many styles. Belt-positioning boosters raise kids to a height where they can safely use the car's lap and shoulder belts. They come in high-back or backless models: High-back boosters are recommended when the car has low seat backs, and backless boosters may be used if a child's head is supported up to the top of his or her ears by the vehicle's back seat or head support.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	45 lbs
aCUHzMrmaa	I think these people wernt ready to have kids, and they definitely should have thought about that when they had sex. Mine wasnt planned either but i love it. I dont get much sleep is my only complaint but at least something worthwhile is the cause of that lol.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I wouldnt say they resent their children, maybe they just kind of need to vent? Maybe they dont have someone that they can call up on the phone and go lordy I'm losing it today. It was my choice to have both of my children and they were both planned, but sometimes I do get stressed. I'm basically a single parent hubby works all the time and when he is home he is sleeping because he works nights. And he is taking classes three days a week. So I do get stressed sometimes bc I never get a break. Now if they were saying I hate my kids and my life then thats different.|`|prqrQcd1aa	sometimes mom's just need someone to vent to..doesn't mean they don't love their children or are resentful towards their families, just means they are HUMAN!|`|K7H1zrCbaa	sometimes venting helps people relieve stress.  I guess not everyone can be as good of a mother as you (sarcasm).|`|6cN8aLnaaa	OMG! I so agree with you. My pregnancy was a complete and total unplanned surprise, but I wouldn't change my little girl for anything in this world. She is my everything. I mean it's pretty sad when your best friend is a three month old lol. I can't imagine ever having bad feelings towards my baby. She is my life. She didn't ask to be born, but I am certainly glad that she was. Ready or not I am willing to do what ever is necessary for my little booga. I don't care what sacrifices I have to make. She is all that matters.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	I really don't think there are "so many moms" that complain about motherhood.  I see it once in awhile, but not a lot at all.  Some moms are probably stressed out, or maybe they need to vent - I completely understand that.  I'm sure those mommies love their families-maybe they were just having a bad day.  Hasn't that ever happened to you?|`|7jXChfBNaa	you go girl! i totally love being a mom and love my baby more than anything in the whole world. i agree with ya 100%.|`|a4i45Yumaa	Unless you are a Stepford Wife you are going to have days of complete stress.  It's better they vent on here than take it out physically on their baby. And I haven't really noticed a lot of resentment or complaining.  Congratulations to you...you're a robot!  I love my daughter more than ANYONE or anything in this world, but sometimes she tests me and I think lots of moms would agree with me on this when I say letting the frustration or stress out by talking to someone their own age makes it easy to refresh and go back to taking care of your child with a clear head and light heart.  You're lying to yuorself if you say you've never had an AAahhh! moment. Shout out to my precious angel baby! =)|`|TQW5E6olaa	I haven't seen more than a handful of people resenting their children....the majority is just mom's who've had a bad day and need to vent.<br>  <br>  I think every parent has moments where times are tough, or irritating, or sleepless and it's very natural to complain, it's unloading, makes us feel better.<br>  <br>  Parenting is also a very long, thankless, and expensive commitment, don't you ever have bad days?<br>  <br>  I love my daughter so much, even though I've gone through so much to have her, i'd do it all again in a heartbeat. BUT there are some tough days. She had a asthma attack this past week and everything that's gone with it has me emotionally exhausted. All the medication she's on is making her act so unlike herself, its been ROUGH. I'd never resent her, it isn't possible, but it hasn't been easy.|`|AA10943329	I haven't heard people complain about motherhood. I have heard them ask for help on aspects of it but not complain
DMsjoZwSaa	It could be the wipes causing the smelly discharge. <br>  <br>  I am an avid Summer's Eve feminine wash user and I had to stop using even the sensitive skin soap because it caused a bacterial imbalance in conjunction with my crazy pregnancy hormones. <br>  <br>  The next time you see your doctor, mention the discharge and ask if you can leave a urine sample in the event it's a bacterial infection that you can get antibiotics for or if it's just a standard yeast infection. <br>  <br>  Many times women just assume they know what a yeast infection is and take the over the counter treatment when really it's a bacterial infection...be safe and see the doctor. :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	It could be any number of things, is it chunky like cottage cheese?? Gross question I know but you should just go get it checked out, easier than trying to self-diagnose and if it is any kind of infection you'll need medication anyways|`|h5cFkP35aa	yeast infections occur naturally but they do not have a foul odor. it sounds like Bacterial Vaginosis. you could either ask your ob/gyn to test you or get one of those over the counter testing kits that you pee on. either way, it can be easily treated. good luck.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	If it smells, bad, then its probably an infection. Your discharge may change throughout your pregnancy, but it should never smell or cause itching.|`|azE51WGRaa	If it smells funny, then you probably have a yeast infection. You don't have to have sex to get one and you can develop one no matter how clean you keep it down there. Usually these are brought about by the changes in hormones in your body. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to stop your hormones but if you want to prevent yourself from having them often, try drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry pills (usually made by AZO and in your pharmacy dept.) Get yourself some medicine and you'll be fine. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Take care and good luck =D|`|IYULF7NDaa	being pregnant creates yeast. I get them only when pregnant so it could be. But it can also be BV so go see your doctor to get the right diagnosis.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hmm, it could be a yeast infection or it could be bacterial vaginosis, since you say the discharge has an odor to it. If it is a yeast infection your OB will recommend an OTC treatment like Monistat, if it is BV you will need antibiotics. Basically, since you don't know what type of infection you have you need to go see your doctor and have them check as the two types of infections are very different.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	if it was yeast infection you would know it by the itching and burning; what you have is probably bacterial vaginosis, which can be caused by a ph imbalance, sex, or hormonal activity... i would see or call the doctor and explain what was going on. but if it is bacterial vaginosis, becareful of the medication (antibiotic) they might give you. if it's flagyll, that crap is no joke! do not drink, eat, taste anything that has alcohol in it (mouthwash, cough medicine, beer, etc) because you will get violently ill. see the doc soon!

I dont see anything at all wrong with throwing your own shower.  Atleast you will get more say in everything.  Just start some baby registries and when you send out ur invite's include a copy of what you need.<br>  Good Luck|`|AA10458750	Instead of feeling depressed about throwing your own, as well as spending $$ on food, prizes & decorations...your best bet is to get all that stuff of of craigslist or a secondhand shop. As long as the baby has a place to sleep, enough onesies for a couple weeks, couple cans of formula, plus some  N & 1 diapers, all the toys aren't that big a deal and socks are super cheap!
ksWm9eCBaa	If you go full term, you're going to be pregnant for 40 weeks.  That means, if you have your shower in 3 wks, you'll have a whole 12 weeks (just a bit under 3 mos, by the calendar) to go before the baby comes.  I guess it's up to you: you'd be prepared really early, could take your time filling in any gaps that the gift-giving leaves and have plenty of time to sit back and eat bon-bons/watch soaps till the baby comes (just Kidding!!!!).  Another plus, if you get a 'surprise' (early baby) no worries!?  Hey...the more I write, the more this makes sense.  Go fer it!|`|6a9AfhsLaa	I would say its ok. Once you hit the point where a miscarriage is most unlikely, it would be best, just in case of a worst case scenario, but if you are finding out the sex of the baby, I might wait until you know, so you can plan around that, but I think that is close to when my sister had hers. Congrats on the little one! Good luck!|`|cEgI5ogLaa	I would go a little later, around 30-34 weeks is ideal, you are big and def. very pregnant and getting close to your due date with out being too close and too uncomfortable. You still have time to buy things you don't get for your shower after the shower without stressing on time, and it will give you something to look forward to for the next month or so.<br>  Good luck :)<br>  Toni Lynne|`|ThfO8bROaa	NO, ITS NOT TOO EARLY. MOST WOMEN HAVE A BABY SHOWER AT 6-8 MONTHS PREGNANT. SO AT 28 WEEKS PREGNANT IS PERFECT TIMING. CONGRATS ON YOUR NEW BABY TO BE!|`|Coc593Ikaa	That is quite short notice. You should be sending out invitations 3-4 weeks ahead of time! So you should allow more time for preparation.<br>  <br>  As for your timing in pregnancy, you'd be having one at 28 weeks, which is a bit on the early side. Generally they are held when the mommy-to-be is 7 or 8 months along. This balances how far along you are with still having time to buy what ever else you need after the shower.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	No, you have it when it suits you!! Your the boss! I had mine at 30 weeks :) I really think anything from 20 weeks is ok :) Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!!
0HcSfdBSaa	well i have ever had a 2 periods in one month.i went to see the doc and he said that it was as a result of the contraceptive i was using before i started using the pill....it really depends.having 2 periods in one month is not healthy because you loose alot of blood n it can make you weak.but its good to check with the doc.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	what i have heard is implantation only last 1 - 2 days and is not much at all . i didnt have it with my pregnancy so i do not really know for sure
9P26sacKaa	I'm having gallbladder problems with my pregnancy and never had issues before this month.  I had a severe attack that landed me in the ER for a few hours.  The pain went down and the ultrasound was clear and the bloodwork all came back normal so they sent me home.  I was in horrible pain for four days and couldn't eat much at all.<br>  <br>  Since then, I got an endoscopy to check on other possibilities and the specialist/surgeon suggested that I had gallstones that resolved when I massaged it two days before (the pain had gone down significantly since this).  I then saw a naturopath to see what I needed to do about it in the future and got some great advice about diet and some supplements and homeopathics to take.  This has helped A LOT, as I have been having a lot of milder attacks since the first, long one.  I say they're milder, but I still can't move much or do anything when they hit me.<br>  <br>  I went through a lot because they didn't see any gallstones on the first ultrasound.  Apparently, you can have other problems with your gallbladder and not show stones on an ultrasound.  Some types of stones don't show up and if you have sludge or just a malfunctioning gallbladder, it might not show anything wrong on the ultrasound.  If this happens, they might suggest you get a HIDA scan.  I didn't want this because it involves radiation and this has a slight risk to the baby.  If I were still in the constant, multi-day pain I had been with the first attack, however, I'd have gotten the scan.  I looked up the risk factor and it's very very small.  <br>  <br>  I've been able to control gallbladder attacks now that I know what to take and what to eat or not eat.   It's made a big difference, as has the homeopathic remedy - this has stopped every single attack in its tracks since the naturopath gave it to me.<br>  <br>  I was put on a diet low in animal fats (including dairy), and told to eat things high in fiber any time I eat anything with fats or protein (including vegetable fats).  I was told not to eat white pasta or rice, but to eat brown rice and whole wheat pastas and bread instead.  I can eat very-low-fat beef and poultry with high-fiber foods, but I need to stay away from them mostly, eating buffalo, elk, venison, and wild-caught fish as my meat sources.  It's important to get a lot of protein while you're pregnant, so it's been a tough time making sure I get enough protein from nuts and beans and other foods.  <br>  <br>  I was given a pill with a small amount of bile salts to take before I eat protein/fats (I can't take the normal amount of bile salts because of pregnancy).  I was also told to take Lecithin (found in the grocery store's vitamin section) to thin the bile in case sludge is the problem.  The one with bile salts has helped a lot and so has the homeopathic remedy.  I have had a few attacks since I went to the homeopath, but only when I ate certain foods without taking the bile salts or eating something high-fiber at the same time.  The homeopathic remedy has saved me every time.  <br>  <br>  It's been hard to change my diet... I still have a hard time figuring out what to eat for lunch and dinner, since I can't have ham or cheese (I usually ate something with one or both of these like a sandwich or mac & cheese).  I stress out over dinner because I can't make what I'm used to making.  <br>  <br>  Many people who have their gallbladders removed continue to have attacks and symptoms because the issue is a bile issue, not necessarily a gallbladder issue.  Bile is made in your liver, so if something is wrong with your diet and making hte bile weird to begin with or something is wrong with you liver, removing your gallbladder won't work.  The HIDA scan can usually give a better idea of whether or not removing the GB will help or not.  I'd definitely get the scan before having my GB removed, even being pregnant.  Believe me, I've thought about it, but I think I can control it with diet and supplements and keep my gallbladder.  Because they couldn't tell with the first ultrasound what was wrong, it makes even more sense to try to keep my gallbladder.  <br>  <br>  If I keep having problems, I'll be asking for another ultrasound and then considering a HIDA scan.<br>  <br>  There are symptoms of a bigger problem that requires immediate attention.  You should probably know these (nobody told me these... I finally had to call a nurse hotline and do some research to find out when it was a serious problem).<br>  -fever or chills<br>  -severe and uncontrollable pain (can't be controlled by pain medication)<br>  -jaundice, yellowing of the eyes or skin<br>  -vomiting<br>  -can't eat or drink anything without vomiting<br>  -clay-colored (white or very light) stools<br>  <br>  Good luck!  If you want to email me about everything, I'd be happy to talk more in detail about what I was told to do and help you find a naturopath in your area who can help you.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I have had gallstones on and off for several years now, thankfully no attacks during this pregnancy (not yet, at least). For me, eating a very low fat diet and avoiding raw vegetables helps. Increasing fiber also helps- when I start to feel an attack coming on I will mix Benefiber into orange juice- not sure why, but it usually helps.<br>  <br>  Different people find different things help them, so you might have to try a few different diets before you find one that works. Your doctor also might recommend that your GB be removed- this can be done safely during pregnancy. It all depends on how severe of a case you have.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	I can't say for sure it was pressed, but the second cycle we tried using it, we conceived.  I was having a difficulty with lacking CM due to clomid medication, so I decided to use Preseed instead of using KY or something similar.<br>  <br>  One thing i can say about it, it feels really good.  Very natural and my husband says it almost feels TOO good.  LOL LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I'd give it a try.  It definitely can't hurt!!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	just keep trying on your own. use an ovulation kit. if not go with the pre~seed|`|Lf5UY30aaa	I have been using it for several cycles, and still not preggos.
eKtEWrcmaa	Its a bit inconsiderate. Worse when asked in the trying to conceive section. A bit of a slap in the face I'd think. <br>  <br>  It really should be in the women's health category if anything. <br>  <br>  People just don't consider others when they post or well in most facets of life.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	there are a myriad of things that will cause you to be disturbed.<br>  <br>  during my pregnancy i couldnt stand the smell of my husband nor pancakes.  <br>  <br>  if you dont like the real life problems ...i suggest that you dont read them since they are so disturbing you and causing you stress.  not something you should be doing purposefully.  <br>  <br>  have a happy and healthy pregnancy|`|bIvsLrCUaa	These kinds of questions are very disturbing to me.  I wish people would just use protection if they don't want a baby so that the poor innocent thing doesn't have to suffer. :( it's not like they asked to be here.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Exactly! This is a forum for being pregnant, not how to become "unpregnant". It's so sad hearing about abortion. I watched videos about it once and I'm traumatized for life.|`|peQGGFPYaa	I hate seeing that sort of thing in the pregnancy section because the people that are here are pregnant and happy and want to be discussing fun things like baby names or ask questions about their pregnancy. <br>  I feel that people with those type of questions should be putting it in women's health. I am pro life but i understand that others aren't and they have questions about it. <br>  But the pregnancy section is about bringing new life into the world not about death.<br>  haha and yes hormones make you even more angry when you see it and more likely to rant and leave negative comments when you arent even that type of person.|`|vygYFdsSaa	YES absolutely. Every time I see a question like that I try to say something to that effect -- like this is a site filled with excited expectant mums, why would you ask that here? etc, I feel its VERY inappropriate.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Yes, those questions should be asked in the "women's health section"<br>  <br>  you don't want to be pregnant any more, fine.. but take your murdering a$$ out of the pregnancy section where women are pregnant and happy!|`|jF6Sfgyyaa	yes  because myself think its stupid if you choose to abort a baby and had  the abortion why should it be in the pregnancy question if you abort it your not pregnant|`|5LR1RZelaa	What other section do you propose they put them in?  As they say, don't give me a problem unless you give me a solution as well.|`|AA10458750	Yes!! We are all anticipating healthy pregnancy and then some a$$hole comes and asks an inappropiate question. ugh!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Seems like it's in the right place.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	I just try to ignore them|`|JK67TvpZaa	I agree that they should be in a seperate category however, I can see how they also pertain to pregnancy if people are seeking information.<br>  <br>  I also don't agree with abortion myself but I have seen situations where abortion is considered for real reasons.  For example the result of rape, and where the individual were physically unable to carry the baby to term without significant risk to their own life.<br>  It is a little unfair to suggest that all persons considering abortion were simply careless and didn't have protection and want an easy out because a pregnancy is inconvenient.<br>  <br>  I am unsure what an appropriate category would be.|`|WZQKevt8aa	Aaron, I don't think they are talking about people who have a legitimate reason for having an abortion, I think they are talking about people who post ridiculous questions like 'how do I get my gf to get an abortion? Slip something into her drink' and 'is there any way you can give yourself an abortion' and people who use it as birth control and yes, them type of questions are certainly not suited to this section when there are women who are excited about having a baby and who are trying to conceive.<br>  And people who are trolling are pathetic!! Why would you try and upset women who are pregnant who want their baby and are trying to conceive?|`|y8b4Cp2Yaa	If you are referring to my question. It was a pregnancy question. Just because im not happy about my pregnancy does not mean it doesnt belong here. <br>  Just because you  dont agree with me, doesnt mean i cant post here.|`|Og09Q7ylaa	Abortion isn't "baby killing." Stop deluding yourself into thinking that some blob of cellular yuck is a sentient being.|`|WfcLQSpzaa	they are so wrong!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	to me they do, yes. i think they should be posted in another section.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I think the troll questions about abortions are annoying, but for people who are truly asking for advice are fine, People who get abortions are truly pregnant. I can not stand the questions like "help my g/f is pregnant   what can I use to kill my baby myself"
J9C3oM0xaa	Well first i'm sorry this happened to you<br>  <br>  I think you should confront him about it and talk to him a little about it. You do have to prepair for this baby and hopefully he helps you.<br>  <br>  You do deserve better and i hope you find someone else who excepts you for who you are.<br>                                                              Good luck|`|myK3mW2gaa	Right now it is going to be hard for you to forgive him, but listen to your dad. You most definitely need to take care of yourself and that beautiful bundle thriving in you. Try to keep on talking to the father (with a level head) and let him be a part of the prenatal care (it will help him form a bond with the baby) His ex probably wont put up with it, and if anything at least you will have a better chance of him at least being in the babies life.|`|cMzq8NzJaa	though ive never been in that situation myself . i would say the same thing as your father. be patient with the guy. <br>  if he went back to his ex maybe there are still feelings there towards her. or he can be confused.. the only way you can know forsure is by confronting him.. but in a peaceful manner so you can sort things out for both you and your baby.<br>  remember that everything that you are feeling your baby is feeling too.<br>  <br>  <br>   its hard to forgive and its hard to let go and its hard to raise a child on your own but you are not alone so many women are in the same situation that you are in.. many of them don't have anyone.. they are alone.. but you have your father.|`|lT3tWUOaaa	After dating for just 3 months, it's hard to grasp the fact that your now going to have a lifetime commitment to each other through a baby.  I just had a baby 4 months ago, but I'm married, still young just 22 and it's hard.  You no longer have your you time, it's baby first, and your day and life revolves or should revolve around that baby.  It's strange that he ran back to his ex once he was told about the pregnancy but no surprising, maybe hes scared or maybe he just isn't ready.  3 months of dating is such a short time, and you guys don't even really know each other even if you feel like you do.  You need to experience both hardships and pain and survive through it to be sure that you have a stable relationship.  But it is what it is and you have to make the best of it for your baby, and believe me everything happens for a reason  although it doesn't all make sense now it will fall into place.  I know you feel scared and confused now but once you see that baby all your worries will melt away, and you'll be in awe of how you could possibly love someone so much and so unconditionally.  Men are truely like butterflies if you hold them to close you'll hurt them but if you hold them to loose they'll fly away.  Congrats on your pregnacy, it'll be fine.
cnK4X2sZaa	yes i did experience the same pain. i know they say that if you feel a sharp pain in your lower left side that it could be  tubular, but honestly i had that pain so often. i think their talking serious pain... and to answer your other question... i cant speak for everyone, but i know there is never a time where i feel for certain the baby is safe... only time is when i first leave my OB's office. and that lasts for maybe an hour.... and then we have the baby and we worry for the rest of our lives. oh the joys!!<br>  but dont stress out. keep yourself relaxed as possible. if the pain gets really bad then maybe contact your doc. but i wouldn't worry.<br>  congrats!|`|AA11197832	It's your Sciatica nerve.|`|3wq8n2BFaa	hey!  I am 9 weeks and having the same thing!  the pain isn't severe and i have had no bleeding at all... so, I just try to think positive and assume it's the baby making room for itself.  Good luck!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Yes I have that pain often, I'm told its my ligaments stretching which usually occurs in the 2nd trimester...I'm a bit further along than you but you could absolutely be experiencing stretching. I was also worried about an ectopic pregnancy but it only occurs in 1% of pregnancies, you're probably safe since you've made it to 10 weeks already without a tube bursting. Best wishes xxx
cEgI5ogLaa	You are not supposed to be lifting over 20-25lbs when pregnant it can do a lot of damage to your unborn baby. Listen to your doctor, they know what's best and are only looking out for you.<br>  Talk to your work and let them know you are pregnant, do what you can at work but don't overdue it. They can't fire you or lay you off for being pregnant, and you will not get disability leave. Talk to them and see if you can get more light duty work, as a nursing assistant I don't understand what kind of heavy lifting you could be doing though? I've never heard of this job position having anything physical like that? Just curious.<br>  Best of luck to you, think about your baby and make the choice that is best for you guys :)<br>  Toni Lynne|`|mqHL4UcRaa	First of all, stop planing on what you would do if you got injured and prevent this from happening. Your not suppose to be doing ANY heavy lifting while pregnant. You need to tell your boss that your pregnant and have them make arrangements for other staff members to do that particular job. <br>  <br>  Seriously, dont be selfish or ignorant. You need to put your baby first and stop lifting heavy objects now before you do any harm.
LkgrqlKXaa	Well, when you're that far along and you get vag. checks often it can make you just get sore down there. It could be braxton hicks contractions. Some time they can feel the same as the real thing but they're not.Usually when you're that close to your due date they are not overly active but everyone is different. Most first timers go past there due date but I would keep an eye on the tightening of your stomach and if they seem to get regular and close together it could be the real thing. Good luck!!!|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	yes.  it is possible and 38 to 44 weeks is the norm for delivery.<br>  <br>  you may be ready sooner than later to deliver.   take the next couple weeks for bedrest as much as possible.  <br>  <br>  have a safe and happy pregnancy!|`|rFUPo4YDaa	Your getting closer to labor that's what the soreness is. Your probably gonna have her sooner than your due date. Don't get scared it's normal.|`|70dzGtQIaa	Well, the contractions are probably your body getting prepared for labor, since you are so far along, but as long as those aren't painful, I wouldn't be worried about it.It sounds like she's in position to be born, though, since it's harder to walk and such, and since you already lost your mucus plug you're well on your way! (although sometimes it can come out weeks before labor). I'm guessing you'll probably have your daughter sometime in the next week or so.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	If your plug is out then labor has started and yes if it hurts to walk I'd say you're dilating even more.  Also, that tightening in your stomach is when you're having a contraction.  I'd call the doctor again and insist that he or she sees you.  If you're scared then just go to the ER.  They can do a litmus test as well as an AFI (sonogram where they check the fluid levels surrounding the baby).  Good Luck dear and Congratulations! <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, I just had my first child (a boy!!!) on Valentine's Day.  I was in labor for three days and they had to do a C Section but we're all fine now and I pray you are also!|`|QWyRISQKaa	I had my baby 11 weeks ago so this is still pretty familiar to me. That all sounds like a mix of the after affects of them checking you and early labor. I know you probably are tired of hearing this, but you will know when it is time. My advise though, stay close to home, get as much sleep as you can, and eat before you go to the hospital. Oh, and don't wait to pack your bags. Also, I wish I had done my hair and makeup a little bit at least. I had a bad back and leg ache the night before I went into labor so there you go. Congratulations and good luck.
vygYFdsSaa	Perfectly ok. You're entitled to be tired sometimes :)|`|AA10458750	yes, completly normal....it's the same for being hungry, some days you want buffet style and others you're fine with a water and snack..lol..pregnancy!|`|0dcc27270dec466a6b8dc9286e40de10aa	Perfectly normal...happens to me all the time :) I have read an article somewhere where it says, "pregnancy has good days and bad days" so I knew it is very normal :) Good luck!
YFPMcHCbaa	No it doesn't. You are fine.
lB405hQKaa	Yep it helps...and it is a great stress reliever! Good Luck and Baby Dust!!!!|`|eTPJNcilaa	Having an orgasm does not make your chances any less or better of conceiving.  You may already know this, but it does help to lay in bed after sex for about a half hour so the sperm have a better chance of reaching their destination. Good Luck !|`|zEXzwJ0Naa	well i think it helped me. we did the orgasm and putting my leg and bottom up in the air for about 30 mins each time after TTC and after 4 months, i'm pregnant. 8 weeks along.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Honestly it didn't help me ;) My doctor said it isn't really important. It's kind of like laying down or holding your legs up so no sperm leaks out after sex. It doesn't hurt to try but there is no direct evidence prooving that it really does anything.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Every little positive step helps!! (and BTW, its orgasm lol) <br>  baby dust to you!
8yTP3jO8aa	Normal, healthy 8 month-olds can eat pretty much anything we can, including this.  But, it's still a processed starch, which isn't healthy at all.
6a9AfhsLaa	Its just graphite, not lead. Though you sound like my parents. when my older sister was little, they called poison control because she inhaled bubbles....  its a lot funnier now than it was then, i'm sure. but don't worry. And if you're that worried, I'd suggest calling poison control before relying on the internet.|`|ONe2T42Vaa	no worries.<br>  I'm sure thats not going to be the worst thing he'll eat in his life.<br>  My niece has eatin paper, crayons, licked markers, etc.<br>  Just make sure he drank water, and watch for his temp. and stuff, even though im sure nothing will happen to him.|`|vWb8fquvaa	I wouldnt be worried unless he sucked on the eraser. Keep an eye on him. <br>  <br>  If you are really that worried, you should call your pediatrician. See what he/she has to say.|`|6aoJhFp4aa	Don't worry about it... i used too know a kid who ate earesers in like second grade... if he starts acting weird or sick bring him too the ER... im sure he'll be fine!!|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	pencil lead isnt lead you are fine|`|3NoDjKLoaa	He will be fine... dont worry. give him some water or something, rinse his mouth out.. hes not going to die.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Your baby is fine. Licking graphite isn't going to make them sick.|`|fAcVndo7aa	He'll be fine.  You're lucky if that's the worst thing he ever eats or licks.  The above people are correct, also.  Pencil "lead" isn't lead.<br>  <br>  For future reference, I'd keep the Poison Control number close to the phone.  He's sure to get into something that actually might be dangerous sooner or later.  In the US, that would be 1-800-222-1222.|`|m2aznd8xaa	he is fine. nothing to worry about. pencil lead is different from paint lead.  when i was a kid i used to lick my pencil lead alot in school before i wrote it was just a bad habit. and i never had lead in my blood.|`|AA10624857	All parts of a pencil are non toxic.  Your baby is fine.  Pencil "lead" isn't really lead, it is graphite.  Kids eat erasers all the time as well as chew on pencils.  It won't harm your son at all.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	LMAO! thats funny as!<br>  If you serioulsy thought your baby 'was in danger' you wouldnt be on yahoo answers asking people if it is dangerous. You would be in the ER right now.<br>  <br>  TROLL!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	pencil lead is graphite, not lead.
FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter has put a lot worse than that in her mouth and she's fine.<br>  <br>  Most pencils don't contain real lead anymore anyway.<br>  <br>  Relax. He's fine.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Get a grip. Everyone already told you not to worry the first time you asked this. Pencil 'lead' is graphite, and graphite is just carbon. You don't have to *do* anything.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Pencils haven't had lead in them for many many years.  It's fine.|`|fyyfPEemaa	he'll be okay !!!!!<br>  <br>  I asked my uncle and he's a doctor =D|`|vOFdHvlvaa	He's fine, pencils don't have lead in them like they used too, so he's fine, u shouldn't do anythin more than u already have, and there is no need to be worried about it, but if u are still worried, then call a professional (doc, nurse, someone like that, someone u trust) so that they can explain it too u, since they'd be able to tell u more than i could or most peeps on here could, and plus sometimes it's easier to take info form someone u trust.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	if your concerned call poison control....  or you  can call the ER they can tell you too.pencils don't have lead like it did like years ago.. kids eat all sorts of things.. i believe your baby is fine.. stop worrying and like i said if it helps you calm down call poison control and have them tell you your baby is fine..|`|AA12034666	Don't worry. He's fine. Babies put everything in their mouths -- everything they can get their little hands on. As long as he doesn't swallow it, or it isn't nasty and digsuting, he should be just fine.<br>  <br>  You have nothing to apologize for. All new mothers go through the same thing.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	relax, its all good. its not like he swallowed it. <br>  he will be okay. if you are this concerned, call the ER. but the pencils today dont have lead in them. so dont worry.|`|MbG0QZeaaa	He'll be ok! : ]<br>  Pencils don't have lead in them anymore so he'll be just fine<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  when i was like 10 or 11 I got pencil lead in my leg and I freaked out and went to the doctor but I was ok : ]|`|mfc6rzYSaa	Are you worried about lead?<br>  Pencil tips are made out of graphite, not lead.<br>  Nothing bad will happen unless the pencil is covered in flesh-eating bacteria :)|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It's just a pencil - he will be fine! No harm can come from licking pencils - hell, half the people in my elementary school used to chew on theirs. They all lived happy and healthy lives afterward.|`|15qceXaOaa	i think he'll be ok. but u should call poison control or the doctor instead of asking us on answers. its not like any of us r profesionals|`|xrEIAD2aaa	If everyone who licked a pencil died who would be left.  Sorry, but I wouldn't worry. There are definitely Alto worse things that can and will go into your babies mouth.Now if he was chewing on the pencil and fell on it in his mouth then I would worry.  You must be a first time mother.  You'll get over this soon. I'm not trying to sound insensitive, but I'm sure even you have put a pencil in your mouth and lived to tell about it.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Your baby is NOT in the danger he would've been years ago: PENCILS ARE NO LONGER MADE OF LEAD, BUT OF GRAPHITE...  I remember experiencing the same fear: no worries...you wouldn't want him to ingest a whole tube of graphite, but licking for only 6 seconds coupled with your excellent reflexes (wiping tongue immediately)--HE'LL BE FINE.<br>  <br>  Whatta good mommy~ :-)|`|GTu7pzFYaa	You don't need to worry,<br>  the lead in pencils, isn't actually lead,<br>  it's made up of a non-toxic mineral called graphite.|`|VmgdGYRPaa	Your right in worrying because that means your being protective. He will be just fine, the only thing i'd worry about is how many germs are on the tip! (probably not too many because you sharpen it...) But have no fear.|`|F1igZsMXaa	he'll be fine, all he was licking was graphite and wood. it actually tastes pretty good, give it a shot.|`|LKZffm2saa	Its Graphite, not even real lead that they use in pencils. The coorprate managers thought of these situations and use Graphite now for just that reason, youre baby will be fineeee!|`|JfPoJnnWaa	I really don't think you should worry. i asked my mom and she is an LPN (nurse) and she said there isn't enough lead to poison him. He should be just fine :)|`|IwQynLjtaa	Don't worry girlfriend!<br>  Nothing bad will happen!<br>  I seen worse.<br>  Just wash his mouth a little.<br>  Love You!<br>  LOL!|`|DhUqibKDaa	I have no idea how to answer your ?? but I can say if you are so worried, just call the dr!! thats what they are there for!|`|xKtdWzXlaa	It is a pencil honestly get a grip on reality|`|8VaSOTfnaa	Even though you would think pencil's would have lead in them...they don't. <br>  <br>  <br>  Completely ok.  But if you are worried...call poison control, and have them reassure you.|`|AA10624857	There is nothing toxic in a pencil.  Pencil lead is not made of real lead anymore, but is graphite.  Your son is not in any danger.  If it makes you feel better call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222.
AA10458750	I haven't had surgery yet...but I know when my cysts ruptured, it made me extremly fertile and I got pregnant that month. I'm not sure if it would work the same as you having the surgery done, but get a test to be safe!
PwhrTNZraa	No, it's the time between your periods that makes the difference.  You count the first day of your period as day 1, then count how many days it is until your next period starts again.  Textbook cycles are around 28 days with ovulation generally happening around day 14 of the cycle, but unfortunately we are not all based on a textbook.<br>  <br>  If you really want to learn when you are ovulating you can try using an ovulation predictor kit (they work great, I loved using them), and/or you can start charting your BBT (I tried that too and it works really well but takes a few months to establish a pattern).|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	No, it doesn't.  I range between 28 days to 40 days, and according to the ovulation tests, I ovulate between days 15 & 19.  Ovulation tests are important for women like me!  I've tried the (BBT) Basil Body Temperature method, but I don't have a normal sleep schedule, so it doesn't work for me.  It's recommended to be used when you're able to sleep a solid block of time, and you have to temp as soon as you wake up before you get out of bed.  Doing anything before that will change your temp & give you inaccurate results.
azE51WGRaa	When the doc stripped my membranes with my daughter (I was 37 weeks then) I had a little bit of brown discharge. Brown discharge usually is old blood and unless you have a lot of it, you should be fine. If you are having red discharge, you should call your dr. because this is new blood and may mean you're in labor. It could also be complications arising. You never know. Just to be on the safe side, I'd call your dr. or whoever is on call and let them know what's going on. If this isn't possible, then call the Labor & Delievery department at your hospital. Good luck. :)
vygYFdsSaa	Serious question?? No idea what "genie" is code word for, but no type of smoking is OK during pregnancy<br>  <br>  You don't have to freak out on us for not hearing of "genie" before....<br>  <br>  Also do you even know where to get such a thing? I did a google search and didn't find anything about this herb.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Well, if you already know so much and think it's so good for you, why are you even asking?|`|jgtfWjE4aa	wtf is genie? don't smoke ANYTHING while pregnant.<br>  <br>  idiot.<br>  <br>  my apologies for mistaking genie for marijuana. but, uh, you should PROBABLY describe what "genie" is to everyone on here because no one has even heard of it!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you shouldn't smoke anything while pregnant.|`|7xsJHSGTaa	ok, first of all...what the hell is genie<br>  second of all...NO!|`|9z5YJKqLaa	wow.<br>  if smoking is more important to you than your baby's heath, please  don't have it|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	hope you baby doesn't turn into a dumb ***** like you.|`|peQGGFPYaa	I am assuming your talking about smoking things as in a method of cooking. and i think genie is a type of sausage. <br>  if this is the case i dont think you should because of the literal smoke that comes out during the smoking process, just like i wouldn't recommend starting a bon-fire or being in the direct line of smoke. <br>  hope this helps. sometimes people see SMOKE and they assume cigarettes.|`|mQBwQKtOaa	i dont know judge you like the rest of these people. I do not think its good to smoke anything while your pregnant. Please avoid as much smoking as possible. It could damage your child in so many ways. Find another way to deal w/ your morning sickness like eating crackers or getting those morning sickness lollipops|`|HoonZJMgaa	Hi I am not here to judge you at all only to answer your question. it is not only the ingredients contained within the things you smoke that can harm the baby, it is the actual smoke as well. Just to be safe you shouldn't smoke anything. Good luck and God bless!|`|vj93MNjBaa	There is no herb called "Genie".  You're either spelling it wrong or else you're nuts.  Did you mean gentian?

Use your brain!|`|fb33cd04ca8f4989254b614e893d7fffaa	What is Genie?|`|DMsjoZwSaa	If you are talking about marijuana...<br>  <br>  I don't condone that you do it, however, my doctor (a top-rated infertility specialist and one of the nation's best fetal health surgeons) nearly prescribed a temporary medical marijuana card for me (I live in CA) due to extreme, extreme morning sickness. I'm currently in my 6th month and have yet to gain a pound...Since I found out I was pregnant I have dropped 30lbs and have been admitted into the hospital. Because no other medications for nausea are even SAFE for pregnancy, this was nearly a last resort and I considered the notion. Apparently, in Jamaica marijuana is prescribed for most pregnancy pain and during labor/delivery and scientifically has no adverse effects on the fetus (Google the effects of marijuana on pregnancy!). The only "bad" thing about smoking marijuana is the period of time in which one is holding the smoke in their lungs...the baby is robbed of that one breath of oxygen...My doctor compared the lack of oxygen to the lack of oxygen I'd experience if I had the hiccups. However, in a medical circumstance pills or eatables can be used with the same effects instead of smoking. <br>  <br>  Like I said before, I don't condone the act, however, IF you have a severe case, it is healthier than popping synthetic pills with chemicals that are unknown in their effects on pregnancy. People have been smoking marijuana for a very, very, very long time and more tests have been administered on marijuana than with any other substance. <br>  <br>  Also, remember that cigarettes have a WORSE effect on the fetus, so please, please, please, if you are a smoker, slowly decrease the amount you smoke until you can stop.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	I would think that smoking of any kind would be bad for you but for all I know Genie is a sausage you're taking out back to place in Ye Old Smokehouse.  Yeah, what the heck is "Genie"?<br>  <br>  <br>  OK, now we have some more details.  But what's the number one ingredient?|`|yf4o7aNwaa	if the number 1 ingredient is suggested for pregnant women, why are you asking then? and if your dr told you about it then i don't understand what you're questioning...|`|7jXChfBNaa	i have no idea wth genie is but i know that you can not smoke anything while you are pregnant no matter what it has in it.
AA10483706	Maybe he is gassy. Try some gas relief drops. Also, make sure his noise is not clogged up. That is the only way they breath, and if there noise is stopped up, and there sucking.

kpnSKV6Eaa	my best advice to you is to have as much sex with your husband as you can during the first 2 trimesters while you can because once you hit the third it is very hard and strenuous to do so... also this is definatly a mental thing so as long as you decide not to let your pregnancy slow you down then you wont have any problems i.e. waddling, back pain, none of that hit me because i didnt think it was as bad as people are making it out to be,trust me its not... and my pregnancy has flown by.... due in 2 weeks, whooooo!!!! dont worry about misscarriage.. just worry about taking care of yourself first and you baby will follow.<br>  <br>  also you can sign up for www.whattoexpect.com they will send you one email everyday giving you helpful tips and hints on how to deal with everything thats going on at the moment you are in during your pregnancy.. week to week updates and much more.. you can also blog with other pregnant women who are in the same week along as you are|`|oXIYHsDaaa	sleep when ever you can for as long as you can because you will never have enough sleep again :) No really, get lots of rest and eat what ever you crave (as long as it's food, some women crave dirt) because chances are you are laking a vitamin or mineral in the food you are craving and you will most likely be able to hold it down even if you have really bad morning sickness.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	gratz!<br>  <br>  u can have caffeine, but only 150-300mg per day. if u'll be craving chocolate be careful bc it contains caffeine, better check online wut kind of chocolate and how much caffeine is in it.<br>  <br>  do NOT change a kitty litter bc it contains bacteria that can harm the baby.<br>  <br>  google "food to avoid while pregnant" u'll be able to find the entire list of wut not to eat.<br>  <br>  do NOT get a massage below lower back unless done by a professional massage therapist WITH pre-natal certification to give a special pregnancy massage. there r points in ur body that can cause a miscarriage or early labor if massaged.<br>  <br>  drink LOTS of water and also lots of milk, the baby tends to take a lot of calcium out of ur body for its' own development, so u need as much calcium as possible to keep ur bones strong.<br>  <br>  u might end up getting a lot of heartburn, so make sure u have at least 2 pillows during the night to keep ur head elevated, it helps heartburn, also Tums and Rolaids are safe and work pretty good.<br>  <br>  buy some IcyHot cream, bc sometime in second trimester ur back will start hurting and IcyHot works wonders.<br>  <br>  try not to get too stressed out and don't think bout the miscarriage so much, if it happens, there is nothing u can do about it. just be careful w/ wut u eat, take ur prenatal vitamins daily, eat lots of fruits for the nutrients for ur baby, drink lots of water and try to avoid all the stress. just keep urself busy and think happy thoughts.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|AA10458750	**Congratualtions!** I woudl recommend going to babycenter.com, they have so many useful tips for new moms.

Your first three months are terrible, but once you get to the 2nd trimester, you will feel better, so hang in there!|`|m2aznd8xaa	very normal to be feeling this way ,even to have scary dreams too. but as long as your taking care and see the dr regularly youll be fine.best advice take thoses prenatals and dont stress out,and lots of rest. congrats. mom of 2 girls, 9 yrs and 21 months. i was super scared both times to. welcome to mommy hood and the 24 - 7 worrying has begun and will last forever. lol|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I agree with Serenity.

Most of the time a miscarriage is caused by some defect in the embryo, so there's nothing you can possibly do to change it.  Miscarriages are not caused by lifting things or having a Coke or standing near a microwave or anything... so just live your life.  I was a nervous wreck with my third pregnancy (after 2 miscarriages) and my daughter is extremely high-strung, and I have always worried that my craziness during pregnancy somehow caused her to be that way!  :)|`|Drze0cUXaa	all you can do is take the best care of yourself so your baby stays healthly,  do this throughout the whole pregnancy. take prenatal vitimans today!! those are very important and just relax, you can't enjoy being pregnant if you worry about problems with the baby all the time. Congrats and good luck!|`|bo4MguzVaa	dont eat cold deli meat<br>  <br>  that's somthing I didnt know until I went on a deli meat binge...it can contain listera...a bad bacteria that can harm your baby.<br>  <br>  if you eat it, then heat it until it is steaming first.
7jXChfBNaa	i think to me it sounds like you are pregnant. if you only took a test in january you should test again and it would be accurate. the sore nipples and hardness on your belly sounds like pregnancy cause that's what happens your tummy gets hard. if you can before monday i would just buy a cheap test and take it just to get you through the weekend. hope you get the answer:) by the way your stomach could be hard already don't listen to people lol. mine was at 9 weeks and my sister in law's was at 10. so it is very possible.|`|5m5hfKrBaa	if you missed your period in Feb. you should have tested then... <br>  you said you were late in jan. so you didnt get preggo then... <br>  so i would say that there is a chance that you could be... <br>  <br>  i would have tested again but i also have to know when i and even one day late|`|r5VFLa84aa	Hi, I am the official gyno for Yahoo Answers. I gave you an ultrasound through the internet at the exact same moment that you submitted your question. You ARE pregnant. Thanks for choosing Yahoo Answers for all your pregnancy needs.|`|5y4pY97Laa	there r likely chances that u r pregnant <br>  good luck :)|`|Z7qxXNl0aa	The only thing you can do is take a test again...you probably took one too early...also before i got pregnant i always thought i was pregnant but bcuz i was thinking that my body kinda played tricks on me.<br>  but to me it sounds like you are..<br>  congrats<br>  and good luck!|`|35xruAUYaa	It is likely that you are. A friend of mine had multiple urine tests by her gyn and all of them said negative. So he done a blood test and she was. So keep your appointment and tell the doctor everything. Some women have periods during ther pregnancy.|`|5Z2p45DVaa	I don't understand catrish, but have you had sex after your latest period?....then it's possible you could be pregnant I suppose.<br>  <br>  ----sorry I couldn't answer this properly~~!<br>  also, I'm kinda looking forward to reading the answers you get...|`|41BI6dDkaa	sure sounds like it...|`|70dzGtQIaa	I would say it's a good possibility that you could be pregnant. You might have taken the first test too early. I would take another one if I were you. As for you stomach being hard, that probably isn't pregnancy related because that doesn't usually happen until at least the end of the first trimester (although it was month 6 for me. It just depends on the person.). Taking another pregnancy test is probably your best bet.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If your period is still late and its weeks later retest.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Your stomach wouldn't be hard this early. Your uterus would still be in your pelvis. I would think you would have a positive test by now if you were pregnant. All you can do is wait and take a test in 3 more days (HcG doubles every 72 hours if you are expecting) or get a blood test done at a doctor's office.
3w4lRAUraa	whore|`|4e67Pdfvaa	the 2 weeks ago seems too soon to find out, so I would guess the first guy.. but most women find out arround 5 weeks or so... so who did you sleep with then? the neg test means nothing.. it doesn't always show up right away. <br>  You need dna.. 2 weeks apart is too close to call|`|vWb8fquvaa	Good lord. How on earth can a bunch of people on the internet determine that for you?|`|Le1mibkIaa	Well.... The best way to tell is base it off your period .... Ok if you have your period on the 1 and it ends on the 7 your going to ovulate 2 weeks after that which would be the 21 .... you can get pregnant a couple days b4 then sperm can live up 2 72 hours !! I hope that helps a lil bit !! <br>  <br>  Mommy of a week old|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	like really?? well all you can do is go to the doctors and see if  you are pregnant and if you are ask how far along and try to determine the day you had sex and see if it matches up,... <br>  <br>  next time don't have sex with multiple people.|`|bo4MguzVaa	there's many different ways this coulda gone, and it was so close together that measuring the baby lenght and estimating fetal age may not be as accurate as you'd like it to be<br>  <br>  DNA is gonna be the answer here.|`|tbMV3yOFaa	Its the first guy.  Symptoms don't show up for awhile.|`|WZw7k0GIaa	The only way to figure it out is to exactly how far along you are. You need to figure out when the first day of your last period was. You most likely ovulated 2 weeks after that. That should help a little bit.
vygYFdsSaa	I'm 16 weeks and I'm still terrified. I got my first scan at 10w3d and I was excited but also SO nervous. I cried when I saw the baby had a heartbeat. You have to just remember that the chance of something going wrong is rare. One good sign is that you aren't bleeding, that makes me feel safer.|`|Coc593Ikaa	I was very nervous beforehand. Then I saw my baby and was happy that there was a baby, not just a sac. Then I saw the nuchal thickness, and my heart dropped. I flat out asked if it was too thick, because it looked too thick. The tech did agree. My husband was confused, as he didn't really know what I was talking about, he just knew that something was wrong. The scan was completed, and I shakily got dressed to talk to the doctor. I had a CVS a week and a half later since my screening came back 1:20 odds of a chromosomal problem. Good news....the CVS came back completely normal. I had bawled my eyes out for weeks over what turned out to be nothing!<br>  <br>  I do wish that that first u/s had been full of nothing but joy for me, but that was not the case. However, I did get to know I am having a boy at only 13 weeks along due to the CVS results.

But he was a weedy, strange boy who was annoying. <br>  It turned me of the name for life. But since you don't know that Connor then i think it's a nice name.|`|RF07iThiaa	I like it but even as an adult they may or may not so maybe you can use it as a first name and of course give him a middle name and if he doesn't like connor than he could choose his middle name.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	my best friends name is connor, when we was younger he was VERY athletic, now we is muscular and sucsessful. (:<br>  connor is a great name!|`|T0NvgQTUaa	I dont think Connor would be weird for an adult.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	nope, but I think its a more modern name then my era.|`|TE7foNwMaa	I think Connor's a great name. It works much better for an adult than some names... I really can't imagine an adult with any of the "aiden" names (Aidan, Brayden, Kaden, Jayden...) or Nolan. But I can imagine a Connor much more easily. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that I only know two Connor's... One goes to my brother's college, and is a Junior this year. I haven't really met him other than a short "hello", but I hear stories about him and see pictures of him on a regular basis. He sounds like a pretty fun guy, and seems to be the kind of person that everyone loves to be friends with. <br>  <br>  The other Connor I know is surprisingly a girl...I really don't like her that much. I definitely prefer Connor for a boy. She's a year younger than me (she's a freshman in high school) and is a bit big-headed and selfish. She's not a very fun person to be around... <br>  <br>  So I suppose that makes sense. The most selfless and fun person to be around being the boy Connor, and the most selfish and annoying person to be around being the girl Connor... Heh, no offense to her at all, though. <br>  <br>  I also know a dog named Connor...does that count? He's one of those amazing dogs that can jump in the air and catch just about anything that you throw at him. It's pretty cool. He always has a "stick of the day" that he carries around with him at ALL times, and brings to you if he ever wants you to throw it for him. He's pretty great...but I doubt that this information about the coolest dog ever is really that helpful in your naming process... :)<br>  <br>  I think Connor will work fine for an adult. By the time he's an adult, it will seem "normal", and will fit in MUCH easier than the aiden's I think.<br>  <br>  My neighbor (she's almost 3) is named Aislin... pronounced AYZ-lin... I really can't picture her name on a high school student, and even less on an adult... But some day, she will be an adult, and it probably won't seem "weird" to me by that time... Hopefully what I'm saying is making sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I love Connor. It's on my list also. <br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I know 5 Connors<br>  They're 14-18 though.

Omkari Panwar, 70<br>  <br>  Her husband, Charan Singh Panwar, 77, mortgaged his land, sold his buffalos, spent his life savings and took out a credit card loan to finance the treatment. <br>  <br>  “At last we have a son and heir,” he said. “We prayed to God, went to saints and visited religious places to pray for an heir. <br>  <br>  “We kept no stone unturned and God has rewarded us.

I can die a happy man and a proud father.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Record<br>  <br>  The twins, born one-month premature and weighing only two pounds each are healthy and expected to survive, according to doctors at Jaswant Roy Speciality Hospital. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Family ...

I just want to see my new babies and care for them while I am still able.” <br>  <br>  Gynaecologist Nisha Malik, who performed an emergency operation on the 70-year-old said: “I was shocked when this old lady told me she was pregnant. I have been practising medicine for 20 years and I have never heard of such a case.”|`|AA10624857	I know I am not the oldest by far, but our youngest was born when I was 38 and my husband was 39.

AA11341633	I don't actually have this one but I have one similar. The only advice I would give is to check that the padding in the seat is fully removable and washable. So much food gets stuck in the folds and creases and it gets dirty very quickly if you can't clean it properly.<br>  <br>  Just something to think about. Good luck with the decision!

vACBeHSfaa	Well, based on your chart, you definitely have not ovulated yet.  You have not had a build up and then dry up of cervical mucus and you have not had a temperature shift.   I have PCOS and rarely ovulate, so my charts all look like that.  I have fairly steady temperatures and on and off cervical mucus.  After 4-6 weeks (or more), I will have some breakthrough bleeding, usually light-med. spotting for 5-7 days.  Does this sound like you?  If so, you may want to think about getting tested for PCOS.  It is the most common reason for not ovulating.<br>  <br>  I am not aware of any way that you can ovulate and not have a temperature shift.  Temperature shifts are due to the production of progesterone.  After you ovulate, the follicle (corpus luteum) triggers your body to produce progesterone which causes your cervical mucus to thicken or dry up and causes your temperature to rise.  As long as you are taking your temperature correctly, you will be able to see this shift.  You should use a basal body thermometer, take your temperature at the same time every morning before getting out of bed, and keep your bedroom conditions fairly constant (i.e. not use an electric blanket on and off or keep your bedroom window open on a very cold night).  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	yes it's possible to ovulate without a temp shift and the only way to know for sure it's by taking ovulation kits, <br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!

cEXzXkqnaa	The only way you can know for sure, is to take a test.<br>  <br>  you know you can by a test at the drug store for $10...<br>  Shees, where i live you can buy them at the 99cent store.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	the only way to know for sure is to test or see a doctor. It's the ONLY way. If you have a DOLLAR you can get a test. The dollar store, yes the dollar store, sells accurate tests. I took one 4 days before my period was due and got a positive. Take a test.|`|JP2h62qiaa	you would be showing by 17 weeks most likely. Have you missed your period by 17 weeks? That would be a good indicator.|`|yNoENquTaa	if your 17 weeks into your pregnancy i would say one should know by now. you probably would have felt the baby move and a missed period is generally a very good indicator. i'm a little concerned though if you haven't been to the doctors yet. you can't hold it off forever and it is an important thing to do for your health and your baby. you need to start looking to book into a hospital soon!!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Why don't you want to take a test?? They are very cheap, they're available at the dollar store and at Wal-Mart for 4 bucks. 17 weeks is too long to wait to go to the doctor.|`|bo4MguzVaa	take a test   good luck<br>  <br>  oh, and when the baby pops out in 9 months, thats another good way to tell

FpWqQE3maa	Most kits cost between $20 and $50, and are 95% accurate.
3NoDjKLoaa	flowers would be nice and her favorite food, or after she has the baby take her out to a nice dinner.. or even just keep a date night.. keep it like the baby isnt changing anything between you two (not that it wont, or that you dont care about the baby, but that you still think she is just the same woman you fell in love with) also, go with the suggestion of taking care of the baby, not just standing by and watching, get hands on!  In the birthing room, she may be testy, be there for her, but dont be too overwhelming, even though you dont have to do the work, she still wants you there, trying to understand how she feels and help her with whatever she needs.. (back massages are nice!) The baby will get lots of gifts from family and friends, there is no need for you to do anything but love him/her and give it lots of attention.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Honestly, I guarantee that she will be just as happy if not more happy with a kiss, a hug and you telling her how proud and thankful you are that she is bringing your child into the world.<br>  As for the baby, just make sure that the nursery and everything is ready for when you guys can go home :)|`|1SGl03Zlaa	When my sister had her first baby her husband got her a necklace with a pendant of a mother holding a baby.  Something like that or a #1 mom pendant would be nice.  For the baby you could just by a cute little teddy bear and if you want something kind of sentimental get a news paper from the day he is born as a keepsake.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I personally think that the best gift you can give her is your help and Comfort after the baby comes home.  She will need all your  help as she can get.  Mostly new mothers are so much in stress after the baby arrives that sometime they go to depression.  So make sure you are there to comfort her and listen to her and always tell her how wonderful wife and mother she is.|`|sHKrDChwaa	Gifts are overrated. Kiss her, hug her, tell her how beautiful she is and how grateful you are for bringing your child into the world. It helps when you've spent hours giving birth and know you look awful, lol.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	A "push present" is acceptable. And for the baby just make sure every thing is ready.|`|rQEl0f2Paa	I think it's such a nice gesture to give a gift.  Speaking from someone who just had a baby a thoughtful gift would be best.  Maybe have someone run out and get flowers for you.  Or how bout a #1 Mom necklace.  I think it's a nicer gesture to just give the gift for your wife and then maybe you two should pick out something for little one together!  The important thing to remember is just to be there for you wife on the special day.  Listen to her needs and be there to support her.  She may want you to shower her with affection or she may want you to be hands off. Best of luck to you.  Being a parent is such a joy.|`|xUNowEfQaa	The best gift you can give her is HELP with the delivery and HELP with the baby.  She will be sleep deprived and if you could wake up with the baby and go and change his diaper and then bring him to her in the bed so she can nurse, then take him when she's done and put him back to sleep, so she doesn't even have to get up, that is a huge gift.  <br>  <br>  If you can help around the house, vacuuming, picking up, helping with the baby laundry, that kind of thing, that is a HUGE gift!<br>  <br>  Give her lots of love and patience, and ask her if she needs anything.<br>  <br>  And, congratulations!|`|fBGIUSfaaa	the best gift you can give her is your patience and help... life is about to change as you know it. Let her sleep when the baby does and be practical like- housework. If she is breastfeeding help out in other areas with bub with nappy changes and bathing bond with the baby too. Good luck!|`|p16Ug6C8aa	take appointment of hospital near to you. also pack bag with all accessories like powder, you wife night gown, some baby clothes etc keep if near you you may have to rush anytime.|`|2gh6HQGdaa	you should take care of  the baby. try to get experience out of your friends. continue being married and don't give up.
AOvtRBU9aa	My baby is 12 months and I still haven't started my period yet. Thank  GOD! I really don't miss it. It's one of the perks to BF.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	3 months|`|Bw18seFqaa	I bled up until about 4 weeks...  then had a period at 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  No more periods for me for a while tho.. my Dr prescribed me a continual birth control.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	if you are breastfeeding the spotting is normal, and you may not get a period at all for a long time, ask your doctor about it. (some breastfeeding women dont get their period until they stop breastfeeding) if you are not.. then you could be pregnant again (yes that soon, its very easy to get pregnant right after having a child) <br>  I bled for about a week after having my son (by csection) and then got my period about 2 weeks after that. (normal period)
aMHIA7XMaa	The only way you are going to find out with reasonable accuracy is to have an ultrasound. Anything else will just be based on old wives' tales and not be very definitive at all. But, what the hell - there's a 50/50 chance it could turn out right so try the tea if you want.|`|YNH2fmYWaa	a boy or a girl?<br>  they should be able to tell you on an ultrasound..and what do you mean by teas?<br>  <br>  im sorry i dont understand.|`|YbCISxYZaa	ultrasound..|`|PikH7XOFaa	Um. Schedule an ultrasound. That's the best way to tell.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	why ask now? You've gone all the way without knowing and only have to wait another 2-4 weeks anyway! Besides I'd be kicking myself if I couldnt wait any longer at 36 weeks, found out what it was then had the baby 2-4 weeks later.
AA11808238	Sure, report it. At the same time it is good that you took the responsibility to make sure what was prescribed to you would not affect your child. If you are that careful in that area, you are going to be a good parent to look out for your child once it is there.|`|lsiyoSRaaa	I would tell the doctor what happen.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I'd bring it up.  That's not right that they reccomend you take a class C drug and not tell you the risks<br>  <br>  idiots|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would bring it up to the doctor.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	it COULD have been an ugly situation, but it wasnt an ugly situation.  dont make a mountain out of a mole hill.  and get a different doctor.

2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	No. Most women don't have symptoms that early.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are sure you are pregnant? Have you taken a test? They count pregnancy by the start date of your last period so you are probably actually 5 weeks. <br>  <br>  Not every woman gets early pregnancy symptoms.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	No not at all.

Congrats and good luck|`|m2aznd8xaa	no everyone is different. better for you if you dont get any. lol sometimes it takes a little longer to get symptoms but maybe your one of the luck ones congrats|`|vygYFdsSaa	Absolutely not. 3 weeks is very early; some women do not even realize they're pregnant at this point. You have nothing to worry about :)|`|cEXzXkqnaa	nah....i didn't get any symptoms until i was about 8 weeks along...then i got morning sickness out of the blue..<br>  <br>  I am sure everything is fine!!<br>  Don't worry...<br>   Congrats!!|`|n5nslYKuaa	<a href="http://answeringall.mooretolife.net" rel="nofollow">http://answeringall.mooretolife.net</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|7cDT7h9oaa	A lot of women do not have symptoms.

5UbC5hP9aa	I had this when I was pregnant with my second child. It felt like someone was constantly kicking me in the pubic bone.  My doctor told me the cartilage that connects your pelvic area around the vaginal area was beginning to shift and expand in preparation for the birth. You know the pelvic area has to stretch a great deal to get a human out. My doctor gave me a shot of Toradol- a semi-long acting pain reliever and told me to take it easy. I don't see why your doctor is not giving you vaginal exams yet to see if you are dilated. That is quite concerning to me especially if you are complaining of pain. You have the right to request one. He may not like it much- MOST doctors don't like being told how to do their job:) But if it is definitely still bothering you at the next visit, don't hesitate to speak up.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	i'm also 35 weeks pregnant and have experienced this. I had had it before and asked what it may be. I was told it could be the thinning of the cervix or i could be dilating. sure enough i was checked tuesday and i'm 2 centimeters dilated and 50% effaced. Your doctor should check you at your next appointment.|`|AA11901821	its proabably normal, as I have heard of this before. just keep walking, and when its time for this child to be born, it will come.<br>  Hopefully, u did take a lamaze class, because, by doing so, u will know the signs to look for , when its time.
Fa130w6Gaa	Sure, why not!
rNvXWMOMaa	no|`|5tqh0akYaa	It depends on who's party it is, who's going, and what type a girl your daughter is. If it is someone she knows and trusts, her friends are going, and she is responsible i say its okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im 14 ;)<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  wtf with the thumbs down?|`|daza5A4vaa	As long as she's responsible, I say go for it.|`|ULitp0PWaa	Yeah I don't see whats wrong with it.<br>  <br>  ?|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't see a problem with it. <br>  Sounds like it should be fun. <br>  <br>  Just find out:<br>  Who?<br>  Where?<br>  When?|`|AjAVHrKhaa	go for it theyre fun|`|X4VDkEctaa	Wars a GOGO party...I think I know but I'm not sure|`|HLKb961Qaa	Sounds like fun! Wear something funky and enjoy yourself!
el8yX5q3aa	I don't need to read all this to tell you one thing...<br>  <br>  IF SHE LIED about being pregnant...she will lie about anything.  She is manipulating and trouble.<br>  <br>  DUMP HER....she will lie about anything....There is nothing to understand about her.  She needs attention and the world is about her and what she wants....she needs chaos and drama in her life.<br>  <br>  Honey..find someone that deserves you.....you need someone that has her head screwed on right!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I'm gonna leave this answer, then read it and give a better answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, there is a few options here. She lied about being pregnant which is totally ****** up and if she did that you should dump her, cause even going to the extent of considering abortion for a "joke" pregnancy does say a lot about her capability of being a parent. she seems very immature.<br>  <br>  Now another possibility is that she was indeed pregnant and went through with the abortion in turn told you she was "just kidding" and that's the reason why there will be no baby in 9 months. Either way she's clearly not the girl you thought she was.<br>  <br>  A woman capable of lying about a pregnancy or even got an abortion doesn't deserve a guy like you. I'd say dump her and focus on school. Then you don't have to worry about this situation again. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I know this will all be hard but, I think the best option for you since there is no baby..is to focus on yourself.|`|GINmkQMfaa	Holy **** u rite alot and yes|`|5LR1RZelaa	Shoot man that's way too long to read.  Based on the first two sentences....if a girl told me she was pregnant with my kid to get me to stay with her when she really wasn't, yep, that'd be the end of it.  No need for drama or BS in my life.|`|LtIhkOWiaa	Girls are mental dude, but they shouldn't be that mental.<br>  <br>  That is a very legitimate reason to get shot of her man, that's a hecking terrible thing to do to a guy!<br>  <br>  Just imagine if she's doing this now, what will it be like if you got married?|`|ntdGOZqGaa	WOW, well you of course have every reason to be mad, pissed, hurt and upset. I would too if I was you. Do you know for sure if she was joking? Could she have possiblly said she was so she could get an abortion? I would make sure myself that she wasnt pregnant. I would maybe suggest she go to the doctor and get some proof saying she isnt pregnant and tell her that she broke your trust and now you are having a hard time trusting her since she did that, and how messed up that is that she then turned around and said it was a joke. Ya know, she should be very lucky that she has a guy that she can say hey I'm pregnant and you be ok with it, and turn everything around to take care of her and the baby. If you think you should dump her over this then that is your choice, I know me it would be something that would be really hard to overcome and it would make me look at her in a different light. Mostly because you both have such different views on abortion and all. I would do some soul searching and if in the end you still can overcome it then I would consider making some changes. But I would make sure first that she wasnt carrying my child. Good luck and I hope this helps some.|`|1thElV58aa	I did not read it all of it some.<br>  <br>  <br>  But someone you love does not joke around with being pregnant i think she might have physiological issues. Since you both decided if she did get pregnant you would get married and keep the baby. well if she got an abortion you dont have a say so in her decision cause its her body which i dont think is fare. Your  girl friend is an immature girl who likes to play mind games with you just to see how you would react. I think its best if you find a real women who can be completely honest with you in every way who would not joke about serious issues.|`|3Fma3URSaa	I think she's testing you to see what you'd do if there really was a baby.<br>  If you ditched her while she fed all this crap to you about the fake baby well she wouldn't actually be in trouble cause she's not actually having a baby.<br>  <br>  She wants to be prepared to see what your reaction is when she actually does get her baby and needs financial support. <br>  <br>  Don't dump her! She's just trying to be make sure she's not going to be a single mother living on the street because her boyfriend screwed her up and ditched her.<br>  <br>  Nice novel btw. ;)|`|5SJ5RIASaa	Do you think this girl is telling you now that she was joking about being pregnant because she has decided to have an abortion. She may feel it is easier to tell you she was joking then to tell you she is going to have an abortion no matter what you think. I would not be able to trust this girl any longer. What ever the case may be she sounds nuts get as far away from her as possible.|`|Coc593Ikaa	1. Yes, this is grounds for a break-up. This is the type of thing a 13-year-old pulls, not a grown college girl. You sound mature, and you need a mature WOMAN to live your life with.<br>  <br>  2. Just tossing this out there...maybe she didn't lie the first time? Is it possible that she felt you out about the abortion, then had one anyway, and is now trying to cover her tracks by saying it was all a joke? Do you think it is possible that she had a abortion, and the real lie is that she wasn't pregnant? Just some food for thought.|`|YgzpSbxdaa	She's a liar and a player. She picks out everything you are passionate about and everything your beliefs go against, and uses them to pick a fight. This could go on long after you are married. Leave now while you can and find a real woman who has similar interests as you. Because that woman is not her.|`|jcXSNjowaa	Alot of girls.. (sorry girls. im a girl too but its the truth)<br>  <br>  likes the attention.. or wants to put the man on lock down.|`|v1IzWlqQaa	Okay I did read it all....and I believe she is a very manipulative individual and that is not something that you joke around about...I am sorry I know she crushed your feelings. Yeah you should leave her...First time Shame on her...Second time Shame on you..I wouldnt wait for the next time...Good Luck with Everything!!|`|vWb8fquvaa	whoa, seriously thats way too much. I didnt even read all of it. <br>  <br>  Yes dump her if you no longer trust her.|`|czfyAyNBaa	.WELL SOME PPL DO THAT. THEY THINK IT IS A GOOD JOKE...WHICH IT IS....AND SOME PPL TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY. BUT MAYBE SHE SAID THAT TOO SEE HOW U WOULD REACT AND STUFF. MAYBE SHE REALLY IS PREGNAT SO THAT IS Y SHE DID IT.|`|X48z0Lwwaa	I wasn't about to read that novel...sorry dude.<br>  Dump that psycho chick.|`|XtBFA6Dlaa	leave her, girls are nutting but trouble|`|NPMKqJlMaa	cant u do long story short?|`|7zMtmKJaaa	a girl should not lie about that. does she even know you have feelings too?!?!<br>  what a dumb girl. i think you need to find someone who will never lie to you|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Alright, unlike 90% of the people that responded to this, I actually read your question... <br>  <br>  I would be extremely angry if I were in your shoes, sure. But, regardless of a hiccup in your relationship, you have to sit down and evaluate your future with this woman, whether she may have lied or not. Everyone lies at some point, some lies are smaller than others and most lies are just to gain attention...And you being so far away is a good excuse for her to WANT that attention. So, you have the choice to forgive her or let her know that because she made a bad decision, caused you so much stress, let you down and flat-out joked about being pregnant and wanting an abortion, you wouldn't be able to continue being with her. Does she have a history of being overly dependent? Surely her "lack of motivation" is a red-flag, but that could also just be her adjusting to you being away at school. <br>  It sounds so elementary to sit down and write a pro and con list, however if this is the woman you figured you marry one day, it may be worth it. <br>  Keep the paper with you while you're in class and jot down the little things you remember, it may help. Just make sure that whether you plan on staying with this girl or not, you don't make a quick decision that you may regret in the future. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish you the best!|`|N8OASrYpaa	WHEW! this is too long but i think you need to talk to your girlfriend what she did is immature. i don't know if you should dump her because you obviously still care about her and would do anything for her, i think shes having problems with you being away or she just freaked out over being pregnant and wanted to see what you would do if it was true. I think you and her should have a nice long conversation expressing your feelings(without any yelling) and why she would do such a thing and maybe shes having issues of her own that your not there to help her with. Or maybe she cant do the long distance, it sounds like there something more to whats going on with her that you don't know about. You said shes never done long distance so it might not be a good idea, even though she says shes okay with it.|`|XEiIYjT7aa	You sound like a rational man who's got himself an emotionally...troubled young woman. I think what she did to you was inexcusable, but ultimately this is a decision you have to make. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with her? If the answer is. "ehhhh...welll..." then maybe you should re-think your relationship at the moment. Emotionally stable, rational women don't mess with the emotions of the men they love...unless they're hungry for attention or insecure, or worse. You might be better off without her. <br>  <br>  That's my initial reaction from your story anyway. From the information given me (which is not nearly enough to make such a life-changing decision) I'd say leave her for your own good. She probably won't get any better as time goes on, and you need to find a woman to marry that you KNOW you will love and cherish forever. Not someone you feel an obligation to at the moment. <br>  <br>  Of course, if she does turn out to be pregnant and is simply an emotional wreck because of it, I would hope that you'd try and work it out with her atleast for the baby's sake.|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	Alright, my advice is to take some time to yourself and figure out what it is exactly that you want out life, and out of this relationship. You two have been together for some time, and have been through some troubling times no doubt. I don't thing she's insane for putting you through this, but I do think that she didn't think it all the way through. It could be that she told you all of this to see what your reaction would be and then just got too tired to finish the conversation like you said. It could also be that she wanted to see if you would leave or stick to what you two have talked about in the past. She could just be freaking out because you are no longer there and she's used to you being by her side day in and day out. She could have been fine with you leaving, but now that you've actually left, it's taking a toll on her and she doesn't know what to do. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hun, the only thing that I can honestly tell you to do, is to sit down, take a deep breathe, and focus on you and what you want to do with your life. I know that it might be hard, but try your best. When you've figured that out, call her back and let her know what you have planned, and don't let up on what you want.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	whoa dude, no one asks for a novel. judging by the question title, she's really not. pretty ******* up off her. you're justified in dumping her, but it's something you could work through if you still really love her and would lke to be with her and see a future with her.|`|e2NQUmusaa	Wow! that is messed up, I don't know if I could trust her after that. The first thing that came to my mind after reading that she told you days later that she wasn't pregnant was that she went ahead with the abortion, and is telling you that it was a joke so you would not find out the truth.  I wish you the best I don't know what I would do if someone I loved messed with my head like that. Take your time and think about it I know I would have to.|`|f4AJHCHKaa	Ok, so I read the WHOLE thing, and I think that if you feel like you can't trust her you shouldn't be with her. Lack of trust is only going to cause more and more issues in the future. <br>  <br>  What she did was cruel and wrong. I could never do that. I do think she has something going on mentally, it is just as bad to me as the girls who claim to have been raped, when they weren't. Maybe you can ask her what the hell she was thinking and judging from her answer make your decision. Its a tough situation, and I think only you will be able to say the right answer. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope that everything works out for the best.|`|fgRjL7MNaa	she probaly just misses you like alot.<br>  and thought it wouold get you to come home.<br>  then realized what she did and told you she was joking?"|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	I didn't read your whole story because it was too long, BUT i will tell you that if she had her period, she is not pregnant. And if you were overseas, how could YOU get her pregnant. If she was pregnant and freaking out and wanting to get an abortion, but still wants to married, I would think she was cheating and here's why:<br>  1. She said you guys would have a beautiful baby, but she doesn't want it. (Maybe because it's another man's and it wouldn't look like you?)<br>  2. She's trying to force you to marry you for reasons that don't add up. If she wanted to marry you and was pregnant with your baby, she wouldn't abort it. <br>  3.She wouldn't be serious and say she was pregnant and the be like 'just kidding!' unless she thought she was pregnant and later found out she wasn't , which she would have known she wasn't pregnant IF she really got her period.<br>  <br>  Basically, I have no idea what is going on with your girlfriend, but whatever it is, it sounds suspicious. At this point, you shouldn't dump her until you find out what is really going on because something is wrong and it seems like she doesn't wanna tell you.|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Abortion is the most logical thing to ever grace this earth. THE WORLD CANNOT HOLD US ALL. NOT EVERY BABY CAN BE BORN. The bible was written in a time when not all of your heirs were likely to live out their lives, so you were supposed to try and have a bunch. Today, the world simply cannot handle it anymore. <br>  <br>  Sure, you could argue that God is in control, and he won't let anything bad happen as long as we do what he says... No. That is completely fear-based thinking. That is the kind of thinking that drives lemmings into the sea.|`|zpbKit6Uaa	DUDE!! i say you dump her i mean you sound like sweet guy and shes just not the girl for you...you deserve someone way better:)|`|AIPJBq5Faa	tl,dr|`|6qCnpxrNaa	I actually get it...I think.<br>  <br>  OK, she was wrong to not tell you the truth but at the same time she was doing what a lot of people sometimes do.  She was trying to "see what you would say or do" if she chose a different option.  Often you never know what someone will say or do until "IT" really does happen.  I just had my first child almost three weeks ago but OMG...for the first trimester I really was nuts about everything.  It changed my whole perspective and I questioned everything and everyone.  (My poor husband)  Anyway, she may have had a legitimate moment (prior to discussing it with you) where she really did think she might be and it could have SERIOUSLY messed with her head which is why she messed with yours.  I'm not excusing her actions but PLEASE try to understand that it really can mess with a woman's head and it's likely she was not herself at all.  I know I wasn't and I know that while I actually was pregnant and she wasn't what I want you to understand is that I'm almost 35 years old and had been told I couldn't ever get pregnant but multiple doctors even though I wanted to and we'd tried forever.  So we were trying and I succeeded and you'd think I was happy right?  Well yes, I was and I am but it made me nuts and I was scared and surprised to death and had a bad reaction towards the end of the first trimester when it sort of hit me you know.  So try to give her the benefit of the doubt, especially if she's never done anything like this before.  It's a big deal for a guy but for a woman it means a little being has invaded your body and taken over and while yes it is a wonderful, precious miracle it's scary as hell and the stress of it can drive you nuts.  Good Luck and if you need to talk about this more then email me.|`|77HV1jsJaa	She is nuts, there is no good reason to make up a story like that. Sounds like she has some serious mental issues. Yes you should leave her. A person that does those types of thing to test you or get attention are just about capable of doing anything crazy.|`|AA10703634	talk this over with her and ask why she did<br>  tell her u don't like how she plays the this joke and stuff like that<br>  just confirm with her about everything  (i don't suggest marriage)|`|ThfO8bROaa	I'M NOT GOING TO LIE. I DIDN'T READ THE WHOLE EXPLANATION BECAUSE WELL, I'M LAZY LOL. BUT JUDGING FROM JUST THE TITLE ITS NOT RIGHT FOR A WOMAN TO LIE ABOUT BEING PREGNANT IN ANY SITUATION. TO ME, ITS JUST DESPERATE. IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS PREGNANT AND REALIZED SHE WASN'T THATS A DIFFERENT STORY.BUT IF SHE KNEW FROM THE START SHE REALLY WASN'T THAT IS DECEIVING. IF SHE COULD LIE ABOUT THAT MORE THAN LIKELY SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO BE TRUSTED IN THE FUTURE. IF I WERE A GUY I MIGHT BREAK UP WITH HER TOO. JUST THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP MEANS TO THE BOTH OF YOU . GOOD LUCK!|`|Y4C7ofKWaa	Has she ever done anything like this before?    That is your major clue.   Look back over your relationship, has she ever done or said anything "crazy" in order to get your attention?   Has her family or friends ever made any comments that would make you think that she does things for attention?<br>  <br>  My friend did something similiar before.  Her and her husband split and she told him she was going to give the kids away to CPA.   He was in another state and didn't have a car, so he was trapped without a way to get to his kids.    He was extremely upset about this.  She never did.  She just wanted to hurt him because he hurt her by leaving.    I thought it was terrible thing to say about your own kids and very immature.   But your story sounds similiar to me.  She also was doing poorly in school.<br>  <br>  It could be that she is so reliant on you-perhaps low self esteem makes her dependent on you and so her motivation is all gone at school once you leave etc. Therefore she is so upset that you are gone - and so she deliberatly says mean things to you to try to hurt you.  Maybe she feels you had a choice to study overseas, and you chose to go there rather than to remain with her.   So she is upset- maybe without even realizing it.    Yes, that is very immature.   Almost like a high school girl.    Some girls don't develop well emotionally and they can do immature things even when they are older.   some guys too.<br>  <br>  She may be worried that you might meet someone else there and so she is making sure to hold your attention while you are gone..thus the comment about needing to be married even if she gets the abortion.   She is trying to tie you to her, becuase she doesn't want to lose you<br>  <br>  She may think that if she tells you she might have an abortion that you will rush back to her side to keep her from doing this.   since she wants you there-she figures it is a good way to get you back.<br>  <br>  You know you sound like a very ethical person by some of the things that you wrote.   And I applaud you for your desire to take care of your baby and to want to work so hard to take care of your family.  I will say, that there is a little ditty that goes like this...first comes love, then comes marriage, and then comes the baby in the baby carriage.   All that to say, that because you are sleeping with her and not married, you are opening up this kind of situation.   I don't judge you for your actions, don't get me wrong, I am simply pointing out that she would never be able to joke about being pregnant if you weren't sleeping with her.   And this is a consequence of that decision.<br>  <br>  So now, it is kind of good that you are away.  You have lots of time to think about the relationship, about her as a person.    if you were still here you would be getting even closer to her, and obviously you need more time to think about this girl.<br>  <br>  You said she broke your trust once.    I don't know what she did, but there is something a little off about her actions.   You should be concerned about marrying someone like this.   If your dating relationship is like this-how will the marriage be?     <br>  <br>  If you do want to keep the relationship you need to be straight up with her-if you talk to her again-  and say that if she loved you that she would not have said something so hurtful.   And then tell her you want some time off for a while so she can think about what she did.<br>  <br>  Personally I would be very concerned about staying in the relationship.   She doesn't seem to hold the same values as you do.
ljFBfguRaa	It's extremely unique, but I like it!|`|T1xWH9yLaa	if you like the name then it is your choice to name the baby what ever you like, but remember when the child gets older and goes to a job interview, how will his name affect him in getting jobs.  It is sad to say but people will always be judgmental of  others.|`|fWLhwmF6aa	All that really matters is that you and your husband like the name.  If both of you agree then name him that.  I happen to like it also but remember what ever you name him will be with him always.|`|HSlPmlNhaa	What if he ends up liking classical music? What was his band's name? Or how about a favorite rock musician's name? I actually think Rocker would be good as a middle name.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It's okay I guess but still very strange.

In my opinion Zachery is better as Zachary, and Austen Mathew is better as Austin Matthew. If you spell it a way that it's not usually spelled, people will just spell his name wrong all the time and it doesn't make the name more unique or anything.

cEgI5ogLaa	Yes I did when my daughter was 7 months old I found out I was pregnant... argh! We were using condoms and breastfeeding but the condom broke and here I am pregnant with another! You are really fertile right after giving birth for the first 2 months or so and after that your body goes back to normal, but as uncommon as it is it is definitley possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding even if you are not having your period. I would give it a few weeks and if you are still feeling this way take a test for the reassurance. Your body is probably just getting back to normal, but there is always a chance.<br>  Good luck and congrats on your little one.<br>  Toni Lynne :)|`|jkXMKjH6aa	It's different for each person. It never happened for any one I know while they were breastfeeding, but I'm sure there's a chance. Hope everything works out!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yep, it happens all the time.  I am right now and am still breast feeding.  When you are breast feeding every 2 to three hours you are not likely to, but as baby gets older and you start to feed less as a result of solids being introduced and such then you span your time out to every 6 hours or so and that's how it happens.  You body has a chance to allow hormones that allow pregnancy to start working again.  They are subdues while you are actively nursing|`|jcXSNjowaa	My friend got pregnant when her daughter was about 6 months.<br>  <br>  she was breastfeeding<br>  she was on the minipiil<br>  she was not getting periods.<br>  (well so she says)
er7NYdRdaa	My son did the same thing when he first started daycare. He was so used to it just being the two of us at home for 3 months, when he started daycare and was around all that comotion, it just tired him out. He would fall asleep at like 6:30pm every night for two weeks and actually sleep through the whole night. Poor lil guy was so worn out. There are so many new things for him to see, it's just going to take some getting used to.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably just tired from all the new activity; probably will adjust and then will be more normal and interactive when he comes home...|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	in a few weeks he'll be staying up for a couple of hours at a time, could be in the start of a growth spurt.|`|IDmaxViIaa	Well yes its normal he will be tired after daycare thats why he sleeps.

yL9To7Nzaa	omg what is she 12? i would definitely call and have your hubby there as well to discuss it with her. be sure to mention all this during the custody battle, it'll help your case because that woman is CRAZY and a very unfit mother. i'm sorry for you, and i'm sorry for her son. just do your best at being a mom to that boy too b/c he obviously needs it. good luck to you and your family|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yea not to be mean and no offense but your fiance needs to say something to her. Its not your place to say anything and if you did you could just make things worse. I would just tell the little boy that isnt nice and we dont do things like that no matter who tells us what. hope this helps|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I would definantly do something. Try talking to your husband first. Just think what if when the new baby gets here and the 3 yr olds mother tells him to do something mean to his little brother and he seriously hurts your baby unintentionally of course because he is three and wouldn't fully know the consequences of his actions but all the same I think the woman should be beaten for telling him to hit you in the belly. Regardless of how much she may hate or dislike you it's not the poor baby's fault. I think that woman has serious problems and something should be done.|`|7jXChfBNaa	oh girl i would so say something to that biotch! that is terrible i can't believe she would teach him and tell him to do that. i would cuss her out lol and when the baby is born beat her @ss lol. good luck and do whatever your heart tells you to do hun:)|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It's your fiance's place to step in here.

When your fiance is at the custody hearing, make sure he, or his attorney, brings this up.

Does she understand the difference, the health benefits, cleanliness?  My parents waited until my brother was 5 (I am 3 yrs older) and I felt so bad for him to this day for having to go through that once he was old enough to remember.

He'll be in good company if you leave him whole.<br>  <br>  It's difficult for a circumcised dad to admit that leaving his son intact is the right decision, because it means coming to grips with what was taken from you.

After all, when your son grows up and wants to do something stupid, you'll ask him "If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?". Go ahead, reread your question with that in mind!<br>  <br>  There's a lot of research you can do on this topic, I've given some links below. Start with the first three. As the radicals used to say, "if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention".|`|K4zsztkRaa	First of all normal = uncircumcised. Intact is what's normal and it's what's natural.<br>  Also your son doesn't care if his penis looks like yours or not. I don't understand that arguement. Because your penis is going to be much bigger and you are going to have pubic hair, so your penises will always look different. So circumcision isn't going to make you look a like, and again your son isn't going to care. I sure as hell don't care if my penis looks like my dads no offense but that is really creepy.<br>  <br>  Also everyone else doesn't do it, infact it's getting to the point where most people DON'T circumcise their boys anymore. They are realizing there are no medical benifits to it. It's not cleaner, it's nor healthier, it doesn't prevent infections or STD's. Also people are realizing how much sensitivity men lose with circumcision. As a boy who was circumcised as a baby and who has restored his foreskin I can tell you that you lose A LOT of sensitivity when you get circumcised. Studies are now showing about a 40% decrease. (I see a big deal in that)<br>  <br>  Really I would go with your girlfriend on this. The foreskin is a wonderful part of the male anatomy and has a lot of functions. Maybe your girlfriend has been with an uncircumcised male and has felt the difference.<br>  <br>  Uncircumcised is really good for the female too, the foreskin bunches up and acts like a soft ribbed condom feel. <br>  I would leave your son with the equipment he was born with. If he wants to change that then he can as an adult. (and it's not as painful as people make it sound, I know guys who have gotten it done later in life and they all say it's not that bad)<br>  <br>  Do some research on it and think it over. I'm sure you'll find about a million things wrong with the procedure once you find out how painful and psychologicaly dammaging it is to a child.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|7mCCAqXzaa	dr chace if you want him cut just so he can look like you it isnt a good enough reason.

Ray, ?1998<br>  Last Update: 10/19/00<br>  <br>  Some people, for whatever reason, are extremely unwilling to take a good, hard look at this issue. They become annoyed and criticize efforts encouraging them to learn all there is to know about it. Maybe they feel threatened<br>  <br>  “It's a personal choice”, they argue.<br>  -- Without a doubt, discussing genitals is extremely personal.<br>  It’s not a comfortable topic. <br>  <br>  It is obvious by the name alone, Mothers Against Circumcision, that the information presented here will be unbalanced. It cannot be relied upon.   <br>  --     "Actually, the facts about circumcision are unbalanced because the facts are totally against circumcision. The facts do not support the practice. Only myths support the practice. And myths cannot stand against factual information". --George Hill <br>  <br>  “Why should you care? It’s my baby!<br>  You’re just forcing your opinion on us.<br>  Don’t you have anything better to do than run other people's lives?!  I’ll trust my own doctor, thank you very much.”<br>  --  That’s the point.<br>  It’s your baby, not his.<br>  Research it. <br>  <br>  Those who choose circumcision do it with good intentions. Most parents agree to it automatically without much thought, assuming it is the best thing for their child. Although there is a wealth of information out there, many people don't realize that leaving their sons intact is completely safe and totally healthy. What you don’t know can hurt your baby.<br>  <br>  Everyone you’ve discussed it with tells you to do it. Parents who had it done, and many doctors who recommend it vehemently insist that circumcision is the only option. To staunchly defend the routine makes total sense. By accepting the idea that it should stop, a well meaning doctor who has performed the procedure countless times is forced to acknowledge that what he did was not necessary after all. It is more comfortable to remain uneducated about the foreskin, its purpose and its care.<br>  <br>  Parents naturally defend the results of a decision that cannot be undone. Most parents do things they think will protect their children. They do not realize that serious harm can come from circumcision. Some harm usually does occur, although it may not be fully realized until years later. This fact is agonizing to think about. Many people avoid this discomfort by minimizing the procedure. Few would ever want to face that something of value was taken away which can't be replaced. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/Like-Son.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/Like-S...</a><br>     During the late 1800s, when circumcision was introduced to our culture, people believed that masturbation caused a host of different illnesses. [Bullough] [Remondino] It was concluded that by removing the only moveable part of the penis (the foreskin), sensitivity would be reduced and the desire to masturbate would be minimized. Ironically, as it turns out, circumcised men masturbate more than males intact. [Perlman]<br>  <br>         Obviously, most fathers were intact at the time. We were assured the difference between father and son was not a concern. And yet today, one of the most common reasons for circumcision in America is to avoid any difference between them. Routine circumcision has become a purely cosmetic procedure that is totally unnecessary. Many parents think that if they already circumcised their first son, then they have no choice but to circumcise subsequent sons.  Read personal stories of parents who didn't have subsequent sons circumcised.  If you're a parent who has sons with mixed circumcision status, you can enter your own account there too.<br>  <br>         At age 3, my son saw the head of his penis for the very first time. The foreskin had retracted by itself and he discovered it in this condition as he went to the potty. “It’s just like Daddy’s,” he commented immediately, and yet Daddy is circumcised. He is now nearly 5. He has yet to notice that he is different from Daddy. As he gets older, like most kids, he’ll become modest and prefer privacy. I've known of circumcised men who didn't even know until adulthood that their fathers were intact. Some men are unsure as to what their father’s circumcision status is.<br>  <br>         Our offspring receive no physical characteristics that are identical to ours. They are a blend of two different people. A child may have eyes similar to his mother's and a nose like his father's. Why, of all things, are we so obsessed with the notion that the rarely exposed genitals of a father and son must be exactly the same? Until a little boy reaches puberty, this is impossible to achieve anyway. The absence of pubic hair will be just as noticeable, if not more so, than the presence of a foreskin.<br>  <br>         If a boy notices pubic hair or skin missing from his father's penis, each peculiarity can be explained in a way he’ll understand. Do we manage to simplify why our son's and daughter's genital features are not alike? Certainly. Likewise, we can easily clarify any distinctions between father and son. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/whycirc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/whycirc.html</a><br>       "By about 1880 the individual... might wish[to]... tie, chain, or infibulate sexually active children... to adorn them with grotesque appliances, encase them in plaster, leather, or rubber, to frighten or even castrate them... masturbation insanity was now real enough--it was affecting the medical profession." <br>  <br>  (B. Berkeley, quoted from _Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma_, by Rosemary Romberg, Bergin & Garvey Publisher, Inc, S. Hadley MA, USA, 1985, ISBN 089789-073-6)<br>  <br>  Dr. E.J. Spratling, who promoted this surgery by telling his colleagues that "...circumcision is undoubtedly the physician's closest friend and ally..." prescribed in 1895 the method of circumcision as it is practiced in hospitals today.<br>  <br>      "To obtain the best results one must cut away enough skin and mucous membrane to rather put it on the stretch when erections come later. There must be no play in the skin after the wound has thoroughly healed, but it must fit tightly over the penis, for should there be any play the patient will be found to readily resume his practice not begrudging the time and extra energy required to produce the orgasm... We may not be sure that we have done away with the possibility of masturbation, but we may feel confident that we have limited it to within the danger lines." <br>  <br>  (E.J. Spratling, MD. Medical Record, Masturbation in the Adult, vol. 48, no. 13, September 28, 1895, pp. 442-443.)<br>  <br>  Here is an example of what another sexaphobic American doctor had to say about masturbation in 1903:<br>  <br>      "It (self abuse) lays the foundation for consumption, paralysis and heart disease. It weakens the memory, makes a boy careless, negligent and listless. It even makes many lose their minds; others, when grown, commit suicide.... Don't think it does no harm to your boy because he does not suffer now, for the effects of this vice come on so slowly that the victim is often very near death before you realize that he has done himself harm. It is worthy of note that many eminent physicians now advocate the custom of circumcision..." <br>  <br>  (Mary R. Melendy, MD, The Ideal Woman - For Maidens, Wives and Mothers, 1903.)<br>  <br>  (The above material is quoted from J. Bigelow, The Joy of Uncircumcising, Hourglass Book Publishing, Aptos, CA, USA. Thanks to Robin Verner.)<br>  <br>  In America, foreskins were not rare at the time circumcision was introduced into widespread practice. Paradoxically, then, the understanding of the intact male organ at that time was somewhat greater than it is today. (In particular, it never would have been possible to promote circumcision on the basis that it was "necessary for hygienic reasons"---this came later, when doctors themselves were mostly circumcised men.)<br>  <br>  Further, in proposing circumcision as a preventative against self-abuse, physicians of the day understood very well that male masturbation involves stimulation of the foreskin. However they were incorrect in assuming that, by reducing the pleasure, masturbation itself could be reduced or eliminated.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Statistically, nowadays, he'll be more normal if he keeps his foreskin.  It's actually a lot better for him later in life to keep it.  Sex will be better for him.  He'll be more fertile.  And he will be whole.<br>  <br>  I don't have many issues where I go off on a rant but circumcision is one of them.  If it's mutilation to circumcise a girl, it's mutilation to circumcise a boy.  Just because he's a little one right now and won't remember the procedure or the pain--as a parent, you should protect him from traumas like that, and stand up for your child's health and well being above tradition and bullsh*t "norms."<br>  <br>  If he chooses to look like you when he's 18, he can get himself circumcised.  But not giving him a choice is just wrong--even if it is tradition.  Sometimes, traditions are wrong too.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim?

Some evidence suggests the trauma of circumcision has long-term psychological effects.<br>  <br>  There is no care at all for an intact boy.  Just a few important things you need to remember:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seel to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision )<br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The ability to retract it occurs any time up until the end of puberty.  <br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.

Don't make a big deal out of it.  If she feels strongly, let it go.  Later, if your child wants to have it done, he can.  Circumcision can happen at any time for boys, so it doesn't have to be right at birth.  Its not worth an arguement.  Its not irreversible to not have it done.|`|fjTVAbdBaa	Well, I would think normal, would be uncut... because it is natural. There is absolutely no reason to circumsize. But at the same time it is the popular choice to do it. You don't want your child to be different then the other boys, or yourself the father. I totally understand that. On the other end I understand why she wouldn't want to put the baby through that for no reason. It is a tough call, but you guys have to come to that decision together.

xwJGMf93aa	First off, you need to get a second opinion. Your pediatrician is who should have performed the circumcision in the hospital before you took him home. They should have came and talked to you and told you how to care for it and stuff. If they didn't, maybe she accidentally messed it up. If you get it fixed now, it won't be as bad as later. I know a guy that was 23 and had to have his fixed and it was awful.

I know it took a while for my son's skin to kind of retract back. The head would kind of hide, like it was uncircumcised. You have to be sure to keep it clean, but don't mess with the skin. You are not supposed to pull it back or anything. If you are not comfortable with your son's doctor, change them. If you are so concerned about his penis, go see a different doctor, or try to get him in to see a urologist, which is probably totally unnecessary.

They should learn to do chores for their own good and to do good for their family and others. Learn to do things to help themselves and others.

When they don't get anything in return, they do nothing. <br>  <br>  My suggession is to give them a set amount each week or month. That money is a gift from you, to show that you care, and you're helping them. When they look back, they see you as somebody that help you out, so they help you out back.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I think that children should not get paid for doing "regular" chores around the house. I do however feel that they should be paid for doing over and above what they are expected to do. It depends on what they do around the house to make that kind of estimate as to the value of it!|`|4d3Md9pnaa	It's chores. They should help around the house, since their parents pay for the food & what-not.<br>  If for anything, maybe no more than 5-10 bucks a week.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	I have an 11 yr old myself. I pay her according to the job, such as $3 for the kitchen floor to be swept, washed and dried, properly. 50 cents for taking in the garbage can after pick up, she is also not allowed to make money doing things in the house if her own room is not clean, this way she always keeps her room clean and doesn't want to be doing chores for no money, it's a system that really works well. hope this helps.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I don't think a child should be paid to do chores. They live in the home, do we get paid for doing the dishes, um no! If we did I would be a freakin millionaire. They should know from a young age that they live in the household, they should do what ever is necessary to keep it tidy and well kept. I do think they should get some kind of incentive, not necessarily money. Maybe, if they finish all their chores without being asked, they could rent a movie on saturday, or have a friend over for a sleep over. Show them that good behavior and adult like behavior will bring rewards. It'll help them in the long run. For learning the value of a dollar, I think that should be held until they get their first job, when they realize how hard it is to earn that dollar, then they'll truly understand the value of it. <br>  <br>  Edit: I really did like the idea about the extra chores, if say one weekend she wants to go to a movie, then tell her to do something out of the ordinary and a little bit on the though side. Like cleaning out the car, or washing the car if it is warm out. When I was 11, I  knew every saturday was cleaning house day, and I would let my mom know that say, I wanted a friend over, I would have to pull down the curtians and wash them and dry them and hang them back up. Spring cleaning type stuff. I never got an allowence, my parents would judge on how well I did my chores, how good my behavior was that week, and how well I did on one of my test. Then I was allowed to have a little bit of spending money.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	it totally depends on your philosophy.    some parents think that children are members of the household and shoudl contribute as such without expecting reimbursment.  others think that children should be rewarded for their efforts and use this money as a teaching tool, for future money handling skills.   my question is, does your child have any siblings?    i heard a really great idea once, and that was have all the kids sit down and discuss how much each should make in an allowance. (whether chores were required or not)  they talked about things like expenses, and savings.  they then told the parents what they thought a fair amount was for each child. and each number was different based on what they were expected to pay for on their own, age, and other factors.  although most 11 yr olds don't have expenses, i always liked having money for things like candy, going to a movie with a friend etc.   if you really want to teach the value of money, give the child more money with more responsabilities.  for example, instead of $20  give them $100 but they are expected to pay for the ski trip (say $60) and the fee for sports at school ($20) etc.  this teaches them responsability. and then consequenses are truely felt, but not harmful.   my parents gave us money without responsibility.  through jr. high, up until we had jobs my brothers and i were just given money.  i think because i was oldest i got more, and after every birthday it went up a buck or two/ paycheque. (when mom and dad got paid, we got paid)     it didn't hurt us i don't think (it was never enough for us to consider not working durring highschool) but i never learnt anything from it.     i think when my kids are old enough for an allowance, it will be done with chores in mind, although maybe not dependant on them.  i think learning about how to use money wisely is more important than having a made bed.   and because i don't know many people esspecially these days who have money to just throw around, an eleven yr old  doesn't need a ton.  perhaps $11/bi weekly. or a little more if you feel they really need it.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Consider yourself lucky if you get paid to do chores..I was told you live here eat here for free you clean for free lol so if i was 11 and got 5 bucks a week i would have been thrilled|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	I got 5 dollars a week for watching dishes, making my bed, keeping my room clean, and walking the dog at 12...and it was never enough!|`|om0zcFigaa	I got nothing at 11 years old. I thought of it as paying for my room and my food...|`|TlFnIei0aa	$5 - $10 a week, depends on the chores and your income.|`|PgbLkC9Qaa	I dunno, depending on how much they do, maybe 15 bucks a week?|`|AA11738671	It depends what she needs the money for. I personally don't believe in paying a child to do chores; they should do them simply because they are a part of the household and they need to contribute. As a parent, you need to provide for your child, so I think it's better that if your daughter needs something or needs money for something, you give it to her depending on what it is. If it's money for the mall, judge her behavior, attitude, or grades. If it's to buy lunch or clothes, you should already be providing that to her anyway. If she just wants pocket money, again, behavior, attitude, and grades in school should be factors. What chores is she doing? If it's difficult or unusual, like washing your car or doing extra chores she normally shouldn't have to do, then give her extra depending on the amount of work she does. I think $10 a week is more than enough allowance; $20 is good for spending money or special occasions (like school trips and spending money). To me, doing the dishes and cleaning her bedroom are normal chores that she should not get paid for, since she doesn't pay rent or buy food or cook, this is her contribution to the household. At age 11, $5 seems like a lot of money, so don't pay her on the same scale you would an adult.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|PhPD7uAFaa	Nothing ,it is also there responsibilty to make sure the house is clean. Don't make housework a reason to get paid or else they will always expect it. Tell your kids not cleaning is not an option and that you never got paid for doing chores. But when they are finished then you say you did an excellent job by listening and here is some money for obedience. Pay according to what you can afford.|`|zylldvvwaa	I think some chores just need to be expected and then some can be paid, I do think that children these days(including my own) think that $20 dollars is not alot of money. I don't pay mine $20 dollars for anything but I did spend $30 each for good grades. I think it depends on the child and the situation. Good luck!|`|AA10870669	At home as much as he is willing to pay for food, clothing, etc.. while under their parents roof.

azE51WGRaa	If you feel like you aren't pleasing her enough, ask HER what she likes and doesn't like. New relationships are all about figuring each other out and I'm sure it would be better for both of you to just ask her rather than assume.

I believe that having to sleep by 12 is good for you. It's better that you get as much sleep as you can.  Starting early the next day is always a good thing, that way you dont miss out on things.  Besides 12 is pretty late for you if you got school.  Your parents may also be worried about the electric bill too.  I know that that's why my parents wouldn't let me stay up so late because we would have the lights on and other things on and that would higher the electric bills for us.  Just be lucky that while still under their roof, you get to stay up that late because it could be worse.|`|imFOUAMcaa	I am speechless.<br>  I actually have a friend that have strict parents like yours and she is 19 too. what she do is slowly break the rule little by little for instance if she have a midnight curfew than she will come in around 1230.

VKQzj4Pmaa	You do not legally need to tell your baby's father of the birth. Because you are not married to the father, and because he was not at the hospital to sign the birth certificate, his name will not be on it.<br>  <br>  If you ever want to go for child support, he will have to be found by the state and a paternity test will be needed. It has to be proven that he is the father before you receive child support.<br>  <br>  If he ever comes back into your life and if he wants to see his child (have visitation) you can legally deny him visitation until paternity is proven and until he starts paying child support.<br>  <br>  I would encourage you to go for child support, so to make him responsible for his actions. It would be fare for you and your child to receive support.<br>  <br>  It sounds as though he won't be coming around. At least not for a while. Which is good, because you only want that man in your child's life if he wants to be a good and supportive father.|`|FplTPoAyaa	There is no law stating that you must inform the father of when the baby is born.  Your ex sounds like a jerk (no offense).  It is your decision.  If it were me in your situation, I would tell him, because years from now, you will want to be able to tell your child that you did everything in your power to include his/her father in their life.  Just a little advice: be as kind as you can, because the baby will only benefit from parents who get along.  Never badmouth the father in front of the child.  And for goodness sake, go for child support.  Just because you and he are no longer together, and he doesn't want to be very involved in the baby's life, it isn't the baby's fault.  That baby deserves support from both parents, even if it is just financial support.  If you feel like "I don't want his money", that's fine.  Set the support payments aside in a bank account for the baby's future.  If you try to involve him and he doesn't reciprocate, fine.  It is his loss.  Another word of advice: document everything.  Keep a journal of everytime he neglects to visit when he is supposed to, every conversation you have, and every support payment he misses.  You may need written documentation in the future.  Good luck and God bless.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Legally, no you don't. In some states there is a law in place that if the father isn't involved for the first two years his rights are automatically waived, and he can't be involved in the baby's life whatsoever anymore.

Then you may have sore breasts, frequent urination, nausea, fatigue.|`|DwTTt628aa	going the toilet more often,feeling sick, sore boobs when i was pregnant i just knew as i felt different in myself x|`|5pFhnj1Laa	well if u eat something u just feel like trowin up u sleep alot and u r always tired y dont u just make a pregnancy test so u cna come down and dont be thinking things.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	A Missed Period.|`|cYmIMtGOaa	miss period boobs feeling big throwing up or sick to ur stomach smelling thigs very good ect... but remember if u stress alot about missing your period the longer it will take to come so dont stress about it and wait for it|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	A missed period and a positive test. Any other symptoms you might be feeling can be easily attributed to PMS, flu, fear, or wishful thinking.<br>  <br>  If you've missed your period, take a test.

3IQpCzEoaa	I also have the light brown spotting before my period. Sometimes it will be off and on for a week or so, sometimes it happens a day before. Depending on how far along you are, you could be having pregnancy symptoms. Take a home pregnancy test to find out.  It could go either way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Sounds like you may be pregnant.
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I'm assuming you mean 'hurt' and not 'kill'. <br>  <br>  Either way, I don't think that the first time I heard it I would run to a psychologist.  But, I don't think I'd ignore it as a phase, either.  <br>  <br>  Anger, frustration, hurt, whatever was making my child feel like that is a valid emotion that they are going to experience throughout their lives, and that s/he needs to learn to deal with in a way that respects others and also addresses their own right to be happy & lead their lives peacefully.<br>  <br>  So, we'd talk about the emotion, the reason it was there, the reasons why hurting someone was the wrong way to solve it, other better ways to resolve it.  We'd role play.  I'd role model more on the subject.  We'd try out different ways to approach the problem.  I'd certainly watch his/her behavior more closely in those situations, until I knew s/he had a better grasp on it all.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	it depends on the words and the context.  if it was a one off thing.  if there were other things going on that seemed off.  if it was just to a sibling - i'm gonna punch your face in - not nice! and we would be having a chat, but i wouldn't talk him to  doctor at that point.  if i felt he/she was a threat to others even w/out provocation that gut feeling would out weigh anything else.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Find out what the root of the problem is.  Is the other person bullying them, or is there a problem in school, with the parent's relationships?  What is the reasoning behind wanting to hurt someone is the first step to find out.  Then go from there and try to fix the original isues, and explain to the child that ignoring that person is the right thing to do, not hurting them.  Also explain to the child that if they hurt someone, they might get into trouble that you can't fix.<br>  <br>  Communication with the child is essential here.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I'd probably say it's okay to have those feelings, but we don't actually try to hurt people.<br>  <br>   I have a long list of people I'd like to hurt. People who hurt or kill children, men and women who think it's okay to constantly cheat on their spouses, people who are cruel to animals just because they can be. <br>  <br>  Feelings of hate, anger and jealousy are all normal. What's not normal is planning out how to hurt people  or trying to go through with it. That warrants help.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I would find out why my child felt this way.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, kids want to hurt people who have hurt them, whether it's a bully, an abusive teacher, or a friend who has said something unkind.  If this is the case, I would work with my child to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  If this is not the case, I would still see if it was a solvable problem before assuming my child needed professional help.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i won't treat it as a "phase", it is not even something nice to just say it ... i will talk to him to see why he said that, if he just say it because it "sounds cool", i will make sure he stop saying stuffs like that; if i feel he really means it, i will seek psychological help.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	I would firstly ask him why ! My son is 5, and I would be concerned if he expressed something like that to me. I would chat to him, and weigh it up for myself it he needed a councilor or not. <br>  <br>  All little ones get angry, and if their young enough (like my son) they would probably be trying to express their emotions towards another person, but, would not know how to. <br>  <br>  What your child said (if this is your child your referring to ... or if it's a general Q, sorry!) I doubt it was mean as a threat or meant to sound crazy lol I doubt he knew the extent of what he said. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think a councilor or psychologist would be needed.|`|AA11323980	I wouldn't necessarily expect the worst or immediately take them to a psychologist. But sit down with them and ask them why they feel like they want to hurt someone. Perhaps someone is bullying them or they get picked on a lot. Calmly sit down and ask them what has made them feel so hurt that they want to hurt someone? Make sure not to sound defensive or overbearing. Just let them talk. <br>  <br>  Also ask what they mean by hurt someone. Do they mean hit? Beat up? Kill? It's really important to get to the bottom of this.<br>  <br>  If after talking to them you still feel like it's not resolved, then it might be a good idea to seek counseling for them. You could call the kid's school's counselor and ask what they think is the best thing to do. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PTdy6TWRaa	That would depend on their age, what they mean when they say "hurt" and what they understand about it. Little kids don't always use the correct language to articulate their feelings so I wouldn't necessarily rush to any conclusions but would dig deeper to find out what they meant and why.|`|AA11193773	Everybody wants to hurt a person eventually. Think of the person that you dislike the most. Don't you want to hurt them?

723QHuicaa	It contains lemon juice which is acidic, perhaps her skin is sensitive to acidic things.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My son turned really red and eventually broke out in hives after several exposures to peanut/ peanut oil. I took him to the doctor and he had an allergy test, he has not food allergies but has a skin condition called dermographism which is mainly just high levels of histamine in the skin so he gets red easily and breaks out in hives easily to. Just keep an eye on it I think she'll be fine!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	she is allergic to something in it.. but its just a slight allergy.. skin allergies can happen with out being allergic to ingest.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yea, it sounds to me like it is just a skin allergy it probably has something in it that bothers her skin.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Its from the acidity of the tartar sauce is my guess.  There is lemon juice in the tarter sauce, and their are pickles in the tartar sauce, which pickles are made with vinegar.  I wouldn't just assume she is allergic, its probably from the sauce.
avkZGv1taa	I don't think you need medication (although I am not a doctor--you might want to see a psychiatrist).  Based on what you have written, I think you are just sick of being pregnant!  At 41 weeks, you are probably just feeling huge and overwhelmed--and even a month ago, you were probably feeling pretty sick of pregnancy.  I have also had the occasional though of resentment--especially when I had really bad morning sickness, or when my indigestion gets so bad I throw up!  I try to tell myself that it will all be over soon, and it will be so great to hold my baby--but its really hard!  Mind over matter is really easy for them to say!  Just stick in there--your baby will be here soon and all your pregnancy discomforts will go away (aside from that whole month long period business...ick).  Just make sure you have a serious conversation with your hubby about looking out for signs of post-partem depression... even if he thinks you are being ridiculous, at least he will know what to watch for.  Best of luck to you--you are almost there!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Don't worry I think you are fine, just a little tired of being pregnant I am sure, being over due and all. My friend went all the way to 43w4d before she went into labor 1 day before her induction was scheduled, She never dropped until she started feeling the first contractions. Hang in there your baby will be here soon enough!

If it continues and/or gets heavier, you need to call your doctor or get checked out.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|dALaPuXhaa	It can be a few things. First of all, your prenatal vitamins coupled with slowed digestion of pregnancy can constipate you, forcing you to push a little harder to get thins out. It could also be hemorrhoids.

roe07rI8aa	We eat less meat, buy food when it's on special, freeze leftovers and don't eat between meals. I also check out the supermarket discounted shelves for cheap meat (stuff that is about to go out of date) and buy to freeze - that saves loads if you have a good discounting supermarket near you. coupons are good and here in the Uk I usually find the big stores like Tesco take coupons even if you didn't buy the product. we have also downsized on brands and buy supermarket own or no frills brands alot. Eat more pulses too, they work out cheap. markets are good for fruit and veg, eat what's in season and it's pretty cheap. good luck with your moneysaving.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I do my shopping at 3-4 stores. I shop sales at the main grocery stores, I get things like laundry detergent, dish washer soap, toilet paper, etc, at Big Lots. I go to the grocery store mid-week early in the morning and get the cuts of beef from yesterday that have been marked down 20-40%.<br>  <br>  I also use a lot of frozen vegetables. Store brand peas, corn, green beans, carrots, etc. They are a lot cheaper then fresh and you don't have to use them right away which is awesome.<br>  <br>  I love store-brand stuff. And it goes on sale a lot. I was getting great pasta for 33 cents a lb. Day old bread stores are great if your family likes donuts and bagels and of course bread. When your family goes through it quick anyway the day old part isn't a big deal.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I buy things like meat and cheese that I can freeze only when it's on sale. I have a deep freeze and also got a quarter of a cow, it comes out to $2/lb for all different cuts of meat all packaged and cut up. I also stock up on nonperishables such as spaghetti sauce, mac and cheese, noodles, canned soup, when on sale. If nothing I need is on sale I only buy weekly perishable foods like milk, bread, and fruit. Once every couple months I stock up on the sale stuff and spend a good $100-150, each other week our bill is only $25-30 for 3 people.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	good timing lol, i just found a really good site for coupons and free samples yesterday that i have been using.   <a href="http://www.mysavings.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysavings.com/</a>  WELL worth it, its a free site, you just register, then print out what coupons you want and go through the free samples section, within the next 2-10 weeks (it varies by item) i should have a truck load of free samples lol...give it a try, its ALL kinds of every day items, and most of the coupons are a dollar or more off<br>  <br>  <br>  plus we butcher a beef and a hog every fall, so theres out meat for the year....145 dollars for a hog, around 300 usually for a beef, and thats enough meat to last till next fall. if you go buy it by the pack at the store, youre going to be hurting though.|`|prqrQcd1aa	we spend about 100 dollars a week on food for a family of 5.. i use any coupons i can find in the papers for things that i use, i don't have a printer right now or else i'd be looking online for coupons as well! <br>  We definitely buy less..we look at what we need and if we are low on money that week, we don't get things that are not necessary!|`|flqAr30laa	I work for a foodservice warehouse and our discount helps a whole bunch.<br>  I buy meats, cereal, frzn veggies,frz soups, flour, sugar, coffee, tissue paper all in bulk.<br>  We have everything grocery stores have.<br>  and as far as household stuff, I Freecycle alot too, and shop the charity thriftshops.|`|sxecXFgraa	Buy fruits and veggies at your local farmers market.  They're cheaper and most of time, they are organic, they just don't have the "organic stamp of approval" from the FDA.  (The process of becoming a certified organic farmer is costly and most small farmers can't afford it).  If you have room in your yard, start a small garden with the veggies that your family eats the most of.  My family loves tomatoes and cucumbers so I grow them outside in the summer months and I grow them inside in the winter months.  Freeze leftovers so they last longer.  Buy in bulk and use coupons.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Buy generic stuff and stuff on sale and make things from scratch (like make marinara sauce rather than buy jarred sauce).  Usually in each section what you are looking for is always on sale, though it may be the generic kind.  So just go with that one.<br>  <br>  I tried clipping coupons for awhile but it became such a hassle to always get the paper, go through it, then remember to bring coupons and dig through them all to find some for items you need and it didn't save me all that much.  I think coupon clipping has to be well planned out to be effective.<br>  <br>  Also if you have a place like Costco, their generic stuff is pretty good, like their laundry detergent and all, so buy that stuff there and paper towels, etc. - buy it in bulk (you can also buy bulk meat if you have a big freezer and that save s a ton)|`|wphLaVs6aa	We have started saving a lot of money by changing our shopping habits. We go shopping now with a very clear list of what we need for the week. The list is based on a menu that we put together before we leave the house. I've found that developing the menu on the fly at the grocery store led us to buy way more food than we needed. We'd end up throwing a lot of food away at the end of the week.<br>  <br>  I've also found that we're now buying fewer packaged products and making things from scratch more. This saves lots of money. On the weekend, we make two or three great main great dishes from scratch (vegetarian chili, lentil and mushroom soup, parmesean crusted chicken, lasagna, etc.) and eat the leftovers for several meals. This also saves us tons of time during the week.<br>  <br>  Buying less meat saves a lot of money too. We've been using more beans and other proteins (Quinoa is great!) instead of meat, which is quite pricey.<br>  <br>  I've read that if you stay around the perimeter of the store, you'll eat more healthfully and reduce your grocery bill!<br>  <br>  There are several coupon sites, but I've found that we don't buy most of the items that the coupons are for because they're mostly packaged stuff. Not that we don't buy ANY packaged items. The store promos are usually pretty good, though. They include meat, eggs and produce, so I always look at what's on sale at the store.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I admit, I was pretty horrible, when it came to sticking to the grocery budget, but now that my husbands' hours have been cut, I *have* to.<br>  <br>  I found some websites that give advice about cooking from scratch, which saves quite a bit, compared to convenience foods... One I like (and I know it sounds silly) is:<br>  <br>  hillbillyhousewife.com<br>  <br>  Type in menus on a dime, and they have some ebooks, which tell ways of saving money, too.<br>  <br>  I always make a list, and try to stick to it... Without it, you're much more likely to over-spend; tossing unnecessary things in the cart. I also see what weekly (I shop every Friday) specials they have, and try to plan menus around that.<br>  <br>  I make every attempt to keep it *under* budget, so there's a rollover fund, for next week; which helps when there's 'extras,' such as trash bags, paper towels, etc., that suddenly need to be bought... When I find I have more money than usual (thanks to saving, the previous week), I buy more than usual, so there's less to buy, next time... Makes it faster.<br>  <br>  I buy noodles and gravy packets, and meats, and usually we have enough for lunch the next day, which cuts costs... I have 4 kids, so we're a family of 6, and I manage to feed us all on $160 or less, a week. (True, the baby is nursing, but, still!) We also have two cats, two turtles, and 5 dogs!! None of us go hungry... We even had money for extras, before his hours got cut; now we use leftover grocery money, if we need it.<br>  <br>  Buying in bulk can help, and I use powdered milk, at least half the time, which saves on milk costs... Powered milk is great in recipes, too! Pastas are really easy---and fairly cheap---to buy LOTS, and have plenty for another meal.<br>  <br>  We even have take-out, one night a week; using coupons, or having it on their bargain night... We rarely drink pop; we all love water. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I'm not yet a parent, but I am the queen of thrifty shopping, so I can help a bit.<br>  <br>  -I look through all ads that come to my door and will go to a different grocery store if their weekly deals can be used.<br>  -When I do find deals, I stock up.  They had a 39 cent per pound sale on turkey.  You better believe I took up that offer, cooked the bird, and froze the meat for later use.<br>  -I buy bulk products that can be "mixed and matched."  Bargain bags/packages of meat, frozen veggies (or buy fresh and freeze yourself,) and staples like beans, rice, and noodles are cheap, store well, and like said, you can mix and match to make different recipies.<br>  -And yes, I am a coupon master.

zRgPoJtraa	Im not a fan of pink highlights and wouldnt reccomend you getting them because they do look tacky. But if you really want them get them youll still be as smart as ever and theyll show your craziness at the same time|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	If you want to try it, go for it!<br>  If you don't want it to stay in forever, Hot Topic has temporary hair color. It will stay in for a week or so but it's really cool. You should give it a try!|`|AA11296427	The pink will look tacky anyway. Trust me, i have had my hair purple, black, blonde, orange and pink. Streaks, and full head color. It ruins your hair. Go for the natural look ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|BosXJUoFaa	do whatever you want. Dont be afraid to be different|`|szcAWdXKaa	Yea do it...Pink nd Blonde look unreal together...i go pink not highlights more like flashes because they didnt start at the roots because there too hard to keep. only thing wrong is that the clolour washes out even though it is premement in about 3weeks but you can get a bottle of cazy colour and put i over your hole hair it will ony take to th pink thata been done in the hairdressers andit is ver cheap like 3.99 r somthing like that. it doesnt look tacky its all abot personal taste if you like it go for it. i loved mine:D|`|P0YJsg4zaa	no don't do it you will regret it trust me im a hairdresser|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	I think it would look great. But if you're still not sre about it, you could try some semi-permanent highlights to see how it looks. They will only last a few days and will eventually wash out. Good luck! :]|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Do it! I'm a college freshman too, and I'm planning to go bright red. As in BRIGHT red.
zmbeIbx7aa	Yes it is good that you are going to your doctor. You can try bed rest which I know sucks but it is for the health of the baby. You can also try not over doing it like lifting heavy stuff and cleaning to much or exercising or yoga. To much activity can make you spot especially if you have a low lying placenta which is really dangerous both for you and the baby. Your doctor might do an ultrasound to see if it is that or something else. I hope all is well and try to keep off your feet.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	You can't do anything to stop the spotting.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	There is nothing you can do, sorry.|`|K542Db29aa	you need to relax, put your feet up, elevate them and breath!!! stress causes more bleeding and possibly more pain you have to relax! :) of course see your dr soon! try and relax take it easy hold off on sex too just to be safe...good luck to you|`|vygYFdsSaa	The only thing you can do right now is lie down and rest. Don't do anything strenuous. You can go to the ER if you can't wait any longer to go to the dr.|`|C1blHL9vaa	I would say go to the ER if you aren't getting in to see your doctor soon. They will more then likely send you up to the ob/gyn floor to be triaged.|`|UvEt1kzIaa	when i was spotting it was because my blood was trying to fight the baby like anti body would, and to stop that they had to give me a rhogam shot. and it stopped the bleeding. I would ask the doc what your blod type is. Because you might have rh factor, or rh negative like me|`|8N4aPcpaaa	when i was spottin they wanted me to take it easy and lie down with my legs elevated you can try that|`|eGfAXaV3aa	Get plenty of rest...take it easy. Don't be surprised with what your doctor may tell you. All the best.
AA10107400	I used to get the worst coloured poo when I gave the kids chocolate pudding.<br>  <br>  If bubs isn't unwell I'd say just keep an eye on him. Increase his fluid intake just to be on the safe side. Some cool boiled water or some of that nice baby juice that you get. <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like anything to worry about though!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I wouldn't worry, pretty much all poop is normal and no need for concern. <br>  <br>  the only concering colors are white poop and light light gray poop.  <br>  <br>  I bet it was just caused by a combination of foods he ate.|`|qjDxKXENaa	yes it is a bit too much iron... try giving him plenty of water.<br>  <br>  edit... my daughter had the same problem 2 days a go and i was very scared and started panicing because i never seen her doing this and when i took her to doctors, this is what the doctor told me.. plenty of water and her usual milk. avoid anything sugary just for few days.
Hf5doDxsaa	I would send her a card in the mail.  Make sure you put your own words in to it and explain what you were thinking and feeling.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Send flowers with a nice note.|`|v9vrH4Exaa	UHM...<br>  You could stop complaining about your problems on yahoo answers...<br>  Just a suggestion...

Its not wrong to take it away, eventually they should stop using it.  We did not try to take it away ourselves and by a little over five months he was coordinated enough to put it back in himself so its no longer an issue.  You can try to hold out or work on weaning now, its your choice!  <br>  <br>  And as far as damaging teeth and etc, that is not an issue until they are around two years old so don't worry about that.<br>  <br>  Good luck and do what you think is best.|`|zwctZ812aa	I would definitely wait until later, but that is just me.  My son is 4 months and always uses his binky for naps, bedtime, and when he is upset.  Yeah...he spits it out, but it doesn't take too much effort to pop into his room and put it back. 4 months is still really young...sucking is comforting for her, I personally would wait until closer to a year, maybe 9 months, to take away the binky.  It's not hurting anything.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	very very SLOWLY <br>  shes still young and kind of needs it is what it seems <br>  just try and do other stuff with her instead of shoving a  binky in her mouth|`|n6XYYyoLaa	please don't take away the passy for your convenience....they reduce the risk of sids if babies sleep with them, and a lot of babies have a strong urge to suck that isn't satisfied completely by their eating....so they find the sucking a natural way to satisfy that need...soon, he will be able to put it back himself....and you don't have to worry about his teeth for a looong time; he may even ween himself off as he gets older, lots of kids do...my dd uses the 'soothie's and she uses them for sleep mainly now, she's 8 mos or if her teeth are hurting, she gnaws on them (soothies are all one piece, funny looking, but she would never take any other, i highly recommend them!); when she was younger, we used it after feeds, if she was full, she would suck til she was satisfied, then spit it out; if she was still hungry, she would spit it out immediately ( we had to do this bc her need to suck was so strong she would overeat, then throw all the extra back up)....but the older she gets, the less she uses it; now, we have never used it like some do, like popping it in her mouth at every whimper; only when she needed it, sleeptime, feeling bad, etc...so that may make a difference...good luck, and please don't take it away yet, give him a chance to learn to put it back and soon your prob will be solved and he will still have the comfort he obviously craves! hth:0)|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I used pacifiers with both of my kids and they both gave them up willingly around 9 and 10 months old. I think she obviously needs it and can't understand why your taking away something that soothes her. I was a major thumbsucker as a child and my mom took my pacifier away around 6 months. I'd rather have my child use a pacifier that I can take away later than a thumb that I can't! I would wait, if at a year she still has it then take it away! Good luck!|`|Ks7lENScaa	My son is 4 months old also.  My son isn't really that depended on it.  A lot of times I give it to him and he will just spit it right out. I plan on taking it off him around the six month mark unless he takes himself off berore that.  But if you feel he is too depended on it then I would take it from him slowly not just go cold turkey.  Being as he is young maybe he will forget about it and focus on a toy or something.|`|DO0DWnBPaa	When she is good and asleep take it out of her mouth. Let me tell you something if you do decide to let her keep dont worry about it messing up her teeth when she gets them in. my daughter is 11 months old and has 12 teeth, mind you she is also on a pacifier, and dentist said that her teeth are perfectly normal|`|J2glFOkhaa	Nope take it out now. For that reason my children will never use paci's. I used to work in daycare and I had 6 yes SIX children in my 4 year old class who still sucked on one.

I would do it TONIGHT. The first few nights will be the worst of your entire life but I promise it is worth it.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	im going through the same thing .. im going to wait alittle longer and if he does not drop the habit then im going to wean him offf of it|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i would SLOWLY wean her off of it...<br>  i don't see the harm in her having it for another month or two.<br>  but i'm not a mommy, yet! so i can't say i know what i'm talking about.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|4SyYpBChaa	its best to take it off her now as it will ruin her teeth if she carries on using it, it may make you feel guilty but you're doing it for your daughter (:<br>  <br>  x|`|CjySz62Haa	my 3 month old boy never liked pacifier until recent two weeks or so. now i am the same situation you are. he became too dependent on it. i think four months is not early to take it away, i wish I could turn back time and never given it to him.|`|69442f28405cb7b4b2d9ecac676332ceaa	Get her off it.  Try putting a tiny drop of natural lemon juice on it.  The bitter flavor will probably make her push it away.|`|28QPS6V9aa	There's nothing wrong with breaking the habit now, I think the sooner the better. After all, babies don't even need pacifiers. If you get rid of it now it will be much easier then if you wait until she is older. So I say now is the perfect time. However, if you really don't want to get rid of it now if you just wait about a month she should be able to figure out how to put the pacifier in her mouth by herself, which would eliminate the problems you're having. By five months my daughter was putting her pacifier in her mouth herself and we plan on getting rid of them the day she starts walking.
8HQwcstIaa	Hello =)<br>  <br>  When it comes to ovulation, it is important that you understand that ovulation NORMALLY occurs 14 days before your next period.  For a woman with a 28-day cycle, that would be around day 14.  However, for a woman who has a 34-day cycle, it could be more like day 20.  That six days can make a huge difference!<br>  <br>  Also, you ovulate ONCE per cycle.  It happens and that's it.  So you don't really ovulate for a period of time.  Sperm can, however, survive for 3-5 days.  So have sex every day or every other day for the 3-5 days before ovulation (and the day of) and you should have your bases covered!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5kGcNCAjaa	okay hello,First you ov 14 days after the first day of your period well most women and then you should be fertile for 3-4 days then the day after you ov , get First response to see when you are most fertile it works then ,you ov for 24 hours i think i think !!! but you should try for the day before ,the day of ov and the day after|`|Er3imE5Yaa	i think you have at least 24 or 42 hours to baby dance during your ovulating period.  To make things more easier try taking ovulating tests and go from there.

JjBwydymaa	oo hunni.. how fustrated must you be!!<br>  <br>  But a delayed/missed period can be caused by other things such as stress, depression, if you overweight/underweight! If you havnt had a very good diet or you exercising loads..<br>  <br>  But saying that...you may still be pregnant but your HCG levels arent strong enough to be picked up in a urine test.

Go for George, its traditional. You cant go wrong
hKJIDdVqaa	No, I do not. I do not ground as punishment.  I believe it is senseless. Besides that restricting my children to their rooms would be the closet they can get to heaven for now.  Video games, PSP's Nintendo DS, Wii, toys, TV.  This is hardly a fitting punishment.  I am more of a lecturer.  That is the most torturous punishment for my children. I cannot tell you how much they love to hear why they did wrong, and how they will not do it again.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	My parents don't ground. <br>  IT doesn't do anything. <br>  They try a few times and when I get that thing back I go back to exactly what I was doing before, like most teenagers after they are done getting grounded they are just more "careful" about it.<br>  I also think taking away possessions is pointless. T.V. is the most pointless. But when kids are sent to their rooms for MONTHS that's horrible. Its like a dogs cage, thats their room, they don't wanna be afraid of their room.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Grounding is a perfectly acceptible and good punishment for severe behaviour.  No, they don't get kept in thier room, but they lose everyting, not just one thing.  They can NOT talk on the phone, visit friends, use a computer (unless it is homework), watch t.v, they can read because I would never take that away for anything.  They spend their time at school and at home, they do homework, chores and read...that is it.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	I don't ground and I won't. i know much better things to do with a child/teen who has their own opinion and doesn't want to do what someone else orders them. Talking with them? Discussing? Ever heard of communication with the child? It's written in the constitution of America - you can't punish anyone and you can't humiliate anyone. At least do it with adults, not with kids.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	I agree with you. I don't use their rooms as prisons or places of banishment. I think if I did that it would become difficult to get them to go to sleep at night or play in their rooms as they'd grow to think of those places negatively. I prefer going with natural consequences too.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	No that's too much, they don't even do that to murderers, even they are entitled to some form of stimulation even if it's only an hour exercise a day.<br>  <br>  Grounding is the same as hitting, you can't think of an intelligent response so they lose their anger and take it out on the child, it teaches nothing.<br>  <br>  Parents say that spending several hours a day watching telly is unhealthy due to not socializing and lack of exercise and stimulation, but no keeping them in that state for weeks or even months does nothing.<br>  <br>  Most of the time it's just the parent with their head up their @ss punishing the child for an argument or disagreement.|`|Wm3GDO9jaa	Well, I'm an 18 year old and I can say that my parents have done a wonderful job raising me. I am the first to go to college because they worked hard to make sure it happened. <br>  My curfew is midnight. The first time I'm late, I get a warning. The second time, my parents take away an hour. So I would need to be home that weekend at 10 or 11 instead.<br>  Same with my mom. Whenever I go over on my text or I do something stupid (which I would never do) my parents take my phone away.<br>  At the same time, in today's society, a teen's life revolves around their phone, car, televison, computer, etc.. When my dad took away my television, I watched things on the computer. When I wasn't allowed out, I talked on the cell phone all night. <br>  I personally think that a teen these days need to actually learn what they are doing wrong. Instead usually a punishment consists of trying to find a way around it.
HCmAoNjzaa	I just had one Dec. 22 and it wasn't pleasant by any means but it was worth it for the peace of mind that I didn't (Thank the Lord) have any blockage. As far as a pain scale # i would give it maybe a 7. It was painful and I cried while laying there on the table (which was embarrassing) it wasn't just the pain that got to me it was fear of a blockage, the vulnerability of just laying there while they do this to you & the pain on top of it. The pain only lasted maybe 3 minutes. It was worth it though. I got my results immediately while I was still laying there on the table.<br>  <br>  I really don't know about any studies on what type of contrast.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i have had one & i have never cramped so bad in my life, sorry i know this is not what you want to hear but i don't want to mislead you.  i think it hurt so bad because i knew of someone that said she had it done & it didn't hurt at all, she had so much blockage it never entered her tubes.  so i was expecting no pain.  the procedure itself isn't too bad it's just when you get up.  it may have hurt more also because i did have a cyst the size of a nickel on one of my tubes.  later when i went to have a laparoscopic procedure it had gotten as big as a navel orange.<br>  i tend to try & think the worse so that i am usually suprised at how it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.<br>  i didn't even know that there was a different type of dye they can use.  maybe someone else can answer this one for you|`|NT49I5KYaa	I had one a couple of months ago.  It does cause cramping which can be minimized by taking some ibuprofen prior to procedure.  They first come in and inject you with some lidocaine inside (i believe they are injecting your cervix).  This feels a lot like a bee sting but only lasts for less than a minute.  Then you will feel some "ringing" in your ears which I was told was perfectly normal.  They then inject you with the die (you do not feel a thing that this point) They look at the xray and you are done. The whole thing lasts about 5-10 minutes.  After that you WILL feel cramping for about 30-45 minutes.  It goes away and honestly not totally horrible.  If you have had children before I am sure you will find THIS is minor in comparison.  <br>  <br>  As for the oil/water base part of your question I don't think the test has any bearing on the increase or decrease of pregnancy it is only a test and not a treatment.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and truely you will find you are fretting over nothing...:)
2LB3bWdpaa	Rose Elizabeth Bailey - it's a nice classic name, however it almost makes me think of an old lady.<br>  (my grandmother's name is Rosalee so kind of reminds me of her)<br>  <br>  Claire Sofia Bailey- Another classic name. It's pretty and Claire is something you don't hear that often.<br>  <br>  Jade Helena Bailey- Jade wouldn't be a name I'd expect to see with this sib-set. However, Jade is my favorite of all the first names. I don't like how Jade Helena flows so well but overall it is a nice name.<br>  <br>  Dawn Gabriella Bailey- Whenever I hear the name Dawn I think of 2 things: the girl from the Babysitter's Club books (I read all of them as a pre-teen lol) and my best friend's drunk aunt! Dawn isn't a bad name, it just reminds me of those things. I do love Gabriella though. I think Gabriella Dawn would have been better but overall, all of your names are nice.|`|541ni2a9aa	Rose is a very nice name, elizabeth is a little too common for my taste.<br>  <br>  Claire is a nice name, still a little common though. Sofia I love<br>  <br>  Jade, I love.. Helena i am not too sure they go together<br>  <br>  Dawn is a nice name, very hippie. Gabriella is very pretty but once again i dont think the two go together.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Rose Elizabeth Bailey- 7/10<br>  <br>  Claire Sofia Bailey- 6/10<br>  <br>  Jade Helena Bailey- 8/10<br>  <br>  Dawn Gabriella Bailey- 5/10|`|AA10431660	Very pretty and elegant name<br>  Nice middle name of sofia<br>  Not too keen on the combination but i love the name Helena<br>  Very nice name<br>  <br>  I think the best combination i like the most is: Claire Sofia|`|SGnWerbYaa	I like all these names!! They all go together well and go with the surname!!!! They are also names that can carry you throughout your lives which is also important!!|`|H7GtXRqGaa	well chosen names although not all to my personal taste I particularly like Jade Helena combo|`|e76k5edZaa	There a bit two traditional, but there okay :)<br>  I like Dawn Gabriella the best<br>  <br>  <br>  ???|`|xq4qXtg9aa	Your names are so nice, really classy, and not too old fashioned, I love them your parents have really good taste lol!!!|`|NE1HzlE8aa	I like all of them<br>  they are very unique and one of them is my name!<br>  that's all that counts =]|`|AA10972821	I really like Claire Sofia.  It sounds good together.|`|8SMLOPvuaa	i like them x|`|jxg88KqFaa	Quite classy, very nice|`|Y07zLuaKaa	I LOVE old fashioned names! Yours is my favourite (I'm naming my daughter Rose), and I don't personally like any of the other first names but I love Sofia and Helena. <br>  However, don't be offended because although it's easy to judge names on a page, it's really a person that makes the name. A person could have the most beautiful name and it doesn't make them a more attractive person. <br>  Amber Francesca x|`|8dhe15MUaa	hi very nice names like them a lot|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I like how you have the pattern of one syllable first names, but I think I would have made all your middle names end in A, instead of just three of you. Overall I think you all have really pretty names. It's nice to see some pretty but simple names.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	i love rose elizabeth- so classy and elegant<br>  claire sofia is lovely but i prefer sofia spelt sophia<br>  i love the name jade and helena is nice too<br>  dawn gabriella is sweet|`|SfwLF8j2aa	1. pretty<br>  2. love sofia<br>  3. ok<br>  4. Dawn is my name:)|`|OHfZFR31aa	Very pretty names.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	I like:<br>  <br>  Rose - so gorgeous as a first name!<br>  Claire - pretty<br>  Sofia - love this spelling...it's so popular now though :(<br>  Helena - knew the cutest little girl with this name!|`|claUGpVRaa	I like all your names. They all sound very classy and go well together.<br>  Be thankful your parents were not morons and named you all stupid names that would get you teased!|`|KmC0K59taa	They are ok.  I don't care for Dawn.  That's just me.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	i like rose elizabeth, but not the others|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love:<br>  <br>  Sofia<br>  Gabriella<br>  Rose|`|UdCpB5loaa	I like Rose and Claire Sofia|`|pOekC2Sqaa	They're all stunning!! <br>  <br>  G2B|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Old fashioned but classy i guess. =)
KbcbAKi4aa	I didn't know with my first. I really wanted a boy to protect future children and I got my boy! Emotions where the same and I carried the same with #2 so I knew he was a boy. My third baby I felt all around different from the second I got a positive test.I was moodier, didn't feel like crying at all like with the boys and carried wider. And lastly, with my fourth and current, again, based on mood and weight placement I knew she was definately a little girl. And she is!!! I think that you should go with your intuition but also compare this pregnancy to the last. Hopefully the two ideas match! Good luck! You could always have one more if this one isn't a girl... I would've had 10 boys in order to have my little girl!!! LOL!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes! I was so convinced I was having a girl I bought all pink clothes and only picked out girls names :) I was right :)|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I already have a son and a daughter but had a really strong feeling that this time I was having a boy.  I convinced myself so much that I began thinking that I may actually be surprised and have another daughter instead.  Even a 'psychic' told me it was a girl.  However 2 days before my gender scan I mentioned to my partner that for some reason I still thought it would be a boy and I was right!  My little man is due on July 1st =)|`|uuHPneEcaa	I thought I was having a girl, I would have all these dreams that it was a girl and i had my mind set on it. But when I was 19 weeks I heard the words "Its a boy!" and I was still happy about it and i didn't care what i was having as long as he or she was healthy . So they are some people who can feel what they are having some can't I guess my  Intuition was wrong.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I havent a clue what mine will be yet and im hoping i wont find out until they get here (June 5th) but my soon to be mother in law guessed with all her children and grandchildren and so far every single one has been opposite of what her guess was so ive been trying not to listen to her about it because im afraid if she says boys theyll be girls, and vice versa. but there could always be one of each so itll be a win win no matter what i guess|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	YES! i knew from the very moment that i found out i was pregnant that i was having a boy...<br>  <br>  i just wanted a boy so badly<br>  <br>  i was right!!!!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	My instincts were wrong. I was convinced I was having a boy with the symptoms I had and my gut feelings just told me. Plus I had dreamt of having a son! I ended up having a beautiful little girl!|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Yes but only with my first. I knew right from the time that I had found out that I was pregnant that I was having a little boy. There was no doubt in my mind that it was a boy. Everyone told me that I was carrying girl. At 17 weeks I had my ultrasound and I was right it was a little boy. I am now due with my second on March 30 and I had no clue what the sex was not even a guess. So I got an ultrasound at 23 weeks and it is a girl.|`|oyK7FGynaa	From the day I found out I was pregnant I knew it was a boy. I could just feel it, and the last 6 babies that were born in my family were girls so I could feel he was going to be different, and I was totally right. Nobody believed me, but I believed in him and we ended up proving everyone wrong.|`|qicxk5GMaa	I don't know how people actually know but I had a feeling I was having a girl and I am.  I think the only reason is that growing up, whenever I pictured myself having a baby it was always a girl that I'd picture.  Then after hearing all the wifes tales about morning sickness, carrying high or low, babys heart rate... they all pointed to a girl.|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	Yup!!! I felt I was having a boy when i was about 4 weeks pregnant. And when I was 14 weeks, I went to the doctor and he said it looks like a boy... it was completely confirmed when I was 19 weeks. And he is growing big and strong.. I might have a basketball player in my belly... He has long legs.. =)|`|ew0FaElzaa	I wanted a girl so badly just because of all the cute baby clothes. I was having a boy though, that I knew just because I wanted a girl, I knew I wasn't getting one lol. And now 39 weeks later my pokey little stinker (I say that due to 3 weeks of prodromal labor) is almost due!|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i convinced myself i was having a boy but deep down i knew i was having a girl, like you i already have a boy and wanted a girl, and sure enough i was told at my 20 week scan im having a girl and confirmed with a 4d scan at 30 weeks|`|q4WtQvSZaa	I did!  I was sure from the beginning it was a boy, and I was right.  My partner was equally sure I was having a girl though, so one of us had to be right!|`|rh5HjBJbaa	With my first, I think I willed him to be a boy. I always had wanted a son first and then a daughter. I know that in all actuality I had no say in it, but when I found out I was pregnant the first time, the baby was always a boy to me. This time, I knew I wanted a girl a tiny bit more, but I had no idea. Still, even after having two sonagrams, I'm hesitant to fully commit to the idea of a girl. I hope they were right though! :)|`|W1vtwQxVaa	I am currently pregnant with my 8th baby and have NEVER had any inklings or intuitions!!!  My first 5 were boys and when I had my 6th I just presumed it would be a boy (and was very happy) even the consultants in the hospital said it would most likely be a boy so everyone was shocked when I had a girl!  We laughed so much when the midwife showed us!  Anyway my 7th was a boy and I have no idea what I am carrying right now but I don't know if thats because I have honestly never minded what I had I just wanted a baby.|`|e33QAXShaa	Oddly enough with my 1st I had no doubt she was a girl. I was young and naive but no doubt in my mind I was having a girl. Matter of fact my 1st gender u/s they said boy and I made them reschedule it and sure enough GIRL! 2nd was twins and I really wasn't sure with them, 3rd was a boy and I kinda thought it was because I was barely sick with him or the twins (all boys). This time around I'm thinking another girl because I was sicks through 18wks like my daughter and weight gain has been very slow like with her as well. I'm not 110% sure like with her though. We find out Monday!!|`|wr78BCGAaa	when i was pregnant with my 2 boys, both times i got really hairy all over my body, plus the hair on my head was really nice and thick...<br>  then when i was pregnant with my 2 girls, i didn't grow extra body hair and the hair on my head turned to crap.<br>  <br>  i also got more headaches with my girls...<br>  <br>  and the baby's heart beats were less than 150 with my boys.. and more than 150bpm with my girls atmy first prenatal visit... the heartbeat theory is correct for most people, but only in the first trimester.|`|8N4aPcpaaa	so i knew from the beginnin i was havin a girl then i kept havin these dreams it was a boy so i was like hmmm i still thought it was girl then i had a dream i was showin my cuzn my baby the baby was in a pink blanket and had on a pink hat i handed the baby over to someone else who said what a cute baby and undressed it and the baby had a wee wee lol i was apalled by that dream but it turns out i am havin a girl though|`|DwTTt628aa	hi some people say the size of your bump if its all front its a girl and what you crave has something to do with it sweet stuff girl savory stuff boy but it depends really i thought i was having a girl cos i craved sweets but i had a boy, only the scn can really tell hope it goes the way you want|`|AA12395149	I just KNEW it was a girl...until a few ultrasounds told me otherwise!  But I still have dreams that I'm having a girl.  We'll see in a few weeks, but it seemed pretty obvious it was a boy, saw both the beans and frank.|`|oXCo6VX4aa	Yes, I really really wanted a girl but I knew in my heart that I was having a boy.  I found out I was right at 19 weeks.  We're just as excited now to meet our son but I'll be honest, it took me a little bit of time to get over the disappointment.  :)|`|17bfd1e6b60c4854e381d6c4734753b4aa	I wasn't for sure but I was right. It was a boy. I think you can tell alot by how you carry a baby and the way your body adapts to it. This is my opinion and I soley believe it. Good luck|`|My93XR2Maa	i wont it a boy bt i though i was havin girl but the time come to find out wat i was havin an come out that i was having a boy i got wat i wonted|`|PhcwFBFTaa	Iv'e never had the experience, but apparently, if your bump is hanging, it's a boy and if the bump is carried well, it's a girl!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I really wanted a girl when I was preggers, but I just knew in the back of my mind that he was a little boy and I was right! Maybe just a good guess or mothers intuition?? Who knows|`|E6obQSpraa	I didnt know till about 5 months into it.  From then on i just knew he was a boy.  Dont know how, but i did!  Didnt pick any girls names, just boys.|`|9S3Phnf2aa	I was so certain that I was having a girl, and I was blown away at the ultra sound when I found out I was wrong! Good luck though :)!|`|hameOvsyaa	Yup, I kept having dreams that it was a boy a boy and when I went for an ultrasound I was right!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I think I am having a boy. I find out in four weeks, but I only picked out boy names so far. And I call my baby a him. =]
h57t7FAjaa	I love "boyish" names on girls as well.  I want to name my daughter Taylor Brynn :) (Btw Rowan Olivia is gorgeous)<br>  <br>  I think Devyn Grace is very cute... I knew a few little girls named Devyn when I was growing up, and i've always liked that name for a little girl!  Finley & Charlee are cute too, but I definitely like Devyn the best.<br>  <br>  For boys I love love Landon and Rylan!<br>  If I have a boy his name will be Landon Cole.<br>  I also liked Rylan James, but my fiance hates that name :(<br>  <br>  Declan & Daxton aren't bad, but I knew a Declan growing up I didn't like so maybe thats why it's not a favorite... & I just don't like the way Daxton sounds for a name.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck in your decision! :)|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I also like "masculine" names for girls but my favourites are not up there.  I think that Finley Grace is the nicest out of them.  What about Elliot Grace? or Aiden Grace? or Cameron? or maybe even Morgan? <br>  <br>  Out of your boys I think I like Declan Gerald the best. <br>  <br>  Hope that I've helped :)|`|9c9kZePHaa	Rylan Gerald is adorable, and I absoutely LOVE the name Devyn Grace. Congrats to you and your family!|`|V8JoRHnnaa	Charlee Grace<br>  Rylan Gerald|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	1. Rowan olivia is beautiful!<br>  2.Don't worry about others, it's your kids!<br>  3.I dislike Charlee, sorry.<br>  4.Finley Grace/Landon Gerald are my faves.Devyn/Declan are also faves of mines.Good Job and Good Luck!|`|9n0NrReyaa	Finley Grace is a beautiful name for a little girl, and I personaly like Declan or Rylan for the boy.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a happy pregnancy!!|`|LU96bnCdaa	For girls what about Charlee Nicole...that is my cousin's name! =]<br>  <br>  For boys Landon Gerald. <br>  <br>  Pretty names by the way!!!!<br>  =]|`|9PUW480Eaa	I like Charlee Grace.... and I think Declan is a strong, fantastic, manly name..... the same one that I chose for my wee boy!  He certainly has charm and good looks! Good Luck!|`|hlztyMYyaa	Rylan Gerald|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I really like Charlee for a girl. I think that is so cute and spunky! I love it.|`|ePZi2zPGaa	Charlee Grace for sure.<br>  Daxton Gerald.|`|5XVzpmP0aa	charlee grace and declan gerald is the nicest.|`|VHHis05Naa	All boys names.<br>  <br>  Go with Ainsley.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I think Charlotte Grace is gorgeous, with a nickname of Charlee when she is younger. But I honestly wouldn't want to be known by a cutsey name like Charlee when I was in my 30s<br>  <br>  Finley, Devyn and Ainslee all sound way too masculine, no matter how they are spelled.<br>  <br>  Declan Gerald is great. I love the name Declan.
yV8fog7Paa	I was held back in the 6th grade because the elementary school could never teach me properly the way I was taught best, so I was held back and my grades improved dramatically. I had no motivation either, I came home and did my homework last minute then failed the assignment. I had no passing grades in elementary school, Once I was held back my grades went from D's and F's and the occasional C's to A's and B's and rarely C's. <br>  <br>  Hold her back. If she still has no motivation tell her if you fail classes this year or get lower than a 70 you'll hold her back again or make her repeat the class she failed in if it was only one class. <br>  <br>  My brother now, we are both in 10th grade, was never held back (he's adopted) and he has no motivation. He is barely passing his classes and dad is like "it's ok, as long as you didn't get a zero" and if I get a 70 or something dad is like "you've got to try harder next time" even with the 80, or 85. I like it actually. I feel sorry for my brother.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I don't think holding her back would make her want to try harder. If anything it might make her totally give up because she'd feel like a baby.<br>  <br>  Maybe try a different kind of school for her. Get her a tutor. Try new things.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	no, do not do that.|`|FiUprYsvaa	No, no and no!<br>  <br>  My mom made the decision to hold me back in 6th grade and I wasn't able to go on to 7th. I was like your daughter, I didn't do well in school but when I took assesment testing I was above average, my mom kept me back anyways. <br>  <br>  It screwed me up. <br>  I didn't mature on time. I acted immature because I was with younger people. It embarrassed me because I was older. <br>  It really stunted me. <br>  <br>  Let her go onto high school and once she is faced with the possibility of the school holding her back and no way of talking her self out of that one, she'll starighten up real quick. <br>  <br>  Don't hold her back. <br>  If she passes her classes but they are C's or D's let her pass, if she fails and they still pass her let her go on to high school.|`|sAN0IDOeaa	you would be a total ***** to do that if the school is allowing her to go on. if you want to reward her, do so with money. shes too young to make money really so give her money for every A she receives or something.|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	She will HATE you for it.<br>  HATE YOU.<br>  How are her marks? If they aren't bad but you're just being anal and want them better, just relax.|`|ifCMP0dnaa	At the most fundamental level, your job is to prepare your daughter to be a functioning member of society. That includes being prepared educationally. If your daughter has not learned what she needs to have learned by the time 9th grade starts, she needs to remain in 8th grade until she has learned what she needs to have learned.<br>  <br>  Expect a lot of complaints though. Nobody likes being held back. She will have a hard time socially, but in the end it may be in her best interest.|`|oHNsAcInaa	Advice coming from a 16 year old.<br>  <br>  Don't do it. Talk to her, make her a guidance appointment. Do everything you can not to hold her back . If shes not doing any better it might be best to hold her back.Warn her first.|`|TYQOafA8aa	Gee, why don't you lock her in the dungeon instead? if she she is doing bad but she passed her exams and she's granted to move on to 9th grade it would be cruel from you to hold her back.|`|L1CC5DNPaa	she will literally hate you for it. When all her friends are graduating and going to prob. and shell be stuck with kids younger than her. You should think and talk to her about this before you make your mind up|`|J9Vmueauaa	I think you should, but if you do, put her in a different school so she won't be embarrassed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227093317AAalW97&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lTsPX04jaa	no. totally no. this would really mess her up. she is already with her graduating class|`|5LAqZUyVaa	my sister got held back it didnt help her because she had no friends and was mad and  she was also having a baby and that scared the other kids and she was mean to the kids that year and my sister was only 12-13 years old and the boy she had sex with saw 16-17 years old so she had sex cause she got held back so i wouldnt hold ur kid back
WPI0Z47saa	I got pregnant the month after I stopped the pill and I was on it for 9 years.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Keep trying. It can take up to a year for a healthy couple to get pregnant. I was on loestrin 24 and was pregnant instantly after stopping it so that's likely not the problem.|`|fTd509Qzaa	all you can do is wait.  Birth control wears off as soon as you stop taking it.  It prevents you from ovulating.  You have had 2 periods since you went off, which means you have ovulated twice.  <br>  this could be a mental thing.  Happened to me.  i was 2 weeks late, 5 hpts later, all negative, i got my period.<br>  Call your dr. for a blood test or wait till you are a month late and go in.  Until then, I would test every week until you start, just to be sure|`|sRy2SKpXaa	When I stopped taking my birth control pills I got pregnant right away, like not even joking. I didn't have a period or anything. But it all depends on each woman and it's different for everybody. Good luck.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	Sometimes it take a few months for your body to regulate itself after getting off birth control! Give it a little time! You use so many exclamation marks!|`|t0K6Haoyaa	It just depends on your body! It could take up to 6 months to get out of your system. You need to talk to your doctor for a more accurate answer.|`|ssXnhkn8aa	My mom was on birthcontrol && as soon as she stopped taking it she got pregnant. She told my father lets have a baby && well they did.
AA12228565	Go to the doctor and have a blood test done.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Go to the doctors and get a blood test. It will tell you an accurate result.|`|UaL28atDaa	Its still quite early to tell its usually about 3-4weeks when you get an accurate result.<br>  <br>  Take a look at this video it will let you know what to look out for in terms of the earliest pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100090/Pregnancy_Weeks_1_to_4_Month_1?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a>|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you are really thinking that you are then make an appointment with your doctor and request a blood test be done and have your doctor check to see what could be causing you to be so darn late. Good luck!|`|FDgarm4Zaa	the only way to know if you are really pregnant is to go to the doctor. sometimes pregnancy tests can be wrong.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, you should wait another week and test again.  Did you use your first morning urine?|`|85dnSnVAaa	it shouldnt be like that dont worry wait for couple of more days and if you are still not satisfied check with doctor please.<br>  <br>  also i can suggest you to visit following site where you can get more hints.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|ZgprgA1Naa	Yes maybe.  Anything could cause your period to be late.  If you are taking birth control pills inconsistently.  The best thing is to go to the doctor.  If you do not have insurance go to the health department.|`|gIvau2Fzaa	Blood test the best method to confirm if your pregnant or not.
5ORyLk4Uaa	it can take up to a year for the average couple. the best bet is to have sex every other day. this way the sperm is ready and full. you would have to chart your ovulation times to figure out your date. i ovulate a week before my period so going by the average woman is not always accurate. using ovulation tests help too. good luck|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	No hun, you most liketly ovulate aroudn day 14 of your cycle.. that is the 14th day after the START of your period... your most fertile days are between days 11-17. <br>  <br>  After your husband "finishes", prop your legs up for a few minutes and sit there instead of just getting up and letting everything come out right away... and dont' go pee right after if you can help it because urine is a natural spermicide.|`|IUxTxJqDaa	My husband & I weren't actually *planning* this pregnancy, but we weren't preventing it either!  I know for a fact though, that he did his business inside of me twice around the time I was ovulating mid-month and now Im pregnant!  lol.

Worked for me both times.|`|nd18Ssvpaa	fertility treatments worked for me|`|H5QmXKm1aa	It took me and my husband about 15 minutes and i had quads 3 girls and one boy!|`|3G1KwlOdaa	Do him every other day.  You need to give him time to get his sperm count upl  Just once, in this timeframe, is adequate.|`|eHxNxbWKaa	the days ur most fertile is two weeks after the 1st day of ur period just stick to that u'll be preg in no time!!!|`|AwJNdr5Maa	Ya your prob sterile
