20090307030634AAFL10c	Computers & Internet;Internet;MSN	Someone hacked into my webcam last night on MSN - help!?	Ok, so my friend invited her "boyfriend" (who lives in America) into our conversation last night on MSN and we got talking. He added me to his contact list and so I accepted (I trusted him since my friend has been going out with him for ages, even though they have never actually met in person). Then my friend left the conversation and so it was just me and her boyfriend. We made small talk for a while but we never went on webcam.      Here's the dodgey bit: I took a sip from my can of Pepsi, which I had never told him I had, and he said this -      Him:   drink pop   Him:   =O   Me:   what the hell..?   Him:   coca-ola?   Him:   cola*   Me:   what..   Him:   >. .<   Him:   drink soda?   Him:   pepsi      That was our conversation (I changed the names to 'Me' and 'Him') - can you tell why I would be freaked out?   I didn't tell him once that I had a can of pepsi and it was exactly at the same time that I was drinking it that he said that.   I didn't have an anti-virus then (I know, completely stupid!) but I have just downloaded AVG, will that be enough to stop hackers like him? If it's not what else can I download?   Obviously I blocked him and am planning on warning my friend about him ASAP.      But now he's hacked into my webcam once, can he hack into it even when I'm not on msn and watch me? I've put something over my webcam for now but I'd rather not have to keep it there all the time.      Oh and by the way, I'm 15 but I do know the risks of online messaging. I never give out any personal information to people I don't know and never will, and I don't usually add people I don't know. So if you're going to answer this question to give me a huge lecture on how bad it is to add people you don't know and the dangers of it all, please don't. You would only make me feel worse...      Thanks!

20090307014731AAbKSDM	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	OpenSolaris Box w/sound?	Hass anyone found a good mobo, desktop, or laptop for running Opensolaris. I have an old toshiba satelite celeron 1.8 that runs it great, but its really slow and old (needs major repairs due to failing hardware causing major slow downs). But my question is really what systems you've been able to get it working on, specifically sound. I have a decent desktop that it runs on but sound is unstable and I had to put a seperate intel e1000 nic in it(didn't like my via nic or via sound(worked at first but fails after first reboot)). I saw their is sparcs release but my sparcs systems won't boot the cdrom for some reason.      So in addition has anyone had any luck with getting opensolaris on a UltraSparc or Sun Blade. Maybe a a sound card that works (I know where the compaitiblity list is, please don't post it) *not a chipset.*       Also is it common to have the white screen come up on restart or shutdown, I thought that was a openprom thing, why is it showing a white screen on a pc? Why is it so slow on a PC. Is it just my cheap hardware has anyone had any good experience with running solaris/opensolaris on x86 or x86_64 hardware?

It said i don't have except 5 MB of free space, so  i deleted almost ALL the documents i have (music , photos) and deleted them from the recycle bin. As  i know i deleted more than 2 GB, but still the computer says it is low on disk space. Being angry with my computer xD i shut it down. I have 6 accounts on my computer (all mine muahha), and while i was openin an account called ir (an account i been having for 2 years) it openend a whole new account, just as if i have made a new account. The desktop was empty, and only the internet explorer, and my computer and my documents and the recycle bin were there. I was afraid i could have lost the documents i have, so i went to my computer and to the Documents and setting, and found the "ir" folder, but there was another folder called ir.HOME-3EC19CA787 . This was the one that i have been on. The other folder "ir" has all my documents and stuff.  So i thought it was a problem with the "ir" account.   So i logged on to another account, the exact same thing happened. Now i have 4 ir folders, and 4 doliza (the other account's name) folders.   I went to th control panel, and deleted all my accounts (keeping the folders and leaving "ir" and "doliza") . The wierd thing is that i only have the 2 main accounts, but they are just not opening. I tried changing the password but it didn't work. Everytime i log on to my computer, write the name of the account, and the password, it opens a totally new fresh account.   I have over 12 accounts right now. But only 2 in the control panel.   I tried the system restore, ofcourse it didn;t work, because i was on a nnew account and the only restore point was for an hour ago.   I really nedd help =[   (excuse my english btw i am Egyptian :D)

And in my case it's not just the last number that differs from my real IP adress, but the whole adress.    Does anyone have any idea how I can change this IP adress? Or know a way to work around it? Or is it something I've misunderstood?      Image related:  http://img3.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d...       Thanks ahead :D

But, I also read the same about the 478 socket p4 with a 479 P-M CPU swap that i decided to put in anyway and it worked just fine, so I'm looking more for a personal experience than what a forum or Intel says. So if anyone has decided to try and gotten results, I would appreciate to hear for you.   Thanks.

Hi Folks,      Is it safe to use an open proxy sever for personal information (such as banking) if the connection is under HTTPS?   (Using a proxy directly from a web browser…not CGI proxy)      1.) For example, if I connect to a online bank using a proxy server under HTTPS, can the operator of the proxy server have access to my login information, or is the info encrypted by the time it reaches the proxy?       2.) If I’m using a proxy server to connect to a site under HTTPS, is the entire connection under HTTPS…or only the portion between the proxy and the website…and therefore my connection to the proxy would be under plain HTTP and therefore unsafe…      Regards

20090307020443AASLqVR	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Making Image Map Using Gimp?	I'm trying to create an image map using GIMP. What I did was:      -import the image I wanted to use   -clicked filters > web > image map   - chose hot spots > designated the url for the hotspots   -saved the file      I was following this tutorial    http://nervy.pedf.cuni.cz/gimp-book/node...       and I guess it should work just fine. However, when I tried to save the file, it doesn't automatically save as an html file. Instead the default file type is .map      I made a long shot attempt to save it as an html file by altering the extension and putting in .html manually then clicked save.      When I opened the document I've saved, it directed me to an internet page where the 'imagemap' is located. However, instead of a clickable image that would direct me to various links, only a blank page that directs me to the links I specified appeared:   file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/...      I thought it could be because I manually altered the extension and replaced it with .html so I saved the same file as a .map file and opened it to see how it would look like. Unfortunately, it's still the same blank page with clickable links.       I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong so can anyone help me out? I just want to know how can I make the image show up.
20090227132040AAucdjA	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do you get around this problem?	How do you get around this problem?   I see many, many questions on Yahoo Ask where students and people of school age are asking to a Product Key for Microsoft Office as their 'trial' version has run out of time.   Schools and colleges alike are encouraging people to use Microsoft Office, but they must be aware that it is not free.Yet they offer no alternative.   This is leading pupils and parents (and not all can afford it) to a lot of stress and the temptation to "steal" by looking for the 'pirate' solution, which is very wrong.   What are the Education Authorities doing, if anything, about this? I can see this rapidly becoming a huge problem

20090307033855AAwQOpH	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Limited Connectivity Connecting to the Internet?	In our flat 3 of 5 laptops are Compaq, and just these three are experiencing frequent difficulties connecting to the internet. They connect to our wireless network with "limited connectivity" and can stay this way for many hours on end. The failing to connect is not consistent between laptops (ie: it may be working for one compaq but not the other). With as little jargon as possible, can someone please explain what is happening and how I can fix it? I cant find anything about it on google. The other laptops in our flat have no difficulties connecting whatsoever. Its not a matter of signal strength either, since with full bars the problem persists. Any help would be very much appreciated! Thank you!      -Tomo

This is for college and is going to replace my xbox 360 so I will be playing games (maybe crysis) on these laptops along with hd video and I will be doing audio creation in ableton live 7. The alienware M17 is good for gaming and just about everything else but the hp I feel is more for multimedia and has a bigger screen and the dell is more portable. All of these computers decked out and customized are around $4000 which is what i'm planning to spend max. Which one do you think would better suit my needs?

20090227131403AAyqF0s	Computers & Internet;Internet;Google	Is the bounce rate in Google Analytics something to rely on for blogs?	Well. I've been using Google Analytics for a while now, and figured out what bounce rate is. It's the amount of visitors leaving the website as they have viewed the front page.      My blog keeps a steady visitor base, and it gets higher and higher for every day that goes, almost all comments are giving credits to me for writing a great blog. The blog originally was something for family and friends, but now the people who comment are almost always strangers which I never heard of.      But I have one problem, my bounce rate is very high. It goes up and up for every day, yet I get more and more visitors every day. So my question is if the bounce rate really is something to rely on? I mean, as I have a blog, many people just view the front page, and then they go away. I don't know if the bounce rate is influenced by the average visiting time, and a lower visit time results in a higher bounce rate? In that case I obviously need to get better content.      But I'm not sure it is...      Sorry if I were like asking the question weirdly, I'm a bit tired.      Appreciating answers! :)

20090307040404AA40e84	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	I get funny picture when installing new RAM.?	I have Vista X32 bit and I currently had 2GB of RAM. My motherboard has two slots. Each slot had 1GB of RAM inserted. I removed them both and inserted my new RAM which is 4GB so I inserted the two 2GB sticks into each slot but when I turn on my computer, on the part where the windows logo appears, the picture was all funny. The shapes had sort of broken up and the colours had all changed. It looked like a series of coloured lines and blobs. Is it something to do with my GeForce 9800 GX2 graphics card. Im really stuck here.

I always watch DVD's on my laptop again this is daily, I have never had a problem with vision or sound or anything like that. untill today, I was on this morning when I went on to "movie mistakes" website, it came up but  then windows of movie mistakes kept popping up this happened for an hour I tried to cross them but it didn't  work it got to the point where 168 movie mistakes windows where opened, I shut down my computer and waited for a little while. I went back on around 10 minutes laters and the windows where gone. I then went to watch a episdoe of "friends" using my DVD player in my laptop when it had no sound, I guessed it was on mute or something like that so I went to the little toolbar at the bottom and clicked the Speaker thingy and it said "No audio output device installled" it has never said that before, I also did a virus check just to make sure it wasn''t anything like that and there was no threats at all.    I am confused why it did this- is it linked to the windows popping up this morning???   PLEASE HELP   10 points for best answer :D   Please tell me why its doing it and how I can get it working   Thanks   P.S~ I have had my laptop for around a year.

My professor is pretty old-fashion.  He requires us to print the code & display the output within the code.      Example:   --------------------------------------...   #include     using namespace std;      int main()   {   //comment lol   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;   return 0;   }      /*OUTPUT   ==================   Hello World!   Press any key to continue...   ==================   */   --------------------------------------...      ...which is ok, but here's my problem:      I am required to write a .DAT file using by using fstream, & he wants the output printed on paper, so my question is:  Is there a program/freeware out there that can convert the binary data in the .DAT file to ASCII text, or at least view it as ASCII---without actually opening a .DAT file with notepad?

My laptop says its connected, it can connect to Yahoo messenger and show that I have unread emails, my anti-virus can download updates but if I open up Internet Explorer, it won't load and says I'm not connected. I downloaded Firefox and that doesn't work either. My wifes laptop is connected to the same wireless network and she never has any problems like this.      One thing that does generally seem to get it working is deleting all my cookies and temporary internet files and then restarting. I'm kinda baffled as to why this started and what exactly is going on. Can anyone give me some help?

20090307055327AAYAqHl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My laptop has lost my files?	Ok yesterday I turned my laptop on, the desktop pic had changed, all my icons had moved and basically all my settings had been lost - it'd forgotten my msn log in, what internet browser i'd set as default etc. then i went on my pictures, all that was there was sample pictures. i ran a virus scan and noticed it was still scanning through the old files, which i can access if i use a run command. however every time i turn it on it takes ages to get from the welcome screen to my desktop and it seems to forget what i've told it to do for example saving log ins, or using firefox as my preferred browser. threes no virus on it as such, well my virus scanner doesn't say there is so i'm just wondering if anyone knows whats up with it? or is it just a case of old age laptop?

I had Hughes Net installed yesterday and now fear I made a mistake. I was unaware of the Fair Access Policy up until I violated it within 2 hours of installation. I guess I can deal with scheduling big downloads such as game patches during the free time, but I'm confused about what I can do for the other 21 hours of the day.      Am I using my daily quota when I watch videos on YouTube or video news clips?       I enjoy a little World of Warcraft and understand that it'll be slower and that I'll have to download patches during the middle of the night, but am I downloading anything when I'm just playing?      Is there anyone out there who is happy with their Hughes Net experience?

20090307073322AAWFfKL	Computers & Internet;Security	Packet Scheduler Miniport??? AVG Firewall question?	I'm concerned something bad might be on my computer.  It has been running extremely slow so I turned it off and unplugged it from the wall for a few minutes.  When it loaded up there is a AVG Firewall Profile Switch box that popped up.  It says:      A new or an unassigned network was detected on Intel(R) Pro/100 VE Network Connection - Packet Scheduler Miniport adapter.  Please enter the area name caption (then there is a box to enter the name I want to call the network)      THEN it says:      Please choose the desired Firewall profile.  The profile will be activated upon all future connections to this network.        My choices are Allow all, Block All, and Standalone computer... there are two check boxes       One says "disable area detection and automatice profile switch   One says "disable dialog for assigning new area      Two buttons... "Assign Profile" and "Without Profile".      Does anyone know anything about this and what it means?  I'm at a loss on what to do.  Thanks,

I am a college student and I'll use it almost exclusively for printing assignments, news articles, and research. As long as it can print text I can read, it's quality is acceptable. I would mostly like a printer who's cartridges are cheap both in cost and ink output. I would also like it to be wireless. Does anyone know where I can find reviews based on my specifications, most sites seem to focus on photo and graphic quality, which is unimportant to me.
