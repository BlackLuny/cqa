20090202153818AA82jtP	Health;Diet & Fitness	What do you think of fat parents with fat kids?	Doesn't it make you mad when you see fat parents with fat kids. Ok..so maybe the parents don't mind been fat but y wouldn't they make healthier choices for thier kids.   I was watching an old episode of wife swap today..and the father was feeding his 12 year old son and 14 year old daughter these huge philly cheese steaks..the parents were fat..the kids were fat...when the new mom asked y not make a healthier choice...he said "we are happy the way we are"...it was soo obvious that the teenage girl had no self esteem.      I know with some people it may be an illness or genetics..but for most people its not. I mean a Mom can't say its genetics when you know she is bringing her kids to mcdonalds 6 days a week for example.      what you think ??? why do parents not teach their kids healthy choices from day 1.      My Mom made sure i ate my vegetables and didn't keep much junk food in the house...we got a treat of fast food once a day...candy twice a week...i am sooo thankful that they did this for me....made the teenage years esp easier!

20090202161106AAOaEf8	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I loose some weight?	So my weight seems to be very stubborn, I can't loose any weight(or gain any). I'm not chubby or fat or anything but I wouldn't mind being a little trimmer. I have wide-ish hips and thick thighs and my arms could use a bit of work. I'm 5'2 and 137lbs so I have the potential to be much tinier than I actually am lol. So I played volleyball and we worked out every day for 2 hours and then practiced for 1 or 2 hours, I did this for about 4 months and still didn't loose any weight or get any visible muscle tone. We're starting to practive again after a 2 months break and I really wanna try to loose some weight this time. Granted my eating habits arn't great.....both my mother and I are very busy so usually our meals are quick and easy (were both horrible cooks). So I  usually don't really eat "meals" but more like healthy-ish snacks and lots of frozen foods. So can anyone maybe help me or give me some tips to loose weight?

20090202172519AAHygqm	Health;Women's Health	What are your thoughts on fibromyalgia?	Do you think its a disease or the symptoms of an underlying emotional/mental psychosis?      My friend of 25 yrs. started getting depression and was really stressed out with work and her bad romantic relationships. She was physical fit and exercised alot.      Over a two yr period she exhausted her health insurance with batteries of test that all were negative, got on medicare(fibromyalgia?), and was trying to talk her doctor into recommending a wheel chair.      She goes to a therapist for counseling but doesn't work the programs he sets up for her.....she only wants to focus on finding something physically wrong. Im really patient with her but she seems to thrive on the negative attention and pity? people express of "her problems".      When I try to talk to her about her counseling sessions she gets bothered and a bit angry but if I mention her other doctor appts she gets eager and is more than happy to talk about them.      I'm starting to think she has an emotional/mental problem that is just taking its toll on her body.      Her family does have a history of emotional/mental problems although she won't acknowledge it. One is anorexic and neurotic, another an alcoholic, another is morbidly obese.

Actually, from my waist and up I'm just fine. But what she gave me that I don't really like were her legs and let's just say that they're no Heidi Klum legs. I've recently lost 20 pounds and I have 20 more to go. I'm 5' 3" to 5' 4" and weight 142 lbs. My calves are very thick and I hate them so much. I also don't have very defined ankles. And my thighs are pretty big but that can be fixed with some cardio. I don't want my calves to get really muscular. I want them to be lean and thin. What are some exercises I can at any time of the day to fix this little genetic problem?      I've started doing calf raises wherever I am. I also read that I should strech before and after because that usually tones down muscle. I also read that pilates and yoga make the body leaner. What else is there? And can you confirm anything that I've read?   Thank you very much!

20090202175108AA41BtY	Health;Women's Health	What do you make of a pharmacist and assistant who are shocked by questions about birth control?	My wife asked a question about barrier methods of birth control and what products were available. Now I figure since these people write prescriptions for birth control and the condom stand with sex toys is standing right in the middle of the pharmacy section, that this would not make them uncomfortable.      My wife simply asked if a certain product was available or if it had been discontinued. The pharmacist was shocked that someone would ask about birth control and claimed she never heard of different methods of birth control. Now I just have to ask if somebody asks about Plan B, condoms, abortifacients, lesbian products, etc. it would be the same thing. Seems to me if you can't handle questions about sex and so forth, you shouldn't be a pharmacist.      I told this woman if I know more about it than she does, then it is highly questionable that she is allowed to prescribe drugs.

I'm also doing sit ups and running for weight lose and toning.      Any help on how to get smaller thighs would make me happy, thanks alot. :)

I do the same excersize every day still (30minutes walking and 4 times stretching for 35minutes.) all of my clothes still fit the same as before. I mean, I look the same and i'm still the same size in clothing and nothing is too tight ya know? what's going on?

(which reminds me when should i make the first move? is it alright to make it while were watchin a movie or out somewhere with friends or is it best to do it while we're alone at the movies or something? cause alot of ppl act like its ok to do it around friends but i always thought that might startle her and make her a little embarrased or something even if she did want it?) and the arrogant part is what i really need help with because the only thing im really arrogant about is running because i know that i can kick anyone's a** at it and academics too, but not as much, but still im very smart and so is she. so does he mean brag about myself more because if so im not going to listen to him cause thats just not me. so if anyone could give me some advice about all this ide really appreciate it. thanks :)

Is it hard to hide erections, or your penis in general if your long when soft?      Is sex a lot more work for you bc the woman can't handle it as well?

I have always wondered if it's a good thing or bad thing but I get really fast muscle pumps when working out. If I'm lifting weights my muscles get fully pumped by the second and sometimes even the first set. At times they get so pumped it's actually a big uncomfortable, I start feeling like my skin is gonna burst. If I'm rolling around doing some grappling my forearms get pumped within the first 5 minutes and it makes it real difficult to roll around for long because I lose flexability in my forearms, they start feeling too tight. And when I'm running my calves get really pumped as well and it makes it real hard for me to run for more than 30. If i keep training for a few weeks tho it's not as bad with the running. Someone told me it's because I have poor blood circulation. But I don't think that makes sense. And someone else told me I need more potasium. Anyway can I please get some help.

20070412115302AALlgrV	Health;Mental Health	Feeling lost & empty?	I feel like looking at my life from the outside I have a good life - I had good childhood, had fun in college, enjoyed my 20's, got married, have a beautiful daughter, financially doing ok - could be better but could be much worse. I'm able to work part-time and find it a nice balance between being a mom and working outside the home. I enjoy my job. So. . . why do I have this constant feeling like my life is missing something, its as though there is this void that needs to be filled. My marriage has been rocky over the years with ups and downs but I don't know if its just the norm or what and I've lately been feeling "out of love" with my husband and have contemplated divorce but I haven't gone any further than contemplating it. I don't know where to go - its not as though I feel sad or depressed - just lost.  What is this??

20090202204723AATJXjP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Test results negative, what could this be?	I know I wrote a book, but please read it if you can help!      I have had 4 or so UTIs and one kidney infection, and also ovarian cysts in the past. On Saturday I began to get low pelvic pain which quickly became accompanied with back pain, sharp or stabbing. The pain would come and go. I have been urinating frequently at night the past few weeks, but without pain. I was convinced I was coming up with another kidney infection (I had a full blown kidney infection for 2 whole weeks a few years abo and wasn't going to face that again, vomiting, fever, the works) so I went to the ER (urgent care was closed) saturday evening. They tested my urine for pregnancy and uti/kidney infection bacteria by way of urinalysis. I was also tested for PID, and a yeast infection. All results were negative. When he did the internal exam he pressed for sensitivity on the right ovary, cervix, and left ovary. The right and cervix felt fine, but when the left ovary was pressed on it hurt. The doctor was pretty much completely sure I had an ovarian cyst on my left side at this point, and asked if I wanted the ultrasound that night. I declined, and instead went in for the ultrasound today. I had my follow-up appointment a few hours later with a different doctor (gyno). The results of the ultrasound were also normal, despite the doctor's surety of a cyst. The doctor today seemed puzzled, as was I. I said maybe it was passed, but he said not to ignore any symptoms and to watch what happens and come in again if I need to. Today between 8am and 5pm I used the bathroom nine times, every single hour, and again at 7pm and 9:30 pm. I have not increased my water intake, and when I do go I am not urinating enough to indicate a full bladder. I am still experiencing some left side back pain (inside pain) every now and then, which I seem to feel more often when sitting down. If any one has experienced this or is a nurse, or has any ideas please, please reply!! I do not want to get sick (kidney infection) if it is a UTI! Thank you!!

I'm coming up on the end of my pack (my off week) and I'm trying to decide if I want to start a new pack and skip my off week or not. I'm trying to decide because my birthday is coming up (February 17th) and I definitely do not want to be on my period for my night away with my boyfriend. If I don't skip my off week, my period should come around within the next week or two, and who knows when it will be done. (My last period went for about a month, real heavy and then a light flow for weeks afterward.. it just barely ended about a week ago) Should I just skip my off week and know for sure I won't be on my period.. or should I take the risk and take my off week pills and hope my period isn't around on my birthday?

My pushup workout is mainly this-      Narrow Grip ( Diamonds ) 3x15   Decline pushups ( Elevated Feet Pushups ) 3x15   Regular Puhups 3x15      I never feel the "burn" in my chest when i do this or even after i finish it.      Is this normal theres always a slight soreness the next day though.         For my ab workouts like above i do them after lifting and it consists of       3x15 v-ups   3x15 reach and catch   3x1min. planks      After i do these my abs bulge out, At first i thought its just my abs tearing and the next day they would recover stronger/harder.       But then again i wondered if i was maybe not breathing properly?      If it helps im 14 5'7 and 130 lbs.       Thanks in return

I got more blood work done again about a month later and my kidney results are great (other than some crystals in my uric acid but hes not worried) but my ultrasound sound says there is some renal failure.    The doctor says it must be a mistake because it is not consistent with  my lab work which everything is pretty much perfect.

Skunks are able to defend themselves from an amazing multitude of predators including dogs, cats, ferrels, cayotes, people, and even mountain lions (it's true! -i'm watching it on the animal channel). It's unique spray is so potent because humans and other animals are very receptive to it's chemical makeup -some of the same chemicals that are given off in such scents as garlic, and onions- that it can make a person vomit immediately upon contact. Also, the scent doesn't leave as quickly as mace or pepper sprays.      My question is what do you think about using a Skunk's spray in place of mace or pepper spray as a defensive deterrant?  Do you think it would help fend off wild animals like bears and wolves, or even human attackers? Assume that the deterrant is controlled via an air-pressured canister so that it streams at its targets instead of misting/spraying everywhere. Does it seem practical, viable as a measure of protection?

My mom is bed-ridden because she is threatening miscarriage, My dad is in Florida on business, I am doing school almost full-time, and lately I've been having serious stomach cramps whenever I eat, so I quit eating for almost 5 days, and now I am eating only raw. And to top that off, My sister went into labor!!   I've been going to work, then school, then I come home to tend my little brothers so my mom can stay in bed. I haven't had time for homework and it's stressing me out! I like to get straight A's and not doing my work isn't going to help me with that.   I just feel so overwhelmed right now! I googled 'depression from stress' and I think maybe that's what I might have. The good news is, my daddy came home yesterday, and my sister had her baby 2 hours ago and everything worked out great. Also, my mom lost the baby tho, It's really sad. It's her 2nd miscarriage in a row, and she wants that baby really bad! I cry when I see her cry. I can't watch my family go through these things! I'm so happy for my sister and her new baby, and all seems a little better, but I still cry all of the time. I am so emotional and I can't stop! And I'm usually not like that! My tummy hurts now and again and at first i thought it was just my stomach cramps, my back aches when I play the piano, and I feel like I'm getting another migraine, and it is so hard to get some sleep, which I found were all symptoms of chronic stress. I suffer from trichotilomania, and I'm pulling my hair out faster than ever before! I'm soo scared! Is this normal?

I do have anxiety/depression problems, but none of that has stopped me before from having a healthy sexual appetite. I'm not currently on any meds. What is going on with my body?
20090202214157AAIWSrc	Health;Women's Health	Endometriosis in the brain and MS?	I have been having some nuerological problems and my doctor thinks it may be MS.  The only thing keeping her from diagnosing it is the fact that the MRI does not show scarring in the traditional MS areas.  We've done at least a dozen other tests to rule out everything else out there that mimics Multiple Sclerosis.  The MRI does however show scarring in other areas -- small "BB's" around the cortex areas of the brain.  I have a history of really bad endometriosis.  My first laparoscopy still holds the title of "worse case he's ever seen" even 10 years later.      Can endometrial lessions in the brian cause similar symptoms to MS?

20090203000821AA2kCsY	Health;Other - Health	Problem with a new specialty doctor?	I have an appointment on friday with a new doctor. He wants to do a biopsy sometime soon and wants to give me valium. The problem is that I can't take any bezo class medications due to some bad reactions I have had. They weren't allergies, they were adverse reactions but i could have died. Anyway he wants to overide the "don't dispense" at the pharmacy and give it to me anyway. I am not comfortable about it and told him that. My primary doc suggested a IV sedation for this procedure as a safer option. However since IV sedation usually isn't used for this type of biopsy the new doc finds that to be a "hassle". I feel so caught in the middle. Its not my fault. it just feels like he is using convenience over safety. Am I right? How should I tactfully broach this with him on friday?

20090202221807AAfqXY7	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Does anyone know about the prep for a colonoscopy?	I am getting an upper and lower scope tomorrow to try to find out what is causing my illness.  I was given instructions not to eat today, only drink clear liquids.  That at 2 pm to take 4 Dulcolax, then 2 hours later start drinking a mixture of Myralax with gatorade.  I was to mix 2 bottles (238 grams each) of the Myralax with 128 oz of gatorade and drink it all before midnight.  So that is 8 hours to drink that much.   The instructions said that when my bowels are clear that it will show by being a yellow color when I "vacate".        So here is my question....I have drank 64 oz already and have gone to the bathroom 15 times.  It is clear now.  Do I have to drink the other 64 oz?     I am hypoglycemic and the drink is making my blood sugar go up and that is making me feel even sicker than normal and giving me a nasty headache.  I am throwing up over and over.     Is it ok to call it good and not drink the rest so I can just go to bed?

I'm not really sure what to do, I can feel my eyes are dry, my eyes are normally dry.       I've been wearing glasses since I was six years old (I'm now almost 19) is it because my eyes are not used to direct contact with things like air currents?

And I would only manage to burn 250 calories in 45 mins. I noticed not a pound of weight loss in a year. I found myself only exercising to maintain my weight rather than losing it.      But now i have turned it down a little so its no longer as hard to do and I burned 500 calories in one hour. Will I still start to lose weight even if my workouts are not that intensive as they were before?      My diet according to my doc is fine because I only eat between 1200 to 1500 calories a day. But I am so fed up to see no results so he booked me in for a blood test which I have been holding off for several weeks. Is there any point of having it done?
20090202223305AAFefYx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Several Infections at once.?	I'm a 20 year old female who recently became very sick. I had a sore throat with white spots on the back..and even though I've had my tonsils removed I was worried it could be strep..so as I became worse after a few days I finally left work early & went to the emergency room.       There it was discovered that I had a UTI, a sinus infection that also caused an ear infection, an upper respiratory infection (like a cold in my lungs) and also, an ovarian cyst. I've had cysts before--actually had one rupture..but I was completely surprised at how many infections I have going on at once. They gave me tramadol for pain & a ten day course of augementin to fight the infections.      I haven't been to a doctor in about 2 years b/c I did not have insurance & already had racked up a $3,000 medical bill I am still paying on. To get to the point, should this be a cause for concern that I have multiple infections? I seem to always get sick! I used to get strep throat/tonsillitis once a month until they finally made me get them removed. I also have allergies. I try to be healthy. I drink tons of water and am not underweight or overweight. I exercise for at least 30 minutes 5x a week. I'll admit..I rarely eat fruits or take multivitamins b/c they give me a headache. I wouldnt consider myself an unhealthy eater, however!      What can I do to make my immune system better? Any suggestions would be great!!! Thank you :]]

However, it is becoming apparent to me that it is affecting things....I keep meaning to have him over for supper but I'm afraid if  don't tell him, my bizzare behavior will not come across right.  I would really like to tell him, he and I have a very strong honesty policy and I certainly do not want to hide it from him, but I want to tell him at the right time (I guess I feel it is too soon) and in the right way....I don't want him to think I'm looking for attention (this is a very embarrassing thing for me to be honest) and I don't want to scare him off.  I guess I'm just looking for some tips!  I really like this guy, of course I know if he's the guy for me he'll accept it and if he isn't  he won't...I just want to tell him in the best way possible.

I started having noticeable back problems only when I was about 15 and it's progressively gotten worse over the years, spreading to my neck, shoulders, chest, and worsening in my back.  It's now to the point that I am in a constant state of painful discomfort day and night.  In these areas I have severe muscle tension and cracking/popping sensations.  It all seems to be related.  I went to a chiropractor a few years ago, but it was costly and it seemed like I was being suckered.  I'm genuinely afraid that I will become incapable of doing everyday tasks like driving and working if it continues to get worse.  Does anyone know of anything affordable, safe, and possibly natural that would help me out?   I don't want to end up crippled at the age of 40 or in so much daily pain that I don't want to live.

Just for the record this isn't for any type of class! I've seen people do that a lot on here but I'm a mathematics Major! I just haven't seen a real answer on any websites I've looked at.

20090203011141AAFCtI3	Health;Mental Health	I have to go back to the therapist tomorrow?	Going to the therapist is nothing new for me. But I was given an assignment to evaluate my anxiety and also anger. I've finally admitted to myself that I can't control this. I always want to take care of things on my own but I can't for this. I feel like it's beating me.     Before it was kind of an "ignorance is bliss" type of feeling. I know I'm depressed and have anxiety problems, but I tried to look past them. Now that I've recognized my problems it's like they've gained up on me and beat the hell out of me. I'm not trying to sulk around about it: I want to get better and enjoy life. I feel like I've been wasting it.     For really the first time I'm afraid to see my therapist tomorrow. Ptobably because I know realize what I'm dealing with and not trying to deny it. It's really got me worked up as I'm on Yahoo Answers and it's after 3 am here. I start my day in four hours. I'm afraid to go to bed since I dread the coming day. I tend to try to make light of my feelings to my therapist even though he sees past it. I sometimes get defensive--this could be the case tomorrow. He told me I might need anti-depressants and to talk to him when I'm ready.     I just don't know how to handle my appointment tomorrow. I'm actually afraid to go. Any encouraging words or suggestions would be much appreciated as I'm pretty much a mess right now. And yes, I'm going to bed now. Thanks for your help.

20070428185550AAlcJSt	Health;Mental Health	Suicidal thoughts?	I have periodical thoughts of suicide. Usually something triggers them. Like when I get upset or angry about a situation. What stops me is not worring about causing others pain. Because The people responsible for the way I feel deserve all of the pain in the world! But then again you can't cause people pain if they don't feel anything or have no conscience. Anymore when people see news about a suicide they just ignore it and drink their coffee, or whatever. What stops me is I do have a conscience! And I also think that there still may be hope for me in this place full of evil self righteous robots with no conscience. So, then again mabe I should live and make their lives as miserable as possible? Or mabe I should just live life for me and obey the laws and forget that these worthless individuals exist? Well, that isn't so easy, but I just can't seem to give up on life.

Well, my body is weird, if someone looked at my upper body, (waist up to head) he would think I m quite slim.. But the problem is, my lower body is kinda "fat".. It's not really fat I guess, since the shapes of muscles are distinguished; It looks like muscles that have been stretched and relaxed or something. Just my body "design" I suppose..

Wouldn't really like to exercise the hell out of my legs and make them look thin and all muscly either.. That would suck for me. Hope there's a solution.. Many thanks!

Now for people who have done the 20 minute workout before, is it Ok to follow Dagne on the first couple of times that you do this video. Dagne is the one who is a bit dissabled and does an alternative to the regulare pillates exersises because supposubly she has problems in like the back and neck and stuff.So is it ok for the first times I do this video to follow her. Because these exersises are kind of hard for me! Just until I can get used to them.

20090202205415AAYVRhG	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Carcinogen levels high in recent blood work...?	My mother is a cancer survivor of 4 times now. She was diagnosed in 1999 with breast cancer...went through chemo/surgery/radiation and went into remission. About 5-6 yrs later it was found that it metastasized to her lungs so she underwent chemo, not able to do radiation since it was so close to her breast that had already been treated. Two yrs ago it metastasized to her bones, primarily in her right hip so chemo and radiation again. This past summer found new cancer in her other breast...more surgery and chemo. She recently got some blood work done and found high levels of carcinogen in her blood. Normal level is 3 and her level was 8. She keeps telling us its "normal" and "nothing to worry about" but that's a little tough. She went in for a bone scan last week and we're waiting for the results. Question...sorry it took so long...is there a chance that the high level means nothing and the cancer has stopped spreading? I am not in denial and know there is a good chance it may have spread again....I'm wondering the odds of the test coming back negative for new cancer. Any advice would be appreciated.

So here's my story. i've been on birth control for about a year & a half. but its made me gain about 40 lbs so i decided to get off it. me & my boyfriend always use condoms anyway. i got my period around jan 7th (id get it the first Wednesday of every month while on the pill) i guess about 5 days after this we had sex. (no more period) the condom broke. we went straight to planned parenthood so i could get plan b. i took it within the same hour & even stayed up til 3 am just to take the 2nd one. i thought everything was fine until about 3 days ago when i went to the bathroom & when i wiped there was pink on the toilet paper. then the day after there was light blood on my underwear. it went away the day after that but now its back to light on the toilet paper when i wipe. i researched & it said light spotting before period is due to implantation?       i shouldn't have my period til Wednesday. if i don't have it then im going to go to the dr to get a pregnancy test.       is this because i am pregnant? or is it because i'm not on birth control anymore? i'm so confused. please help!

I am on the next to the lowest dose and I do not feel they do any good.  I am able to control my anxiety without the medicine.  Plus, I feel it is unhealthy for me to have these chemicals in my body.  I want to get off of my medicine, but everytime I taper down, I get incredibly sick.  I have even gotten so sick from the withdrawal symptoms that I thought I was going to die!  Seriously.      How in the world does anybody ever get off of anti-depressants without debilitating side effects?

20090202210643AA0jAMI	Health;Mental Health	What to expect from a psychiatrist visit?	I was anorexic for a few years between grade 7 and grade 10.     Out of nowhere I started binging and gained weight.     I was 82 pounds when I started eating more.     Now my weight fluctuates between 117 to 123 pounds at 5'5.     It still seems like I have an "anorexic mind" and always try to eat less.  I end up binging.     It seems like I've gone from anorexia to binge eating but my weight is controlled with diet pill abuse and fasts.     I think I may be experiencing depression, anxiety, severely low self-esteem and confidence.  I've had a few suicidal thoughts.  It feels like I've been more depressed than usual.      I just asked my mom tonight if we could get a psychiatrist.  She said I'll have one within a week or two.   What could I expect from a visit from a psychiatrist?     Would I be prescribed any medication after a while?  If so, what?   Am I at a healthy weight for my height right now (5'5, 117-123 pounds)?  I've been wanting to start exercising to be healthy and possibly control binging and stress.  Unfortunately, my non-existent self-esteem is preventing me from going to the gym..

I have a total phobia of needles and my husband calms me down through the whole process.  The front office was rude to me about it today (I'm 13 wks preg) - to the point of tears.  When I mentioned it to my doctor she said it was because they are so busy, blah blah HIPPA blah... not enough room.  (He isn't violating anyone's HIPAA rights if he isn't talking to anyone but me and my nurse!)  Don't my husband and I have a right to be together at all points through this process?  Is this worth trying to find another doctor?  I am afraid it's an early warning sign that they care less about me and more about how many patients they can shuffle through in a day.  Worries me for the future delivery.  I have very strong opinions about wanting to have a birth plan, etc and to be in control of what is happening to me as much as I can.  (And no, I don't plan on second guessing the MD if it's a life threatening situation, but I don't want to be pushed into accepting more intervention during birth, when I want less if that makes sense.)  Maybe I am just scared bc it's my first, but can any mothers share their opinion on this?

I am so discouraged, sad, frustrated and not to mention worried sick. The medical community has let us down and no one in it really seems to care. I even took him to a psychologist so no one could say maybe he is depressed. The psychologist agreed my son has no mental problems or depressed he doesn't feel well.

I just never get tired or hungry, even if i don't eat.      I've become apathetic towards things i usually have interest in, people i usually care about and things going on in my life that i would usually worry over. I just don't care anymore.      I constantly feel like im not apart of reality, sort of numb. When i do something, anything at all, it feels surreal, kind of like im not really doing, more watching somebody else do it, just in first person view. Basically, i feel disconnected.      My school work and relationships are beginning to suffer because of it.      It's starting to really bother me, i don't leave the house in time to catch the bus because i can't find any point in it, i have to buy new clothes because my old ones don't fit anymore because im never hungry so i don't eat.      I'm really getting sick of walking around like a zombie all day, and when ever i talk about it with my mentor in school, she thinks im exaggerating and she thinks im just under stress (from what, i can only guess), my friends think im being cold, and my family think i'm going through one of those "teenage phases".

Since August of 08 i started to change my nutritional habits and one of the new "rules" i usually follow is the 20% sugar rule (I avoid eating anything where sugar is greater than 20% of the total carbohydrates). So every now and then when i do eat something sweet,(cake, chocolate, even fruit) i do feel a bit... tingly all over my body, like when adrenaline hits you... in a way. So i have to do some sort of activity to work it off, like walking, dancing, jumping rope etc. Well sometimes i cant do that (bc im at work or wahtever).

Just over a year ago, while moving house, I dropped a pile of heavy-ish books and the bottom of the books hit the front of my leg above my ankle on the way down. It must have really hurt because I remember yelling in a really unladylike manner. I'm trying to describe this in slow motion but it's tricky; the books sort of slid down my leg once they met it, grazing and bruising it before hitting the ground, leaving a bruise that was a perfect horizontal line at the top sort of smudged downwards. The point is, it was an usual way to get a bruise. After a few minutes it was fine then the next night it was swollen, multicolored and extremely sore. Since that night, it's been painless and quickly faded to green but it's still as visible and green as a almost year ago!!   This is the only case I've had of a bruise sticking around, but I'm still quite concerned since that area of my leg has recently started hurting sometimes at night, odd yes. I've heard some scary ideas like Hemophilia, Diabetes and Liver problems but they seem a bit much, for the most part I'm fine. Does anyone know what's going on? If you know anything pleeaase help. I get anxious easily so please be gentle

20090202211848AAWcphi	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this a legit workout plan?	ok so i am 15, so still growing. i tend to work out every 2-3 days or so, and i have a protein shake after i work out. but here i s my question, i have heard that it is best to reach you limit within 1 hour. does this apply for me in general, or just 1 muscle group. because i tend to work my shoulders and biceps after school, and i tend to work my lats, traps and triceps before i go to bed. should i work out all at once, or is this fine? i only have 1 protein shake a day, and i eat a TON afterwards. i also get my time to rest so it seems to be a good plan, but i have not seen any results yet. so i would like to correct it before i get to far into routine.

20090202212729AA2Es5Y	Health;Mental Health	Im always thinking about bad memories of my childhood, teenagehood, why? Long Story please read..?	Every single day, as I work, drive, study, walk, listen, or just clear my mind. Those negative images, and past events are always haunting me. I never forget the day my mom and dad separated, I clearly remember seeing the police come, my dad yell and verbally abuse my mother, his violence and rage throughout the house. I remember it like if it were yesterday that he were slamming doors, punching walls, throwing chairs and whatever else was near him, breaking glass, cups, and plates, all the while I was mortified that he was going to hurt me. Possibly do some kind of beating on my mom. I remember being little and my dad always rejecting me, I was always told to be quiet. This taught me to have my mouth shut even to this day.This is why people tell me im so quiet. I remember eating at Taco Bell when I was little, It was my mom, dad, older brother, and me, I was so happy for some reason, and when we were all at the table, I was talking, my dad told me when people eat at the table you have to be quiet, no talking. I remember feeling crushed and hurt, because I didnt know what i did that was so wrong?      I remember being at my private school, my dad was a school teacher, he gave preferrential treatment to my other classmates over me. For one christmas concert, instead of usually filming me, he had the the camera on me for a few seconds then left the rest of it, and zoomed in onto another girl named Desree, ( he cheated on my mom, with Desrees mom) I remember the horrible feeling i had watching how he had gave her favor over me. Always had recorded me, but this concert he took the focus away from me and video taped her :( I felt like I was no good, i felt ugly and fat, accompanied by a million other feelings.       I always remember my dad telling that i was overweight, suck in my stomach, and he would even laugh at my posture, jokingly he would tell me to fix it and sit straight. I remember him always yelling, being violent, being the one whom always controlled everyone. I remember us going to bookstore, and my dad would always distract everyone with a book or magazine that they liked, and he would go look at "artistic nude photos" if i even came close to him he would raise his voice at me, as though I were an inconvenience. I remember unintentionally one time I popped out of nowhere to ask him "dad have you seen the Barbie Book?" he turned at me with a sour angry face and loudly said "NO I HAVE NOT SEEN THE BARBIE BOOK" at the same time trying to be discreet and close the book he had in his hand, but I knew what it was, i thought he was sick for doing it. Im always thinking of negative things that occured to me I dont know why?      I remember always crying myself to sleep, and shake while I heard them yell. I remember him always telling me that he was going to divorce my mom. I stilllive here with them, and I hate everyday of it.
