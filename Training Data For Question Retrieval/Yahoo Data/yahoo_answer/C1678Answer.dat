GH3X1aobaa	With a few words the majority of Cypriots are Greek and very proud of it. Now to get back to the original question there is a small percentage of greek cypriots that like to be called only Cypriots, But then again this are the same people that still beleve that the ideal political ideology is communism.    Now on the argument if cyprus is greek or not Read on:  According to the last census carried out by the Republic in 1960, Greek Cypriots comprise 77% of the island's population, Turkish Cypriots 18%, while the remaining 5% are of other ethnicities. However, after the Turkish invasion of 1974, the demography of the island changed considerably due to the economic prosperity in the areas of Cyprus still under the control of the Republic of Cyprus in contrast to the international isolation and economic downturn experienced the areas under the control of Turkish troops. In the latest census in 2006, the percentage of Greek Cypriots remained steadily at 76% (660,000) while the population of Turkish Cypriots dropped to 10% (89,000) as many emigrated to western countries. (reff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus)|`|8ivnzNi5aa	It may be because there are also Turkish Cypriots.  Just a guess.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	For the same reason a Canadian wouldn't like to be called American. Cypriots are not Greeks.|`|UBNEzh0Saa	Because they are not Greeks.|`|gV6kZeAraa	And who in the sane mind would?    @Yep, that is why I put the whiskers on.  To make it different from your moustache.|`|7lMaoTQvaa	Its cause they are Greek.  Whoever yep is...she says that to everybody.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	I have never heard from any Cypriot that they don't like calling them Greeks.  Unless if they are one of the Turkish settlers in the illegal occupied part.    Even they Turkish speaking Cypriots , say they are CYPRIOTS,if you call them Turkish are against that.And for the Turkish users that are going to answer, I am talking about the TCypriots, not about the settlers. .....|`|NTGuR64Raa	Because they are proud of their independence from Greece but still maintain sovereignty.

I am Cypriot and Greek is my nationality. Like it? I am a Greek above everything else.     The only Cypriots I can think of, not like being called Greeks are the Turkish Cypriots and the Maronites but then again, they are not Greeks anyway. There are some others, communists mostly who may also don't like being called Greeks, but then again they don't believe in the idea of the nation anyway.    There are some good answers in that forum if you really care.    Edit: I can't believe some people here. Probably they know better what I feel about me or how the Greeks of Cyprus have been considering their selves for the last 3500 years and more: always Greeks (never "romioi" by the way).|`|g2MKwVCWaa	The like to be called "Greek Cypriots" not just Greeks.

RhkKGsipaa	if you mean for prostitutes,  they are fairly overt in the tourist towns lke Sosa and many small hotels are inexpensive.|`|36a3ynpJaa	If you are wondering if the DR is the Thailand of the Caribbean, then yes.  It also has a high HIV rate like Thailand.     But it's cheap for regular tourism as well.  I lived there for nine months and it is a great place in many ways and only about a five hour flight from Newark.   Some guys would come down for the weekend from NYC.  I recommend the North Coast since the other tourist areas are over  They are coming along fast and there are ATMs and internet cafes everywhere.  You do have to be a bit careful and use common sense esp in the discos with pick pockets but that applies to any tourist area in the world pretty much.    Google Sosua to find out more.   Most hotels are under $50/night and a budget of $100/day will cover hotel, food and beer easily.    The summer is dead for tourism and the high season is from about November until May.|`|60FewKX6aa	I'm going to assume you mean to vacation? Yes it can be..depending on what your interests are and where you will stay etc.. can't really give you any more information unless you specify what you're asking :) If you mean to live..then I'll have a completely different response.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	If you mean going there to LIVE there.. then you DO KNOW that you have to POST A CASH BOND OF $17,000 in any D.R. bank in order to get resident alien status....you DO KNOW THAT... right?|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Very very good. I am not a single man I am a single female BUT the place is fantastic.    The Dominican Republic is the cheapest place to go in the Caribbean and once there everything is cheap (some haggling will have to be done though).    Different places in DR (like everywhere in the world) are better for different things.    Puerto Plata is huge with plenty of shops, bars, excursions and some of the best beaches/resorts in the DR. Its a great place.    Boca chica is very quiet, ok for bars and nightlife but nothing great and seems to be ALOT of prostitution going on here.    Sosua is very nice, small but nice. Some good night life but nowhere near as wild as Puerto Plata. It is great though however for water sports and stuff.    message me if u want to know the best places for you specifically (i'll need to know what ur looking for etc though). I have been to the DR LOTS of times.|`|IstwJtBraa	The answer to your question is 100% YES.  It is a great place and I have lived here for 10 years.  You also don't need to put 17,000 dollars  in a bank account to get resident status.  That just isn't true.  Most of the people I have met here couldn't come up with that much money if their life depended upon it.    Go to Sosua, look at Casa Cayena, Hotel Europa or if there are two of you check out EL Neptuno Condos.  El Neptuno has the best location and it is a great place to stay.  High season is only 600 a week for a 2bed/2bath Lux condo which is only 300 bux a person if there are two of you.    Have fun!

I often book VERY safe 4 star hotels in Midtown Manhattan, right in the center of the city for $80 per night.

I could go on and on and on and on about things you could do in the big city, but I won't, due to a limit of how much I can write. I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts. Here is the official website >>> http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/    Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

T2PRG16taa	Package deals are not necessarily the cheapest way to go.    There are cheap cruises to the Bahamas from Miami.  Then maybe you could camp out.    Try couchsurfing.com, take a look at frommers.com for packages.    Mexico is cheap, but you have to get there.  You might be able to get a flight for $200 rt from Newark or Baltimore to Cancun.

Hope this helps|`|DfIaAkwfaa	Barbados is an amazing place!|`|CJeufMTWaa	Most package deals have gone up in price ever since gas went up.  It will be hard to find something under $500 for a package deal.  Your best bet would probably be a three or four day cruise to the bahamas, usually around $350 regularly priced, but you can probably get something lower during a sale.

Worse case scenario would be maybe getting dengue which would be very very rare... Also like someone said above me, use a condom because just like ANY other place in the world, there are STDs here in latin america.  Other than that, don't worry enjoy the trip.

It was a cool show. There were biblical landmarks he talked about and no it wasn't anything to do with the Strait of Tiran.    The reason G-d sent Moses by that indirect route is because the Land of Israel was already inhabited by some very violent people.  A direct route would have made them think that "oh maybe it wasn't so bad in Egypt" and they might have turned back, being us weak humans and all.  He had some work and lessons for us to do along the way and therefore the indirect route and for us to be out in the wilderness for awhile. He taught us some good stuff while we were there! :)|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	Could it be? Very well it could.    That is probably why Egypt felt they had the right to blockade it in 1967 and cut the whole area off from the sea.  That started a whole war and carved out the Israel we know of today.

Bills are identical in colour (depending on the denomination), coins have the same value (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, 1e, 2e) but various euro-using countries have different images on theirs, though they will all say "EURO 1cent", "EURO 2cent", et cetera.   As far as knowing its value compared to the us$ or any other currency - it can fluctuate.  I usually use www.xe.com    Foreign exchange office is a "bureau de change" in french. (just in case you didn't know)|`|tQsxsuNPaa	No.  Not unless they have an accurate crystal ball.    And the Euro is the same everywhere.  There is no such thing as a "French Euro".  That's kind of the point of the Euro.     Right now, it's 1.28 for a Euro.  (US) which means you'll probably pay about $1.33 or so per Euro (it's never as good in real life as the signs and exchangers tell you...plus you'll always pay a small fee for the exchange.)    You can do the math yourself.  You multiply whatever the exchange rate by the number of Euros to get how much something costs in Dollars, or you multiply .78 by the number of dollars to get the number of Euros...5 x .78 = 3.90|`|tgMIvZepaa	Do a search on your web browser and search for "exchange rates"|`|hel4ebsoaa	The Euro is teh commonn term for the monetary unit in those member countries in Europe who share the same conage/money,France happens to be one of those participating members and so is Germany etc etc...there areno French Euros nor are there any German Euros....It is the same monetary unit all over...No way of predicting the value of a Euro in Februaray...GO on any financial website and they give you easy methods of figuring the exchange rate...You put in the amount of money in the currency you have and click on to the currency you want to convert it too...Very simple and very accurate.

aiKLvwGTaa	In some people's lives, yes, but it is not our driving force in the same way it is in other countries.    Northern Ireland is a major issue RE religion. I don't know how much you know about the NI and Eire conflict, but a large part of it is based on the fact that NI is Protestant, and Eire is Catholic. I remember a few years back, where the Catholics were throwing stones at 4 year old Protestants on their first day of school. That was pretty harrowing.    According to the last census (2001), 72% of the UK counted themselves as Christian. The next largest group was non-religious people, with 15.5%. Contrary to popular belief, only 2.7% of the country is Muslim.    Personally, I don't know many people who practise their faith. The ones I do seem to pick and choice as and when it suits them.    I just skim read this, but it might be worth a read:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in...    All the stats are towards the bottom.|`|9J4PbcIGaa	The UK! One of my favorite subjects. First of all if you're writing a report I will advise you not to use Yahoo Answers as a credible source! It is however a great way to get pointed in the right direction. Religion at one point played a huge role in that area (before it became the UK). Think about it, all the kings of England insisted that they were on the throne by divine right. In other words God had put them on the throne. It's very fascinating really. Now that the UK is part of the European Union I don't think that religion plays as big of a role.Separation of church and state is big in those areas. They believe that religion should be a choice that the government should stay out of. That is the short version of the answer. You have to ask yourself several questions before you can begin to answer this one though. First of all are you writing about religion and it's role in the government? Or are you writing about religion and it's role within society as a whole. You may find two totally different answers if you look at it that way.  I'll include a couple of websites in the source section for you to refer to. These websites can be used as credible sources in a paper.|`|kiNBVPdMaa	Previous well intentioned answer is correct in one thing, be very careful believing what you read on here. However the rest is rather misleading    In the UK religion has a very prominent role constitutionally, although the divine right of Kings went out with Charles I several 100 years ago the sovereign is still 'defender of the faith' in this case the faith being the Church of England (Christian protestant). Prince Charles (who will be the next King George...confused yet ?) has stated several times that he will be 'defender of faith' (all faiths, not just one).    The church of England also plays a constitutionally important role.      This situation is mirrored in several other European countries (especially those with monarchies...Belgium, Holland etc) where there is a direct link between the church and the crown.    That said... all this is 99.99% of the time irrelevant, the UK has had Prime Minsters (the real power) from differing religions for 100's of years... jewish, catholic and there is no restriction on anybody based upon religion.     How big a part religion plays in daily life in the UK varies massively depending on the religion and also how individuals adhere to it's teachings. You would get very different answers from (for example) muslims, jews, protestants and catholics.|`|49f80f254c9a13d56cc1097e04b35aa7aa	Religion has little or no relevance in UK, however, if islam continues to flourish, the christian (?) majority may return to the old ways in defence.

AA11496012	I am a frequent flier account for both United and Delta.  United has made changes to their policy and the miles expire now 18 months instead of 36.  If you keep your account active, then your miles to not expire.  Delta's policy is 24 months now.  You can enroll in the United Airline's credit card program and receive around 20,000 miles.  The first year there is no annual fee.  But then the annual fee is around $60.  Delta has the American Express SkyMiles card.  I think they give you around 10,000 or 25,000 miles and the annual fee is $85.|`|eulMjLtPaa	I use United, but just because they have the most flights to where I like to travel.  Their program is pretty good, miles don't expire if you use the program at least once a year, and if you get a United Visa card you immediately get 20,000 miles plus 1 mile for each dollar spent.      I don't know of any frequent flyer programs that charge a fee to be a member.

AA10863966	I guess it depends on where you are going. (which you don't say)  People often don't realize how big Alaska is. That little image in the corner of most maps is not to scale. here is a picture that gives you a realistic idea of the area we are dealing with.  http://www.tongass-seis.net/media/tong_U...  Remember the volcano is near anchorage,so depending on where you were going to visit the volcano could be as far away as half the country.  Also Alaskans are not really worried about this situation (at least in the Interior where I live, and speaking to friends down south) We handle all kinds of strange and or extreme occurrences in stride.     Not sure what outdoor activities you had planned for this time of year, but extreme cold or freakish warm temps are more likely to disrupt those then the volcano.    So watch the updates on Mount Redoubt, but I would advise you not to overreact. And if it blows while your here imagine how cool it will be to be that close to an eruption :)  http://www.avo.alaska.edu/activity/Redou...|`|vKYdV5r2aa	Sounds like a HOT time to me !!!!!!!!!|`|JK2RvliYaa	I think that you wont die but it may be a cool experience, are you going on a cruise?|`|kLFsztSLaa	http://europesworld.info/|`|OUcQjqI0aa	don't worry about the volcano, as long as you're not trying to climb it while it's erupting you'll be fine.

feapxnJPaa	I've heard that Disney cast members point with two fingers rather than one because that's how Walt pointed because he was always holding a cigarette.  The statue called Partners in front of the castle in the Magic Kingdom (of Walt holding Mickey's hand and pointing off into the distance), Walt is actually pointing towards the nearest smoking area.    This isn't actually true, but it's a funny myth.    Here's a cool fact:  An experiment was run to see how long people would carry garbage before they just threw it on the ground.  The average was 30 feet.  In Disney parks, you'll find a garbage can every 30 feet.  Walt didn't like people seeing garbage, so he hired people to design something that would make garbage seem like it disappeared.  You know those garbage cans with the flaps over them so you can't see the garbage?  Those were an invention of Disney Imagineers.  Every cast member picks up garbage, not just the custodial crew.  If you DO throw garbage on the ground, it will be picked up within 5 minutes at most.    Things cast members will tell you:  There is a wire that runs from the top of Cinderella's castle.  It is really a wire that a man dressed like TinkerBell goes across during the nightly fireworks show.  During the day, though, if you were to ask a cast member what that wire was, they will tell you one of these:    That's where Cinderella hangs her laundry.. she still likes doing her own chores.  That's the cable wire so Prince Charming can get ESPN  We decided to give the birds someplace nice to watch the 3:00 parade.|`|rSq790ksaa	In Disneyland there is a basketball court at the top of the Matterhorn ride.    In Epcot there is a latch so you could stand on the top of the Epcot ball if you wanted to (but they probally won't let you).    In Muppets 3D in Hollywood Studios when you walk through the door there is a sign on the right side with a ticket booth that says "key under mat" if you pick up the mat there is actually a real key under there.    Main St. was built to look like Walt Disney's hometown.    Pirates of the Carribean was the last ride in Disney World that Walt supervised before he died.    There are hidden Mickey images all over the parks.    Look at the well near the Indiana Jones Stunt Show as you'll get a suprise.    There are talking trash cans that they let roll around in Tomorrowland in Magic Kingdom and at the Electric Umbrella counter service restaurant in Epcot.     If you go by the dance studio building on Main St. you can actually hear the sound of people tap dancing and it sounds like there is a real class going on.    In Tom Sawyers Island in Magic Kingdom if you go there first thing in the morning look for Paintbrushes (not keys like someone else said) They hide about 3 of them if you get find one take it to a cast members and they will give you a free fastpass for all day in the parks.|`|UxpRkWnkaa	Disneyland consists of one park plus CA Adventures and covers just about 160 acres.

Locals can easily live on that, but I'd expect you'll want to go on tours, visit places of interest, go shopping and eat out. Entrance to the Jin Mao Tower when we were there was 50RMB plus a ferry from The Bund for 5 yuan, so that and a meal would blow your budget for the day.

Oh yes, just a quick note, do NOT go anywhere with anyone, (male or female) asking to 'practice their English' etc. If you do get approached and think they are genuine, go to somewhere like a major chain (Starbucks/McD etc) if they would prefer to go to a place they know, (such as a bar or club, even a hotel) refuse, or you'll be left with a lot less of your 2300RMB when you leave!|`|1LlhqADoaa	not enough to live there for a month|`|g0YNQdL2aa	I used to spend that in one week-end, mind you, it was in the western restaurants and bars that took up most of that.      also listen to Limahl, he is correct in what he has to say.|`|oeAUkiq5aa	Nope, 2300rmb can only maintain basic needs of daily life for a month, that does not include apartment rental, clothing, entertainment.|`|Pg6A6CXCaa	MAYBE|`|e4a1f4299fe0d89ebbbee63a1c430347aa	not really|`|McGkrDH2aa	Yes, it depends on which life you would live.

Everyone there thinks the other guy is immensely rich, so he better try to get rich too by trying to overcharge the next person possible.    Remember that the only thing of any importance in China is money. Never ever assume anything is normal.  Do not forget the check everything, ask everything, and count everything twice.  The Chinese are experts in confusion and hyperactive business practices.  Customer service is non-existent in China anywhere and the only thing they can truely promise a foreigner is that he will get ripped off any-and-every-way-possible  So, for whatever reason you may choose to visit China, do not so much as buy a soda, without first exacting the preicise price, then check the bottle for worms, and the date, you can bet the date will be old.  If you buy a pair of pants here for less than 200 RMB you can bet the legs will fall off 5 minutes after you leave the store where you paid for them.  The Chinese will deny anything was wrong with them before you took them though.  Have you ever heard of Gypsys?  Once you give a Chinese any money, you will never see it again.  There is NOT a refund policy of any sort in China.  You will never ever receive a refund for the smallest thing.  Once you pay, you lose.  So, I wish you luck in Shanghai on 2300RMB for a month, wo da tienna|`|f46iJJ6raa	2,300 RMB is the price of one cocktail at a Shanghai nightclub.

qdsVS1dDaa	You asked:  can anyone really be stuck in an airport for days and how??? and also how can weather cause someone to be stuck that long and which weather elements will do that.    Stuck for days,  yes, due to snow or fog or smoke.  All of these can present conditions that do not permit flight operations. These conditions can persist for days.     When conditions are bad at a connection point, such as O'Hare, most ticket agents at an upline station, where you are originating your travel, will change your ticket to a different day without charge if asked to. I wish I had a buck for every one that I have written like this in my career.     Regards,  Dan|`|N7G26k4Iaa	I am not really sure what you would want the airlines to do in this situation.  There were so many canceled flights that there was no capacity on any flights for a couple of days.  And if you are stuck in the airport and it is not the airline's fault, they are not going to put you up in a hotel.  You can always buy travel insurance to cover you for this kind of thing.  This happens a lot more than you would expect, especially over the holidays when the flights are full.    BTW, I always allow for a long layover through O'Hare in the winter.

Russia is only suffering the same as everywhere else due to the economic recession.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	i hardly hear any problems coming from russia today.  they are causing more problems than they are recieving.  communism wouldve just isolated them today like cuba from US.|`|t7pDjDo1aa	When I read the Russian press I have the same impression of the rest of the world. What a coincidence! :))) Majority of the Russian population think of the Soviet Union in a positive way, but only minority would like to have it again. The Soviet Union was a welfare state where the state heavily subsidised health system, education (from nursery up to the University level) etc. The price for that were civil rights limitations and other nicities. In a situation of the present Russian "wild West" type of capitalism it seems that the Soviet Union was a paradise. Actually it wasn't. So, to put in a nutshell, Russia is still looking for its new identity but it will survive. :)|`|PnmvsKqBaa	Russia use to be better during Soviet Union, but then again...the world was in big trouble. My grandma is retired Communist, When my mom was young she was in a communist group. During summer kids would go to this summer camps, kinda like boy scouts. Except its for boys & girls. They would teach you how to be a proud Russian citizen & stuff.    People were well groomed back then, kids studied hard in school & very little crime.      And now...it has all failed, including  the economical status.|`|0Yj0my65aa	USSR is the best!|`|ed2Zmw2aaa	kinda, sense, the fall, of course the population dropped..but know the crime is higher, in some sense, and their is still a Decling population in Russia, Russia's population declines every year...Their are way more abortions than Births, and males only live on aveage to be 65 or so, and alcohol is a major reason, and smoking, the party to much i guess.. THey need less abortions, thus a decling population is bad for school systems and for the economy|`|LDEynZrcaa	No, but some people will say yes to USSR any time.

jLTDqVHsaa	Public transit is quite good here.  It's the best way to get around in most cases.    There is a day pass, and it's not only for visitors.  It's the one-day "FunPass," for $7.50.  It's good on the subways and local buses, and is vaild from the moment you use it until 3 AM on the next day.  Buy it at a MetroCard vending machine in Penn Station (not NJ Transit or LIRR machines), just follow the signs to the A/C/E or 1/2/3 trains and there will be machines around.    If you have any questions, feel free to ask!|`|41ERg1Gvaa	A one-day "Fun Pass" for $7.50 will provide you unlimited rides on the MTA subway system and local buses (not express buses, but that's not what you would likely need as a tourist anyway).  http://www.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.h...|`|R3ghjVscaa	It does not called Vistor Pass.  You could get $7.50 1-Day Pass called Fun Day Pass which is activated at moments you buy your MetroCard and expires 3am following day.    You could use on any subways, Staten Island Railway's St. George Station, MTA Regional Bus (NYCT, MTA Bus, Long Island Bus), Roosevelt Island Tramway operated by RIOC and Westchester County Bee-Line Bus System, but not $5 express buses.

23vKOyBraa	Google Maps (Japan) and street views (real life camera images) have always worked fine for me. I often "stroll" around streets from my computer at home. Walking down memory lane, seeing restaurant signs and remembering I had a date there etc.    There is no reason it shouldn't work. Unless, like bluemoon says, you are spelling the city incorrectly (adding -shi) when it may not be required. Sure, you are technically correct, but does your computer and the computer programmers know that??    Try the local city council offices, they may well have info and maps in English of their area for the benefit of non-Japanese speaking residents.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Place "Toyota, Aichi, Japan"  (not Toyotashi)    and hit again. You'll get the map of the city. then, search with any wording later.      All infors are not in English because Japan is not   English but Japanese country.

vl6OtBfWaa	Your mother was way over allowable limits for alchol and any foodstuffs like peppers is illegal because of agricultural contamination.  Your mothers stuff was confiscated because she broke the law not cuz thay like doin it.    And on a side note Cuba produces no wine.    If alcohol was confiscated from your mother it is destroyed in front of her by breaking the seals and pouring it down the sink.  I dont think you are telling the whole story here.    If it is true that products were confiscated from your mother she will have been given the chance to pay the duty on the alchol and if she refused then the products are confiscated and destroyed so she will have a receipt of any action taken by customs.  if she wants tell her to get a lawyer and sue.    But you live in Florida for gods sake not communist russia the types of abuses of which you speak are non existant.|`|8kIE1Dswaa	Under OFAC rules, it is illegal to bring back anything from Cuba apart from information materials and artwork.     US Customs are legally entitled to seize anything brought back illegally.    About all you can do is appeal to your congressmen to change the law.    PS Cuba does produce wine - it's not very good, though. Casey - I am sure it is illegal to import any Cuban rum.|`|CW8tJeUJaa	You are talking nonsense   Like someone says Cuba does produce wine, but why buy it? Why would they take medication,  and please tell me where she bought the peppers from because we in Cuba can not buy these.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Obviously your mother would not tell lies.  it beats me why they would take the medication when it is of no use to them. I know that you are only allowed a limited amount of alcohol but they could have made her pay for it instead of taking all. As for the peppers you are not allowed to bring in those kind of stuff.  They should have sent her to get them checked.  Maybe they have something personal against Cuban residents or Cuba since they laughed as they did this.  That is not nice. You should be able to launch a report but you might be wasting your time.    Do not mind the people that are so negative and the ones that called her stupid.  Some people have nothing good to say about people.
RrEESD6Paa	I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!|`|S4z7mefcaa	Have you tried Cheaptickets.com?

feapxnJPaa	You can call 1-407-828-1000 and set up an audition for a character performer.  You do not have to be a current cast member to be a character, but they are very very picky.    1) You can apply online for clerical and administrative jobs.  For resort positions, you need to go to Casting which is across from DownTown Disney.    2) When you apply, you fill out an application, watch a video, and have an interview.  The whole process takes about 1 - 2 hours.  Depending on the recruiter and how many people they need to hire, you may know before you leave that day whether or not you have the job, or they may wait to call you.    3) It isn't too hard to get a job there.  Even if you don't speak good English, you can get a backstage job.  But don't think that being a maid is backstage.  At some of the resorts, the maids have parades in the afternoons and play with the kids there.    4) Experience helps, but your personality and smile is what they're looking for.|`|Ukh1zQhbaa	the disney world maid suck because when we were staying at the polynesian resort the left hair in our bath tub from the last guest|`|kLFsztSLaa	http://europesworld.info/
Qtys8AiTaa	ozmaniac is absolutely correct. All nationalities, other than New Zealand citizens must obtain an ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) prior to entering Australia.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	You can't have it both ways. Your need for a visa is based on the passport you enter the country on and you must enter on a valid NZ passport to be granted an SCV. Expired passports are not valid passports.    Enter on British passport = need visa.    http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets...    EDIT:  The other answerer is mistaken. You MUST have a visa for Australian before you arrive and you probably won't be allowed onto the plane without one as all of the airlines know that.  http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australi...|`|tT6psCPSaa	You can use your British passport to enter australia without applying for a visa beforehand. When you arrive and are going through customs they will grant you a 3 month holiday visa straight up. If you want to stay longer than 3 months suggest you get your New Zealand passport renewed, it should only take a few weeks.

PrsWmUSDaa	From Seattle WA to Atlanta GA is 2,650 miles and/or forty hours actual driving time.  If you drive ten hours a day, it will take four days.  If you drive thirteen hours a day, you can make it in three days.    I once drove straight through from Chicago to Albuquerque.  It was a stupid thing to do.

Jm3vMKx3aa	The previous answerer just seems to have forgotten that Belgium is tri-lingual (Dutch, French, German).    You will get the address of the town-hall (Gemeentehuis, Stadhuis, Hotel de Ville, Mairie, Ou du Bourgmestre, Gemeindehaus, Rathaus) if you just add the name of the town to your question. I am German and I am able to read and understand enough in Dutch and French since I have lived in Belgium for three years.|`|AA10973537	A town hall is a 'Gemeentehuis'.   Bigger towns will not have all services under on roof so it helps to know that records are kept at the 'Burgerlijke Stand' , The department is called 'Bevolking' or 'Bevolkingsregister'.    Towns are either a 'Gemeente' or a 'Stad'..  If you search with the name of the town you have it should give you an address or a phone number.    Alternatively you could put the name of the town on here and someone might come along and provide the right contact details.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Try entering the name of the town, Belgium in the search bar and see if the town has its own website.

AA11565538	Don't take pricey camera or video cameras. Be polite but at the same time don't let anyone take advantage of your politeness. Try not to carry many thing on you. You can even take a copy of your passport and a US id or US driver's license, it's better to lose you id or license than your passport. If anyone needs to see you age they can find it on the ID or DL. Watch out for the beggars, there are lots of them they will ask you for "One dollar" but if you keep giving them money you'll be broke. It is surely sad to see the poverty there but you will not solve the problem by giving them money, don't feel bad. While you don't go to dangerous places you'll be fine, stay in your group. <br>  When you go up to Cuzco and Macchu Picchu you'll have to get used to the height, try to drink 'mate de coca' (tea of coke leaves) it will help you a lot. The first days try to drink and use bottled water, when I went back there, even though I was born and raised in Peru I got sick from washing my teeth, maybe you'll be luckier!<br>  In Lima try to stay with your group too, I don't know where you're staying but try to take yellow color taxi cabs and not the informal ones.

It's surrounded by development of other commercial interests. It's surprising just how little space there is, and you do feel a little jammed up.    Disney World is much more spread out.

That is the older mentality. The thing is that some Costa Ricans feel that theyre jobs are being taken for cheaper labor by Nicaraguans, since we are right next too each other and the jobs in CR pay a lot better than in Nicaragua, we get hundreads of Nicas coming in illegaly every single day. We count that CR has a population of 4. something million but in reality if you count all the immigrants that are living here from Nicaragua, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba, Panam and even USA, the population is a lot bigger than what we think it is. Since this country has had uninterrupted democracy for more than 50 years and it doesnt have a military its a peacefull place and the economy is growing, a lot of immigrants come to live here because a comfortable life can be lived here. But Nicaraguans have been coming here for years, since they had the bad civil war 20 years ago a lot would come here to escape the war. Also Nicaragua and CR had a war about 100 years ago when William Walker, a american guy that was trying to turn Central America into a slave state took over and became president of Nicaragua, when he tried taking over Costa Rica we had to fight back and we didnt let him take over CR and the people that lived in Guanacaste did not want to be part of William Walker, Guanacaste was part of Nicaragua but when that battle happened, Guanacaste became a Costa Rican province so Nicaraguans have beenm mad at CR for years because of that war but they dont remember that the people from Guanacaste didnt want to be ruled by William Walker, a crazy southern slave trading clown. So Nicas and Costa Ricans have aways had a wierd love and hate relationship but Nicas dont need a visa to come here but Costa Ricans do need a visa to go to Nicaragua, the nicaraguan goverment does not like Costa RIca but CR has been pretty nice to Nicas, especially when they were at war.|`|p55JnISnaa	That's the exact same problem with Hondurans and Salvadoranians.

Some people dont like them because of the problems asociated with them like poverty, crime bad habits, that of course is not a general rule but the bad ones make a bad name for the good ones.

Also, many bring trouble- like drugs- into the country.  also, this may have a bit of relevancy. most nicas who come to cr have darker skin. so sometimes if a tico gets mad at someone who is darker, they might call them nica.|`|LJJ38fVKaa	It's the SAME THING that happens with AMERICANS and MEXICANS...    Nicas come to Costa Rica illegally and a lot of them just come to do bad things like robbery and murder (not all of them... I know some nicas that are hard-working and friendly)  Don't respect the Costa Rican laws, and if you watch the Costa Rican news channels you'll see that most of the bad things that happen in Costa Rica is because of Nicaraguans!!! :-( almost the 90%!!!    also they take Costa Ricans' Jobs!    and the WORST of it all is that all the money they make in Costa Rica they send it to Nicaragua!! so they are making the Costa Rican Economy to go down... it's not balanced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    also they live in ugly weird "houses" that are taking over the neighborhoods so they're making a lot of places in CR ugly looking! ):-(    LIKE MEXICANS going to the US to find the AMERICAN DREAM... NICARAGUANS come to COSTA RICA to FIND the COSTA RICAN DREAM!! LOL!    so yeah... THAT's WHY    is not that Ticos are racist is just that this outsiders are messing with the country that took natives a lot of years and efford to build!!!!    as I said... just like Americans feel about Mexicans..... Is NOT Racism!|`|6V78IwNCaa	Latin America is traditionally one of the most racist regions of the world.  The whiter the better!  They grade skin color on like 16 levels and have a name for all of them.  Colonization and oppression can breed amazing culture and people, but also a little ignorance too.  Most Costa Rican's see it as just a neighborly rivalry these days, but like anywhere, there are some ignorant people too.

It takes time to plan the big wedding.  And, note, the engagement period is considered after the marriage contract has been done but the marriage hasn't been consummated and they aren't living together.  During the time before the big wedding, the couple doesn't normally go out alone, but they do talk on the phone and visit each other's families to get to know one another better.  They can always decide to not go through with the marriage, and if so, then neither one has lost anything.  Here, it's very hard for women to get married again if they've been married before (like already consummated the marriage).|`|3Gh2WqjJaa	Depends on which wife your talking about lol jk jk ;)|`|UhnvXXxjaa	we use a formula to calculate the period between the two events, no one else would describe it here better than me:  the bride's Weight divided by her age times the root of the groom's age over his hight minus 3.14 = the period between engagement and wedding.      KHUDAFIS|`|uvx3cnkJaa	in Saudi, there are families that like to do the 'milka' right after the bride approves of the groom and of the marriage because they think it's best to make things 'Halal' where the bride and groom can go out together, be seen in public together as a couple, dine out, ... etc. These families tend to me the more 'religious' type.    There are the other less 'religious' ones who have the engagement and go out and do all of the above without a milka; and it's seems to be ok within the family because they're all not very keen on the whole 'do the milka quickly' idea and think the couple should know more of each other before they decide to either stay together or call the whole engagement off.    There's the third type that have the engagement and wait a couple of weeks up to two months and then have the milka, and during that time the couple speak on the phone but don't go out together alone and if the groom wants to see his bride, one member of the bride's family needs to sit with them 'usually a little annoying brother'.     My personal preference is the third type in which the bride can have some time to think the marriage through  'alone without pressure of wearing makeup and going out with her groom', also to have time to prepare for the milka 'buy the dress and what not' and also time to diet (if she needs to shed down a couple of kilos and drop a dress size or two to fit her milka dress and look like a princess)!|`|dp2Rocjraa	well eag G explained it the best ...  btw wolf ,, loool . i assure you not all of them think that way .|`|3uRie2GAaa	lol i believe they cant go out till they do the "Melkah" thingy so they can be considered as married ppl, yeah thats wt i know|`|CLZQOnZ4aa	Nowadays, if the bride still studying, in school or collage, they would rather to set the wedding after she done.

hs9Mibf5aa	Hi :)    Well the forecast is calling for some more warmer temp.'s than we've been having, -5, - 8, etc. (compared to -22 C)! So that's one good thing.    And the 1st person obviously doesn't live here because they resolved the Transit Strike on Friday (Jan. 30th).  The buses - the main ones that you need anyways, - are due to be up and running again within 10 days so you can get around.  So by the time you get here, you'll be seeing a lot of happy Transit Riders.  And we are NOT boring! :)    I don't know where you're coming from, but bring a) long johns, and/or leg warmers.. tees to put under your sweaters.    Colourful sweaters, jeans, cords.. a decent ski jacket, and in case it warms up more than that, bring some layers, i.e. some sweaters with openings/buttons, or even faux wool shawls and capes - they're back in style, and not too expensive.  You can get one here.      And of course - a scarf, gloves or mittens, and boots. -As 'matched' as possible of course, we do have style here :)    Just assume it'll be cold, and hope it won't!  You'll be safe that way, and with layers, you can take off clothes instead of needing some.    Cheers, C'kins :)|`|biF7sad1aa	Take some books to read. It's the most boring city on earth.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	There are all sorts of subculture fashion styles, but traditional European dress is somewhat classy and subdued. If you descibe your normal style as classy, I'd stick to this. Neutral and classic colors, fitted/tailored styles, a bit dressy. The US preppy style doesn't really exist over here, it looks very obviously "American", but classy works anywhere.    People wear all sorts of clothes (including the things I'm about to list), but if you aren't familiar with local styles and HOW to wear them, it's best to avoid the following unless you want to look like a tourist:  -white trainers/sneakers  -shorts (and short skirts in Rome)  -khaki  -tshirts/polo-type shirts  -visible brands or large slogans  -baggy clothes    And a tip: Nice boots or comfortable dress shoes are best. Heels are common but if you aren't used to walking on cobblestones, leave them at home. Your feet will make you miserable by the end of the trip.    I don't know what your dresses look like, but I wear a dress pretty much everyday, wherever I'm going. I love her blog for dress fashion:  http://ambugaton.blogspot.com/    The Sartorialist has great examples of classy European street fashion, be sure to look through the archived months:  http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/    Some high street shops to give you ideas of current fashion:  http://www.topshop.com  http://www.next.co.uk/  http://www.hm.com/gb/    In my experience, American spend a lot more time on their hair than Europeans. Long and a bit wavy is good, or loosely fastened up. Look at the above links for ideas.    Hope this helps :)|`|hMNClFh9aa	well its hard to answer all of them ill just write so you know what you could expect in the terms of weather, not fashion     In London - its rainy all year and in mid March its still cold outside. you should get a good coat or something. expect the temperature to be around 10 degrees Celsius which is 52 in Fahrenheit  Paris - could be a bit better, around 57 Fahrenheit   Rome - here probably..temperatures can be very pleasant this time of the  year. it shouldn't be cold, though it can still be chilly in the evenings or  when the day is cloudy..you could expect around 72 Fahrenheit or so during a nice day

ncojw5ttaa	Salem, MA has a pirate museum. I went in 7th grade so I don't remember much, but I remember having fun!    "A 20- to 30-minute walking tour, where you'll meet some 60 buccaneers from the days of yore, and you'll behold their artifacts and treasures. Visit a recreated dockside village, board a pirate ship and meander an eighty-foot batcave, filled with hidden booty. These pirates, and not accused witches, were the real rascals and villains of 1692 in Olde Salem Towne."    Check out the website: http://www.piratemuseum.com/pirate.html  They also have hand outs under the "Education Curriculum" section for all different grade levels. Hope this helps!|`|AA11732565	I think your best bet would be to head to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem where they have a focus on maritime "arts". There is a Whaling Museum in New Bedford but they may be too far. I'm not sure where exactly you are travelling from but I think Salem will be within your travel range. I would call the Museum's Education Department to discuss just what you'd like to see - they have a great reputation for developing special programs. The PEM is beautiful  too boot. My only other advice is to either pack lunches or eat somewhere else as it is very expensive to eat in their restaurant.  Sounds like fun!|`|UrXR6LGraa	Go to Salem, they have been conscientiously re-branding themselves from "the witch town" to "the witch and pirate town.

Btw, if we can't speak  greek language, we can also be easily  mistaken when trying to read the writings on the bottle...    I just can say that Greeks have very good wine and alcohols...  You should also taste Ouzo, with fish, cheese and watermellons, that's so delicious.    ps :I mean fish OR white Feta cheese and watermellons, of course...

Possibly an equivalent of Lacryma Christi is produced on Crete, but then it's not a true Lacryma Christi (just like champagne produced in California isn't a "true" champagne). Crete does have its very own unique wines, don't know why your friend didn't buy you any of those. Well, anyway, it's the thought that counts, right?

16HpjVscaa	Adelaide  is a good “medium” sized city,  what I like about Adelaide includes,  it’s unpretentious people, it's laid back, it's quality life style, lack of traffic jams,  it's clean air, crisp blue skies, parklands, well laid out planning, unspoilt relatively quite beaches, the proximity to the Hills and their villages, the variety of relatively inexpensive dining, it's Art's festivals, culture, it's relative low crime rate, the charm of the inner-city districts and heritage stone buildings...well that’s a start.<br>  <br>  What are your thoughts on Adelaide Suave–cat, since moving there?<br>  <br>  (SC: sure, the "greater" metropolitan road systems, esp. travelling along N-S during peak hours can be frustrating at times, though it seems the Government is (slowly) trying to address this (though it still pales compared with east coast cities’ traffic jams).

I have also lived in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and in the USA so I am not biased because I was born and raised here. It is a lovely place to live with a lot of parks, beautiful beaches, plenty of markets and stores, great tourist attractions such as our wineries and festivals and a lot of sporting matches and attractions. We are very welcoming here and are extremely multicultural and cosmopolitan. Adelaide has many galleries and is heavily into the Arts. We are called the City of Churches but we are also known as the Festival City as we have a Festival of the Arts every two years and many other festivals at other times. We have just held a major bicycle race here with Lance Armstrong in attendance. Our climate can be hot in summer and cold and rainy in winter but the temperature is mostly warm and sunny. My husband is American and has never had a problem living here..he loves it. Come and see for yourself...you wont want to leave.

It will ask you depart dates and what airports you will be using. Then check all those boxes and press search. All the different prices will come up. Also, you can go to AA.com. That's American Airlines. The best in my opinion.     Oh and flying is scary. I hate it. But others don't mind. Also, check baggage information before you show up at any airport. They usually have rules on what you can bring on board. And depending on how heavy your bag is, you might have to pay extra.    Good Luck

pE72aA7oaa	It's very possible but these days it's just one of many locations a hidden camera can be. Most cameras actually have a difficult time recording through a 2 way mirror unless the target is very brightly lit. The fact that bathrooms usually have brighter, whiter light makes it an ideal location however.    In general two-way mirrors can be seen through in both directions. Sometimes it is possible to take a look through two-way mirrors the wrong way by shielding the surrounding light from the mirror. Whether this works largely depends on the density of the reflective coating and the light levels at the viewers side of the mirror.    Because not all of the light that hits the mirror is reflected, two-way mirrors appear to be darker than usual mirrors. However this should not be relied upon when looking for two-way mirrors. Because the density of the reflective coating can be chosen freely there is no definite value to distinguish two-way mirrors from regular ones. If the attacker wants to make sure the mirror is not suspected to be a two-way mirror he will choose more dense coatings but this will result in a visible loss of picture quality.    If you have a concern I would recommend products that can detect hidden cameras in both wireless and wired form in any location. There are many to choose from and are priced accordingly by quality and features.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I'd like to find one because if I did I would put up a big complaint and take it to the Police and newspapers.

BAlYRNN8aa	I guess i would be classed as a "boy racer" i have a turbo charged car and im young.  I am not in chch though;    I have owned a turbo charged car since i was 17, never had any problems, never been stopped, no speeding tickets, nothing...    In fact im glad that police and other authorities are cracking down on these idiots.  There is absolutely no excuss for anyone to attack a police officer or anyone!  It is a small minority of these 15 year old tards in the car that Mum and Dad brought them for passing their learners exam; they can hardly even drive yet they have these powerfull turbo charged cars.  The parents need to be locked up too.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	They are a bunch of tossers.

DisdrG4Taa	Rivercenter is a nice place to have lunch at the food court and listen to the Andean Fusion Music, and a good place to get away from the Riverwalk crowd for a while, but otherwise it is not, generally considered a place to shop for clothing.  This is part of the reason that Dillard's closed their store as the hub store for the mall.  The larger malls such as North Star, Ingram, Rolling Oaks and La Cantera have a much better selection if you choose to shop in a mall setting.  In most cases, I prefer to go to individual stores with higher quality clothing, which are not located in the malls.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	Honey, the RiverCenter Mall is mainly designed for tourists...locals shop elsewhere!|`|AvxMhVGmaa	Last I heard, that place was going to get a major face lift!|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	Hmmm what is san antonio and texass, please explain.

szPacUYJaa	You could try taking four A-levels, but if you find it a struggle and feel you could only get three As then drop one. It probably won't matter whether you get AAAB because you have already met their general requirement of AAA (but the B does kind of ruin it...).    All Oxford cares is that you have the potential and motivation for their course and that you meet the requirements for a subject and level. It states on their website that conditional offers for A-level students are likely to be AAA, that is providing that any specific subject requirements have been met.    http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergrad...

OocDN5evaa	You answered the question yourself....because it's a day that marks a terrible day for the aboriginals. There are other reasons as well.    Many of the millions of Australians who are not of British heritage are also likely to find another day more meaningful. I also dont see why a nation which has become independent from the country which colonised them would celebrate their national day on the anniversary of colonisation. Most other nations with this sort of history celebrate on the date of independence, not the day of colonisation.    But I guess the date when Australia came into existence as a country - January 1st 1901- would probably not be supported as Australia Day, because we already have a public holiday on that day, and they wouldnt lose a public holiday.     We could then have another day as Australia Day. Apart from January 1st as the anniversary of Federation, some have suggested 27th May as the anniversary of the 1967 referendum which enabled Aboriginal people to be counted in the national census.  Australian football legend Ron Barassi has expressed support for this date.    Personally, I support May 27.|`|CwrayzxBaa	The government has already clearly stated that Australia day will remain where it is on Jan 26.   There are some pretty good reasons for moving it though:    1. It only breeds resentment and bad feelings amongst Aboriginal Australians as they then have to "celebrate" the systematic destruction of their culture and society.   Moving the day would have a positive effect on reconciliation.    2. Australia day celebrates British colonialism and not the birth of the Australian nation.       3. Australia day tends to be Sydney-centric.  All the big celebrations are held in Sydney while the rest of Australia takes it as just another long weekend.   The day is made largely irrelevant to the rest of Australia.    4.  We are a nation of immigrants.   Australia day doesn't recognise the contributions of the Chinese, Italians, Greeks, Vietnamese and many other groups that have come to make Australia their home.   It only seems to celebrate an Anglo-centric view of Australia.    There are other days better suited to celebrating Australia's nationhood.  I would suggest Federation day (Jan 1), the day Captain Cook first discovered Australia (at least he was considered a great humanitarian), or the day Queen Victoria signed the constitution into being which in turn made Australia an independent country.    Whatever day we go with, it must be inclusive of all Australians and not just those with a British heritage.  We certainly can't begin to reconcile our past unless we begin to fix up the wrongs being done right now.  Kevin might say never, but he answers to the Australian people.  If they decide a change is in order then it will happen, with or without him.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	They're not thinking about changing the date. Kevin Rudd said an unequivocal NO when asked if the government would consider changing it and he left no room for discussion or argument. Well done Kevin!    In any case, Mick Dodson (current Australian of the Year), the person who was responsible for raising the question this year, said on the 7.30 Report within hours of doing so "Yes. I don't have a strong view about this one way or another as to whether it be the 26th of January or some other day. I don't have a problem with the 26th of January, but some people do."  http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2008/...     It's a media beatup but some of the aboriginal industry has jumped on the bandwagon to give them yet another 'issue' to use to divide public opinion. Idiots that they are, they can't or won't see that bullshit like that simply distracts everyone from actually doing something to change things that really need to be changed like aboriginal health, education, living conditions and a hundred other far more important problems.    Ignore it - it won't happen.|`|2BUCOTaJaa	the abo's or aboriginal people think its invasion day so there offended by it.|`|j981yGvDaa	well  the aboriginals were there first  and when the white man came (jan 26) they got treated like animals  and the abroiginals are the true owners of aus,  so they think that it is a horrible day for them|`|wuIxDbosaa	Well if you wanted to get technical about it, why not 1770 when Cook first came by, or much earlier when the Dutch landed here?    Jan 26 was the establishment of the Sydney colony and there are many places across Australia that were considered unsuitable for colonisation or not worthy of the effort, eg NT, WA, SA.  It wasn't until the French started showing an interest in the West Coast that the English put an effort in towards colonising the place.  The Swan River Colony didn't come about until 1826 and WA has its own Foundation Day celebrations.    As for redhzkinswood (oh god not the kingswood), you my little friend really do need further education, at last count there are millions of Indigenous people left in South, North & Central America.      Some South American countries actually have Indigenous people as a President or senior politicians, very very rare in Australia.  Eventually these American countries came to embrace and include Indigenous people in a way Australians just don't understand, which says a lot about how much we have to learn about what it means to be a nation.    The colonists in Australia were not above genocide, which is well documented in colonial journals, court documents and newspapers of the time.  Australian Aboriginal tribes were decimated with a rabid fervour by colonists.  I wouldn't be bragging about the benefits of British colonisation when it is so well documented that in many cases it was the complete opposite.    The suggestion that the abuse suffered by Aboriginal people in this country is so far in the past that its not worth noting, should also apply to ANZAC Day, I mean none of the current generation were there or made a contribution to our soldiers efforts at the time.  Or is it just a case of selective memory?  This sh!t was still happening in the 1970's and 1980's, so deal with it!    When Australia Day represents ALL Australian states and territories, when Australia Day represents ALL Australians (and lets not forget that there were thousands of Chinese here at the start of colonisation who aren't recognised for their contributions) and when Australia Day is not used as an excuse for racists to vent at non-whites, then maybe we might have something to celebrate.|`|4DkvfWjaaa	The Government has already rejected the idea of Australia day changing. so that's out of the way ...    But, there thinking about changing it because although the Aboriginals want to celebrate it. It's hard for them, because they have to remember what their elders and the generations before them went through.    But Kevin Rudd has already rejected the idea.|`|vOnzG05Qaa	You have answered your own question. Its because the Aboriginal people find it offensive to celebrate the day that white man arrived & took their land & killed alot of their people.  But non-aboriginal Australians consider it the day the country was discovered & should be celebrated as our day.|`|NuUMDTrTaa	All I can say is it is very lucky for the Aboriginals that it was the British who colonised the Country and not the French, Spanish, Portuguese and the rest of those that caused so much death and genocide in South America.   The Brits were far and away the best thing that happened to the Aborigine, and they should be thankful for it.|`|SHm5DfRiaa	because australia day then the whole world has to be australian.  so they said better not|`|AI2SRjLaaa	It marked the day when we stopped being hunter gathers and began to live in permanent settlements....

Fire ants - They have a nasty bite and are noticeable by their big sand mounds.    Roaches/Palmetto bugs - Can be found year round but are more prevalent if you keep a messy house and they don't like the cold so they'll try to get inside during the chilly months.    Spiders - There's various kinds (even black widows) but they eat mosquitos and are mostly beneficial.    Wasps - I've mostly noticed the type that build mud nests against your house. Just keep your house clear of the nests and they won't set up shop.    Love bugs - Harmless but annoying.

5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	I think all this ultimately comes down to how good the airline is(ie whether they value customer service).    I believe that the airline that the person was stuck in was horrible. She should have been more demanding. Then they would at least pay for the free hotel stay and compensate you for your loss(eg. 200bucks for a day so if its 2 days, its 200bucks).     Depending on the situation, they would usually try to put you on the next available flight to your destination(even if its not the same airline). If they couldnt get anything on the same day, they would advise you to check in a hotel and go back the next day. Some stupid airlines wont offer anything unless you get demanding.    Sometimes the airline would also reroute you like let you transit in some other airport again but will eventually reach the destination.    It is actually not their fault if your layover is too short unless its due to their 1st flight delay. When purchasing the ticket, you should be aware of such situation and plan the trip accordingly.

PnMtlZ0Yaa	It is about 1875 miles. Driving is over 28 hours. The bus is likely double that. Flying is usually not a lot more expensive than the bus. It takes hours instead of days, so you don't feel like you smell when you arrive.     Driving depends on a few things: How new/reliable/well maintained is your car? Since Arizona is not a mass transit town, a car is needed once you are there to get around. How long are you staying? Is renting a car an option?|`|fIK9LBEuaa	That depends. I'm not sure what your going there for, but if you drive then you can have your car while you are in Arizona, unless you're taking a cab or renting a car. And also it would cost more in gas, unless you already calculated it.     And also if you take a bus, you don't have to worry about getting tired when your driving or anything else like that. So, you probably wouldn't have to spend money on a hotel if you needed too.    If it was myself, I would drive there. But that's just because I'm more comfortable in my own car following my own schedule. But, if you feel a greyhound bus would be better, then go for it    Have fun! :)|`|RtQaCYUuaa	run there

As Beardo said, you're not going to easily find things like this unless you are dealing with the black market.  Most don't go to Cuba for a shopping trip...if you want to do shopping, the best things to buy is their handcrafted items, leather, art items, rum, silver/shell jewellery.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	What the rest said is true.  Cuba is not really a shopping destination but ou should try Miami, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten or Margarita.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Knock-off's you are not going to Hong Kong here buddy this is a Socialist country under a us embargo the people are lucky to have what they do and to make what they don't have.

6egxGam6aa	Once you get the hang of it, changing planes isn't very hard at all.    Step by step, here's what you do:    1. When you land in the airport, look for a flight status board or a gate agent right away. Check on the status (on time, delayed, etc.) and gate number/terminal to make sure there haven't been any changes.  2. If you have some time to spare, grab a snack, use the restroom, recheck the flight status and gate number, and then proceed to step 3.  3. Go to your gate. Note that this may mean changing terminals. Airports generally have signs overhead to guide passengers, but if you think you'll need specific directions (or you just want to make sure you're in the right place), don't hesitate to ask an airline employee.  4. Once you get to your gate, check the flight status again (changes happen often and are updated frequently).  5. Wait near the gate until your flight begins to board (and I cannot stress this enough - keep an eye on the gate and flight status. Even if you're at the gate for your flight, it is still subject to change).  6. Repeat at the next layovers until you reach your destination.    If you have any concerns or questions, consult an airline employee in the airport.    I hope this has helped. Have a great trip!|`|tt08Ve96aa	it will be a bit challenging, make sure you know what gate your connecting flight is in before you get off your flight before, and ask for help once on the airport, and make sure you be careful with your time, you don't want to miss a connecting flight|`|zRPAem3Saa	all you do is sit in the airport and wait until your next flight leaves    lets say you have a layover in Dallas (or somewhere) on your way to Miami    lets say you arrive at Dallas 4:00 at gate F3, lets say your connection is at 7:00 at gate B14 or somesuch    you just sit around for 3 hours and make sure you're at gate B14 when your flight boards    difficult, no  boring, yes|`|HgiTzTaxaa	Sometimes it can be.

d9MjpkK4aa	Friendliness is a game of give and take, you know, and at first you have to give. Then stay in contact with the persons you like and leave the rest alone, just like you would do it in America.   And moreover you will need four things: a work permit, a residence permit, a home, and a job. If you are unlucky, this can become a story of the kind you call a catch-22. You must know that even way too many natives without any cultural or language problems are unemployed for months and years.   Give it a try, if you are optimistic and lion-hearted, but take care of your money, and DON'T burn the bridges behind you.
sjWBmBTCaa	Why on earth would you want to chew tobacco. It looks disgusting. I bet that you are from the southern states of america.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	In Australia, the sale of oral snuff and chewing tobacco was banned nationally in 1991. It's a restricted import, but only in quantities over 1.5kg.    Please don't use it here. We have no spittoons or even ashtrays in any public areas so what are you going to do with it after you've chewed it. It's simply not something that's done here.|`|vgNELAQIaa	Culturally, Australians compare chewing and spitting tobacco in par with urinating in public.    You will only find it in specialist tobacco shops and not many of them carry it at all.    Tobacco products are a dutiable item. You will have limits on what you can bring in, or have to pay the duty on over that amount which will probably cost you double what you buy you Copenhagen for at home. Failure to declare could have you not only lose your tobacco, but also pay a hefty fine.      It's legal, but cultural unacceptable here. I am in the Northern Territory and am aware that under the Summary Offences Act, spitting tobacco juice is against the law. (Up to $2,000 or six months jail maximum penalty, but most likely an on the spot fine of $100) Do you swallow?

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	For a number of reasons, we get a bunch of questions asking what its really like in Los Angeles.    First of all, I'll tell you what it's NOT like: It's not like anything on TV. People watch shows on TV and think thats what its like out here. The Real OC, Newport Beach, The Hills, etc. Ever wonder why people in those shows never have to pay bills, do laundry, and are NEVER stuck in traffic? Because its FAKE. And the news doesnt help either, since they know that sex and sensationalism sells. News flash: There arent running gun battles in the street. There arent shootouts every day. Also, you dont see celebrities just walking down the street, all glammed up, or sipping a cappuccino at Starbucks waiting to sign autographs. We don't go surfing during lunch hour.     Some sections are REALLY nice, others are ghetto. Too many people have this vision in their head that LA is one or the other (either Beverly Hills or Compton). In fact, most of it is working class and middle class stiffs working to pay the bills.    You NEED a car to live in Southern California. We dont have an effective public transportation like New York or San Francisco. One reason is that LA is larger in area than either of those, without a central hub where everything is. Back in the 1960s, we might have done it. But by the time local governments got their act together, it was much more difficult to make a working public transit system. Also, unlike NY, we have earthquakes, which make it a little more difficult to build underground.     The freeway traffic is probably the worst thing about living here. The 405 is the worst. Know why they call it the 405? Because you go 4 o' 5 miles per hour, and it takes 4 o' 5 hours to get where you're going. Freeway Traffic is bad from 6-10 AM and bad from 3-7 PM. I don't know why they call it rush hour. It's more than an hour, and nobody's rushing, that's for sure.    The gangs are the cause of many rumors. Keep in mind that there are gangs in any large town, in every part of the country. In LA, the gangs aren't really downtown, they are in South LA, East LA, and north Long Beach (an extension of the South LA gangs, actually). And here's the deal: Mostly, they just kill each other.    Gas is expensive in California. Its about 20-30 cents above the national average.     Yes, gas and real estate are very expensive in SoCal. However, this would be the best time to BUY a house because it's a buyer's market right now. There are a lot of foreclosures, and too many houses on the market.     Yep, freeways are a drag, it's smoggy in summer, and expensive to live here. Yet, if it's so bad, why do we have thousands and thousands of people moving here?     Weather, Activities, Plenty of jobs, Beaches, mountains, deserts all within driving distance, and plenty of opportunity for those who have the skills and tenacity.    In colder parts of the country, people keep their cars in their garages all winter. Kids get snow toys for Christmas. Here, kids get BIKES, scooters, and skateboards. 10 AM Christmas morning, the streets are FULL of kids on their new bikes, scooters, etc.     The job market is good here, mainly because there are SO many people here that it creates its own job market. Then there are MANY industries, including tourism, entertainment, shipping, manufacturing, etc. Its an incredible economy.    However, it is not for everyone. Every time someone posts this question, you get the LA haters who post their bile and venom. A lot of them dont know what they are talking about. Some people never even visit, and hate it on principle and stereotypes. Some actually visited once, and found out it wasnt like it was on TV, and it certainly wasnt Mayberry. And some actually lived here, and couldnt deal with the expense, the traffic, or the somewhat impersonal nature of living in a large metropolis. To those I would say good luck to you wherever you are, but please dont spew your hatred in this forum.     As for lifestyle, its rather casual. You work during the week, and then go do something fun on the weekend, so that you can impress your coworkers around the water cooler on Monday.     To summarize, LA a HUGE metropolis that really defies easy description. I live in one of the nicer suburbs, but the commute is no fun, often 1-2 hours each way each day. However, 340+ days of sunshine really helps. Yeah, it's expensive. Mrs. Obviousman and I both have to work to pay the mortgage. But is it worth it? You bet!    Not a good time for bartenders, though. All the wannabe actors are bartenders already.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	With the way the economy is going, I HIGHLY wouldn't recommend for you to out west.|`|AA10087814	Pros:  Great weather            Good beaches            Laid-back atmosphere            Disneyland            Hollywood & Beverly Hills            Big Bear     Cons: Bad traffic            Underfunded schools            Garbage in Streets            Crime/gangs    Just remember when you move to LA, the problems you encounter there are typical of alot of US cities because of today's economy.  If you do plan to be a bartender, there are alot of good nightclubs and bars in LA, mostly on the Sunset Strip or in Santa Monica.  You can also try San Francisco or San Diego.

They only worship one God. Statues are mostly images of saints who play a role in the whole Church as they are still part of the Body of Christ, the Church. The saints have intercessory powers and help those who are still living here on earth. Through their prayers they are able to seek favors from Christ and God for the benefit of those who pray to them. The bowing is just incidental to the praying process and does not signify worship. Maybe reverence. The statues are there to remind people of the saints' lives, deeds, and other works. Miracles and other acts have been attributed as answers to prayers and petitions. People who believe in prayers ask other people to pray for them or for their intentions. Why nor ask the saints for the same since they are still part of the Church and are already before God; closer to Him.     People visit the statue of Abraham Lincoln in Washington and stand or sit before him not to worship but to remember what he has done for the country. People remember his greatness and probably thank him   for what he has done. Some may bow their heads while remembering him. The statue is there to remind people how he looked like or just a symbol of presence. Or people visit Lenin's tomb in the Kremlin to remember his greatness and some leave flowers not as offerings but part of their admiration. Others bow their heads in the process.     Filipino Catholics and for that matter all Catholics do the same with pictures, icons, relics, and  other items related to saints.|`|eZ2tQY53aa	I could care less about statues of anything..i know it in my heart that Im a believer.|`|x7pvACBWaa	Well, Im Filipino and that's the way things are in my country. That being not a bad thing as you so imply. I travel overseas frequently and notice how masses are held just once every sunday, whereas we have multiple masses held in every church (within five miles of each other), most of them six to eight times on sunday, each mass filled out over capacity. In that context the Catholic faith is alive and well over here compared to the first world, where most of the time half the pews are empty on that one sunday mass. I believe that faith is not measured by paying homage to images or not doing so. To each their own. Why dont you stick to what works in your neck of the woods and leave us be in ours. Im sure if you really told us what you are and where youre from, just as you have singled our people out, that we would see how much more morally imperfect you and your band is.

Why this polemics..just respect the tradition and values of others!!!|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Filipinos do these because:    1) It is the tradition of Filipinos to bow down to saints and to treat the statues of saints with particular reverence as if it were God Himself. Some don't mean to treat the statues as God but some do. Either way, it is because they are Roman Catholics and you, sir, are probably Russian Orthodox.    2) 92% of all Filipinos are classified by Operation World as "Pagano-Christianity". Most really do not practice Catholicism in its pure and perfect form, and a majority do believe in horoscopes, amulets, shamans, witches, spiritism, and a whole plethora of semi-dieties. Again, this is part of Philippine culture. With this, the widespread belief and reverence that Filipinos hold for the statues of the Virgin Mary and of the Son Jesus (Santo Nino) are due in part to their own animistic background, which, I reiterate, has NOT been eradicated by the three centuries of Spanish rule.    3) Only Protestants and Charismatic Catholics in the Philippines do NOT worship the saints. If we quantify Christianity as the Christianity as is practiced in its original and pure form, then Christianity would only claim about 15% of the Philippine population.     4) NOT ONLY Filipinos, other Asians too, such as the East Timorese, despite their 98% Catholic adherence, are also classified as "Pagano-Christians" because they also believe in magic and quasi-deities as Filipinos do. Again, this is a cultural thing. Vietnamese and Indian Catholics do the same thing too.|`|UofhMpy9aa	my personal faith is solely based in the bible. i myself have read the book several times (I'm not a catholic), and for a fact, without a doubt i could claim that God was, and, is against idolatry in all forms..and that he is a JEALOUS GOD (Joshua 24:19, Exodus 20:4-5) - and honestly, i pretty much understand how God feels about idolatry.    if i see my boyfriend kissing another girl, i would be angry - and if he would tell me that the kiss was intended for me, because he was ACTUALLY thinking of me while he was kissing the other girl, i'd be doubly pissed off. i guess, it'd be just the same in bowing down in front of an image of a different entity, while thinking of worshipping the true God.    what i understand about the verses that had introduced the true God, He is in spirit form, thus cannot be seen, and therefore, his image cant be captured.    well, that's my PERSONAL faith.No offense meant to those who believe otherwise.|`|CNotcjbaaa	I dont understand why Catholics would deny that they worship images, do kneeling, praying, bowing down in front of statues doesn't look like worshipping? Read your own catholic books and doctrines. Catholics see and worship their god in the Eucharist believing it has the power to wipe away their sins (Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 1394).     Yes, we kneel and cross ourselves in front of the Eucharist, because Jesus is present there. We may kneel in front of other statues and images, because they remind us of our Lord, Lady, & other saints. That makes us want to pray.    They see and eat the Eucharist believing they have consumed the physical body and blood of Jesus (CCC, 1377).     Yes, that is what Jesus revealed in the Bible.    They see and confess to their priest believing he has the power to forgive sins (CCC, 1461).     John 20:21-23: "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you." and when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained."    They see and bow down to statues believing the saints, who are represented, will intercede for them (CCC, 2683).  It is like when I get my father to ask for things. My little brother is cute and sweet, and has a way with my father.     They see and feel rosary beads believing their repetitious prayers to Mary will remit punishment for sin (CCC, 1471).   The beads just help us keep track. Praying, God says, is a what to do penance for sin.     Catholics are also told in the Canon Law that worshipping is wrong. Anyone who does it is in a state of Mortal Sin.     Kthxbai-|`|rVUvopaLaa	thanks of your interest in the Cathlic faith.    firstly,  images are NOT being worship by the Cathlic faith.  it is not part of the teachings.      Catholics VENERATE the holy images meaning it is the expression of RESPECT.      for example i'm sure in your wallet right now you have pictures of your love one or family.  you keep it in you because you love them or him/her right?  when you miss them whenever you are far away travelling for instance you also kiss the picture right?  that is your expression of your love.  isn't it?    now among filipinos why they tend to overly do it and as you said "worship", it is the person's act and they are responsible for it BUT it doesn't necessarily mean that's what the Catholic faith is teaching.  in other words that's how they express their love according to their own personal convicttion.      now in the Catholic faith since we can not see the image of Jesus.  for us to express our love/respect we venerate the image that symbolises Jesus.  in other words it is not the image per se but how we express the faith, love and respect.      i don't want to quote the bible not because i knew nothing i just leave it to the experts, the qualified and trained individuals.  for many want to interpret the Holy Bible yet things get wrong.  it is correct you just quoted the old testament while the Catholic relies the New Testament that describes the life, death, teachings and passion of Jesus.    one of the beauty of the Catholic faith they have high level of tolerance from other faith no matter how they were criticised, mocked  and rudely attrack the Catholic faith yet it continued to exist for more than 2000 years.  the Catholic faith have NO business attracking other religion for the Catholic faith is founded with love, peace, joy and hope.  the Catholic faith have high regard with other faith even to the non Christians. in fact whenever a Pope passed away leaders from other Christian faith pays respect.  the Catholic faith strongly believe in co-existence.      good day and may you have a blessed Sunday!    Farticus:  did he said he's a Catholic?  well anyone can say that of course like you said right now    Ann C:  that's why he is God because he doesn't think the way we do.  i don't think He's a jealous type of God.  don't you think?    finally, if you STRONGLY believe your are CORRECT and your religion is the most perfect, appropriate, spotless and truly divine ever then good on you.  just pray for us then. hope that atttitude will bring you a comfortable space in heaven.  let's all have a life.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	it's called tradition...|`|kFq62tBpaa	don't you ask me about my religions? by the way, my religions are  judaism , christian and islam. the three authentic regions, from Abraham, Christ, down to Mohammad.     sorry, i don't believe cult such as born again..........|`|Irjopfpvaa	I think the answer to your question is: to each his own.    Catholicism is an old religion, awashed with centuries old traditions, many adopted from pagan rituals.     I believe you are not the first "heretic" who criticized the Church. Before you there's the Protestants and other small denominations who have successfully separated and follows their own dogmas and rituals. Of course there are also those who were unfortunate and ended up burned to the stake or some other painful/horrible death.     This was then. Now, the Catholics are just busy keeping their flocks on line...Of course peacefully. The worse they can do to a "rebel" was to excomunnicate him, which is basically like saying "we will not talk to you forever until you agree with us!"...Like some sort of peer pressure.    You may not agree with the Catholics' way, but then what do you want to accomplish? You can look at Islam, and you will notice technically, it agrees with your rhetorics. But then, you will also find dozens of ways to criticize it. Why not? Look at Judaism. Absolutely 100% spot on with your preaching, but it also says they are the chosen people and you Gentile, is only on the waiting list.  Why not criticize that?     I believe you can yap all day, but its a waste of time trying to convert anybody into your religious denomination. Why not spend more time on real Godly work, like say, helping a street child go to school?|`|PdtpXFZ8aa	One man's religion is another man's cult.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	It was the Romans (pagan) who promulgated Christianity, Constantine to be exact. They too bow down on the statues of Jupiter the gods of the god, Mars the god of War, Neptune the god of the Sea, Venus the god of Beauty.    When christianity was introduced to save Rome from falling down many of the pagan practices were incorporated with the Catholic religion, like: Christmas is similar to their celebration of Saturnalia - the Sun God (December 25).    And, what does Easter Bunny has to do with the Resurrection, btw.?    Edit: No argument there, that Christianity came from Judaism, but do you see them having crosses. My contention is where does Roman Catholism and its practices came about. Not the Christianity per se.    But you are wrong when you said it came from the Jews, Judaism came from the Jews, although the man jesus was a Jew, it was the Jews who had him (christ) crucified.      Edit: My point is Religion requires faith, thats all there is. Its like having a faith that the wind exist, but you do not need representation to continously believe in the wind. Do you?      Edit: If its not called worshipping, then tell that to the people who have been in the "Feast of Black Nazarene!" just what in the heck do you call that, throwing of scarf and towels that supposedly could heal you of any sickness if it touches the images of the christ.|`|AA12235069	Study first before taking things literally..

So, MTmorph, don't be biased.     The new testament is made around 60 years or so after the death of Jesus Christ. The early Christians used oral traditions to hand down the accounts of the NT. As you can see Gospels are not the same accounts as those of the apostles themselves.    Logically speaking, every account changes everytime it is handed down from one generation to another.     I know I am a Catholic but I had external sources that told me not to believe these religious entities. So, I am in a conflict right now on what to really believe. Faith or Logic?    And For the Old testament, the source of information is oblivious. The Bible turned out to be the most controversial and anomalous book in the history of Christianity. The first 4 books are from Torah which was the holy scripture of Judaism. Islam and Christianity are branches of Judaism.    Do you really think that the Apocryphas should be ruled out just because it is not part of the bible? What is the source of CCC? Is it also from the bible?    You cannot simply judge by cultural differences and you MTmorph have the option to adapt to it or not. Questioning the culture is questioning their beliefs. We have our own opinions.    Orthodox, Catholics, Protestants, Adventists, etc. Are simply Christian denominations with major differences. Don't change our culture because you are not a citizen of the Philippines. Why should you care? Don't be biased. Tell me, what are you? Are you a Protestant?     Because what you are doing is questioning the papal authority in the Vatican. That makes you a protestant and yet you are using their sources against them. How clever are you?    Realistically speaking, religion is just an illusion of conjured trickery that bypasses the pathway to GOD.|`|4g9UKpyVaa	ahahahhahaha you know nothing.    we dont worship other gods. those statues ure talking about are statues of saints and jesus. and they are there for us to remember. oh and it's not for ourselves, it's for the honor of the saints for being great followers of God.     and it's OUR tradition what do u have against it?    why dont ya mind ur own business?
PSiNv7gUaa	I would call Disney's customer service hotline and ask.  I never rely on the websites for those kinds of questions regarding park tickets, and the Disney customer service reps are very friendly.  The only downside is some of them have foreign accents and are kind of hard to understand, but still very nice and give very thorough answers.  :)|`|eD7qRBKHaa	You are not allowed to use two days off of your ticket in a day.  That's the whole reason they don't allow it - because they realize that it would be cheaper than buying park hoppers.  So no, you cannot do that.  So you are correct - you will either need to add the park hopper option on to your ticket, or buy a separate, one-day ticket with the park hopper.|`|54tW840Oaa	Get the park hopper it allows you to go to 2 different parks on one day thats why they have it.  hope this helps!|`|nEgJAtK7aa	How did you book your package. Contact the person that booked this for you.The hopper pass for 1 day for adult is $125.00 and $113.00 for kids. I am sure that you are only allowed one base ticket per day. It is all on the same ticket. And you scan your ticket when you go to the park each day. You do not have a different ticket for each day. The one ticket has the amount of days programed in it and you scan it each day. You can upgrade your whole package for park hopper for $7 a day total $49 that would be less for you to upgrade and have the park hopper ticket.|`|2087dfd1162615f9b4c34246909e1a45aa	i would call disney directly~~~|`|rSq790ksaa	I'll have to check back and give you the proper info. and prices later but from memory I think it's a $50 option to add on the park hopper and therefore if it's only for one day it would just be cheaper for you to use another base ticket for that same day in MGM (it's now called Hollywood Studios by the way).|`|hLsUuO6qaa	As mentioned, you cannot use two single park tickets on one day.  Adding the park hopper option is nice to have if you can afford it for various reasons.    For all your ticket questions check out this thread http://disboards.com/showthread.php?t=14...

If you were a resident of Alberta and you passed the test, yes you can drive in other provinces.    In Alberta at 14, all you get is a learner's permit and you have to have someone who is over 18 and is not a probationary driver with you.

0exde9VEaa	According to Streets of George Town, Penang, a map of the early 1800s showed   that Armenian Street was formerly called Malay Lane, due to the Malay kampong   settlement there. The name was changed to Armenian Street, in tribute to the Armenian merchants   who played a key role in Penang's economy. The neighbourhood was assumed by the   Straits Chinese in the mid 1800s.|`|AA10139601	very sorry that i can't help u lah because i as a malaysian also don't know how does the name comes from may be is name derive from a hundred years ago|`|e0wqorLqaa	Maybe because an Armenian had a restaurant which serves food so good the CM of Penang decides to honour him.    You know Malaysia. Everything can! (Malaysia Boleh!)
48c6685184ad3b461d9a205eb3ef7ce0aa	Well there is no common address format convention in India you could rely on. This is because not all streets/roads have (unique) names, and house numbering is usually not systematic - if there are house numbers at all. The more rural it gets, the more descriptive the addresses.    You will find any format under the sun, the easiest being    Name    Street Name  Part of Town  City, ZIP    but usually things like    Name  "NameOfHouse"  near Landmark  ThisThat Colony  City, Zip  State, India    and other means to identify a house like    T/C No. xyz (Town Corporation house number)   XXRA No. xyz (Residents Association number)    or proximity to a landmark.    Sometimes you also find alternative post offices like  Street Description  ThisPartofTown P.O.  OtherPartofTown  City, ZIP  State, India    You will find that people may use different formats to describe the same place, e.g. your neighbors may give their address in a totally different way than you give yours, even if they live next door.    Bottom line - there are no rules, and if there are, nobody knows or follows them (a bit like traffic in India :). That is also why there is no navigation system or map web site in India which could really point you to a given address. Try this yourself - look up any address and try to locate it using Google Maps or mapmyindia.com: you NEVER get the right spot marked in the map. As there rarely are any street signs - good luck in finding a spot, you will usually have to ask locals to point you the way.    That is one o the reasons why the postal service is very unreliable, if you want to get something delivered go with a courier company like BlueDart and give them a phone number of the recpient so that they can call and track down the place.    Good luck :)|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Your hypothetical address is a bit wrongly written. Instead take the following address for easy conception :     Mr / Ms   ninja wave,  Researcher ( Yahoo Questions ),  25 / 31, XXX   Street,  Kodambakam,  CHENNAI - 675762,  Tamil Nadu State,  India.    I am sure the address is self explanatory. If any doubts ask freely. Thanx.
feapxnJPaa	Call 1-407-828-1000 and you set up an audition over the phone.  The auditions take place by the costuming building for the Animal Kingdom.  You go like you're going to the Lodge, but make a left instead of a right and it's on the left side I believe.    When you audition, they usually have you pick a back-up incase you don't make it.  That way, you'll still have a job.  I think if you're auditioning, you can only choose one back-up.  If you're just going for any job  like merchandizing or attractions, you can pick two.    Good luck!!|`|rSq790ksaa	You can call and set up an interview over the phone but when you're there you actually have to audition (depending on what type of job you want).
UQLNP6iyaa	Disney are currently running a 3 for 7 deal where you pay for 3 days park and hotel and you get 4 free. It's an extraordinary deal and one not likely to be repeated. Go to their website for more info.    Renting a Villa is a good idea if you are not going to spend the entire time in the parks, but you still want to be close by. I've attached a link to a company I've used once and to a specific house which belongs to someone I know.
Zf18VjlCaa	There are flat rate priority boxes. They are between $9 and $13 to ship regardless of weight (with in the US, international is a 20lb limit).    Just mailing an item priority is usually not cheaper than flat rate priority (all flat rate is priority shipping). Priority is actually extremely expensive if mailing things that way more than 1lb.     I shipped an item priority and it weighed like 30lbs and it cost over $100 to ship. It was Christmas presents though and it would have cost more to ship them in flat rate boxes. Flat rate is usually the cheaper way if you are only mailing a few things that are heavy. In the case of me shipping gifts at Christmas it works out cheaper to ship it all in one box and pay the overly expensive cost. Although I do still chip candles in flat rate boxes because if I put them in with a larger box it will take it way up. So It would be cheaper for me to send 3 boxes of candles flat rate for like $30 than to put them in the box with all the other gifts, cos to mail those priority it would cost me an extra $100.     I know this is confusing, but flat is usually the better way to ship.  You do have to add insurance and stuff for extra costs. The only rate of shipping that includes insurance and tracking is Express and it's only up to $100.

Gq0t3ERIaa	I love staying at Walt Disney World, of course.  Kissimmee is all right. I've stayed at the Radisson Orlando, not bad. They say kids under 10 or 12 eat free. Yah, but only in their really expensive restaurant. Kissimme does seem to be the cheapest area. There's a lot of traffic there. They do have some reasonable places to eat.  I've stayed at the Holiday Inn on International Drive in Orlando. It's very busy and noisy late into the night and early morning, especially down where we were. Up closer to Sea World seemed a little nicer, but still busy. There is a lot of things to do on International Drive.  Lake Buena Vista is the closest to Walt Disney World, since WDW is in Lake Buena Vista. It's just a little Southeast of Orlando.   We stayed at the Comfort Inn there. It was all right. That was back in 2003 so I don't know what they're like now. I'd say their a 2 star hotel. They did have security there that you had to pass before you could go to the hotel. Kids eat free there and their food was cheap back then.  I wouldn't pay anymore than $40 a night though.  If you like security, you can't beat Disney. Every resort has security that you must pass to get to the hotel.  Value resorts can run between $89-$129ish, depending on what season you go.  www.mousesavers.com has information on the different seasons and any discounts that are availible.|`|54tW840Oaa	ok well here is my vacation plan for you:  rent a car  rent a house they are so nice and most of them screened in pools my family uses inn house vacation rentals (www.innhouse.com)  buy any park tickets at Wal-Mart 4444 W.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	For a number of reasons, we get a bunch of questions asking what its really like in Los Angeles.    First of all, I'll tell you what it's NOT like: It's not like anything on TV. People watch shows on TV and think thats what its like out here. The Real OC, Newport Beach, The Hills, etc. Ever wonder why people in those shows never have to pay bills, do laundry, and are NEVER stuck in traffic? Because its FAKE. And the news doesnt help either, since they know that sex and sensationalism sells. News flash: There arent running gun battles in the street. There arent shootouts every day. Also, you dont see celebrities just walking down the street, all glammed up, or sipping a cappuccino at Starbucks waiting to sign autographs. We don't go surfing during lunch hour.     Some sections are REALLY nice, others are ghetto. Too many people have this vision in their head that LA is one or the other (either Beverly Hills or Compton). In fact, most of it is working class and middle class stiffs working to pay the bills.    You NEED a car to live in Southern California. We dont have an effective public transportation like New York or San Francisco. One reason is that LA is larger in area than either of those, without a central hub where everything is. Back in the 1960s, we might have done it. But by the time local governments got their act together, it was much more difficult to make a working public transit system. Also, unlike NY, we have earthquakes, which make it a little more difficult to build underground.     The freeway traffic is probably the worst thing about living here. The 405 is the worst. Know why they call it the 405? Because you go 4 o' 5 miles per hour, and it takes 4 o' 5 hours to get where you're going. Freeway Traffic is bad from 6-10 AM and bad from 3-7 PM. I don't know why they call it rush hour. It's more than an hour, and nobody's rushing, that's for sure.    The gangs are the cause of many rumors. Keep in mind that there are gangs in any large town, in every part of the country. In LA, the gangs aren't really downtown, they are in South LA, East LA, and north Long Beach (an extension of the South LA gangs, actually). And here's the deal: Mostly, they just kill each other.    Gas is expensive in California. Its about 20-30 cents above the national average.     Yes, gas and real estate are very expensive in SoCal. However, this would be the best time to BUY a house because it's a buyer's market right now. There are a lot of foreclosures, and too many houses on the market.     Yep, freeways are a drag, it's smoggy in summer, and expensive to live here. Yet, if it's so bad, why do we have thousands and thousands of people moving here?     Weather, Activities, Plenty of jobs, Beaches, mountains, deserts all within driving distance, and plenty of opportunity for those who have the skills and tenacity.    In colder parts of the country, people keep their cars in their garages all winter. Kids get snow toys for Christmas. Here, kids get BIKES, scooters, and skateboards. 10 AM Christmas morning, the streets are FULL of kids on their new bikes, scooters, etc.     The job market is good here, mainly because there are SO many people here that it creates its own job market. Then there are MANY industries, including tourism, entertainment, shipping, manufacturing, etc. Its an incredible economy.    However, it is not for everyone. Every time someone posts this question, you get the LA haters who post their bile and venom. A lot of them dont know what they are talking about. Some people never even visit, and hate it on principle and stereotypes. Some actually visited once, and found out it wasnt like it was on TV, and it certainly wasnt Mayberry. And some actually lived here, and couldnt deal with the expense, the traffic, or the somewhat impersonal nature of living in a large metropolis. To those I would say good luck to you wherever you are, but please dont spew your hatred in this forum.     As for lifestyle, its rather casual. You work during the week, and then go do something fun on the weekend, so that you can impress your coworkers around the water cooler on Monday.     To summarize, LA a HUGE metropolis that really defies easy description. I live in one of the nicer suburbs, but the commute is no fun, often 1-2 hours each way each day. However, 340+ days of sunshine really helps. Yeah, it's expensive. Mrs. Obviousman and I both have to work to pay the mortgage. But is it worth it? You bet!|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	The air pollutions levels here are usually from Good to Moderate. The weather is fine. The people are fake. Shopping is just like anywhere else.    Maybe one or two in the course of 10 years. Yes, it's hard.    Depends on which high school you go to. Again. Depends on which high school you go to.    As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.    You will also need about $10,000 to start off.    Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.    Bottom Line: Look elsewhere, in 3 months you will probably be back in Tennessee with no improvement whatsoever.|`|5vjw88zzaa	Hi. I've lived in Los Angeles area for 63 years.  You might see some celebrities, but don't count on it.  If you do want to find them you would have to go to where Santa Monica Blvd. meets Wilshire Blvd. for one area, but that is just one area.  The high school quality depends upon the city in which you live.  Some are excellent and many are terrible.  Cliques are a fact of life through the 6 decades I've been here.  The weather is great as is the shopping.  Public transportation is bad but improving slowly.  I think people here are nice, but you can live in one area and never meet your neighbors because they are working more than one job just to afford the housing costs.  This cost is slightly balanced by the very low utility cost.  Shopping is everywhere.  The beach cities are, IMHO, the best place to live but also the most expensive.

Phi Phi's must do is "The Beach" boat trip, also try and stay on the main bit (some parts only accessible by boat or a very long walk) so you can wander about at night. I think you can do elephant rides somewhere on Phuket,  quintessentially Thai experience! Also head up to Phanga Bay, google it, stunning!!!<br>  <br>  Have fun, it's an amazing place|`|YMnTveWuaa	Phuket|`|UR1BsvQmaa	There are plenty of activities, Phuket is very developed with shopping and also nightlife if you want.

I don't know where you grab the public transportation, but it's not at the airport.

Yummo!!|`|wVzm8Ir7aa	Yes, Kona Cafe is still located on the second floor of the Great Ceremonial House next to 'Ohana and yes, it still has Tonga Toast. It's also available at Captain Cook's at the Polynesian Resort and both Rainforest Cafe and Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside have their own versions of stuffed french toast.|`|6GX2SHo3aa	check online sites about the menus because they are there. the last time i was there it was there still but it was NEVER open every time i went there. i also went in the evening most times i went and it wasn't ever open! it might be open in the mornings but i don't know for sure. if you are going call the polynesian and check cause that will be a 100% correct answer. hope that helped!|`|21e0e69dece252916371aa3772468af9aa	Yeaaah!

bLahP9Ivaa	The Guantanamo Naval base is over a century old. The area where the base is located was leased from Cuba, and the Cubans now claim that the lease is invalid but the US contest this. The Cubans do not like the base and certainly not the prison camp, but as the US is a superpower and Cuba is an island nation there is not much they can do about it.|`|8kIE1Dswaa	The US government took the right to have the naval base when they controlled the country after the Spanish left.    The base is separated from the rest of Cuba by barbed wire and minefields.    About the only thing the Cuban government could have done was invade - which would have been seen as an act of war.|`|64IEjXOBaa	It is US Government property, so Cuba couldn't do anything about it!|`|ABdZDjjcaa	Very easy. Our government was very busy torturing us, the Cuban people, to do anything like that. Besides, they don't care what the USA government does    What they have done is protest against it, a common attitude from the thief that screams: "Catch the robber" to take the attention of the people away from what he is stealing     Besides, the Cuban government tortures very quietly, and for some reason, even after the prisoners are released, nobody pays attention to what they say|`|L1HVLylMaa	And why do you think that fidel would care a fig about that ?

JMVkZJzUaa	According to the Unnoficial Guide to Walt Disney World (available at your local book retailer), Fulton's Crab House's dress code is "Casual," which is pretty much resort wear - t-shirts and shorts are totally acceptable.  Keep in mind this is an upscale restaurant, so you might feel a little underdressed in tank-tops and flip flops, but you'll still be served here.    Some Disney World restaurants adopted a business casual dress coda a few years back. This means twill or khaki pants for men, with a shirt that has a collar, and nothing sleeveless for women.  Theses restaurants are:  Artist Point at the Wilderness Lodge, Yachtsman Steakhouse at the Yacht Club resort,  California Grill at the Contemporary Resort, Jiko's at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, Citricos at the Grand Floridian Resort, Flying Fish at Disneys Boardwalk, Shulas Steakhouse at the Dolphin resort, and at Victoria and Alberts at the Grand Floridian the dress code is: jacket required for men, proper evening attire for women.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i can't provide a link but i would chose to dress up a little no jeans some nice slacks and a blouse/ top or a nice skirt with a top. It really depends on the time of year and the time you want to dine. After 6:30 or so i would dress a little more.|`|6GX2SHo3aa	everything in disney world is casual except victoria's and alberts and maybe the concord steakhouse/california grill. from what ive expirienced it is very casual so plan on doing that. it is right near the rainforest cafe and there is so much noise and lights, etc from there and its right in downtown disney that it cant really be too formal. hope that helped!

XZs320Whaa	Likes:     The PEOPLE, most definitely. Everyone's so nice and friendly; even strangers will say hi. Compared to other big cities, Austin is very inexpensive. Houses here can be very cheap, unless you're planning on living downtown, where it's a tad bit more expensive. Going downtown is always a lot of fun. There are art murals everywhere, and most likely live music somewhere. The overall vibe of Austin is very laid back. AWESOME place to live :D    Dislikes:  Sometimes in summer the weather can be a little too hot. It's sometimes a bother.. :/ But other than that.. nothing!|`|O71xlcG3aa	Likes:  the people are the best, there is always something to do, plenty of places to exercise and take your pets, great location, the 130 toll road, 6th street, the weather like 95% of the time, festivals, art exhibits, diversity, great shopping, all of downtown, good food and great live music!    Dislikes:  the roads, the people who TRY to drive on the roads, the 5% of the time when it is too hot and humid to go outside!|`|HfWFdfnBaa	I love Austin.  Im a student and Austin is very laid back city.   While people are kinda strange its really friendly not the best drivers but really friendly people.   Austin is full of stuff to do, always live music, UT!! games are always the best, lots of parades and festivals. Austin is one of the healthiest and safest places in america, and it gives off a young and old type vibe and the hill country is just beautiful. In the spring and summer Lake Travis is filled with people and its easy to go out and just stay out on the lake all day and into the late of night. 183, I-35, and Mopac have some intense traffic but thats like the only bad thing i've found
Fz6mWntvaa	Hey, I am an Australian living in southern victoria, about an hour and a half from Melbourne. I have never lived/visited America but my good friend is American so i know a lot of the differences. I have been all around Australia and i have also been to a couple of Asian and European countries and lived in Germany for a bit. I hope my info gives you some insight into the aussie way...    Pros:  Melbourne is the sporting capital of Australia and us aussies are sporty people. Our major sport is footy (AFL- australian football) which is played from march til september - all footy players are legends here! cricket is also big as well as rugby (rugby is not popular in melbourne though).   The beaches here are the BEST! most people tend to live near the beach and anything to do with sun and sand is what we do best.      Cons:  Public Transport totally sucks ... can't say much more...    and i can't diss australia too much so i can't think of much else at the moment...      WEATHER:  well you would be interested to hear that last week, victoria had 4 consecutive days above 40 degrees celcius..! (104f) we were soooo hot.. good thing for the beach!   our weather can change dramatically quickly like today it was cold and thunder-y...  in summer it generally gets to the mid 30s here in melbourne  in winter there is vertually no snow where people live... we drive to the snow fields that are about 3 and a half hours north.. here it goes to minus 5 C... but in the city it is normally about 10 or 15..    hope that helps!|`|hT7BhNamaa	Blazinbi, I'm Canadian up here in Montreal, so don't tell me about cold and snow. I have been to Aussie a number of times and stayed with my for six months also. When you go to Australia then you will understand why I praise the place. The people are warm, friendly and welcoming, you get the feeling the Aussies would virtually take the shirts off their backs for you. The sun, the surf, food is unbelievable.    Just go!!!    Chris|`|bn0oXqDcaa	It gets really humid and stuffy, its a quiet place to live if you want to relax.  The people are friendly and u can have a chat on the train, tram, bus with random people. You won't get bored of seeing the blonde and blue eyes type because we're vastly multicultural.    AussieLand is Great (:|`|CflxLtV8aa	Hey! I've lived in Aus all my life. It's very easy going. I live in Brisbane. Queensland is great! It's not to hot. Max probably 35 in summer. Winter is really cold!!! Well...for us. It drops to like 10. The suns really hot. You can get a good tan. I don't think I'll live here forever tho. I'm thinking about moving to the US!!! I love you guyz! But if you were going to move to Australia I'd defsa recommend Brisbane! I mean Sydney and Melbourne and Canberra are beautiful places but very crowded. To get a real Aussie experience you gotta go to some rural areas. Btw don't go to Darwin!!!! Its so hot! Well some people like it. It's a beautiful place!    All the best!!|`|mccsDQGvaa	australia is the best place you should definetly come out for a holiday    it has everything you could want and more, ive been to america befroe and there is certaintly some similarities but more diffrences as far as im concerned|`|URuzNGcyaa	It's nice here, it's similar to the USA in a lot of ways
a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Sorry it's top secret.. but we have them in our bedrooms also.. shhhh!|`|lMJBaacxaa	well, my mother and I use them to put ice in our cooler when we go out and need it. lol that's very nifty if you don't want to keep freezing and waiting yourself for ice. They have bowls that you put on the table so when you have guests over you won't have to get up every minute to refill your glass with ice. And plus, I don't think I even have seen anything you can make perfect ice cubes in the rooms and I stay in a condo or whatever. Anyways, I think they are quite nifty.|`|md5gjv3qaa	some people like to shove ice cubes up their butt thats why they go to hotel rooms so they can do it in private|`|O9NIYqkLaa	i don't kno.. never made sense to me.. i sometimes get the bucket of ice to chew on..|`|OUcQjqI0aa	most motels don't have mini bars.    we like to use them during sex.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Haha, that would be cool if they did.  Well I've lived in California my whole life, but I've been to every state. So I've done a lot of hotel-ing. And no, not every one had an ice machine, so the TV is wrong. We mostly used it for our cooler so anything we traveled with wouldn't go bad immediately. It was also nice to have cold water/lemonade if it was hot. But the thing we used it most for was just chewing on it. We had fat cups and we just scooped the ice up and chewed on it in the car and by the time we got to the next hotel, it was time to refill the ice chest!

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Tracy to Fremont is a tough commute. I have a coworker who commutes from Tracy to South Hayward (not very far from Fremont). She has to be out the door by 5:30 in order to get to work at 7; if she leaves later, the traffic gets worse.    Tracy is "backwards" compared to other places in the Bay Area. It is in the Central Valley, which means it gets very hot in the summer and colder in the winter. It's more rural than the Bay Area. I don't know about Tracy specifically, but rural cities in California tend to have cows, rodeo, conservative views, and possibly tension between whites and Mexicans.    I live in Fremont and it is a pretty good place to live. Despite what the person above me thinks, it isn't an "Asian town." It is an extremely diverse town and there are people of all ethnicities here. Mission San Jose High School is one of the best in California, but houses in that area can be well over a million dollars. Houses in other parts of Fremont are more reasonably priced.|`|eLoWmMh2aa	Tracy is  more typical American city like, new houses, nice park, it take a couple of hour to commute( most traffic jam around 580 Pleasanton to Livermore), you can take commuter train ACE or Carpool, You can get bargain for those foreclosure real estates( less than $200K).    Fremont is an Asian city and pretty expensive( average house $500K), most residents there are Indian, Chinese... the school( Mission San Jose area) are very good and competitive, because those Asian Kids can spend 10 to 16 hrs per day for study.    I suggest you rent apartment in Fremont or Pleasanton first and do your research, and choose best area for your house, school.
rVUvopaLaa	i'm from sydney also a commonwealth like canada with similar employment opportunties and hiring system.    like you i'm also from UST and i know some CAFA grads in sydney who ended up getting well paid jobs.      there's one realtiy in migration you need to face.    first, the position you left in the phils does not necessarily the same as what you have overseas    in other words you need to start somewhere and work through your way to the top later. this is the problem of most migrants they feel "degraded" if they begin in a position way below of what they where in the Phils.      meaning when we migrate we leave behind some of your pride otherwise it'll pull you down.  trust me. particularly at this time of economic crisis you really need to check your priorities.    for you to be recognised to a commonwealth government of your qualifications you need to take an exam that accredits your qualifications    you need to enrol to a course if necessary relevant to your BSarch that will fortify your qualifications although UST as a university you need CURRENT qualifications to support your BSarch course particulalrly if you graduated more than 5 years.  now if are a fresh graduate you need years of experience to support your qualifications.    good luck|`|ApYYZoxoaa	UST|`|CuYQ57mjaa	If you can finish architecture in University of Toronto, you have absolutely endless opportunity in finding the right job for you in Greater Toronto Area.  An architecture graduate from UST, as you specified,  need to pass the licensure exam here and take the necessary requirements to be accredited under professionals in Canada, otherwise, you'll be a drafter for the mean time.      I think you'll get more good answers if you'll post this under travel>canada category.|`|AA12235069	Yes.. You will be look at as having a lesser credential if compared to someone who graduated in the area if based on education alone.. It still depends on the experiences though... It also depends on the company..    Honestly, if I am an employer, I will hire someone with credential originating from GTA rather than Philippines if just basing from education.. If experience is a factor, then it's something else..    But if you want to study in the Philippines, I advise you to proceed and enjoy.. You will eventually find a great job.. Philippine education is great and should not be a basis for future employment.. What matters is that it is accredited or can be accredited with additional classes or licensure exams taken later on..... I know what you feel. Go for it as long as you have the finances...
CuYQ57mjaa	If you don't want to pay and get some hustles, declare the item as personal and tell them you've used it.

I had the rear window of my rental car broken out "as a message" - but the digital camera in plane site in the front seat area (I forgot it was there) was NOT stolen.<br>  <br>  Many people dive from the water fall area - also has a swing rope there.

4lm0oj2caa	Well, if the Polish independence day means nothing to you why do you choose this day to wave the American flag at Polish people celebrating their national holiday? <br>  I don't really think they're against the American flag or Americans as such. It just seems that you deliberately try to provoke them so they get angry. They're American but they also want to remember about their Polish heritage and that's why they celebrate that day. I'm sure it's not only the Polish minority who does it.<br>  And the question you asked about going to Poland and launching fireworks on the fourth of July, I'm sure nobody would mind. And no one would wave the Polish flag at you. It seems a bit nationalist and xenophobic to wave your national flag at other nation celebrating their holiday.<br>  Now I have a question to you. I guess it reflects what you do more than the example you gave:<br>  How would YOU feel if you lived in Poland and on the American independence day, just as you celebrate your national holiday, some Polish people started waving the Polish flag at YOU? <br>  This is exactly what you do to Poles in Chicago.<br>  Don't use your flag as a tool to upset others.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I was born in Poland and raised in the state of Connecticut...the Constitution State...and as you know the Constitution guarantees you that first amendment right to wave whatever flag you want.  Chicago also has a big Irish population, and on March 17th, there will be some that will only wave the Irish flag and not the American one...so again, the American Constitution protects them for doing so.  Isn't the American Constitution wonderful?!|`|dpKntiZoaa	I'm not Polish and I'm not American, but it seems to me like it's a story of two halves!<br>  <br>  If you are waving the American flag at them deliberately then of course they are going to get rattled by it and vice versa.<br>  <br>  I have seen more than my fair share of American's playing the fool abroad and generally just raised an eyebrow and moved on.<br>  <br>  I think you are just going to have to 'live and let live' - there are more important things to get upset about honestly.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Since Otis college is right by the airport, you'll be on the west side of LA. Venice and Santa Monica beaches are nearby, but there are many other things to see in LA:    There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination.   Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination.  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.    Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.    Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.      Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles
DESsW5xqaa	I recommend the Hong Kong Museum of History in Tsimshatsui and the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in Shatin. They have really cool reconstructions of old buildings that you can actually walk through. The HKMH has much more than HKHM, so go for that if you can only do one.<br>  <br>  You'll probably want to see the Legislature Building in Central. You can make a day of it by also going to the nearby mid-levels escalator where you can see the old Victoria Jail (sadly it's not open for visiting, though), the Sun Yat Sen museum, and the old Street Market is a must-see. Just walking through the streets there you'll see a lot of old tenement buildings.<br>  <br>  Wanchai is another area you could check out for the "haunted house" at the end of Ship Street, the old post office, and the Blue House. The Pawn is pretty cool looking, too, even though they changed a lot of the original structure and it's now an upscale restaurant.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it would be hours of fun to ride the tram all the way. You'll see a lot of old (and new) areas this way, too.<br>  <br>  The Kowloon Walled City park is a good place to go for old Chinese architecture, but it's kind of out of the way by itself, so you might not want to take the time to do that one.<br>  <br>  Speaking of out of the way, if you had more time I'd recommend the Ping Shan trail in Yuen Long, too. That's mostly a whole lot of old temples and other things built for Feng Shui purposes.<br>  <br>  Check out the links below for more details.|`|YBbumuyFaa	Look here<br>  <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">http://wikitravel.org/en/Hong_Kong</a><br>  <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Macau" rel="nofollow">http://wikitravel.org/en/Macau</a>
AI2SRjLaaa	Some time after the queen passes away. (because she is a lovely woman and we wouldn't want to hurt her feelings)    If we do, there will need to be a referendum again to see if the majority of people want to be a republic, if it is over 50% then that is what will happen. In 1999 we had a referendum and the republic failed.|`|a9efAneVaa	I certainly hope not, but probably will after the Queen dies.  We would end up with a Socialist Republic if the Labor Party has it's way!|`|SjNFANswaa	Hopefully not, I hate it when do gooders try to change everything.|`|CLjiev9Xaa	It will happen one day.   I will vote for it as soon as Charlie and that wife of his starts to rule, she will never be my queen.

As has already been stated, probably soon after Queen Elizabeth II dies.|`|dUpVqoB6aa	I think that it will eventually become a republic.But there are still a lot of monarchist people out there who tend to support the Queen and the royal family.I guess sooner or later more people will realise that we are very capable of being on our own and that the Queen is not interested in Australia anyway.|`|AA11441385	Yes.  Probably soon after the current Queen dies.|`|IIuafPfIaa	Soon, maybe.    They might also change our flag when it's a republic.|`|pnZssBg9aa	Yes. Probably when good ol' Prince Charlie declines to become King and Prince Bill declines to be King as well. This may happen once the Queen is gone.
UzPFTdUFaa	Egham is a suburban town close to London which is just over 20 miles away.It has shops,restaurants and a frequent train service to London Waterloo. There is much green space in the area including the massive<br>  Windsor Great Park,  and the lake at Virginia Water. The race course at Ascot famous for its stylish horse racing including the 'Royal Ascot'<br>  event, attended by the Queen, is nearby too

They always get connecting rooms and the guys get one and the girls get another. Just make sure that you get two queen beds and if needed for a small charge they will bring up a roll away bed or perhaps a couple of the kids might even be willing to bring a sleeping bag. Every hotel will accomodate you this  request for connecting rooms. I'd make sure that you book a hotel with free breakfast and an indoor pool. The Drury's have always done well for our family with free happy hour (kids get soda and snacks) and a free full breakfast.
FK9Z75Staa	Wow, you're starting your research on yahoo Answers?! You would make a terrible businessman. If you do decide to do this, however, you need to draft a business plan (a good one, just like you need to do in all other countries), you need to give "personal taxes to certain authorities" (aka bribes) sometimes to some criminal organizations and you need to go through all of the Russian red tape (again, involving bribes.) <br>  <br>  Unless you worked at a Russian company in a rather high administrative position, starting a business in Russia is completely stupid.

Works well if you have a simple flight plan.|`|wXx8RcOvaa	I think Haugism or whatever his name was said it best.  Expedia is a real good site if you don't want to really search to hard and do much work.  They are usually right up at the top as far as price and knowledge of hotels, resorts and airlines throughout the world.  I used them from time to time but not as much anymore.  I always go to their site to find out about resorts and hotels but have found booking flights seperate from the hotel on occasions to be cheaper.  Go directly to the airline for flight info and then go to a site like Hotels.com and right to the hotels web site and check for prices.  If you want to do just a little bit of work you can usually knock of a good $100 - $150.00  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	expedia maybe|`|kRTSVuywaa	ok definitely travelocity or orbitz or expedia...<br>  you could do all inclusive through them if you want to but i would suggest just doing hotel and flight because when u do all inclusive it limits you to certain places you can eat and drink. If you are going on vacation you want to explore and try new things.<br>  <br>  By booking flight and hotel together you always save more than booking seperately! <br>  <br>  These sights also give you options to book activities if you want and also car rentals if need be.<br>  <br>  I have used expedia so many times.

fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	There are lots of best - Kirkwood, Webster, Oakville, Ballwin, Chesterfield, Clayton, Ladue, Town and Country, Des Peres just to name a few. Most of these areas have low crime rates but the housing is rather expensive.<br>  Some of the lower income areas are Lemay and Valley Park to the south and many of the northern suburbs such as Ferguson, Berkley, Cool Valley, Bellfountaine Neighbors, Jennings as an example, This is not to say that there arent nice parts in these areas but some of these have higher crime rates.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	The further away you get from the city, the better the neighborhoods.  Depends on what you're looking for.  West county has more money there, North county is reasonable but has more traffic issues, South county is a mix as it was a more country area that has had much growth in the last several years.  The closer you get to the city the older the neighborhoods.  There is lots of rehabbing going on in the city itself too.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Based on personal perception<br>  <br>  Ladue - most expensive<br>  Town and Country<br>  Frontenac<br>  Chesterfield <br>  Creve Coeur<br>  Clayton<br>  Wildwood<br>  <br>  Avoid anything near the airport with the possible exception of parts of Bridgeton. Other than these there aren't many bad ones.<br>  <br>  If you want to find out how a specific zip code ranks the St. Louis Business Journal publishes a book of lists thank ranks by median salary or income per capita (I don't remember which)|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Take a 5+ hour tour of the city (and county) by cab.  Call the Dispatcher of County Cab.   Tell (him/her) a former driver (Tom) said to call.  Repeat your question, and ask for a driver who know's  St. Louis (City/County) like the back of his hand..  Things to be concerned about:   Food stores, schools (if applicable), parking your car, rush-hour -traffic (both ways) and naturally high/low crime area's.  Tell the Dispatcher you would like to give the driver say $100 and run without the meter. <br>  <br>  I know it seems like I'm going too far with this... but... I've lived in an around St. Louis city/county for 25+ years.  You don't want to get trapped in some area with barking dog's, dope dealers, and crime zones.  <br>  <br>  There are many locations in (and around St. Louis) that are a 30/40 minute drive from downtown that are safe spot for you and yours.  I'm now living in Murphysboro, Illinois (about 90+) miles from St. Louis. Every now and then we go back to St. Louis to see our friends who have become almost like family.  <br>  <br>  P.S.

l6yHfjBNaa	Hello.. Well I live about 2.5 hours from St. Louis, and have stayed there many times.     Well, if money really isn't a variable, then stay at the Millenium Hotel. It's right down town next to the Arch. Contrarily, if your looking for a little discounted stay, then go to price line and use the "negotiator" to get a really nice hotel at cheap prices.     Of course, one thing to see is the arch.. I've never been inside it, but that is something you can do. Also, Union Station would be a good place to go.. It used to be a mall, but now its just kinda a shop center and it has some restaurants. If you're looking for a museum, then you could go to the St. Louis Science Center. Shopping is good there. My favorite mall is the West County Center. Also, there's an outlet mall way out of town called St. Louis mills. It's really not that great for shopping.. and I guess it's not really an ideal anniversary place, but if you were to take kids it would be a great idea, because it has go carts, lazor tag, an arcade, glow-in-the-dark put-put golf, etc. If you like theme parks then you can go to Six Flags. Other good malls are, The Galaria, Chesterfield Mall, and Plaza Frontenac, which is more high-end with Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth avenue, but as I said earlier, West County Center is my favorite. It has Nordstrom's, Macy's, JCPenny's, and Dick's Sporting goods as its department stores.    Hope I've helped!

38MPmsaKaa	Bali has two famous beaches, Kuta and Sanur. One has white sand,  the other one black sand with a lot of sealife that you can watch just  by walkin in the water. Tanah Lot is a budhist temple on the seaside.  There is a cave underneath with a huge holy snake.  There are guided tours through the island to many beautiful places like  waterfalls, ancient palaces, rice field terraces on steep mountains.  Many shops to buy lovely things (hard negotiation is a must, tourist  pay often very high "tourist prices". Dont buy things around hotel / beach area.|`|WRhHwrsxaa	I think every places in Bali are interesting, I mean the whole Island, every corner of it, very exotic.|`|6a7da18edf1d149948e4892bf5a1dfceaa	for me is Kuta Square.The places is a bustling places with vendor and shops ,a nice place to walk around , friendly people and nice food too.

upwwspFIaa	I researched this a few years ago and found that being next to the emergency exit is the best spot. Whether in the back middle(over wing) or back of the plane. But really I found that in an actual crash, because of the unpredictable nature of a crash, that there is no Safe seat.  Quick story. Plane makes an emergency landing but crashes due to a short runway.A guy was sitting next to the emergency exit over the wing and had his head completly cut off and the guy next to him was fine.. Guess it was just his time. You just have to sit in your assigned seat and have a little faith.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Probably over the wing (worst) and to the rear of the plane (safest)

bR5Dzulsaa	OK, every country has different foods, traditions and festivals!!    England:    Food:  Roast Dinner  Hotpot  Jellied eels  Meat pies  Pasties  Fish and Chips    Traditions:  Morris Dancing (a horrible sight!)  St George's day (not widely celebrated)    Festivals:  Many small festivals, but not any big ones.  Music festivals are a sort of modern tradition. Things like Glastonbury.      Scotland:    Food:  Haggis  Battered Mars bars (a modern tradition)    Traditions:  Burns Night  St Andrew's day  Highland dancing  Highland games    Festivals:  The Edinburgh festival  The highland games (lots of little festivals)      Wales (the best country):    Food:  ******* (liver, wixed with breadcrumbs. It's sick!)  Bara Lawr (seaweed)  Cawl (a vegetable and meat broth with leeks, and heaven on a winter night)  Welshcakes  Bara brith (a delicious fruit loaf)    Traditions:  We have our own 2000 year old language!  Playing sexy rugby  Plygain (killing little birds after Chapel on Christmas day)  Folk Dancing  Clocsio (a great type of folk dancing)  Choir singing  Talwrn y beirdd (competitions of Welsh poetry writing off the top of their heads. Very funny!)  Eisteddfod (singing and poetry competitions that date back about 1000 years.    Festivals:  Eisteddfod Genedlaethol (Eisteddfod is a competition of Welsh language poetry writing, book writing, dancing and singing. It goes back hundreds of years to before England was invaded by the Normans).  Eisteddfod yr Urdd (Europe's largest Youth festival. Like the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol, but for young people, 6-25 year olds)  The Royal Welsh (a Welsh farming festival)  Llangollen (An International Eisteddfod which invites cultures from all accross the world to come to Llangollen and show what they've got. Competitions to find out which country has the best dances, best songs etc).      N.Ireland:    Foods, Traditions, festivals are all divided accross sectarian borders.

UzPFTdUFaa	I get your point uounosyg, but actually there is quite a lot of ancient forest left in England such as the Savernake Forest in Wiltshire, the New Forest National Park in Hampshire, the many wooded parts of the Surrey Hills and West Sussex etc. Also there is a new national forest being planted in the midlands, and many individual ancient woodlands throughout the country have been bought and preserved by the Woodland Trust. www.woodlandtrust.org.uk|`|1NPVVxW0aa	They have built many ugly houses, many of which are empty but worth a lot of money.    They've modified the environment by graffiti, fire and broken glass in urban environments and claimed ownership of every square inch of the country that can be made money from.    Humans have not had to physically adapt much to a mildly temperate country like the UK, though humans haven't had to adapt physically to any environment other than skin colour.|`|fKpBXXJbaa	I wouldn't say they have adapted to it, rather they've adapted the environment to suit them - 4,000 years ago practically the whole island was covered in the original forest, and now apart from a few remnants in Scotland there's nothing left of it. The coniferous forests planted in the last 90 years don't count, except they're another sign of humans changing their environment.
AA11536773	Honestly? Not so much. You can take in some of the sights - like the Eiffel Tower at Paris, the Fountains at Bellagio, Sigfried & Roy's Secret Garden at Mirage... Some of the rides - like the roller coasters at NYNY and the Stratosphere... You can shop - at Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Venetian, and Caesar's Palace.

Ive done the haunted vegas tour and if your into that sort of thing its cool i had a great time with it.  otherwise   maybe you can talk your group into renting a car and going to the hoover dam and red rock canyon those are must see's.    and  the neon boneyard museum tour is really cool but you need to make reservations by email before you go.|`|3c8989e5bc5f8ea70202688edc6f7c1daa	there are strip joints for those over 18    there is some shows to see    in henderson they are opening a nite club for those under 18..     there are many shopping centers that young people hang out.. the town square on the strip by i215 is awesome and really cool people hang out... there are numerous parks, movies and again lots of shopping centers    if you like roller coasters, many of them now, there is also a video hang out on the strip...    lake mead, lots of hunks out there|`|FPiKno2Kaa	the first time i went i was nine, and i can honestly say it was one of the best holidays i have ever been on, and i go to alot of places. the last time i went i was 13 and i had just as much fun. there are theme parks, great shops and much more. all the hotels are themed and inside of them they have some great attractions.  las vegas is one of the only places i have been where you are never short of something to do, and to be honest it isnt all about gambling like most people think, thats only a very small part.  i am sure you will have a really great time, enjoy your spring break.

One of the many things that impressed me about these wonderful people was that at least 90% of them speak fluent English.  As for Tagalog, yes it is the national language but there are at least 17 distinctly different dialects spoken in that country, depending where you are in the Philippines.  For instance, in Manila, the largest city, Tagalog is the predominant dialect that is spoken.  But go down to Cebu, the 2nd largest city and the people there routinely speak Cebuano.  In Bacolod City, a large city on Negros-Occidental the Ilongo dialect is used.    But forget about all those dialects.  Just say Will you marry me in English.  I'll bet she will understand you.  Good luck.|`|AA12235069	TRhe English version is the most common phrase but if you really want Tagalog then please see below.      "Gusto kitang makasama ng habang buhay.. Mahal kita.. Pakasalan mo sana ako.."    means---  I want to be with you for my entire life. I love you. I wish that you marry me.

This might be a reason why we have 2 official language too, it's because there are some phrase, words that is really not convenient to use in Tagalog.    but if you really want to use Tagalog you can say  "Tatanggapin mo ba ang alay kong pakasalan kita?"  or "Magpakasal na tayo"    either ways. goodluck on your proposal!  best wishes:D|`|9e0d992f952d869210eb573adbcae793aa	It's a very interesting question because we don't say that question in Tagalog at all?  Most guys will say that in English, although at the local provinces, they would use their own dialects for that.  Verbatim, it's translated as "Papayag ka bang maging asawa ko? or Papakasal ka ba sa akin?".  But again, it's a little bit awkward to say that this era.  If you really want to speak in Tagalog when you pop the big question, you can say "Mahal and mahal kita!  Will you marry me?".  Which means, "I love you very much.  Will you marry me?"    and Goodluck to you!
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Nope.  You don't have to be a WDW cast member first though they are always told when the auditions are and it's much easier to know if you are.  Though some people have been grabbed off the streets and asked and some modeling agencies have been contacted in the past to look for "Cinderella".    2) They set an open casting more than an interview.  They tell you if you meet the requirements or not and give you a How To speech at the time.  Basically a Here are the Expectations and the Criteria.  Then you are told if you have a chance at being it (based on your own measurements).    3) You do not have to be fur to be face.  Most are not.  Face characters have exacting standards but since you have to look so much like the character and meet the physical body shape, if you do--you aren't forced to be a fur first.  It really doesn't help you out since you aren't practicing your faces while in the fur.  One of my good friends at Disney, her roommate was Tinkerbell.  She went straight to the audition, was weighed and immediately began training for Tinkerbell and her flight across Tomorrowland.    4) It's one giant room with one giant casting process.  They ask if you are interested (after given the criteria) in face or fur.  If you pick Face, they separate you and basically evaluate you.  If you are told you don't make the grade, you can go back to the Fur part.  It's not 2 separate auditions.  Just two separate list of criteria, face being sooo much harder.|`|feapxnJPaa	As far as I know, you don't have to be a current cast member to be a face character, but it really really helps.  Other than that, I'm not sure of the exact process.. I was in attractions.

7rKUmK0qaa	yes this is true only before she gets approved for a visa because they dont want her to come to US to work so they want to make sure that she is going to US to visit only and her having a lot of money in her acct is proof that she has no point of working in US since she has money in the Philippines and this is also a proof that she will return on time before her I94 expires.    They want to make sure she comes to US w money from Phil and not returning to Phil w/ US money.    US embassy would think" why would you want to come to America to visit if you are broke?"    EDIT: if she already got approved then that means she already showed them her SHOW MONEY....  You dont get approved without showing your "show money".  Once she gets her visa providing she got approved all she has to do is buy a round trip ticket to go there. But when you get to the US immigration which is located in any US international airport most of the time they ask how much shes bringing. She doesnt need a lot of show money. I brought $300 bucks w me and it was fine..    If you havent met her yet I suggest you visit her first..  Lots of scam nowadays.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Visitors visas for single persons are rarely approved. The main thing they must show is not so much money as it is family and business ties as proof of "intent to return".    If her visa was already approved she would not need any "show money"! I seriously think your getting lined up for a scam. Did you meet this woman on the internet in a chatroom or on filippina heart ? Sending money to someone you never met is foolish to say the least and stateside guys get scammed by these internet honeys every single day.|`|UFWyZRLLaa	Go ahead dude..... if you're willing to waste all that money.|`|MrhVcAqZaa	Iris is right there. There is a catch somewhere here. If  a Filipino applies for a tourist visa before she is approved of her visa, she has to present documents and one of those is the bank account showing her latest bank deposit. If she is claiming she got the visa the "SHOW MONEY" won't be necessary. If you have a visa you can already leave for US as she pleases.     Think and re-think it over.|`|AA10258539	njoehow,    No such thing. It is either they have an approved visa or not. The US embassy has never and will never have this requirement AFTER the issuance of the visa. If in doubt, ask her to fax/scan/email the visa in the passport AND the requirement of "show money". Bet she can't.    Tell her - NO DEAL!|`|AA12235069	They would not approve her then ask for further requirements.. She would have to provide those requirements before she gets approved which leads me to the conclusion that there's something that is not right..

It's definitely a scam.. Just be careful..|`|ASA8h9N3aa	The reason the US Embassy requires that is to make sure the "visitor" doesn't forget to return home after their visa runs out.    For example if the person is someone just barely getting by then more then likely they'll prefer to stay in the USA then to return home. Poverty here is a lot better then poverty in the PI. But if you are well enough off then you would be more likely to return then to give up your wealth, well being etc.|`|KWM4RDnBaa	Be careful for fraud/scam artists, they are rampant in the Philippines than what you think.|`|wqP8ACpBaa	It is true--but not after getting approved, you need it before you get approved. And it might be true as well for tourist visas for other countries.    Although as already been mentioned by others, it is not enough that you have "money" in the bank. They can just as easily see that the money has been "deposited" all at one time & possible a few days or weeks before. What would seal it are a business on your name or a good paying job at a well known company, a property title under your name, careers in show business or in the government, money that has been in the bank for a long amount of time, & other interests that would say that you have something to come back to in the Philippines, rather than overstay & live illegally in the US. (We did kick them out, the US, twice, so although Filipinos get immigrant visas probably more than any other country every year, tourist visas are a little bit harder to come by. They probably still haven't gotten over what the Filipinos did-when we said that we do not want to be governed by them & by kicking out all the US military bases in the country.)|`|AA11212130	Hey mate,     No embassy in the Philippines, or anywhere in the world for that case, would require anyone they have already issued a visa to, to provide "show money" or any form of guarantee that they can support their stay in the place of embarkment. That kind of documents are requested during the filing of application but NEVER EVER AFTER.     The possible question for this is, how well do you know this friend of yours. It sure is a hoax. You may want to check out first what she is up to.     Hope this helps.|`|sSTXLQEUaa	Hi. What everyone's saying here is true. The embassy requires you to present proof of funds before the granting of the visa, never after. Something smells fishy here. Let's not jump into conclusions and assume your friend is a scammer. Perhaps she just needs pocket money to finance her travel to the US. Am I correct to assume that you'll shoulder her travel expenses? If so, discuss this arrangement with your friend. Most women you'll meet online (not all) are not financially well-off. She might not have enough funds to spend on her own and might be embarrassed to open this up with you and had to resort to other means. Have a discussion with her about this. Then again there's this possibility that your friend might be of dubious character. Be careful with people you meet online. Why not meet her first here in the Philippines and see what she's like? It might not be the best idea to invite a stranger to stay with you in your home, especially someone you've never met (I assume). Online interaction is never as good as face-to-face.    I've read some of your answers and questions. You seem like a good man, sincerely wanting to move on with life with a new partner. Good luck in your search. Online might not be the best way. Why not schedule a trip and meet some of these women for real? Good luck and be safe. There are good women out there, don't despair.|`|tPxvm6yaaa	That's correct! She won't be needing the "show money" anymore if the visa has already been approved. How long have you known this friend of yours? This could be a trap! An international organized syndicate. So be careful.

You also could have gotten up and stood in the aisle for awhile.      After the fact your only recourse is with the airline unfortunately.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Airline only.  FAA does not care about these things.|`|xjW5tnJcaa	contact the airline!|`|6egxGam6aa	You'll have to address your concern with the airline; the Federal Aviation Administration does not deal with consumer complaints, and I'm not sure which organization you meant with the second abbreviation (NSTA is the National Science Teachers Association).|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Karen, you need to  contact (in writing) to the airline that you flew. What you needed to do was to push the Flight Attendant call button when the other person sat down  and took up a lot of your space. The flight crew could have done something to help you, and would have at least taken your name and recorded this event for management to handle later.    Regards,  Dan
gSqYTJNtaa	I lived in Lahaina for three years and loved it.  Depending on what you want to get out of your Maui experience there are different places I would suggest living.  If you want to be around a lot of activities such as dining, golf, fishing, beaches, etc. I would suggest living in one of the communities on the west side (Lahaina, Kaanapalli, Honokowai, Napili, or Kapalua).      If you want to be in a place a little closer to nature and off the beaten path, I would suggest living upcountry (Kula, Makawao, Hai'ku, Pukalani).  Super peaceful and beautiful up there, I'm bummed I never got  a chance to live up there.    Good luck with your move.  Aloha|`|SQWvMx6Maa	I suggest Lahaina  but here is a list of a few towns and you can decide which is best for you  http://www.hawaii-guide.com/index.php/ma...|`|PheTyRryaa	Maui has very rude/mean people.     But if you really want to move there id say Lahaina but weather wise id say up country like Pukalani side.|`|vVUzDh8Caa	Depends how much money you have, on kaanapalli beach is nice if you can afford it. (kinda touristy).|`|YhECDSKRaa	Using the words city & Maui in the same sentence is kind of a stretch.  The county seat is Wailuku & right next to it is Kahului, where the airport & largest mall are.  Put them together & they still don't feel much like a city.  But those are two of the more populated areas, they are on the northern end of the isthmus.  The community college & hospital are also located there, so most of the non-tourism related jobs will be in the Wailuku/Kahului area. Lahaina is on the western end of the island & has a mix of tourism & residential.  Kihei is on the southwest coast & has lots of condos.  It will be one of the more affordable areas.  Myself, I would prefer to live upcountry, if I lived on Maui.  It is a bit cooler there & the views are wonderful.|`|fYed2Crjaa	Well by city i assume you mean town lol. I would say the westside of maui meaning Lahaina and all the surrounding areas: honokawaii, Napili, Kahana, ect.  They are all about 15 minutes away from town, AKA Lahaina, at the most.

Ca43aXW1aa	San Diego! It's safer, prettier, and smaller. The fact that it isn't as huge as L.A. gives it more of a community feel to it. It's a great versatile place. I go to L.A. a lot but it's not as nice and clean as San Diego. I would highly recommend San Diego as a place for settling. Also if you care about little things like traffic...the L.A. traffic is known for driving people crazy! Two hours of waiting when you should only have to drive for half an hour to get there. Downtown San Diego is beautiful, downtown Los Angeles is extremely far from impressive. Oh and I have found that people in San Diego are generally less snobby than L.A. people. If you have kids, San Diego can offer better school districts. You can find good food in either of the two places. Los Angeles ranges from very clean and upscale to very dirty; San Diego--no matter what class--is cleaner. It's America's finest city!|`|FGCjgc8Raa	San Diego cleaner by far better air safer beaches not so many make believers.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	SAN DIEGO    reasons:  we have the sexiest people  we have THE best football team in the NFL  we have the best beaches  we have the best bars  our schools are safer for our kids  you can go to mexico in 10 minutes  beach, mountains, and snow all in a 1 day trip  our air is cleaner  the people are nicer  & did i mention we have the best football team in the NFL?  :]|`|af4d72c6339f8a97cd7f346b9bb5634faa	Just depends on the person if they are looking for culture then live in LA if you want less culture and cleaner air San Diego.

95j0OdMxaa	I don't eat meat for 40 days. I don't eat dairy products,either, for most of the time.<br>  I agree with cpinatsi: when I fast, I feel better, I lose weight, not to mention that my cholesterol levels go down because I don't eat feta cheese. :-)|`|ZwG5aAVyaa	I won't.<br>  Vasiliki is right, it's not just the food, you've got to try to become a better person.<br>  Plus, you need to make a confession (right word?) before you end the Lent.<br>  Only kids are allowed to drink milk, but there are plenty of greek recipes for fast that could make it easier.But still, food is the least you have to think about.<br>  As everyone else said, if you want to do it, do it right.|`|hgkJej73aa	it's actually 50 days...it started 3 weeks ago. this period of 3 weeks is called the triodio. the first week we eat everything..even meat on wednesdays and fridays, the second week is a normal week with fasting normally on wednesday and friday and the third week (this week) is called i evdomada tis tirinis where dairy products and fish, but no meat can be consumed. then starting on monday is i megali sarakosti which is 40 days long (7 weeks). during this period i am one of those who chose to do the fast ( i have also done the triodio) i will not eat meat, dairy products or fish (except for shell-fish) and during holy week i will also not consume oil. <br>  there is a reason that it is 40 days...it is symbolic of the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert with no food. <br>  many of the answers that i have read to this question seem to miss the point of the fast. orthodox christians (of all ethnic groups, not just greek, i have a friend who is chinese orthodox for example) fast to show there faith to God (not to show off to the ppl around them, pls dnt misunderstand me on that) during this time it is not just what goes into ur mouth that counts..it is also what goes out of your mouth. Of course the holy fathers of the church did not choose this specific time that we have to be careful what we say, we must be careful all year round. however, as we are approaching the holiest day of the year, pascha, we have to be even more careful of what we say (not being mean, not getting into fights with other ppl etc)<br>  so, yes since the age of 8 and now im 17, i fast regularly|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	I agree with Vasiliki on that. The best is to be humble, good with people all around the year, most of those who go every sunday to church and pretend to be good christians, are the ones who judge others and never lose a chance to gossip their neighbor etc....|`|zBSPaC70aa	Actually, Lent is supposed to start on Ash Wednesday, which was yesterday.<br>  <br>  Me, I usually don't eat red meat, but I'm still going to try to up the veggies in my meals and overall eat healthier. I'm going to try to go vegetarian on Fridays.|`|DS9bIexNaa	I will for healthy reasons.|`|dBVtmrpIaa	That is another pretentious thing people do (preferably in a suffering way how brave and pious they are, making sure everybody knows)<br>  Ha Ha!<br>  I am vegan (no need to fast) and not Christian (boy am I glad)|`|YU471WSsaa	does any body understand why we do a nestia?.... a nestia ..is simple a detox of the body 40 days is  how long it take the body to detox from excess of a years good rich food.. you will feel great if you do a nestia and dont deter from it eating the usally stuff  non diary and no meat.the body needs a good detox every year. and it is as simple as not eating meat or dairy products.it really has nothign to do with faith... but the relegion uses  a nestia to gain the upper hand in " good christians" if you read any of ESSENES text you will see that they did a nestia every year... jesus was a  ESENIAN the positive thign about an nestia is that it gives the bowls a rest and supplements the red blood cells..which in turn feed every organ in the body to function to thier prime..|`|AA11589437	I am vegetarian so I will fast in a way. I suggest to people to fast, to see how nice it feels to detox your body and save animals. <br>  Remember that you need to eat a lot of beans, lentils, soya, nuts, spinach, seafood, veg and fruit, and not only pasta and rice if you fast (you need a source of protein). I personally also eat dairies, I only stop them the week before Easter.<br>  Also, I used to have a bit of anemia before I became vegetarian. In a year of being vegetarian, my hematocrit went up 4 units. It sounds awkward bu it isn't, because lentils, spinach etc. have more iron which is better absorbed if you don't eat meat.<br>  <br>  As for being religious or not, I don't think this is purely religious. I believe it defines Greeks a lot as a tradition. Not the whole 40 days, but at least the Holy Week. Even an atheist, I believe should fast during the Holy Week, something like a common conscience of Greeks everywhere, even if it has nothing to do with religion. The same as we cut the Vasilopita or paint the eggs red. I believe we shouldn't give up our traditions, that is why I make traditional foods and sweets even though I am not generally the noikokyra type.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Not me.<br>  I am not reliigous .I am actually anti-Religious.<br>  <br>  My feast is to be a good person, talking politely and not harm other people.<br>  What I m going to eat doesn't define me as a peson . ( I mean among eggs,milk,red meat,etc)<br>  <br>  Most of people though are only feasting through the Holy Week.<br>  Some others only the Big Friday.|`|0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	I will...i do that every year not so much for religion though..<br>  but i eat dairy products i only keep a fast for any kind of meat.<br>  The Holy Week i keep a fast for dairy too.|`|AA10421518	If you're going to do it, do it right.  Don't be too hard on yourself, though.  If you stumble, just get up and keep going.  I usually try to make it the whole 40 days, but rarely succeed.
AA11875819	If you are interested in attending one of these, the best bet is to visit each campus and decide for yourself.      If you want to talk to some people first, call the college and ask if they have a campus blog site.  Or look on facebook or myspace for groups related to each college.  Then read what people have to say there.    That is at least a place to look.  Good luck.
rvTcDJ6yaa	Bus is probalby the cheapest but its not as fast as train. Try eurolines.com for some options there.     You can get cheap flights at times so try www.skyscanner.net as its a good webite for flying within euope in particular.    I will point out that when I lived in the UK and was earning the british pound ( which goes further than most currencies) scandanavia was EXPENSIVE as an option....I am from New Zealand and a friend from Australia she and her partner had a big mac combo each and when they converted it to aussie dollars it was nearly $50! That would be $60 in NZ$ which is horrifying!!! If you are tight on money go south and east! I can totally recommend Croatia, also Slovenia ( but they don't have much of a rail system) but they are a bit cheaper and they have lovely views and people are nice....it was not a place even on my potential list of places but boy was I glad I went!!     London and Paris are really great cities to see..they have a lot of things to do BUT they are expensive.  Also Prague is a wonderful city...and cheaper than the other cities.  hostels ( shared rooms) are the cheap way ( try www.hostels.com, www.hostelworld.com, www.hostelbookers.com) but some places will be pricey regardless. Try also travelling overnight which saves on accommodation eg i went by bus from zargreb to dubrovnik and it was quite cheap, so I had a bad nights sleep but saved on time and money for accommodation!|`|hMQfAERZaa	For train, check out the national railways of Norway, Sweden and Denmark (listed below). If time is of the essence you should definitely check out the low-fare airline also listed below. All pages should be available in English and flying outside of rush hours and weekends can be really cheap.

2dWlUEimaa	Questions to you, Madame Questioner (and please don't take offense, I'm just trying to give you a heads-up): <br>  <br>  1)Do you have any Greek blood in you yourself (i.e., are your parents or grandparents Greek)?<br>  2) Are you a citizen of the EU?/Do you at least have a residency permit for any EU country already?<br>  3) Will you obtain a visa (a work visa or student visa) prior to arrival in Greece?<br>  <br>  If you have no Greek heritage, have no current EU residency permit or citizenship, have no work visa or student visa for Greece, then you are only allowed to live in Greece technically for 90 days, at which point you must leave the E.U. for 90 days before you may return. Also, during those 90 days you will not be allowed to LEGALLY work (and finding illegal work is becoming more and more difficult).<br>  <br>  Note, your Greek boyfriend can't "sponser" you to stay in Greece (if you two get married, however, then you could apply for a residency permit as the spouse of an EU/Greek citizen). Be aware also that visas must be obtained through the Greek embassy in the country of your nationality prior to your arrival in Greece. You are not able to obtain visas from within Greece. Obtaining a residency permit while in Greece is contingent upon having either 1) Greek heritage, 2) EU citizenship/a current EU residency permit, 3) a valid visa, or 4) a marriage with an EU citizen.|`|DS9bIexNaa	Sometimes is GREAT but some others politics indeed ruin it.But i can't say it's just like heaven neither.|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Well, I go on vacation to Greece for three months during the whole year, every year and it honeslty feels like my home. <br>  I normally live in Cleveland and I am in love with Greece because it feels so homely and loving.

You can compare and contrast the similarites and differences of where you live and Greece because there are so many!   The people, food, weather, ways of life.<br>  I hope your stay there will be just as pleasant as mine.|`|LMo8HaA2aa	Greece is a blessed land. If you want my opinion, in these difficult times, it is better to live in Greece than in the US (where commercialisation is not that high and you can be relatively indipendant). It is easier to move from the US to Greece than from Greece to US at this exactly moment.<br>  Certainly there will be things you will be missing for some time. <br>  I think that your fiance really knows what he is doing.

83vhCGW1aa	Most of the people are friendlier than alot of the people out east.  They move at a slower pace and are more laid back in general.  I think it has something to do with the weather.

As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums. <br>  <br>  The most striking thing I remember from Kraków is the Kraków Hourly Trumpet Signal<br>  <br>  Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Kraków's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Kraków signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of Zywiec.<br>  <br>  Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train from Kraków.<br>  <br>  Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.|`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	Poland , just like 3rd  World country .<br>  Serious racism over there  , antisemitism  -a lot of  morons and uneducated people .

Flying into the smaller airports, like Flagstaff, would cost more money and there aren't that many airlines that fly into Flagstaff.  Plus, you always have to make connections.

Europe consists of 47 independent countires; 25 of them have concluded a common travel agreement which opens up their internal borders and requires foreign tourists only to hold one visa.    You may visit Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France (to include Andorra and Monaco), Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy (to include San Marino and Vatican City), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain (to include Andorra), Sweden, and Switzerland (to include Liechtenstein) together visa free for up to 90 days in a 6 months period if you hold a passport of Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Macao (SAR), Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, Vatican City, and Venezuela.    If you should hold another citizenship you willl need a visa which must be applied for at the counrtry in which you plan to stay the longest. If you plan to hop countries and stay eqaully distributed you must apply at the first country you plan to enter the Schengen zone.    Other countries which do not belong to the Schengen area like the United Kingdom and Irland have different entry requirements which may be checked on the sources provided.

UF8qU5cGaa	It depends on your citizenship. If you're an EU citizen you can work and live in any EU country (and the EEA zone).<br>  <br>  The Carta di Soggiorno is also a residency permit. It is more like the US “green card” in that it is a permanent document. Whereas the Permesso di Soggiorno has to be renewed, the Carta di Soggiorno does not expire, and needs to be renewed periodically only if you want to use it as a form of identification.<br>  <br>  The requirements for obtaining a Carta di Soggiorno are slightly different for EU and non-EU citizens. EU citizens can apply for the Carta di Soggiorno immediately after their arrival in italy, in contrast to non-EU citizens that have to accumulate enough time as a resident in Italy to apply for the Carta.<br>  <br>  So, it's back to where are you from?

If you have not yet applied for visa then it should be ok because there is about 5 year waiting list to be accepted if you have enough for their points system - money, young, a qualification for work, a job to go to, a house to live in and a sponsor preferably.

ec86307383a6069c2c60c1710620bb01aa	I stayed across the street before at the Doubletree Guest Suites.  You are in the heart of Times Square.  There is a ton of things to do.  Of course, if you want to really know where to go eat, ask some of the locals, ask the hotel staff, etc.  You'll probably get some answers off of here too.  I found a really good Chinese restaurant on 8th Avenue between 51st and 52nd Street.  The Hampton Inn Suites across the street recommended it.  I've eaten there twice on two different trips now.  Great prices and a lot of food.  I don't remember the name of it, but it's on the opposite side of the street of the Hampton Inn Suites Hotel.  Good luck and have fun!

7PMpJqiiaa	What ambience and amenities are you looking for?  There are different areas of Maui, each has its own charm:    *  The major stretch of beach and resorts in Maui is Kaanapali Beach, right next to the town of Lahaina.  Kaanapali Beach is lined along its entire length with glamorous hotels, the best which is the Grand Hyatt.  I also like the Westin.  Usually, it is $350+/night here, but I'm sure there are great deals right now.  There is one hotel, the original hotel on the beach called the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel which will get you into this area for much much less.  The service is very warm and sincere, maybe better than the other hotels, but the hotel is very dated, needs an overhaul.  Lahaina has the most shopping and galleries of any area in Maui.    *  The "upscale" beach is Wailea / Makena beaches.  It is much smaller than Kaanapali Beach.  The Four Seasons Wailea is the nicest hotel here, but the Grand Wailea always seems to get a lot of rave reviews; a fantasy of fountains and tropical courtyards, right on Wailea beach.  Usually, hotels are more than at Ka'anapali, maybe $500+/night. There is an upscale shopping complex here, but less shopping otherwise.      *  The Napili Bay and Kapalua area is an isolated area of Maui, past Kaanapali.  Prices are slightly less because it is harder to get to. It reminds me a bit of Carmel and Pebble Beach, with windswept views, a swanky golf course and nice homes.  The Ritz Carlton Hotel is here, but there are lesser digs around Napili Bay.  There is very little shopping here (a small center only) but the snorkeling is great.  You will see sea turtles.  http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties...    *  Most of the beach areas are in the drier and more sunny areas of the island.  If you want to be on the isolated, windward (wet, jungle) side of the island, then go to Hana for that "South Seas castaway" ambience.  There is a well-known resort called the Hana Maui Resort ($500+ although there are probably deals right now) and a smaller property called the Hana Kai Maui Resort ($250).  If you want to hike in the jungle this area is for you! Be warned however that the road to Hana is windy and takes a few hours to get there.  And did I mention how isolated it is ;-) ?  http://www.hotelhanamaui.com/  http://www.hanakaimaui.com/    I am assuming you are wanting to be on the beach, but there are also small inns and B&B's on the highlands of Mt. Haleakala, in the town of Kula.  Great views and cooler, but not a lot here in my mind for more than a night or two.    Hope this helps you.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	Wailea|`|NdOwsxsqaa	My mom and dad are taking me on a cruise to hawaii and we are staying at the Mauna Kea Hotel.

Enjoy your stay.|`|AA11852997	If you're looking economical, the Maui Seaside Hotel in Kahului isn't bad. If you're looking for a place to stay at all day and be pampered, I wouldn't go there.
