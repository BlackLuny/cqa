Putting the nation trillions of dollars more in debt is not stimulus, it will take generations to pay this off.    Your measly $500 dollar stimulus check will add $2,600 dollars to your part of the national debt.  And yes it was bad when Bush did it too.|`|Yzcptoagaa	5% is going to road and bridge repair.

Be on guard.|`|0BARGHg6aa	Because it is not about the People...it's about the Banks.    As stated by true Free-Market Economists (visit www.mises.org), this "stimulus" bill will not stimulate the economy.  It only serves to devalue our money further.  You cannot dig yourself out of a hole, likewise, you cannot spend your way out of a mess that was started by too much expansion of credit, which is Government spending too much.    I wouldn't call this a bi-partisan issue.  So-called Republicans voted for the first bailout.  They only opposed this bailout because a Democrat is in office.  At least this bill told us where the money was going.  They can't even track the last $700 Billion.

AA11440601	Of course.    It may not be politically correct but any group of believers has the right to pray for the conversion of the rest of the world.    In fact, Pope Benedict did change the prayer a bit:    The old prayer:    Let us pray for the Jews, that the Lord our God will take away the veil from their hearts, so that they too may recognize our Lord Jesus Christ  Let us pray,  Let us kneel,  Rise.  Almighty and everlasting God, you do not without your mercy either from the Jews; listen to our prayers for these unseeing people, that they may receive the light of your truth, which is Christ himself, and so be brought out of their darkness.    The new prayer:    Let us also pray for the Jews: That our God and Lord may enlighten their hearts, that they acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men.   Let us pray.   Let us bend our knees.  Rise.  Almighty and eternal God, who wants that all men be saved and attain the knowledge of the truth, propitiously grant that as the fullness of the Gentiles enters Thy Church, all Israel be saved. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.    http://www.cfnews.org/goodfriday.htm    With love in Christ.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	Prayers don't convert. People do. All the words in the world won't change a person who isn't willing.|`|AA11702773	They have a right to pray anything they want.|`|TxRRITveaa	we pray for the conversion of everyone.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Just because someone gets offended doesn't mean you don't have the right to do it. It just means someone will get offended.    If you think you are correct, and  have a spine, you stick by your guns and take the flack, and do what is right.    When the American Congress was debating the Declaration of Independence they were editing out bit after bit after bit on the grounds that it would be offensive to different people. When they took out a bit that they were afraid would offend their supporters in Parliament, John Adams jumped up and yelled "This is a REVOLUTION, Dammit! We have to offend SOMEBODY!!!"    Bottom line, you can't have an impact in the world and be inoffensive at the same time.     Simon Rosenthal has every right to be offended, he has every right to protest, but just because he is offended doesn't mean that the Vatican therefore looses it's right to say what it wants.  At least not in a free country.|`|bZud91iuaa	Please don't pray for my conversion thank you. The Catholic Church has pretty much done what it has wanted throughout history, so why are you surprised at this?  Rights never were a consideration for the Church, only the fear and power they could wield over the masses and it has worked.  Rosenthal should just let it go and this too shall pass.  I doubt many Catholics really believe a Jew would convert and if they do the percentage is very small anyway.  That person was probably looking for a way out as it is.    Shalom!!  Amen!!|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Of course it's within their right.  They also pray for the conversion of the Protestants, Atheists, Hindus, etc.  It's part of their faith - they believe they are the one true faith and anyone who does not join them will suffer for it.    This is why it's so important to keep religion and state separate; so that ideological biases don't interfere with the rights or freedoms of dissenters (yes, I know the Vatican is a state unto itself - I mean in the free world.)|`|AA11101968	I suppose it's their right to do what ever they want, they are a sovereign nation, but how could they not see the can of worms they were opening?|`|tkX8VMDSaa	Do not all Religions try to convert ?  I see no problem with it even though I have distanced myself from any  organized Religion.|`|7BT7XYeuaa	yes....they have that right......    its their religion.    The whole idea of religion is very subjective and implies that your group, your religion is somehow more favorable in the eyes of GOD than others.    That guy is also free to now have a prayer in his religion asking for the conversion of catholics to his religion.....its a free "world".|`|6JXrlnYsaa	The Catholic Church is just that, a church.  They have the absolute right to have whatever prayers they want, just as any church does.    Simon Rosenthal can object all he wants, and ask for anything.  Whether he gets it is entirely up to the pope.|`|pgdTmT6caa	They can pray what they want.  And the Jews can do what they want.  If they want to convert, which many do, that's fine.  In Jesus time most of the Jews saw Jesus as their Messiah and followed him.  Many did not.  Jesus preached in the Temple and people were in agreement with his teachings.  Jews today do not read the new testament so I can see there fear.  They do not want to change there traditions.  They do not have to change their traditions because they convert to Christianity.  There are many Christian Jews that have not abandoned their traditions but have accepted Jesus as their Messiah.

That doesn't have anything to do with my gender but my education and 15 years experience.  In my field, if a woman makes less than a male co-worker it is due to ability to do the job and poor work habits.  If she constantly has to seek out a man to do lifting for her and refuses to work overtime (very common in my trade), her raises will be smaller than someone who does all of their won work and volunteers to work whenever needed.|`|uEyxjAdcaa	If companies could hire women to do the same work for less pay, why are men still employed?

Recently I along with the two other guys filed a joint grievance with our union asking that one of the three of us be promoted into that position.  All three of us have also refused to do any more of the work involved with the position until the grievance has been decided upon.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	I see no problem as long as equal work does indeed get equal pay. But let's be real. There is some work so physical that a woman would never be able to do. I worked in a ice plant earlier in my life. I'd like to see a woman completely lift a 300lbs block of ice and move it onto a delivery truck. For other jobs that are not as physical, all people should be considered equal based on equal performance.     And that's the problem. Performance. There is a lot of leeway with that measurement.|`|sxecXFgraa	If women want equal pay then women need to be just as aggressive in the work force.  I know some women are but not a lot.  There are plenty of studies out showing women don't negotiate salaries as well as men, we don't ask for pay raises as well or as often as men, and we don't job hop as often as men do.

AA11296044	Those at the top who still do have jobs are sure making a lot of money.    Sure most people are spending less, however they will just cut manufacturing costs by employing children and drop the prices so that you can once again afford to buy it.    CEO's will continue to get richer, jobs will stay overseas however you will be able to buy a big screen TV for $200.    A lot of the problem lays with the consumer.   People do look for the aboslute rock bottom price and business needs to be able to offer it to compete.      If people were willing to pay a little more to support jobs in their community, buy domestic goods then companies may be more willing to manufacture domestically.    That doesn't give business a free pass, many companies outsource to increase margins, not to offer lower prices.  It is no secret who these companies are.   However they are still around (and thriving) becouse people support them.    I cannot scream this enough, buy locally.  You would be surprised at what you can find in your communities main street.  Many business offer  domestic products at great prices.   Many work directly with local merchants, many even manufacture within your community.  Buy from them.    I realize in our cuthroat busy world it is just easier to head to Wal-Mart and Target and buy everything, however easier isn't better.   The Easier way has contributed to where we are today.    Buy domestic.|`|ca866ce419e17f58cd9673fde5feac8faa	The popular press has a habit of telling us about all the manufacturing jobs were exportingbut few of those articles explore what I think is the obvious question: If all those jobs are disappearing, why is unemployment so low?     The answer is: We are morphing into a service economy, and have been for a long time.  The obsolete manufacturing jobs that have either moved offshore (making blue jeans) or vanished altogether (making buggy whips) are being more than replaced by new service sector jobs.  The reason we hear a lot about the jobs that went away, but very little about new jobs, is because its very easy for journalists to track down and interview on video tape those people whose jobs were exportedbut it is very difficult to find the people who are about to fill all the new jobs being created, largely in the service sector.       Granted, that does not make it any more pleasant for those whose jobs are going away.  Lets face it, not many of us relish the prospect of losing our jobs.  On the other hand, most of us expect our standard of living to continue increasing.  But we simply cant have it both ways.  If we want our standard of living to increase, we have to cope with the churn, the process that creates new jobs, products, and services that displace the old jobs, products, and services.  We in the USA have chosen to emphasize (and cope with) the process of creative destruction; the Euro zone in general has instead chosen to emphasize protecting old jobs.  Many think thats the primary explanation for the higher growth rate in our region (and I'm one of them).       Below is the chart from page 10 (Chapter 5) of the IMF report,  Note that the USA is less industrialized than most other countries on the chart, including Thailand, India, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia.  I bet theyre getting a lot of those manufacturing jobs were exporting.  But also note one other thing: the USA is the wealthiest economy on the chart.  Thats because we have progressed to a service economy.     http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/...    Whats the big deal about a service economy, if were just a bunch of hamburger-flippers?  That was one sides wisecrack about our service economy in a long-ago presidential campaign (Reagan vs Mondale in 1984, to be specific; guess who made the wisecrack).     Well, I bet the current and future employees of Google would take issue with being called hamburger-flippers.  Be sure to read the article titled The Information Factories in Wired Magazine, by George Gilder (...and if you dont know who George Gilder is, youd better Google him).  Google is a builder, in a big, big way, and what they are doing in The Dalles, on the Columbia River in Oregon, is a microcosm example of our continuing transformation into a service economy.  (Hint: There's a lot of inexpensive electrical power at that site in Oregon.)    http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10...    I'm thankful that at least one person (George Gilder) is writing about how our economy is creating new jobseven though its difficult to locate any of those future new employees, to get their big smiles on videotape for the six-oclock news.|`|YjW5r6N5aa	BUSINESSES decided to export jobs because of the super high corporate tax rate, union restrictions, legalities, etc. This, in part, makes production in other countries cheaper.|`|N3S9S1joaa	And the jobs that were left here were taken by the Mexicans with our governments blessings.

DkwgogXZaa	please tell me if he really is...i thought he was trying to do bi-partisanship|`|DlQd0m0Daa	Never happen this is why---    Democrats plan to undermine public confidence in President George W. Bush by challenging his credibility and raising doubts about America, sources within the party tell Capitol Hill Blue.    A multi-pronged attack against Republicans and the President will focus not only on economic issues, but question American values, raise doubts about how this country is viewed by other nations and question the patriotism of Bush and his party.    The extensive campaign, developed by senior Democratic consultants and party leaders, was launched last week with attacks on the Bush economic plan by Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Richard Gephardt.    In coming weeks, Democratic elected officials will question the Presidents intentions on the pending war with Iraq. Writers and broadcasters friendly to the Democratic cause have already been provided talking points suggesting the war is about oil, not terrorism.    The talking points were developed before the end of last year and sent out to operatives and friendly media, one Democratic consultant confided. No Democratic member of Congress will question the Presidents patriotism openly but we will use the media and other surrogates to raise doubts.    Capitol Hill Blue obtained a copy of the talking points when the Democratic National Committee sent them to a news outlet recently acquired by CHBs parent company. The talking points outline a strategy to raise public doubts of the Presidents real intentions, including:    --Saying the war is about oil and will be fought to benefit oil companies that have long supported Bush and the Republican party;    --Claiming the Bush administration has manufactured evidence against Saddam Hussein and used that evidence to encourage Britain and other allies to join the American fight against Iraq;    --Suggesting a wartime economy is the only way the administration can revive the countrys lagging economic situation.    It is clear that the current approval ratings of the administration are tied directly to strong American feelings toward traditional values, the talking points say. To counter this, doubt must be raised as to Americas true position within the world community and the true intent of the Bush administration in waging war.    Some Democrats admit privately they are uneasy with the party strategy to undermine American values in an attempt to get Bush.    My boss doesnt want anything to do with it, one senior Senate aide told Capitol Hill Blue on Monday. You dont undermine this country to win elections.    Others, however, are willing to try anything to put the White House and Congress back under Democratic control.    The real war isnt in Iraq, one Democratic consultant said. Its right here at home, at the ballot box in 2004.    Among the other points Democrats hope to make in the coming weeks:    --Both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are controlled by oil and defense industry special interest groups.    --The war on terrorism is a failure because Osama bin Laden is still at large.    --America is unprepared for another terrorist attack because of White House preoccupation with Iraq.    --War will increase the countrys economic woes.    --Bush will be forced to raise taxes to finance the war.    Its time to take the battle to the people and make them understand just how dangerous George W. Bushs policies are to the future of America, the talking points conclude.    Democratic sources say the talking points were developed by Democratic Chairman Terry McAuliffe, former Clinton campaign strategist James Carville, Senate Majority Leader Daschle and former House Democratic Leader Gephardt.    This is a classic, Jim Carville, scorched earth campaign, crows one DNC staffer. Take no prisoners. Thats how you win elections.

But, this is single biggest chance for Liberals to impose an almost irrevocable government presence in the lives of every Americans. Don't kid yourself, this isn't a stimulus package in any sense. This is the liberal agenda attempting to tsunami the entirety of the American populous, while simultaneously solidifying themselves in power for generations to come. If we all are forced to depend upon the government for ever aspect of our lives, those politicians that know this will not work (as it has not in any country throughout history, most recently in Japan in the 90's) will be marginalized to the point of obscurity. Americans are about to be victims of the greatest political con in the history of our country, and when it's over, our country will not exist anymore|`|cz9OLJtAaa	The only way to support our economy with the stimulus package is to go to a garage sale or buy a hooker!|`|IEpTAtrsaa	It is when you are trying to push a gazillion things through on the bill that is buried deep in the many pages where no one notices.  Things would get done a lot faster and bills would have a better chance of passing if they focused on one per bill.  Stop with the 500pg bills!!!!
HlD9dRF2aa	This package will do exactly what it was designed to do if it passes the Senate vote and is signed into law by Obama.  All the government agencies will be well funded and they won't have to downsize government.  H.R.1 wasn't designed to stimulate the economy. It is Obama's proposal with Democratic congressional earmarks all over it.    They sold this bill to America as a "Stimulus" package.  In actuality it is congress plundering the U.S. treasury to feed government programs. (It's your tax dollars so why should they care?).      So the blame falls on  Pop Culture America who voted in the leaders passing these laws.  The people that have never bothered to even skim over a piece of legislation in their lives when all it takes is a Yahoo or Google search.  All it would have taken is for everyone in the country with a 6th grade reading level to scan the contents of H.R.1. the American (Government) Recovery Reinvestment Act 2009 and liberals and conservatives of rational thought alike would have screamed "H*LL NO!"    And for all those Bush bashers out there -- NEWS FLASH!  George Bush isn't the president anymore. This is Obama's/Congress' bill, on (D)Nancy Pelosi's watch, with (D)Harry Reed's blessing and the American taxpayer's indifference.  Blame those who will actually be responsible.  All credit or most likely blame will fall on Obama, Congress (D), the Senate (D), and the people that voted them into power.|`|8juUgSK2aa	myself. I should of worked harder.|`|AA11540917	who started this awful mess ?    who is responsible for the First stimulus package that got the ball rolling ?    that is who we should blame !

They're already doing it.|`|X81oLqMtaa	It has to fail first.     And you can bet that Obama will be using the bully pulpit to point out every single success he can pin on it.      Afterall, like all the 1st term Presidents before him, he is campaigning for a 2nd term right now.    The House GOP may have painted itself in the corner.  Boehner would have been smart to allow a few House Republicans to vote in favor of it.|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	ummmm, where have you been the last 10 years?  You do realize that Bush had a stim plan -- twice and that he bailed out the finanical people and oh by the way, he spent trillions on a war we didn't need????  I am not saying that you are for Bush or anything but your questions seems silly considering we have dealt with money being flushed down the crapper for the last 8 years.  By the way, you do realize that this stim package isn't going to magically fix the economy don't you?  This is one step of hundreds that need to be taken in order to get the country back on track.  So are you going to be complaining when all of a sudden you don't have to pay hundreds of dollars a month for healthcare soon?  Think not.|`|83d974bd6563fd1273c1a961b2f98155aa	It won't fail.|`|fHTvjaYtaa	Great question.  What gets me is the stupid things The Dems put in this 600 page bill.  Like Millions for the study of STD's. Come on.  The stupid things these people in Congress come up with I do not understand.  It is totally Bogus as you specified.  This is just more stupid spending.  Personally, I will blame the Congress and all who voted for this bill.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	If they succeed they are hero's and will boast like crazy.

But in reality, it's the morons who elected him, and then spent well beyond their means who are to blame.|`|8HgvkFowaa	If it fails, I will blame the people that did not spend the money. We're not given the money to put away. We are given it to spend. Not enough money is being spent, that's why they give it out.

And the stupid people that thought it was a good idea.|`|aGzh5e7Haa	people are sooooo quick to blame and judge.....      atleast give the new administration a chance!      you're already setting them up for failure....|`|0F1775TVaa	Yup, not a single republican voted for it and 11 democrats voted against it too ha    Not their precious Obama. probably Frank, or someone who doesn't have much meaning in it, so it won't be such a bang to their ego.|`|OUTydKLFaa	Democrats for the bill.

If it is a success then props to the president and his party...but we will still be so far in debt that any success is going to surely be overridden by the fact that we are digging our country deeper into the hole.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	They'll still blame everything on Bush...for at least another year, at least.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	How about the Republicans, who started this problem 8 years ago.    And oh yes, the dumb-*** Americans who were asleep at the switch while we were going down the drain    Simple, really|`|Gsq05hXCaa	I blame the schools. lol, just kdding. I would blame Barney Frank, Pelosi, Obama, and Bill Clinton. Some may think why Clinton? well its because he is the original cause of this recession when the banks were de-regulated during his admn.Obama knows theres a whole crap load of pork barrel spending that he claimed there would be none of during his campaign....lets just chock that up as another lie he said during his campaign. But we all knopw that the blame will be pinned soleyl on Bush, no matter what. I mean, Obama could physically shoot someone right in front of TV cameras, and it would be Bush's fault and Obama would get off Scott free.(and i'm not a dem)
LzsGNlOraa	Negative 600.  That is where Obama wants America to be.  Good question!|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Like BOGG above said, is it possible to have a negative credit score?|`|reeU4N0eaa	Higher than the dem Congress' collective IQ|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Nice!|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I would say in the poor range and the report would tell lenders that I would be a risky customer!|`|RZknHOkbaa	I wonder why you asked the question like that...maybe it is that someone has suggested that an individual cannot spend there way back to prosperity?    The problem is that the Bush Administration has left the country in a big hole and it is time for the government to respond.    So time for a little liberal schooling in the basicis of econ 101    The government has three options on the actions it can take to try and stave off the worsening of a bad situation.  1-Cut taxes and leave more money in the hands of the people themselves to let them use it so that they can drive their own recovery. The problem with that is two-fold.  First, we have had tax cuts in place for the last 7-8 years, and no matter what anyone says...we still dove into a recession.  Second, history has shown that when a nation is in a recession and people have more money that one of two things happen, they do not spend the money in a way that will benefit the recovery (check out what the banks did with the first bail out as an example) and with the shortage of cash there is an increase in prices and people subsequently buy less, or they spend the money and with the excess cash inflation drives the price of everything down and there is a subsequent drop in production, because manufacturers want to make a profit.   So that option leaves two very poor choices, increased prices and less money in the market, or too much money in the market and less production.    2-Do nothing---yes that is always a policy option, stand back and let the economy fix itself.  The problem with that is that we would have to leave the current tax cuts in place, and as discussed above those have failed to properly support the economy.    3-Take action--revitalize the economy by supplying jobs and programs that will inject money back into the market.   The stimulus plan will put money back into the market slowly, to avoid the dual issues discussed in  1. Also the money will go back into the market by way of the salaries of those who are put back to work implenmenting the programs.  Who will then spend their money on commodities, which will improve the buying power of the stock market...this is Keynesian Economic Theory at it's most basic.    So the answer to your question is no, that plan you describe is not good for an individual, but yes it is good for a nation....|`|sJeR0kzUaa	I LOVE this question!!!  Thank You

There is nothing to do there for your family but freeze your butts off!!!  Choose the place that is best for you, your family, and your career.  Good luck in your decision, and in your career.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	I loved Ft carson Co. Good schools, and Colorado Springs is very nice. Also you are about 30-40 Minutes from Denver.

I think you should go for it and i wish you the best of luck!  x|`|V5xHaIAcaa	You have nothing left to loose ???    That is obvious|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I liked the Army better.  I spent 2 of my 9 years working with the AF.  I feel they are a little more strict.  In the Army we just did the job.  The Air Force has too much paperwork, forms, and regulations about everything.    In the Army when you have to pee you just go pee.  The Air Force guys had to fill out permission slips.  Like a grown-up hall pass.  I like Army uniforms better.    You will like either one.  Just join and advance yourself.|`|KcAehrrKaa	It's up to you, but I wouldn't join any branches of the military.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	if you are going to join the militar i would say join the airforce.. every guyin my family did and it changed teheri life for the better. join it and if you dont like it get out when your term is up.. if i was to join i would join the the airforce. but then again the government is a little screwy right now with the new prez and what not that i would not want the government to be owning me in that sense. but i suggest The airforce it helps pay and you wont see much combat if you happen to go to war...... but thats just me|`|AA10446600	If you think that you would like it, then you should.

Have you decided what you would like to do in the AirForce?|`|xTpvnWRuaa	Honestly, if it's your calling and you can do it and if it will help you, which it really seems to do, I'd say go for it.    Why? Because you only have ONE youth, meaning the older and older you get, you won't be able to do the things PHYSICALLY you once did, like join the air force.    When you're young is the best time for it, and you can always do the other things you didn't do during that time frame when you are older because they won't be anywhere as physically taxing and you can handle it.    If you don't go to the airforce now, then 10 years from now, etc etc, it won't be as easy for you to handle.|`|LMGWEPBtaa	If you want to go to college go. Do not get side tracked with the air force.

You know what?  You should!

Trust me on this, I just retired after 22 years and what I did for 22 years (aircraft mechanic) is pretty much worthless on the outside right now (I'm still unemployed after 3 months of heavy job searching). I would seriously find something that interests you and seems to be good on the outside, then decide which branch you want to join. Here's another true story that you may or may not know: The Navy has more airplanes than the Air Force, but the Army has more boats than the Navy! Pretty strange, but true!|`|AA11601127	I am also thinking about joining the Air Force Reserves.  Perhaps that would be better for you as well.  You kind of seem to have one foot in on the idea, and the reserves is a great way for you to get money for college, provide you with essential job skills, provide you with an income, set you up for affordable health care.  Also,  you seem to be young so the experience would speak loudly on your future job interview/resumes.

What is disconcerting is that the man in charge, a supposedly a canny chancellor, sold our gold off cheap - some of it having been in the country 800 years - when right now it is the highest priced metal. We could use that money now. I was made redundant six months ago and have applied for nigh on 100 jobs. I have had 2 interviews out of that. It is worrying. Maybe a depression is about to set in. We have been in a false economy for ten years, this was always going to happen. We are to developed for that to become a third world country. And minerals are not cheap enough here to have sweat shops and large productions of cheap items. You are right though no one would give a **** about us. Funny how we had a massive influence on freedom in europe yet they despise us. And the idea that the europeans would throw us a bone in the euro? would make no difference. Euro stands at 1.02 to GBP 1. Thats down from  around 1.4 this time last year. Would make no odds. What hasn't helped is giving work to a million europeans for last 6 years and have them live five to a house so they can send money back to their own countries therefore boosting their economies when they should be spending money in england.

Labour have bankrupted this country twice so we should really of expected it.

Also because credit isn't readily available as before people cant afford luxuries like new cars or bigger homes that's why these industries are taking a beating. In this country if you are a millionaire well good for you, you are safe - and the government is happy at that. If you live on benefits and can work but don't well good for you to be truthful I cant blame you be lazy and get away with it. But if you are middle class, hard working and are putting everything into this country it is these people being hit the hardest by interests being low for their savings etc etc. If I had my way I would get out and live abroad.

QYXij5Wcaa	I feel more funding is needed, and a re-evaluation  of the American school system is needed. Trade schools should be made open to the public by the government. Furthermore, acceptance to scholarship programs should be based on family income, rather than ethnicity or location of residence. Also, as democracy is fundamental to American society, political science should be made a core subject. Lastly, the theory of creationism should be banned from the classrooms as the Constitution emphasizes on the separation of state and church. It may be taught, if all theories of creationism by all religions be included.|`|h5sjwUo3aa	Modern education for liberals is coming    on Yahoo Answers....        ha ha...    Me?

We have taught our daughter to question everything she is taught, especially in history. Those who question what they learn will seek out the truth on their own. They will want to know if what they have learned is right or wrong, and use that information accordingly.
t3QAaSN9aa	Conservatives are stuck in their ideological rut and no amount of past failure or reasoning will convince some of them to leave that rut.  Tax cuts are not effective in stimulating the economy and never have been.      One current consideration is that state taxes, which are already more regressive than federal tax, will increase to cover state economic problems thereby offsetting any federal tax cut and hitting the people most who can afford it the least. The stimulus package contains aid to the states which should help address this issue.|`|AA11702773	I think I want some of what you are smoking.

And, since there's vanishingly little tax cuts for small business in the "stimulus" package, that's one of the reasons why the Congressional Budget Office says there's no there there when it comes to the massive pork bill's stimulative effects.    The pork bill's infrastructure projects (read: payoff to the constuction & Teamsters unions) will provide an economic benefit 3 to 10 years out. Again, according the Congressional Budget Office. Not too much stimulus there, is there, Bink? PERIOD.    The "Green Technology" component is a payoff to the enviros  PERIOD.    Transfers to the states are payoffs to the teacher's and social workers' unions  PERIOD. After all, where is the "stimulus" in giving money to states that refuse to manage their affairs in even the most basic of responsible fashions. Would YOU give money to a drunken spendthrift? Thought not! PERIOD.|`|PDYdcSliaa	Absolutely!!  The tax cuts that the GOP wants don't work, they never have.

How about "forrest health" or telling kids about STDs?  No one is saying these aren't (semi) important things to work on, but they do NOTHING to stimulate the economy.|`|AA10264185	Spread the wealth needs to take a little math. 875 billion divided by 304 million people is closer to 2900. While that is a hefty tax cut or stimulus check for those few who do not pay taxes, infrastructure projects will most likely bring about more lasting benefits and provide more employment. Forest health will not only provide jobs but in the long run save billions more in lower fire suppression costs and property and resource damages.|`|43zXRpLYaa	Shall I post my ten links that say otherwise?|`|sJeR0kzUaa	80% of this so called stimulus package is not for infrastructure, it is for PORK!!!

rV1uAtt3aa	I think you're being a little cynical.  While it is true that the politics of the last decade have been very divisive, it's also true that both parties and their members gain from working together.      I believe both parties genuinely care for this country and will make concessions in order to reach agreements.  This country was built on compromise, and I think it's still in our nature despite the last 8 years.    There will always be those who refuse to compromise, but I think that way of thinking only gets you left out in the cold - which is why so many Neo-cons feel disenfranchised at the moment.|`|pgdTmT6caa	Yes, he thought he was going to walk in there and instantly have everyone agreeing with him.

Although a long standing goal....not everyone has the same worldview, same core values, same belief system.  The communists tried to homogenize its population to achieve some sort of idealized community.  We are humans, with free will and individuality.  We cannot be homogenized.      So it is theatre and speaks to perceived psychological needs of the populace.  Unfortunately, what politicians have never and apparently will never understand is that it is honesty and integrity that is the most wanted, needed, and appealing quality to seek in a politician (and anyone really.)  People don't have to agree with everything, they can agree to disagree.  But honesty and earned respect would be a nice change.     Can they represent the people they were elected to represent.  Wow.  I wish.  Wouldn't THAT be refreshing.|`|cRHtu3rQaa	Calling for bipartisanship isn't naive, but I may say so, it is needed, but it seems that the House Republicans don't appreciate it. Obama didn't need Republican votes on the stimulus bill, but he still wanted to get them because he wanted to get their opinion, etc. He conceited to Republicans so that ideology wouldn't be a factor, but the good of the country would. Ideology seemed to be more important to them, because not even one Republican voted for the bill after Obama made an effort to work with them, which he didn't have to do.|`|okstbUQJaa	I think it is interesting that the way this question is posed, it puts all of the burden on Republicans to adopt Democratic positions. That is not the expectation, nor the message, from President Obama.  The message is for both sides to come together and find a common ground. To meet somewhere in the middle.    Yes, if either side is expected to drop ideologies and come completely in the direction of one part of the other, this is naive and unrealistic. You have to be realistic in the expectation in order to achieve it.
lvBUl3Zdaa	It's called the "Electoral College".    The votes for each state are tallied up. Each state has a number of "electors", and except for a few states where the vote can be divided, all the electoral votes of a state go to the winner of the general election.     In practice, we watch the tally growing on the television screen as the votes are counted on election night. They announced quite early that Obama had won, as it was clear it was a landslide.|`|4HoVVCenaa	The two democracies are quite different in electoral process. Both are not true democracies, but republics, i.e. representative democracies. Each state has a number of electoral votes based on the population. The state votes for a specific candidate, who, in most cases gets all of the electoral votes base on the majority of votes. Nebraska splits them. The majority of electoral votes determine who is the president.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I'm guessing MP is about the same thing as Senator?  A representative of a certain area in the government.|`|LzsGNlOraa	In America we dont 'vote' for presidents anymore. We vote for American idols. (ie Obama)|`|AA11097492	Yes, they do. Haven't you seen the news anytime in the last year? For months you could guarantee at least one item in every news programme would be about the Presidential election.    Best if you think of the President in the same basic terms as the Queen; except of course the President is elected and has legal authority where the Queen is not elected and has no legal authority whatsoever.    They don't have MP's in the same sense, although members of Congress and the Senate are the equivalent.    Britain might well one day elect an Asian or black PM, but for that to happen they'd have to be leading a UK political party and currently no major party has a leader from any other race than that of the Caucasian race (for simplest definition, white.) We do not directly elect the Prime Minister; the PM is the leader of the party voted into power by a general election; the party chooses the leader, and if the leader changes while the party is the party of government that person then becomes PM.    It's a very simple concept that those who say Gordon Brown has never won an election always fail to grasp. The PM does not have to win an election to become PM; he only has to win a vote within his party.|`|HobgsxXCaa	We are supposed to have a Republic form of government not a Democracy.  The difference you ask?  In a Republic you are ruled by law in a democracy you are ruled by the majority.  Example: Lynch mob votes to hang a man but the sheriff says no we go by the law.    Right now we have a lynch mob in congress, that is the problem
sxecXFgraa	I think he should be focusing on other things right now.  If women want equal pay then women need to be just as aggressive in the work force. I know some women are but not a lot.

Congress is all lawyers and the Lawyer lobby is the most powerful in the country. It's smart of them to make it look like they care about people, but it's also the reason Health Care is way too expensive. All you have to do is look at Malpractice premiums to see that the government will never lower costs unless they propose Tort reform, and the Democrats are the ones who always oppose it. They are the Party of contradiction. They tell you what you want to hear.   A woman in my office is our highest paid employee because she works hard, and another woman is our lowest because she wants to go home at 3:30 to be with her children. Are those factors included in their study? They are common.    Edit: Contradiction is common with Democrats...they oppose Tort Reform and oppose higher insurance premiums (what kind of IQ does not understand this), they supported Ethanol and opposed high corn prices. I could go on and on, but most Americans are driven by a cute little sound bite like "luxury tax on yachts" and say that sounds right, let the rich pay that tax. Then when their local boat building plant lays off 100 people they blame the big bad corporations. It's pathetic.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	No.  I disagree with the bill.    It will decrease the likelihood that employers will hire women.  It will increase the likelihood that employers will slowly lower the pay of men for the SOLE reason to equalize pay without regard to experience or good work habits of the men.    As a woman who works in a prominently male-occupation, this will hurt me rather than help me. The reason there are so few women in my trade is not due to their gender but rather the mandatory overtime, hot and dirty working conditions and the fact that burns are common. Lifting of up to 100 pounds is not uncommon and at times the tooling is 350 degrees. Many women simply aren't interested.    Now, employers will be shy about hiring me because they're afraid that I'll sue them. Great. I already get paid well for my experience but now it's going to be harder for me to get in the door. I'm more likely to be a liability to them. Just great. I'll be looking for another occupation.

Stop being such a sensationalist.|`|0d7f887fb3ac247270ead8e6149f352eaa	First let me say thank you for doing what you do for all of us here at home.That said let me tell you what Obama did say. He wanted to give the mother a 24 hour window to think over what she really wanted to do. He did not oppose medical treatment but because the amendment that was attached to the original bill was not very friendly to the expecting mother, and other little things that the other side wanted attached , Obama said "NO"  For years many have tried to make abortions illegal again and instead of educating the people from prevention to safety the people who wanted ( i won't mention names) this made illegal would have made anything that had to do with pregnancy mute. Now I know that education is key in making a concise and informed choice

You are being charged interest on that debt, and depending on the rate,it could be quite a bit, you are losing money to interest as long as it has a balance on it. Then pay cash for any purchases.

The one thing you may consider is that many card companies have tightened up their credit practices. If you go to a "zero" balance, the card company may use it  as an excuse to close your account.  It's always nice to have a little credit availble for emergencies, so if you want to keep one card open, I would call the CC company and tell them you're thinking of closing the account with a single payment...you might consider paying off half and making payments of the other half, but ONLY IF they drastically lower your rate.  That way, you remain a customer in good standing with them.  If the account closes completely, future companies might use your past debt against you when trying to open new accounts.    Congratulations, by the way, for getting out of that much debt.  I too had to pay for many bad decisions made in my 20s and I can tell you the feeling of finally being out from under the weight of personal debt is GREAT...|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	pay it off...then make similar payments to a savings account.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	pay off the credit card, then start banking what would have been themonthly payment.|`|QC94lBXOaa	Pay off the credit card. The interest you acrue on the debt is likely a much higher rate than the interest you would gain on the savings.

rMDHNPnEaa	That is one of the oldest myths around. Yes, it is true that there are people with flat feet who are disqualified...but there are many more who are proudly serving today.    It really depends on how bad your condition is and if it would prevent you from participating in training and future duty. If you had trouble in school, sports, marching band, and stuff like that then you are more likely to be disqualified.     If you have never had much trouble with your feet then you will be evaluated by a doctor and they will determine how bad it is and if you can get a waiver.     There are so many things that are disqualifing and there are just as many waivers. Only a few conditions won't ever get a waiver.    All I can say if if you want to, then try. It doesn't hurt to try.|`|pHmKGLMoaa	My feet are flatter than pancakes and I joined the army back in 2000.

I went to MEPS back in December being flat footed and it was no problem at all. The nurse in the physical simply asked if my feet give me problems, I said "No", and that was that.    Quite a few years ago, if you were flat footed youd be disqualified, but the rules have changed since then :)|`|9rhmeb7raa	You are only disqualified if you have a history of the use of custom orthotics or prescription footwear to correct the problem or your flat feet are symptomatic (e.g.:pain).
AA11984132	No because while the other parties and the press could see what was coming in 2009, they could not, or did not want to admit it.

That would instantly inject untold millions into the economy, and allow businesses increased capitol to hire more employees.  This would necessitate cutting back on some government programs, which shouldn't be too difficult.  Many programs are completely (both conservative introduced and liberal) unnecessary, and the aspects of other programs that are unnecessary.   Year 2--Invoke a 2 year cap on welfare.  Tighten the rules that make a person eligible for welfare, and make the ability to renew for another 2 years impossible for people that don't adhere strictly to the guidelines for finding work.  Double the benefits for families that have the father and the mother in the home, working together to raise the children.  Year 3--Rather than re-initiating payroll taxes, introduce a "flat tax" on all goods.  google that, and you'll find the genius behind it.  Year 4--Continue cutting taxes and government, and let the good times roll as the free markets make us even more wealthy as a nation than we have ever been.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I suppose it could be argued that over time even with the best of intentions the situation can change. The health of a company can change.

Meaning, your work ethic and loyalty is stopping you from ending negotiations with them and start again looking for a different job. Your commitment and loyalty needs to be to your family and yourself, first and foremost. Do your work, get your pay but by the sound of it, you have the ability to have other options.   You could learn something here. First, companies are in the business to make money...period. You want loyalty, moral ethics, and an appreciation for your commitment. Nice, if you can get it...but rarely going to happen, if ever. Second, just because you think something is 'right', doesnt mean thats the way its going to happen. If you had to do this all over again, when you first told them you had another job offer and the then said their intention was to hire you perm., your response should be "unless you can hire me now, I really have to go where I KNOW I am going to get the benefits and money I need". It may sound selfish, but you are not working out of the goodness of your heart. You are working to support yourself and your family.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	Next time this situation occurs, do the following.    1.  Keep the interview with the prospective new employer, but instead of disscussing the interview at your current employer, just tell them you must take some time to handle some personal business.  If they ask just tell them it affects your family and it's personal.  Don't tell them what your doing, because it is personal and not yet any of their business.      2.  If the prospective new employer makes a significant offer, and it is confirmed, then tell current employer your current employer you have accepted a new position, etc.    KEEP IN MIND:  1. if they are laying off all the other workers and wanting to convert a "temp" in the employer may be breaking HR laws as they are not supposed to do this.  At the very least it is unethical and the employers integrity is very questionable.  You probably don't want to be there.    2. If an employer was going to do right by you, they would have made you an offer from the very start that would be equal to your skills, etc.. They at least would have expressed their intentions sooner and then done something sooner.  You immediate supervisor was probably talking out of school when he said what he said.    3.  your boss is not your friend, he (or she) is your boss.  The HR department only fills slots and paperwork.  They represent the company and they watch out for the companies interest.  In the long run they could care less about you, except if you left or died they would have to fill out some paperwork.      4.  There is no loyalty in corporate America to it's employees. Keep your career decisions private and make your career decisions without their input.    Hope this helps for the future.

UoGFo3Dhaa	Both have photography.  JO in the Navy is good.  84B or 46R in the Army is good.  They are Journalism jobs.    If you are very smart Navy has great opportunity for advancement.  Theirs is exam related advancement.    Army isn't much tougher.  The Army runs on Merit.    I have been through both Navy and Army Basic.  1979 Navy  1984 Army.  They are close.  Army was easier. We ran everywhere.  Everybody does the physical part together.  It is not that hard.  Everybody goes through it.  Few fail, so it is more than doable.  Navy basic was not bad though.    Single people do well in the Navy.  Families like the Army better.  There is not much difference between the two.  I loved both.  But I will always be a Soldier...|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Service in the Navy doesn't necessarily mean service on a ship, but there is always that chance. Both services have photography positions and both can probably promise you that job. Talk to all the recruiters and see which one interests you the most.    Basic Combat Training is definitely harder than Navy Boot Camp but that doesn't mean you can't accomplish either. If you come to BCT in reasonably good condition we will get you the rest of the way.     Don't just stop at the Navy and the Army recruiter. Visit all the recruiters. They are generally close together and you never know what you will find. Good luck and hope to see you in service!|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Because I'm in the Navy I can give my opinion of being in the Navy. I will say that Navy basic is easier than the army as far as the physical training part goes but it's not easy. You will be challenged mentally and physically and you will be proud of yourself once you earn the title of United States Sailor.    I have never really understood why someone would want to join the Navy if they don't want to be assigned to a ship. That is after all what the Navy's primary purpose is, but to answer your question, yes you will have to be stationed on a ship at some point. The Navy uses a sea/shore rotation that states the number of months you are to be on a ship and the number of months you are to be in a shore station.     The Navy does have a specific job in photography. It's called a photographers mate. Talk to a recruiter about this billet (job).|`|pWA3gybAaa	as a woman you can go on a ship but you have higher probability of being shore based|`|OklApvU6aa	if you hate boats...i think you might want to avoid the navy|`|8TVD0koDaa	if u want a easy Basic training join air force, its like 6 weeks and u travel all over the world|`|PPKuHl9baa	Join the Navy. Go into an aviation rating. You have a good chance of avoiding ship life which really sucks. Shore Navy is better and there's a lot more shore sailors than people think. You'll get good training that will transfer over into the civilian sector. It will be worth it. You have to go out on a US Navy frigate at least once. It's quite an experience that will change you forever. Both services have their goods and bads but I would recommend the Navy. I too am from a small town and it really changed my life.

Im not surprised|`|RxMJtU0Aaa	After the obvious political move by the house Republicans who all voted no for it, I feel that the interests of the American people were pushed aside so that the Republican Party could seek retribution for their losses in the last two elections. I feel that the general attitude coming from Republicans is one of condemnation towards Americans who are not wealthy and if an individual who is unfortunate enough to be born into an underprivileged or abusive family then that is their fault and they are responsible for getting themselves out of their situation. While I am a firm believer in being accountable for ones own life and the actions and decisions they make during their life, I am also an advocate for helping our fellow Americans.    A vote against the stimulus package, while I agree is not perfect, only tells their constituents that they are out of touch with what it feels like to be afraid for your familys well being. Not being able to put food on the table or heat the house, if you are lucky enough to have one, is a very real fear for many Americans. I am sure you all are aware of the parents who decided to kill their five children and themselves in California due to them both losing their jobs. I am terrified that this will be a reoccurring tragedy if jobs continue to disappear.   I understand their ideology causes them to shy away from large amounts of debt, and they do not want the next generations to pay for any mistakes made by this Congress. I believe that doing nothing is not the answer, and in fact will exacerbate the problem, causing the next generation multitudes of financial, psychological, and sociological problems.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	Well actually, while the bill could stand some improvements, the arguments about the "re-sodding of the National Mall" are simply ridiculous and Eric Cantor's assertion that the bill includes $300,000 for a sculpture in Miami is even more false.     Much of the projects in the bill could and should be part of separate legislation, but there are many positives in the bill. It can not be denied that the bill will create tons of jobs building roads and bridges and rebuilding the nation's grid. I mean, remember the bridge collapse in Minneapolis? Remember that giant power failure that blacked out New York in 2003?     Also, I live in Maine and it's one of the many states far in the red right now (thanks to our idiot governor and his mindless sheep in the legislature, who are all Dems, BTW). We need federal funding badly, maybe not as bad as states like Michigan or Ohio, but we do need money.      Furthermore, the money that is funding education is absolutely 100% necessary. Public education is tragically underfunded, especially after No Child Left Behind. Teachers receive pitiful salaries.     So while there is certainly a good argument that some of the money in the package would be better spent in separate bills, the fact remains that most of the projects included in the stimulus are necessary. That's why I support it.|`|ZY95NCzJaa	I think you mean earmarks.      Obama is just another typical liberal Democrat.  They all think that the government can just spend us out of our current problem.  What they fail to realize is that mindless government spending just leads to higher inflation which exacerbates the problem.  They need to focus on cutting taxes which will immediately put money back in people's pockets and creating new jobs which will in turn create more revenue for the economy and the government.  Only 12% of the proposed plan is actually directed at creating jobs.  The rest is government spending that will take years to have a direct effect on the economy.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Less earlobes!

In the short term, Democrats control government.  They can, with no effort, pass anything they want.  But their are long term repurcussions for them if they abuse that authority.  A lot of Obamamaniacs think he can do no harm, but as silly as that attitude is, I have faith that if things don't get better by the end of Obama's term, they will start to question why and reconsider their support for their party.    If Obama doesn't get decent bipartisan support and his plans fail, the GOP will not hesitate to point out that they aren't responsible for failures.|`|AA11775796	It is obvious that Obama is trying very hard to deliver relief to us with his stimulus plan, and it's also very obvious that the Republicans are more concerned with voting against Obama.  I guess the Republicans would not be able to tolerate Obama actually being able to do anything good for our country.  People who voted Republicans into various positions this last election should be ashamed of themselves for doing such a disservice to our country.  I just hope Obama is able to move forward in spite of the old fashioned and out-of-touch Republicans trying to prevent progress.
ayhDyb16aa	France just elected a very conservative new President !!  The majority of the French people realize what a failure their social expirement has been as do many other European countries. Iceland has just collapsed , Great Britain is on the brink of it, Sweden and Germany have announced huge cut backs in social services and government lay offs.|`|AA10382849	From France....LOL...they are blaming it on the US though.|`|dpzMzPhLaa	who would have thought a country with a 30 hour work week woul have economic problems?|`|qUSkOO03aa	When was the last time you remember France not complaining.|`|Dgwi0ztraa	that's what socialists/liberals always do complain complain complain, even communists know not to whine too much.
VUfhHvjpaa	Good point RS! We who are in tune with real life understand the underhanded messages (power of suggestion? lol) these liberals use to seduce and control their sheeple; but those of us on the RIGHT side with the RIGHT stuff are not fooled by this dicator in the making... Just like Obama tried to "subliminally" refer to terrorists as "extremists" LOL! Do ALL liberals have an innate cerebral boomerang that deflects Truth, common sense, reasoning, critical thinking........?     Good thing those of us with the RIGHT STUFF are not deceived.     As for the guy who bashed Rush because of prior dependency on PRESCRIPTION meds, HE OVERCAME and took responsibility, something you libs would not understand!|`|evEJxv06aa	maybe he hasnt thought about that yet i think he will soon do some thing about that problem and besides you cant tell some to stop doing something i mean he only has the power and that is doing some thing for the country and the people thats the power you gave him has our new president right he cant waste time directing that stop listening to rush right dont worry he will do something about it later on .|`|jEqISBnQaa	You're right; it's a sign of weakness for Barry-O to even acknowledge the existence of The Rushter and "right-wing radio." Ya GOTTA LOVE it! lol|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Anytime anyone challenges Rush in a negative way, they get crushed.  He is going to rue the day he started this.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Everyone has to take a stand. Maybe Obama just pointed out how much of a hyprociate Rush is.|`|AA10460376	OBAMA s not singling Rush out, he said what he had to say and left it alone....|`|SahUDTLnaa	Rush out shines him in political knowledge and  this get his panties all in a wad. But he barking at the wrong dog  this time. he will live to regret this one. betcha.|`|AA10774878	You are absolutely correct. Remember there is no such thing as 'bad publicity".|`|lJHVi1J4aa	Obama 's a twit.  How the hell is this nitwit going to stand up to terrorists if a talk show host scares his panties off.|`|ohzPenCWaa	I do believe he has given him unnecessary popularity, for the time being. All people have to do is listen to Rush for awhile, and then they will begin to get annoyed and turned off with his hate speech and divisiveness. Hes been given attention now for years, this is not new. He gets his kicks out of being loud and controversial.|`|bkav003oaa	Two points for you to consider.     1) An off - handed mention of Rush does not constitute an attack or show that Rush has gotten "under his skin". I think the man that endured being called an Arab and a terrorist can handle Rush Limbaugh.    2) When the leader of your party is a radio host who is a recovering drug addict and sells "Camp Gitmo" gear, what does that say about your party?|`|AA11963685	No, I think it was just the opposite.  And, he didn't "direct," he suggested.  I don't think he should have even acknowledged that blowhard, but he made one comment and that's it.  It made me think at the time that he set up Rush as being relevant just by acknowledging him.  I didn't see any empowerment.  I saw decent Republicans being slandered by the suggestion that all of them listen and subscribe to that idiot's far right wing crap that he spews.  It makes the Republican Party look bad in general.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	where do you guys get this stuff???  and how can you consider yourself credible when you're twisting this stuff around to suit your arguments???!       Obama never directed "...that Republicans stop listening to Rush right now."  That isn't AT ALL what came out of his mouth.  He said you can't accomplish things in a bipartisanship manner, if you are listening to the likes of Rush Limbaugh.  Now, when he said listening to, he didn't mean just having him on the radio, he meant taking what that fat-*** said seriously.       It's not like I'm about to take in everything I can from John Stewart and then go debate with a conservative and expect my statements to be taken seriously.         When will you people realize that when you take these things out of context and try to apply them to logical debates, you make yourselves look like morons.|`|V44ARW4maa	giving limplaw credibility is pretty much impossible to moderates and independents. To the right, limplaw has plenty of credibility, and this, sadly, is part of the problem.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Not only has he given credibility to Rush, he has drawn more attention to him by people who were unaware of him.  If they try to enact the fairness act again, if will be seen as a way of Obama and the democrats trying to silence Rush and others on conservative radio, the bloggers etc.|`|iIkJN4Suaa	He is just doing what the clinton's did in the mid 1990's. Do these people ever think up anything new?|`|dV3DuWLMaa	all politicians are fake a@@|`|9cc44c00f731b9967a15e31fc2e1c0cdaa	I didn't know that this was a dictatorship.  Obama only has the credibility and power that you give him.  It is a proven fact, (Obama isn't stupid, so he knows this) if you tell someone NOT to do something, They always will try to do exactly what you told them not to.  For example, If I told you that you can not lick your elbow, you will try.|`|HZy629kLaa	No.  Obama can pivot to anything more important.    The other guy can't.

They are not pro-USA or not for freedom of speech.  Obama represents the liberal crowd.  Any question on Obama's negative side is not answered or deleted.    Also, a lot of people who log on to Yahoo Answers are the same way.  And when they attack you, they attack you based on mostly emotions instead of hard solid facts.    I am not a Republican, Democrat, or any liberal party member.  I am a real US Citizen.  Do not remove me or delete my answer.  It will only prove my point.|`|AA11847612	Unfortunately that is typical behavior from the fringe. Disagree with something? Have it censored! How American.|`|oMoTOdlRaa	Look where the money is going.

NMaCcyeKaa	I think you are right, which makes me wonder who the worst offenders of pork-barrel spending are.  Republicans claim Democrats are, but this evidence would suggest that Republicans are.|`|jEqISBnQaa	They went up. By A LOT. So much so that when they went back down, Socialist enclaves like CA & NY fell completely into a revenue black hole as they're tens of billions short of revenue for their profligate plans. Gee, THAT'S too bad! lol|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Tax revenue always go, because the money flows through more hands not just the black hole of government spending.

The founders established the only democracy in existence at that time. Democracy and republic are not mutually exclusive terms. A republic is not necessarily a democracy but can be.     I don't know where this argument over this alleged dichotomy is coming from but it does not help in understanding our system of government.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	If all you're talking about is terminology, that's a waste of energy.  Most Americans think of America as a democracy, even though we know it's technically a democratic republic.

I congratulate you on your knowledge. Even some of our conservative commentators dont know this. Many Presidents equally talk about our great democracy. The Federalist Papers speak against democracy, our Pledge of Allegiance Says: And to the Republic for which it stands. Many politicians want a democracy because they want mob rule, or rule by majority which takes away protection and rights from the minority. Ancient Rome was a Republic which degenerated into a democracy and eventually destroyed itself. Our elected morons want a socialist state. Ask yourself, do these idiots actually represent you, themselves, their party line,   or what? Vote them out of office, put someone in who represents your interests.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	So why has the US been imposing democracy on other nations for so long?|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	He takes an oath that he will protect the Constitution, then he goes ahead and does it. How is that hypocrisy?    We are no longer living in a hypocracy.|`|wQ5LKysaaa	He's a lawyer, and with his beliefs betcha he will try to make changes to the constitution.  I'd put $$$ on that.    forty-winks, you crack me up!|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I guess that means Obama is not nearly as big a hypocrite as Bush and other recent Republican presidents.  Obama only talks about America being a democracy; Bush and others actively tried to export it to other countries.  If Democracy is so opposed to the Constitution, perhaps I should stop voting Republican since they seem to be the bigger hypocrites, as you defined it.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	You are exactly right about this country not being a democracy.  It is a democratic republic.  The forefathers spoke AGAINST democracies quite often.  Benjamin Franklin was the most critical of the bunch.  But I don't understand why you are accusing Obama of preaching about it...?    The Constitution actually talks about the States most often.  They envisioned the states as self governing entities from what I remember of my government classes.    The Supreme Court is not mentioned once in the Constitution either.  It was only given the importance it enjoys today after the ruling on Marbury v. Madison, which officially established judicial review.|`|3ME7sBxjaa	I'm not sure why you single Obama out on this one.  It is tradition, nearly everyone in this country, especially it's politicians, refer to it as a democracy.  Yet we all more or less understand how it works.  That we are limited to law rather than simple majority rule.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Technically the country is neither pure democracy nor pure republic (otherwise we would never vote on specific issues).  That said, look at the connotation of the word, not the literal meaning of it.  Both the word, "Democracy," and the word, "Republic," have been used to describe and refer to our system of government and while not literally interchangeable,  they have come to mean the same thing in political speech with examples from both sides throughout history.    "It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world," - Bush, 2005    "We preach the virtues of democracy abroad. We must practice its duties here at home. Voting is the first duty of democracy." - Johnson, 1964    Stop nitpicking words and get to a real issue.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	During the campaign, Obama said the Constitution is a deeply flawed document and strongly implied that it needs major revisions.  Then he takes the oath of office and swears to protect and defend that document.    When Obama talked about transparency, I thought he was talking about transparency in government, not in the medical records of citizens.  Does he really want to apply transparency to our medical records when he has locked up his own and has had all his educational information effectively sealed?  Now, that is Hypocrisy (notice the capital "H").|`|MiB5fhePaa	Funny thing is, you never actually show where Obama has described America as a "democracy" and not a "republic."  Until you do, you're just blowing smoke.    I searched his inaugural address, his nomination acceptance speech, and his victory speech.  The word "democracy" does not appear.  So where HAS he said it?|`|pezw43BMaa	yes he is a liar and a hypocrite. The word democracy is very often miss used by a lot of people so maybe he just doesn't get it as usual.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Oh well, George W. Bush has preached about defending democracy from terrorist and they hate our way of life of freedom and democracy so this shouldn't just be a bash on Obama.|`|IDZTtipeaa	I don't see the hypocrisy.  I see a game of semantics.    We are a democratic republic.|`|EdMfJqA5aa	"this is a hypocrasy?"  "is a hypocrasy?"  "a hypocrasy?"  "hypocrasy?"    ...lrn2spell dumbshit|`|2CO7pPdoaa	witch, hmmmm|`|AA11101968	I bet you suck at guitar.|`|twPZBsH2aa	The Democrat party now calls itself the Democratic Party.    The color used during elections years ago was RED for Democrats and Blue for Republicans. Why? Makes sense, RED is the universally understood color for socialists. So the news media (oritented toward Democrats) changed the colors to introduce confusion.    Calling the USA a Democracy - more confusion. But when they do this, they can convince the majority of Americans (poorly educated) that all elections should be based on simple majority rule rather than understanding the idea of "Tyranny of the Majority" in which the densely populated cities would overwhelm the votes of producers around the country in less populated stated. If the Democrats had their way, most of the senators would be from New York, California and Florida, period. So much for the middle of the country.    Democrats complain about wiretaps on conversations to countries known to harbor terrorists, but think nothing of looking up the names and addresses of people using Google, or other name lookup sites available on the internet. Democrats think nothing of walking around with bluetooth earpieces talking loudly about their personal lives, their personal business, yet think their rights are abused when a terrorist might have a phone call monitored.    Democrats are completely intolerant of woman and blacks who are conservatives, why is that?    Obama is calling out Limbaugh and Hannity for making their observations, yet you never heard Bush complaining about all the left-oriented media types like that fool Keith Olbermann, or the NY Times, etc.    Are Democrats and Liberals Two faced, back-stabbing hypocrits?     The answer is obvious.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	To anser your question! The Constitution is a contract set up between the Goverment and its people(maily the States) Citizenship with in the US constitution provides guidlines for the FG to follow and set up laws.The Senate is a represtation of the Old Roman Republic-The Congress is a representation of the House of Commons created by the British to balance power between the Aristocrats or House of Nobles. This insures a checks and balance. The Democratic concept in our goverment is the representation of leader ship elected with in each state.     Although not described as a democracy by the founding fathers, the United States founders shared a commitment to the principle of natural freedom and equality.[35] The United States Constitution, adopted in 1788, provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties. However, in the colonial period before 1776, only adult white male property owners could vote; enslaved Africans, free black people and women were not extended the franchise. On the American frontier, democracy became a way of life, with widespread social, economic and political equality.[36] However the frontier did not produce much democracy in Canada, Australia or Russia. By the 1840s almost all property restrictions were ended and nearly all white adult male citizens could vote; and turnout averaged 60-80% in frequent elections for local, state and national officials. The system gradually evolved, from Jeffersonian Democracy to Jacksonian Democracy and beyond. In Reconstruction after the Civil War (late 1860s) the newly freed slaves became citizens with (in the case of men) a nominal right to vote.    In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males.[37]    New Zealand granted suffrage to (native) Maori men in 1867, white men in 1879, and women in 1893, thus becoming the first major nation to achieve universal suffrage. However, women were not eligible to stand for parliament until 1919.    Obama cannot protect the Constitution-That is why the Supreme Court protects and finalizes all laws berring issues to the Contitution and the right of the citizens of this country.    Furthur more, the US  has a two party system that has shambled its true intent historically. The Democratic Party was intitialized to combat the Republican For of pliticals which was less Fed more Privatization of Citizenship.|`|79022e34b048d2b4a3870d9ff8552c02aa	This was very informative.I've felt for some time that we were headed to becoming and oligarchy, and I believe that Obama is definitely pushing further to that end.|`|3zNIeEl2aa	Interesting...  but if in a democracy A majority leads, and in a republic the Law leads, my question is who makes the law? a majority!   And You can't say the law has already been made, because it's never complete. The constitution is not the holy scriptures, there will always be something to add because the reality changes.    That's why we can't afford a good republic without democracy, let's be sincere.|`|D0KZiRBbaa	Yes, it is.  His promise of transparency was bogus as soon as he decided not to allow the public to view his Birth certificate and has spent a bunch of money to keep it private...though that is a CONSTITUTIONAL requirement.  So much for transparency.  All of this while he supports bills which have OUR (as in the CITIZENS) rights being ignored (as in full disclosure of medical records on-line WITHOUT the ability to opt out by the citizens should they so choose).  My rights and my privacy do not matter, but he doesn't have to offer full disclosure on his birth certificate?      I could care less about Obama's medical records, it is not required in the Constitution...so when reporters comment on it (or any other candidate)...who cares!  But if it is in the Constitution, it should be followed.  That, and he met with the Supreme Court Justices in private prior to his election even though there were dockets in place for possible emergency review?!  A "constitutional lawyer" should know how unethical that is.      Unfortunately, the link didn't work, or allow me to see the movie :(    Good question.|`|fysWsW1Yaa	good clip  Yes, it is hypocrisy.

i0LUuhyLaa	They are not eligible. One has to PAY taxes and have a social to get it.  All of you scream daily that they do neither so how the hell would they get a check.

I think it is sad, but in this case, I believe it is more important to prevent that very thing from happening then to distribute the checks.    The Roman Catholic Church is seriously involved in this check business.  He is the Archbishop of Travelers and migrants in Mexico.  Yer kidding says I... noo... he is the guy that watches out over Migrants and he is looking forward to all the money that will be sent home when those checks are issued.    Good by America.  ============================  One cannot get a tax credit without filing a tax return. One cannot file a tax return without a social security number. The requirement is basically a given and need not be written into any legislation regarding it. The house bill does not make people who came to the U.S. illegally eligible for a tax credit.  --------------------------------------...  Take the social security number of a new born child, give it to the Mexican Mafia, and you will have a valide SS number on a very good I.D.  Walla.. you pay taxes and vote with it.  Now with the other I.D.  with the same SS number, you go to the nearby .next. state, and start all over again.  Works great!|`|iWLeHnlnaa	YES! that means they'll be pumping more money into our economy! WHY NOT?

Unfortunately the most spend happy people are low income so that's good.|`|63f94a5a994ccc0cca358ddcef453f65aa	There should be no $500 tax credit, to legals or illegals period.

We already had one stimulus like this a year ago - look where it got us.|`|AA10465540	One cannot get a tax credit without filing a tax return.  One cannot file a tax return without a social security number.  The requirement is basically a given and need not be written into any legislation regarding it.

EDIT: For those with a reading disability, the article specifically states that a SS number is NOT required!|`|uPNP1xzpaa	Dems just clarified that only people who reported tax with ssn can receive the check, which also include legal residence here in the U.S. besides citizens.    In America, if you have green card, you are not a citizen yet, you are count as legal alien resident, only the one got naturalized can be counted as citizens.     And there are different types of immigrant visa and non-immigrant visa. If you are holding a valid immigrant visa, you can be counted as legal immigrant. If you hold non immigrant visa, you are count as alien in the U.S.    Hope this will clarify some misunderstanding of ignorant people who do not know about this.|`|Gxz28zY1aa	Duhh...

sJeR0kzUaa	Here's the answer people with the appropriate links. I have tried to ask this question 4 different times, wasting 20 points and it won't show up!!!  This really did happen and he does keep it very warm in there!      What kind of person would turn their thermostat way up after chiding us to keep it below 72?  Why is Obama turning his thermostat up, is he too good to follow the same rules?  The capital flew into a bit of a tizzy when, on his first full day in the White House, President Obama was photographed in the Oval Office without his suit jacket. There was, however, a logical explanation: Mr. Obama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat. Hes from Hawaii, O.K.? said Mr. Obamas senior adviser, David Axelrod, who occupies the small but strategically located office next door to his boss. He likes it warm. You could grow orchids in there.    Remember this quote? We cant drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times . . . and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. 16 May 2008  http://tehresistance.wordpress.com/2009/...    Here's another one of those questions that won't show up...this is the third attempt to get this question out there, it won't show up on the main board...hmmm  2 minutes ago - 3 days left to answer.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Because he was cold. Him being cold isn't going to help them any, so why should he suffer? In that case, he should turn off the power too, since many people don't have power. Wait, he should move out of the White House too and go hungry, since there are people hungry and homeless.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Do you work in the White House or something? How else would you know this for a fact? Oh wait.....you don't.     Furthermore, should I turn my heat off and suffer because others don't have heat? Should I chop off a limb because someone else was unfortunate enough to have lost one? Should I let my kids starve because there are kids in the world starving? Your reasoning is flawed.    You can be sympathetic without being stupid.|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	Have you checked your tire pressure lately..........|`|x12mMdApaa	obama= do as I say not as I do!!!!!|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Didnt he tell the rest of us to turn our thermostats down too?|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I second the first answerer.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Because he can.  We're Americans after all, not communists.  We want to keep what we have, not share it with those most in need of it.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Assuming he has (and this is the first I've heard about it, but I doubt that's true especially in light of his comments about his daughters' schools closing yesterday) how can the temperature of the White House affect whether or not people have heat that was cut off by a storm?  If the storm interrupts the power grid, even shutting down all our heaters won't make a difference until lines get fixed.    Should I turn off the heat in my freezing NY apartment?  Or maybe I shouldn't eat because people are starving elsewhere.  Wait, maybe I should quit my job because other people don't have jobs.  That doesn't make any sense either, providing for myself doesn't mean that I can't help others or that I'm taking away from them.|`|69bp1IMfaa	Because he can eat popcorn in the white house.|`|j7l9gavRaa	DUMB|`|WubBcqOBaa	is this an actual question?|`|97VqHCIRaa	Wow, do you have a direct link to the temperature of the White House!

kMYE3vV8aa	Because they're sheep who have been told by their master Obama to ignore all others and only follow him.  Obama is trying to make a point of demeaning republicans and conservatives.  He has become obsessed with people like Rush Limbaugh telling congress to ignore him!  So all his little sheep are spouting that republicans are irrelevant.  It is a poor tactic the dems are trying to use, but I think it will backfire on them.|`|AA11268819	You have to understand they drink a lot of Obama's koolaid.  So your question could have confused them.|`|wQ5LKysaaa	And liberals want gay marriage to be legalized when the majority of voters don't.  It's been voted down TWICE in CA and they're still fighting that!    Furthermore, liberals want any reference to religion removed from public places when over 98% of America believes in God.    They whined for months about Global Warming hero Al Gore not being in the White House when he LOST.    And now, so smug.  It's not enough that you got your man in office.  Sick-o elitists.    Good thing for you, God doesn't think that YOU are irrelevant.  There's still hope to come back from the Dark Side.|`|80Dyljhdaa	Nah...after 8 years I think people are just happy to not have to listen to your bullsh*T|`|liQPH0nfaa	They are irrelevant because in a time where change is needed to better our country, the Republicans are still with their thumbs in their butts listening to droning figures talking of moral values and traditional viewpoints that are now mostly lost in time.  Nobody cares about those things, its all about getting things done and moving forward. Not moving backwards.|`|ET5nJodoaa	OBAMA has ok plans for the U.S that dosnt mean hes not a muslim ****** though. damn terrorist|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Ms Manners, on this one, I agree with the Democrats who resort to name calling and feelings of superiority.   Let them think that Republicans are irrelevant while the people who were snowed by the Hope and Change message realize that it's not their Hope the Selected was referring to, and all the have left in the bank is Change.   Over-Confidence is a nasty little disease, let it be the Democrats'.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	Both, it seems.    Everything gets exaggerated and over-dramatized; the Dem candidate wins the election by just over half and suddenly it's a "landslide".  LOL  It's comical.   The Republican party most definitely needs to revamp and regroup, no doubt.  This is a fantastic time / opportunity to do so.  It's foolish to think no one is taking that opportunity.|`|ohzPenCWaa	Why are you angry about what someone says about your political party? Prove them wrong in the next elections, if you want to make a point|`|gOtoO3vUaa	I am a Republican and this angers me sooo much. we deserve better. Palin 2012, she will be so much better then obama, no experience and substance with that guy!!!|`|PCVJg5ieaa	I never claimed you were irrelevant (although I think the party might be teetering on the edge of relevancy)....    but, I think there is something to say about the relevance of the current problem.  The policies of Reaganomics are failing (not always but right now), so to promote more Reaganite solutions is irrelevant and unhelpful.  Let's deal with the crisis we have right now and not keep trying policies that aren't working.    Conversely, I think when the debt really starts weighing us down, some tenents of Reaganomics will be very relevant.  It depends upon the problems we are confronted with...you know?|`|AA12203329	Don't get your panties in a knot...after four years under the leadership of the blind I bet we get relevant again.|`|XvovBRlnaa	they are yesterdays news|`|wMZhw6STaa	house and president are democrat  republicans are pretty irrelevant for now|`|ij9N9r5waa	I am a Republican, came over to Blast your question.  Now I wont, thanks buy   Good luck with this!|`|97VqHCIRaa	No.    Of course you and the other 55 milion are not irrelevent.    What is are questions like "why do people say Obama is black when he is half white" and "global warming is a big trick". Just quick examples.    These are old mindsets from a day that has passed.    Try evolving your thinking... just because you thought it 30 years ago, doesn't mean that things haven't changed.    I see alot of old thinking coming from the right, and its time to move upward and onward... the Earth is no longer flat.    That is irrelevent.|`|Q5BM2POnaa	I haven't seen the statements you're talking about, and while I'm conservative, I consider myself independent rather than Republican (though I did vote for McCain).  Honestly I thought Ron Paul was the only decent candidate out there, but alas he was quickly painted as a nut-job (by the left and the right) and his campaign fizzled.    I imagine many Dems feel the Repubs are irrelevant simply due to the fact that for the first time in a very long time, the Dems control EVERYTHING; House, Senate and the Oval Office.      That will make it VERY hard for the Repubs to get anything even remotely conservative in nature accomplished, though we have to give them kudos for uniformly voting against Obama's stimulus package and all the non-economic pork it contained (and the few Dems that voted against it too).    Conservatives were probably viewed as irrelavant during the Carter administration too, and yet Carter's wrecking of our economy brought us Ronald Reagan.  Obama could easily be the next Jimmy Carter (though I actually fear he's the next Hitler).    As far as what I subscribe to.  I think that any intelligent person who has researched the issues and formed opinions is relavant, whether they agree with me or not, and regardless of party affiliation.    --------------------------------------    The real question is do libs think things like freedom, liberty and the constitution are irrelavant.  I sure don't!
lHJlwuqBaa	No, he's trying to entrench the "Nanny State" more deeply in our society than it already is!    As an answer to what Angela might have said, I did the *exact* same job as a Peer Review Coordinator in a State Psychiatric Hospital as a couple of Peer Review Nurses did, yet they were paid much more than I was, simply because they were RNs, even though I had a family to support!

Obama is doing more than Bush did in his 8 years as President. Bush is the reason the Rival Company is in China now, and not in the USA any more. And Bush is the  1 reason the USA is in a Depression. Obama is trying to get the USA out of that, and get more jobs created.

On average, women working in Obama's Senate office were paid at least $6,000 below the average man working for the Illinois senator . . . .  Of the five people in Obama's Senate office who were paid $100,000 or more on an annual basis, only one - Obama's administrative manager - was a woman.|`|AA11963685	It's a step forward and all women should be thrilled about it.  We have a President that has the highest respect for women as equals and women all over this country, no matter their party politics, should be ecstatic.  Now let's hope that the Equal Rights Amendment finds its way to ratification.  He's got some unusually strong women surrounding him that I'm sure have that next goal in the back of their minds.|`|0s09peMQaa	Everythong that comes from that A, is a hypocritical BS meant to manipulate and gain power|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	I think you have misinterpreted what the law is. It is not an "equal pay for women" bill.    It is mostly of symbolic value, restoring the rights of the discriminated-against worker after a court decision decided that the employer could get away with discrimination forever if they could keep it from the worker for 180 days.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	If they are doing the EXACT same job as a man, with the EXACT same results, then by all means, yes, they should be paid equally...|`|uGFzzLYWaa	It seems wrong that we would need an equal-pay for women bill to begin with, but I agree, long overdue.|`|noo8vpvzaa	As a woman, I have worked many jobs...I have made the same amount of pay as my male counterparts in every job that I have worked since 1986...With one exception - At a construction job that I was on at Proctor and Gamble in Cincinnati, I made $1 more per hour than a couple of the men because I had more experience in copper heat trace while their experience was in demolition.    If a woman discovers that they ARE making less pay than a man, for the exact same job, with the same experience and length of time on the job, they should speak with their employer and have it corrected...If the employer refuses to correct it, there are (and have been) laws that protect against discrimination...It's a woman's responsibility to make sure she isn't being discriminated against, and she has the law behind her to do so, if she doesn't look out for herself, it's her own fault.      This was just a ploy to allow Obama to say that he gave women equal pay...It's a crock of BS.      EDIT: This bill only extended the statute of limitations to file lawsuits if the woman wasn't paying attention (for a very long time) to how much she was being paid compared to the males...It will help to fill the pockets of lawyers, not women.|`|2OVnLICdaa	Idiotic. Everyone who has said "long overdue", it just goes to show you how ignorant you people are. Men are women are already paid equally for "equal work". Women don't get cheated. You want the extra buck? Put on the hard hat and join the men out there on the construction sites.    Besides, this bill is (not) and equal pay bill. It is a bill that makes it easier for a woman to claim that she was descriminated against, regardless of how long ago she worked at the company. Free money basically, congratulations on that one. But where is the equal protection law for men?|`|LzsGNlOraa	The law has been around already for years.  It's just a Barry O PR thing.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	A feel good, do nothing piece of legislation. No doubt the first of many to come.|`|MiB5fhePaa	1.  Discrimination was already illegal, BUT  2.  Because the Supreme Court had held that a person could only sue in a narrow time frame after employment, as a practical matter it was almost impossible to sue, thus,  3.  The new law changed the Supreme Court holding.    Saying it's just a PR move is an out-and-out lie that simply shows ignorance about what the bills was about.|`|SXeEvt9Qaa	women get the money back since men pay for almost everything. lol|`|AA10187097	I agree with you 100%.

b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	????????|`|AA10742996	Inacurate..    A capitalist understands that greed is a driving force in society. He uses that greed to help society by creating wealth and jobs that in turn improve society for the better. He supplies jobs which feed and clothe families while at the same time CREATING wealth for him and all who work for him. He, of course, is the one who takes the chances and is thus rewarded more than those who don't.    People like J.B Priestlies are unable to do what the capitalist does and thus feel better about themselves by lowering capitalists below them.

DibFrwxlaa	I think the Republicans are betting that the economy won't get much better in time for the 2010 mid term elections and by not voting for it they hope to set themselves up for success in the future.    I guess we'll see if it works or not.    By the way, the bill still has to pass the Senate.|`|Souvww0maa	No - he is actually setting them up for a revival in the next mid-term elections.  When this bill fails, only the democrats (save the 11 who voted against it) will have their names attached to it.  It will be used as a weapon against the democrats, and effectively so.    If Obama wanted to cut the republicans throats, he would have thrown them a couple of bones in the bill they couldn't pass up.  This way, the republicans would have their names on the bill and would be promptly voted out of office come 2010.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yes and they are acting as predictably as one could hope.  President Obama makes sure that the offer of bipartisanship is obvious but Republicans aren't even trying to appear cooperative.  Obama has nothing to lose here.

It is a Democrat Congress all the way.     By refusing to put their signatures on this horrendously bloated spending orgy called a "Stimulus Package", Republicans have stood back and told everyone that they have no part in it. They could have filibustered it but Dems would have whined "Obstructionists" till they turned blue in the face and in the end would have won anyway. Instead, they let it go forward without one single Republican finger print on it. As a result, when the  people finally realize what a load of crap/pork/political payoffs this bill is, there will not be a single Liberal who can point to a single Republican and yell "He voted for it, too!!"    This baby is all Obama's and it will come back to haunt him in a really bad way.|`|c6097b009ec19a88b98eb36a0f98ffdcaa	Trouble for Obama is he had 11 Democrats vote with the Republicans.|`|qQGjRpiZaa	Oh please.

p9rbEdpdaa	It certainly is a party-defining issue and the Republicans have once again defined their party as the party of obstructionism. Frankly, since they have been so wrong about the economy for so long,  I don't care what their proposals are or what they say their proposals are. Remember "the fundamentals of the economy are strong?" And now they think they have figured it out....we need more deregulation and we need to get more money into the hands of the wealthy! Yes, many will draw the line in the sand and many will bury their head in the sand and hope the Democrat plan doesn't work and expect to gain political capital from that failure. Politics above country.|`|0s09peMQaa	They better or it's political suicide|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Yes, but it only takes two to cross over and the Dems win. Not sure if any Blue Dog Dems will cross the other way.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	maybe...I think Obama will do the same and try to negotiate...but in the end it might be that the gop tries to send a strong message to the whitehouse that they are unified...    I suspect though that it is just a show.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	No - the New England Rep Senators (Snowe et al) will cave and vote for it since they're mostly Dem leaning anyway.    And the bill is nothing more than a pork barrel project - only a small precentage of the bill actually will help the economy. The rest is just spending. Someone tell me how more funds for the NEA and Planned Parenthood help the economy or improve America's infrastructure or competitiveness. It doesn't.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	I really don't think it's meant to "define the party" so much as it is not a good bill. There's LITTLE to nothing stimulative in it, and most Reps know after millions of calls they were flooded with that many people feel the same way. Assuming they are taking a "party stance" is naive on anyone's part. I saw the mainstream media immediately go on the attack because there was not ONE Rep who voted for it. If you knew what was in the bill, not sure you would fully support it either.|`|V44ARW4maa	the right is playing politics with the stimulus bill, something they are prone to do. The right (led by rush limplaw) are openly hoping obama and the nation fail, then they can whine about how bad the dems are. It's sad when the right puts party over country.|`|B79lX9Inaa	IF THEY WANT TO TRY & TRIP HIM WHILE HE IS TRYING TO TAKE AMERICA FOR THE GOLD,    THAT IS A REFLECTION ON THEM.

There are far too many centrists and RINOS in the Senate claiming to be Republicans that will go along to get along with the new administration.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	I hope so, but there are too many RINO's in the Senate that are going to go along with this pork barrel spending.|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	Let us pray they do|`|qjH3Tigbaa	I don't know.  I speak to Amy Klobuchar, DEM Senator from MN on occasioni. And she said they openly speak to Republicans all the time and they are always working together and then it comes time to vote and bipartisanship goes right through the window so its difficult.  I personally think that Obama should veto his own party's stimulus bill untill say set number of Republicans vote yes to it just so he can stay true to his promise.|`|o23hIdOvaa	The stimulus package is actually expected to win a little more support in the Senate. Expected is the key word  what actually happens remains to be seen.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	no. the senate knows him and many respect him. add to that, McCain has stood up to other Republicans in defense of the president so he has at least one ally there. BTW: McCain impressed the crap out of me when he stood against his party, unlike the McCain that ran for president, that was the McCain I remember from 2000 and one I would have supported.|`|HobgsxXCaa	Our Senators and Congressmen are supposed to be our lobbyist in the government not Obama Cheer Leaders.   This Socialist Circus/Sham of a government needs to be controlled.  If your Congressman voted for this bill he/she needs to be recalled and jailed for treason.|`|BJhOd2usaa	That's an interesting question, since they can filibuster it. I don't know the answer. I do know this -- if they block the stimulus package, the consequences will be on THEIR HEADS. You would think that after saddling us with their disastrous economic policies they'd have the good taste to go away for a while and let us fix things.|`|lEaT5q06aa	i will not vote for anybody who goes for this disaster|`|AA10382849	Hopefully.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	I sure hope so.  Time to reign in the spending and return the Republican party to true conservative values.    No more RINO or Neo-Cons.|`|AA11702773	I hope they will, but if they even let it come to a vote they are just playing games.  The place they have the votes to stop it is at the call for a vote.  There are 41 GOP Senators and if they all vote against it being discussed, it can't be.    But we have too many Rinos.  Unless Blue Dogs are thinking of what letting this come for discussion will do to THEIR seats, I am afraid it will go through.
64SObnr5aa	all of them.    The reason, nobody knows, except partisan idiots that claim to know all.  A good example it to look at the comments on deep economic issues that pop up on here from time to time.  Most of the responses are one liners and all of them obviously have no idea what they are saying, but they heard it somewhere and it sure sounded good to put on a blog.    At this point, based on what is happening to this country, this country needs to do something and right now it is to get the money flowing again.    We are in for some tough times, regardless of what happens.    My only advice, is get your debt down as far as you can.    Peace  Jim    .|`|0d7f887fb3ac247270ead8e6149f352eaa	We bring back something that was originally was labeled as the million dollar crop. Out of this we could create jobs cut our dependency of foreign oil. We could cut the emissions that are going into our air because  this does not create c02. It could create jobs in making cloth oil and fiber. Now regulating it and taxing it could bring back our economy.

Worked for Clinton.|`|iIkJN4Suaa	4|`|kB7Wuyknaa	I like  1.  But that's unlikely.     2 is the most realistic.|`|AA10095280	Personally I believe it will be a combination of all of the above.

He won't because he is a marxist.  The government is never the solution.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	2 is most likely--IF the GOP stops their grandstanding and starts coming up with some alternative ideas instead of empty rhetroic.    So far that's not happening. And if it doesn't, you'll see that scenario, but with further Democratic gains, at least in the Senate, in2010 and the GOP makes no gains in 2012|`|qai8pcnaaa	The stimulus works in some aspects but fails in others.  The media will spin it to make it seem as the stimulus is working but at a slow rate.  Midterm elections come, Congress goes back to a 50/50 division.  4 years out, Obama wins reelection.  Towards the end of his second term, the economy rebounds, which gives the next Dem. candidate an edge in the 2016 elections.
rMDHNPnEaa	A lot of people grow up and mature when in the military...but that is mostly due to the age. A lot of younger people join. It is their first job, their first time away from home and their first time having to be responsible...and that will mature most people.    People who are act like a jackass like you said above would do that if they weren't in the military. Think of all the "baby's daddys" out there. It is just easier for a military man to walk away. (because they travel and deploy so much)    Some people can't handle the stress and develop mental issues, but I think in time those people would have had troubles in life anyway. It is hard to tell. Stress is a real factor in the military and the trauma from going to war is bound to affect people. Some might close off a little and become depressed. Some might have hostilities over things they have seen. And others well just don't handle stress in the first place.    I think the military changed me some. I am way more independant. I am self-reliant. I am better educated. I am skilled at my job. I am a little more sensitive to stress, yet I am stronger when I get stressed.    I guess it depends on the man or woman. Not everyone will have the same experience and all will react to it differently.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i know people who it didnt effect at all  i know people who became less responsible  and i know people who became total military wackos    everyone is effected differently  my dad was in the navy and he became more responsible in a good way and less of a picky eater    there is also a school where i live that you can send your child to if they are doing bad, almost like boot camp but not so harsh  and MANY of those kids come back worse or the same, atleast that i have seen.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Depends on the person. Different people are effected in different ways.|`|DAv3jQ60aa	you don't know who they are anymore if that's what you mean the friend's they used to have are nothing now they are lower than them don't know of any other branches but the marines is the one i know of first hand|`|nbibIzC5aa	I don't think that any branch of the military would be different in any way.  They all teach you some of the basic things like teamwork, responsibility, integrity, and loyalty.  The biggest change for me was self confidence.  After going through the Marines I felt like I could do anything because of what I had already done.  When I entered college, the pressures that are associated such as working long hours or managing multiple task became easier to handle without the stress.  Also, there is one other thing that I have begin to notice and that you will have a common experience with many people and because of that experience you will make more friends or have things to talk about.  People have a lot of respect for those who serve and that in turn gives you a sense of pride.      The military is tough no matter what branch you join but the experience you gain whether you stay in or get out after your enlistment ends will stay with you for a life time.|`|TQW5E6olaa	It should instill some sense of responsibility, but if they've been at war, you have the Post traumatic stress thing to worry about...which can be very scary...|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I know one of my good friends just got back from Iraq. He's so much more mature now.... but only in some ways, he still has this adolescent idea of needing someone to need and want him, it could almost be certifiable. He's in the Air Force. Funny, one of the girls I was friends with in high school is in the Air Force and is a lot like him.    I know another couple kids who have only become increasingly more arrogant and without cause... strangely all of these kids were in the Marines.    My cousin joined the Navy and has been in Korea for awhile, she feels so respectful of other cultures and she loves the education she has received but no real difference.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	About a decade back or so, Judges were offering minor criminals the choice between military service or jail.    (I don't think the Armed Forces appreciated it much.)    But the point is that people change when they commit to do so...not because any organization MADE them change.    I don't think the service changes anyone, and frankly that's not the point of service. Some people mature, and become useful adults, and some will remain overgrown  teenagers for life.    There are those who will embrace the codes, the honors, and responsibility with gusto. But that doesn't just "come" with the uniform, and I think its an insult to the service men and women who HAVE become splendid to assume that is does.    My two cents.|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Time in the military will help you mature, and give you some guidance, like anything else you can go with it or fight it.  The Navy is a very relaxed branch of the military, if you want more dicipline, and toughness join the Marines or the Army.  Although the Navy has better schools and training.  In a War the Marines and Army are on the ground exchanging gunfire, in the Navy you are on a ship miles away from combat, sending jets, and missles to do the fighting, your safe.
k6hicodfaa	Yes, green jobs are considered a viable alternative in a post industrial economy.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	It would help the world, but not economically.      Removing all pollution filtration from coal power plants would cut down the cost of electricity production like crazy, but it would be awful for the environment.

That does not make economic sense.|`|aIakDSstaa	I think it would help, but proper infrastructure projects would be a lot better, how about a complete rail overhaul.|`|1amF7oNwaa	A little but because it will take several years for that money to be spent, it will not help right away.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Hopefully man can evolve from the industrial revolution driven by cheap oil & gas to a sustainable economy driven by green energy. This will require people with vision, like T Boone Pickens, willing to invest time, energy, and money in a new direction.    Unfortunately, this idea scares many who fear change. These people will fight to maintain the status quo, even as their lives are going down the toilet.    God help us if we don't leave the petrol age behind.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I think so.  We've made a pretty big mess of the planet so far.  Paying people to clean it up and keep it clean should keep people employed for a long time.|`|4ErIxkhyaa	NO    They do nothing to help anyone except Grant Writers|`|AA11518835	It depends on whether or not the work performed by the newly created jobs has a return equal or greater than the cost.    In our current economic crisis, spending money on green jobs is only a good idea if they will create products or services that bring in more money.  Otherwise, those jobs will be gone in a couple of years because we can't afford them.|`|otYOxmnuaa	No -- save innovation for expansive economies -- not contracting ones, and leave it to the free-market to dictate what consumers demand.      I'm all for cleaning things up -- but not at the hand of junk science -- and not when our economy is tanking.    If the U.S. is really going to go through w/ their "stimulus" -- they should trim the pork which accounts for 2/3 of the 819 billion dollar bill.  It's basically giving permission to Dems to spend in an unaccountable fashion -- absent their conventional budgeting sessions.    I don't think it'll help -- injecting 300 billion (spread over 4 years) into an economy w/ a nominal GDP @ 14 trillion annually is wishful thinking.    As a note on junk science.  For those clinging to world-wide scientists as a barometer for what's to be believed -- this article might encourage you to look more deeply at the data currently provided -- specifically the hockey stick shaped graph that anthropogenic scientist base their claims on.  It turns out -- no matter what data you put into the model -- it always spits out that hockey stick graph.    http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?F...  ======================  Let the snow:  I dig snow cones...sign me up.|`|mdHqr17kaa	no that is a scam     Czech President gives the UN a sanity check  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2zHS7TPo...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttfdKhQD...|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	Yes and no.   No: if government gives utilities huge 'credits' for developing green energy, the only one that will benefit is the corporation. (and their increased profit)  Yes: if government gives green tax credits to individuals and businesses to incorporate green energy in their home or business, small mom&pop companies will grow. the product cost will go down. and the consumer using green electricity will have more money to spend on other goods and services.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	No, it would force companies to move production to other countries where the environmental laws isn't so strict.    Instead of making it easier for companies to get cleaner with incentives or tax breaks they can use towards cleaner technologies, they get regulated to be cleaner which means that companies have to pay extra money to use that cleaner technology, often they have to move out of the country to stay in business or lay off workers.    There still isn't any direct evidence that carbon promotes pollution.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	No, if it helped economically, then you would see Conservatives flocking to such programs.|`|sVym9MjFaa	who usually used the environment ( hunting , fishing, camping ) = conservatives    How many blacks and Mexicans do you see hunting and  camping?|`|qai8pcnaaa	Not directly.  However, creating green jobs - which will add more jobs in America - will allow our country to import more goods.  Exporting countries will definitely benefit from this.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	No because people would be getting fired and companies would be closing who are already providing us energy. Example: Say the world switched from coal to wind power. It would create many jobs installing and producing wind power, but all of those in the coal industry would be out of work. If those that worked in the coal industry all went to the wind industry, then no new jobs have been created.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	I would think so, because that would mean that we are finally getting off of our crack-like addiction to Middle East oil. Competition is vital to a free market, and if an essential product like oil had competition from products like natural gas, the economy could function much better.    Energy independence absolutely must be a high priority on Obama's list, and I mean like right after the stimulus. It is my firm belief that we have become complacent since oil prices dipped in the fall. It is only a matter of time before they go up again and it becomes a hot button issue. In this economy, we absolutely can not afford another energy crisis. We need natural gas, solar energy, wind energy, and other forms of natural alternative energy to clean up the planet and get the economy out of a very perilous position indeed.    The situation we are in right now dwarfs what we would have if a massive war broke out in the Middle East or the greedy speculators started jacking up prices again like the summer of 2008. At least gas prices are low.     And the oil companies are reporting losses for the first time since before Bush/Cheney were in office. Conoco Phillips reported 4th quarter losses of $31.8 billion. The other Big Oil companies will follow with their 4th quarter reports soon.|`|Hh0PtDYKaa	NO!  Mostly because we are not in a global warming, but rather a global cooling.  Actually we are starting to enter into another ice age.  All of this global warming stuff is a hoax to pass laws that infringe on our rights and to line the pockets of politicians.  Al Gore is becoming filfthy rich off of fear mongering.  Plus part of this stimulus is to pay for carbon credits!!?  We do not need it and the real proof is out there.  Why is everyone ignoring it?|`|BMbrcABWaa	No, we need oil to balance our banking cartel.  Without oil, the bankers can't pay off the debt they create when they print money or make bad loans to 3rd world countries then allow them to refinance and forever pay interest to the bank because they will never be able to pay it off.  They sell oil and other commodities back and forth in the international market and create money to pay off the debts they create and the rest is eaten up in inflation.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	These are the kinds of things we should be focusing upon, but the end results will cost the international bankers and their friends at OPEC a lot of profits.
mG6Pu12Paa	Arms in this context would reference 'Fire Arms' as in guns.  How would you be able to protect without ammunition?  This has been argued many times in court due to the fact it also states 'A well regulated militia' and the definition of that.  I have done research on this and found arguments about what is meant by 'keep and bear arms' it goes back and forth.  The courts keep changing their minds on the true meaning of the 2nd amendment.  I believe last case the definition agreed on is that individuals can have a gun but it can only be used in self defense.|`|AA11847612	Yes.    More interestingly, look up the definition of "bear" and then tell me that we have that right.|`|AA11702773	Whatever it takes in case you need a militia -- or to defend yourself against gangs after a Katrina type incident.|`|OlfVNTuYaa	Its fairly hard to shoot something without bullets.

I've also been making my own bread. I bought a scooter which gives me about 100 miles per gallon. We are living in a police state and every one is denying it. It is maddening. There's the guy bulogovich or however you spell it being recorded about selling a senate seat and people still don't believe it. The government is literally buying banks and giving money to companies and people still don't think it's really happening.   I talk about this all of the time and people just think I am nuts.

This can only be accomplished two ways.  Either we need to put sufficient pressure on the Congress to reign in an out-of-control Executive, and and out-of-control Judiciary, and start repealing unconstitutional legislation and departments, or we need to replace that Congress.    That is the ONLY way to solve our problems, and the way to accomplish this is to continue our educational efforts.  When sufficient Americans understand the problem, they will solve it at the voting booth.  There are no shortcuts.  The Insiders' weakness is the Congress, especially the House of Representatives.  We need to force them to comply with their oath to the Constitution, or we have to replace them with Americans who will.  It's as simple as that.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I agree.  Toyota, Nissan, Honda, BMW are American cars built by American hands.    Where a Chevy is South Korean and a Ford is Hecho en Mexico.    I am upset they got money.  Because they build there cars outside.  And they have their heads in the 1960s.    Fiat makes a great vehicle.  40 to 65 mpg on diesel.  We can't have them in America.  mpg is too good.  VW has in Europe a car that get close to 100mpg on diesel.  Again we are not allowed to buy them here.    Stubbornness and an unwillingness to change has just about destroyed our country.    I was given a car years ago because I have no money.  It is a 1983 Mercedes Diesel.  I get 40mpg with it.  I have driven it for 8 years without ever having to fix anything on it.  25 year old car.  It is ugly.  But it functions as new.  369 thousand miles of trouble free service.    People get mad when I say I would like a Corolla.  A ten year old Corolla is worth ten grand here.  A ten year old chevy maybe one grand.  Why the difference in value?  Exactly the difference in value.  I could drive a 1998 Corolla for ten more years.  a 1998 Cavalier I would not feel comfortable going down to the store in it.    In 1988 if you told me a Korean car was twice as good as an American car, I would have laughed at you.  In 20 years... In 2008 it wasn't funny any more.|`|KcAehrrKaa	It could be so easy.

B9ylNKecaa	After the Reagan tax cuts which were the most significant ones in USA since the Great depression, we had some big budget deficits.  After the 8 year Clinton presidency and the modest tax hikes that he put in place, the budget balanced again and we had a slight surplus.  After the Bush tax cuts, the country experienced massive record budget deficits which still exist today.    There is a latin legal term that I forgot that basically says "the thing speaks for itself".|`|84pz6eIVaa	Tax cuts alone don't raise the debt. In many cases they bring more money into the government. There are other important things that cause debt to rise and fall, like spending.    Here is a great chart that shows the history of the National Debt. As you can see, debt went down dramatically during Kennedy and LBJ (when taxes were cut). It also went down a little during Carter, even though he raised taxes. Then Reagan came along and cut taxes and it went up again, Clinton raised taxes and it went up, then down at his mid-term (when Gingrich took over and cut spending), then W Bush came along and raised it a little higher than Clinton (but keep in mind, spending was at an all-time high with two wars and a terrorist attack that nearly crippled Wall Street).     This study proves that there is more to this equation that taxes alone, spending is more important. The way Obama is spending he will surely break all those records.    http://zfacts.com/p/318.html|`|AA11847612	You will not get any "facts". You will only get opinions and statistics.

Most of them aren't even forty hour jobs now.    Oh yeah, go to the ER, they will treat you, bill you and then you can file for bankruptcy because you can't pay your bill in full in a timely manner and they won't accept what you can pay each week.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Great question.  The answer, to my mind, is that those who work should subsidize health care for those who don't.  It would also be great if the cost of health care was reduced so that it was less of a burden.  There have been some great strides in universal health care in most other western nations; we should try and learn from them.  Of course, nothing will be done until the people who so vehemently oppose universal health care realize it's only a matter of time until they, too, can't afford it.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	Just go to the emergency room.

Then when they are deathly ill, they go to the ER, get a little help and a huge bill. Then the hospital decides they need to be admitted, but won't do it because they can't afford to pay. So the hospital puts them out on the street.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	They won't. They will join the rest of uninsured America.

Overtime and second jobs are not taxed and they are able to get over that hump of sustenance to success.  The FairTax Plan is a comprehensive proposal that replaces all federal income and payroll taxes with an integrated approach including a progressive national retail sales tax on new items only, a rebate to ensure no American pays federal taxes on spending up to the poverty level, dollar-for-dollar federal revenue replacement, and, through companion legislation, repeal of the 16th Amendment. This nonpartisan legislation (HR 25/S 1025) abolishes all federal personal, gift, estate, capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, self-employment, and corporate taxes and replaces them with one simple, visible, federal retail sales tax  collected by existing state sales tax authorities. The FairTax taxes us only on what we choose to spend, not on what we earn. It does not raise any more or less revenue; it is designed to be revenue neutral. The FairTax is a fair, efficient, transparent, and intelligent solution to the frustration and inequity of our current tax system. More details can be found at http://www.fairtax.org   The income tax equation is  income- taxes-compliance dollars = spending  The Fair Tax equation is   income = spending + taxes+ compliance dollars,  so here we are taxed as we spend and keep the compliance costs|`|AA10907244	They make money out of thin-air with the Federal Reserve.

vIiG3NILaa	I fully agree with you. The main reason that weed is a gateway drug is because the dealer will ask you, hey want some crack? (lol maybe not so bluntly but you get the point) and if you've ever thought about trying crack you'll cave in a buy some. But if you now that you never ever want to do anything worse than weed you won't. weed is only a gateway drug to people who are going to use hard drugs later in life anyway.    And by the way, i am a sucessfuly, happy pothead. weed is no worse than booze. i can go to work and do a GREAT job and then go home and light one up. its no different than anyone having a Jack and Coke after work to take the edge off the day. Its how i relax and the only way i stop my self from strangling the insurance companies i work with on a daily basis.

Whatever their "drug of choice". They use a drug (whether narcotic or alcohol) to escape reality."    That is true and an addiction could also be shopping, blowing money on porn or strippers, etc.  Those are also ways to escape reality -  but I think those are also worse than smoking weed - in the big picture.    ------  Now for the original question:    I used to smoke twice a day (at least).  And now I have two degrees and will go back for a third.  I don't smoke anymore, not for any specific reason.  But I did smoke for at least 10 years pretty frequently.  I never tried any other drug - that "gateway drug" crap is BS.  I had many opportunities to do it as well and I never did.  Alcohol is defintiely worse as far as the long-term physical side effects, the level of the buzz/high and the person's ability to control what they are doing, memory loss, etc.    Miss Honesty - you have never smoked.  Don't judge.  Like I said smoked for a good 10 years - never had any laced weed - because a smart person smokes & buys from those they trust.  And about a successful pothead?  Pffff..I know tons - people you wouldn't ever think smoke it - do smoke it.      As a pothead, I got the first job of my life, which I worked for over 5+ years, then came to my current job and have been here over 3+ years (and I worked both jobs at the same time for a while).  During those 8+ years I got 2 degrees - working full-time and going to college full-time - and some semesters more credits than what is considered full-time for college.  Oh, and graduated with honors for both degrees.  Sounds pretty successful to me.    My first time smoking I was 14 or 15...and I just wanted to make a comment about someone else who said that kids could get their hands on it easier.  It is easy for teens to get weed - but trust me, it is just as easy for a teen to get weed as it is to get alcohol.  And alcohol is so much worse.|`|AA11847612	Addicts are addicts.

While I am a liberal, nevertheless, I blame every politician, past and present on capital hill for this mess.    The goal we need now is to stop this divisive blaming and work together.  This should be viewed as a war, a war to get this country back on its feet.  A war that could bring us together.    But we'd rather have our divisive politics under the banner of neocon demigods through the leadership of the anti American known as Limbaugh to further divide this country so we will be assured of failure.    That my friend is not partisan crap, that is a fact.    Peace  Jim    .|`|1fa9dcc86fab721927e4c4dd2833ebecaa	Before I start I want to point out that I am in no way a supporter of Dubya or his administration, but as a patriot I need to remind people that he didn't cause the mess.  He contributed, but he didn't cause it.  The root of the evil is the Federal Reserve, fiat currency and the manipulation of the market through artificial lowering of interest rates and price fixing.  The problems we are having now is that the Market is correcting itself and we need to allow it to happen.  The market is self regulating and it does not care how many trillions of debt-dollars you throw at it to try and prop it up.  The market is manipulated to keep the money flowing through to the big business and politicians, and when it comes back to bite them in the a$$ they don't care because they own the people who make decisions and they just bury the burden on the people and their children.  My advice to you is to educate yourself on this crisis and stop leading people down the wrong path.  You are listening to Keynesians when you should be listening to the students of Austrian School who have predicted all of America's economic problems.  Take some time and go google Keynesian and Austrian theories.  You're going to be surprised when you find out that Keynes hated individual freedom and private ownership.  Isn't that what's supposed to make America so great?|`|Souvww0maa	He didn't cause this mess.  Congress did.

In fact, surprisingly little is a direct result of him or his policies. We have our congress to thank for our current troubles, both the previous republican and the current democratic congress and any one sitting on one side of the fence lobbing stones at ONLY the democrats, or ONLY the republicans is a delusional partisan and has no credibility.    I would ask you (and anyone else wanting to lay the blame on one party) What specific legislation did Bush veto, that he should not have that caused this? And likewise, what specific legislation did he sign into law that resulted in our current mess? Sorry, but you can't lay the blame at Bush's feet for this one except to the extent that his war spending contributed.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	No, a real nightmare would be having your comprehension of current and recent events.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Bush may have contributed to the mess, but Obama is pushing the same type of mess right onto our plates and people are eating it up and washing it down with the "everything is beautiful" Obama punch.|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	The Democrats have controlled BOTH Houses of Congress for the last two years--|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Honey, you don't understand politics or current events that well.

There are many pros and cons about the development of this system.  I'll attempt to demonstrate many reasons why the system should not be built and put into operation. Here are twenty-one reasons the planning and implementation of the Missile Defense system are fraught with errors and dangers making it prudent to halt its development and call for diplomacy with Russia and Eastern Europe to resolve this travesty on the American people. Later in this piece, I include further evidence and explanations.    21 Reasons Against the Missile Defense System:    1. Testing objectives consistently are not met, cost overruns and scheduling delays  are rampant. The MDS doesn't work.     2. There is no evidence that Iran has threatened to attack Europe.    3. There is little evidence that Iran has a missile that could strike Europe.    4. Russia has threatened to deploy missiles, which could hold nuclear warheads, a short distance away from the Interceptors - and use them.    5. Having missiles in Poland might threaten other countries in the region that, in turn, might escalate their own missile programs.    6. The U.S. has not conducted one test where more than one missile was fired at a target at the same time in order to determine if the "shield" could detect them and the interceptors launched could destroy them.     7. At further costs of billions of dollars the U.S. taxpayer cannot afford it.    8. The majority of people in Poland and the Czech Republic strongly oppose it.     9. It would have a "negative impact on the whole Euro-Atlantic security system,    10. The US missile shield plan with Russia's missiles set north of Poland to retaliate are ,"as twin threats to Europe" said French President and the head of the EU, Nicolas Sarkozy .    11. It would lead to an expansion of the arms race.    12. It will also put Poland and the Czech Republic, the 'host' countries, on the front line subject to attack.    13. It would deter progressive treaties and agreements with Russia, the U.S. and the EU on conventional and nuclear weapons.    14. Plans now in effect to combine the MDS with other missile systems would compromise future attempts for reconciliation with Russia.    15. Distorted information on the U.S. missile defense radar has been provided by the head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.    16. Many Czech people who vowed not to allow foreign troops on their territory again would be compromised by U.S. technicians and personnel working on the radar shield system.    17. Many people in the U.S. oppose the system, as well as other missile programs and the inflated military budget - especially during these war years, costing tax payers billions of dollars, thousands of lives and  much prestige in the world.    18. The U.S. Congress, the House and Senate, have put the breaks on giving money to build the system, for various reasons.     19. The Pentagon, the U.S. Military Headquarters own test and evaluation office, says the technology, particularly in the version planned for Europe, remains unproven. More engineering work was needed before tests could prove the system's effectiveness, the office said.    20. During the last 10 years or so the costs of missile defense has run about $10 billion average, per year. We simply cannot afford to invest any more money into it.      21. If the U.S. continues development and starts to build the system in Poland and/or the Czech Republic and Russia retaliates, a major war could develop, even a nuclear war, which might destroy Europe and jeopardize the rest of the world.     Evidence and Explanations supporting the case against missile defense in Europe     According to a report by the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, "Time To Rethink Missile Defense", by Lt. Gen. Robert Gard and Kingston Reif, published in Defense News, October 20, 2008:  "Despite the Bush administrations investment of an estimated $60 billion since 2001, US national missile defense continues to be an unnecessary and counterproductive enterprise. Testing objectives consistently are not met, cost overruns and scheduling delays are rampant."     In Greg Kaufmann's, Missile Defense: "Longest Running Scam, posted by The Nation Editor, Katrina Vaden Heuvel, on March 7, 2008, reviews testimony on March 6, 2008 in Congress with Rep. John Tierney, Chair of the House National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Poughshares Fund, and author of Bomb Scare: The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons, provided the committee with a pointed assessment of the Missile Defense System in Europe situation: "I have known ballistic missile threats, I have researched ballistic missile threats, Mr. Chairman, this is not a serious ballistic missile threat that we face today. There is every reason to believe that it can be addressed through measured military preparedness and aggressive diplomacy."  Mr. Cirincione organized the last serious hearings on the program 15 years ago. "I believe that the Ballistic Missile Defense program is the longest running scam in the history of the Department of Defense.

They can't help it......even if the worse happens and we are full blown in a depression and the country is going to hell and hand basket, they will probably say that its only happening cause we did not give enough tax cuts to the rich and have too many regulations.    Consider these facts......go back to the period leading up to the great depression and find out how low taxes suddenly dropped for the wealthy for the 7 years leading up to the depression.  Also find out how around 1928 ..1929...the top 1% of income earners in USA were actually earning the greatest percentage of total earnings ever in american history. Its also not a coicidence that the last 3 presidents leading up to 1929 stock market crash were all Republicans.|`|84pz6eIVaa	Yes, all the republicans, plus a few democrats voted against this bill because it spends record amounts of money on stupid things at a time when money is tight. we need to cut spending right now, not expand it.

uPNP1xzpaa	I am in import/export/wholesale and manufacturing sector. We used to use sales agent to help us get import/export/wholesale and then we got rid of them and do it directly ourselves. Unfortunately, lots of the buyers in the U.S. are unable to pay for merchandise they order, and we are unwilling to give out any credit term at this time. Therefore, it turned out a big mess for us in the U.S., fortunately, we focus on global market, therefore, we still have orders from other European countries and Asia. But the sales went down a lot, the obvious thing I noticed that I did not have any annual bonus this year!!!! But i am glad I still have my job.    The market is getting weaker ever since Bush got on his 2nd presidency. Who to blame? I don't think Bush should be the only one to blame, people should also blame the congress and the senate that they can not work together to pass real beneficial bills for people.

These corporate pigs are selling out MILLIONS of American worker's to the third-world for a profit, which is solely for selfish purposes.    Barack Obama stressed his support for the middle class, so maybe he'll take measures to restrict corporate greed and thereby bring jobs back for middle Americans like me and you? I can only hope.    The answer is to bring jobs back to America and quit paying third-worlders slave-wages to do jobs that Americans can and will do.    And yes, I'm super pissed off.
fYUgURZmaa	I take it that you mean legal immigrants.    Social rights: they usually have the same rights (discrimination is illegal) but most social rights are linked to employment and immigrants, like the French nationals may lose some of their rights when they lose their job. There is a minimum living allowance in France that only French and other EU nationals are entitled to, as well as long-time residents, who have obtained unlimited time residency permit.    Political rights: voting is limited to French nationals. Other EU nationals residing in France are entitled to vote for local elections.    Illegal immigrants: even asylum seekers have no rights until they are granted resident status.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	I think so. Equality is a really big deal in France.

Most of the public are hard working folks trying to survive or too caught up in other things to really pay attention. Those other things can be shallow like in the stereotypes soap operas, materialism or American Idol for example but also very valuable contributions to society in other areas of life. They can be great moms, excellent teachers or great friends many can always depend on and that's what they give their all, unfortunately not leaving enough interest or energy to look beyond the mainstream in regards to politics.    The sad facts is also the politicians and their handlers, spin doctors are very well aware of the second group and play them like a fiddle never challenged and in fact aided and abetted by a corporate media that left it's crucial role as a watchdog long ago|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Ignorance is bliss|`|5syj6Uzaaa	mbush40 makes an excellent point considering your avatar name.  It is always the *other* politicians who lie, cheat and steal.  You clearly exhibit this behavior by endorsing a politician - even one (by all appearances) so upstanding as Ron Paul.    People believe politicians because "doing something" seems to always entail casting a vote.  Even when they generally distrust politicians, they still seem to trust (or at least hope in) the system that puts those politicians into power.    I go beyond your question.  Why do people still believe in political systems?  To answer, I think that a number of factors must play a role.  It has never occurred to most people that there could be alternatives to ordering society that would not depend upon politics at all.  Furthermore, they have been indoctrinated since youth that "We The People" form the government.  Because of this self-identifying, people tend to be more tolerant of the abuses of the system, blaming those *other* politicians.    They should consider more the nature of the system.  Politics should be restrained in favor of voluntary institutions.|`|ObfEroZMaa	That is the best question I've heard in months.|`|AA11058591	heehee, yer handle dude.|`|kKdUhS2gaa	they are sheep, they believe the commercial,they believe the media dumbasses|`|OlfVNTuYaa	I know a lot of politicians.

lvBUl3Zdaa	There is no evidence that the information obtained through torture is correct, especially in the case of Khalid Sheik Mohammed. When you torture somebody, they make stuff up to make it stop.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	Water boarding is both an interrogation technique and a method of torture.  However, when it comes to torture, it's extremely mild by comparison with what really goes on in a torture chamber, much of which makes the average person phycially sick.    In any event, I should like to inform you that the British have used torture in the past and probably still do, not merely to get confessions, but also to take revenge upon their enemies.    The London Cage  http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/nov/12...    When I joined the British Army in 1957 aged 16, I had a troop sargeant who had been in the SAS in WW2.  He told me that in 1946 he had been sent back into Germany with a lot of other SAS men.  Their task was to hunt down former Gestapo and SS men and kill them.    You do not want to hear about the killing methods.  I'll just say this, the SAS killed hundreds of these Nazis in a manner which took more than six hours for most of them to die.    These were the revenge killings for what the SS and Gestapo had done to captured British Commandos and soldiers.  The SS burned alive an entire squadron of captured British soldiers in a barn in France as they retreated towards Dunkirk.    This sargent of mine also told me that he personally put to death an SS sargent who had been in charge of the gas ovens at Belsen and who had put British SOE Agent Odette Churchill into the ovens while she was alive - burnt alive.  It took the SAS several days to slowly kill this man.  When you've been shot in the legs a few dozen times, you know real pain.  It got worse, including burning the hair off with petrol and all manner of evil tortures.    Don't even ask.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Would you want that done to you?

And because there are situations where time is of the essence. And because the first (only?) job of a politician is to get re-elected; and that AIN'T gonna happen if said pol cannot claim (believably) that he did EVERYTHING in his power to avert an attack that nevertheless occurred.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	The US Constitution extends the right not to be tortured to US citizens.

Sometimes, I think that people who complain about this should be shown video from 911 of people jumping out windows of the wtc and plunging to their death.  Compared to that, water boarding is a walk in the park.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Hmmm.   Beats anything on a humanitarian basis than what the Radical Muslim terrorists do to any of their prisoners.   Waterboarding- try to catch Dennis Miller's take on it: Green Boarding.   Hilarious!  If you don't want to watch the whole thing, it's in the last minute of the video.

The US tried and convicted Japanese officers after WWII for doing it to US soldiers.    Now unless something in the waterboarding procedure has radically changed in the last 60 years (which I doubt considering that the procedure dates back to the Spanish Inquisition), I cannot figure out how it was considered torture then and not now?    Does that mean we falsely convicted Japanese officers after WWII for doing it?|`|i6kgDVdPaa	taking the life of an innocent deserves more than water boarding .|`|AFqZEOlRaa	I always imagine that if I were about to be tortured, I would tell my captors "Look, just tell me what you want me to say.

People can be tortured into admitting to anything.  Look at the Spanish Inquisition.  Despite what people say about torture working in Mohammed case, how do you know that it did?

He shouldn't be passing off expenses to you. You have the upper hand when it comes to supply and demand.     Do some research of similar rental units where you live and let your landlord know that you could easily move elsewhere but would prefer to stay if they will keep the rent the same. Lots of people have moved in with relatives or roommates due to loss of jobs which has increased the amount of rentals on the market, and in return, decreased the demand for them.    In these tough times, no landlord wants a vacant apartment. That's at least a month's loss in rent.

I'm not sure whether it is too late to press charges or not...but it's never too late to have her tell her story to a lawyer and get it put into a Affidavit...then the lawyer shows the Affidavit to a judge and he may change the custody situation...I know because I had a similar experience with my sister's husband when I was a kid...it was like 10 years ago, but I told the lawyer about it and he lost custody of my nieces because of what he did. I never looked into pressing charges though.|`|AA10720479	Never too late, keep this from happening to someone else. If an incident is on record, it will be easier to convict if something else were to happen.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	Many states have NO statute of limitations on sex crimes against children...you can report it decades later if you like..    The problem is that, the more time passes, the more difficult it is to prosecute.  Because of the nature of these crimes, they often come down to "he said, she said" with a great deal of emotional burden placed on the victim.  As emotionally charged as these cases are, prosecutors will still weigh them as to whether the case can be won or not.    The crime should be reported as soon as possible so that the victim can re-tell the story in a consistent manner.  The main thing is that the victim must be assured that there is NO shame in it for her.  The more she is able to understand that she has no reason to be ashamed or afraid, the more likely she will feel free to tell an accurate and consistent story.|`|Yzcptoagaa	It's not too late.  The statute of limitations is typically longer than 3 years for most crimes.  And when a crime against a child is involved, the statutary time limit is usually tolled until such time as the child is able to report the incident.|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	No, it is not.  Report him now.  Do not force your daughter to see him any longer.|`|29fa5460a9c16006e5e07e22271195c2aa	No it is not too late. You need to contact Children Services. Do not ask her anymore about it and try not to have her talk anymore about it until she talks with them or they will say you could have coached her. Call them right away and start a case. If they make it a founded report he will not be allowed to be around children alone. So, call them right away. It is not uncommon for children to not be able to talk to there parents about it as they are children and think they will get in trouble. They have several emotions running through there heads. You can contact me through email for any additional help on this. Good luck to you and I would also go back to court with this and stop all visitation.|`|r18PoGJiaa	Why the heck would you wait????????  Report this ASAP!|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	You can report it up to the age of 18, and depending upon which state you live in, you can go beyond that. For example, I live in Massachusetts. A crime like this can be reported beyond the age of 18, up to 15 years. So, that means, you can report it up to the age of 33. Quite a long time. However, the longer you wait, the harder it is to prove your case. I can tell from the way you are asking, she is still a child, you can and should,  report it now.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You need to report this ASAP.

579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	To file, it would be about $200-$300. For any possible chance, as minor emancipations are really rarely approved, you would have to be able to show you can support yourself financially, have somewhere to live, show responsibility, and show that you would benefit from being separated from your parents. The age you can apply would depend on your state...typically 16 is about average but Ive seen some states go as low as 14. You do not need your parents consent to file, although you have a better chance for approval if they did, but your proof of benefiting from being apart from them comes into play here. You really need to show an immense amount of maturity for your age. Keep in mind that the conditions of your home life would have to be EXTREME in order for a judge to approve emancipation. So if your complaint is that they dont let you go out with friends (example), thats not going to cut it. After filing, your case would be heard within about 30-60 days.|`|r18PoGJiaa	In order to get emancipated, you have to have parents' consent and go in front of a judge. It's not likely for a judge to give the consent. You must have a job, transportation, schooling, a place to live, etc. If you have all those things and a good reason on emancipation you may get the consent from the judge.   Average cost 100 - 300|`|9BUc0lgjaa	cost would be that of a lawyer, and like all things in law the circumstance is time consuming and convoluted. essentially the basic series of events is this/: you decide you wnat to be emancipated. you go to a judge and attempt to justify your emancipation. assuming you qualify for age etc, and the judge decides that your reason is valid (rarely except in cases of abusive parents, even then, usually only if they refuse to take parenting courses) then he will officially deem you legally emancipated from that family. you no longer are concidered next of kin etc in any way to those people, given a few exceptions, and the process is, (nearly) irreversable.

4qBLgY9naa	First, please go to school. You obviously need an education and right away.    Second, if you had an education or any common social knowledge, you would know that you can't go to jail for not going to school.    However, you can be sent to school for not going to jail.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	"THEY WANT TO LOCK ME UP"    Who is "they"?  You can only go to jail as punishment for committing a crime.  However, you can be put into juvenile custody if your guardians say that you can't be controlled by them.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Judging by your writing skills, I'd say you really need to go to school, badly.

owY6C8cqaa	Kick her ***.    Failing that, go through with charging her- she shouldn't be allowed to get away with some like that, the scumbag.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	How would it be felony larceny?  AFAIK, laptops don't cost more than a few hundred dollars for the really expensive ones, and most felony larceny statutes set value at a few thousand dollars.  Other exceptions - if it was stolen from your person (that's in NYS anyway).    You should talk to her parents.  If she's stupid enough to steal when she's on "a last chance contract" w/probation, then she's in serious need of intervention.  (If she's on probation at all, her PO may be checking w/her school and can therefore find out about the theft w/o an arrest).    If you talk to her parents, they may volunteer to pay you for the iPod in order to keep their daughter out of trouble.
AA11764194	ECNR means emigration check is not required..     along with Visa and air ticket you need emigration check to travel to certain countries.. so if you are a degree holder or income tx payee or over 60 years old, submit the Docs to passport office.. they wl put seal in back page of  your passport saying ECNR...    If you have this ECNR seal no hassle to travel or else you need to submit visa and Passport to the particular country consulate.. they wl put seal for a particular time of Visa..    It is confusing but you need ENCR seal to travel abraod despite having vailde passport and visa..    Hope I helped|`|MgTU7zz6aa	ECNR stands for Emmigration Check Not Required, You need a graduation certificate to be eligible for the same.
kZdyPspmaa	The case really isn't about the Governor, its about the national economy.  With every day bringing worse news about the stability of the country, its economic policies, the state of employment, etc. people are beginning to "take to the streets".  For US citizens I think that means media - mostly because we are too lazy to actually take to the streets (like the French are doing today 1-29-09).    Bringing down the Governor is a way of telling elected officials that they need to get it right.  This Governor is the People's whipping-boy.    A similar thing may be developing for Governor Richardson of New Mexico.  He resigned from President Obama's Commerce Secretary position even before he was approved and now there are Federal investigations into his handling of the NM State budget and where those couple of million dollars disappeared to.    In my mind, this is a wake up call to stop trusting elected officials, appointees, and their employees.  We sent them off to Congress, the White House, and State Capitals without ever asking what they are doing.  Remember, the right to bear arms was not written in to protect us from foreign invaders but to give us a means to topple the government when it isn't doing what we want/need.|`|eXL3WayHaa	Its such a big deal, and gaining so much publicity, due to the fact that he's being impeached over it.  There hasn't been a governor impeached in the US for over 20 years, and imo they couldn't have picked a better s.o.b to start on again.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	The Big Deal was He was wrongly Accused and Now Wrongly throw-en Out of Office They knew that He was about to sell Obama's senate seat, Take Money from the Children Memorial Hospital and Get Money from the Tribune and Fire their Writers It was really Blagojevich was being treated Unfairly, Well Lawmakers in Springfield just wanted to throw him out since the Day he was elected Governor because he was to shut them all out to help the People of Illinois and that's what he did.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	It's Obama's seat, it's blatant corruption rather than discreet, and most of all because people watch and media is a business|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	The seat he was taking money to fill was the seat Obama left open.      I just don't see how Blago can claim to be innocent when it's right on audio tape.  Perhaps he thinks in the realm of Illinois politics he didn't do anything wrong. That could be accurate.|`|c1379040fcc5c4a581798d49a39f2446aa	he choked and choked us all|`|4c7QomPoaa	lol  the man is a bit slimey looking imho.

AA12196812	Yes, you should (even though I don't know... it's expensive?). Did your husband go to a doctor? He needs to have some proof of injuries.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	you could do 3 things.    have your husband file an incident report at work.    call the police and press charges for assault.    get a lawyer to help you navigate the legal system.    The first step is for your husband to sit down and write out his story. his memory will be best now because it happened recently. so have him write down exactly what happened on paper. after it's written I would either file a report at his work and then go to the police station and talk to an officer about your options.    and just so you know, the term is "HOT HEAD"|`|0P9GYAx6aa	You need a backdoor man to give that bully a beat down.  For a fee, I might choose to be, your backdoor man.  Dirty Deeds done dirt cheap.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	Yes.  At least talk to one.  The hot head employee should be fired.  He is a proven threat to the rest of the employees.  The employer is open to liability because he is aware of employee  1's temper and outbursts and has done nothing.  There are rules on workplace violence.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	You might have a case.. You would need witnesses to testify what actually took  place.. If he was not the instigator and did nothing to provoke the attack, then I would say your case would have some merit.|`|AA10925759	Were there witnesses? If so this hot head could be charged for assault.    Once that is done your husband will basically become unfireable. There are a million ways the employer would have to pay out if he did.|`|N3S9S1joaa	Can you say ASSAULT?|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Might be an idea yes,it was assault afterall................|`|ObfEroZMaa	Since you husband is 60, he needs to even up the fight a little bit.    Pepper spray, a taser, a bat, a sword...    I'd go ahead and call a lawyer.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	Talk to an attorney about your husbands rights. Your husbands employer may have been out of line and the man who pushed him down could face assault charges.|`|kg0ig2Edaa	His employer is using an even handed approach. By giving both parties a warning he leaves no opening for a grudge on either parties side. If he merely gave the other guy a warning the chap who pushed your husband would feel picked on and would hold a grudge against him and possibly cause more trouble.    At the end of the day your husband would be well advised to take legal consultation on the issue and keep written records of everything.|`|K1iUzewyaa	probably if it was unprovoked, but have a feeling that is not the case. Either way, you do not go and push and elderly person, we all know that a little age can make one more grouchy( some at least), but in the end we just laugh it off, cause they are still good people.. anyways, don't be quick to sue the company... try to work it out without court... but if the other guy doesn't loose his job for this, I would seek out some compensation, especially since he doesn't want to be around a hot head who goes around pushing coworkers... Have everything documented,especially hospital visits if it was seriously that bad...|`|w6ierPdtaa	This exact scenario happened at my husbands work. Long story short the supervisor who did the pushing held on to his job for 9 months after the incident happened. The man he pushed down, was unprovoked, there were witnesses.  This is a union employer. The man who was pushed to the ground (union worker) got fired.  The union did not protect him. The supervisor had no repercussions until he did it again a few months ago.  It was only now that the employer realized they had a liability problem and fired the wrong man.  We were specificially told by the union "if it happens again, call the police and file an assault charge".  I think this is what you should do as it is what we were specifically told to do.  Good Luck.
cvBkyVRyaa	You need to find him and get his address.    Part of the process of filing a lawsuit is the fact that the other party has to be subpoenaed to court for the hearing.      Try calling 411 and ask them to give you the address and zip code of the last phone number you have.  This is very effective.  You could also check with the local utilities, sometimes they can help. Additionally you may be able to work through the County probate records to get his info on a property or vehicle he may own or have registered (car tag, etc).  He can be served at his place of employment if you know that info.      try these links.    http://www.peoplesearchnow.com/?utm_sour...    http://www.intelius.com/    http://www.usa-people-search.com/      Best of luck.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	Well it would do you some good, if you were to research him.

If they can't serve him they can't have a trial, it would violate due process.

If you grow up in this country and you look black then you have the same experiences specific to blacks, and you end up identifying as black.  I've never seen so much dedication to breaking down ethnic percentages since Obama's election.  It seems to me that the people finding issue with this have some personal problems with his election and with recognizing that he is, in all relevant ways, our first black President.  If it's important to you that's fine.  But most of us don't find the need to pick this apart.  Oh, and thanks for reminding me of his middle name, I might have forgotten it otherwise (rolling eyes).|`|GNNh52OMaa	since obama wants change and racial unity, he promotes he embraces his black race, marries a woman who only embraces her black community, attends a church who's pastor condemns "white" america, had a black mentor who was into communism...while his sheep continue to support this guy with a blind eye knowing full well that they had the help of those who voted this guy based on skin color alone. does that make sense? and his sheep who voted based on "credentials" continue to know the facts but support him with a blind eye.     oh well, his supporters just rant on about giving this guy a chance while ignoring the obvious.... this is what america has become.    and those blacks that claim based on appearance and the one drop rule that he is in his right to claim being black, which ironically would prove to us that they voted based on skin color to spite us. so this equality that they were fighting for was all but just a ploy.|`|R7Hexutqaa	You confuse racial identity with a legal definition.  There is no legal definition.    President Obama was raised mostly in a white world, but no one would label him white, and he more easily adopted a black racial identity.  (I dare say that Warren Harding could never have adopted anything other that a white racial identity - no matter what the law of the day)    Obama does not hide his mix raced heritage.  But being mixed race does not disallow him from adopting a largely African-America identity.  Without specific knowledge of his ancestry would you consider him anything other than African-American - Assuming you just had to consider him something other than just "American".
jhNUuz0maa	The Air Force still needs people. The only thing is, what are you willing to do. You might want a certain job, but they might be overmanned in that job, so you might have to take a different job.    As far as the DUI, if it was expunged from the record, it probably won't even be a factor. If you are interested, contact a recruiter and start the process. When you do that, you can bring up the DUI, and you will be advised from there. More than likely, the recruiter will advise you not to put it on any paperwork, since it was expunged.    I haven't heard of anything that states they aren't accepting any more recruits. I wouldn't wait either. Contact a recruiter's office and get it started.     I been in the Air Force for 18+ years.

My car was broken into (they broke into a bunch of cars that night) and the couple was arrested, they were convicted and I brought them to small claims court for the items they stole (about $1400 worth of items) but the judge found in their favor because the prosecutor had not charged them with breaking into my car (only 3 others). They had already be ordered to pay restitution to the other car owners and because they were never charged with breaking into my car they owed me nothing.|`|A13xffyFaa	First and foremost you are talking about juvenile.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes.    The phrases in Barack Obamas inauguration speech that have evoked the greatest enthusiasm across the political spectrum of the US establishment, from the Republican right to liberal Democrats, were those suggesting that the American people are responsible for the present economic catastrophe. Our economy is badly weakened, he declared, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.  Precisely what those hard choices are Obama did not specify, but he made clear they in no way involve a challenge to the capitalist market system, declaring that its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.  He broadly hinted that the hard choices he would make involve sweeping cuts in social programs, including ending programs that dont work. This policy of austerity, which, as he had previously indicated, would include cuts in bedrock programs such as Social Security and Medicare, was summed up in his call for a new era of responsibility.  The implicit demand for greater sacrifice from the American people was hailed by liberal commentators such as the Washington Posts David Ignatius, who praised Obama for telling the people that the crisis was partly our fault. He continued, We all know the Pogo line about how we have met the enemy, and he is us. Obama implicitly seemed to embrace it.  Right-wing columnist George Will in his Washington Post op-ed piece enthused over the same lines, writing that one of Obamas themes was that Americans do not just have a problem, they are a problem.  These approving comments accurately sum up the deeply reactionary and deceitful thrust of Obamas speech, behind its I feel your pain rhetoric. Obamas attempt to foist the blame for the failure of American capitalism on the American people is nothing short of a libel, the purpose of which is to obscure those social interests that are really responsible for the unfolding catastrophe and justify even deeper attacks on the working class.  The working class bears no responsibility for the collapse of the financial system and the resulting recession that is developing into a full-scale depression. Working people have no control over the policies and actions of the multimillionaires and billionaires who bestride Wall Street. They had no say in concocting the Ponzi schemes that generated multimillion-dollar compensation packages and colossal personal fortunes for the financial aristocracy until they collapsed, as they were bound to.  Working people are the victims of the maniacal greed of the corporate-financial elite, which itself is an expression of fundamental contradictions within the irrational economic system over which they preside. One would think from Obamas remarks that the broad masses of people in the US have been living the good life. In reality, for three solid decades they have seen their social position decline and their living standards deteriorate as an ever-greater share of the national wealth was funneled into the bank accounts of the ruling elite.  The single most significant feature of American lifethe staggering growth of social inequalitywent without mention in Obamas speech. He could not allude to it and at the same time accuse the people of bearing collective guilt.  Obamas single fleeting reference to corporate criminalitygreed and irresponsibility on the part of somewas itself a cover-up. On the part of some? The virtual collapse of the US and global economy is not the result of a few bad apples or mere aberrational behavior. Fraud, incompetence, recklessness wereand remainpervasive and systemic in American capitalism.  This is a system that for decades has starved and dismantled basic industry, allowed the social infrastructure to rot and driven down the living standards of the majority of the population in order to generate higher profits for the elite from financial manipulation and speculation. The American ruling class stands exposed and disgraced before the world as a semi-criminal social layer.  Obamas new era of responsibility signifies, in reality, a general amnesty for the system, the class and those in government who are truly responsible for the crisis. None of the bankers and speculators who created a mountain of paper values on the basis of predatory home loans that were bound to fail are to be held accountable. Nor are the government regulators who ran interference and served as their accomplices. Likewise, the congressmen of both parties who dismantled regulations and slashed corporate taxes in exchange for campaign funds and other bribes.|`|vKR4tysjaa	Yes...

UvzKiis0aa	Because corporations are using the bad situation to their advantage.  Companies are laying people off because then they can scare their other workers into working harder for less while pocketing the savings on the laid off workers' wages and salaries.  It is a jump on the bandwagon, more short term profit making stupidity from corporations.    Yeah, people work harder but they don't spend money because they think they are next, and the laid off workers don't spend because they are laid off.

Then there is our two budget busting wars and our over militarization of the planet by having our military presence in well over 100 counties.    All of this can be blamed on our politicians, no matter what party, what idiology they claim, they simply did not have the balls to admit they are screwing up, but simply played the game of keeping their heads stuffed in each other azzzes.    While that is an oversimplification, it gives you a good indication of why were are such dire straights.    Peace  Jim    .

An at will employee can be fired for any reason, but since you lied on your application, that's a pretty good reason.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Yes.  You did not disclose a condition that will prevent you from doing the job they hired you for.  At-will employers may fire someone for any reason they choose, and you being so far along in your pregnancy would be an issue since you would be taking time off for the birth.  My husband was fired from a job because he wrote down the wrong dates of previous employment.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	If you are seven months pregnant, you are not able to do the job the employer wants done now.|`|AA12385489	Yes, it is against the law to fire someone because they are pregnant.    However, you should have told them you were pregnant so that they could accomodate you.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	Its more possible for them to do this for the simple fact that you are still in your probationary period, which means you can be let go for any reason. If you had been there for a year and then they fired you for being pregnant, then that would be a different story.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	Yes, Maternity leave is only granted to people that have been in long term employment, if you only just started they have no obligation to keep your position open for your return.  An employer can terminate employment of anyone for any reason during your probationary period, check your contract.|`|bieqGUEjaa	If the state you are living in is an At Will employment they can fire you even without cause.|`|nbibIzC5aa	I do not believe that they have a right to ask you if you are pregnant or if you plan on starting a family in the near future because that would be discrimination.  You may want to seek advice from an attorney to get the facts about the law and your situation.    Hope this helps.
hmA8nfA2aa	Qualifications required and how you become a police officer vary by state and by department. You should visit the websites of the police departments that you might be interested in working for. Police department websites often provide information about qualifications required, about how to apply, and about the hiring process. One of the best things that you can do is to attend college. There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer. Good luck!|`|BJERgbM5aa	You must apply for the job in the jurisdiction where you want to work.  Go to your local police department and tell them of your interest.  They'll advise you as to where to obtain an application.  After submitting the application, you will be interviewed, then investigated.  If you get through the interview and the investigation, then you go for a physical. Running, jumping, sit-ups, lifting, etc.  Get through that and you then go through a complete medical check-up.  Get through that and your name gets placed on a list.  When your name is next on the list, you get sent to a police school/academy.  Complete/graduate from this school and voila, you're a police officer.  Good Luck..|`|72JZHunmaa	Go to collage|`|rUNlmQG5aa	It always helps to be a bully in High School, as a precursor to the attitude that one must adopt for the next twenty years- by the way, why do they get to retire early?Isn't that a form of laziness that the people that they pursue enjoy?|`|cGGvZqJNaa	One must call or go on line to the police department one wants to join. Some jurisdictions require a college degree, while others require some college and/or military experience. You will go through a police academy before being hired.

As mentioned above, the Army will move their household goods.  Usually in two shipments, the first is "hold baggage", which is a small -usually   Note that the laws in D-land have changed now, and your son will NOT be allowed to ship weapons to Germany|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Why the caps?    If he is just training in Vilseck, they will not move her. But if he is stationed in Germany, she will be on his orders. The army movers will come and pack up her stuff. She will get on a plane and fly to his post. the army will give them living arrangements. And then about 2 months later her household goods will arrive. I say two months because that's how long it took to get our stuff back from Germany when he PCSed back to the states. I have seen it only take 5 weeks. But I have seen it take 10 weeks to get a car back to the states.
zlmnfFpYaa	Throughout his term it was something like 189.  I read it in the paper the other day.  There was no great frenzy of pardons at the end of his term like his predecessor had.  In fact, he turned down several requests for such notables as Michael Milliken and Leonard Peltier.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	As I understand it, none.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	None.  He commuted the sentence of two Border Patrolmen who a Liberal judge imprisoned for doing their job.  Clinton (whose old gang Obama has hired) holds the  record for Presidential pardons.
Wd5HJJqbaa	it reminds me of jimmy carter and obama.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	This is a case of trial in the media.  Therefore there is a stark difference.  There is no specific promise or demand of value for the vacant Senate seat for the state of Illinois on the taped conversation.  Prosecutors are attempting to bring a case on suggestion of corruption rather than hard evidence.    Law and opinion are two separate and apart entities.  Prosecutor Fitzerald has made several injudicious blunders in attempting to embarrass the Governor of Illinois.  Spicing information for media distribution is unethical and inappropriate.  Sensationalizing a thirst for corruption proceedings does not constitute evidence.    "Offer" and "acceptance" are the terms that must have proof to carry this case.  So far all that exists is the suggestion of corrupt conversation.  People must learn to listen carefully for the truth and fiction.    Governor Blagojevich has not censored or altered records of telephone conversations.  Prosecutor Fitzerald's assertions are weak.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I'd say the one who said "I am not a crook" comes to mind most readily. (Yes, he didn't say it as President, but it certainly came back to haunt him for his actions while President)|`|ky3B42f6aa	I was thinking of Richard M. Nixon, myself.  Or, closer to home, G.W. Bush.  (And, it is spelled "relations".)|`|YFMaRxaWaa	innocent until proven guilty. lol.|`|nG9nxMySaa	i first thought of nixon, who told frost something like, "if the president does it, it's not illegal." it's amazing how people can get caught so red-handed and still they seem to think they did nothing wrong. it will be interesting to see how blago holds up and if he will ever admit that he screwed up.

They love Obama, they love pork.  Oynk,,,,,Oynk,,,,,,|`|i2M7lyPgaa	Oh honey you missed the memo.  Its no longer 'creating' millions of jobs,  its now, 'saving' millions of jobs.      I guess when they realized that you can count jobs made but you have a bit harder time picking out jobs that might have been lost but are now saved, they changed the terms.    Much like global warming, (while it one of the coldest years every) has now become 'climate change'   there's that word again , change.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	pork & beans -Change you can believe. lmao.|`|WubBcqOBaa	"Most people don't even believe in Global warming anymore!"    WRONG! where are you getting this "most people" from??    "...only $ 30 million to infrastructure"    WRONG - Have you even READ the bill, ANY of the bill, before commenting on it?    In the most simplest of terms:  rebuilding much needed infrastructure creates jobs (who do you think is building? Supervising? Planning? Engineering?)    More jobs = better economy.    I just love how repubs on here commenting on this bill have so obviously NOT READ THE BILL! LMAO. typical...|`|jk0td5mPaa	The new Congress will hit the ground running on tax cuts. The House already approved a big package to help jump-start the economy and get extra money into taxpayers wallets, and the Senate will follow soon, with the goal of getting a bill to President Obamas desk by mid-February.    Obama knows what he's doing!! just let him lead.|`|RAjycr4waa	new federal cars keeps the car manufacturers going and gets some new cars for the govt. two birds with one stone.     who doesn't believe in global warming? rush limbaugh?     and money going into global warming saves and creates jobs for scientists etc. not just construction workers need help and its about time people like them start to realize this.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	actually, for infrastructure, 10% of the entire bill is going to: $836billion/10 = 80 billion dollars (unfortunately the society of civil engineers of america have said that our infrastructure (roads & bridges) need about $2 trillion dollars worth of work).   I'm not really sure where you got that $30 million from.   The 400 million for global warming, ok, that's only .004% of the total plan...|`|PVMsr2Faaa	Perhaps the Senate will vote it down as it is, but I am not holding my breath.    This is what happens when they want it done really quick. Much like the one Bush pushed through.

They are now calling global warming "Climate Chaos" because the whole global warming thing is flawed and non existent. There's a website that lists many of the things on the menu. I'm sure you can find it if you google it.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Don't forget the millions being set aside for all terrain vehicle trails.  We all know that's the answer...    We are so screwed.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	Where do you get that most people don't believe in global warming?  Most do, especially scientists!|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	The package has become the usual mess that makes it way through the House and Senate.  It's really sickening.  It's not that I don't support something being done... but there is so much pork snuck in on the bill it's a mistake that it's going to be passed.  It does pour money into transporation (building and improving our roads), education (building our schools, supporting teachers, etc.) , and technology - so there are some jobs that will be created.  But it's HUGE and I don't know how we're ever going to pay it all back.

Exactly how did he harm you?|`|wdBY1fWaaa	I thought it was great when they wouldn't allow him into Canada. He was all surprised. You can just see see that punk saying "What, I only bombed government buildings in the United States".    Barack "millhouse" Obama's terrorist friend Bill Ayers.|`|AA11163314	It is funny to hear mr 'wounded duck' ask if Ayers ever harmed you.    Gee, he only ordered the murder of policemen, ordered the attempted murder of a judge and his entire family, bombings of government buildings, arson of people's homes and other terrorist acts.    And he has even admitted that he does not have any remorse for those actions.  Not only that he only regrets getting caught because he was not able to commit more terrorist acts!    I guess that since he was buddies with Obama that this absolves him of all his sins in the eyes of a liberal.|`|9ZkzBiHxaa	isn't it great that that george bush punk is finally out of office?|`|ODORT37Paa	I didn't see that, let's hear some details.

As a landlord they can set the rules on what they do and don't allow. Since it isn't a seeing-eye dog and since you can go to school without living on campus there is little argument for you to offer.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	All universities are different and to my knowledge, none allow pets in dorms!!  If they did, everyone would bring fluffy from home to be with them and the place would be a zoo...not college!!|`|pNy8lakjaa	I would get a note from a doctor to state the reason for you having the rabbit there. If you can prove that you need your rabbit there for medical reasons, they by law have to allow you to keep it.|`|KasFZL7laa	get a letter from your doctor written to the university saying you need the rabbit as a therapy pet.  by law (depending on what state you are in), they are legally required to allow you to keep the rabbit.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Anyone who provides housing for others--ie: landlords, colleges that provide dorms for students--can make rules for the residents. They have every right to prohibit pets that are not seeing-eye dogs ,or some other type of animal that provides assistance to a disabled person. Maybe you can show that the rabbit falls into this category, but I highly doubt it. You always have the option of living in an apartment near campus that allows pets.|`|Nol96SXqaa	You would have to check with your state, as laws vary.    I'm from Ontario, Canada and here the landlord tenant act states a few rules on petss.  A landlord/rental company has the right to deny your application if you say you have a pet.  However, once you are an existing tenant, they cannot kick you out or terminate your lease based on the fact you have a pet (regardless of whether or not the lease forbids it) or force you to get rid of it.    Again, I would recommend checking with your state and talking to a mediator (your school might offer one to you as part of you student services).  Also, I'm not sure if student residences are governed by the same rules and regulations as other rental properties.    Sorry for no straight answer, but I hope it helps.
X3qAkn4haa	Blagojevich already complained on tape that the Obama people wouldn't "play ball" with him.  If he started claiming that Obama was in on it now, after getting caught, no one would believe him.|`|HZy629kLaa	Not gonna happen.  This dream that Blago is gonna take down Obama somehow really needs to end.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Well, he would have NO evidence.  And Obama can pardon himself.  Booya he wins.

If your going to drag the president through the mud you better be telling the truth.  To smear Obama at this point wouldn't be in Blagos best interest.  Everyone will know if a deal was made if Blago walks and that would probably be more damaging for Obama than Blago saying a bad word about him.  So the best outcome for Obama is a stiff penalty for Blago with no deals.  As a republican I don't find any humor in any of this. Greed and Corruption is rampant in America I wish everyone would find a higher power and do the right thing.|`|eW0MSS1uaa	Obama is probably already best friends with Blagojevich.|`|2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	I am not worried. No one believes he was born in kenya, and no one will believe Blagojevich over him.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Without evidence, Blagojevich's word is worth nothing now.|`|ohzPenCWaa	Then there will be a trial in which he has to prove that Obama was in the loop. Or Obama could easily sue for defamation There wouldnt be an indictment of Obama without due process.|`|V44ARW4maa	i don't think obama is all that concerned with that left wingnut, blago. The whole affair only serves to divert attention away from the economy, something that is sad. Republicans are indeed happy blago is  stirring the political pot. but he'll be gone soon.|`|AA11963685	Blago has no way to prove that.  If he has no proof, no one but Obama haters will believe him.  It's pretty hard to argue with tapes that show beyond doubt that Obama didn't play ball.  How would he make that fact go away while trying to claim Obama was in the loop with no evidence? Ignore that evidence, and just believe me while I stand here with no evidence.  Who would be dumb enough to buy that?|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Sweet.

You gotta love America.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Funny, but windows don't have hinges.

But, with the slobbering media, we will never hear anything goofy Obama does.
0V2HxKGZaa	With a screen name like voice of reason, one would figure the answer given might possibly make sense!  Go Figure.  This is not "sound policy" as voice of reason would have you beleive. Every single time the U.S. spends money without a product or a commodity backing that money, hyper inflation or a depression hits. To make it simple enough for voice of reason to understand, I will dumb down the next few comments signifigantly.  If we do what Obamatard and the libtards want, then we are going to have an economy just like when Cartertard was President. Does anyone remember the 21% inflation, fuel scarcity, energy shortages, and military funding cut so much that we could not even get a Sea Stallion off the ground without crashing it and killing all aboard? That is hyper inflation and it occurs when you have the treasury print money and you spend that money without getting any return on the money you spent.  There are more dollars available than goods which causes inflation to skyrocket.  Basic economic principle that in studied in high school about 20 years ago!!!!  So, if libtards want to brainwash conservatives or rewrite history so that their way actually works, go ahead.  Hoover tried to spend his way out of a recession and caused the Great Depression.  Carter tried to tax and spend his way out of a downward trending economy that was in decent shape when he got in office and that disaster is chronicled above.  Clinton is the only President that has ever taxed and spent and made it work. Why? because the administration was fiscally responsible.  History, however, still clearly demonstrates that cutting taxes and spending generates more revenues and positive economic outcome than tax and spend!!|`|pYRZcfsJaa	yes... he will blame the Republicans... then his sheep will start killing conservatives in the street... the conservatives will kill back... it'll be total chaos... anarchy... yea|`|v1a0PHdwaa	you say when but that's a kind of stupid statement   Keynesian economics will win out here as they did for years before Friedman came along and gave us an entirely unsustainable economic model that Reagan republicans grabbed onto and screwed the country with for 28 years, party's over and we're headed back toward SOUND policy|`|K9ooahTfaa	Yes.  He should have solved all the world problems by now.

How's that for a start?|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	When you are in combat and have to face the horrors of war it is not as simple as sitting here banging on keyboard.    When you come back to having people call you baby killer, you see women and children blown up in front of you.    Have people use children as cover.    Than when you shoot back you are call a war criminal.    It all takes its toll on someone.    BTW: If you look at the suicide rates for the nation there are places that have higher levels.    Be careful when  you quote statics.    Remember there are lies, damn lies an statics.|`|QC94lBXOaa	It's called PTSD and it is EXACTLY why we MUST take care of our soldiers before, during and after the battle. Veteran funding has been cut so much out of the federal budget it is an abomination and psychiatric care for veterans is almost non-existent. Every single man woman and child in this nation should be outraged at how we have shortchanged those who put their lives on the line. We owe them at LEAST that much.|`|AA11166769	Well, they more than likely have posttraumatic stress disorder, which often leads to suicidal behavior. I think that something should definitely be done to address the mental health issues of our military personnel.|`|9temsB8haa	HAve you ever faced the horrors of combat? It isnt whether they believe in the mission, the stress and fear can simply mess with some peoples minds.   The other part is that as a society we have gone overboard in convincing people that they cannot handle their problems.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Because they can't stand to report to Obama who dodged military service and hates them. And they know that all their sacrifice will be  wasted as Obama cowers to Arabs.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious condition. Once someone goes off to war, they are never the same again.     This is not only true of todays troops. Have you ever met someone from Vietnam? My step dad was in Nam for 2 years when he was 18-20. Those two years dominate his life. He's in his 60's now. He still can't shake the things he did and saw all those years ago. He still has intense  nightmares about his days there.|`|whE5OQ26aa	The Army takes ANYONE. Army, Marines, Navy I mean. I have literally had my mouth drop at some of the people they take.     That's the real problem with the armed forces. For every 1 decent person, there are 10 that you wouldn't trust walking your dog!     I worked with 3 people that went in the Marines. These people were bottom of the barrel. One of them said things that disturbed me. I will admit one thing, most of these people are screwed up before they went in, lol. There's another guy that's joining up. He's insane. Literally. I ran into a friend of mine who was with him in Wal-Mart, and he kept saying random things to the girlfriends of these thugs that would come in. Imagine what he'd do in combat...pretty much get me killed!    No wonder they make you a robot in the armed forces, you have to with the quality of people you get.|`|UslSmR0paa	well they have post traumatic stress disorder, which often leads to suicidal behavior. cause they remember of killings of Innocent people it haunts them, i think it will not stop.|`|VYtW0uRiaa	I am sure glad you are not one of them.You would get many killed with your rotten attitude.|`|ftbIWNydaa	It is a part of the life of war.|`|g5FbtzNTaa	Not to take away from the seriousness of the issue, if it weren't for the sissified policies implemented by the liberal establishments; boys/girls wouldn't be accepted into the military who were susceptible to mental degradation. There was once a time when these sorts would have been washed out. Anyone, civilian or military who contemplates suicide lacks certain mental stability. Boys and girls who enter into the armed forces should give sober and virtuous thought as to the reasons they are doing so. Those who do commit suicide are week links in a chain of valor and honor.

Also, halbrook made a great observation-divorce is high in the Military life. Marriage is one of the leading causes for depression for so many military personal. 73percent of most divorces are due to the long separation between deployments. When a solider is the HZ, they think of their wives and Kidd's to get through the long days and nights in a forging country. So its not hard to understand the problems military struggles with.

BLMh0dG6aa	? Its a theory, are you asking if people acting upon this theory are causing such problems.    From what I found about the theory on en.wikipedia.org it seemed a very inaccurate barometer of behavior, including many inaccuracies, and potentially racist and seemed to be made to justify some peoples going on with their own actions, and to justify their own pre-existing beliefs.    Their were some elements, such as recognizing states wishes to exist, which are lacking, but even these are coupled with broad assumption, including the assumption that all outside the U.S. are essentially sociopathic when threatened; and history has disproven this time and time again.
myfkN6wAaa	Probably because they are the ones who are pregnant?  I don't mean to be sarcastic, just simplistic Should "fathers" have to pay child support during the preganancy?    Edit:  hey, it's a legitimate question...if life begins at conception, should a pregnant woman be able to sue for child support? ...can you claim it on your taxes as a dependent?...how about receiving additional govt. aid on behalf of the unborn family member?  It's not so cut and dry.    Edit 2: I see your point and it's valid, but do you see how this one question opens up a set of entirely new ones? My point is that your question only addresses one angle of a very complex issue.|`|AA10465540	Men do not carry the fetus inside them for about nine months.  Men do not have their entire bodies rearranged and their hormones changed by the potential child.  Men do not give birth to the child, and quite a few men have very little to do with raising the child.  A man's opinion on abortion should be equal to his contribution to the conception, about five minutes of his time and a microscopic sperm cell.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	That's between the man and the woman, not the Government or the Evangilists.|`|KVBTtF9faa	I think because we're the ones who have to go  through the pregnancy or the abortion and deal with what comes afterward.    Let's look at two scenarios.    A.) The woman wants to keep the baby and the man does not. She will grow that baby in her and love it and raise it. If she and the man spilt up and (or because of) he wants her to abort the child, if she so chooses she either doesn't have to name him as the baby's daddy and that absolves him of having to pay child support or if she gets with someone else who wants to adopt the baby and raise it as his own the man can sign away his parental rights. Or of course, he'll have to pay child support or run the risk of being another dead beat dad.    B.) The woman wants the abortion and the man wants her to keep the baby. In this case, sadly the man doesn't have much sway because he's not the one going through the physical, mental, and emotional changes that occur during pregnancy and after the pregnancy the woman may not want to keep the baby but she may not want to hand it over to the father. Is this right? NO. Is there much that can be done about it? Probably not unless the man takes  the woman to court to sue for the rights to his child.     I do think men should be able to have more of a say!|`|DkwgogXZaa	that is very true. not an easy question to answer at all.  most guys that knock up a girl don't want it. in the event they do, there should be a legal proceeding to halt the abortion. barring that having the baby would cause the irreparable damage to the woman's body or health, the man should be forced to pay for all care, but the women should be compelled to have the child.|`|AA11166769	When it becomes medically possible for a man to carry a child, he can then have a say in the matter. Until then, though, he has no right to tell any woman what she can or can't do with her own body.|`|oobdNWdBaa	i dont agree with that. but women are the ones that have to go through that for 9 months and go through the worst pain of their life.|`|xagiOb80aa	The fetus is part of the mothers' body until it is born, therefore, only WOMEN should be able to dictate what happens to their bodies...|`|3jFm0rWdaa	As some people have correctly pointed out, half of the children aborted are male, so this is not a "women's rights" issue only.  For that matter the other half are female!  So how does abortion improve the lives of women again?|`|m5FyTeYgaa	In an ideal world the couple would be together making that decision. But, how many men even want to take responsibility for being the father?    If the guy goes screaming into the night at his girlfriend's mention of being late, then why should she have to consult him about an abortion? She HAS to make the decision, the guy can choose to be involved, but doesn't have to be.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	i would wager it has to do with it being their body and they are most likely to have to raise the begat.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	What makes you think the man doesn't agree with the woman?  &  One reason for an abortion is that the father left...|`|3ME7sBxjaa	Pretty much because it is their body.  They may not have the only say, just the final say.  Let's look at it as 51% of the vote on the issue.  --  The fetus lives and is connected to the woman's body.  An abortion occurs within her body.  When we say it is  the woman's body, it is.  She experiences the pregnancy and everything that comes with it.  He physically does not.|`|KcAehrrKaa	I'm pretty sure there are a couple of reasons, for one, they fear the pain of labour, another could be lack of concern, a third could be financial problems, a fourth, feeling undeserving, a fifth an embarrassment and shame for being pregnant.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Men have plenty of rights when it comes to fathering a baby. It's called "the condom". Or "just say no".     When a man can force a woman to abort a baby or force her to bear a child that she does not want to, then women have no rights.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	No, they can't make a baby on their own.  But, mostly when a women is considering an abortion it is because the "father" is not a "man" and cannot be trusted or relied upon.  Not too many women out there want to bring a baby into this world alone.|`|AA11963685	I think if a man wants a baby then he needs to convey that to his partner.  If not then he needs to take some responsibility and wear a condom.  When a man doesn't take part in the decision before he gets what he's after, and then thinks he should have a say in a resulting unwanted pregnancy after the fact I think he's more about controlling the woman than anything else.  It's her body.  He doesn't have to carry the child, and it's just a fact that in most cases he won't be the one whose work and private life is severely limited by caring for that child.      So no, I don't think a man who doesn't think about it beforehand then has a right to order the woman around who will be the main person to have to deal with it.  It's not his body.  If he feels differently, then he needs to pay more attention to the details of preventing a pregnancy before he lets the little head think for the big one.      I'm tired of men thinking they have the right to tell women what they can do with their bodies and their lives.  If the man truly wants that kid then he should tell the woman and take full responsibility for its upbringing, its care and its life and be willing to leave her out of it.  If she doesn't agree with going through pregnancy just to hand him a baby and then decamp then that's her choice, not his.  No man has the right to force a woman to put her body through all of that.  That's HER decision.  Her body, not his.    EDIT:  No, it isn't his body too because he donated some sperm.  He doesn't have to endure the pregnancy and he doesn't have to deal with what it does to the body or how it affects the woman's everyday life.  Her job, her relationships, her health.  That's a lame argument in my opinion, sorry.    EDIT:  Yes, you have it now.  Obviously you feel this isn't right.  Oh well, I have a hard time feeling sympathy for your stance.  If men took more responsibility BEFORE they get into bed they wouldn't have to worry about this would they?|`|AA11928155	cause row v wade said so. I am not for abortions but I would say that so many men walk away from the whole situation. They work under the table and hide out so they don't have to pay child support. So who is to say that once the child is born the man doesn't take off. There was a time when the couple would get married and have the child. Sadly many people have lost that morality.|`|G6QM0jVpaa	Because cruel liberals told them so.    But it is TWO PARENTS involved when it comes to child support, though...|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	How do you prove who the father is? You can't do that without a dna test and that would require a very invasive amnioscentesis procedure on a woman. (Which could harm the woman or the baby). The courts wouldn't enforce that. And no other person has the right to force you to have surgery or not. That's your choice. It comes down to the woman's medical privacy, and that's nobody's business but the patient and the doctor's.    EDIT: "Technically the baby is both the man's and the woman's body"?     Technically - No unless you can prove "who's man's body" - and just because the fetus shares the DNA, the technical fact still remains, that the fetus is inside the woman's body. Do you propose that a man should be able to cut open another human being to get rights to the dna inside? I guess people who donate organs should "own" that part of the other person too. No! That's ridiculous. Until it comes out of the body, it is in the woman's body. Period.    I'm personally against abortion, but no man will ever be able to have a say what I can or cannot do inside my own body. Heck no! Can I decide what you should do with stuff with in your body?    EDIT AGAIN: I think you do finally get it now. But guess what? The man does have a choice. He can choose to not have sex or use protection. It should be a given that the woman will contain the fetus inside her and he has no rights to tell her what she can or cannot do with her body. If a man doesn't want a baby, wrap it up, if he does, make sure the woman is against abortion. Problem solved.
c6097b009ec19a88b98eb36a0f98ffdcaa	I agree.  Obama has a good approach.  Over time, it will pay off for him.  He has done some things that make a lot of good sense, such as sitting with the House GOP for 2 hours yesterday.  At the House.  Has that ever happened before?  And with the GOP in the minority, and not needed to pass the bill at hand?  Great move.      It doesn't change the bill.  Its still a bad idea.  And Nancy Pelosi is still subverting most of Obama's goodwill gestures.      My Rep in the House, from Illinois, voted as his constituents wanted him to vote - against the 'stimulus' package.      Obama deserves recognition for his efforts in mending fences, and it will likely help the overall attitude in Washington.  I'm glad to see it.|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	I'll drink to that.

Obama knows that they cannot stand in the way of his stimulus bill and he feels confident it will work.     He still wants to work with them on other issues that are coming up including reforming Medicare and Social Security.     If he maintains good relationships with them, he fulfills one of his campaign promises, keeps them off- balance, and if and when the stimulus works, he knows they will rush to support him simply so they can claim they are behind the country's resurgence and love to work with our super popular President.|`|Dgwi0ztraa	after 8 yrs. of serving water and no smoking. the cocktails and some clandestine cigarettes are the change that obama promised.

AA11938332	Unions in the past have all been a good thing for the working people. Right now, they are nothing but a bunch thugs who take union dues, tell their rank and file who they should vote for, and give people who will do them some good, money to run for office.    Any time a union supports someone, its a good chance there is a "deal" worked out for votes.    I worry about the unions holding industry hostage like the auto makers. Heck, who wouldn't want to retire, get their regular pay and all the perks for life. Only problem is, it costs the auto makers money and they pass that on to the people who buy their cars.

That special interest group winds up in control of union dollars, and if the union leaders are all leftists, then they wind up being a problem.

However, there are several Republican backed Unions as well, but pukes don't tell you about them now, do they?  Who do you think prison guards vote for? it sure isn't Democrats. Prison guards want job security as much as anyone else and the only way they can get it is through phony "tough on crime" schemes designed to imprison people for things such as smoking marijuana and then turn around and market the same drugs on the streets of America.  The Reagan administration OKed peddling crack on the streets of LA to fund covert activities then turned right around and pushed tough drug legislation so they could spend billions to build private "for profit prisons" all around America. The same prisons "employ" millions of inmates working for industries in even high tech fields, but when these inmates are released they never get a referral for a good work record in prison even if they were the best ever seen in industry. I have a friend who learned data entry in prison and can type around 170 wpm, but once released he couldn't get a job in data entry because of his record. it was perfectly fine when he worked for .10 cents per hour, but once on the outside his skills were no longer needed at any kind of higher rate so he turned back to crime and back in the slave labor system at 10 cents an hour.  Republicans back unions, but only those who safeguard their private slave labor camps..  Stuff slave labor in your republican pipe and smoke that.|`|i2M7lyPgaa	The unions supply the votes, the libs in the government supply the kickbacks and paybacks.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Most Government agencies are Unionized.

G4TJ8nibaa	You don't. Your mother-in-law has to do it all herself.    Hosting Visitors to the U.S.    People often ask how they can help a family member, relative or friend get a visa to visit them in the United States. We appreciate their desire to help and do understand that sometimes the need for a visit can be urgent.    Under U.S. law, however, applicants for visitor visas must qualify on their own for visas to visit the United States.    This is what applicants must do to qualify for visitor visas:    Complete and sign the required application forms;  Bring evidence that their visit is temporary and that they will return home after their legally authorized stay; and  Undergo security clearance procedures  We understand that you may want to help with the visa process. However, it does not help the applicant if you write a letter of invitation or personally guarantee his or her departure from the United States after the visit is over. The consular officer evaluates each visa application on its own merits according to visa law and procedures. You can be most helpful by making sure the applicant has all the information they need to submit a correct application and by explaining fully the standards for visa issuance.

jh9iPYvXaa	Let me see if I understand. You were shot in the head - presumably NOT by your ex-wife. You're entitled to some compensation, and she's claiming that she'll get half if you don't divorce her?    Actually, she might be entitled to half anyway. Talk to your lawyer. And if she wants to go that badly, let her go.... so much for "in sickness and in health." Save your love for someone who DESERVES it.|`|LgKYrup2aa	All sorts of things fly around during the divorce process. Much of it is threats and bluffs  -  but some of it isn't.    However, if you are due a compensation payment and still married - she could claim a percentage.    Decide what YOU want. What's YOUR plan?. Where is YOUR future?    Then consult with your lawyer  -  tell him what you want. Ask him for his opinion on her claim.      When one side says a relationship is over  -  its over.    Refusing to give a divorce doesn't really help you in anyway.    It's just emotion expressed as belligerance.    It's understandable that you have all sorts of emotions  -  but try to channel them into gaining the outcome you want  -  rather than trying to block her.    Good luck.    >>|`|WrDGhduxaa	If  you live in a community property state she is entitled to half of your money if she divorces you.

0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Welcome to the USA!    As for why we normally have only one officer to a vehicle...    Police have been undermanned for many years. Taxpayers are already overburdened enough and collecting more taxes for police or otherwise is always an unpleasant task for the government.    Placing one officer per vehicle enables law enforcement to be seen in more places with two cars having one officer per car than one car with two officers.|`|wg78UkxFaa	It all comes down to funds and there not being enough to be able to put two officer per patrol car out on the street.      So they place one officer per vehicle which does put them at a greater risk.  But at the same time we do have more patrol cars out on our streets, so therefore it does make for a greater show of force as there are more out and about.      Patrol cars are also equipped with camera that record any incidents that happen during their shift, when ever a stop is made.  That is another set of eyes that does not lie as to what may or may not have happened during a stop or incident.    I hope this helps answer your question.  God bless!|`|ohUm00RYaa	Well our cops can drive well and they patrol areas.  Low crime areas have fewer cops and high crime areas have more cops.  So in a high crime area you might have 8 patrol cars on 4 blocks but odds are that 4-5 cops can get to that other cop in last than 2 minutes.  so you see thats more effective than having 2 cops togethr.  For example, a criminal tries to run away down a street where 2 cops are coming at him but he can't even see them.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	So they can spread out and help out a large area. There aren't that many of them compared to what they protect.  Yes they carry guns and yea some people here are violent, in fact in some areas, it's so violent that the police DO travel in twos (such as south Chicago).  Plus it's better to have two cars with a cop in each chasing a guy than two cops in one car.  And, how much more fun is it to have your very own cop car! No sharing involved lol.

6CmaAS4Laa	My feeling is you can take what most of these kool aid drinkers know about economics, tie it together and shove it up a ant's behind and it will rattle around like a BB in a boxcar.    You are asking a question that Limbaugh has raised on his show and I suspect that is why you are asking it here. Limbaugh says Obama did lose. The left will spin it to a win. The truth does seem to be that Obama wanted bi-partisan support and did not get it so in that way he lost.    As to tax and spend, anyone who does not understand how taxcuts stimulate the economy in real ways over government spending is an obvious graduate of a government school.|`|BJhOd2usaa	No, the Republicans lost, because it was clear that they were going to stick to the old partisan way of doing things and try to block needed legislation.    To answer your question, a stimulus package works becuase you *don't* tax that dollar.    EDIT -- Essentially, the government prints money and then borrows the money from itself. It doesn't cost anything, it's just paper. In a normal economy, that would cause inflation, but in a recession the pressures are deflationary. So printing, borrowing, and spending the money prevents a deflationary spiral and increases demand, which puts people back to work.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	On the contrary.  He reached out in a bipartisan manner and the stubborn Republicans have painted themselves into a corner.  President Obama had nothing to lose in this encounter. If the stimulus plan fails, the blame would have gone to him and the Democrats in any case.  If the plan is a success, the Republican votes will be remembered. The Republicans won't have a prayer after that.     The Republican plan for tax cuts will not stimulate the economy.  Tax cuts never have done so and never will.|`|otYOxmnuaa	11 smart and bold Democrats voted against it too.    Thumbs down?

But in another year, I doubt it will be seen as much of a win, either.|`|AA10691226	Be careful; your bitterness is showing!    Let's explain it to you.    The US economy has been on steriods since WWII. It depends on excessive spending by consumers or the activity level will dry up. The most responsible thing to do would be to move to a better base than fossil fuels (auto industry and oil consumption) to drive it, but that requires retraining massive numbers of people, investment in the infrastructure and somehow keeping the legacy (old) system marginally alive in the meantime.    So the stimulus should goose spending while investing in retraining for weaning off the auto/oil dependency.    Get it?    Oh, and the government doesn't get money from taxing us anymore; we ran out of money long ago for that. It's borrow and spend at this point.|`|Bk09TO3vaa	He didn't lose, but he didn't pass with flying colors!|`|HZy629kLaa	No.  Bill passed, therefore, he won.|`|c6097b009ec19a88b98eb36a0f98ffdcaa	$100 lb?

I heard otherwise, but thanks for the updated information.|`|AA11193401	wonder who the libs will blame this on if the stimulus bill don't work|`|xXhkRq0Caa	President Obama did tried to appease the Republicans. This is no time to choose sides or let egos rule either party. America is in dire straits, people are losing their retirement, homes, jobs and dignity. I too am affected by this terrible economy. However, I want what's best for all. I might not get everything I want, but as long as I have the things I need I can live with that for now. So I will wait for the stimulus package at least it is a start to recovering the economic downfall.|`|0V2HxKGZaa	I do not support the bill because it will not work!  $275 mil in tax cuts for those that are already employed and the rest of the $819 mil is a massive spending bill -  not stimulus!  The Republicans unless on one of the two committees that had closed meetings to craft this bill, were COMPLETELY shut out of the process.  If Obama want to hold meetings with Republicans for the implied purpose of fostering bipartisanship, then he would talk to the libtards who apparently do not have any intention of allowing any alternatives to be mentioned or considered!  The liberal partisanship was bad in the Congress.  Wait for this bill to hit the Senate where the majority is far more pronounced.

iIkJN4Suaa	What - the 23 we already have aren't enough!|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	what is the difference between a legal immigrant or an illegal alien?  They are both taking jobs from Americans. They are both having anchor babies, they are both using welfare.  The legal immigrant is paying taxes, the illegal MAY be paying taxes.  The chances of either one becoming a citizen are slim, not because there isn't opportunity, but because that isn't why they came.    They came for the benefits they could get from the government. We currently have a guest worker program. About 40% do not leave the US when the visa expires and become illegal. So I Say again what is the difference.|`|NQq7xykxaa	A work visa program should be tied to the fence being completed and the border secured, then we should issue work visa's to those who get jobs here and if they like they can apply for citizenship if they like, the fence and border security are vital though to help slow the flow of drugs, as it is now they just backpack them up to safe houses and distribute them from there and we must get control of that situation.|`|jg2nGhNHaa	In my home I can only have a few guests at a time.  If they never leave I don't have room for more.  Right now the US seems to be busting at the seams with guests who have becomve squatters.  How about we get them to go home first before we start thinking of letting more in, at this point it looks as if the guests are flowing over into our neighbors houses and yards.
UvzKiis0aa	Tax cuts don't work.  It's how we got where we are.  Poor people use the money to pay bills and buy food.  The rich either sock it away or take it offshore.      The country needs to reinvest in infrastructure, put people to work.  We need to use tariffs on foreign made products and tax the heck out of corporations who fire all their American workers and manufacture their products in some third world country but then try to peddle their crap here.  The USA was bleeding jobs and not creating any more throughout Bush's presidency and all the GOP did was give more tax cuts.  Now they trot out the same tired song and dance that didn't work.      TAX CUTS DIDN'T WORK!!!  It caused the boom, bubble, bust cycle we saw in the Real Estate market.|`|mkEGjlmNaa	If you take less money away from people then they will have more to use.    I realize this is a difficult concept for the tax and spend party to grasp|`|Souvww0maa	Tax cuts on income alone will not do the job.    Tax cuts needs to be done in a multi-pronged fashion:    1)  Cut corporate taxes to 15% (from 35%).  This will cause businesses to invest in new projects and hire new people, increase capital spending, etc.    2)  Cut Capital Gains taxes.  This will fuel new investment.    3)  Cut income taxes.    These three things combined would light a fire under the economy and get it going.    My Stimulus bill would require just a few lines, where as the Congressional stimulus bill runs hundreds of pages, is 88% pork, and will NOT stimulate the economy.  Mine however, will, at no cost to the tax payers.  It would also have the treasury coffers overflowing.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Cap gains tax cuts and tax cuts to businesses would go a long way at helping the economy.|`|AA11702773	Cutting regulations strangling small business so they can produce jobs, and instead regulating the Fed and treasury would help, as well.|`|AA12203329	No...but restructuring the tax system would...say ...maybe a FLAT TAX!|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Tax cuts have been shown before to have little effect, if any, on the economy.  In the first place, they are usually quite small to most taxpayers.  If I get to keep $50 or $100 more a month, how much of a stimulus is that to me?  In addition, the people needing the money the most are often in a bracket that pays no taxes, so a cut doesn't help them at all.  The people gaining the most money from a tax cut are those who need the money the least.  In addition, George Bush cut taxes three times in his first two years in office.  Did that help?      Business tax cuts to small businesses would help some, but the largest corporations pay little if any taxes, so it would be moot for them.  And don't go on about the highest corporate tax rate stuff, since it exists only on paper.  If a tax isn't collected, is it a tax?|`|AA11103371	No.  But they certainly help.      The poor would spend the money immediately.    The middle class is going to sock the money away or pay down debt.    The rich don't care one way or another.      We have to create jobs to stimulate the economy.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	what economy..|`|k6hicodfaa	What good would a tax cut be if I don't have a job to get taxed on?|`|AA11518835	Tax cuts will only work if government spending is reduced by the amount of the cuts. Otherwise, our government will continue to drive us into debt.    And people, most likely, will spend the money that they don't pay taxes on.     Then again, when the government sends them a check in the mail as part of a stimulus, they will be more likely to save it, or do what I do- invest in foreign banks...|`|AA10264185	I know that I am going to use whatever I can in this years tax return to pay down debt. The people who are out of work would probably see some infrastructure projects than tax cuts for the rich.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	One problem with tax cuts is that it takes up to 6 months to get the money to the people.    Another is that the less money someone has, the more likely they are to spend the extra money. But tax cuts that target the wealthy will give little or no benefit to the economy, because these people already have everything they need.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	No, the only thing that will help "stimulate" the "economy" is for government to STOP taxation without representation, STOP over regulating, STOP expanding government, STOP increasing the deficit, STOP cow-towing to terrorists, STOP trying to disarm hardworking US citizens, Stop all sources of propaganda especially the mainstream media, Stop enacting laws based upon so-called religious doctrine, Stop the so-called UN from gaining control over the USA, and most importantly Stop the government from doing anything other than protecting US citizens from foreign and domestic aggressors...|`|QYXij5Wcaa	No, employment must be brought up and banks have too stabilize their lending policies.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Tax cuts by itself will not.    Job creation most certainly will.|`|Ry61ViNZaa	What surely will not stimulate the economy will be tax increases on individuals and small business as when you steal their money to give it to those that feel they are entitled to it with out working for it nobody wins.    And when Obama said the other day that he wants to immediately create 500,000 government jobs to work on green energy, that is just increasing the size of the government and creating a bigger tax burden on the middle class.    Let the private sector keep more of their profits and they then can reinvest in themselves and that's what creates real goods and services and jobs!|`|7249a41e7f2dea23630b309a1113bce6aa	I am going to try to get my family out of debt and stay there.  So, if the Federal govt.  gives me money...tax money that I gave them already as a loan, to me as a freebie that the govt. will have to pay that loan back later with my tax money again....ugh it's getting all convoluted...    Ok.  give me money and I'll spend it on my bills or my wife will spend it on the house or her self.    Others have said no...there is no way.|`|ael7j8koaa	Yes, it will.  The thing to do at a time like this is cut taxex, on EVERYBODY.  The poor, the middle class, the rich, small businesses, big businesses etc...    The worst thing to do now is to borrow and spend, which is exactly what Obama's plan calls for.|`|ftbIWNydaa	Gas prices added.|`|AA12031033	7 billion dollar bailout...should have been split between the American citizens. Mortgages would have been paid, banks would have got their money. More people would have spent money, bought cars, paid for the one they have, paid credit card bills. Banks still would have got their money. Spending would have kept the economy going in turn unemployment would have gone down and jobs would have went up. Us Government, just stupi to give away al that money to again be wasted by the idiots who started the depression to begin with. Give away unregulated money by the billions, give it to all the hard working Americans instead of the one who think there millions a year and leisure jets aren't enough!  Oh, and get rid of all the illegals sucking us dry too!|`|4qmzZ9s6aa	It works better than spending money by giving it to powerful people that use it for their own vises...i.e. AIG and the English Spa trips....if you put some cash in our pockets by giving us a tax break we will have to spend it....we have bills to pay, clothes to buy for our kids, food to put in their mouths, that we struggle to do now.    What pisses me off most about this whole deal is the fact that I have met so many people that  are for Obama walking around with all kinds of bling while their children are shoeless running around in rags!!! Yeah Bush gave out the first package and it failed miserably, what makes anyone think that just because Obama is doing it that it will work any better this time!!!     We are in this situation because of the degradation of the ideal of personal responsibility!! Pay your bills first and worry about what you WANT afterward!!!! What you NEED comes first!!! We went crazy as a nation with over-inflated home prices....I know, I'm in the business....people were paying 300,000 for a home that was worth 100,000 and we did it for 10+ years.....we ALL knew what would happen when the **** hit the fan!!! Those 300,000 dollar homes are now worth about 80.000K!!!!!!!!!  The federal Government started this by trying to help those who could not afford to buy a home buy one. When you give your government that much power of regulation you open the door wide for those iddividuals that will use that regulation to get rich off of the backs of the people the government meant to help. Less government regulation allows for true economic growth, the way it is set up to work. If you want our economy back to steady slow growth, we have to get Washington out of it!! Can anyone say kickback?   Take a poll of our Senators and Representatives and see how many of THEM are struggling like you are!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9d324139a59bc1e69bcfeb3145f249efaa	Yes and no, yes they will spend the money in that they will be paying off debts but that will not stimulate the economy since that is technically money that's already been spent, and no, money not spent on paying off debts will most likely go into savings, again not stimulating the economy since the economic health is measured by money in circulation not by money in banks.  Estimates on Bush's tax rebate last year suggest that only about 15% of it went towards spending that actually helped the economy and things are worse now.  To stimulate the economy people have to buy things, which in turn generate jobs so that people can buy more, and so on.  No jobs means no people with money to spend so more people lose their jobs making things worse.  Granted, this an egregious oversimplification of some very complex economic issues, but that's it in a nutshell.

The government can't keep putting in a trillion dollars every couple of months to hide this fact, printing fake currency followed by hyperinflation and 20% interest rates have now become inevitable.

GOOD NEWS  - getting into college should not be a problem.

Becoming a citizen of the United States is a privilege, its not a right!  When you are in a country that your not a legal citizen of its never a good idea to commit any type of crime.  We already have enough criminals in our country, believe me our prisons are up to the rafters and beyond as it is.  So, no we do not need more people coming into our country and commiting crimes, there are enough criminals as it is.    You talk about all of the hard work that you did in high school, and was it all a waste.  Its a little late in the day to be worrying about wasting your hard work now isn't it?  The time to have thought about all of your hard work was before you did criminal acts, not after.    You and only you made the choices that you made, choices that you didn't seem to mind when you were doing them.   Ask your self and be totally honest, how much longer would you have been stealing from peoples cars if you hadn't been caught?  I really think you'd still be doing it, if you hadn't been stopped.    You have to take owner ship for what you did to all of those people, remember that you stole from them they didn't steal from you.  Stop crying about all the hard work that you did and about now how you feel like it was all wasted.  Because you were the one who threw it away, no one else but you did that to you.    God bless you that you will do better by your self as well as others from now on.|`|jhlUCgCHaa	don't drop the soap|`|ZwJxY6TDaa	You should be worried..

Be that as it may, Republicans hold many seats by convincing many to vote against their own self-interest by pandering to the 'Gods Guns and Gays' issues crowd.

Go ahead and do it and then the republicans will win the majority back in the house and senate because they didn't vote to pass another $1.17 trillion dollars on to the future of this country.  The $1.17 trillion is the real cost of the "stimulus" package when you add in how much interest there will be to pay it back.  Redecorating the White House, parks, buying new government cars, paying for STD'S and abortions, building new government buildings and remodeling old ones will not stimulate this economy.  John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan knew the real way to stimulate the economy.  The Republicans are only following their example.  I personally called all my reps and insisted that they do not vote for this package, it will only hurt America as well as hundreds of thousands of other citizens did.

Just think how much that would cut back the size of government by getting rid of these agencies !|`|AZtlB3VMaa	I don't think removing welfare would solve our problems, especially in the economic state we are currently in. It is true that some people completely abuse welfare and make it their "baby's daddy," but that doesn't meant that it works that way for everybody. Welfare is very beneficial to a lot of people who work hard but still need that added help. Many blue collar job workers, such as janitors, farmers, and those that do all those jobs that other people would never want, need that money because they aren't making it at their jobs.     As for programs like Medicaid, without that program many people would die. Some people (mainly the ones with those jobs I was talking about earlier) don't get any medical benefits and cannot afford any type of healthcare. Medicaid is the only thing that keeps people from dying or being incredibly in debt due to medical bills.     So unless the government wants to start paying the hard working lower class better rather than the suit wearing executives that do half as much, I think welfare should stay in business.      =) Maybe this will help you see welfare from a different perspective?|`|3s59vsLNaa	First of all, we should stop separating the government from the people.  Anyway, "all or most" to one does not actually mean ALL or MOST as in a universal truth.  Universal truths tend to not work when trying to apply it to people.      How to reason... Perhaps a cruel mind may see that if America wants a pool of unfortunate people to use, which seems to be a cruel part of the economic system, it has to keep them somewhat nourished in case they need them.  Potential military recruits to janitorial/job-no-one-else-wants, "they" are people who are easily manipulated, without an actual education that we, "the people," the government, fail to give them.  If you don't have as cruel of a mind then, perhaps, welfare should inspire getting education while getting it to get it.  Reform!    Not condoning such a give-and-take system that is had now but it's better than the only other alternative suggested here.  There are people who are actually trying to make it--a lot not lazy!  We can't cut those who want to succeed off, many of those people who have children who get hungry.

Obama is the dumbest person we have ever had as President.      First off, a stimulus is expected to stimulate the economy NOW.  Not, a year from now or 3 years from now.  His so-called stimulus is said to start to stimulate in 2010.  The recession could be over by then.  Everything he has done in the last week and a half in office is hogwash.      His stimulus plan isn't getting voted on because it is bursting at the seams with PORK.  Didn't I hear him say in the debates that he was going to go "Line for line" through the budget and cut back on spending? And just a few months later, he's wanting to add $1 trillion to our debt ( I mean our Grand, Great, and GreatGrandkids debt).  Did you know that it takes 31 years, I said 31 years to count out loud 1 to 1 trillion if you start now.  And I said 31 years.  How long does it take to pay back $1 trillion? 62 years??? I don't think any economist knows.      But some of the Democrats way of thinking is it's just another trillion added to our already $10 trillion we owe.  What's another trillion? Some people kill me.      So what would his excuse for all this spending be? Perhaps he didn't know how bad the economy was when he was running? Please, this man is a disgrace to anyone with any brains.  Including those that voted for him.      To all those that are scared, you should be... Obama studied Marxism and is a believer in Socialism just like Pelosi and Reed.  Big government doesn't work.  Do you want Pelosi in charge of your job??? She can't even talk or think, much less run something.       I helped Saxby get re-elected this year, just so he would stop what Obama wanted to do.

Their style is not to cooperate with Democrats, not to work in a bipartisan fashion.  They wouldn't cooperate with Clinton either, but spent his whole time in office accusing him of just whatever crime they could think of and investigating these crimes.  With Obama, they want very badly to blame the recession on him, and they can't do that if they help him.  They want the recession to get worse, not better, so they can use it against him in 2012.    The idea of spending to rise out of recession is called Keynesianism, after John Maynard Keynes, a very influential economics expert early in the previous century.  Keynes said that govts. should put money by when times are good, so when they're bad they can put people to work, get money circulating in the economy, etc.  But the Republicans spent us into huge debt when the economy was good, by increasing spending and cutting taxes. So now that the economy is suffering, we don't have that cushion to fall back on.

Many issues that I study don't directly affect my life...abortion being one of them having never had an abortion. However these issues DO have an effect on society as a whole and so as a member of society...they effect me indirectly.    You have the right AND responsibility, as a member of society to inform yourself and vote your dictates.    The issue where many women get stuck is the idea that abortion is an "intimate" issue concerning the body. Similarly, people that want to have the right to "die with dignity" when they have serious illnesses also feel that the government shouldn't tell them what they can and can't do with their bodies.    I am a conservative, however I am a pro-choice advocate provided:  1. it is limited to the first term  unless  1. it is medically necessary to save the mother  2. it is the result of incest or rape    my position however has little to do with the rights of mother and unborn and more to do with completely inadequate care AFTER the child is born. Women are forced into poverty in staggering numbers if they keep the baby and the foster system is rampant with abuse if they choose to adopt instead. Until a humane option is readily available to women, 1st term abortion should be an option....in my opinion.|`|kVTryKlBaa	I not a lib, but yeah I think every man should have some say in it.  if she keeps the child, you sure have a pay in it.|`|AA10928202	We should all have a say in preventing murder.

Just as long as you understand that Roe vs. Wade occurred in 1973, and as a result, abortion is legal in the United States. What happens with a woman and her body is up to that woman.

You're religion might give you an opinion, but in regards to the law it is not supposed to be involved.     I would say that if you were the potential father then you deserve to give your opinion on the matter, but in the end its completely up to the girl what she wants to do.     In the end ,this is a case where abortion will never be eliminated unless religion takes over the country. At that point America will have become the exact opposite of  what it was supposed to be in the first place when people left Europe to avoid religious persecution.|`|2b3ihDVuaa	I'll admit that those responses are invalid.  If you were involved in the pregnancy you do have some limited rights.  If you just oppose abortions, you have a right to your opinion; but no right to interfere with a particular abortion.|`|5wdPKphVaa	Yes, of course you have the right to your own opinion and voice. But why don't you look at it from a woman's perspective? You're not the one who would be forced to carry an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy in your body for 9 months. And more likely than not, you wouldn't be the one ending up caring and raising the child alone with no assistance. It's only logical that the person who would be affected the most would have more of a say about what should happen.    If you are concerned about your partner having an abortion and you not having a say, my response to that is that if abortion is an issue for you, then you should not be sleeping or having unprotected sex with anyone other than a stable partner who shares your own views on abortion.     And comparing abortion to child abuse is manipulative and disingenuous. Child abuse is an illegal crime, abortion is a legal and safe medical procedure which causes no scientifically proven harm to any living human being. And you call others "rationally bankrupt"?

EW9wU5Nlaa	The Republicans happen to have a better idea than the wasteful spending bill they rejected.    It will cost $478 billion and it will put money into the hands of Americans directly and immediately in the following ways:    * Cut the lowest two income tax rates for 2009 and 2010, from 15 percent to 10 percent and from 10 percent to 5 percent.    * Extend through 2010 a patch to the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was originally designed to ensure that wealthy people pay taxes, but instead would hit millions of middle-income families with higher taxes.    * Expand the $7,500 first-time homebuyers tax credit for a principal residence to all homebuyers while limiting it to purchasers who can make a down payment of at least 5 percent of the purchase price.    * Provide a tax deduction for small businesses with less than 500 employees equal to 20 percent of their income.    * Offer new tax deduction for those who do not receive tax-preferred, employer-sponsored health care coverage. And provide assistance to the unemployed who do not qualify for a COBRA premium subsidy.    * Give tax exemption on unemployment benefits and extend temporary federal unemployment benefits through 2009, phasing it out through mid-2010.    * Allow companies to write off current losses against previous tax years for up to five years. Companies now can only "carry back" losses for two years. The tax break would not be available to banks and other companies receiving help from the $700 billion bailout package.    * Extend through 2009 a break for small businesses that allows them to immediately write off up certain capital expenditures.

Remember, we're only talking about the House Republicans so far, about 170 people who by definition share some similar ideas on the issues they are voting on.     You are wise not to take anything that happens in politics at face value, but in this instance I don't think there is any real conspiracy. This stimulus package bill is supposed to spend money on programs that will aid and encourage businesses to expand and create jobs, so more people can spend money and support the businesses. But the bill is full of billions of dollars of 'earmarks' to give money to government programs that do not directly contribute to this goal, but which will aid many key Democrats with their special interest groups who in turn will aid them in their reelection bids next year - which, not by coincidence, is when the bill specifies that most of this money will begin being payed out.     I'm cynical enough to think that some Republicans would have supported this bill if they personally were going to get something out of it, but they aren't.

It is hard to believe that their constituents contacted them and let them know what they thought.    Maybe they found this to be appalling    A Dozen Fun Facts About the House Democrats' Massive Spending Bill    1. The House Democrats' bill will cost each and every household $6,700 additional debt, paid for by our children and grandchildren.    2. The total cost of this one piece of legislation is almost as much as the annual discretionary budget for the entire federal government.    3. President-elect Obama has said that his proposed stimulus legislation will create or save three million jobs. This means that this legislation will spend about $275,000 per job. The average household income in the U.S. is $50,000 a year.    4. The House Democrats' bill provides enough spending - $825 billion - to give every man, woman, and child in America $2,700.    5. $825 billion is enough to give every person living in poverty in the U.S. $22,000.    6. $825 billion is enough to give every person in Ohio $72,000.    7. Although the House Democrats' proposal has been billed as a transportation and infrastructure investment package, in actuality only $30 billion of the bill - or three percent - is for road and highway spending. A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office said that only 25 percent of infrastructure dollars can be spent in the first year, making the one year total less than $7 billion for infrastructure.    8. Much of the funding within the House Democrats' proposal will go to programs that already have large, unexpended balances. For example, the bill provides $1 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which already have $16 billion on hand. And, this year, Congress has plans to rescind $9 billion in highway funding that the states have not yet used.     9. In 1993, the unemployment rate was virtually the same as the rate today (around seven percent). Yet, then-President Clinton's proposed stimulus legislation ONLY contained $16 billion in spending.    10. Here are just a few of the programs and projects that have been included in the House Democrats' proposal:    $650 million for digital TV coupons.  $6 billion for colleges/universities - many which have billion dollar endowments.  $166 billion in direct aid to states - many of which have failed to budget wisely.  $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.  $400 million for "National Treasures."  11. Almost one-third of the so called tax relief in the House Democrats' bill is spending in disguise, meaning that true tax relief makes up only 24 percent of the total package - not the 40 percent that President-elect Obama had requested.    12. $825 billion is just the beginning - many Capitol Hill Democrats want to spend even more taxpayer dollars on their "stimulus" plan.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Because it is a bad bill.    Obama does not need one single Republican vote in order to pass any verison of the stimulus bill he wants.

Remember they would gladly sacrifice our elderly and poor just to one up the president when it comes time for the next set of elections!    They made their point.  Screw the elderly and the poor so the Republicans can say we beat Obama.  This was the second time their united no vote was aimed at the poor and the elderly, let us not forget the DTV vote.    As someone said what goes around comes around and the Republicans and their anti-elderly anti-poor votes will be brought up in the next election cycle.    So, Brandie you are saying since they never voted for the Republicans they can be run over by the party in their votes? You just made my point for me!

Republicans are playing a political game.  They want it to appear as though Democrats are steamrolling over them, even though Obama spoke about bipartisanship.  Since they know Obama did engage them for their input, they've turned on Nancy Pelosi and have made her into the partisan villain.

They did it to the Democrats from 2002 through 2006, to the detriment of the country.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	The real issue is that the entire Bill has no accountability and no controls to make sure the money is used the way it was intended.      The Bailout Bill 2, version 1.0 is a lot like a blank check with no signature required.      Several Democrats voted against the bill also because it is what their constituents demanded (that's who voted them in).     I think that if the Obamabots want to force this bill through they need to revamp the whole thing where it will be an actual bill that will help someone.    In stead of asking about this, we need to be asking why they already appropriated 750 Billion, there is less than 300 Billion of it left, and not one job has been saved, not one mortgage has been saved, not one foreclosure has been stopped, and not one lost home was redeemed.  That was a total failure and I for want don't want to see it again.      This is absolutely not the "change" we voted for.  We voted for Change, not "bait and switch".
04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	To the above answer:    Only history will give a fair trial...    First of all, Radovan Karadzic has not be sentenced. The entire issue is if we will be getting a  fair trial. From the sentences so far and from the Hague attitude, it does not seem so.    The war in Bosnia had been created by USA and Germany who pushed the Bosnian Muslims into war. Prior to that, the Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs had reached a peace agreement. This agreement was turned down by Alija Izetbegovic who had a meeting with Warren Zimmerman. Germany played its role with heavy diplomatic involvement which we may call "political crime". The media manipulation was used as a weapon of war. It did not turn you into buying cheap peanuts, but created a Serbophobic mass of voters and Yahoo Answer opinionators. This link will give you the picture:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHp_0SxT...    USA needed the war in Bosnia for appeasing their political games in the Middle East.    The braking of Bosnia was unconstitutional, but all the Serbs wanted was to remain where they were, with the Muslims going anywhere they had wanted. Since the Muslims, who found themselves backed by Islamic countries (lets not forget Turkey), Germany and USA, the Muslims chewed the bate and the Serbs said "if you want war you will get war!!!!".    In the Bosnian civil war all sides where cruel to each other. Wars are wars. Lets never forget that those who create and fuel wars are guiltier than those who shoot to survive. Lets look at world history and realize who Germany and USA are in the big picture against Russia. Who are some backyard Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Serbs to them? The big picture was crushing that remainder of Yugoslavia and its backbone Serbia.    Pilot question: Who were the first countries to recognize Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo...?    The Bosnian Serbs were militarily stronger. They had weapons which the Yugoslav Army left them when retreating to Serbia. Lets not forget that Yugoslavia used to be the fifth world power back around the beginning of the 1980ies. The USA and German strategy was to drain the Serbs until surrender. They used the Bosnian Muslims as carnage The Serbs resisted much longer, until NATO started using airplanes.    The outcome was that Bosnian Muslims obtained much less than if they had accepted the Jose Cutileiro peace treaty. They lost territory and they lost 60,000 to 30,000 Serbs. The Bosnian war took just under 100,000 victims. Look at what is Bosnia today. The only reason Serbs are not heading independence is because Bosnia is an artificial country under EU, and the political constellation would not allow them.    The media manipulation undertaken was a direct creator and escalator of the war. The journalists who worked under CNN Sarajevo were direct perpetrators of death. The Arch Devil is Christiane Amanpour.  The Serbs were portrayed as the only guilty in the war. Cases like Srebrenica, Markale, Vase Miskina, the Sarajevo and Tuzla Airport smuggling of arms under UN control, Roy Gutman, etc. were all around during the Bosnian war. That link above tells you everything.    UN was heavily manipulated under political crime. It was following NATO orders more than being a mediator. Their leader were being removed when not suitable to NATO any more. There were few good ones, but too few. One was LEWIS MacKENZIE. Take notice of the actual case concerning the UN Dutch Battalion at Srebrenica.    The Hague Court is a political court. It is run by the actors of the Bosnian war. It has shown to be biased against Serbs, not so against Croats and completely in protection of Bosnian Muslims (and Kosovo Albanians afterward with the same actors: Germany and USA.) The Bosnian Muslims are the "official victims" and Serbs are "official guilty".    Hey, take a look at this link concerning Hague Court and Kosovo Albanians:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcJRxLIyj...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3x0zY_ae...    The Hague Court is heavily manipulated and does not serve justice.    So how can you judge someone who was a leader of hundreds of thousands of people seeking justice, and not judge them all in a fair trial? What did Radovan Karadzic do that was so different than what Izetbegovic, Avdic, Boban did? Are you following that trial at all, listening to what he has to say?    How can you judge others after having swallowed all that crap that has been served to you by Ruder Fin?    Ratko Mladic is hunted for the Srebrenica event. Venture yourself into an answer of mine on that issue:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Good luck.|`|DyeKk9HKaa	First of all The Hague is one big political misconception that caters to countries with big bank accounts and denies political enemies and countries who are not members of the UN and NATO. Lets go back to whenever NATO and the United States under Clinton were applying pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to release all ties with Bosnia, a country that consisted of more than half Serbian occupants at one time. Bosnia was receiving large amounts of Saudi and Arab terrorist money as well as Croatian, German, American, and UN aide to kill and destroy anything Serbian. Why weren't cowards Like Franjo Tudjman, Alija Izetbegovic, Madeline Albreit, Bill Clinton, and all who help fund the war against innocent unarmed Serbian people throughout Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo tried at The Hague? Because of the constant media bashing of Serbia and her people. All people saw throughout the nineties was how the Croats and Bosniaks were the innocent victims and the Serbs were blood thirsty murderers hell bent on destruction.    Lets go back to 1995, a mission funded and planned by the United States and Croatia. This was Operation Storm. The goal was to expel all Serbian people from the Kraijna Region and all of Croatia. While the United States took out all Serbian radar, Croatian and Bosnian forces rounded up hundreds and thousands of Serbian families and removed them from their property and burned all villages and Serbian churches while creating a mass exodus of innocent people. Many Serbs were killed in the process by shots to the head and mass beheadings by Islamic cowards. How can one justify shooting a baby in the head? All of these atrocities were praised by not only Clinton himself but Tudjman who claimed it to be a "moral victory." All this coming from an idiot who boasted that his wife "was not a jew, nor a dirty Serb."    Should Radovan Karadzic be sentenced? For what? Doing what everyone does in a civil war. What gives foreign puppet states and courts, countries who backed or aided Nazi Germany, and ones who aide terrorists the right to judge leaders in an unfair and biased judicial system? Anyone who studies history and current events without bias should understand that Radovan Karadzic was no different than his enemies. He was just not what the Clinton world wanted therefor will be tried unjustly and in a court that only looks out for personal interests! The truth will eventually surface and make blind minds visualize again!|`|5FTX87Cxaa	Ya dude!

Most of the members of the World Court don't believe in capital punishment, though they might make an exception for a criminal on this level.    The primary purpose of trying Karadzic is not simply punishment or vengeance.  It is to show the world what happened.  This was also the purpose Spain wanted to try Pinochet.  And the reason the US should try Bush and Cheney.  It's not a matter of getting even, its a matter of setting the record straight.|`|jPt4iwICaa	No, he should not.

It's kind of like a "Liberal Arts" degree. It teaches you a lot of information about the business world. It will help you to get just about any job you want that requires a degree.    Please look into this. See what classes are included. You will learn so much valuable information.     Environmental Studies could easily be a bust. As the economy has a downturn, less people are able to spend money on consultants to make sure they don't disturb some rat's habitat. This is a shaky career.    Information Systems and Computer Information and Science will always be a decent career, but, as the programmers have demanded higher and higher salaries, many of the jobs have gone overseas. It's not the gravy train that it used to be.|`|xw13XqNaaa	Most of the jobs being created todays are governmental related.  As such, the Environmental Studies degree would be the best in terms of employment.  IT is being viewed as support now that a lot of people have IS degrees.

Either from the future or from 1 industry to another.|`|esgR6ayzaa	Every $10 billion in taxpayer money that goes towards extending the Bush tax cuts would create or save just 10,000 jobs VERSUS nearly 60,000 jobs which could be created or saved by extending unemployment benefits and food stamps (stimulating demand for goods and services) or investing directly in energy, transportation and education infrastructure.    As has been extensively documented, the most effective way to close the GDP gap and lay a foundation for long run growth is by getting money into the hands of people who are most likely to spend it (struggling families), helping to shore up state budgets to prevent service cuts and property tax hikes, and through direct investment by the federal government.

gasquENMaa	By all means, write a good letter. Address it to the parole board, not the Judge. The one thing the parole board looks for more than anything else is knowing that family members will be there to help him while he is on parole. To adjust back to a private life, to have a place to live and a support group of concerned relatives.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|zwctZ812aa	They won't read them out loud, but the parole officers on the board will read them. You just write what a great person he is despite the mistakes he has made.  give some examples of big ways he has changed, or good things he has done in his life to prove he has a good heart (assuming he does).  You write what a great supportive family he has and how willing you all are to help him assimilate and become a productive member of society.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	No they won't read them out loud but they do take them into consideration.  If the parole officer knows there will be family and friends willing to help him, he will probably get early parole.  I have done this several times for my son.

The man that did this to him was give 14 years, and was released in 7 for "good behavior."  My great uncle lived for another 30 years in his own hell!    So, before you write the letter about how your brother has changed and how stupid he was or whatever else you plan to include, make sure he has changed.  You do not want to be the reason he was released and then went out and did something "stupid" again.    I really do hope he has changed....for his sake and the sake of every one around.    Me|`|TEAaEXgJaa	Usually the judge doesn't have anything to do with the parole board, you need to contact your states department of corrections and ask them the procedures for writing letters to the parole board.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	No , most likely they won't read it out loud.  What they are looking for is that your brother will have a stable environment to return to and that he will have a support group.  Not necessarily financial support, but good friends and family to support him if he gets discouraged, needs leads for work etc.  If your brother can convince them he has a place to live and a job to go to , it will help him immensely.
zUZRPmYAaa	NO, only the legal owner can evict.|`|AA11206283	Not the owner.    Nope.|`|143bm6cnaa	If your brother has a lease or rental agreement with your father, and your name is not on that agreement, then he can evict you.  If you are both living there with the permission of your father, then only your father can initiate eviction proceedings.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	No. Only the owner of the house can evict.Just tell your brother 'good luck with that'.|`|KDst9z5Naa	No , he cannot. The only person that can legally evict you from your house is the owner which is your father. That law is in  50 states . I just called a real estate attorney that I know as a friend  to be sure . They are absolutely sure  that  the owner of the house can only evict a person not another tennant.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Unless, your dad has granted your brother a lease to the property.  I might obtain a copy of your dad's deed from the deed vault at the country courthouse.  Just give them your dad's name and the names of the people who transferred the real estate to your dad.  The reason: to underscore to your brother that his threats are not legally grounded and that you can only be evicted by your dad.  Most important, I hope your dad is still mentally about himself.  I would hope that the problem your brother creates with these eviction threats can be resolved without upsetting your dad.  Again, if your brother has no lease, then he has no authority to evict you.|`|sNuu8ymKaa	As said before. Only the owners of a house may evict other residents from said house. If your father gave him the deed, rights, etc. Then he would be able to evict you. But until then, there is nothing he can do.|`|VbAm6N59aa	Only the owner can. Also, they have to give you a notice to quit (so many days to leave) before they give you an eviction notice.

d76068f7391307fe2b165054f8c1d86faa	Key word - Okla-COMA!  Okla-COMA - people shouldn't even drive through here. I'm here in this state of confusion.  The prisons are a money making business across this nation.  Nation of incarceration I call it.  Until the law decriminalizes weed - it's going to stay the same. The prisons are full of pot heads, I was there for 20 months, not for weed though.  Richard Nixon - started the scheduling of drugs back in the late 60's early 70's. The reason being........all of the hippies were protesting the war and the only way that he could stop the protesting was to put Marijuana up there with Heroin. Same status........what a joke, anyway........then they arrested people for mere possession and threw away the key. And it hasn't been changed since then. And there is so much money made off pot from other countries the drug lords and such pay off who they have to - to continue making money illegally. Sucks but that's the truth of it all. And until, these greedy people in our government put a halt too it, it will continue. My question is why don't any of the politicians address this issue?|`|0P9GYAx6aa	I do not know anywhere, at least here in the USA where that is true.  Unless you are a major weight mover and have the 3 strikes against you.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	name your source please, because I have never heard of anyone getting life simply for selling weed. Even if you have 3 strikes, thats 25 yrs....not life.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Drug dealers cause much problems in our society, how much people overdose from drugs and die, how much people commit crimes to get drug money.    Half the people in jail for murder are people who were on drugs when they did it or were stealing for drug money or something drug related.  In many major cities drug wars is the number 1 homicide.  So many people feel that if they get rid of the drug dealers they can get rid of the drug related crimes.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Well,   IMHO,  selling drugs is just as bad as rape/murder.   When you rape someone,  you ruin a life (possibly several more).   When you kill someone,  you take a life (and ruin many others).    When you sell drugs,  you encourage illegal habits,  making criminals (and yes,  regardless of rather you smoke a little weed now and then or inject daily,  its a criminal offense) out of many people.   Some of these people then become addicts (actively encouraging addiction by offering cheap early,  etc),   who then commit further crimes to pay for the criminal habit (ruining MANY lives).    Glad they are in prison for the rest of their life.   After all,  since they were caught multiple times,  they obviously didnt learn the first time.|`|nbibIzC5aa	I can only answer this question by using my knowledge of the Louisiana law and your state maybe different.  In Louisiana, first and second time offenders do not receive life for selling weed.  It is when they have that third offense, do they get charged with an additional penalty of being a multiple offender for which they then receive a life sentence.      Unfortunately, until recently, Louisiana law allowed for the execution of a child rapist and for those who raped adults, the law called for no less than five years and up to 40 years in which probation was not allowed for the first two years. (Louisiana Revised Statute 14:42.1)|`|QP7VyPV6aa	Well what can you expect from a state that just legalized a legitimate business to sanitarily tattoo.  They are very very conservative run state.  While morally a reasonable person would think the worst of crimes would return the worst of punishments, unfortunately the powers that be are sometimes effected more profoundly by money and power than by facts and servitude. After all the powers that be are elected by the citizens to serve their best interests.  While there seems no logic, I am certain the thinking behind it is a repeat pot seller is going to sell to anyone. And if the sell pot what else would they sell. Would the gateway drug really lead to more crime when the user moves on tp heroin or crack? While generally unreasonable that's the thought process, as I've seen it.|`|BJhOd2usaa	Because people are stupid? And if a politician took a sensible approach to marijuana, he'd probably be skewered by his opponents for being soft on crime.
AA11206283	uh...jobhunt.     Employers have no legal reaponsibility to hire anyone as long as they are not discriminating.    I probably wouldn't rehire someone who left me for greener pastures that turned out to be astroturf either.|`|HL6T0FiXaa	Yes, the company(ironwood) is now owned by directv and directv's pretty strict when it comes to that. Directv's call centers are the same way. Husband and wife could work at the same call center, as long as you were in the same department. So if you were both reps on the phones it would be fine. Or if you were both managers, it would be fine. However, positions like the husband being a manager and the wife being a rep on the phones wouldn't be allowed. This is mainly because it could possibly be unfair. The husband would have the ability to do things for his wife that would be in her favor.    So let's say for example if you are a dispatcher and your fiance is a tech and a customer calls complaining because your fiance didn't arrive on job until 3 hours later. I'm sure you would have normal procedures to follow like maybe filling an escalation that your finace was 3 hours late getting to the job. Then maybe he would be pulled into the office and the issue would be addressed. However, if you are the one receiving the call about your fiance you may be more willing to not do the escalation because you are afraid your fiance will get in trouble and loose his job. You would be more willing to show favoritism towards your fiance.     This is actually not an uncommon policy with big companies. Sure you may be a trustworthy person and would never do such a thing, but it happens all the time. Even with brothers, cousins, friends, etc. I have seen it first hand in companies. A brother being Manager and just so happens that his younger brother gets some sort of promotion and there happens to be 20 people that are more qualified for the position.    So you see, you have to look at this issue from the companies side of things!
AA11902108	If this is her first time before the court and the items were small, she'll probably get probation/community service.

She will likely get ordered to do some sort of diversion program and be put on probation.  There will also be fines and possibly restitution (payment for stolen goods) involved.|`|wtcAK31Paa	I bet she'll get a fine and community service with some scolding/yelling from the judge|`|AA11740032	it depends on the amount solen value your age. if it is over 2000 you are tried as an adult|`|Bz799U4Xaa	the parents get to go to court and not that person i think|`|7DlEN6lXaa	It sounds like Sears has decided to press charges so the judge can give her the maximum sentence the law allows. She could be sent to Juvenile Hall until she's 18 and her parents would have to pay for the items she stole. She could be given probation and community service. There are lots of other things the judge could place on her but each one is individual and no two sentences will be the same.  Hope your friend has learned her lesson from this.
DTSUJe2oaa	declaratory judgment        A court decision in a civil case that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Unlike most court cases, where the plaintiff asks for damages or other court orders, the plaintiff in a declaratory judgment case simply wants the court to resolve an uncertainty so that it can avoid serious legal trouble in the future. Courts are usually reluctant to hear declaratory judgment cases, preferring to wait until there has been a measurable loss. But especially in cases involving important constitutional rights, courts will step in to clarify the legal landscape. For example, many cities regulate the right to assemble by requiring permits to hold a parade. A disappointed applicant who thinks the decision-making process is unconstitutional might hold his parade anyway and challenge the ordinance after hes cited; or he might ask a court beforehand to rule on the constitutionality of the law. By going to court, the applicant may avoid a messy confrontation with the city -- and perhaps a citation, as well.~

Had you stated that you wanted to talk to the officers, they would have contacted you first, obtained your statement, then gone to the residence to further investigate.    The police, however, have to tread lightly when it comes to complaints not made from the source of the activity. If they went to the door and it turned out all that you heard was a loud television...the police would have had to contend with complaints from your neighbors.    Mind you...I'm only guessing because I wasn't there with the officers nor am I familiar with your city.    Some communities have understaffed their police departments so much there are not enough officers to answer calls immediately    In my jurisdiction, we would have still contacted the neighbors to insure everything was OK.

rV1uAtt3aa	I'm not sure if that's true; the only information I see on China's bailout plan is to invest in infrastructure - the same as the plan Obama is floating.    Giving money to banks was meant to do two things: keep them solvent because their assets were rapidly diminishing in value; and keep them from foreclosing on houses.    The idea was to keep the banks afloat so that people didn't lose the money they had in the banks, and also so people didn't lose their homes.  If the banks had been allowed to fail, you'd have nothing that you saved.  In 1929, banks were allowed to fail and that helped kick off the Great Depression.  Hopefully, the bailout helped fend off a depression.  When people complain about the cost of the bailout they should be measuring that against the cost of being homeless, unemployed, and penniless.    Anyway, as I said, the Obama stimulus package is based on rebuilding our aging infrastructure and investing in renewable and green energy sources.  Both of these things should be important priorities for our country (many bridges failed or are close to failing, for instance, across the US), and we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil while finding energy sources that don't produce greenhouse gasses.    It is the same plan that FDR had over 60 years ago.  We don't really know if his plan worked, since WWII intervened, but I think consumer confidence is the last piece of the pie.  If the people and companies that still have resources begin to use them, the economy will recover.  So, spend it if you've got it, folks!

In fact, he was a plagiarizer and a whore-hopping, adulterous Black preacher who got a religious degree by cheating and then stole money from his own church. He hired Soviet agents to run his "civil rights" organizations, and, while preaching racial brotherhood, tried to get a Marxist class war going in the United States. MLK was part of a Soviet plan that, if it had worked, would have seen Europe fall to communist expansionism.

AA11206283	Visit the National Labor Relations Board. That is what they  do.|`|xoUxmiE7aa	Reality is no on the firing perhaps and only perhaps on the timing. Was this a one time incident on the changing of the time. To me if I were listening to you it sounds like you are just angry that he got the management job over you who had been there 6.5 years.      Most states are at will employment and if yours is then you can be fire for any reason at anytime barring certain discrimination issues.    Good luck and if I were you I would just move along and get another job quickly in this economy.

For a minor to live separately from the parents and have the right to contract-meaning buy cars and rent apartments-the child must go through a court procedure called Removal of Disabilities of a Minor. The law requires that the child requesting Removal of Disabilities of a Minor by the court show: 1) that the minor is at least 16 years old, living separate from the parents, AND, 2) the minor is self-supporting and managing his/her own affairs.    In doing so, the court will need to be convinced that this would be in your "best interest." You didn't say how you would prove this is in your best interest, so just something to think about.

The answer, quite simply, is religion.  Most of the states you refer to are dominated by a narrow and bigoted religious culture.  That culture opposes abortion, and also feeds on ignorance and an unwillingness to think independently.  An ignorant and mentally docile population gives rise to an economically unsuccessful culture, which in turn is less able to provide the kind of infrastructure and governmental services that are needed for a high quality of life.|`|fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	Probably because whoever gathered that data is an idiot.

The quantifiables are meaningless.  The bottom line question is whether or not people are actually happy, and you simply can't tell that by knowing how many channels they get with Basic Cable Access.      If the study based it on quantifiables, then they're idiots.
uh2bkRrFaa	He can give you as many tickets as you deserve. The fact he didn't give you the third ticket at the beginning was nice of him. You blew it by being a jerk, and then you're made because he's giving you tickets you should have gotten in the first place? It's amazing to me, cops do not make up tickets. Are you suggesting he can only give you one round of tickets and anything else you got away with is his misfortune for not citing you when he had the chance? He can give you 40 tickets if you deserve them.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	He can write tickets for as many violations he can find, no matter when he decides to write them.  Original intentiona has nothing to do with it.|`|LdTANtkqaa	It depends on the state.  In Texas, a police officer can write what's called an "at Large" citation.  They are required to mail the ticket to you, but sometimes this does not reach you or they get the address incorrect.  You generally find out about when you get pulled over again and arrested for the 'outstanding warrant' because you never knew about the other ticket!

It brings in revenue ,so right and wrong have little or no bearing as long as the law was in fact broken. Each ticket gets the county more cash flow, so what is going to stop most judges from collecting more money from someone who has broken the law, no matter the pettiness of the third or other ticket. The badge is their right to be the judge on the spot,right or wrong has little do with the legal system unless it is repetitive and reported.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	The law is the law.  If you break the law, the officer can site you.   And if he was trying to be nice, and you copped an attitude with you, I'm glad you got stuck with an extra or two.  (not saying that I would have given you the extra tickets)    Try and realize how difficult/frustrating a police officer's job is...try to put yourself in their shoes  he gets yelled at/cussed at/spit on for DOING HIS JOB  and he tried being nice.......    so to answer, it may or may not fly in that jurisdiction.....but the odds are you're not getting out of anything  and I sincerely hope you've learned your lesson    have a good one|`|b910713dceb8a16719f1f72a174818c9aa	The cop has usually 30 days to write any additional tickets. Legally, he can go back and write as many as he can find.  Only if the tickets have no basis, or are completely false, can he get into any trouble such as harassment. Why piss him off?  If something happens to you or your family, he is the first person there to help you.
e9EFUTIhaa	You're right!  I want to scream at somebody!  I want to scream because there are people out there (like yourself) that actually think a huge pork-barrel spending "stimulus" will actually do something!  All this bill is is a bill that will permanently expand our irresponsible government.  Read it..and let me scream this....  WHY ARE YOU SO IGNORANT!?!?!?  You need to change your user name right now, because wise YOU ARE NOT.  If you were wise, you would watch the video of the democrats saying that "we can't say how many (if any) jobs this stimulus bill will create."

The second references the mix of cultures and people in the US.  He is saying that all people are equal and should have equal opportunities highlighting himself as an example of someone who would be discounted because of his background or race in another time or place, but the US has become more inclusive and tolerant creating an environment where he can be president.    There is nothing narcissistic or racial about these remarks, just observations on our past.|`|j7l9gavRaa	the first quote means that it is not the government that has made America come so far it is the people that have stuck to their ideals and faith    the second quote means that our liberty and our creed is that today we can celebrate the fact that our country has moved past racism and segregation and now every citizen has oppurtunities
U9bQgfY9aa	If you are laid off, you have a very short time to leave the USA unless you can get a tourist visa really fast. After that you are an illegal and the rest of your H-1B is void.

If you leave the country you can get the H-1B put on hold and when you land a new job, the new employer can apply to take over the remaining time on it.

You can only use your H-1B further if you have another job lined up.|`|615U9C8naa	you should be very careful with this if you don't want to be denied re-entry.

At this moment, you are deportable under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i), status violator. You would be wise to make arrangements to depart as soon as possible.    As for obtaining a new visa to come back, that would be possible if the petitioner wanted you back to work. If they never want you to work for them again, you won't be able to get a visa to return to their employment.    But the first thing you should worry about is being out-of-status. The only way you can remedy that problem is by departing forthwith.
AA10465540	You will need to hire attorneys in both Alaska, where your mother lived,and presumably died, and in Colorado, where the storage units are.  Your brother has the right to enter the storage units until legally compelled not to.  It would be best if you could all meet and make a mutually agreeable settlement.

It terminates at the end of the contract.    The estate can change those instructions, since the contract is now owned by the estate.

Connecting the dots, I think that person should probably be your sister (who apparently lives in Alaska.)  She should contact an attorney--if there is a will, the one that wrote it--and have a probate case started.  The attorney will give you guidance on how to secure the contents of the storage units.

This might explain the descrepancy  Of the $114 billion in aid, about two-thirds went for immediate relief  temporary housing, evacuations, emergency repairs  the kinds of help provided right after the storm. But much of the money devoted to long-term rebuilding remains unspent. Billions of dollars in housing aid have been delayed because Louisiana had difficulty getting what it calls its Road Home program up and running  although that money is now starting to flow.

Its really time for everyone to stop complaining.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	lol.  that pretty much says it all.  some of us can "read the writing" on the wall.  others......not so much.|`|u23sBafTaa	You hit the nail on the head with that one !|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	Yes, that describes it perfectly.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Government waste at its worst, with hypocrisy added for good measure.|`|vDLnslBFaa	I look at the months on end whatever million dollar investigation of Bll Clintons oral sex as more proof of this.|`|supRA4eOaa	"Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them."

cl9Ghxrlaa	That's what I said last night after the evening news.  They shoulda thought about this a little more.  Why not stop it on Saturdays...if they really HAVE to stop it?      And, oddly enough, I always get my most important things in the mail on Tuesdays.    Chronos dear, we're Americans.  This is something we can complain about.  And it's in our nature to complain about things so you just shoosh!|`|mPLXUorTaa	Tuesday's the lightest delivery day.  If it isn't Tuesday, then it would be Saturday, which still leaves you with 3 mail-free days around holidays.  The amount mailed Wednesday-Friday is much higher than the beginning of the week.|`|9480b47d53181b325473487c60b671daaa	Most of the reason the Postal Service is not bringing in as much money is that with email and electronic bank and utility services the volume of mail is way down.  Toss in the overnight and parcel competition from UPS and FedEx and  they just don't have the business to run six days.    Not only is it more economical, it is also more efficient energy wise without having all those postal vehicles on the road just one extra day. And the reduced volume of mail is saving on resources as well.     One extra day of no delivery is no big deal no matter what day it falls on.|`|OklApvU6aa	it just shows how far our once great nation has fallen...|`|7G9PlO6Raa	Better cut the number of days mail is delivered than to lay off their employees. There are too many people now out of work and if they can figure out a way not to lay off then I say "Go for it"|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Economics my dear, economics.  No more, no less.|`|6ee3feb6285fbcb7ae64e5552099eccaaa	to me this isn't that big a deal, i only check my mail 2-3 times a wk. anyway|`|FIXKYCIGaa	You'll get the mail on Wednesday.  I personally don't see it as being a big deal.
7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Bush. Biden would accidentally hurl a match into the keg he was drinking out of with a straw. Either way, it wouldn't be pretty.|`|Fbiv0h2Iaa	Biden would push Bush out of the way just so HE could be the first to light the verbal match and throw it...lol...he can't help himself..|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Biden. The first Gaffer.<br>  <br>  You do of course know bush isint around anymore right?|`|EWhPNsnKaa	Biden...he never says the right thing...EVER!!|`|dyAMG21Laa	I doubt either would but if there was no other option, I think Biden would inadvertently say something stupid to set it off.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Bush.... he actually may have the nuts to do it.|`|VDgAJETtaa	Cheney|`|tLBjsrEFaa	Obama would give a fancy speech and we would be bombed|`|goe3y4FPaa	none|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Are you kidding,<br>  <br>  Both Bush's, unless the counrty had oil|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Bush is gone and Biden is smarter than that.
5boLbxzdaa	The House is likely going to vote on it today.  If it passes....and it probably will...it then goes to the Senate for a vote.  If it passes the Senate vote then it's all good.|`|y9CgveCGaa	Both houses of congress have to vote on it.  Then it generally has to be negotiated between them because they will approve different versions.  Then it will go to conference and both houses will have to vote again.  Finally the President has to agree to it.    You do realize that this stimulus bill is the equivalent of several thousand dollars of debt for every taxpayer.|`|gE03TUtQaa	Stop Globalization and spending Today talk to your Congressmen|`|01zxefjnaa	The House just finished voting on it and  it won. Not one Rebublican voted for it.
3kyLH5Ikaa	I don't feel sorry for Doug one bit, except the fact he going to jail.    Look at it this way, maybe going to jail will teach Doug what drugs can do to you and will get him off his addiction.  He will probably be a better person after he gets out and would thank his arresting officer for throwing him in jail because that is what got him to stop.  This is what happens to many people who go to jail, except gangsters maybe.    Possession of controlled substance like crack/cocain is a serious offense.  What did he think he was gonna get an over nigher?  Crack is a serious drug and can make a person go crazy and commit vicious acts like stealing or doing whatever possible to get his high on.    Police officers do what they have to do to keep our society safe, and that can be slamming him to the ground or whatever|`|qDsrQIhIaa	no i don't he had possession of drugs. though since he didn't murder any body some time in jail will do him good.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	No. In fact I hear the world's smallest violin playing in the background.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Crack cocaine is bad. I would say the sentence is fine, but the judge being somewhat personally involved with the case isn't so good.  He shouldn't have done crack, he got himself into that situation.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	He broke the law, possessed drugs, resisted arrest. He got what he deserved. If his lawyer thought the judge was unfair because of knowing him then I am sure that it would have been brought up and another judge would have tried his case.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Information on the availability of illegal drugs in the United States can be found in the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) annual report, National Drug Threat Assessment and the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) State Fact Sheets.      Is not about being nice.If you break the law in the USA you will do your time.    Even if the person has connections.They will get a new judge and will have to face tough time.    crack is a addiction and that could raise for the fact that more ppl are doing it and selling it.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Doug needs to:  1. Grow up  2. Stop taking drugs  3. Stop resisting authority  4. Stop acting like a victim  5. Stop blaming others for his own stupidity  6. Stop trying to live his life to please others  7. Stop worrying about what other people think  8. Get some principles to live by so he'll know how to live his life|`|AA11226180	Sounds like Doug made some really bad choices. Sounds like Doug placed way too much importance on unimportant people. If Doug really has to sit in prison for 5 long years I hope he does allot of soul searching and praying.    Doug doesn't need snobby friends. Doug needs to except the fact that he got in trouble on his own accord and don't spend one second in the cell blaming "anybody" for where he is now. Take responsibility and that will be the first step to becoming a better person.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Nope.|`|d8m44rGaaa	I have never heard of a crackhead that was a great guy, but I have ran into a few that would let you rape their mother for a rock. I recently saw one on TV that would physically assault his dad and little brother, too.     So no.|`|FYvCR8mvaa	Yeah, Doug sounds like a REALLY nice guy.  All nice guys shove crack in their mouths and then make up stupid stories for the police.  Being snubbed is a valid defense for just about any crime, I am soooo surprised the police didn't take him out for beers to cheer him up instead of arresting him.  Actually it sounds like Doug is in dire need of being locked up in an institution for the insane!!
lbGVdgr1aa	I dont like taxes.    The fair tax is a little unfair, due to disposable income.  Those with less disposable income will pay a higher percentage of their paycheck in taxes.    If i make 50K per year and neal Bortz makes 10 million.  We both only pay taxes when we spend.  I must spend nearly 100% of my income to live.  Neal can live pretty good and only spend 10% of his income.  So I get taxed on 100% of my income and neal gets taxed on 10%.    I prefer the flat rate.  I say do away with all exemptions, and write offs and everyone pays 10% of their income no matter what.  I don't care how many kids you have, if you own a house or if you are in college...nothing matters....just a flat 10% of every paycheck.  We could do away with most of the IRS jobs under this plan.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	it would create a massive underground economy. No one would ever want to buy anything new and there would be a huge black market to escape the taxes.    it would kill foreign tourism into the US as foreigners would not be able to afford hotels, souveniers, etc.|`|1amF7oNwaa	IT IS A VERY GOOD IDEA.  I do not believe it is right that has your income goes up you pay a higher percentage of your income in taxes.    With a flat rate the person with the higher income will still pay more taxes.|`|MBFeHS22aa	Not a bad idea but it will never pass. Secondly I think it will create black markets for goods. Today we have a lot of people working under the table with this we will have black markets. Getting rid of the IRS is a great idea.|`|2d66454da71ea52f9302b902d6991747aa	I'm against it.    I'll tell you why.    Living people don't have to pay income tax because it's a tax on a "God-given right".  That God-given right is the right to property ownership.  Your labor is your property and when you trade it straight across for money, the money is actually the medium of exchange representing your labor.      I brought this point up to the IRS a few years ago, and they sent me three years worh of taxes I had paid in a treasury check with a letter that said they recognize my status.    The state I live in wouldn't recognize my right in the same manner, but at least the fed did, so I don't pay federal "income tax" anymore.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	LOL, you have to figure if the Democratic politicians are against it it must be a good thing, it takes all of the spending power out of the hands of politicians and gives it back to the people and the states where it will do the most good.|`|RermzbWgaa	It will never happen.  Republican.  Moderate research.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I think it's a good idea, everyone pays in the same percentage and still the rich are paying more because they make more. Why should someone have to pay a higher percentage just because they make more. The percentage should stay even across the board.  Republican|`|5zJmqpMPaa	another gimmick|`|i2M7lyPgaa	I can live with it.,  If you don't buy it, you don't pay the tax on it.    sounds good to me, UNLESS they try to work it like they do property tax, where you pay the tax up front and then each year over and over and over until you have paid more in taxes than the item cost.
85jy4Mt0aa	In some states it is possible to handle the transfer of title of a house simply without an attorney.  Check with the probate clerk's office to see if a muniment of title is an option and if there are forms available.  (Note: In many states, the clerk is prohibited from providing the advice and services an attorney would have provided.)  You may also be able to file a small estate affidavit.<br>  <br>  Before you hire a lawyer, you may want to consult with a lawyer.  Most states have a lawyers referral service.  Go to your state's bar association website for information and contact.  The initial visit should cost you less than $30 for about 30 minutes of consultation.  In that way, you can find out if you can get this done without an attorney.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	If your dad died at work, there are probably insurance and liability claims to settle.  There may also be 401k or pension monies from his work.  This isn't something you want to do yourself.  Talk with an attorney.  You need to set up an estate to handle your father's bills with any proceeds he gets form insurance or payments from his employer.  Also, need to find out if he has a will.  If he didn't have a will, the state's rules will define how his money and house and other assets will be divided. <br>  <br>  Please start with the HR department at your dad's work, to see what benefits he was entitled to, and then contact an attorney.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for your loss.|`|AA11206283	Many people do. Talk to your probate clerk. Worst case you find you are over your head and you hire someone.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Worst case you screw it up and turn a difficult situation into a disaster.<br>  <br>  There's a time to DIY, and there's a time to hire a professional.
PPKuHl9baa	Immigration police should be right there waiting. I would LOVE to see that.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	They are allowed to march because of freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.<br>  <br>  That said, I hope that there is a counter-march of people who disapprove of illegal immigration.|`|X8CnrnH5aa	la raza wtf?? now you must be narrow minded or something because honestly i dont know a person could be so racist its like us calling white people gavachos and blacks slaves... it seems to me like yall dont have nothing better to do...|`|BpcgaJd4aa	We should throw eggs at them.|`|33oJXxELaa	What a stupid idiotic question. "why are these people allowed to march"? Because it is their right just like you have rights no matter how ignorant you are, (and you are really ignorant) and what are you and your trashy friends going to boycott? The march itself? Now that is a thought, a bunch of illiterate, toothless, uneducated rednecks boycotting a march they were not going to attend in the first place. Go get busy cleaning all the broken down cars out of your yard and leave the thinking to people that actually have brains and an  education. BTW, where have you been, prison?|`|kNBNBN0Qaa	They are being allowed to march because it is their right under the US constitution. Just like murdering white racists like the KKK are allowed to march.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-11-rally-kkk_N.htm?csp=34" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe you would rather live in China or Cuba where you have no rights? Please feel free to boycott, I doubt you would be missed.|`|IZALRGWqaa	If White racists can march, then so can Hispanic racists.  But if I was there I would definately take the day off WORK and protest them.  Scum.
711R4J6saa	I don't recall seeing anything like it before!|`|5wdPKphVaa	I think you are letting your massive insecurities get in the way of rational thinking|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Perhaps if you provided some evidence of what you are talking about I could answer the question better. As of now, it just seems like another Republican out-of-reality question.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Obama= Concentration Camps= Socialism= Anti-Christ|`|8TZzjGsnaa	As you have seen and will continue to see, people will flock to the beast like sheep. He will look like a leopard (Yellow) and have the mouth of a Lion but the gentleness of a lamb. He will deceive all the people of all nations.These people are not faithful to Christ and therefore will worship any man that can offer them hope and change even if that man just so happens to be the son of Satan.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	There is no zombie-like infatuation.   The right wing nuts jobs are the only ones saying this.      Just so you know-the things they say aren't true.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, what's an Obama groupie? If you don't explain what you're talking about, we have no way of guessing.    What deaf, dumb, and blind groupie mentality?    Talking like WHAT?    I voted for him, and thrilled he won, and have been applauding most of what I've seen -- every day, reversing a bit more of the damage Bush did.    Do you realize that by abstaining, you lengthened the Iraq war?|`|7Z25Rmxoaa	huh|`|B4kp487Caa	Soon enough they will all be using their Obama plates to eat their humble pie.|`|TyWGsPDlaa	It's really hard in college! I'm almost afraid to let anyone know I'm conservative because I feel like I'm being judged...    But at the same time, I can understand why people are excited about Obama. After eight years of an opposing party, a candidate who could actually excite people...excited them. I don't like the man at all, but I can see why people got excited.     Come 2012, hopefully conservatives will have someone to get excited about. McCain didn't really do it for a lot of us...
T1f5IB6oaa	Trust me! If you knew the true numbers of low life's collecting a free check, you would feel the urge to give up ! Yes, I'm sure Obama will give him a pay raise too|`|l74RoxUDaa	This sort of attitude comes from the right - what's in it for me, screwing the system for as much as you can grab from it.  I think it was the very sort of attitude Obama was elected to sort out.  Bullying such people doesn't work; they need to be inspired to do better and to be better.  And the opportunities need to be there.    Another charismatic young Democrat president once said "do not ask what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country".      I believe that before the year is out, your brother-in-law will have exposed the empty life he is wasting and find it intolerable.  By then, there will be very real possibilities that even this young man will be enabled to contribute to the well-being of his country.    That could not have happened under Bush and Reagan, who gave obscene bonuses to the self-assured, and let the devil take the hindmost.|`|R8yKGv18aa	Well, the next stimulus payment he won't get unless he employed.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Sorry, but I doubt that he receives welfare, unless he's getting some kind of disability.|`|c8f2b08d3fd8fb61fb9b5b49572c858faa	more than you know.  what is sad is that those who are 'on board' with helping their fellow man and don't mind 'spreading the wealth' don't realize that HE is the kind of person the majority of 'help' will go to. not poor kids,or the old or infirmed but perfectly able folks who have made a life on their @ss holding their hand out.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	I don't believe going on welfare is this easy.  Please don't make up stories.|`|a8s9RVNVaa	It's people like him who got Obama elected.  Smart, educated and working people like us didn't fight enough to get Obama out of the running. Now, luckily for us....these people aren't going to get as much as they think they are.  They are all under the false impression that Obama is going to pay their rent and car payment. I can't wait until he doesn't (because we all know he isn't) and then they hate him. Next election will be a Republican victory...mark my words.
AA10470367	"Yes we can" really goes over well with the many who believe people can't make it on their own. I would much prefer he and his party stress YES YOU CAN. I'm a firm believer in the individual. Of course we have many in our society who truly need help. I fully support the community assisting these folks. However, this doesn't include the vast majority of people who need to make good personal choices and work to be self sufficient. The sad issue is when have you ever seen anyone who relies on governmental assistance living a life they sincerely desire? We all know public assistance provides a level of existence that falls into the range of poverty. No one wants to barely survive. But for some reason it appears many people feel good about them self when they support the government providing for its citizens. This has to be more of a "I FEEL good because we help" view then what they are actually supporting, POVERTY. Wouldn't it be much better if each individual worked to be a skilled, employed citizen who could take pride in what THEY have accomplished? Just makes sense to me.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	Screw the taxpayers? Destroy this economy? Spend billions on pork? YES WE CAN! He totally means this!<br>  <br>  Obama is a pinhead!|`|VMuZYfMwaa	He meant "Yes, you can vote for me", and they did.|`|6zo7eKT5aa	He said "Yes WE Can"! There is nothing wrong with government helping this country get out of a depression. if all my neighbors are broke, I can't help all of them.|`|nlj7sk5uaa	Yes you can what? Successfully fail?|`|6T7NeR6zaa	By that he means the answer to this question....Can you pay more in taxes....YES WE CAN|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Yes we can, but won't. should have been the line.|`|SQe5IUgtaa	Wasnt he referring to personally wrestling a bear. Im highly certain thats what he meant.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	YES WE CAN take your money.<br>  YES WE CAN give it to someone less ambitious than you.<br>  YES WE CAN punish you for being successful.<br>  YES WE CAN add $7 billion dollars to the nation's debt.<br>  YES WE CAN say we will cut the nation's debt in 1/2 at the same time<br>  YES WE CAN do all of this with a straight face.<br>  <br>  NO YOU CAN'T do anything about it.<br>  At least not until 2012.|`|AA11369432	No, He includes himself  "YES WE CAN"  I think he means it.|`|Yql4JTKPaa	I think you mean yes we can...<br>  <br>  well I don't like the phrase because he stole it from Bob the Builder and Bob the Builder isn't on any more so I guess that shows you how far the quote "yes we can" goes.|`|e8lAALzgaa	Actually President Obama said "Yes We Can" not "Yes You Can".|`|AQep0wRvaa	Yes we can...take care of your needs<br>  Yes we can...pay your bills<br>  Yes we can...bail you out<br>  Yes we can...take from the working and give to the non-working.<br>  Yes he means it...|`|HLf1QYd1aa	"Yes we can" translates into "Yes we can and WILL take your money"
A7r8xX7saa	Yep. I have a friend who is nearly starving that I would like to help out.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Me too.|`|hOTSgwePaa	Not me.  Its just one giant pork bill, which our sons and daughters will be paying for.|`|flU2gf54aa	Not this particular plan!|`|AA11895162	Demcrats.  History has shown that when the powers that be did this in the 30's it made matters worse.  I wish someone (BO) would answer why he's not learning from history.|`|sNIIwHU2aa	People don't seem to realize that in order for such a plan to go through they are going to have to, once again, make money out of freakin' no where. Every time they print money, the value of our dollar goes down. So you will be getting money, but it will be worth way less than it was even the day before it was printed.    All of this printing money out of no where business gets us no where but one step closer to the day when it'll cost you a fifty just to get a cup of coffee.    Our money is also printed by the Federal Reserve, not the government, and every time they print money, it is taxed. The money our government uses to pay the Federal Reserve back is our income tax money - all of your income tax money is going to line the pockets of the few who own the Fed. Therefore, federal income taxes are also going to go up.    None of this is any good and no one wants to do the research to find that out, it's just a bunch of greedy little people who think they deserve to get money out of no where. This is just as stupid as the last Bail Out plan.    THINK BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MINDS.|`|fdb5c39b33371191416634f636fbfa48aa	Only if you want runaway inflation and 20% interest rates in 2 or 3 years|`|nvqeSQQSaa	yes of course better education more jobs better america! :D   i ? obama|`|AA11435910	no, I do not know where this money is coming from. This country is in debt to China. We are in the middle of a very costly war.  If there is extra money why don't we lower taxes?|`|g2yUDLygaa	I don't because it's a Band-Aid fix at best.  Pumping more money into the system, while doubling our National Debt, is not the answer.  The value of the dollar will continue to go down and down until we experience a crash very much like the Great Depression.  A balanced budget, with safeguards in place that require Congress to use at least 5% of the budget per year to pay down the National Debt, would be better.  Much of the reason we're in such dire straits is the fact that Congress has been spending more than they've been taking in for over two decades.  Our elected leaders need to stop looking at our tax dollars as their own personal piggy bank (maybe that's why they pump out so many pork-barrel bills...)|`|mGZCXPbTaa	Absolutely...I am also happy the tax cuts have been kept to a minimum.  I am a very firm believer in money needs to flow up from the bottom, not down from the wealthy.  I will probably be paying more taxes...but I am OK with that, I am doing alright with my income.|`|1f2ab14ef5ed92e673a1f5db9d7d9463aa	I think we were making mistakes allowing the bailout plan to go through. If every WORKING american had received an equal amount of $ instead of giving to banks and considering auto-makers and told these americans they HAD to spend the money in order to get it tax-free (however they chose to spend it) I think we'd all have been better off. Banks and auto-makers dropping off the face of the earth would not worry me. We've lived pre 1800's before, we could do it again.    Then again I disagree with NAFTA, and allowing anyone not normally born INSIDE of our original borders to become citizens at all.     Then again I disagree with the old customs of church and govenment being ruled equally and as one. Heck, we started making mistakes in history.    Now, I think Obama is ok as any other person but I've never really liked any politician I've met yet anyway so whatever. Everything could use a major overhaul...our lives have totally been governed right down to our underwear in this day and age.    The whole thing, much like everything else politicians do is just a band-aid fix at best.|`|xQgciq09aa	For the same amount of money, the government could send a check for $20,000 to $25,000 to every adult that made less than $30,000 in taxable income last year.    THAT would stimulate our economy, creating millions of new small businesses over night, and bring the recession to a screeching halt.    A STIMULUS Plan like that would still be Socialist, and much of the money would be wasted on TVs and cars, but at least the money would all go to the Americans with the greatest need for it, and a large enough portion of it would be used to create new jobs to justify the deficit.    The crap these Socialist clowns have proposed will do no such thing.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Use what?  $500?  I doubt if that will change your life.  And it will just add to the debt in epic proportions.    No, I am not in favor of this plan at all.|`|CBx6qHztaa	You could use what?|`|PPFonRYdaa	Yes. All the reports I've been reading lately state that it will in fact give the economy a boost. I'd like to keep my job.|`|mxXwQRfxaa	You don't feel any guilt at all?  Your children and grandchildren will be paying this debt back, with interest.  You might as well go ahead and raid their college fund.    This is no different than each of us opening a credit card account in our children's name, maxing it out, then putting the bill in an envelope with their name on it that says "Open this when you are 18"|`|1amF7oNwaa	NOT THE WAY IT IS SETUP.  IT MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE SHORT TERM EFFECTS BUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY NEGATIVE.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	The only ones are with their hands out.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	I do.

2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	If federal judges were NOT appointed for life, they would be subject to the pressures of getting re-appointed or fired. This would allow people to manipulate the judges by promise of re-appointment or threat of firing. Since judges MUST be objective and not subject to outside manipulation, and since appointing them for life drastically cuts down on opportunities to exploit them regarding their employment, that in itself is a good reason.|`|CowgOqXTaa	The policy of judges being appointed "During their good behavior" (Not technically for life) goes back all the way to 15th Century England.     Judges in England were appointed for life so that the King could not pressure them to rule the way he wanted by threatening to remove them from their benches if they didn't.     When the founding fathers wrote the Constitution they agreed with that policy, and continued it in the US.    In many States judges are elected, with some dicey results.     In the famous Texas lawsuit between Texaco and Pennzoil in 1984 over whether or not Pennzoil had entered into a contract to buy Getty oil, the lawyers for Pennzoil donated over $100,000 to the judges election campaign fund, and he made some very questionable rulings in Pennzoils favor. The result was a $10.6 Billion dollar ruling against Texaco - which bankrupted it.     (Incidentally, the judge and the lawyers were the only winners in the end - Texaco, Pennzoil and Getty all ended up as subsidiaries of Royal Dutch/Shell so the whole issue became moot.)    Richard|`|WSbfkuSZaa	Most definitely to ensure that they are making fair decisions based on interpretation of the laws.and not the popularity their decisions incite. If a judge had to worry about how his decision would affect his popularity with voters then why would he make a good judge?  I think also to make him think morally about the decision because this is his life's work, literally. He doesn't get to "get away" from it in 2 or 4 or 6 years, he is there for life! So any mistakes he makes will affect his entire career.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	Despite the various explanations offered here as to the thought processes of the founding fathers of the Constitution when they provided for Federal Judges to be appointed for life,would it not be in the fitness of things to retire a judge compulsorily in the event he/she becomes senile and is incapable of exercising proper judgment in dealing with an issue which is very important and may affect the life  (lives) or property of a/the citizen(s)?I think and feel it is very much so.  Also what about indecorous behavior?A detailed analysis by legal pundits may,perhaps,throw up a slew of reasons why there should be suitable provisions for summarily retiring a Judge.Perhaps,a suitable age limit may solve  a lot of such problems.|`|AA10118655	To keep politics out of the courts. By being appointed for life, they can rule based on their interpretation of the laws, not based on public opinion. Sometimes a ruling on a case will not be popular. An example is the Supreme Court case in 2005 dealing with eminent domain (Kelo v. City of New London).|`|5c11da57a7abbd2f5f9c598a4ae406ceaa	Independence.    If a judgeship requires election, and many local judgeships do, then the judge has to answer to the party, fill out the party requirements and make sure that your decisions are popular ones.  The Nevada Judge who got O.J. Simpson convicted doesn't have to worry about re-election.  But, then the case may have been held in federal court and the judge there is appointed for a term of service and cannot be replaced unless they are impeached or they may be taken out by scire facias.  This insures that they have the freedom of thought and action to make unpopular decisions, to interpolate the law with their own ideas and opinions and commits them to the study of the law since they have a quite comfortable salary set by the federal government and are not allowed to earn anything else except through teaching with a $21,000 cap on that.    Since roughly half of the law is based on legal opinions this becomes quite important.  No lawyer is going to bring a case before a judge unless he includes a favorable court ruling even if the law is cut and dried he wants to sway the judge's opinion and with their independence built into the position this becomes very important.    According to Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Stat...  ""Article III federal judges" (as opposed to judges of some courts with special jurisdictions) serve "during good behavior" (often paraphrased as appointed "for life"). Although the legal orthodoxy is that judges cannot be removed from office except by impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by conviction by the Senate, several legal scholars, including William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash and Steven D. Smith, have argued that the Good Behaviour Clause may permit removal by way of a writ of scire facias filed before a federal court, without resort to impeachment. In any case, judges hold their seats until they resign, die, are impeached and convicted, or, more controversially, removed by scire facias.    Since the impeachment process requires a trial by the United States Senate, and since the constitutional provision concerning federal judges' tenure cannot be changed without the ratifications of three-fourths of the states, federal judges have perhaps the best job security available in the United States. Moreover, the Constitution forbids Congress to diminish a federal judge's salary. Twentieth century experience suggests that Congress is generally unwilling to take time out of its busy schedule to impeach and try a federal judge until, after criminal conviction, he or she is already in prison and still drawing a salary, which cannot otherwise be taken away (see Nixon v. United States, a key Supreme Court case about Congress's discretion in impeaching and trying federal judges)."|`|AA11622716	It allows judges to decide cases properly, based on the constitution, statutes and other laws, without regard to the popularity of the cause or the pressure of voters.  Members of the house are supposed to be very responsive to the voters.  Then the prez.  Then the senate.  The judicary is supposed to be immune from that pressure.|`|6Gfz125Paa	to keep them independent and not subject to political pressure

Today, this philosophy is widely disseminated throughout the realm of politics, business, and government.  This philosophy is promoted by the media nearly 24/7 these days.    The philosophy that partisanship takes precedence over all other matters leads to conflict, passive agressive behavior, and obstinency in the face of overwhelming fact and logic.

CgGVpUI5aa	It will hurt, but you have to understand the function of wall street.  Lets say wall street collapsed because america suddenly either got conservative and invested in bonds or pulled out their savings and spent them.  Neither one of those outcomes would be bad.  However, stock prices correlate with dividends and earnings, and foreign money is a large part of our market.    It will be bad, and has been bad, when wall street gets hit.    My analysis (I could charge for this) is that the future outlook for the American economy is poor because of increasing tax and regulation and that is what is hurting the market and economy, even more than our banking crisis.

This is the kind of nonsense the leadership is spouting and it is reported as news.  <br>  I think the data is free to be interpreted however they like.

g2yUDLygaa	Here's the deal:    For starters, the Air Force is DEFINITELY accepting recruits.  As a matter of fact, they're trying to increase the number of officers and enlisted folks in the Air Force, so they're actively recruiting more people.  Heck, I just saw a letter from the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force saying they need 220 more Training Instructors at Lackland Air Force Base to handle the higher volume at basic training.    If you want to be a nurse in the Air Force, you have to be an officer.  There are several ways you can make this happen:    1.  You can go to college for 4 years, become a Registered Nurse, and apply for a commission.  If you're accepted, you go through Officer Training School (OTS) for 18 weeks and then you become an Air Force nurse.    2.  You can apply for the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at a college or university that has a nursing program and offers Air Force ROTC (not all colleges/universities do).  If you're accepted, you'll go to school for 4 years with the Air Force picking up the tab.  In return, you'll participate in the ROTC program full-time every summer and you agree to serve for at least 8 years (4 years active duty and 4 years Reserve) as an Air Force nurse.    3.  You can apply to be a cadet in the Air Force Academy.  This is the most difficult path because it's VERY competitive.  You have to be at the top of your high school class, you have to be active in your community, and you have to have a recommendation from your Congressional Representative in order to even have a chance of getting in.  If you're accepted, you go to the Air Force Academy (which is like college combined with basic training) for 4 years and then you go straight into active duty as an Air Force nurse.    4.  You can enlist in the Air Force and request a guaranteed job in a medical career field.  Once you complete basic training and technical school, you'll have a job where you work with doctors and nurses.  Your next step would be to take college courses (the Air Force pays 100% of your tuition for all your classes as long as you get a C grade or better, and most supervisors will work with you so you can make your classes fit your work schedule) and then apply for one of the enlisted commissioning programs.  Here's how that works:  You'll have to pass a certain number of college courses in order to apply, but if you're accepted they take you off active duty and you go to school full-time until you get your nursing degree, at which time you get commissioned and become an Air Force nurse.    BOTTOM LINE:  It'll take some work on your part, but it can be done.|`|d8m44rGaaa	If you are healthy, you should get in with no problems.    The Air force is always accepting people, they are just being selective, now.    To be an Air Force nurse, you need a four year nursing degree. Military nurses are officers. You should major in nursing at college and go into Air Force ROTC.    You could also try the Air Force academy, but I don't know if they teach nursing there, you would have to check on their website.|`|GJ3tNgWNaa	If you want to become a nurse in the Air Force, you should look at Air Force ROTC.  You go to college and participate in the Reserve Officer Training Course.  When you graduate, you will be commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant.  Your brother is partially right.  The Air Force is not pushing recruitment in MOSs that are not needed for current operations but they are increasing in other areas. Generally speaking, medical personnel are still needed.    EDIT:  The Air Force Academy does not offer a nursing program as per their website.|`|9Ge9DnLjaa	The military is always bringing in new people! The plan for the military is to make it grow, so of course you should call your local recruiting office. They will tell you absolutley everything you need to know, and as long as you have parental approval, you can probably already begin your enrolment process. My husband has been in the Army for over 15 years. He got several degrees all paid for, and decided to become an officer. It has definetly paid off. We live very comfortably and want for nothing. Good luck. The recruiters office should be listed in your local telephone directory, or your high school should know how to contact them.|`|htaxf1jJaa	yea you can be a nurse in the Air Force... but i think you need your degree or whatever, not really sure how that works. but your brother is wrong about the Air Force not accepting anyone at the moment because of the economy...the military is always in need of new people to join...my boyfriend is at basic for the Air Force right now.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	You can e-mail me through this forum if there is any term that you need help with or information on that I might be able to give you.  The military has it's own language so to speak as you have already discovered.  Basically the situation is that the Air Force always has had the highest standards for recruiting and enlisting.  It is the best service and most desirable for most people wanting a career in the military.  Given the tougher economic times right now and career and job outlook for many younger people they are more seriously considering the military as an alternative.  That in relation to it being the most sought is the reason why they can be selective-especially right now.    As for the nursing question you can not go straight in to become a nurse.  You have to basically have a Bachelor of Science, nursing  degree to enlist and then you go in as a second lieutenant with a commision.  They did have a program that would take individuals with two and three years of college who were already in and wanted to make that move into that career field that would send you to a two year nursing program and you would then be commisioned and owe them six years.  That program was going to be discontinued and I believe it now has been.      You may want to consider enlisting and going into the medical career field and attending school part time while in.  Then after four years you could get out and have the GI bill and go to nursing school and possibly go back in with a commision.  Some states also will pay for part of your schooling if you go into nursing and agree to stay and practice nursing in that state afterwards at a state hospital.  The nurising field is wide open because there is such a shortage of them.  Do some reading and checking up on all of this and don't get overwhelmed by it and drop us a line if you need help understanding some of this.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	You have to be a nurse to come in as a nurse, and you'd be commissioned.    You can come in enlisted in the medical field though.      The AF is accepting people.  Don't know where you're brother got that, but he's wrong.     Especially people in the medical field!

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No, wrong. Capitalism, and the imperialist system that develops upon its economic foundations, is the main cause of human poverty, exploitation, violence and suffering in the modern world. As a system of socio-economic organization, capitalism long ago exhausted its historically progressive role. The blood-drenched history of the twentieth century – with its two world wars, innumerable “local” conflicts, the nightmare of Nazism and other forms of military-police dictatorship, eruptions of genocide and communal pogroms – is an unanswerable indictment of the capitalist system. The number of victims claimed by capitalist-inspired violence runs into the hundreds of millions. And this figure does not include the consignment of the peoples of entire continents to unrelenting poverty, with all its attendant miseries.<br>  <br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  <br>  All efforts to raise the living standards of the working class and address serious social problems run up against the barrier of private ownership of the means of production, the anarchy of the capitalist market, the economic imperatives of the profit system, and, last but not least, the insatiable greed and money-madness of the ruling class itself. The claim that the capitalist market is the infallible allocator of resources and the supremely wise arbiter of social needs stands utterly discredited amidst the endless series of speculative scandals and multi-billion dollar bankruptcies that have rocked the world economic system during the past decade. The boundary lines between “legitimate” financial transactions and criminal fraud have narrowed to the point of being almost invisible. The separation of the process of personal wealth accumulation from the production and creation of real value is an expression of the general putrefaction of the capitalist system.<br>  <br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/prin-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...</a>|`|VIhj7ghUaa	"Sociliasm" for the rich is another name for "natinioal sociliasm."  I'm not blaming crapitalism itself, but the "free market" deregulation scams that eliminated most of FDR's protections that staved off another depression until Ronhole Raygun sabotaged them, leading almost immediately to the S&L implosion (helped along by the Bush Crime Family), then a little later to Encon, Worldcon, Tycon, and other con cons, and finally the collapse of the subprime and Ponzi St. scams.

Ask yourself this: Do you think like minded people would have thought Barrak Obama could have won the 2008 election four years ago, for that matter the 2008 primaries? You might try to play with your answer but there is only one, and it's no! He was an underdog with a surprise in New Hampshire. But now we know he is a smart cookie and hopefully he can capitalize on that. <br>  <br>  Based on the above and assuming a liberal could possibly think there is an alternative; Palin is smart, aggressive, and a great communicator.

Young Republicans, who were probably eight years old when Bush was "selected" for office, do not remember how prosperous our country was until then.  Together with the "Arm of the Presidency," which was his loyal Congress, they emptied the till, looted the Treasury, and now will neither admit guilt or accept blame.  <br>  <br>  As fiscal experts, the Party of No is a horselaugh.  The money for the Iraq War was hidden. It was a closely guarded secret.  No one really knew how much they were pulling out of the cash register until, finally, it was too late!  Greed was prevalent and encouraged.  If a banker or a broker could con a citizen into buying a home he couldn't afford, they did it without a single qualm.  The only Greed that set them off was when Limbaugh described a Welfare Cheat.  Then, they raged and fumed!  <br>  <br>  The Spending Bills are Bail Outs, one for the banks, one for the public. They are meant to create jobs for the jobless, a new energy grid, alternative fuel, help for the bankrupt states and the auto industry, Health Care provisions, educational assistance, policemen, firemen, construction and trains that are streamlined and fast.  It's about time some money was spent on the public, for our country, instead of enriching a scant percentage of our population with untold riches, while the average citizens struggle.<br>  <br>  So, whine away, Sore Losers, now that we have a President for the People of the Middle Class instead of a President for the Pocketbooks of the Wealthy.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	It's the government borrowing beyond it's means to repay ever : Just like the families that bought homes via liar loans.

2nRjy734aa	I can't believe all the people here sadly defending the racist one-drop rule! THANK YOU for teaching your biracial daughter to love *all* of her.     Obama is not a black man unless you identify race solely on skin color, in which case, Eastern Indians, some Latinos, and people from other races (who are even darker than Obama) are then black. Obama is biracial. Skin color does not constitute claim to a race nor should it give one rights to claim a race, it's culture, history and achievements. All people pass along 50% of their genes to their children, regardless of their race. Black does not dominate.   Obama may, to some, just exhibit the visible genes from his father, as far as his appearance goes, but he is just as much a white man. If you see a "black" man on the street and find out he is latino, should you still call him "black"? Some biracial people come out looking completely white. Yes, most American blacks have some white in them, but wouldn't that mean many American whites have some black in them? Are they black now? How ludicrous. Being the direct offspring of a white person is a whole different story, and it is rude and racist to that contributing parent's race (and can be medically dangerous) to classify that child otherwise. Some say Obama is black because of his "experiences". Does that mean any race "treated" as black is now black? I think not. Is the black race more important than any other? Then why only highlight *that* part of a biracial person?   The one-drop rule essentially says it's okay for whites to disown their own children. Why anyone would want to push or perpetuate that is beyond me. It's racist, unconstitutional and outdated, and needs to be eliminated. It's sad how so many people just buy into it without using deeper thought and consider its implications.   Biracial people share things in common whites and blacks cannot understand, and experience prejudice from both races. At some point, nearly all biracial children go through the identity issues Obama himself referred to in his books. Biracial people don't just experience but *live* white culture and family life [those (the majority) raised by a white parent]. Blacks and biracial people are not synonymous. Whether they claim half of themselves (and choose to be a half-person) or not does not change who they are, or their genetic makeup and cultural and familial history. Being "comfortable" with identifying with a race does not give one right to claim it.   Recognizing biracial people as their own unique and beautiful race does not further divide, it unites and makes whole these individuals within themselves.   An overlooked tragedy in this miss-classification is the fact that there is not a single history book a biracial little boy or girl can open up and see the achievements of their race-the credit is all given to blacks. It's wrong. First black Miss America-Vanessa Williams, though not biracial, a woman with white features and blue eyes (for God's sake). First best black actress-Halle Berry, half white. And now probably the most significant achievement by biracial peoples, the US Presidency, a half white man. See a pattern? I wait for the day when black people no longer accept their race as being competent unless they are at least 50% European. Black people are perfectly competent in their own unique and beautiful race. Watch commercials with black parents and notice the kid is almost always obviously biracial. The child is never allowed to be shown with a white man or woman, which is what would be normal in their home. Is there something wrong with a black child?   One day, the last race to be accepted as *all* of themselves will. Until then, I can only hear the words "first black president" and shake my head.  http://www.projectrace.com/|`|G9VBTg47aa	Perhaps they are looking at America only and forgetting there's a big world out there?|`|BJhOd2usaa	Because he's black.

As irrelevant as your arguement is I'll use your own silly argument against you.....does not having a relationship with one parent make a person any less from them?  Not having a relationship with his father does not mean he isn't black my friend.    Being biracial doesn't mean he isn't black either.      As for you "thinking it's stupid people voted bases on looks"....it is stupid that you even say that since you don't know why anyone voted the way they did.  You do a huge disservice to Pres. Obama and every single voter that voted for him when you assume something so ridiculous.      Your daughter identifying herself with both races is also irrelevant.

AA10118655	Based on all the questions you have been asking about this, I'm guessing this is something that is very important to you. If so, there is one BIG thing you are missing: A LAWYER. You have a much better chance of being properly prepared and having a favorable ruling if you have a lawyer on your side (note: not guaranteed, but better than doing it yourself). A lawyer can also properly answer all these questions you have (from this post and all the others your asked) instead of taking legal advice from an unknown source on Y!A.|`|AA11622716	A finding of paternity will be based on science, on the DNA tests ordered by the court, not on the question of whether it is a good idea.  Child support is ordered on a percentage of income established by the legislature, not on the question of maturity.  When it comes to custody and visitation, the court will consider the best interests of the child.  The character of the parents will indeed enter into that equation.  The court will consider whatever evidence is properly admitted in deciding the best interests of the child.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	I'm surprised that she was allowed to refuse the test if she's getting state aid.  They usually insist and if you don't comply, aid is withheld!  This is a pretty touchy situation.  First, You have absolutely NO CHANCE of getting custody until AFTER paternity is established.  So save  your "evidence" until it is appropriate to produce it.  Second, if your name is not on the birth certificate and she has never named you as a possible father, you may not even have rights to demand that she and the child undergo paternity tests.  The laws and regulations around paternity and custody are weird to say the least.  Talk to the people in the child support office, see if they can give you any advice.  Otherwise, I'd seriously consider hiring a lawyer!    P.S.  Steve L. may not be up-to-date.  The current practice regarding back child support only goes back to the date that paternity was established.  This puts an end to those unscrupulous women who waited until their child turned 17 to sue for paternity then got huge back payments.  For example, my child's father knew he was the father from the get go, but would not sign a voluntary statement of paternity.  I finally had the paternity test done when my daughter was 4 years old.  Child support started on that day.  The girl is now 12 and her father owes me over $20,000 in back child support, but that's from the date paternity was established, NOT the day she was born.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	just so you know, you can get hit with back child support. doesn't matter if you knew, weren't on the birth cert. or anything.    not telling you not to try, but these things cut both ways.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	I would suggest that you be careful what you ask for you might get it, I would say to you that now you are in your opinion more mature and you will be able to prove this by saying I have offered to support my child but the money was refused I have the 50 dollars or pounds per week here, I have been saving it for them for the last 6 months look here it is all 1300 untouched, or is it the buy your kid a toy and have fun type father you want to be, remember parenting is not a game and your child is the only innocent party and should receive no stress, consider this does the child know you, would knowing you improve the child's life ?
AA10206116	It is completely legal for a judge to make you pay previous years of child support. Sounds as if you have a good thing going not having payments. Don't ruin it. My friend pays $1,000 a month in child support.|`|AA11847612	First, let me say congratulations on being a stand up guy.    As for what the courts can do, they can do pretty much whatever they like. Just because it doesn't make sense does not mean it isn't legal. In fact, you could be ordered to pay a particular amount now, and she can take you back to court at a later date and you could be made to pay more.    I'm sure that different states have different laws, but don't expect the judge to be kind to you when the mother is there crying and talking about how much of a sh*tball you are. (not that you are, but she can make any claim she likes, truthful or not)|`|fMFWOB7Qaa	Look, sorry for my previous comments.  At any time, she can haul you into court and make you pay.  She is probably waiting to see if you will be a fugg up or a worker.  She is denying you, and that is SO WRONG!!!!   You have a right to see your daughter.  I would try the sugar approach.  Try writing her a letter or have an adult go and talk to her and her parents.  Don't start fighting with her unless this appraoch doesnt work.  I feel for you.. Women can be so mean and cruel..|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Child support doesn't really take into account YOUR age at the time the child was born.    And Back support is still due.  I have heard of cases where mothers took their children's fathers to court YEARS after the kids reached the age of majority...and prevailed.    So far as the birth certificate is concerned, a simple DNA test can prove paternity.     Its wonderful that you wish to be in child's life...but she still needs child support until she's 18, if not later.    Good luck.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Unfortunately - she can file for back payment, but if you contest it - they will be lenient, you were underage therefore not working for part of that time and she also did not file at the time - AND she had no intention of allowing you access, but there will be some back payment - that will date back to when you started working regardless of how old you were.   If she doesnt allow you access do seek advice before refusing payment, they will pull her up and allow you access again.|`|WjPkqk0Jaa	The best thing you could do is talk to a solicitor.

You should have protected yourself. In a lot of states women win period. Doesnt matter. You have to prove a safe and loving environment for you child for any kind of custody. And since it has been with the mother this whole time you WILL have a fight to go through. Get a good lawyer and prepare for a few years of this. Know that anything you say negative about her or positive about you, you will need Evidence of it. And the same goes for you, she will need Evidence if you were bad or good. Be the mature one and I wish you best.|`|7ee0e10ece5af89de3f8a94aef934127aa	well i know first she has to file for all of the child support and get dna test and recognize you as the father first before she can do any of this. and if you have receipts  or proof that you were trying and sent money then no back child support is owed. also you will not have to come up with the money at once if....IF you had to pay back child support. i dont understand why she wont let you see your child sounds to me you may not be the father and that may be why she is scared to let you see the child or scared to take the dna test and go to court she may not like the outcome. just keep trying to push the issue mabey she will come around and let you see it..

Meantime, my Son's credit is destroyed because his identity was stolen. The penalty should fit the crime. My son could have received time in prison for stealing much less than $50,000...<br>  <br>  I believe the identity thieves should be forced to pay for the debt and expenses created by their crime and the financial institutions involved should be investigated and penalized for suspiciously loaning the money...|`|AA11305474	Actually, there is a case in front of the court presently which addresses this very issue.  There was a law passed which now charges illegal aliens with identity fraud in addition to violating immigration law which when convicted, adds a minimum 2 year prison sentence for the crime of identity theft.  The illegal alien charged in this instance, is contending that he used the identity merely to obtain employment not to inflict intention harm by using it to falsely obtain credit and therefore he should not be subject to the identity theft laws.  The case has not yet been decided though it looks unlikely that the 20 or so illegal alien defense organizations which have come to his defense are loosing their argument because as you well know, the victim still suffers damages.  The unintended consequences of the illegal alien using your identification can impact your income taxes when the IRS discovers you have additional income from a place you never worked.  And, of course, as you have discovered, it impacts your social security account.

If you don't comply with the ruling after the contempt hearing, or if you fail to show up to the hearing, you'll probably find yourself in jail.  In fact you could be in a lot of trouble already.  You should comply with the court order before the hearing if you don't want to risk a fine.|`|a6HJbqA5aa	The two aren't even related.

It isn't all fun and games for them, though. Most of their time is consumed trying to figure out ways to keep their money away from the socialists running the nation (into the ground) currently, which may result in them having to shut down their shop. That would just provide more time for the drones to protest against them on the street for seizure of what they managed to keep from being redistributed, after all.|`|N5pPJUS8aa	Actually, what I see more then anything are mindless dittoheads.

Don't be sucked into these stupid debates. They change nothing and are a waste of time. Hopefully you will realize that all politicians are exactly the same and their party means nothing.

If so, they will hopefully employ skip tracing methods to locate her.

They actually stopped referring to it as a "war" for a while in hopes they could fool us but for once most of us kept our eyes open and now they have stopped skirting the issue and are back to calling it a war.

AA11288692	Yes. I work in a Cyber Crimes environment.  If there is nudity or worse and the image contains someone under the age of 18, it's child porn.  You should immediately talk with your son about how he obtained those images.  Next, is up to you. You _should_ turn the images into the authorities so that the person(s) in those pictures can be seen to ensure they are not being forced into doing those pictures against their will. The original pictures, and those responsible for distributing those pictures need to be stopped.    There can be legal issues involved in this. If you do the right thing make sure you contact NCMEC ( http://www.missingkids.com ) and select the Sexual Exploitation link on the Left hand side.|`|VjgqZetcaa	The problem may be larger than you think. If the PSP has non-volatile memory and the child porn is still there, and you're aware of it, then you are in violation of federal law for possession of it. Many people do not realize that pressing "delete" on a file does not actually remove the data from memory. The fact that you admit here, in public, to having seen it can and will be used against you in a federal prosecution.  Hire a techno-savvy lawyer to help you get out of this predicament immediately.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, you need to have some serious talks with your son.|`|AA12103453	If they can be classified as Child Porn then YES he could have been prosecuted.

You have to be more specific.|`|CBx6qHztaa	Yeah, but I sure hope you give him a good asswhoopin so it doesn't happen again.

The other thing is I'm pretty sure you could be held accountable as well (im not a lawyer so this isn't legal advice here just an opinion) for allowing your son to have that in the household. You better start paying more attention to what your son is doing|`|HHv2qGGcaa	Yes, unless it was later proved that a cyber criminal was using his computer to store porn. This is not unusual unfortunately. His computer may be part of a bot net army used for storing nefarious things like child porn.|`|WcTZ7n8waa	Yes definitely. you just need to keep an eye on your son's things.|`|JT4OkvFeaa	Depends on how much common sense a prosecutor has.    But it is doubtful.     Might have to do some kind of community service, etc.    Keep in mind though it may not even be child porn.   Just nude pictures are not classified necessarily as porn.  It depends on acts that may be taking place, etc.    Since you used the word "might", it is doubtful that it would be classified as such.|`|4a794be0b10e1654ae311d5a98cb3b2eaa	Receiving/sharing child pornography is a crime - since the child is a minor the parent (you) could be held responsible.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Since the process involved in the application of the death penalty is administered by human beings and since we have NEVER been able to figure out a way to do this without the bias and mistakes inherent in human decision-making, it results in a system so fraught with bias and error that the decisions coming from in are so arbitrary and capricious so as to violate the 8th and 14th amendment protections of the Constitution.    It is not about "good" or "bad" functional or not. The FACT remains, we cannot do it fairly. Since we cannot, we should not do it at all.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Logically we can not punish those who commit murder with murder, and still claim any moral or ethical standing.    I sympathize with victims families, and the wanting of vengeance. If the victims really wanted death to the perpetrator, they should have to carry it out themselves. I believe this would eliminate the death penalty.|`|Yzcptoagaa	There is no justification for killing a human being who has already been placed in confienment and is no longer a danger to the public.  The death penalty is also inflicted unfairly on the poor, and has been mistakenly inflicted on the innocent as well.      One measure of a civilization is how it treats its prisoners.  We should join the rest of the free world in prohibiting death as a penalty for crime.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	The death penalty would be good if properly used.  However, many inmates sentenced to death sit in prison for a lifetime while the appeal process moves slowly.      Meanwhile our prison system is greatly overloaded causing an extremely heavy debt on most of our state governments that is helping them to sink financially causing our taxes to go up.|`|73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Bad.  I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:    1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.    Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:    2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason  1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.    3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida  the most active execution state at the time  to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see  2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murderby killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, do as I say, not as I do.    4. Theres also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DONT have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, I wish you had killed me.  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."    5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects an eye for an eye (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally decided to look at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.    The most disturbing thing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, cant guarantee we wont execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.    A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.    Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.     Other important facts:   Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty.     The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that dont.    There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.    The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?    Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.

Plus torture or life imprisonment is far more painful :)|`|VR7JfxM4aa	I do not.    It is not a deterrent to violent crime    It costs taxpayers far more than simple incarceration    Our society is not yet perfect at deciding who is innocent & who is guilty    The State should not have the power to murder its citizens|`|NvsFhD7Laa	If someone is evil enough to willfully take the life of another person, then they should be well prepared to lose their own life if they are caught and found guilty by a jury of their peers for the crime.    If you were the mother, father, brother, or sister of a person who was murdered, you would absolutely be for the death penalty.  There is simply nothing that can replace a lost loved one...     Of course, the death penalty is not appropriate in all circumstances, but in some cases, it is and should rightfully be used.

AA10667393	Would it happen? Possibly. Could it happen? Yes, but not likely without a lot more involved than just the death of the custodial parent. In countries that still have extended families, like Pakistan, other family members would step in to take care of the child. If the mother was an expat (expatriate, a non-Pakistani living in Pakistan) and the custody was due to a divorce in England, the father might have a case, but would probably have to convince a Pakistani court it was in the best interests of the child to go live with the father.

Richard K put it GREAT. stop acting like a spoiled child and grow up. take a little personal responsibility, and get over it.    you knew the rules, if you didnt want your "house" phone taken away then you shouldnt have had it on or at school, leave it at home. there was a time before cell phones ya know, you wont die without it. and theres a LOT of people that have no phone at all and they seem to get by just fine.|`|Yzcptoagaa	You're not likely to get any court to tell the school it can't give you detention.  As far as taking your phone, did you believe the teacher was going to keep it permanently?  She can take it from you for the duration of the class, maybe even the day, but she can't deprive you of your property.    Next time, hand the teacher your phone, and if she doesn't give it back after class, then you can make a well-grounded complaint.|`|a6HJbqA5aa	You're 18, if you don't want to be there then don't.    School rules state that cells aren't to be on or used in class. If you break the rules, the teacher has every right to remove the distraction. I don't really care if you think it "qualifies" as a distraction, it being on and in class is a violation of the rules, and the teacher was well within her rights to take it from you and hold onto it until your parents get it.    If you were distracted enough to hear it and turn it off, then you weren't paying attention, and if other students heard it and your teacher heard it, it was a distraction.    The consequences of your actions don't make the consequences less applicable.

My last kid graduated High School two years ago, but at their school, that would have been an immediate suspension.    I can also tell you - from personal experience - that at that school they would return confiscated phones only to the parents, not to the student, so your mom or dad would have had to take a trip to school to get it. (And I assure you, when I had to do that - I took my sweet time getting around to it.)    Richard|`|TZz1uPY2aa	Depends on the schools rules. Were you aware of them.

Yes they have the right to demand it but they have to return it.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	They aren't suggesting "confiscating" your phone permanently, they're requiring to HOLD it until the end of the school day. Therefore your "pay the bill for it" was unwarranted. School policies like a restriction on phone use are legal. You implicitly agree to the policies when you attend the school.    The detentions they gave you resulted not only from your disobeying of the rules regarding cell phone use and possession, but from the way you responded to your teacher. They are attempting to teach you that disobedience of rules and insubordination and general recalcitrance have consequences, and it appears that they've been successful. Your willingness to give up the phone AFTER THE FACT was useless.    You've learned a lesson: The consequences of your actions outweigh whatever gratification you got from performing those actions. You can't afford to pay the consequences? Then stop putting yourself into a position where you might have to pay them.|`|WqRAWA4Yaa	Well since phones aren't allowed to be used in class    techniclly you didn't USE it     it was just turned on   and made a noise because it was running low on battery       just say that u could have sworn that u had turned it off before u go to school       and also    u didn't actually     use it...|`|1HLPznZhaa	You answered your own question by smart mouthing your teacher..Grow up .. at 18 years old you are on your way into the adult world of business or the military..You will find being a wise guy will get you a great job at Burger King but you won't go far in business..I am also sure you got your phone back at the end of the school day..If you are studying to make something out of yourself why do you need a cell phone in class ?

In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Regarding the cost issue, the figures vary by state, but across the board it costs taxpayers WAY more to execute some than to imprison them for life.  It's not even close.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that the government wants to be as sure as possible of guilt before handing down the harshest possible (and most irreversible) sentence.<br>  <br>  Toward that end, much more is spent on pre-trial preparation (most capital cases take a year or more to come to trial), more lawyers on both sides, expert witnesses on both sides, longer trials, jury sequestration, added courtroom security, and often an additional sentencing trial, to name just a few of the additional costs.<br>  <br>  Many believe the financial burden of death penalty cases is a big reason why you see HIGHER violent crime rates in death penalty jurisdictions - money spent (wasted) on capital cases is money that could have gone to police departments, education, drug treatment programs, and other government services that help prevent crime.<br>  <br>  See the website below for some individual state statistics.|`|4TkzoZThaa	0 officially.  There have been some allegations but no proof yet.  Keeping someone incarcerated in Texas costs more than 73 dollars a day.  Say an individual kills someone between the ages of 18-32 (most common age of murderers) and lives to the US life expectancy of a male (around 73) than it would cost between $1,445, 400 and $1,092, 445.  Many anti death penalty advocates will cite the costs of appeals as the primary cost...That may be true in places like CA, but here in Texas...3 maybe 5 appeals at 20K to 30 K a piece...plus average incarceration of 9.4 years...The needle is still a bargain even if the person uses all of the appeals.<br>  <br>  The individual before me states 130 people have been exhonerated...that includes commutations to life in prison...hardly a valid number.<br>  <br>  The innocence project has yet to free anyone from death row or show that one has been executed wrongly.  being post-humously exhonerated for rape is way different than for capital murder...different topic alltogether.  <br>  <br>  With DNA technology..the likelyhood of false convictions is extremely minute and the likelyhood of an appeals court or the supreme court missing a false conviction on top of that is even smaller.  <br>  <br>  Has anyone ever broken out of prison...even maximum security and killed people...yup.

No he didn't invent the internet (think that was a misunderstood claim), but he was technical and had some real life experience.<br>  <br>  When Al Gore lost the presidential race to Bush, he absolutely flipped, and after being witness to his insanity I was happy he didn't win the election (won the popular vote though), it set me back to rethinking why or how I made my choices on who to vote for. Gore disgraced his position in life by being not just a loser but a sore loser, which made me wonder how he would have handled the oval office. In reflection and my best guess: I think Al Gore would have been a dunce as the President of the United States!|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	yes definately better than bush... hahaha.. :)|`|MjfKjvzpaa	sure if you wanted this country under Martial Law.|`|Yql4JTKPaa	no because he actually believes he invented the internet kinda scary i say

Ot7PJrddaa	To solve the problem of producing LSTs in quantity the Americans adopted the design of the first purpose-built British one which the Maracaibo conversions had inspired and this became the 91?m. (300?ft.) 2,286-ton LST Mk2. Over a thousand were built and they played a central role in all major amphibious landings in Europe, from the Sicilian campaign (HUSKY) onwards. In the Pacific war they were first employed during landings on Bougainville, but over the great distances involved they proved too slow to stay in convoy. Instead, an American version, the 62?m. (203?ft.), 12-knot Mk7, known as the Landing Ship, Medium (LSM), began to be built in 1944.    Another important US design was the prefabricated 48?m. (158?ft.) Landing Craft, Infantry (Large) which could accommodate 200 men for a 48-hour voyage. Its bow, unlike other landing craft, did not become a ramp; instead two gangways were lowered either side of it. Used for the first time during HUSKY, the LCI(L) was acquired under Lend-Lease by the British and by the USSR. A smaller, wooden version, the LCG(S), was built by the British but it proved vulnerable under fire during OVERLORD in which 2,470 landing craft were employed in the assault phase alone.    Landing craft were converted for a variety of uses, from hospital ships to those equipped to render emergency repairs. One was even converted into a miniature carrier for launching two spotter aircraft during HUSKY. But the most essential type for a successful assault became the close fire support craft: LCTs were converted into Landing Craft, Flak (LCF), Landing Craft, Gun (Large) (LCG(L)), and the LCT(R) which fired banks of rockets (see rocket weapons). The Dieppe raid had revealed that these were a fundamental necessity after the lightly armed early versions of the Landing Craft, Support (LCS) had proved ineffectual against the German defences. They proved invaluable when first deployed during HUSKY and were first used in the Pacific during landings on New Britain in December 1943. Rocket ships based on the LSM hull were also constructed, and by March 1945, when Okinawa was invaded, these LSM(R), armed with 1,040 rockets which could be reloaded in 45 minutes, had attained the fire-power of some pre-war cruisers.|`|nbn0OXplaa	LCI's (landing Craft Infantry) held 3 officers and 21 enlisted soldiers.

AA10118655	only the courts can involuntarily terminate parental rights. But they will need some good, hard, physical evidence before they do that. And from what you say, that doesn't exist.    Unfortunately, though, there isn't much that can be done about your husband's ex being a b!cth. But, it is refreshing to see someone that will go through all this hell to keep his relationship with his child. You always hear about deadbeat dads trying to get out of being a parent.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	No.  If he is showing he wants to be apart of her life then no.  The only way he would get them taken away is if he wanted to give them up.   As long as he continues to do what he is doing he will get visitation.  Don't give up.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	I would try to collect some photo evidence that he has seen his daughter.  I've heard that in Ohio that you have to be without trying to make contact for 1 year before a judge will even consider termination.  If he has even tried to call her or send a card, that is contact, whether the mother lets her talk on the phone or gives her the card.  He has made the attempt.    If mom won't let him have a photo taken with the little girl, then get a friend to sit outside the house and videotape him entering the home with the film date on the camera.      Have him sit down and write down everything he can remember about the inside of her home and anything he knows about the little girl, favorite color, toy, her school, teachers, medical history, etc.  This will prove that he has been involved with her.  You should also have records of the support that you have paid for the child which proves that he has not abandoned her.  I would also see if I could collect phone records from where he tried to call her (when the wife wasn't allowing visitation) to arrange to see the little girl.    I think it is great that your husband wants to fight for the rights to see his daughter.  Just make sure that you stay consistent in visitation and don't let her down.  I'm sure the judge will listen to his side of the story.    Good luck.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	It is very rare that a parent's rights are taken away. A court will do so only if it is in the best interest of the child. She would have to prove that, and unless he's a drug addicted, jobless child molesting murderer, then the court is not going to grant her request to remove his rights.

And before you continue to ***** about the President vs. People on Unemployment, think about all the CEOs at the top of their companies making 8x what the President is.  What about them?    If you want a solution to the problem, BE the solution.  Complaining about it, and playing the "it's not fair" card just perpetuates it.  Those who are good at what they do and innovative, make themselves irreplaceable.  If you fade into the masses like everyone else, you'll fall victim to the mass' ailments.  This includes joblessness.    Blake|`|aI6QFXClaa	To lead our country it pays. Why did you not ask this question when that Loser Bush was President?|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Refer to grob & NeoNerd answers.      Additionally, there's this document called the U.S. Constitution which mandates the Prez' salary along with a whole host of things you may or may not enjoy - like voting for Presidents.    Viewed another way on the salary scale, look up.  Why does a guy who 'works' 2 weeks for a failing financial institution walk away with $25,000,000?  Why does another fired guy at another failed financial institution who presided over a stupendous $27,000,000,0000 loss walk away with millions in bonuses AND awards $4,000,000,000 of government bailout money as bonuses to his 'top-performing' lieutenants?    Remember as well that some jobless deserve to be (see above).|`|AA11301302	I can understand your frustration and sense of injustice. It always seems like moneyed elites will get the last laugh - and the last buck - but Jesus said, "He who is first, shall be last, and last, first," and "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."     So even though the presidents, CEO's, International Bankers, etc. seem to be unjustly salaried, in the end money will not save them, or any of us. Just pray for Obama that power will not corrupt him, and thereby corrupt our nation even further than it has already been corrupted.

I don't let the liberal press cloud my judgment.|`|kPx5kSbnaa	It is merely a change of regime what makes you think people love us now. We are as hated to day as we were two weeks ago. The show that some of the other countries showed was just that show. Wake up,the test of time will show whether or not Mr.Obama is a success. You have obviously bought into the hype,that is great that you believe in this presisent but I hope it is proven to be a just belief. This country needs a great leader right now and although I personally did not vote for our president,I hope he delivers on his promise of change. We are still hated by millions around the world and if you believe he can change that by sitting down with some of these terrorists and dictators around the world and talking with them you will likely more attacks on our citizens on our soil and abroad because history shows us with Hitler and the taliban who may I remind you declared war on us under Bill Clinton's guidance and many other times in the past,that we can not reason with people of this mind set. As far as the economy goes there is a lot of work ahead to fix our problems and giving a crutch to a crippled banking and auto industry will most likely prove to be the wrong answer. These two problem children need complete restructuring and I am not sure if Mr. Obama has the stones to do this like he claimed he would. If so I will happily eat crow,but are you willing to do the same if your blind faith proves to be ill fated for our country.

He promised them just what he thought they wanted and won their hearts.  Keep watching though, you will soon see things changing here and over there.  Was that Iranians that was just burning a picture of Obama in the streets?  Did the liberal media actually show that on TV?  And when this blessed and revered person gets that stimulus package passed we can all sing and dance in the street because nobody will be poor anymore!|`|CBx6qHztaa	I love it when empty, feel good democrats throw flowers and spin in circles.

And as for the world "loving" America again, it's more a result of Bush being out of the office then Obama in -- give it 2 years.  Obama has adopted many of Bush's policies and as such -- if people are rational/objective, they'll hate him too.     Or do you think people just jumped on the "it's cool to hate Bush" bandwagon?

The last thing you want to do is be pulled over for any reason at all and have to spend a day or 2 in jail to talk about an old ticket.

If I were you just stay on top of it. Call every once in a while and see if it has been posted.|`|aUYZMG8daa	I would keep trying to find out what happened to the ticket.   In some areas, a warrant can be issued for your arrest for unpaid fines.     On the bright side, even if they end up finding the ticket, you will probably win your case now because (depending on your area) the court case is way overdue, and you should have had your trial a long time ago.|`|KTPnlirWaa	I wouldn't worry about it.

This is law in all states. Below is the document.  EMPLOYEE RIGHTS MEMO UNDER FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT    To:          From:          Re: Your FMLA Rights    Dear [Employee]:         The FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons.  Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least one year, and for 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, and if there are at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.       REASONS FOR TAKING LEAVE     Unpaid leave must be granted for any of the following reasons:     ?  to care for the employees child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care;     ?  to care for the employees spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or     ?  for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employees job.     At the employees or employers option, certain kinds of paid leave may be substituted for unpaid leave.    ADVANCE NOTICE AND MEDICAL CERTIFICATION     The employee may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification.  Taking of leave may be denied if requirements are not met.     ?  The employee ordinarily must provide 30 days advance notice when the leave is foreseeable.     ?  An employer may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious health condition, and may require second and third opinions (at the employers expense) and a fitness-for-duty report to return to work.    JOB BENEFITS AND PROTECTION     ?  For the duration of FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employees health coverage under any group health plan.     ?  Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.     ?  The use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an employees leave.  UNLAWFUL ACTS BY EMPLOYERS     FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:     ?  interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided by the FMLA;     ?  discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA, or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to the FMLA.    ENFORCEMENT     ?  The U.S. Department of Labor is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of violations.     ?  An eligible employee may bring a civil action against an employer for violations.     The FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any state or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.    FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION     Contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor.
AA10118655	It hasn't passed yet. It only made it's way through the House. It still has to go through the Senate, and there probably will be changes to the bill before the Republicans let it go through (the Democrats don't have a filibuster proof majority). If it is changed, the House has to approve it again before Obama can sign it.    And no, a check is not likely to be part of it. Basically, the only direct effect it will have on taxpayers is a tax cut for most people so they have about an extra $40 a month.      *EDIT* - To Daze: The President doesn't have line item veto. Clinton had it for a short time, but it was challenged and the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Obama's veto power is an all or nothing thing.|`|AA11206283	Nope. Tax cuts only and additional food stamp, welfarre and unemployment benefits.|`|jlgfkyrEaa	The stimulus has passed the house now the senate must pass it.

It hs yet to pass the senate, and it has yet to be signed into law by Obama.  It is far from being a "done deal".    More and more Democrats are turning against it as well.  It may not pass through the senate without some serious pork being added and a lot of "political ex-lax".      It is not a good bill for our country and will not help the average citizen, it really shouldn't pass (i hope)|`|FByiwAk2aa	It has only passed the House, so the Senate still needs to vote on it before President Obama can sign of on it.    I guess the experts say it will pass and be signed by mid-Feb. Changes can still be made to it but the bottom line dollar amount and idea is great.    I believe it calls for tax rebates of $500 for single and $1,000 for couples.
JDltTREfaa	You can and should do whatever is reasonably necessary to get out of the way of the ambulance without endangering yourself or others.  If you can get through the intersection without getting schmucked or schmucking someone else, you should do it.|`|AA11206283	yup; as long as you do so with caution.|`|wuwUHukwaa	I doubt it.  Just sit still and let the ambulance go tru if they have too.|`|kAfZaLwraa	No, pull as far to the right as you can and stop the car.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	No. Not even the ambulance can do that, legally. If the ambulance hits someone they are liable in the courts. It is a question of circumstances, lets say a policeman booked you for going through the red light, you would win your case because of the extreme circumstances. But under the law no one can go through a red light. Another scenario could be: you are at a red light when someone crashes into a lamp post the post is about to fall on top of you, the only way out is to drive forward thro the red light. ?? There are always exceptions to the rule. The law takes account of what "a reasonable man would do". It is reasonable to drive forward just as it is reasonable to do same to let an ambulance through.  It is only legal if a constable in uniform waves you through.|`|bp59GQ0yaa	Not officially.  If you go through a red light you are liable to be done unless you are specifically ordered to do so by a policeman.    There have been cases of cars going through red lights to allow an emergency vehicle to pass and then they have been done by the cctv/cameras.|`|jHVd9l1naa	No.  It is a strict liability crime now.  You can claim special needs as a defence if brought to trial.    Most people don't seem to realise the law has been changed!|`|ucYwexwJaa	yes, often times it's the only way to yield right of way is to pull all the way through the intersection, depending on how heavy traffic is|`|KUVRekuZaa	A red light means "Stop" - with the qualifer "Unless it is unsafe to do so" and so impeding an emergency vehicle could be interpreted as the above.  If you proceed through a red light with due caution to allow an emergency vehicle to pass it is very doubtfull you would be prosecuted, even if it was technically an offence|`|c0a23f9219dea0c956fbebca1fda8189aa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... If the ambulance cannot get around you, then they must shut down and wait for the light to change to green. When it does, everyone must move to the right.  WE DO NOT WANT TO FORCE ANYONE INTO TRAFFIC!!!! Very rarely is there a situation where we cannot get around you.  We can pop curbs and go into incoming.|`|p6o0LoY6aa	No you shouldn't cross a line.|`|KfLfSzJ8aa	no, when an emergency vehicle is travelling on blues and twos they can treat red lights as a give way, you however can't - you can only try to move out of the way, otherwise they have to wait.
9tcv3TiWaa	A school because it is less than 26 weeks, will not be accompanied, meaning you stay where you are, he goes to that schooling location.  When he goes to C school it is possible that if it is over 26 weeks they will allow the move.    You will get BAH based on your zip code while he is on unaccompanied orders.  As soon as he gets to school he can put in a request and if it is authorized the Navy will then allow you to go.  They will hire a moving company to go and get your things.  You will receive MALT (mileage $.24 per mile) and Per Diem ($109 for you, 75% for those over 12, 50% for those under 12 per day) for the drive there.  You would qualify for military housing or you can find a place out in town and you would get the BAH for San Diego.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Not until "C" School because  of its length...|`|PPKuHl9baa	Sorry but no. You'll have to wait until he moves to his first duty station. As far as I remember the wives of sailors had to come and visit them while in A and C school but didn't live there. You're welcome to stay in an extended stay hotel or something while he's there. Other than that you'll have to wait. You'll get used to it. He is in the Navy and will be deployed quite frequently.
Qqj1VTmXaa	Apartheid was a system of legal racial separation which dominated the Republic of South Africa from 1948 until 1993, However, the mechanisms of apartheid were set in place long before 1948, and South Africa continues to deal with the repercussions. Under apartheid, various races were separated into different regions, and discrimination against people of color was not only acceptable, but legally entrenched, with whites having priority housing, jobs, education, and political power. Although South Africa was heavily criticized for the system, it was not until 1991 that the legal system of apartheid began to be broken down, and in 1993 was thrown out altogether with the election of Nelson Mandela, the first black democratically elected President of South Africa. The term is also used more generally around the world to refer to systemic racism which is tolerated, rather than confronted.    Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning apart or separate, and one of the first pieces of apartheid legislation was the Group Areas Act of 1950, which segregated living spaces, concentrating whites in the cities and forcing people of color into rural areas or the urban fringes. In addition to separating whites from nonwhites, apartheid also separated different races, and fraternization between Africans of different tribes, Asians, and Europeans was frowned upon. Whites and nonwhites held different jobs, lived in different regions, and were subject to different levels of pay, education, and health care. Apartheid paid no attention to former social or residential status, dividing people up by color.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	separation of blacks and whites in South Africa don't know what Nelson Mandella had to do with it|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Segregation keeping black and white south Africans apart.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	"Seperate, but equal" is the simple definition of apartheid. The main place where this occured was south africa, where the dutch european settlers seperated themselves from the native african peoples. It was of course unequal and racist.

He's considered a hero in the struggle against apartheid ala Dr Martin Luther King, which became a world issue in rhe 1980's... the world demanding south africa integrate fully. They did.|`|JSruV3Wuaa	Is this how you get all your homework done?    First of all you need to realise that it's not called 'the' apartheid, it's simply 'apartheid' without the definite article.    Daze: that's a terrible answer, it is not factually correct and is a little contradictory.  Razor: yours isn't much better.    The fact is that it simply can't be defined in 'about 5 lines' and anyone trying to do so would be doing history a disservice.      It certainly isn't only about South Africa either, as has been suggested.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	In reality it was a regime that brutally kept blacks in place. Murders and torture were commonplace.  Mandela became the figurehead of freedom and even the SA Police darent touch him tho he was imprisioned on Robben Island and other places for 24 years (he actually was a terrorist).|`|2yhtsxMWaa	The apartheid was the deliberate segregation of whites and blacks. The people behind this was the white government who obviously were in power at the time. The blacks and whites were not allowed to sit on the same buses, The buses for blacks were different and if a black person sat on a bus that was or whites only then there was a punishment for that particular person. The apartheid was eventually banished in the 1990s. Hope this helps!|`|DBuXLzjLaa	separate things for whites,schools trains etc,seperate things for blacks,or mixed if you wanted it,mandela was an ANC terrorist,was on you tube singing kill the whites,he had nothing to do with apartheid,i think that was scrapped before mandela got out.so now people in S.A.have no choice but to mix,S.A.was the richest country in africa.|`|Xe7mYwo4aa	when you google search it theres great answers!!!
P02L0DTNaa	Paralegals are subject to the principles of attorny-client privilege. However if that privileged information concerns possible injury, death or financial ruin that could be a criminal offense then both the attorney and paralegal can divulge information.

AA10118655	First, we will need to know what he did to become a "sex offender". That is a very general term, and not all sex offenders committed a crime against a child. A person urinating in a dark alleyway at night can be labeled a sex offender.    Will the child be taken away? Only the state can determine that, after they review the situation and all the circumstances around it.|`|cesTfRKPaa	I dint know, probably not unless someone files a complaint.  So maybe if you think the kid is in endangerment you should call the police right away. They wont say it was you they will just bring the cops to the house and if worse comes to worse then you should call DCF Department of Child's Families or whatever its called.|`|mFf8CqAraa	If he is a sex offender, then he is on somebodies watch list. I mapped my neighborhood for sex offenders and there is a gentleman living down the street and there are kids at his house. Just because you're a registered sex offender does not mean that you can't have kids of your own or date someone who does, but there are agencies that monitor you (for a certain period of time).    If I was your friend, I would keep my kid as far away from him as possible for the simple fact that they say people who have "tendencies" towards children never fully reform.     I dated a guy who was sexually abused as a child (of course not his fault) and the first time I caught him looking at child porn I bailed.    Whoever is monitoring his activities (whoever he has to check in with) would end up talking to your friend and she would be in someone's file somewhere.    The father of the child would have a legitimate case if he decided to bring this up in court...|`|gE03TUtQaa	Hopefully whats wrong with the mother is she on drugs?  I mean the father get the baby not the stupid government.|`|9twZdl6laa	Yes, because a child molester is not allowed to be around children.  And wtf is the matter with your friend anyway, that she'd even CONSIDER letting this perv around her child?  I hope the child DOES get taken away.  She doesn't deserve to call herself a mother.|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	Absolutely the baby can be taken away.  What sort of Mother would put her child in that sort of danger.  Does she really think he will never do it again.  WRONG!!!   If she moves in with him she deserves to lose her baby.  She should not even be going out with such a person.  Is she that desperate...OMG|`|AA10925759	The kid is 6 months old. So doing the math she slept with the father 3 months before that. Now she only 6 months after chooses to move in with a boyfriend. I suppose things happen.    So she gets a boyfriend that is a felon and a sex offender. Matters not what he did he has that label. So he will never be a huge success in life.     Point is if she moves in with him that says much about her. But yes the really big problem is that the father can easily get custody if she moves in with this guy. He can go for temporary custody and all sorts of things. He really only needs to get child services, social workers and all that involved.    I would think that if she wants to avoid any problems now or in the future you should tell her to dump the guy.|`|z8Euv8xKaa	Yes and shame on the stupid b-witch|`|3jGGzCUJaa	yeah
XR03jIndaa	wow, imma have to say that's not even close to right on that one. where would it end then? all the gifts given over the whole lifetime? you would end up owing then....how lame. I would definitely check into that. talk to another lawyer and see what they say|`|XNfjaPaSaa	Well, there is a doctrine that, in some cases, a gift given in life can be considered what's called an "advancement" on the beneficiary's expected inheritance and deducted.  I don't know the law where you are, but it doesn't sound like a situation which would qualify to be categorized as an advancement under the law of my state, unless her grandfather somewhere left in writing that he intended those gifts to be advancements.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	That's outrageous-she needs her own attorney to take him to court and tell him so.

Bachelors typically don't get authorization to live off post until they're an E-5 possibly an E-4 depending on the number of available units.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Housing is for those who are married and/or have children.  In order to qualify for housing you must be on accompanied orders.  In some areas they are allowing single personnel to live in housing if there is enough but it is several people in together.  Not all housing has that option, normally there is a waiting list to get into the housing, especially those that are 3 bedrooms and more.   When you first get in, barracks will be your only option.       If you are single then you live in barracks, you can have a room of your own or share with up to 3 others.  Depends on what is available at the time.  once you make E5 you can request BAH w/o dependents and live out in town.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	British Army, yes, you have to be married.

You can either stay in the barracks or once your rank is high enough you can rent housing for single soldiers, which is a 1 bedroom home about the size of a small apartment.|`|g2yUDLygaa	Here's the deal:  They don't rent out army houses.  If you're single, you'll have to live in the barracks until you make E-4 at least, at which point they may let you live off-base.  If you're married, you have to apply with the Base Housing Office.      If the Base Housing Office has a unit available, they'll offer it to you.  If you live on-base, you don't pay rent or utilities -- all you pay is phone and cable if you want them.  If no units are available, you'll be placed on a waiting list and you'll have to rent an apartment or house nearby in the meantime.      You'll get a housing allowance if you don't live on-base, but the housing allowance usually isn't enough to cover the rent on a decent apartment, so be prepared to pay some rent and all the utilities (electricity, water, sewer, gas, etc.) out of your own pocket.|`|GJ3tNgWNaa	If you are a junior enlisted soldier (e1-e4) assigned to a unit with barracks, you will have to live in the barracks unless you are married.  You have to remember that the type of living quarters that you get is also based on rank.  A married PFC will not live in the same type of quarters that a general lives in.      Many times, there is not enough of base housing.  If this is the case and you are married, you are given a housing allowance.  This is also based on you marital status and your rank.      There are also some other unique circumstances such as unaccompanied tours.  Most soldiers who are stationed in Korea are not authorized to take dependents.  That means that the soldier has to live in the barracks - but I think that he can still get a housing allowances for the dependents back in the US.|`|DZP77kRUaa	Here's the deal: They don't rent out army houses.     If you're single, you'll have to live in the barracks until you make E-4 at least,(NOT entirely TRUE)     at which point they may let you live off-base.     If you're married, you have to apply with the Base Housing Office. (NOT TRUE) (You can choose to live off post from the get go and don't have to deal with base housing.)    If the Base Housing Office has a unit available, they'll offer it to you. If you live on-base, you don't pay rent or utilities -- all you pay is phone and cable (and Internet) if you want them. If no units are available, you'll be placed on a waiting list and     you'll have to rent an apartment or house nearby in the meantime. (NOT TRUE)    You'll get a housing allowance if you don't live on-base, ( if you get the allowance, you get it regardless of living on-or off-base. if you live on base they tend to take the entire allowance back as "rent")     but the housing allowance usually isn't enough to cover the rent on a decent apartment, (NOT entirely TRUE) (Local cost of living may present different stories, but off-post what you don't spend on rent is pocketed)    so be prepared to pay some rent and all the utilities (electricity, water, sewer, gas, etc.) out of your own pocket.|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Yes you have to be married, and you can live ina house thats in the same that your stationed in.|`|4lO7CSn0aa	Given that this is a UK & ROI question, I'll assume you mean the British Army.    Services Family Accommodation (SFA) is primarily intended for - as the name implies - families.  That doesn't mean you have to be married, but the Army doesn't current recognize relationships that do not have a legally-binding association so marriage or civil partnership is generally a prerequisite.    The exception, obviously, is for single parents with custody or part-custody of children under the age of 18.    Single individuals without children are allowed to apply to surplus SFA but if the only reason is "because I don't want to live in barrack" then you'll find yourself at the back of the queue.  Turnaround of personnel is so regular that the Defence Estates team will usually hold empty quarters for incoming families rather than let them to a person without any need.    Otherwise, you are allowed to rent or buy a property, privately, and live out of barracks.  Generally speaking, the salary of a private soldier is such that this isn't an option until one has some rank under ones belt.  Moreover, living in barracks is cheap (sometimes cost-free if it's bad enough) and an excellent opportunity to save up the cash.

They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Well not sure about that specific date but I fought a ticket where the officer switched around my birthdate with the date of offense and the judge said that if this goes any further, it will be a problem so I have to throw it out.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	You can go to traffic court if you need an extension.|`|9VRwBeATaa	The ticket is still valid and won't be thrown out.

AA11206283	Might start with what jurisdiction you are looking for?|`|nbibIzC5aa	Constitutional law defines what the government's power is and defines what the individuals rights are.  Constitutional law states the powers of the government and rights of the people in it.  These limits are the foundation for which the laws of the government are based.  Each state has a constitution for which their laws are based.  The United States Supreme Court and each states' highest court interprets state laws and determines if an individuals rights have been violated.  Statutory laws are then passed based off of the constitution of the United States and the constitutions of each state.<br>  <br>  Administrative law only governs that agency and its procedures.  While it may define what rights an individual has, the agency does not limit the government's power.<br>  <br>  Family law is a jurisdiction of the law, in another words, its an area of the law for which certain cases fall into.  Family law does not limit the government nor the individual.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

65ee940d9c7e50d5aad318e0d8096478aa	Rickinno - has given you the actual binlical quote - however if someone does make a pact with the devil - in exchange for his soul, it is said to be a 'Faustian pact.'  For instance Gordon Brown Prime Minister of this country (UK) is said to have made a Faustian pact when he brought that old devil Peter Mandelson into his Cabinet.  Mandelson is thought to be a master of the most dark arts of Politics and there are reports of Mandelson having attended a Bilderberg group Conference in Canada many years ago.  To be an enemy of Mandelson is not thought to be a particularly healthy position - however having courted him into the present Cabinet Brown faces the treachery of Mandelson at even closer quarters than he might have done had Mandelson remained in the relativge political exile of Europe.    So when the press commented that Gordon Brown had made a Faustian pact by inviting Peter Mandelson into his cabinet the inference was that Brown would have to deliver his political soul to Mandelson in exchange for the short term help Mandelson offered at that moment.    See a play by Christopher Marlowe - Goethe in the German and an Opera by Berlioz I think - for the great literary tradition of what happens to those who sell their soul to the devil.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Talking about Bush? or Cheney?

2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	As several people have said they still maintain certain aspects of military life even in the brig or jail.  Depending on how he responds to this can also make his case better or worse.  The Army has a vested interest in him and his training so they would rather see him turn it around but if he doesn't then it will just snowball.  Charges of "not conforming to military standards" and other such things can be added to his already existing AWOL charge if he does not conform and behave while in there.  Hopefully he will get some counseling and get himself straightened out but if not they will then use everything in building a case against him and kicking him out of the military.  The more they have to use the worse the discharge will be if and when that happens so it is in his best interests to behave and make the best of a bad situation that he has already created for himself.|`|b687fae7049b11018b7d1fe34ce9be37aa	While in a military jail, your husband is technically still in the Army.

ERGGLvYiaa	No. That is a surface appearance. The truth is, it is nearly impossible to purchase ANYTHING of value without participating in the debt system for the average person and it was designed that way to keep middle class/average consumers beholden to providing entities. The same people that fund the credit also fund the providing businesses...do the math. Big Bizness created a circle of gifts that keeps on giving for them. The only reason people cannot afford things, is a direct result of the same system they are depending on to help them out.     Example:   CITIZEN wants to start a business but needs some start up cash to buy their products to begin selling. Citizen borrows from BIG BANK. Big Bank cahrges a large point of interest to the citizen.    Citizen starts their business and charges their customers more than the proper scale of pricing because they need to pay back Big Bank and still make a profit.    Customer wants to shop at citizens store but the products are now very expensive. Customer then borrows from BIG BANK to shop at Citizen's store. Customer has to get two jobs to pay back Big Ban after a while so the city needs more jobs...enter: Citizen  2 needfs to start a business and they too borrow from BIG BANK.    EVERYONE owes Big Bank after a while and they are the only ones not working at all. Our Federal reserve system works the same way in how it prints the money. Interest=slavery.    Citizens are not to blame in reality, it is our present system that suxxxxxxx. Interest is something they put mafia members in jail for yet our entire system is run the same way. They reward people with earned interest on their bank accounts just to cheat their neighbiors out of more money. People end up fighting for scarps from the Big Bank Table. It is disgusting|`|HZy629kLaa	Yes.  The government can't make people spend beyond their means but they can make them comfortable enough to buy a car or a home if they need to or want to...hard to commit to making major purchases if you fear losing your job.

Much of the economy is consumer confidence and it is down big right now.|`|lr74sHPLaa	Economically speaking, No, it goes against the basic principles of economics, it would only be a temporary fix/stimulant with temporary jobs, temporary cash flow, and when that is all said and done there will be no bottom under it all to catch it.    The strength of the economy is what it has always been, the American worker, its just that most obviously dont know how to really help them.|`|aV3bFchtaa	You have it right on both counts.

It's not just sending people checks.|`|rttm1SLaaa	Here's the problem with what you're saying: you automatically assume that there's a large portion of the population that doesn't have jobs that is in that situation because they "spent beyond their means."  There are people that do that.  Does that mean we shouldn't help everyone else, and include these people in the mix?  Does that mean they shouldn't have jobs, or health care, and should other people be punished for their mistakes?  The stimulus is mainly based around helping those people recover their jobs, thus being able to pay taxes, which pay back into the government and increase the flow of money in the economy.  Worst case scenario, these people you're talking about overspend again and become poor again, thus taking them out of the economy again and leaving those people in who are responsible.  I don't see how that's a bad thing, at least that money will flow back into the economy.    Edit: The majority of the spending will occur in the first couple of years actually.  I've got a link below explaining.    Edit  2: Apparently, you read the beginning of my statement and left out the rest.  I said that your assessment doesn't include all the people that would be included in this stimulus package.  I said you make that assumption because you don't include these people, since you assume that this group is big enough to affect the efficacy of the entire package.  You leave out too many people who didn't overspend.  More importantly, you left out my last statement, where I said that this would still flow into the economy, even if it's through these bad sources, and still help us on a national level.  I never said these people weren't responsible for their own problems, or even that this would get them out of their debt.  Since you talk about these people weighing down the system, that's what I was responding to.

VjgqZetcaa	The mechanism to overturn a Supreme Court ruling is complicated by the fact that they make the ultimate determination. Sometimes a contradictory case can be brought up through the appeals process and the "unconstitutional" portion of the earlier law can be limited or "narrowed."    However, the only solid way to overturn the Supreme Court on a constitutional question is to change the Constitution itself, which is a long process involving Congress and state legislatures all over the country.    Sometimes Congress tries an "end run" around a Supreme Court decision by passing another law that is just as bad, using different words, but this doesn't usually last very long, when somebody brings the question to court again under the new law.|`|DTSUJe2oaa	The US Supreme Court ruled Thursday in a 5-4 decision that a Washington, D.C. ban of personal firearms possession is unconstitutional. In a majority opinion written by Antonin Scalia, the court found that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."    Justice John Paul Stevens delivered a dissenting opinion that acknowledged an individual right protected by the Second Amendment, but disagreed about the "scope" of that amendment, writing, "[w]hether it also protects the right to possess and use guns for nonmilitary purposes like hunting and personal self-defense is the question presented by this case."    The case, District of Columbia v. Heller, stemmed from a lawsuit brought by special police officer Dick Heller against the Washington, D.C. city government after it refused to issue a permit for him to keep a handgun in his home for personal protection. The District of Columbia had based this refusal on the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975.    The Supreme Court decision upheld a 2007 ruling by the D.C. federal appellate court that had nullified gun possession restrictions and trigger lock requirements in the 1975 law.    D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty expressed disappointment in the outcome of this case, but stated that he will order the district's police department to provide a means for citizens to register handguns within 21 days. "It is important to respect the court's authority and to act quickly," Fenty said.  A large percentage of the people thought this was a good law but the legislature is the only people who can do anything about it the people can contact their elected officials and ask them to do something.~

Sexual Perversion    With regard to sexual perversion, the President's policy goals are spelled out as follows:    1) Defeat all state and federal constitutional efforts to defend the definition of biblical marriage as being a union between one man and one woman.    2) Repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) signed by Bill Clinton. (This is currently the only line of defense keeping all 50 states from being forced to recognize so-called "same-sex marriages" from extremely liberal states like Massachusetts and Connecticut.)    3) Repeal the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.    4) Pass "hate crimes" legislation granting homosexuals and cross dressers special rights denied to other Americans. (This legislation, depending on how it is drafted, could even attempt to muzzle any criticism of homosexuality as being unbiblical and unnatural perversion.)    5) Pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) which would force business owners (religious and otherwise) to abandon traditional values relative to sexual morality under penalty of law.    6) Create intentionally motherless and fatherless homes by expanding "gay adoption."    To see it for yourself, go to www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/civil_rights/ and scroll down the page to "Support for the LGBT Community."     Abortion    With regard to abortion, The President's agenda is:    1) Opposition to any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's abortion decision in Roe v Wade.    2) Support of the Prevention First Act which would provide access to contraception and "preventive services to help reduce unintended pregnancies" (a euphemism for abortion).    You will find these proposals on the White House website at www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/women.    Although it is not mentioned on the website, the President has made it clear that he will support the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA). In fact, he promised Planned Parenthood that signing the FOCA would be "the first thing I'd do as President." FOCA is by far the most radical piece of abortion legislation ever introduced into the Congress.    According to pro-choice advocates:    FOCA would overturn the ban on the barbaric procedure called "partial-birth abortion."      FOCA would invalidate scores of pro-life laws passed by dozens of states.      FOCA would eliminate existing laws against taxpayer-funded abortions.      In addition to pushing homosexuality, same-sex marriage, and abortion, he has also made it clear that he will demand a division of the land of Israel as part of a "two-state solution." These policies are national suicide.|`|AA11828439	Can you say "Budget Surplus". That's what The Democrats handed George Bush. Was your stomach twisting as Bush spent it and sent our economy down the toilet? Fixing this mess will COST.|`|AkIgv5WVaa	Oh God yes. I'm barfing now. 825 billion dollars, much of it down the toilet. THEY'RE KILLING ME!
s34GP3Ioaa	No, not really...except that my money is buying less these days.  But I have a great guaranteed monthly income so I don't sweat it.  Plus I have always lived below my means and I have plenty of dough put  away for a rainy day.  I don't let the news mindfu*ck me.  This will all come to pass.  The good side of this is that it is giving Americans a reality check.|`|HZy629kLaa	I guess.  I'm not in danger but I certainly have cut back.|`|kE29abUUaa	I live in Canada. So far, we've surprisingly avoided the recession for the most part. Canada hasn't really been hit like the US and Britain has been.|`|AWSmknxLaa	I got laid off last Friday.|`|AA11450062	Not really, I knew it was coming. You can`t just give our industrial might away and think everything will be OK. I watched this video in 2005 and I am now debt free because it scared me.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ1xkYfjf...|`|mkCjcG5oaa	Yes, I am having to put off moving plans due to an intra-company hiring freeze.  The banking collapse is what's hindering me personally.  It's very aggravating to know that as soon as it's over, I can go ahead with what I was going to do beforehand.|`|fFrdimDBaa	Well I got laid off yesterday due to downsizing so yeah I'm feeling the pinch.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	Yes. Comparatively speaking we are okay... but no mad money and we took a big hit on our retirement funds.|`|cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa	no|`|K4X2Tlwmaa	We must WAKE UP !!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Eqf6-tCa...|`|ZYcwuNkQaa	Lost my job...but on the bright side the illegal aliens at the plant got to keep theirs.|`|1f2ab14ef5ed92e673a1f5db9d7d9463aa	Yes. Over the last few years I have seen the price of food go up. I pay for groceries, In the 80's I could buy groceries at 80 a week. Now I pay almost 200. I've watched as the gas prices went up and I had to trade in my SUV for a car. I've watched as daycare costs went up from 75 to 125 per week. This is just a SMALL piece of the pie too. We don't eat out anymore. We don't travel as much anymore. And as I see my bi-weekly check come in I watch it go FASTER.     I think everyone is feeling it physically and psychologically. My dollar is worth less than it was 20 yrs ago. Paying the electrical bill is a hassle now and paying the cable bill is no longer "fun". Our incomes have not tidied up to meet the inflation either.    Go figure. More to come...|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Yes but I am Lucky I do all the renos for aprt and house re rentals people have to live somewhere when they are thrown out of their houses by the banks but I've had to cut back on my estimates because a lot of people are out of work and low balling the jobs to get any work they can even if it is for minimum wage|`|MZFpRxDEaa	well not yet, but im sure i will soon|`|KhBmlaefaa	Only the pinch of Democrats.|`|jKmbJyxJaa	I think the media is making it worse. Scaring people into not spending any money by constantly telling us how bad everything is will only deepen the recession. I know it is bad for some but we had a long time to know this was coming. We don't need to hear about it every single second of every day and mess with people's heads.    Not to mention people have been trying to live off credit and above their means for so long. I have NO credit and I'm doing fine because of it. People should have known it will come back to bite them in the *** one day.|`|v1a0PHdwaa	Our orders for low tech medical devices are actually up, but we're a quirk I think. We normally sell to lower income consumers but as the economy has gotten worse our products are appealing to more since they have to stretch their budgets more.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	The pinch for the working classes it is more like a nuclear bomb.
Re9Pdfxbaa	No, not sexual assault because all law applies to "A REASONABLE PERSON". However, if you tell the owner to stop the dog and he allows it to keep doing it, the owner can be charged with assault as he is responsible for the dog. You can keep away from the dog. If the owner thinks it is a joke and you dont and he is aware that you dont then you can report him for assault. Many people are scared of dogs, are you ? this will strengthen your case as long as it is clear to the owner you dont want his dog near you.|`|sy7K3m7taa	what a load of old rubbish|`|B5HyOmxdaa	An animal can't be charged with sexual assault.  They don't even have social security numbers!  :P|`|PcW8H1Asaa	You have nothing better to think about ?|`|18c3cdbd5154311f26ff1191e3091badaa	hahahahahahaha|`|U6YQAWbQaa	Woof Woof!!|`|AA11537248	To quote Bill Clinton...    "Define ****."|`|aKhZNd7daa	Lol - Trust you to ask this P !|`|sfJp4QNJaa	If the victim is female and the dog owner is male then nothing less than public shame and prison. He should have his  name plastered all over the media for being a bully pervert male for six weeks.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Yes, the dog was.  Why don't you go to the police and report it.  They could use a good laugh.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	Not if you enjoyed it. Then again, you find this sexual, how? What exactly turns you on, you weirdo.    Edit: Still not sexual assault, it doesn't even go in the same category as sexual assault. Failure to control their dog, sure, having the dog off a leash, maybe, stupid owners, sure, but, no sexual assault doesn't encompass an animals behavior.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	no
MEReSvZeaa	What do you want to bet Obama will apologize first?|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	Ahmadinejad knew that we will never apologize. That is why he has said this. Obama is very popular worldwide. Obama's popularity is a threat to Iranian power. Ahmadinejad knows this. The last thing Iran wants (the government, not the people) is to have direct talks. That will hurt their power.     However, we did do something wrong. We did overthrow their democratically elected government with the unpopular and brutal shah. Because of that, the Ayatollah took power and kept our embassy hostage.|`|DQT5ZDSPaa	He will never apologize.  I remember the incident well and I still think we have a score to settle with Iran.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	The US has hurt a lot of countries through its foreign policy. Yes, the US should apologize. That would be a good start:-p|`|swiOhDo2aa	If he had more brain, he'd be dangerous. He hasn't, and he isn't, and he won't be there for ever.    As it is, we don't need to bother. The Israelis will demolish his nuclear sites as soon as they get threatening. We can just sit back and enjoy the show.|`|eUdBD4tPaa	Obama has already told us up front that he would be a weak leader.  Of course he will apologize.  As for Ahmadinejad apologizing, I wouldn't hold your breath.|`|H1yiC98yaa	ithink he should put his money where is mouth is and follow thru on his israel comment. we do owe him for the 1979 debacle tho, you're right about that
GrzC57cdaa	Those people are not that stupid, and the democrats are the power, the ultra wealthy in the country who own the big banks, controlled Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae, Control the Entertainment Industry and the News media pretty much. They control Universities and most of what is approved for our childrens text books.     Was it delibertate? This group of ultra elite with their eyes on the ball of world trends and world power? You know it is, the odds of all of it being an accedent are astronomical.|`|lEaT5q06aa	actions taken by the Dem's and allowed by the repubs over the past several decades caused the problems    and the actions were deliberate    but i am sure that they expected a glorious outcome, and are thoroughly shocked by the current bad condition    i do not believe that it was sabotage except. possibly sabotage by delusion|`|BLMh0dG6aa	That was under Bush- he makes his money form oil.    Clinton left us with a near record breaking surplus which Bush used up before 9/11.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	one has to wonder.|`|wtcAK31Paa	That would be plausible BUT we had a republican president|`|AA11598520	Hmmmm....I don't tend to think like that, but you've got a point. Without all that, anyone who's willing to see knows that the Democrats tanked the economy when that got into Congress in 2006. Boy, you covered everything. (See, THIS is what a logical conspiracy looks like.) Sadly, the way liberals are, I wouldn't put it past them.    Apparently, the libbies are unable to admit just how little power the President has since they think they've elected the messiah.|`|ASixHKWKaa	As most will say, Bush was President, regardless of the fact that the economy was in pretty decent shape until the DEMS won back congress, amazingly just about that time the economy started on a downward spiral. I would not be at all surprised if it came to be known in the future that the Democrats in congress orchestrated the collapse of the economy to see that a Liberal won the White House    Now if Obama fails you will hear the phrase "A president can only do so much" and "It is congress's fault" Yes there is a double standard!|`|k6hicodfaa	No.|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	yes, of course.  the one thing they didn't count on was that it would be you that would be the clever one to figure it out.|`|KF48OjyDaa	You guys had control of the govt. for six years. Bush talked about alternative fuels for 4 straight State Of The Union addresses, and did nothing|`|PcW8H1Asaa	They control the congress !!  still do.    Were sooooo screwed !!|`|HZy629kLaa	Personal responsibility.    What democrat made John McCain say the fundamentals of our economy were strong?    What democrat kept Bush from campaigning for republicans?    What democrat kept Bush from the republican convention?      Why wouldn't any republican be caught dead standing next to Bush near any camera before election?    Personal responsibility.|`|OlCr3iNFaa	Yes.   Even if it wasn't a deliberate, planned effort to put their pretty boy into the White House, it was sure a happy coincidence that they can blame Bush for.  Because how could the country vote for a president who didn't know he owned 7 houses.   They would have to vote for the guy who will give them taxpayers money to pay for what they can't afford to buy.    Yup.  I think it could very well have been deliberate.  but then I love conspiracy theories.|`|AA12020119	No, I think you are talking about the Republicans. If you remember, Bush got a major warning in 2006, the year after McCain and Sununu were co-sponsors of a bill to privatize the over-sight of Connie Mae and Freddie Mack!    I believe Republicans controlled every branch of government, including the US Supreme Court!    And personally, I believe you are politically biased and are not using any actual FACTS in your misrepresentations!|`|3490bfd259ea171d15bc375ab4617cf0aa	Thanks Rush Limbaugh.  Spoken like a true Faux "news" watcher.    Now go find out what really happened these 8 years.    Click your heels and say 10 times ..."the dems were in charge the dems were in charge, the dems invaded iraq in a trillions dollar war the dems invaded iraq in a trillions dollar war the dems ran up the deficit the dems ran up the deficit"    The people of this nation are really tired of all the Republican irresponsibility and buck passing.|`|6E7Ebp1faa	I like enchiladas.|`|AIkmlvu9aa	I don't think they wanted it to tank this bad, but most of them are filthy rich (Like Ted Kennedy) so they really don't care    And they are in power now, so all the better for them.    Liberals = SCUM|`|VK4hUu23aa	Um, your wrong.  way wrong.  Instead of watching Fox News all day why don't you read the paper get your facts straight then come back to me.|`|9tO1slqRaa	Yes it was done deliberately.    The Liberals/Democrats/Socialists in our Government did this then Screamed their way through the election using racism, they were extremely sexist and use false information and buzz words like "tax Cuts" when it's really a "rebate check".....      Currently there isn't anything thing Obama or his Party can do to bring the economy back - the one they ruined. So in the end, once again they over reached and it will come back to haunt them.|`|jHcblhmVaa	And it was the democrats that sent jobs overseas and moved haliburton base to Dubai,and spent the budget surplus on tax relief for the rich and started our country's first preemptive war for reasons that did not exist, and it was the democrats, no wait that was the Republicans wasn't it. And how about the bail outs for AGI who's CEO made 850 million in the last eight years for running a business into the ground. The last eight years are the reason that the Democrats are in power now. And check the source and read the article about why the bill failed to pass that would have regulated Freddie mac.|`|yB0fWb1Uaa	100% yes it was an evil hostile take over from the get go.  A plan that has been in the works for many many years!!  They own our schools our media our homes our banks open up your eyes people.  Soon they will come for our guns then what will we do fight with sticks and stones??  Strip us of all our rights SOCIALISM!!!!
c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	I've seen a few "questions" on here saying that.  It just confirms what I already suspected.    "No Child Left Behind" has completely and utterly failed.    Voted against all the incumbents in my state this last time. Will do so again. And again. And again.|`|qkC4Imliaa	Lots of people.  Actual postings:    Will Gov. Blago give up enough incriminating evidence to impeach Hussein Obama?     Impeach Obama now, save time and get it over with now?     Can Proceedings to Impeach Obama start before Jan 21?    Where is the Best Place to buy: "IMPEACH OBAMA" bumper sticks in Mass Quanity?     if we can impeach obama for the market going down the past two days?     If so much as one terrorist act hits America should Obama be impeached?   How long will it take to impeach Obama if elected?|`|HZy629kLaa	Are you kidding.  I've seen impeach Obama avatars.|`|KF48OjyDaa	about 100 people have said that...i wish them luck...Obama's gonna be around for a long time|`|r6JskEtxaa	There are plenty of those people who want to impeach Obama, they even waste their time (which is money) photo shopping pictures of Obama.    Huissien Hunter is one of them|`|YCMUPkbZaa	Does this count?|`|um6rmdegaa	i think it all started some time ago when some idiots started beating the drum to impeach bush & cheney and now the other side is giving them a taste of their own medicine|`|x5mDmNlOaa	even if impeached it is unlikely he will be removed from office....    the POWERS that be have put him there and there is where he will stay...(unfortunately)    he is the  PUPPET of CHANGE    the Actual OWNERS of US want OBAMA to take the FALL for all of THEIR bidding's..........|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	I believe that for the kool-aid drinkers and obots,  that is implicit in any mention of dissatisfaction with The Zero.  For myself, I am down with the replacement of the House with Real People, and don't forget that we will also have the opportunity to switch out a third of the Senate.  Would that be a wonderful thing!  Hope you're campaigning for a seat in your area!  We need people like you, to actually represent their constituencies rather than Big Business and the filthy rich, not to mention the socialistas.  I say we pitch them all out at the earliest opportunity, and put in people who still know what it's like to live in and love America.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	You must be new here. (Oh, I looked at your profile, you're apparently not new to answers, but maybe new to this section.) Right after the election there were all kinds of whackadoodles coming on wanting to impeach the man when he wasn't even in office yet, and they kept it up all the way up to the inauguration. It's really pretty quiet around here since the inauguration, in comparison to the election and before inauguration.  But the whackadoodles came on spouting off about that, and every other bogus email that circulated during the election and since.  The people in question gave Republicans a bad name.  Most of them were most likely teenagers.  Welcome to answers, try not to get burned out in this category, there is a lot of ridiculous stuff that goes on here, but if you hang out long enough you can find a few good things to read and post on, just don't let the trolls get to you.|`|25GYtdEcaa	This is ridiculous.  Everyone knows that only a 'racist' would ask a question like this.  Ok, so back in the day the word 'gay' meant HAPPY and now it means something totally different....maybe 'racist' used to mean someone who thought their race was superior - but now it means someone who uses intellect over emotion?  I'm just sayin'|`|VOxXVI2paa	I read a question about Impeach Obama bumperstickers.  Does that count?|`|e52Wy71Laa	People see what they want to see, and ignore what they want to ignore.  That's why we tend to get all these questions along the line of "Why do all Blankisoids believe in killing and eating their enemies?"    I think the people who ask such questions quite often don't think they're just pushing buttons, but truly did identify some kind of pattern in their mind, on scant evidence.  It's what the human brain is designed to do.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	Not me, never.  Even the slightest criticism is equated with hate and/or stupidity.      I think anyone saying "impeach Obama" is accomplishing just what they've set out to.  It's more than evident here.  People actually buy it and allow it under their skin.  It's astounding.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Nobody knows what Obama will do..Nobody  but the impeachment of any president is a tool we can use to get   rid of a president that is seen as unfit or not loyal to the US    It is just a measure to protect us from bad men and women who usurp the power of President|`|9w9UHyCNaa	I certainly haven't.    You guys think Obama is guilty of commiting crimes? Don't make me laugh.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	They should all be hung for treason.|`|cQDAt46waa	His brother lives in a hut and his mom is on the Internet nude, and he wants to turn our liberties into socialism in America.....any body else doing all this stuff would be laughed out of the white house....some how this guy has put this whole nation into a mass obama hysteria
aabe6beac2525179d02308256da8576daa	Certainly it won't stimulate the economy. What we need is a tax holiday for a year. I am tired of having 30% of my check taken before I even get it.    ...I guess Obama said everyone would get a tax break, just did not know it would be so little compared to 1 Trillion the Democrats are spending. Too bad we have incompetent Pelosi spending our money when we have NO say so.|`|09aGRz8paa	i was aware of that.    i can buy $83.00 worth of stuff per month that i wasn't able to before or apply that monthly to my mortgage payments which equates to making an extra mortgage payment per year.  one extra mortage payment per year will end up knocking years off of my 30 year loan.  the amount of interest i will save in the long run is far greater than if i had the money and put it in an investment account (well, unless i put it in one like bernie madoff's).  i don't have a problem with that.|`|Yu3TevCHaa	WOW im really disappointed...|`|MEReSvZeaa	If I'm allowed to translate that into 332 quarters for a viewing machine at Miss. Kitty's, I'll be stimulated every pay day!|`|g5RS83paaa	that won't do much for anyone, my electric bill was $400 this month!|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Some of us will get nothing even though we pay the most taxes.|`|s80gQDmvaa	Sure, every little bit helps.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Instead of tax credits or adjusting your withholding status they should just eliminate withholding. Quit taking that money out of our checks to begin with. If people had to write a check to the government every year to pay their taxes they would actually KNOW how much they are paying and they wouldn't stand for it. As it is now the two most common answers you get when you ask someone how much they paid in taxes last year are "none of your business" and "I didn't pay anything, in fact I got a refund". The reality of that refund is that for most people that is just how much you OVERPAID. The government has been taking interest free loans out of our checks since WWII. They pushed it through by saying the needed on going funding for the war. It was supposed to go away after the war, but people got used to the refunds and CONgress was able to make it permanent. I believe that is why Americans got into the habit of borrowing and using credit so much. That is why we are in the mess we're in. We need to change that borrowing mentality to one of saving up for things we want and being patient. This will also help keep prices down. If people aren't buying things up at higher prices, on credit, the prices come down where people can afford them. Then the money that goes to paying interest now can go to actually buying SOMETHING. This increases a persons buying power even if their salary hasn't gone up. In fact keeping prices down is similar to a good defense in sports. If you keep the other team's score down you're always in the game. If you keep prices down everybody is in the game.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Getting or Giving I know I'll get a lot less than I have to give!|`|2gx2LgzEaa	It will buy condoms!

Most people that get checks from the government are poor Democrats who will be poor for life anyway.
AGf2HQ6Taa	As far as I know you'll go to Basic Electrician Course then Marine Corps Engineering School.   Engineering school would probably be a couple of months, but sense the Electrician is a "course" it shouldn't be that long. If you pass all the test. They change the rules with some of the test for alot of the MOS's, I was a combat engineer, I went to Demo Course, then Marine Corps Engineering School and at the time it was either you get all the answers right or you didn't and had to take it over again. This was back in the early 90s, Engineering school was 6 months at that time. I know a lot of time has passed and sense my days so it must have changed by now with the war going.

Blind optimism, shrouded typically in patriotism, abounds and is going to lead us to disaster.   -Peter Schiff|`|MLYQh8bMaa	Well, let's see now, we have a global economy with the US leading the way, and we have Barney, 'backdoor', Franks and Chris, "sweetheart house deals are the best', Dodd. And so, as goes the US so goes the world.     Btw, the banks in Australia, France, England, Germany, China, Japan, Russia, etc, all invest heavily in the US economy and, of course, the major part of our economy is the mortgage business.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	you should be awarded a medal    You use the term " neocon" falsely more than anyone on this planet|`|5zJq5XJoaa	The banks.

MPpO4xQMaa	Yea the person life is more important than anything in the world but I'm Palestinian and let me tell you what's really going on not what the press tells you and lie to you   First of all I support neither Hamas nor any other organization   when Israel gives a warning they just tell you 5 mins before the air strike , you can't dress your clothes , even though most of the Palestinians don't meet any Hamas fighter ( because Gaza strip is full of betrayers ) and if you take a look at the assassination of Saeed Seam the Minister of the Interior in Hamas government  you will realize what I'm talking about , that man got killed on the door of his house with his son just the moment after he arrives, every Palestinian knows that a snitch told Israel about him just when he arrives to his house, and after the war Hamas executed several people cause they're snitches   The Washington post talked about targeting the Palestinian houses few weeks ago, according to the journalist Israel asked Palestinians information about Hamas and threaded everyone who don't cooperate in marking his house as a target in any coming wars   One of Gaza strip neighborhoods got all destroyed. 400 houses are dust now; Israel didn't even give them a warning   yea media lie to all of us and control everything , Israel do gives warning some times and you have 5 minutes after getting the phone call to leave the house or you will be pieces   Things are pretty complicated here and the media will keep lying to us, anyway you can go to any neutral website like the BBC or Aljazeereglish.net to confirm all my info|`|qxteTM9Kaa	I would|`|CgGVpUI5aa	In a real war, thats what innocents do.

AA10783710	Wow, one of your respondents sure doesn't seem like she's stepped foot in the real world.    Society needs people who can do unpleasant work, monotonous work, tough physical work, dangerous work, lonely work, seasonal work, etc.  There are thousands of jobs I can't cite here, but what about:    *  Butchers (hard, dangerous, smelly)  *  janitors    *  maintenence men  *  dry wallers (this is a hellish job)  *  septic tank repair and drainage  (uggh!)  *  furnace repair  *  livestock (pigs, cows, horses) cleaner    How about this job?  Slime line workers!  Slime line workers cut fish open, rip out their guts and throw them down the line in a fish-processing plant. It sounds easy enough, but the conditions are pretty tough. Workers are in a cold plant where they stand all day, ankle-deep in fish blood and guts where they can easily cut themselves. Since their hands are covered in slime, its a certainty their cuts will get infected. One of the biggest negatives, however, is the smell. Plus the wage stinks, averaging less than $10 an hour.    Hazmat diver:  These scuba divers do the unthinkable; they swim in toxic material to perform repairs. Radioactive soup, oil spills, chemical spills, and raw sewage are all fair game in this horrible job.    Hospital laundry worker:  Besides being in a stifiling hot room all day with flies buzzing around the bigger problem is being exposed to every infectious disease that lives on hospital fabric.     Meat plant carcass splitters:  This job is as horrific as it sounds. These workers cut open cow and pig carcasses all day and remove their innards. Its definitely nasty, but heres the real horror: One out of three workers gets injured every year and often without compensation. They can maim themselves with their own cleaver or a factory blade. If knives dont get them, disease like E. coli and mad cow can.    Yes, these people deserve a living wage.  Paying enough for these necessary jobs will not reduce the number of people looking for higher education.  Anyone who thinks so is living in a fantasy world, and higher education is not for everyone.|`|3wyxasucaa	No one "deserves" anything.  It must be earned, through toil and sweat.

That way instead of paying a bunch of guys 7, we could hire more at 6. Instead of hiring 11 people making 7 an hour, we could hire 13 at 6, get more work done, and reduce the number of unemployed.|`|AWSmknxLaa	not everyone is motivated.  Many with opportunities/education do not utilize them.    You do not get what you deserve,  you get make what you can.    Baseball player does not derserve millions, but they take it     CNA deserves more than $9/hr but that is what it pays.    It is all about choices and free will|`|09neUq82aa	This is precisely the problem.    People who use terms like "lazy poor people" and "better themselves" have a hard time making the distinction between "everyone" being able to work themselves up the social ladder and "anyone" being able to do so.    Anyone can. Sure, I'll admit that. One or two people may get lucky and use business to rise a peg or two (he'll have to step on the heads of other poor people trying to do so of course).    But not everyone can. Say everyone did. Say everyone becomes an investment banker, a share-holder, whatever. Who's making the produce? Who's working the shipyards? Who's out on the trawlers? Who's in the mines? Who's in the factories?      Call me a Commie if you want. It won't change the truth.      I'm not advocating revolution. Socialism can't work without democracy, and the chances of a socialist revolution not being hijacked by some dictator are pretty slim.      I just wish the lucky few didn't have the audacity to accuse the workers of laziness.|`|2gCU3Csgaa	All people deserve a living wage.  We still need people that do jobs that pay less than a living wage.  Students and kids that don't want to go to school should do those jobs. Students should be cleaning journymens tools and be getting school credit for it.  So many teenagers drop out of school mainly because they want to be part of something real.  For them almost any job is real enough.      Even in an ideal world,  not every one can be educated to the same level.  For example, Mentally disabled people want jobs but the can't always do the math involved in cashiering.    Likewise in an ideal world nobody would be to proud to sweep the shop floor or help another in need.  So it could be possible that CEO would clean up the toilet to give a co-worker a break.    The way I see it is, The reason employers are not prosecuted is because the richest of people making tons of money off illegal immigrants pay campagin contributions  to do nothing about the law being broke.|`|t5hp4t79aa	What a great question. Finally, one that actually made me think. I think even if everyone were educated you would still see some discrepency between lifestyles. I mean, when I was in college not everyone was on teh same level 'intellectually speaking'. Some of those I knew in college have recently gotten great jobs, some are struggling even to get the Nterprise Rent A Car/Insurance sales jobs. As long as there is scarcity for specific goods there will always be competition. For the second part of your question; look at a country like Saudi. In Saudi it is concidered improper for a Saudi to do lower work. All the maids, street cleaners etc. are foreign. This would happen in any society where the majority of the people have become prosperous. If everyone in the U.S. suddenly got high paying jobs we would propbably NEED more immigrants to fill the lower paid positions. As it stands right now there are No Americans willing to do stoop work "berry picking etc" Hence, our agricultural picking/packing/processing sector is completely reliant on migrant worker, "mostly illegal" because even legal immigrants who speak almost no English won't work in thsoe conditions......    We need a good education system. A good education is something EVERYONE deserves......|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	There is a difference between a living wage and minimum wage.  Minimum wage is for entry-level employees who do not have any work experience or have poor work habits (chronic tardiness, poor performance, slow learning curve, lack of ambition, etc.).  A teenager who has never worked before can take a minimum wage job and start to develop their work skills.  The employer has to take on the task of training these people for the work force.    In most minimum wage jobs, the employee will get a raise some time in the first year of employment if their performance is good and they have good work habits.  By gaining experience, the employee is becoming a more valuable asset to a company.  That training and experience can be a stepping stone to other more responsible positions (and the pay increase that goes along with it).    Yes, everyone can have an education but that does not mean that everyone is automatically a good employee or does a good job in the field that they choose.  Not everyone is equally ambitious and willing to "go the extra mile".    Everyone HAS the opportunity to get an education now.  Some choose to make that sacrifice and some don't.  There are plenty of scholarships available.  There are community colleges that are very affordable.  My local community college charges $45 a credit hour and many companies have programs to assist with tuition.  We all have choices.  My cable TV bill is about $225 a quarter.  That would fund 5 credit hours if I choose to use my money that way instead of watching TV.    Someone who truly wants an education is not prevented from getting one.  It is a choice.|`|THRtsl83aa	No, they don't deserve what you call a "living wage" because that is something a freakin' high school kid can do part time for extra cash!  Don't you see that having lower wage jobs like fast food workers, cashiers, etc., is what helps motivate people to get an education to get a better paying job?  If you can live off the wage you get for being a maid, who would want to bother going to college to become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer?      BadgerFarm: The point is that young people (teens to 20s) willingly do those jobs to support themselves during school/college/early life.  They then move on to bigger and better jobs, leaving openings for the next group of youngsters to take their places.  It's a cycle.  Is it really that hard to understand?      Add: Employers who hire illegals should be prosecuted, fined, and jailed.  Employers will then stop hiring illegals, illegals will then stop coming due to lack of work, and employers will have to pay what Americans demand for that particular job.  What's the problem with that?  Pretty simple.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	If we need them badly enough, yes.    If they don't like the money they're making, get a better job.    If I can hire a cleaner for $7.50 an hour, why should I be forced to pay $10/hour?|`|JxYLnTGiaa	Your forgetting that by paying those workers a living wage, you are preventing the CEO's from eating lobster every night and buying their own personal Jets.     Come on!! CEO's need this stuff!|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Of course they do. The right wing doesn't understand that there will always been janitors, waiters, ... Then, if we are civilized, we need to help them survive.    Education is the key. As you learn about all the differences in the world, you become more tolerant and understand the issues.    Staying in the back country side of texas, taking care of cattle all day, without ever see what's out there, doesn't give you an overall view of things ... thus, you tend to listen to the people surrounding you, that have also no clue of what's out there.    In the end, there is no progress!!

To alleviate the abject poverty of many of his people, he quickly moved to nationalize the oil industry to utilize the profits to benefit Iranians. The British, who had significant oil interests in Iran, raised serious objections to Mossadeghs actions despite the obscene oil profits they had made over the years in Iran, his offer to compensate them for the oil infrastructure they had built, and the British governments recent nationalization of its own coal and steel industries.    While the existence of the Soviet Union as a rival world power precluded the use of direct military intervention by the United States, John Foster Dulles contrived a plan to crush the Socialist ambitions of Mossadegh. Disseminating propaganda through Americas mainstream media (including the New York Times and Time Magazine) which portrayed Mossadegh as a Communist while simultaneously utilizing the CIA to create a subversive environment in Iran, the United States succeeded in toppling Mossadegh and replacing him with the Shah of Iran. Representing US and Western business interests with great enthusiasm until he was deposed by radical Islamic elements in 1979, the Shah ruled Iran autocratically. SAVAK, his intelligence agency, tortured and murdered thousands of Iranian dissidents.    Like Hugo Chavez is in Venezuela, Mossadegh was anathema to American Capitalism. Leaders of developing countries who threaten the flow of capital to the Empire by diverting it to their own people quickly become enemies of the United States. The irony is that the replacement rulers America installs to preserve its economic interests are almost always corrupt and murderous dictators who foster deep hatred of the United States. Ultimately, Washington finds itself grappling with reactionary regimes which are overtly hostile to the United States, like the current leadership in Iran.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Obama extended his hand to Iran?!?

It makes up your AFQT score (which is your main score). Good Luck on your ASVAB!|`|AA11130104	They keep changing the scoring.  I think the max General Test (GT) score now is a 100 (this is an average of your scores from the various sections).    When I took it (1981) the max was 150 and I scored a 143.  I am not a super genius by any estimation.

Nobody passes, and nobody fails. It's simply an aptitude test to see what field you can do. For example, some people don't do so well with mathematics, but they do really well in reading and vocabulary, and vice-versa.    No matter your score, they try to match you up with a job. So if you don't do so well in math but you're good in vocabulary, they won't offer you any engineering jobs, but they could offer you a Public Relations job.|`|np9CdiaNaa	ya its really easy i took it nd im a jr n i did really well the only parts i didn't do that well were the electrician nd car sections otherwise it was easy

Instead of having a fair debate, if they can't refute your point, the Obamatons simply report you.  If the yahoo person reviewing your answer has the same bias, they just erase your answer!

The sad fact for these uninformed groupies is that cable TV and and satellite radio has nothing to do with the "public airwaves" and the Federal Communications Commission has no control over them, so to plan on the conservative voices being silenced is a pathetic wet dream.  Limbaugh, Hannity, FOX news are here to stay. Keep listening and whining about them, it's what keeps them going.
OYtoM9fXaa	You think Republicans are somehow immune from adversity?  Most of us have experienced tough times.  We just don't expect others to take care of us.  As far as foreclosure is concerned, why should I or anyone else pick up the tab for deadbeats?|`|G2auAv1Saa	I am a Republican so that means when it rains I walk between the rain drops and all the traffic stops for me.     Please, we are all people- we have all had crappy things happen to us. The difference (not just a rep or dem thing a person by person thing) is how you deal with it. I've been laid off before, but I knew it wasn't the only job in the world. You get laid off, you go job hunting- every day and every where no matter what the job is. You don't spend all your money when you are working and you save for bad days. And when something bad happens to you, you don't spend all your time looking for someone to blame you look for a way out of it. You cut your bills, a pack of ramen noodles is 13 cents and can sustain your life- drink tap water, don't do anything but look for another job, don't be afraid to tell your kids no, don't be afraid to shop at goodwill for an interview suit.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	What a presumptuous F*** thing to ask.  It is what you do in the face of adversity - not adversity itself.  This question is further proof that you have NO clue.  Something tells me you wouldn't know true adversity if it bit you on the a**.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Is that right?  My first husband died leaving me with 10s of thousands of debt.  I did lose my house in a short sell.  Not foreclosure because I acted before that happened.  I remember counting out nickels and dimes to go buy a can of soup for my daughter and I.  I did go on assistance for a short time in order to return to school.  That was only after selling everything I owned but my car and clothes and still couldn't pay off those debts.  I realized the only way I would be able to was to go back to college so I could earn more money.  I completed 2 years of graduate work in 9 months and worked part-time so the only assistance I accepted was medical coverage for my daughter.  I think I had it for me as well but I never used it.    I now own 3 businesses.  I could retire now if I wanted to and be very comfortable the rest of my life.  I was at the bottom and am now on top.  How?  Through hard work and determination.  So please don't tell me I don't know adversity.  I faced probably more than you ever will.|`|AA11598520	As a Republican on here, I can tell you that both my husband and his family, who are from Puerto Rico and me and my family have all faced adversity much as I'd like to be able to agree with you.     The thing is, the reason that we can pay our mortgage, for example, even as I....wait for it....don't have a job is because we planned for it and refused to include my income at the time we bought the house. If we had, we could have had a much nicer house and, apparently, could now get the government to pay for it. Honestly, had I realized the government would, I would have been in the house we really wanted instead of the one we could.....wait for it......afford. That's the way we were taught.     We DO have credit card debt, but I don't see the government willing to pay that off. I guess the demographics of credit card debt aren't right. Perhaps if Democrats weren't taught to believe that they are entitled to the government taking care of them for their life span, they wouldn't have so much adversity.    I could name other adversities I've personally gone through, let alone my family, like having to teach in a public school in the inner city for 7 long years until I decided the money wasn't worth my integrity since the administration couldn't care less whether those kids can read or not, and neither do they since the government has been taking care of them generation after generation, but you wouldn't believe any of it since, as a liberal, you mind is already made up and closed.    I even forgot to mention the cancer I got when my newborn was only 2 months old. I forgot to mention how, at 9 months, I had to move out of the house and have my inlaws stretch their income to come up from Florida to care for him for two weeks because I was too toxic from the meds to be in the same house with him. THAT'S how we face adversity.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	The Republicans are NOT ignoring "the suffering of others" they are trying to deal with it in a responsible manner that will get people back to work for a long time, not just until the federal funding runs out.  Again you prove just how ignorant you really are. I've been out of work for about 9 months. I live in Illinois, in Cook County, in Chicago. All these are run by Dummycrats who think that stealing more of our money(you know, the money we earn if there are jobs created by people with money) to fund the programs that wouldn't be necessary if they weren't stealing money from those who actually DO create jobs and create wealth.   If you would actually take some time to understand the economy you would know that the Democrats are just taking resources from the private sector that would actually produce something other than headaches and ulcers. That money could produce good sustainable jobs which people who are receiving unemployment benefits now, would get. Then they could be paying their taxes instead of taking more from the government who should just stick to doing what the constitution gives it the power to do. Government jobs don't provide the stimulus that private sector jobs would because government jobs are funded by the government, which is in turn funded by the private sector(the taxpayers). If the private sector isn't allowed to produce to its full potential the tax revenues go down. Then, of course, the Dummycrats say " Well, increasing taxes worked so well before, let's do it again." Then they just drain more and more from the source of their funding. It CANNOT be sustained for too long.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	George Bush -- born on third base and thought he hit a triple.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	I worked hard to avoid getting into that situation.

Those are Conservatives.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	When we accept the mythology that hard work will make us wealthy just like the ruling elite we embrace wannabeism. We want to be like the wealthy.  We want to support the rich ruling elite and the powerful, not because it is in our own best interest, rather, because we want to be like them.  Perhaps, the thinking goes, if Ms. Mornin only had five jobs instead of just three, she could join the rich club alongside the Bushs, Kennedys, Kerrys, Guilianis, Saudis, etc., of the world.  While the working class is duped into struggling to be like the rich, power is passed on from generation to generation via inherited wealth.  Sons are given access to the best schools, given companies to play with, bailed out when misdeeds are committed and transgressions expunged.  Being wealthy means never having to take responsibility.  Being part of the elite means never having to say you're sorry.  Being born into wealth means never having to do  either.|`|uithGZOwaa	You assume a lot,  considering you most likely have no idea about the lives of anybody on this forum,  regardless of their party affiliation.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	I face my challenges head-on and I never seek public assistance.

I'm the product of a single parent home, I live with my mother now with my husband and my son, because it's cheaper to live with family than it is to live on our own and get welfare.

Instead of whining, I went back to school to finish my degree, and now I am making 4 times what I did at the other company.  I guess being laid off from my job because the company was bought out doesn't count as adversity to you?    Also, when my husband and I purchased our house, we did not get an adjustable rate, because we actually did research and realized it is better to go with the safe thing, eventhough an ARM had lower rates at the time.  We bought a house that we could afford, not one to impress everyone.    I certainly don't ignore the suffering of others, and I completely understand that people need help sometimes, however what you libs seem to ignore is the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are dishonest and milk the system.  I also don't think we need 300 million dollars in a stimulus package for STD prevention.|`|scw6bBo7aa	As opposed to the libs who face adversity and have no clue how to deal with it?

We have raised a whole generation of people who have gotten 8th place ribbons all their life, that they have none of the skills necessary to deal with adversity or failure in the real world, where there actually are winners and losers, and not everybody can do everything.

Liberals believe in Nanny Government, handouts and blaming others for their personal problems.    I know many Conservatives who have failed in small businesses, and then started all over again, learning from their mistakes, and then succeed with hard work and personal sacrifice.    Liberals only want others to sacrifice and work hard so they can sit on their butts. Liberals learned long ago that it is much easier to whine and complain, than it is to actually do anything to fix their own problems.     Maybe if Liberals were taught "personal responsibility" at an early age, then they wouldn't need Congress to try and give them all that free STD and abortion money in the new stimulus bill.|`|9RXS67Mmaa	I am a republican, and have had 2 heart attacks, lost my home through the last divorce, have a son who hates me.

I have been on government assistance during the health problems, and the state is providing my health insurance at this time. We got off food stamps as soon as we could. I think assistance is just that, not a way of life as some like to live for years on the government dole. I am very familiar with adversity, unlike our leaders who claim to have been there but have no clue what it is like to have to worry where their next meal is coming from, or if they will be able to pay the bills. It's all how you handle it, government assistance is there for all, and as long as it is needed, it is great to have it. When the need is no longer there, get off it so someone else can have a chance to get the help they need.

In CA, a notary cannot legally perform marriages without being a minister.|`|AA11206283	Any priest, minister, or rabbi of any religious denomination, of the age of 18 years or over may perform marriages. --- Ministers must complete the marriage license and return it to the county clerk within 4 days after the marriage. --- For questions see the county clerk.|`|AA11828439	They can not.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Interesting question .. ask any notary public.. there you will find your answer..
Vpq8CZQHaa	NO!!  Unfortunately, anchor babies have been pawns in this game for a long time.  Perhaps the majority of citizens against this should sue Obummer to enforce the immgration laws and expedite the deportation of ALL illegals!|`|s519vyP5aa	I SUPPORT it its not the kids fault that the parents came to the us to look for a better Future for there kids all of thous that but down them immigrants have no idea how it is to live in thous country were some are dyeing from hunger or so many other things you don't understand stop the hate and share some of the good of america .. YEAH for the kids to fight for what they belive in ..and hope    ya seem to forget an immigrant discovered america Christopher Columbus was an immigrant.. the USA is made of immigrants..    every one knows that the children can not make them legal even if they were born here .. only the president/congrass can do that if HE WANTS its there disicion not the childrens..    yeah but thous perants that are separated from there children here are either abuse or some other stuff not just because .. yeah there are some kids that are starving here to but thats now .. it wasn't like this its all the money that they were sending to the war that might had missed things up over here.|`|AA12392755	There should be so such thing as "anchor babies".

RIDICULOUS.|`|WBDsKwylaa	some are dyeing from hunger or so many other things you don't understand - You think only Mexico has this problem ? People in the US are dying and so many other things you do not grasp. What makes these kids so special that their parents can break laws with no consequences and what about kids in America separated from their parents shall they all start a movement now that if you have kids the laws do not apply.Where do these kids get thousands of dollars for this kind of lawsuit, this money could feed thousands in Mexico if they are really straving to death.America has bigger problems than their parents.Obama cannot just causally stop the deportations, and adopt new immigration laws, it has to go through congress or Bush would have done this long ago|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	That need to take those children and their lawyers and throw them in the in the bottom of the ocean.

I think this past election was fair to the extent that the margin was significant enough to OVERCOME voter caging, non-certified electronic voting machines and unjustified routing of tabulations to 'middle man' servers (GOP election practices).  As for ACORN, if there was voter fraud they should be held accountable.  Thus far, all I've seen is individuals padding voter registrations to turn more in and get paid more money.  It was ACORN that reported those cases, then the GOP turned around and vilified them for reporting those discrepancies.  It was wrong of those individuals to turn in fake registrations, but show me where "Mickey Mouse" actually cast a fraudulent vote.  -- Voter Caging, etc.  http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/330/index.h...  http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/330.ht...    -- Ex-US Attorney: ACORN Probe a Scare Tactic  http://www.democracynow.org/2008/10/17/h...  -- GOP Email Warns Obama Victory Could Lead to Second Holocaust  http://www.democracynow.org/2008/10/27/h...|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i would HOPE that this gets booted.  that would be insane!|`|eWObKmBSaa	I would like to hear about this Acorn bailout, please talk more of it.

dcWN4v6Jaa	Wow, that was great thanks. I answered your previous question by the way.|`|OSF2WMQeaa	hippies these days.|`|YoAv0uOLaa	Hippie trash
HvKDkiPaaa	Yes. It's called the Kivu Conflict and sadly Western media isn't covering it. There is this guy called Laurent Nkunda and he was a colonel in the "Rally for Congolese Democracy" faction. A previous war ended in 2003 in the Congo and he joined the national forces of the transitional government. In 2004, they made him a general. Then he rebelled and is being supported by Rwanda. He's hiding out in the forests of a region of Congo called Nord-Kivu, attacking villagers.     The Democratic Republic of Congo is currently being supported in their efforts to stop Nkunda by Rwandan rebels, Mai-Mai militias (A tribe of Congo), Angola, Zimbabwe, the Hutu (a tribe from Rwanda), and the UN.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	There is always a war in Congo and it's always about tribalism.|`|DibFrwxlaa	At the end of the day, it's about the vast mineral wealth in the Eastern Congo.  Everyone wants a piece of the action.    The fallout from the Rwandan genocide is part of it too.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Yes.  I understand it's just a continuation of the Rwandan genocidal war.  Expect much more of that.    Asia and Africa was going into famine from it's usual cause, overpopulation, in the mid 20th century.  That was the root of the Viet Nam war.  The only place in Asia with excess rice was the Mekong Delta.    The strategic importance of that region was eliminated in the the early 1970's when rice yields were tripled by scientists in the Philippines.    Africa and Asia have tripled their population since, putting themselves back into trouble.  Central Africa is the most populated and therefore one of the most likely for more genocidal wars.  Those always have been the traditional way to get more essential land for the future population.  There isn't another way once most of your connected wilderness is gone, tapped out, or already reserved for future population.|`|8twsa18Iaa	yeh my family had to move to zambia cos of it

Trust me, he will just be glad to see you.|`|raImBqwraa	Let me tell you a story. Now, this is a true story, so to protect the privacy of those involved, I'm going to change some names.    This is a story about a Marine named, er, "KEGGERS," now, Keggers went on a little cruise to the desert for a party, see? And Keggers came back to California after awhile, right? And there was this girl there, who was dressed up nicely for Keggers, and that wasn't bad - except that in this case, you can read "Nice" as "Like a w**re*" and see the problem that happened here. Think Keggers ever heard the end of that? No. Not for a long time.     Moral of the story is - dress nice, but certainly don't dress "Up," If he has a favorite outfit of yours or anything, wear that, but FFS dont' go out there dressed like an attention-wh**ing skank, you'll see them there, and it's disgusting. It's much more important that you, er, have something special to wear for him AFTER the whole coming home ceremony, if you get my drift...|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Wear only a smile
wQ5LKysaaa	It is the product of the successful demoralization of this nation by the mainstream media.  I'm starting to get tired of the reference, but for my lack of imagination, I'll put it like this:  the mainstream media are the stirrers of that massive pitcher of Kool-Aid!    Their power over the public is astounding.  First, they put a negative slant on everything regarding our nation for years.   Next, they found the "answer" to all the ailments they had been reporting, and finally, began their love-affair Obama.  I was dumbfounded when I actually watched Chris Matthews announce on television that he believes it's "his job" to make sure that the Obama Presidency is successful.  Say what?!    For the sake of this nation that I love, I will pray that Obama is successful.  God help us all.  But Matthews' credibility as a journalist is non-existent!  If anyone had come out and said that about Bush.....well, I'll leave THAT to your imagination.    The mainstream media has such a large part of the population unmercifully bamboozled.  I honestly think that many Americans expect Obama to just make everything go away; they expect that he will make some marvelous speech full of indecipherable promises, looking down on his flock while they chant "O-BA-MA...O-BA-MA...O-BA-MA"; then our new President will lift his arms in a wide wave, and all the horrible things of this world will vanish.    The way the masses worship him and his acceptance of it sickens me.  It's dangerous!|`|5hxWSezPaa	Ahhh, but he IS the chosen one!|`|Q3TGJMdkaa	Thats because liberals don't believe in God and have him instead|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I think he's just a man nothing more, nothing less.|`|pW7KuT87aa	Well conservatives believe in god and look what that has gotten us.|`|1f2ab14ef5ed92e673a1f5db9d7d9463aa	Its where the news has taken him.    He represents "change" to those still suffering due to slavery, and oppression because of his color.    He represents "change" to those wanting a good family life - look at his own family and strength. America has crashed and burned on this due to divorce rates & single parenting issues.    He is just a person in reality. It's the news that has brought him up to where he is. Nothing more. People want to believe that in a flailing economy we can have change in every aspect not only a few of them. Rolls eyes.....to me he's just another politician not working toward middle class american best interests.|`|rttm1SLaaa	I haven't seen one person or heard from one who does.  I don't know who you're talking about.  I'm an Obama supporter, and I'm realistic about how good of a job he'll do.  I think he'll definitely benefit the country, and I think he'll make GWB look like the know-nothing president he really was, but it wont be a massive shift occurring in the course of a couple of years.  We might see large changes at the end of 4 years, definitely at the end of 8 years, but it'll be a while, and I know that.  I don't care about the color of his skin, all that matters in that regard is the historical precedent (had he been born 40 years earlier, he never could have become senator, let alone president).  The shirts, buttons and such are just supportive, just as any president has been supported.  He has a large following because people believe he can make a difference, and why is that bad?  Why shouldn't the majority of the country believe so heavily in their leader?    By the way, you destroy your own point towards the end of your question.  When you say that responding with "anybody is better than Bush" is foolish, and then follow that up by saying Obama is brainwashing us, you're not helping yourself.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	They don't.      There's just enthusiasm about him since he is different from Bush and will do things differently in Washington, setting a different tone.    It's not just "better than Bush," it's because he is setting the new tone in Washington.  No brainwashing necessary.  People are ready for a new tone and a desire to get things done.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	they're deluded|`|JxYLnTGiaa	He seems like a nice guy, plus he is tough.    That's rare in politics.

5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The bottom line is that California spends money it doesn't have and can't get and then accrues liabilities it can't pay for.  It either needs an income tax or a drastic reduction in spending.     California has been acting like the federal government.  If  you need to do something, do it; if you cant afford it, do it anyway and borrow the money to pay for it; if you cant borrow the money, raises taxes; if you still dont have enough money to pay for what  you spent, impose an entertainment tax on all your celebrities.  After all, almost all of them are liberals and they will surely be glad to be major contributors to the effort to restore Californias solvency.    Also, California should impose a huge tax on San Francisco for violating U.S. immigration laws by declaring itself a sanctuary city.  It is an embarrassment to the state to have a renegade city.    Next, California should draw up a budget that is realistic and prioritizes expenditures.  If the state sees its going to come up short on revenues, react to it in a timely manner; dont wait until the hole is already $40 billion in debt.    Finally, California should calculate its costs for harboring illegal aliens and send a bill to the home home countries for that cost.  If their own countries won't pay, send the illegals home so they can help out here.  They sure aren't helping out here.|`|nr96BgWfaa	No, it's not right.    Guess Obama has no respect for his voter base - he's refusing to bail us out!|`|AA11103371	Because they have an idiot for a governor.|`|k6hicodfaa	It's the legacy of a celebrity Republican Governor.|`|3MM64geHaa	Because Arnold acted like a Dem. He taxed and taxed and taxed and kept spending on useless social programs. California laws are very unfriendly to businesses.  They have created an environment  that the only thing that will grow is the need for a "bail out"|`|AA12212403	California has some proposition thing and has had it for ages that prevents certain property taxes from being increased.  I think (could be wrong) that the taxes can only go up if a home is sold and then the new taxes are based on that.  So, municipalities can't do cost of living increases and some people are getting away with paying tremendously low taxes.  This was supposed to help people, but in the end it's hurting them as schools and libraries have had to close.  Government needs money to run, no doubt, but reasonable government makes sense.    I think I could be quite right on this, but I do not live in CA and a resident might have a better answer.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Only a fool thinks that the current government is the main problem.  How soon people forget the huge budget issues California was having with Gray Davis as governor. The problems stem from too much money being dumped into liberal programs.

Lets just say I break into a house and steal 2,000 dollars worth of stuff.  I will definitely get a jail term.  Why should a white collar criminal who steals tens of thousands or even millions get off lightly.  Both crimes produced victims.  The victims of the white collar crime may be people who lose their jobs due to layoffs or the closing of buildings.  Elderly retirees loose pension funds.  Just because someone steals and had a college degree does not make them any better than a illiterate kids who breaks into a house.  Maybe the white collar prisoners should be made to teach in jails....not ethics...that might help incarcerated people get job skills.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Ask Koslowski, former CEO of Tyco, 4 years deep in an 8 year stretch.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	They absolutely should go to jail.

Not even white-collars.|`|AA11450062	Sure and how about jailing the illegal employers that hire illegals that give them the motivation to come here in the first place.|`|RAjycr4waa	Yes they deserve to serve time. But I don't believe they should have to serve time along with "violent' criminals. Thats why they go to Club Fed.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	Yes they should. It might help keep "Bubba" in line.
t3QAaSN9aa	If you were actually expecting instantaneous solutions to the huge messes created by the Bush administration, then you will be very disappointed.  President Obama can't work miracles.     As you no doubt know, the situation in Afghanistan has been allowed to deteriorate to the point of crisis due to the unnecessary diversion of resources to Iraq. Our military is stretched.  I recently read a report about the increased number of waivers over the past few years in order to allow felons into the army.  This can't be good. Even reducing the number of troops in Iraq can't address such military problems and redeploying them to Afghanistan will be throwing them into a situation that has been badly handled for years.      There are no easy solutions.    Edit:  Obama said throughout his campaign that we need to send more troops to Afghanistan, so I am not sure what some people think they heard.|`|mkEGjlmNaa	He is now planning a troop surge in Afghanistan    Wasn't he the one screaming to everyone that would listen that the troop surge wouldn't work    THE MAN IS A FRAUD    Big surprise  -- libs love Kool-aid|`|eulMjLtPaa	Sigh...    Obama's platform throughout the campaign was to draw down out of Iraq over the next 16 months, and put the fight where it really belongs: in Afghanistan, where we would be fighting the actual people who attacked us.|`|wtcAK31Paa	Yep. I'm happy. But isn't Pakistan supplying terrorist with weapons? Didn't Obama bomb Al Qaeda in Pakistan? Do you want Pakistan to help get our soldiers killed????    I believe you are being very unAmerican.You terrorism supporter|`|mL1yi935aa	The War in Iraq will end in 2010, but the War in Afghanistan will continue until the threat is thwarted.    I think he will get other countries to help us in Afghanistan.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Ah yes. Campaign rhetoric. Unfortunately for us, his followers were uninformed enough to buy into his crap.     What I thought was interesting was his promise to return to fiscal responsibility, to go through each budget and spending bill with a fine toothed comb and cut the wasteful pork. And then I see these 'stimulus' bills that are bulging with pork and I ask, "Well, where's that comb? Where's that promised fiscal responsibility, that cut in wasteful spending?"     Still more of the same. You'll have to excuse me now. I need to go out to my online dictionary and look up the word 'change'. It seems I had the meaning wrong.|`|AA11518835	I don't know if you noticed, but Obama is shipping tens of thousands of troops to Afghanistan.    The war in Iraq has been seeing draw-downs for the last six months, because it is almost over.     Pay attention to the news, dear.|`|JxYLnTGiaa	Yeah|`|wbJXqkVGaa	LOL..I must admit you nailed it!!:-P|`|BquqToGaaa	Obama is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. I think people have forgotten about polticians keeping their promises. it's been awhile since we had a president who actually did that.

Nice going B.O.!     Putting the world at risk, thats the change B.O. was talking about!|`|oNEi61iLaa	Obama has alway said: end the occupation of Iraq, escalate the war against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. No one should be surprised by this. This is a president who has always condemned the Iraq War which was a huge and unnecessary distraction, and criticized his predecessor for neglecting the war in Afghanistan (you know, against the people who actually attacked us).    I'm horrified by the other answers here. People are REALLY stupid.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Aha, yes. Pull out American troops so the the Muslims can come bomb us. Brilliant idea Mr. President.|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	all I hear out of his mouth is BS promises about the middle east and diplomacy, he won't do ****.|`|GNNh52OMaa	I continue to hear his sheep chanting "change........change....change......"    and those that didn't vote based on color are so embarrassed that they cannot admit their mistake because they can no longer use the excuse he is "not even president yet!"    it would be easier on dems if they just admit that they knew this guy was just another politician, after all!|`|3wyxasucaa	But now we'll be drafted to go to Iran.|`|OlCr3iNFaa	Yes.  I am very happy.   The US should give it up and embrace Islam.  It is a religion of love and peace.  After they bomb the ******out of us we will see that it is so and become faithful followers of Allah.|`|Y7RbTYNvaa	I hope you this question is intended as sarcasm.  Obama is gearing up to send many troops to Afghanistan.|`|ho4skDEdaa	He's going to get into another war I bet|`|sGpEe35Haa	Good luck. Peace|`|BImIMnbzaa	Sending in an additional 30,000 troops does not exactly sound like he's putting anything to rest.    I do believe that he and Gates need to explain to the American people why he is expanding this Afghanistan war at a time when Karzai criticizes everything we attempt to do, and all this while he and Putin are blowing in each others ear about the possibility of Russia becoming involved in the Afghanistan problem.    Putin wants more influence in the region, after all, Mother Russia shares a whole bunch of border with Afghanistan, and to them it makes sense to be more involved, while the US is less involved !

dHjya1Yoaa	Not to the degree that it is all our doing that the earth is changing... I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I went to OU for my Meteorology degree and worked in the Geology Library for the 4 years I was there and then ended up graduating with my B.Sc. in Geography with a Minor in Metr and so I am biased from my education to believe that the Earth is warming on it's own... whether it is geophysical or astrophysical... and that we are only helping it along, but to what degree we don't know...     Global Climate Change is a result of warming trends that are geophysical, astrophysical as well as anthropogenic... Neither is the absolute nor only cause of the Climate's Change... and the Earth WILL correct the warming trend when certain things have happened...     One of the corrective mechanisms the earth has is this thing called the Thermohaline Circulation in the Oceans.... It depends on the waters salinity to move water around the globe (one of the reasons why winters are usually mild in Europe but bitterly cold in the America's Northeast at the same latitudes... Once the ice caps in the Arctic melt (and if the methane released from the ice doesn't kill us) then there will be tons of fresh water dumping into the very salty ocean... which will cause the Thermohaline to stop circulating.... and when it does the cold water cannot be transported south and the warm water north and as a result another Ice Age will begin... possibly to the point of another Snowball Earth...|`|AXNkmdbKaa	You are using big words but I am not certain you understand "consensus".  There is not one to agree with.  You need a hearing aid.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	Consensus? HA HA HA HA HA HA 650 ACTUAL CLIMATOLOGISTS just announced that the climate change scam is a gigantic fraud.|`|UaC1fQd5aa	If you're referring to the 31,000+ that have signed a petition against our going along with the UN's position, yes I agree!    No, But when you have a population of respected scientists that large (almost 10k of them PhD's), that all agree that man's interference plays little or no part in this cyclical climactic situation...I'll go with that majority.    BTW: that's just in the US...I'm willing to bet there is a equal percentage of reasonable members of the scientific community worldwide|`|6Gfz125Paa	You know this whole thing is screwed up when politics comes into science.     Funny how scientists never argued about this stuff before the politicians came along.|`|lEaT5q06aa	sorry, i am misinformed, but this will help to make an estimate of % of believers|`|OYtoM9fXaa	1) There is no "consensus" on the subject.  2) Let's pretend for a second there were...so what?  There was once a consensus that the earth was the center of the universe.  How did that work out?|`|SWkaGJpgaa	There is no "scientific consensus" on it. And the belief that "scientific consensus" means anything scientifically is ludicrous.     It is empirical data, not "consensus" that determines the scientific truth. And the empirical data do not support this hysteria about man-made climate change.|`|MEReSvZeaa	"Consensus" is a buzzword.    Liberals use it whenever 2 or 3 people agree and they didn't bother to ask anyone else.    Whenever you hear that word, question everything that follows (and hold on to your wallet).  It's a scam.    Here's a hint:  whenever you want to have a REAL consensus on climate change, ask the planet for it's opinion.  Right now, it's cooling off.  Sorry, bud, earth has veto power.|`|THRtsl83aa	I'm a conservative who knows that your claim of a consensus is false.  I agree with Islam Delenda Est.

AA11744200	Did you know that many of the people that signed that worthless petition have asked to have their names removed from it because their signatures were acquired under misleading circumstances?|`|xagiOb80aa	Little do some know that while earth has endured climate change, previously, it is also fact that 90% of earth's history has much warmer temperatures and higher sea levels.    Further, our atmosphere has continuously been affected and changed by the activities of organisms and ecosystems.    In fact, glacial-intergalcial periods (we are currently in such a regime) are very rare, and linked to major ecologic/evolutionary changes.  The first documented glaciation is ~1.8 billion years ago and linked to oxygenation by stromatolites.  A second glacial period came about around 250 million years ago due to the advent of coal forests and swamp.    Marked periods of increased warming (which persists often for millions of years) is linked to increased greenhouse gases from various sources.|`|AA11373201	This the basic point you miss.    Humans are not causing the climate on Earth to change.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	global warming is a lie,common sense can tell you that.al gore has no scientific background and his crockumentary was full of lies.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I think that word is too big for your vocabulary.    Try this one:  coco puffs.    I think you'll experience less pain and dizziness.    (The question is not what credentials the signers have, the question is does the planet agree?)|`|EPqnB7Epaa	The Earth is 4.6 billion years old and has undergone constant climate change throughout it's existence.      Prove me wrong.|`|DR29KV1taa	Those "climatologists" are all bought and paid for with grants.  They say what they're told because they don't want to lose their grant money.  Real scientists have been disproving global warming for years now.|`|AA11130104	I'm one of the signatories of that petition.  I'm an Environmental Geologist, and have been for 6 years.  I am not a climatologist, but I have a ridiculous amount of training in paleo-geology, which encompasses paleo-climate.    I will never make a prediction about future climate, but I can talk you to death about past climate.    The big thing you notice when you look at paleo-climate is that CO2 is a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator (for you, that means that the rising temperature causes the rising CO2, not the other way around).  There is also about an 800 year lag in the CO2 levels.  So what we are seeing right now are representative of climate conditions from around about the year 1209.  What was going on at that time....hmmm...possibly the Medieval Warming Period....hmmmm.    Also, my educational background is a BS in Geology and an MS in Environmental Science.    I agree...I do not know as much as someone with a doctorate in climatology.  However, if you talk to someone with a doctorate in climatology who is honest, and hasn't bought into the god complex, he will tell you that Climatology is a new science and is in a state of flux similar to the condition that Geology was in in the late 1800's.    I do, however, consider myself to be as well versed in the scientific method as anyone you can find.  From this I know that if an experiment or method is not transparent and not reproducible, it is not valid.    I have yet to come across anyone who was able to reproduce any of the results that the AGW screamers claim to achieve.  I also know that Hansens former boss at NASA came out today and stated that Hansens claims were bogus and his methodology was fundamentally flawed.
AA11041009	Yes, I'm currently in the process of doing just that.  In fact, I have an MA in a soft science. One can apply for OCS, I've been told, after a year or so of service, at least in the USMC.  That is my plan.      Good luck!    Edit: Also, your recruiter will ask you to affirm your sanity, and he'll force you talk to an officer recruiter.|`|BImIMnbzaa	You are not prevented from enlisting, even degreed.  You may feel a bit over educated around a few of your fellow recruits, but you will also be there with people of your same IQ level.  Your chances for rank are much better than average, and you may qualify for at least E-3, once out of basic.    A recruiter can tell you more !|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	yes you can enlist and not use your education for officer rank and have it as NCO rank instead. unless they've changed that too since I was in.|`|qe0RNp7xaa	Yes|`|kxSz1PYmaa	Of course you can go enlisted with a degree.  My husband did so with the intention of going enlisted 1st to earn the respect of his fellow soldiers and then go to OTS.  You will start with a higher rank E4.  Of course you can decide to go to OCS at the start as well...the pay is a lot better or you can look into the Warrant program as well and go immediately to flight school and be trained as a helicopter pilot.|`|AA12096158	You can enlist in any service and go through boot camp.  It will be suggested that you go on to OCS but no one can make you.    What field is your degree in?    If it is a Navy specialty you are looking into have you looked into the Coast Guard?  Same jobs, smaller service.  I spent over 20 years in and managed to get everywhere from the 72 Olympics to Japan and 2 trips to Antarctica|`|o9dMd2rBaa	You don't ENLIST as an officer. You Commission as an Officer.     No, you can still enlist in the military with a degree. If you join the Army for example, you can join a Specialist (E4) instead of a Private (E1)|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	Have served in the Navy with many enlisted personnel that had college degrees.   There's nothing stopping you from enlisting with a degree.  It might be a good idea to get into a rating that's in the same field as the Officer career that you wanted to enter though.  Once in you can always apply for OCS, and if that doesn't work out, and if you don't mind being enlisted for at least 8 years, you can always apply for LDO, which is why you might want to get an enlisted rating that's in the same field as the Officer career you wanted to pursue, since LDO's become officers working in the same field they had while enlisted.|`|VbU9gVeKaa	After I graduated college, I enlisted in the ARMY and started out as an E-4 (specialist)  You can absolutely join the military without having to become an officer, and if you change your mind later, you can always go OCS, at anytime after your training.  If you have student loans, the army has student loan repayment programs, which is what you'll find most people did if they enlisted with a degree.     Although the pay is better as an officer, the best officers i've met were enlisted first.  And if you do choose the enlisted path, your degree will help you when you try to become an NCO, (in the army a civilian degree is worth 100 promotion points).|`|mxXwQRfxaa	A degree gives you the option to commission as an officer.  It is by no means a requirement.  I knew plenty of enlisted people who had college degrees.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	There are many enlisted people with degrees.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	You don't have to go officer, but the pay is much better. Perhaps you could go navy officer and cross train when the position is accepting? There are rules about cross training as far as the time you've been in your position, etc., but it might be a good option. Once you're enlisted, you could also apply and get picked up for Officer Training School if you choose to go that route eventually. Good luck.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Just what is the nature of your degree? If your training requires you to be an officer in the armed forces then you must take a commission to work at your chosen profession.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	You may join as an Enlisted person. You would go in as an E-4, or you may try for being a Commissioned Officer...    I respect the officers who were enlisted first a lot more than the ones right out of college.    But you get paid a lot more as an officer and you have more responsibility.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	No you do not have to be an Officer because you have a Degree.  There is lots of Enlisted personnel who have a degree or several.|`|gYTggPu0aa	You would join as an E4.  You are eligible to apply for Officer's Candidate School.  If you do not get it when you first join you can re-apply while on active duty.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Oh my god. You're making such a huge mistake. I guess I'll let you find that out though. Go ahead. You can absolutely enlist with a 4 yr degree. However, you'll kick yourself in the nutz for doing it. Any job as an officer is better than all jobs in the enlisted category in my experience.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	No, you can enlist even though you have a degree. Keep in mind, doing so put you in a much lower salary position and no privileges of rank.|`|hWq5bxoyaa	You can join anyway and advance from there. You   will be advanced as time and jobs open up. At least you will already be there|`|rMDHNPnEaa	You don't enlist as an officer...they are separate things.    Enlisted people enlist  Officers are commissioned.    Yes you can enlist with a degree...but if you want to go officer you should wait until the job opens up. The pay is better and so are some of the benefits.    It is actually harder to go in as an Officer and you do need a degree for it...however you can have a degree as an enlisted person and a lot of enlisted people have degrees. It is just not mandatory for enlisted people, however the Navy started making enlisted people get degrees when they get to Chief and above. (E7/E8/E9)

This means that law enforcement, after presenting the information to the local district attorney must be presented to a judge to decide if there exists "probable cause"    If the court gives the order and considering that she was a minor would have to be carried out 1) with the parents present, 2) by a doctor and 3)  allowing the "accused" to have counsel if desired.    Arizona has long been a state known for egregious human rights violations and disregard for due process.|`|AA11481224	nope when on school property the school officials are responsible for you and can consent for you|`|Y0O6971laa	Yes; they even need parental consent for drug tests.

They can hold the kid and notify the police to deal with it.

If you haven't figured out by now that giving tax cuts to the rich, and none to the poor, is going to "trickle down (which it never has and why they call it Voodoo Economics), you are wrong.    The economy works from the bottom up and 1/2 million a month are losing jobs!    I loved his part about the top 50% pay most of the taxes in this country. What he didn't tell you is that the top 50% is anyone making over $44,000 (between $44,000 and $100,000 are the majority of taxpayers, not the rich!)!    His arguments are simplistic and factually false.    I am tired of having the rich steal from the poor.    And how are all these Republicans now claiming they are fiscally conservative. They had Republican presidents for 28 years of the past 40. Not one came close to a balanced budget, and EVERY ONE of them ran up massive deficits. They are the reason we are where we are. All this demagoguery is pathetic!    My suggestion to you is to look past the phony rhetoric and learn something about economics!    And I am not attacking you!|`|MWJOEikkaa	I am against the stimulus from the gate.  People need to learn not to live beyond their means.  I payed my quarterly taxes with it last time most people payed their debts with it. This plan is beating a dead horse I do not care how different they say it was from the last stimulus.  I am against the bail out too. I own business some failed I did not get rewarded I paid by-myself every red penny back!  I am tierd of hand outs but I will give you a hand UP!|`|IuMdsIHUaa	Good points. Totally agree.      Notice the market is up today. But keep in mind that this is only part of the EMPTY HOPE factor. Nothing has been done yet. Just goes to show people will fall for anything won't they. Putting the cart before the horse.    Keep posting kid, your doing great!    As for the poster who suggested "learn something about the economy" the best education is PRACTICE! I am 48 years old, and no college class in theory has the answer to economics! Because we are dealing with factors such as corporate waste, greed, corruption! Theory is good on paper, but NOT IN PRACTICUM!|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	I think you misunderstand.  Obama told us the plan is to deepen/lengthen/worsen the recession.* This will make people more amenable to having government "run" the economy.  So, since there's no new ideas in it, ALL of it's been done and is already PROVED to deepen/lengthen/worsen recessions, I'd say it's no boondoggle. It's a perfectly workable plan.

I don't understand why people still think its a good thing.  In theory, it does seem wonderful.  Unfortunately, practical application has ruled it a dismal failure.  Robbing from Peter to pay Paul seems not so bad, but when you start doing this, you quickly run out of Peters, and end up with nothing but Pauls.    I wonder if its some kind of arrogance in peoples part, that makes them assume that while every other group of people in history have tried it and failed, they feel that THEY can make it work.    Look what's happened in the U.S. to our education system.  We socialized that and its a dismal failure, a money pit.  The U.S. has one of the worst education systems in the world.  Third world country's have better schools than the U.S.  Now people want to do that to health care, and more.

Socialism works on the premis     "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"    For this to actually work, every individual would have to work and provide up to his ability.  There could be no slackers, no lazy people, no gaming or taking advantage of the system.  If an individual didn't live up to this standard, then how could we possibly no what his/her needs are.    Now human nature being what it is, if something is given to you, then why should you have to work for it.    Now I am not saying that everybody is equal in there abilities, but if you can be a carpenter, or mechanic, or what ever, then you cannot have a choice to be lazy. otherwise you aren't  living up to your ability.    It really is the problem that we have in the US.  There are a lot of people that are gaming the welfare system (users and providers) that is making the system cost a lot more than what it is, and the government is just as guilty.

xaEcAgTqaa	There isn't always a passport check when flying to the UK from Ireland. However passport control are being phased in, so there is no guarantee that you won't need one.     Regardless of whether there is a passport control, you will need a visa to enter the UK legally, as your Irish visa is not valid to travel there, unlike with the Schengen visa system in Europe.    I.e. If you are very lucky you could slip through a crack in the system, but traveling without a passport & visa is definitely not advisable as you will be subject to all kinds of ugly deportation proceedings if you should be caught.

I am not trying to be insensitive but maybe people should not try to live beyond their means and buy affordable homes instead of the mansions that everyone seems to want.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Hard working evicted people can always squat if it's such a good deal.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Excellent question!  Typically squatters get rights only if they have openly lived on the property and claimed it as their own for 20 years or more.  At that point, the law says that the original landowner has not defended his rights and therefore those rights lapse.    The idea is that if someone has been allowed to live there as owner for such a long period, it's more fair, and/or more efficient for society not to turn back the clock.  The owner could have put up a fence, but did not.You snooze, you lose.    That's the rationale.  Whether I agree 100% or not with it is another question.    PS  People who promised to make mortgage payments and did not have violated a contractual agreement.  If the mortgagee waits 20 years to declare a default, the mortgagors may get to stay also.    Is it "fair" in a universal sense?  I'll leave that issue for another time.    PPS  Mortgagors would receive back the equity built up in the house (the payments), after all expenses of foreclosure were deducted.  If the house value declined, though, it's possible that they would get back nothing.  But they would not be in any worse financial position than people who actually paid for their houses and saw their home's value decline.|`|AA11988604	the squatters didn't borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars to occupy a house they can no longer pay for|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Why should hard working people be evicted when squatters have rights?      Think about it!
elY5vkVyaa	The law is a disgrace, once people are in or on your property you are forced to pay thousands - even tens of thousands - of pounds to get rid of the stinking parasites.    It's one thing for squatters to move into an abandoned house (there are a lot of them in some poorer towns and Cities) and look after the property while living in it but it's a scandal when they effectively steal land or buildings that are still maintained; there are a lot of elderly people who own a bit of land or a small second home that they may have had to leave unattended for a couple of years and then the local scumbags decide they're going to have it. Even when they are finally evicted, which can take YEARS, the property may be vandalized beyond recovery.    Personally I would use liberal amounts of physical force to get rid of them but not everyone has that option.|`|AA11206283	The law does protect them; it gives them a legal remedy to deal with people they have allowed to occupy therir properties.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The problem is that anyone could claim they are not a squatter but were given permission to stay there.  The only fair way is to let a judge decide.  Otherwise, a landlord could evict anyone by declaring them a squatter.|`|AA10123414	It does. It take a very long time for squatters to acquire any rights|`|eulMjLtPaa	In the US, squatting laws vary from state to state and city to city.  Usually they are evicted (i.e. kicked off) through loitering or trespass laws.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	There is a new law against squatters, but unless the owner knows that someone is squatting in an empty property of his, then they can go on staying there.|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	Because we have idiot law makers.|`|AA11540917	it's not that simple    If the landlord paid any attention to his building then the squatters never would never have been able to get any rights.|`|X81oLqMtaa	That is ridiculous.    The easiest way to get rid of squatters is to threaten them with a gun and tell them that you will make them 'disappear' if they don't leave immediately.
gW0nD5cEaa	If they are sequestered, they might not be allowed to watch any TV, maybe movie videos or something like that. If they are not sequestered (or confined during the time of trial), but in a change of venue, they might be allowed some TV but not the news. Maybe not "Law & Order" either since they always come from real cases, I don't know. I don't know about internet access, either. And if they were sequestered, either no phone calls or closely monitored ones.     The times I've been on jury duty I was not sequestered and we were instructed not to watch or listen to (this was basically before the internet or I did not have access) any news about the case. But the cases I've been on were not ones you heard about.     The best known sequestered jury in history was the OJ Simpson murder trial which went on, I think for 8 or 9 months.
EWQncHVlaa	No I did not regret serving in the Royal Navy I came from a military family my father served in the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) but in 1968 they disbanded them so I decided to join the navy. Another reason was my Grandfather on my mother's side served in the Royal Flying Corps in the first world war, so I can say three generations have served in all the branches of the military, ( Army, Navy and Air Force ) I got paid to visit countries that even today are too expensive to visit like Australia, New Zealand, Malta just to name a few the only reason that I left the navy was I was onboard HMS Reward (A264) then I was to join HMS Fittleton  but they both sunk by accident six weeks apart and I took a breakdown.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Nope, it was horrible at the time but it launched my life into a more prosperous era. I grew up in a trailor with no running water and had no chance for a future. Since I joined the Navy, now I'm in college working for an aviation contractor company and looking at getting a BS in about a year, payed for. It was a great decision but it was one of the most horrible times of my life. It's like a jail sentence that once you're done with and released you're proud of. That's exactly what it's like.|`|aJBAobQyaa	Hell no...I was 17, just out of high school, parents were working class, couldn't go to college, didn't want to go to college, joined the Navy, got to see the world, go around the globe (4 times), 183 countries on 5 continents, made absolutely tons of friends..got to shoot at bad guys, and got a B.S. degree to boot.  Met a wonderful lady, got married, had kids, lived happily ever after.  Only regret is that I retired after 31 years.  I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat, and not change a thing.

Those strict requirements are a product of the first amendment guarantee of the right of free speech.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Slander is a very difficult charge to prove..

The problem is you'd have to prove (1) That what she's saying is completely false, (2) That she knows it's completely false, and (3) That she's making these statements maliciously.  The cases where someone has successfully sued for slander are very few and far between because it is so difficult to prove all three elements.    P.S.:  The Army JAG Corps will not support any type of administrative or disciplinary action against you unless the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that you actually committed the offense(s) alleged against you.  If the state office isn't willing to take action against you despite her reporting you six times, the JAG Corps will see through that and will recommend that your CO do nothing unless the crazy bee-otch can come up with some actual proof.
pnpkJKvpaa	This would be illegal, but difficult and expensive to enforce.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	They are selling their skills, not the image. You pick out the image, you have it stuck on you for life. The companies should pay you for advertising.|`|VjgqZetcaa	Yes, it is illegal to charge money for making an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted character, and it is a federal crime.  If they don't pay royalties, or have some other agreement with the copyright owner, then all copies they make are illegal as "derivative works" owned by the original artists.  Anyone who purchases such an infringement could also (in theory) be ordered to have it obliterated from their skin or pay damages (royalties) for the privilege of displaying the stolen artwork in public.  If the tat is hidden, that may change the calculations.

There are fewer Americans in Iraq that policemen in California, yet the two are nearly identical in size and populations.  Compare that to Gaza, where it is completely surrounded by Israel.

Ot7PJrddaa	As a deterrent - China has the worlds largest army and one deterrent to them invading is the assurance that they would be destroyed by us before they could invade.  Russia still maintains a large amount of nuclear weapons as well and require us to maintain ours as a deterrent as well.  A necessary evil I would say.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It is called mutually assured destruction, meaning that if someone attacks us we can destroy them.

No nation should have nuclear weapons. As a Canadian, here are my reasons why. Canada used to have nuclear weapons too. Canada has the resources, technology, and money to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons to dwarf the United States and Russia. But decades ago, Canada decided to put a stop to having nuclear weapons. I can think of few other nations that would be "more responsible" than Canada. So that argument goes out the window. Because even though you may CURRENTLY have a responsible government, who is to say that the nuclear weapons could not be used by a government with alterior motives? Or stolen by a terrorist group hellbent on destruction?     They are useless. In a conventional war, they would mostly kill civilians. In fact, that's its very purpose. There is no point to having them. The only protection it offers is that it scares the living hell out of  any country who wishes to attack your own. There's always the threat that they may be destroyed. But if they have nuclear weapons too, that same risk is posed to your own nation.     Not to mention the fallout from the weapons. When Chernobyl exploded in the Ukraine, fallout extended as far as Canada. Obviously not in high concentrations, but in noticeable concentrations. This is why we should not have nuclear weapons. Maybe one or two to use as a deterrent - but we certainly don't need 13,000 - enough to blow the Earth to pieces several times over. It's asinine.    Through simple diplomacy and not pissing off and exploiting other countries, we can deter them from attacking us.    Edit: To add, Canada technically does not have nuclear weapons. But we do have weapons unassembled and can get more very quickly. So while we don't have any, we can put them together fast.|`|T4zxS0hIaa	dr. demento..... your a joke... ahahahahahhh aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhahahahahaha
rKY8Cjmxaa	The government should NOT have gotten involved, and they should not be spending my money, your money or any American's money on this project. Buying people converter boxes is simply wrong. Whenever the government spends money frivolously, it's wrong.    The American People own the air waves and the FCC regulates their usage. The FCC has licensed use of our air waves to various entities, some of which are television broadcasters, but we retain ownership.    Providing coupons for converters should have been a decision for the holders of licenses, particularly the broadcasters. If they want us to see their ads, they might want to subsidize our converters. It really should have been up to them, and their money!    EDIT  Just read everyone else's posts. The government did not instigate digital television. A consortium of broadcasters did. Due to pressure from broadcasters, the FCC set up a committee of exploration in 1982 (ATSC) then another (Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service) in 1987 to consider improving our television system. This one rests squarely on the shoulders of the broadcast industry, so if anyone should bear the burden, it should be them.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Hey, I'm not low income but I'm getting a coupon for the converter box.      As another user has said:    The creation and maintenance of the air waves was in part paid for by taxpayers.  Those frequencies are now only used by a minority of taxpayers and so it makes sense to reallocate them for better purposes. Nonetheless those few who were using them did pay taxes. And deserve to be offered another option.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	It's not just to low income people.    Anyone can get a coupon.      But, it's the gov't decision to go digital and therefore, should incur some of the cost of doing so.|`|wtcAK31Paa	Its not just for low income people. ANYONE can request a coupon for the converter boxes.     Stop finding something to complain about.|`|AA10329269	Television is not a right. But once the government decided it should control the airwaves, they now have to foot the bill when they choose to manipulate them. It's total BS. But if they would have kept their fingers out of television to begin with, then we wouldn't even be talking about this....    Anyone who doesn't believe the Federal government has gotten too big is completely insane.|`|AA10123414	"Is television a right to American citizens?" - Nope.    "is providing coupons for digital converter boxes to low income folks" - Half truth. They are providing coupons to anyone that needs them. Bill Gates could have a coupon if he wanted one.    Government regulation is changing the standard under which TV operates.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Since when is it governments job to subsidize entertainment?!      Demoacrap Sam Adams like teenage boys, should we subsidize that arrangement?!!|`|xagiOb80aa	The coupons are available to EVERYONE (2 per household).    Further, the airwaves are public domain, and we, provide the use of them to broadcasters.    This is about $$$, with digital TV, cell phone companies and wireless providers will be able to use some of the bandwidth formerly associated with analogue TV|`|ZXkOQapLaa	They aren't just for low income. Yes people who have older televisions shouldn't be in a lurch because the government decided to change the transmission ways. Maybe you don't mind throwing out a television but I do.|`|mdHqr17kaa	LOL    it is a liability.      you are not paying for the mass "entertainment" of your fellow citizens through the powers of the air.    the "right" to television is policy now.  better to discern and defend works of quality by Sam Izdat.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Anybody can get coupons from the government and most with analog TVS did, regardless of income level. That is why there are so many who have not gotten them. If an income level requirement was involved there would still be some left, although if that were the case they would have issued fewer to begin with.     TV is not just entertainment, no it's not a 'right' exactly, but people need something for weather reports, news, and other important information. Yes, knowing what Britney Spears or Angelina Jolie is doing is not vital. But knowing the news, the real news is an important link with people, sometimes home bound due to illness or other reasons have with the world.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	No. The government has no business making these choices for us. They have no right to furnish anyone with a converter box or a TV.  Just another step to gain control over our lives, and no one is noticing. Little by little we are being duped. Light bulbs, TV's, Smoking...our freedom of choice is eroding.|`|03B5ebLOaa	The majority of these people who are using the coupons are Senior citizens and nursing homes. Who else would have TVs that are so old, they would still have rabbit ears on them. They can not afford to buy a digital converter box on their restricted income... so the government is offering the coupons and it is only one or two per household. So I do not have a problem with it.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	It seems it's become another entitlement.  Like Social Security, it's not just for the poor, it's for everybody.  There's no income criteria for those coupons.  Anyone with the price of a stamp can write in for one.  Fortunately, most of us won't need one because we've had cable/satellite TV for years.  I was a late comer to cable, and I haven't watched broadcast TV since the early 90's.|`|9RXS67Mmaa	What do you propose? Should the folks who cannot get, or afford satellite or cable be forced to either buy the converter box, or do without? Some folks have no other way of connecting to the outside world, are we going to shut them down?    The FCC has imposed this change, so why is it they should not help implement the change?|`|xIowgWL7aa	For many people, television is their one link to the world. Most of the people who still use rabbit ears are elderly and new fangled things like cable don't appeal to them. Take away their televisions and they become more isolated.     I think the actual number of people who have to make the switch is rather small compared to those of us who fork out a fortune in our own money to pay for cable.|`|AA11450062	Because we the people own the airwaves, it is part of the commons. Just like in Venezuela the oil is part of the commons because the oil is under their feet.|`|pHmKGLMoaa	No.  I agree it is a crock to give these coupons.  If it was a right, why don't they give us TVs?  The government is spending so much money educating people of the conversion and it's stupid.  If people don't know by now, they need to start reading instead of watching TV.|`|2b7VqUXXaa	If you want TV, BUY a converter
mr8isJoZaa	Basically, with the introduction of the post 9/11 GI bill, you will have to choose which one you want to use.  It is one or the other, so you have to sit down, look at the cost of the schools you want to go to and determine which one is more beneficial.  I had to sit through many classes on the new GI bill.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Welcome to the GI Bill Website
7KBCQn6Baa	Hey Sam. I hope I can help you with some information that may be useful to you. I always enjoy helping new recruits.  That's great that you work out already. That will take a lot of cross hairs and fire off your fanny when you're in Basic Training. Just don't forget, push ups and sit ups are just as important in the ARMY. Be sure to take a PT Test with your recruiter and score high and you will go in as an E2 instead of an E1. This means of course, higher pay for you. Learn your phonetic alphabet as mentioned before by another poster. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Hotel, etc. etc. You can find all that online. Facing movements (your recruiter will square you away with this if you ask), rank structure, and military courtesies which will give you a jump start on your buddies.  Try to get an Airborne packet put in when you enlist with your recruiter. It will help you out in the long run and it's an extension of training once you've completed basic. It's not too difficult, and the school is worth promotion points.  Research what other options are available to you when you enlist. Work out a sweet sign on bonus. I have known some disappointed soldiers who found out there buddy received $36,000 to enlist while they got shafted with nothing.  Also inquire about the Army College Fund. They may not mention it to you, but it's available on top of the awesome new Montgomery GI Bill for education. It's worth it.  Some tips while you're in basic...  Lay low and blend in. Don't talk too much. Stay out of sick call (look our for those cross hairs). Stay positive knowing that each day is a day nearer to completing the BS.  Hope this helps some.|`|4edAKtBGaa	I joined yesterday as a 31B, Military Police, shipping out May 20th! hooah  Oh and run a lot, do a lot of push ups and sit ups and you should be fine.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	When you are running think about this:  When you get tried while running what are you going to do.  A. Stop and rest.  B. Say "To hell with this and walk home.  C. Push your self and keep running.  The military isn't all about physical conditioning. You have to use your head as well.    Everything you ever wanted to know about Basic Training.|`|ZYcwuNkQaa	Isn't "hooah" the Marines slogan?|`|Ot5maIapaa	Be careful. The Army isnt exactly the safest job on the planet :P|`|CW7Sej2uaa	Get ready for the mind games.  Just get it into your head that you are there until you are done and it does not matter what you do during that time.|`|nWOIVPn9aa	push ups.... sit ups..... pull ups.... run run run..... and you should be fine! GOOD LUCK!|`|T4zxS0hIaa	well you are doing the right thing for the work out... but learn ranks marches and anything that is army related time, alphabet, ect.. this will all help you when you go to basic!!! trust me i know!|`|3ba92f492227f1c19665470daace0744aa	Lots of pushup, situps and chinups...
d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Depends on how smart our world leaders are. If they just choose to ignore that starting a nuclear war would cause major destruction to the world then so help us.

t3QAaSN9aa	Conservative politicians don't want to hear about the plight of the people who don't have jobs, even though many of their constituents are in that situation. They are opposed to any approaches to the economic problems that might actually be successful for the Democrats.  Most economists are saying that the stimulus is needed right now in order to help the economy. Conservatives operate on the basis of ideology and they are obviously very selective about which economic theories they pay any attention to, so taking an economics class won't help them.    Edit:  Note the ridiculous arguments they are using about tax cuts and businesses hiring people.  Businesses sell goods and services.  If people don't have money to buy those goods and services, why would a business hire any more people to provide good and services that nobody is buying. Where is the logic in that.|`|BJhOd2usaa	Apparently not. It's beyond belief. We know from experience -- the Bush tax cuts and refund -- that people will bank one time tax cut money rather than spending it. Which means it won't work as a stimulus. And reduced government spending will slow the economy, not stimulate it. That's Econ 101.|`|lr74sHPLaa	majored in it    Economically speaking it goes against the basic principles of economics, it would only be a temporary fix/stimulant with temporary jobs, temporary cash flow, and when that is all said and done there will be no bottom under it all to catch it.    Tax cuts lead the business/corporations to having more jobs available and not having the need to downsize/streamline in bad times like these, the more money they get in tax benefits, the more money they have to offer employee/prospective employees.    The tax cuts will just need to be overwatched to make sure its not being funneled into bonuses and CEO benefits/stock shares, but when done right tax cuts slowly but surely get the ball (aka the economy) rolling.    CLASS DISMISSED. lol|`|AA10206116	Cutting taxes of business will give those employers more money to hire help. You must have flunked out of school.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Having presided over an economic crisis not seen since Hoover, the Republicans' squabbles with pork and excessive spending in the economic stimulus plan will be perceived as ranging from blindingly disingenuous to outright hypocritical. When the public lost the benefit of a government it could trust, the Republican party lost the benefit of the doubt. Now, injured and wayward, the Republican leadership has geared up for a fight it cannot win, against a president who, both in mandate and in institutional advantage, enjoys unmatched power. That they cannot see the strategic error they are engaging in, that they are unable to regroup and reformulate, self-assess and readjust, is perhaps the answer to the most dumb-founding of questions. How could the Republicans, who only four years ago spoke of a permanent majority, have allowed themselves to become almost entirely irrelevant? They have only one playbook, and it doesn't apply.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Yes, but more importantly, instead of the theory, we studied the history. Empirical economic history doesn't really support blindly spending money without any meaningful direction, as this Porkapalooza bill is doing.    All the proposed spending in the bill won't help those who aren't working either, but it adds to the national debt and decreases future economic growth.    Keynes might be great in the classrom, like communism, but it doesn't do so well in real life.|`|OlCr3iNFaa	Right on!!!  We should all subscribe to the liberal economic plan.   Free money for everybody!!!!!  We will spend our way out of debt!   It's the governments job to feed us isn't it?   They have lots of money and if they need more they can just stick it to the rich guys!|`|xkcLOfTKaa	If business owners pay less taxes, they are more likely to have the capital to hire more people.    If people have more in their paycheck, they can spend more which created more demand, which creates more jobs...    It is pretty simple. Economics 101 (supply and demand)    EDIT : OK ! You can't more simple than this.  Our economy is based on the money that we spend. If we pay less taxes, we have more money to spend. Is that simple enough for you?|`|qUSkOO03aa	Oh you must have read the liberal talking points.   Well I'll tell you what tax cuts will do.  First it will take some of the pressure off  of small businesses, and what is the goal of a small business...............to grow and expand.  So to do that they hire more people and in  turn sell more product and so forth. Now can you tell me what spending money on ACORN and rubbers is going to do for the economy|`|AA11288277	I have a PhD. in economics.  Now I know this will be difficult for you to comprehend, but try to follow along.  If taxes and government regulations are reduced the climate becomes more favorable businesses to grow and expand.  When business grows and expands then they have to hire more people.  More people working and paying taxes, means more government revenue.  When government increases taxes and regulations the climate becomes less favorable for businesses to make a profit.  Without profits businesses cut back on growth therefore jobs are lost.  When people are out of work, they do not pay taxes and either collect unemployment or welfare (both paid by the government).|`|fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	Their argument of course is that those whom get big tax cuts (wealthy and corporations) will use the cut to create more jobs. However, this "trickle down" theory of economics has been a total failure since its inception. A failure for America that is, but a huge success for the greedy whom are using this "trust capitalism to be honest" strategy to consolidate wealth into as few hands as possible.|`|0j9Ggisxaa	I see so everyone working for the government is the answer..Riiight!!!    Where pray tell does the money come from to pay for even bigger government???|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	Yes we have and when the government can take 1 tax dollar and get only 10 cents to the person you needs the help it doesn't take rocket science to think it is a bad thing that the government knows how to solve any problem.    The same people who pay $500 bucks for hammer are the ones who can save my job?    I don't think so.    The government is not the solution but it is the problem.    The words that should strike fear in Americans are:  We are here from the government and we are here to help.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	"What good are tax cuts for those who aren't working?"    a. Tax cuts for businesses are more likely to lead to a job being opened for an unemployed person than a tax increase.    b. Tax cuts for individuals would benefit someone who was employed half the year, but now finds themselves out of a job AND having to pay taxes.      c. Tax cuts for individuals make it easier for an unemployed person to try out self-employment    d. Tax cuts for everyone lead to more money being spent in the economy, which helps stimulate it.    I think you give too much credit for "loopholes".  Most business people, especially small business people, would disagree with your assessment that they avoid paying high taxes.|`|oNEi61iLaa	Relief, Reform, Recovery. Tax cuts = relief. They can also help stimulate economic activity (recovery)    It's time for everyone to wake up and realize that we have a MIXED ECONOMY just like every other industrialized country. Neither laissez faire or socialism is desirable. Economics should not lead to ideological arguments, because our economic problems can only be solved by bipartisanship and borrowing solutions from both right and left. The president understands this, why doesn't Congress (both Democrats and Republicans)|`|kFmgWf3Paa	Another liberal clown that thinks corporations are "evil".|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Most on this board never took a basic English course either.    Or a history course I may add.    It's funny they tout their educations, but only liberal professors teach college.      And they have nerve to say Liberals don't understand logic.  Liberals don't understand Conservative logic at all.    Neither do I.    Edit:   Funny how they all went to economics 101, but never graduated to economics 201.   Cutting out all taxes for small business won't help them one bit if nobody is buying their product or service.|`|5lflypTiaa	As a rule Republicans will generally benefit from a tax cut and that's all they care about. It's too obvious that proposing tax cuts will help nothing, that's why nobody pays any attention to them any more, that's why Conservatives have become irrelevant.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Buying American made goods will help the economy. Tax breaks help but certainly are not a solution. Government spending is also not a solution. As long as the country is in mass debt you will not have responsible government spending.|`|yJE7INkUaa	ik, the only way our economy will get better is if people start spending money  people are too afraid to spend their money right now, which is making the economy worse because nobody is buying anything.   Tax cuts wont do anything, just because people are getting slightly more money, it not like there going to go and spend it all, its just more money to save

He has no track record of personal sleaze.    Yes, I want rid of Brownie-baby, but not at the cost of getting Mandy in exchange.|`|6WyFaKRAaa	Peter Mandelson IS prime minister. He's the puppeteer that pulls Brown's strings and puts the words into his mouth. What is happening is that all politicians are in the hands of the New World Order who are planning to rule the world.

They always have been popularity contests.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Man, you just don't get it, do you?    He would have gotten 60% of the popular vote, easy.|`|JUyid5Wgaa	He would not have been considered to begin with.|`|7zf05NWsaa	No he would not have been.    Black voters turned out in full force to vote for him because he's black.  That few million he needed would have never happened had he been white.  If they would have turned out like they did in the past, Mcain would have won. Thats a fact.|`|AA11828439	Yes. Since when has being Black been an advantage in America?|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	yes, he would have!! anyone who thinks otherwise is just hatin' on his victory!!|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	We didn't vote for him because of the color of his skin. we voted for him because we believe in his policies.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Not a chance.    He would not have been elected to a predominately  Black District in Chicago as a state legislator.    He would then have never been elected to the Senate with the overwhelming support of the Black voters of Chicago.    He would never had been asked to give the key note speech at the '04 DNC Convention. He was the newest (and only) Black Senator and needed to be shown off.    He would not have enjoyed a 93% support among Black voters during the Primaries and would not have been able to beat Hillary    His race has played an important if not critical role in his success. Couple that with his ability to read a teleprompter and being a new comer to the scene (unlike Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson), his skeletons have not been sufficiently aired.    To believe Obama would still be President if he were White is ridiculous.    **All these Libs who think he would still be Pres simply because they didn't want another Rep in the White House have extremely short memories. There were the Primaries first and foremost. Obama would never have come out on top without the almost unanimous support of the Black vote (not to mention the record turnout of the Black vote). If the Black vote had followed every statistical average set before, Obama would not have gotten more than 60%. That would not have been enough to beat Hillary. Hillary had more experience, was a good speaker, and had virtually the identical stands on the key issues. The ONLY reason Obama pulled in such a huge percentage of Black voter and in such huge numbers was not because he was born in Hawaii.|`|4TqERLSgaa	Yes, because he cheated.|`|CiDVOEwraa	aboslutely not. Any white guy with his affiliations and weak resume would have been laughed out of the primaries early on...|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	Not a chance.  With his leftest voting record,. he would have been DOA|`|K6KeN7sgaa	Sure.  But would W. have been president if his daddy wasn't rich?|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Yes.|`|HZy629kLaa	When weren't they popularity contests?    As for the rest, how many other black presidents have their been. There is your answer.|`|YTgw2VQjaa	I think so.  He is a charismatic person, well spoken, and intelligent.  I still would vote for him if he was white... especially against Palin, what a joke!|`|AA10168935	He was elected in spite of the fact he was black, not because of it.|`|AA11450062	Yes, he had the largest grass roots movement in history thanks to the youth. And let us not forget that more white people voted for him then black people.|`|WlO4wKNDaa	he would've  won  American Idol. it's all Oprahs fault she convinced the white women vote.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Yep.  Being black has never been an advantage.  That's why he's the first.|`|PcW8H1Asaa	CNN  had a 90+ man who said " I voted for him cause he was black"    Course, the best reason I heard was the one from the college women in Kansas.  Voted for him because "they thought that he would get them better internet service."    No joke !!!  we are soooooooo screwed !!!|`|Fy54FMemaa	If the cast of rent was running as a democrate they would have won also... any republican who was close to Bush really had no chance.    I support Obama, I hope and pray that he holds true to his word. I am keeping an open mind. Things that McCain did during his election did not sit right with me, having Palin come in at the end was the icing.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Not a chance.  He won the election for one reason:  he was black.  This galvanized the black voters to come out and vote for him, and they did.  Sure, some white people voted for him - so did some Chinese, Vietnamese, Hispanics, etc - but had he NOT been black, he would NOT have capture 97% of the black vote.    If he didn't have his color to run on, his record surely wouldn't have done him any favors.  Then again, as has been said, after the Bush presidency I think Bucky the Dancing Mule could have gotten elected.    Saw this on a bumper sticker and thought that it was right on target:    "VOTING FOR SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK IS JUST AS RACIST AS VOTING AGAINST SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK."    So now all of you Obamabots out there, all of you mindless lemmings who see Obama as some kind of great savior, y'all go right ahead and give me a great big ol' thumbs down for voicing my opinion.    And two years from now, when Obama has proven himself to be the BAD choice, y'all remember this.|`|JCdBSULraa	Nope.  Let's look at the facts:    He was strongly connected to racists (Rev. Jeremiah Wright).  His campaign kicked off at the home of his friends who were terrorists (William Heirs).  He was one of the top beneficiaries of the policies which caused Freddie and Fannie may to crumble and sent the nation into recession (arguably depression).  He won his senate seat by running unopposed (he got his opposition disqualified, but he probably deserved it, so that might not count against him)  He has almost no political experience at all.  Hillary was still a woman and would have secured the DNC by playing the gender card.  Of course there are a hundred other things, but any one of those things would have disqualified a non-black automatically|`|ciAAdMd2aa	Yes... afterall, he was running against a Republican.  See the congressional races please.  Last year was not the Republicans time to win.  This was not about black or white... this was about a crippled GOP.|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	He didn't win because he's black.  Some people here are saying he won because blacks came out in big numbers. Blacks make up a small percentage of the total population, hence why they're called a minority.  Obama won because a lot of whites voted for him. Iowa, for example, isn't exactly full of black people.  Too many people cling to their knee-jerk mentalities, saying, oh, black people voted for him just because he's black. Funny that these same people, often white, never complained about white people voting for white candidates because they were white.  All of a sudden, whites are complaining about a perceived prejudice or "racism." They didn't have a problem when they were the beneficiaries of racism for many decades.  Obama won for numerous strategic reasons.   First, he appealed to white and young voters, more so young voters. He used the Internet to his advantage.   Second, Clinton underestimated him, thinking the Democratic nomination was hers, all hers, and the rest was just signing the dotted line.  Third, people knew the Republicans got the country in this mess, so they weren't about to vote Republican.  Fourth, he won despite being black. There were still millions of people who didn't want to vote for him because he was black. They'd rather vote for McCain-Palin.  Fifth, people saw through the Palin choice as a weak attempt to get the female vote.  Sixth, people knew McCain to be another version of Bush.  Seventh, people just wanted someone different, and Obama showed himself to be the more composed individual.  And as for your comment that elections are now popularity contests, well, they've always been that.  Do you not study history?  Do you think JFK won simply because of his stances?  Or even Reagan.  Or just about any person who ran for office.  That comment of yours is soaked in naivete and a lack of awareness. Start reading, start studying history, and analyzing and thinking, and not just accepting what others tell you.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Nope, you have to imagine how many people came out of the woodwork just to vote for him because he WAS black without even taking a moment to consider anything he was saying about politics. I saw an episode of MTV Cribs where they asked an african american man with gold teeth and baggy trousers why he voted for Obama., he replied with, "Shiiat dog, Cause Obama Da Shiz." Sounds like Obama's politics won this lucky young voter over eh?|`|HY1bH1Phaa	NO|`|UY6mkCk2aa	I heard on the news on election day that only 2-5% of people voted on him because of his race|`|yXaob7wNaa	yes, actually he would of won even if he wasn't African American because America was sick of a Republican president such as Bush being that he didn't do anything for this country. if you watched the news on election night you would see that he won in most states that are a majority of whites.We needed a Democratic president to help us through these economic crisis that we are in right now, because it would have been the rich would get richer and the poor would get poorer. It has nothing to do with color but it is a change because the last 43 presidents were Caucasian males, And President Obama is half white and half black. I have all my hope in him and I hope in 2012 Hilary runs because we need a woman president. I voted for him because of what he stood by and his morals not because he was black and plus i couldn't stand McCain or that darn Palin.He is the president, LIVE WITH IT!! Yes i did go to the Inauguration and It was a moment in history.
3oz4r6Nraa	There's not much to it, it's just a regular church ceremony with Obama in attendance.      Here is the website for the church he attended, St. John's Church in Lafayette Square: http://www.stjohns-dc.org/  They have pictures of the service and information up there that should help you.  (Scroll down and you will see the link to "President Obama's Inauguration Service Photos."  You can check out the website to see what their services involve.)    This is for the day after, but maybe it will help you too.  It's the Inaugural Prayer Service at the National Cathedral: http://www.nationalcathedral.org/|`|PcW8H1Asaa	he gets up   showers  get dressed   has breakfast.    now with Bam Bam  he might read the quran.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	I believe it entails a preacher jumping up and down, gyrating, and screaming about how he has the power to damn people and whole countries, or something like that.|`|winmjHAmaa	I'm not real sure, I've never heard this.  But I'm sure they were chanting Obama as they always seem to do.  My friend went to see the inaguration and she said people were singing church songs and replacing "God" with "Obama."

The service probably includes a prayer for the incoming President as well.
XdGjhbfMaa	I don't believe that one state can suspend a another state's license.  However, the no insurance ticket is something that will follow the driver everywhere, and because insurance is required by law in all fifty states, the state in which car is registered will cancel that vehicle's registration upon learning of the accident.  The driver will also have to deal with any criminal charges pressed by the state of California as well as any civil lawsuits if they were deemed at fault for the accident.  In order to get the car's registration reinstated the owner will have to provide proof of insurance which will now yield an incredibly high premium because that what happens when one is caught driving without insurance.  If driving without insurance is suspendable in the state in which the driver is from, there is a good chance that that state will assess points against the license and suspend it.|`|g2yUDLygaa	No, California cannot suspend your license based on driving without insurance.  However, they can prohibit you from driving in the State of California without insurance.  They can also send the information regarding the accident to the DMV or Secretary of State of your home state, and they may suspend your license based on the offense of driving without insurance.

mxXwQRfxaa	It is honorable that you are considering military service.  I do understand the tough economic times.  I have been in the military for almost 8 years, and it has certainly secured my family financially.      I think you realize this, but I will go ahead and say it anyway to make sure.  Understand that no matter what part of the military you join, you are making a commitment to service.  This service includes the very real possibility that you might go to war, and you might never come home.  Unless you and your family can accept this and are willing to proudly accept the risk and sacrafice, then for your sake and theirs, don't enlist.  God Bless.|`|AA11481224	you will do a regular job     theres no sports program in the military    you join you deploy even the band    my husband was in the navy band and also a nuke  he deployed    dont join you arent military material|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	There is no military soccer program.    The military does have the " elite athletics program "    But that is for individual competetions.    But they deploy just as often as everyone else does.    They have a regualr job they have to do everyday,     They train in thier off duty times.    They are just based on Post with the facilities and coachs to help them train, and are given time off to go to competetions.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	what branch has athletics???|`|AA10709853	doesn't work that way.   you cannot enlist to play a sport full time.   you enlist for a job and MIGHT be allowed to try out for the All( Your Branch Here) (Your team here) Team.      but highly doubtful you will get the chance at all.|`|99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	The truly "world class athletes" in the services do train and work at their sport full time but they are still soldiers, sailors etc and can be deployed.

None of them would attempt to shirk their duty in my experience.|`|3SwJy3B7aa	You wont deploy but you will train all the time and make sure you get it in your contract to try out.|`|BImIMnbzaa	There are no guarantees that as an athlete you will avoid deployment.  Your dad's gig worked for the time, and still today musicians who make it to the elite levels, such as the Marine Band, often don't get transferred to FMF unless they really screw up.    If you joined today, you will have close to six months of training before deployment is a possibility.  Athletics could delay it, and if you're really lucky, prevent it !  Talk to a recruiter.|`|GJ3tNgWNaa	What you have to remember are the word "if you qualify".  My Dad told me a similar story to your father's.  He was in the Navy boot camp with a sailor who said that he was going to join the Navy band.  During basic, the sailor tripped and broke a couple of teeth which left him unable to play his trumpet.  He was re-classed and became a corp man (Navy medic) and sent to Vietnam with a Marine Platoon.  Has a recruiter actually talked to you?  Read the following article that I have linked for you.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	Athletics in the military are secondary, and not a duty(not an MOS, AFSC, etc..).  So if you enlist, you are deployable.    Every Soldier is a rifleman; every Marine is a Rifleman; every Airman can be a Security Force augmentee; every Sailor defends the base, ship, sub, etc...

Use it for the class.  If the store wants it, get permission from the creators of the game.  They may give it to you at no cost or they may charge.  Either way you will be safe from a law suit.
GMYNuFCDaa	The Republican Party formed exactly for the reason of opposing slavery. Abraham Lincoln was the first president elected in the Republican party.    They called it, the Republican party then too.    Democrats have some spin that Lincoln really didn't want to free the slaves, which contradicts history. Then they also contradict themselves by saying that the rolls of the parties have since switched, which is absolutely false.    Martin Luther King was a republican, and the black community didn't start it's decline (Higher than par levels of single motherhood and crime rates) until after the so called black leaders did their deal with the devil, aka the democrat party.     Now the democrat black leaders make millions keeping their people feeling like whites keep them down, keeping them separated and voting for democrats ... talking about keeping it real, which actually keeps them in excuses and feeling like they can't get out of their situation until it's become a multi generational plague which will be hard to turn around.     The democrats, as they had been (the party of pro slavery, then pro segregation, now pro programs that keep black people from coming up out of their rut) are the party that does everything they can to hold the black community down, because then they profited from the free labor / now they profit from the entrapped huge solid voting block the black community provides, while they are kept down.    Slavery on the TICKET?  What was on the TICKET? Resistance to slavery was the ONLY reason the Republican party was born. Now that has to be denied because some don't like the Republican party cause all their buddies are democrats? That's a pretty smart way to re-write history lol.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	None.

However, I was a gov major in college and over and over again I heard that the Republican party was formed in efforts to end the institution of slavery.|`|pGG4RUddaa	The republican party was Lincoln's original party..In the 60's there was a huge shift toward the democratic party because of the war.|`|hdcLCk8Faa	No party began over slavery. Lincoln said he would allow slavery if that would keep the Nation United. He also said he would abolish slavery if that kept it together as well. Finally Lincoln said if he had to allow slavery in some states and not others to keep the nation together , he would do it.    So much for the great emancipator. He did to unite the Nation, not some moral sense of freeing the slaves.|`|t5hp4t79aa	There were no political parties that had the isssue of slavery on the ticket. Most if not all of the founding fathers were evil, murdering, kidnapping, rapists who used slavery to their advantage, "to basically sit on their asssses and get fat while others did their work for them." Closer to the civil war their were more abolishonists in the Republican party than the Democrat Party. After the War the Reps wanted to reconstruct the south along more egalitarian lines while teh dems preffered a return to servitude for the ex slaves...Blacks who could vote during and just after slavery voted Republican, and did so untill the 1930s. The modern parties began in the 1920-30's When FDR took office. He created a new sense of social commitment in the Dem party. The Reps became recognizable with Nixon who played on the fears of the common man, especially in the South. Barry Goldwater ran for President as a Republican not long after Nixon's loss to Kennidy. Goldwater's segregationalist sentiments got the Southern vote and changed the demographics of the two parties forever...

Please be aware of your OPSEC and watch the info you give out.|`|3NP7pns9aa	When I was in Kuwait (fairly recently), we had internet stations that were free, but you had a 30 minute time limit. He will have the option to purchase prepaid wireless minutes for his laptop, but we never really experienced any success with that while we were there. You can purchase cellphones, but they are ridiculously expensive and usually not worth it. There are phone centers in Kuwait too. The AT&T centers require prepaid phone cards to use, but there are also other phones that you can set up an account on and its substantially cheaper than regular phonecards. Sometimes, if you are lucky and wait in a long enough line, you can use free phones as well, but those usually have a 15 minute limit.    I have not been to his location, so I could not tell you what exactly he will have there, but in all likelihood, he will be able to buy internet, or atleast use an internet cafe at the MWR facility.     I would suggest getting internet and then using a service like Skype instead of buying a cellphone. Then you can make calls through your computer for a fairly cheap rate. Its quite popular where I am :)

They break you down, and rebuild you stronger.  It doesn't matter if you're shy, fat, skinny, and so-on.  Once you enlist, they'll see to it that they make you an Airmen, Sailor, Soldier or Marine.

esOaJoqBaa	It should not be a problem as long as you renounce your citizenship. Just to join I don't think having dual citizenship is a problem in the US, but it is probably illegal in the other country. You will still have to complete all the training because they won't accept your past training.  As far as security clearance goes, it probably depends on the country you came from. Having ties with certain countries can be a problem if trying to get a TS clearance.

AARZV2v0aa	not if you cut it before you go which i HIGHLY recommend!  Cause when they cut it they chop it off and they dont care what you look like. But it cant touch your collar. But cut it shorter than that because you get three haircuts while your there, and if you can get past the first two then the third they spend a litlle more time cause its right before you graduate. Oh and another tip bring few items when you first get there, an address book, PHONE CARD, chapstick that you like NOT lip gloss, and the clothes off you back they will send everything home except the address book, wallet sized pics, and chapstick. Um you should also wax your armpits (if you can) and eyebrows, because you cant touch your eyebrows at all they get mad, and you can only shave on sun. Just try to do what your told, dont freak out it goes by fast, and just PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!!!!! thats about all i can tell you! Good luck! have fun, when you can. Its what you make of it.|`|eDPI5jYvaa	Yes they will. You should cut your hair and sell it at: http://hairbuyer.com before you ship out.|`|2oUhQQ5Raa	They will cut it to a regulation haircut.

Think of your daughter and file.    The Army won't keep him in for his debt (unless he owes the Army)|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	I don't know if the Army will hold him up from full-time if he owes or not, but if you wait and he doesn't pay, you have a better chance of getting your money.    All you have to do is contact his command section and his finance department will be taking the chunk out of his paycheck to pay this debt.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	Sometimes, if he's going into active duty, they will have him fill out a financial statement.  The military doesn't like to see outstanding debts because it's a headache for them if it gets out of hand.  Also, if he's needing a security clearance for his job, they will check for debts as well.  If it shows he has outstanding debt, it can affect whether he gets the clearance or not.  Maybe he could just pay you directly the first month or so and then you could turn in the paperwork after he gets in and is all settled.

These include a long-needed overhaul of Social Security and starting over on the Federal Tax Code.    He did receive Congressional support on several key issues, and it is well to remember that the president spends not one dime without Congress giving it to him.|`|q6ka1qEtaa	oh you watched that fox news video on u tube.  and you bought it....lol|`|iMaRt7Eraa	How dare you challenge the media|`|IDZTtipeaa	Congress is comprised of the House of Representatives and Senate.  From 2001-2003 the Senate had an even split between the parties.  The Republicans had a nine person majority in the House.  That would mean a majority Republican Congress.    Edit:  Your additional information does not change the clear, plain and simple fact that Congress (which, again, includes the House and Senate) was a majority Republican.  Perhaps you should change your question to specify the Senate and leave out the part about Congress.  Tom Daschle was the Senate Majority Whip.  The 50/50 split after the 2000 elections meant that no party had a majority, which gave the Republicans a slight edge due to the deciding vote of the Vice President.  Then, when Jim Jeffords quit the Republican Party in May of 2001 to become an Independent, the Democrats held a 50/49 edge over the Republicans.  I'm guessing the reason some people say the Republicans had a majority in Congress for six years was because technically they did.  That does not mean they had total control over everything and could do as they wanted, as some seem to indicate.  Just as many seem to believe the small majority Dems held from 2007-2009 was at all meaningful.  Lots of misunderstanding, misinformation and overstating shouted form both sides.  This is hardly a Democrat phenomenon.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	That's right!  I remember when Jumpin Jim Jeffords turned traitor and switched parties.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Because he did.

I don't think Affirmative Action has prevented any discrimination in the workplace.

Quite the contrary, affirmative action laws give a strong encintive to offer opportunities to those favored by them that might be denied equally qualified persons of a legally disfavored demoagraphic.  There is a risk involved in to making such allowances or sticking to infomral 'quotas.'      Under these laws, actual discrimination in intent does not have to be proved, only a 'pattern' of discrimination need be shown.

In the case of banks, for instance, depositors.  The people whose money banks are playing shell games with might be rich, middle class or even poor (even if you have a checking account, and it's empty the day after you deposit your paycheck, your bank still turned around and loaned out 20 times the money you deposited, overnight).    The idea of a bail out to banks is to avoid bank failures, which are tremendously expensive to the FDIC - whether the current round of bailouts (that went to some financial institutions other than banks, and not to others in identical straights) actually cost less than letting a wave of bank failures cascade through the economy is debateable.    And, yes, it is interesting that the same dems who so decried the Bush deficits are ready to sign on for an extra helping of the same from Obama.  Kudos to you for sticking to your guns on this one.

Remember them adjusting the prime interest rate every so often. They were covering it up basically, hoping it would go away.    Normally a war would've fixed it but wars don't supply jobs like they used to. No jobs, no economy. No matter how much you spend. Instead of producing what we need, we import it.|`|fSEiHz8Gaa	Spend, as in giving money to the banks with no strings attached...that kind of spend?|`|AA10818613	Bush didn't try to spend our way out of a recession.  He just gave all our treasury to the CEO's in the banks and to Halliburton and the military industrial corporate complex all the while cutting taxes for the rich.

The ASVAB + physical tell the detailers what jobs you are qualified for.  They will probably pressure you to choose a job right then, but you really don't have to.  Nor do you have to swear into the delayed enlistment program right then, although they may tell you you do.    If you're unsure what you want, just do the physical, tell them you're not quite ready to pick a job, and go back to see your recruiter.      Do a little research on the jobs, and work with your recruiter.  Give him or her a list of 7 or 8 things you think you'd like to do, and wait for a job you want.  You'll be doing it for four, or six years...long time to hate your job.    There are several open areas...general, electrical, mechanical, etc., but you need to know what's in those general areas before you just agree.  You should never sign anything unless you know what you're getting into.|`|ExYfur9haa	yea, u have to take your physical, (blood, urine, ht weight, sight, hearing, etc), plus, u may have to spread ur cheeks(guys)..... once u complete that u have to strip down to your boxer/briefs with a room full of guy and do certain things that the doctor will say, (EX: duck walk, touch your toes) then he will give u your physicall scores...    NOTE: just because ur score with the ASVAB may let u qualify for a job at the beginning, ur physical score may not let u qualify for the job, Example, u cannot get many airborne jobs if u failed the depth perception portion of the physical exam....     so after u DEP in (sometimes before).... u sit down with a counselor and select no less then 5 jobs that u full qualify for, unless u have to take other tests as well (DLAB, PAST).... u must also select one of the 4 areas that u are willing to take any job in if they cannot get u a job that u initially wanted.... plus yes u DO have to go with that thena at basic they will show u the jobs in that area that u can choose from right then, who knows, u may even find a job that u wanted in the first place!!!.....        one thing i can suggest is, pick more then just 5 jobs, itll give the counselor more options to choose what you want rather than getting that general job....    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|2oUhQQ5Raa	I'm not in the Airforce man so I really don't know.|`|b01dgtZyaa	Depending on your ASVAB score you could be qualified for many different jobs. If you score in the high 90s, you will be qualified for most military jobs. In this case, you can either tell your recruiter you want to wait for a certain job slot to open and get put into DEP(delayed entry program) for a while. Or if you want to ship out soon, ask him what jobs are open now or have him put you down for open general. If you go Open General, theres no tellin what you will end up getting.

Thus, it would depend upon many factors, with, the experimental DESIGN being a major component.    Why?  What are you referring...|`|zftm6qkKaa	What element?

The government should not be the ones running around willy nilly looking for dangerous things, let the watchdog groups and the scientists do it.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	I have tried to be educated and informed on a range of topics.  On this one, I think that I could be better informed.  If the funding were to be a voluntary request for me to give up some money for the research, I would need more information before making a decision.  More likely, I would probably pay a company with a proven track record and whose only function was to perform such research.    Since you write that this research would be funded by the federal government, I stress caution.  The federal government has oversight over countless funded activities, and the money that funds them is not exactly voluntarily provided.  As a result, moral hazard abounds.  No amount of money is "sufficient" to the person receiving it, while a bureaucrat or politician who directs funding is not tied to consider limitations since it is not his money.    This is why government grows without bounds.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	None|`|7zf05NWsaa	$1.00|`|BrjZhySIaa	Well, anytime it is 'funded by the government' ... just add about $100,000,000 per day of research.    In all seriousness, it depends on what the element is you are researching.  Is it a common substance?  What kind of research is already in place?

jEYZkIrhaa	This is what happens when you try to ignore a problem rather than solving it.     Instead of getting these terrorists convicted and sentenced, we're now trapped with a situation that the evidence to convict might be gone, we have to move them to American prisons, and there's a good chance they'll have to be let go and they'll rejoin the war against us.    And even if they're not American citizens they still have rights. We're not savages, after all.    And what do you mean "no proof"? I'm pretty sure getting shot at is plenty of proof, if you ask me. And I don't see any political dissenters, which is a relief.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	He wishes with his belly button.  Most of those prisoners would be prisoners of war if they had guts to put on a uniform and stop hiding behind women and children like the HAMAS.  As such they are actually entitled to hanging as spys.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	The only way we can solve this dilemma is to classify the detainees as 'prisoners of war' even though they are not part of a country's regular military.  Then, we can hold them without charge for as long as the war lasts.  However, if we did that, then they are covered by the Geneva Conventions and we would not be able to torture them any more, and we would have to give the Red Cross and other international organizations access to them.  The previous administration did not want to do this because then they could not use 'enhanced interrogation methods' such as water boarding.|`|AA12218954	I would say 2 weeks is enough time to gather charges against a suspect.    If after two weeks no charge has been brought, the suspect walks.    If charges are brought, they must be publicized and the suspect must have the right to obtain some form of representation.

How will you explain it to the American people if one or more of them plays a part in the planning and or killing of Americans? How seriously do you take National security. Obviously the "rights" of these killers trumps the rights of the American people in your book. Do they also trump our right to keep our families safe from them? Do you really understand the type of people we are dealing with? Do you really understand their ideology?

I tried to post the highlights of it days ago and was told it was still too long.  Unbelievable that people don't even want to read about what is going on in this country!  Just blind faith that Obama will do the right thing.  And that is what he is counting on.  So much that he tried to get this pushed through before anyone found out (I mean us).  That didn't work but he is still trying to get it passed before anymore find out.    And the pat answer will be "but Bush spent too."

The Republicans have a plan that will cost 1/2 of this proposed plan and create twice as many jobs -- 6.2 million, but Dems won't budge...wasteful spending.    A lot of that spending is for as much as 4 years in the future...jamming as much spending in this bill as they can.      H.R. HoG    I still say that's not good enough.  ======================================  Chi Guy -- if you were objective, you wouldn't constrain yourself w/ petty reasons not to be informed.

Who are the ones who put this country $12 Trillion in additional debt, not including the war. It sure wasn't Obama!    I guess you just want a COMPLETE economic meltdown, instead of losing 1/2 MILLION jobs a MONTH.

Don't you remember the last stimulus package?  75% of people told them to vote against it but they voted for it anyway.   Obviously they don't care what their constituents think, they will do whatever they want to do.  We should throw them all out and start over, starting with Pelosi.|`|AA10818613	I've read the bill, all 647 pages.  The bill includes provisions to prevent more job loss in the form of firefighters, cops, teachers, healthcare, information broadband infrastructure completion, and a lot of other things that people take for granted that are needed and actully do create jobs.  Including art.  Actually, an amendment introduced to the bill (H.R.1, http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?... was voted for in the Senate specifically for immediate infrastructure funding to the states that have projects that can be started as soon as the bill passes. I watched on CSPAN this morning.  It will get money out to the states in a very rapid pace.  Even thought the big stimulus bill hasn't gotten to the Senate yet, they are already working on it.    I've already read the bill that the congress is working on.  This bill will prevent many jobs from being lost.  Jobs like education jobs, police and firefighter jobs that would be cut if the cities, counties and states didn't get any funding they need to keep these jobs.  There are also pell grant increases to allow people's kids to keep going to school.  At this point in time, we don't want families to have to put their kids education on hold.  That would mean more unemployment for those families.  The bill also calls for more unemployment because most states are running out of unemployment funds and it provides more money for food stamps because people have to feed their families.  Or would you rather people starve when there are no jobs to be found?  Obama not only promised to create more jobs he also promised to help stop the jobs from being lost.  This is, in fact, part of the congressional bill as well.    Obama hasn't lied at all.  And, you haven't proven that he lied.  What you are proving is that you listen to the GOP who got us into this mess in the first place.|`|jEYZkIrhaa	I WILL READ IT DAMNIT.|`|5525f87d71ed14135409bd627ca7c322aa	Sorry, I don't click on links posted in here; however, I have read several articles and things sent to me by American Family Association and the like.  I'm not impressed with the overall bill.  No health care, abortions, artwork or etc. should be included in it.  If they want to create jobs by making more wind energy, so be it.  They could also start using more of our own fuel and then there'd be more jobs here as well.  Had the left not started a dirty rumor, the American people wouldn't have panicked and made the economy like it is today.|`|o8Gxyjphaa	That is just sick. we should actually do something about this but that's just my opinion. you're not alone.:)|`|d7570355e6c141f9b4bc359d2fb03aa1aa	I can tell by the contents most of the money goes back to themselves.

The other part of it is that you need to find some other moms and see if you can work out some child care.  Use your computer.  The base also has listings both on and off the base.  Look for jobs with flexible hours.  18 years ago, I was in a similar position.  When we were both home, he would drop me at work (ridiculously early) then the kiddo at daycare, then pick us up later in reverse order.  It wasn't easy, but it was possible.

Even with the graveyard shift, your hubby's hours are never guaranteed, which means that he may have to be gone during that time too.  When I was in, my husband did work part time at night and stayed home with our sons during the day, but that's only because I was on shore duty (Navy) and my hours were very regular and he was able to switch shifts when I had watch.  The sucky part was that we never got to see each other.  Really think through every aspect before you make your decision.

My husband TOTALLED our second car (I know right!!) and we had just one for about two months. I dropped him off before PT and picked him up at 1630. It was a hardship, but we made it work. AND we live 13 minutes from his company! So living 30 minutes away is a hard one to fix. You'll have to find somewhere to work within walking distance. So the school job would be great for you!!|`|4VzVfKvdaa	I assume you live in Marysville or Yuba City since you said Beale.   Why doesn't your husband leave you the car and carpool until you get a second vehicle?  What if the kids need to go to the doctor?  We lived on base there and I rode a bicycle so my wife could have a car for the kids until I got a second car. We also made a lot of friends there who were very gracious with rides.  One family even loaned us one of their extra cars for a month while the weather was too rainy for me to ride the bike. That area just isn't convenient for a one car family.

There are 2 main reasons for middle easter conflict:    Firstly, Islam is a degenerative and barbaric religion. Shariah law, and current islamic states are proof of this, no jews have caused the taliban to stone 12 year old girls to death-as a punishment for wearing provocative clothes.No westerners have implemented laws on afghanistan saying women arent entitled to education and are not allowed to leave their house without their husband.  I dont hate individual muslims, but what they are made to believe in.Islam has made no scientific advances in hundreds of years.Middle eastern states like iraq and iran should be developed countries, they are countries that have oil the rest of the world relies on.But all the money has made its way to rich dictators and saudi princes rather than your average street going muslim-the morals are all wrong.Also, muslims have been fighting amongst themselves for centuries in the Middle east.    Secondly putting a big fat westernised yank sponsered zionist Jewish state right in the middle of a load of islamic states wasn't the best of ideas was it?!  Make no mistake If Israel didnt exist half the problem would go away.|`|0hrq96wqaa	That twat Wolfie means the Zionists who AREN'T Jews--in other words, when someone who isn't in charge of Israel is removed from office.

While the word Jew remains taboo, in respect to it, so Israel remains taboo, and untouchable.  Then, when the connection is recognised and the exemption is revoked, THEN Israel will have to comply with the rules that bind the rest of us.  Peace.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	So much of it seems to be related to Israel and the Palestinians.      I don't think peace will happen until the Palestinians have their own homeland, and the 2 are separated.    I envision it as Israel giving the Palestinians enough land to form their own country AND include a military barrier, along the lines of the Korean DMZ.  It should be a strip of barren land with walls, barbed wire, land mines, guard towers, etc. to separate the 2 lands.  The 2 countries should then have nothing to do with each other.    After this is set up, any attack by Palestinians, say rocket attacks, should be met with exactly 10 times the force.
