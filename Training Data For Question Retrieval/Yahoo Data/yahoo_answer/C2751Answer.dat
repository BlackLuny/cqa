AA10327148	I looked up the list of toxic and safe plants. the bottlebrush plant is on the non-toxic (safe)  list> http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pag...|`|9eac0cbc7f3026475f513e7076b2799faa	Have you spoken with your vet about the dog possible having epilepsy?  Certain smells, sounds, & changes in light can trigger a mild seizure. Like human epileptics having problems with strobe lights. A mild seizure, unlike a grand mal, usually produce a "out of it" kinda of reaction. They stare into space, if you call them they ignore you, and sometimes they will urinate.    Has this happened around any other plant or time? I have a pot belly pig that this happens to. He is now on a low dose anti-seizure med that has helped.|`|AA12095741	This is such an interesting question. Perhaps it's the pollen on the plant. Or, perhaps your terrier simply got irritated from sniffing the plant and appeared to be spacey. Either way, it's an an interesting and unusual scenario!|`|b04d793885feff35782c1e718a8feafeaa	Your Staffie could be picking up on the plants pheromones or pollens and it is giving her a little bit of a buzz?? Or she could be having some type of allergic reaction. Above and beyond just for her safety, I'd keep her totally away from the plant!   If you can not keep her from the plant (and I'd see no reason why you couldn't) and she continues to sniff the plant and continues to have the same reaction, I would seriously talk to veterinarian about it. It is not one of the plants listed as toxic to dogs..   A good example of changed behavior from plants is cats and catnip. Cats display a strange reaction to the catnip plant. Cats are sensitive to the chemical nepetalactone in the plant and it changes their behavior.  Keep a good eye on her.
bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Yes. You can spread this around the yard, as well as rub a bit in your cat's fur.     It kills fleas by drying up there outer "shell", once that's done they don't survive long.

It would not be good for your cat to inhale - it can be hard on the lungs.  I doubt it would do much to kill the fleas.|`|0635a845f66f1560993ef88c99cce9c7aa	Nope. That's really more of an herbal remedy and it's really old school. You want to fix your cat's fleas? Take it to a vet. That's going to be your only option. Even over the counter remedies aren't always going to be effective and they don't care for the entire problems fleas can cause. You really need to go to a vet.
67PZ2nj3aa	It sounds to me that Summer is just trying to let the new puppy know that Summer's bed is Summer's bed.  She doesnt want to share her space because she views herself as a more dominant member of your "pack" or family. If she is friendly with the puppy except for around her bed, i would leave the situation alone and keep the puppy away from Summer's bed.     If she's always grumpy around the puppy, expecially around her bed, try taking them on a walk to get Summer acustomed to the new puppy. This will show her that the puppy is a part of the family.|`|c0891ea2ea03da317d33b4fa589f4d03aa	oh, dont worry!   if its a new puppy, obviously you are going to be paying alot of attention to it!  so, Summer, is jealous!  all she is trying to do is tell the puppy, "hey! i was here first! i'm the boss!"   as Summer gets to know your puppy, they will get along fine, trust me!|`|IVKYoMmXaa	youir older dog is teaching your younger dog a very important social lesson, as long as she isnt really doing damage i would step back and just watch the dogs communicating its quite fascinating how dogs teach puppies how to be dogs|`|647e8a48ad9fe5f5763a7ce619d1e9ffaa	All dogs do that at other dogs once in a while so...Try putting one dog in one cage then put the other in a another.Also if that doesn't work and they bark at each other trying giving them a squeaky toy sold at Wal-Mart or Pet supplies Plus.|`|dX0ZIlCmaa	She's being territorial. That's HER bed not the puppy's and she's telling the puppy it better back off. She's probably also jealous because you have to give puppies a lot more attention then adult dogs. Try giving her attention and treats more. If you get the puppy a toy get her something. If it keeps up keep them apart until the puppy can protect itself. If it only happens when the puppy comes near Summer's bed then just keep the puppy away from her territory and things should be fine. Good luck.|`|298176e2fd806948e80bb60786fe3b50aa	as soon as he growls at the puppy, say no like you mean it and slap the dog in the rear, and let them know that your serious. they'll start playing with eachother soon. its going to take a little time to get used to the puppy. and also don't give one more love than the other.

z1slJ3Lyaa	a good rule of thumb is that if both dog are for the most part equally dishing it out then its OK. if one dog is obviously dominating the other, break them apart and restrain the dominat one while the other has a chance to smell and check him out. do not in any way FORCE the submissive dog to check out the aggressor, if you do you may emotionally scare him.    Also if both dogs are equally playing and the start making a lot of aggressive noise (barking, growling, etc.) it is a good idea to separate and let them relax as not to escalate to more aggressive level.    one thing you may try to get him to stop is, use a treat and have him lie down while another dog comes up to him. it will help in making him calmer during introductions and playtime|`|68fd826cba299cf64f362a0d09b44654aa	I think the biting needs to stop.

33ca26bbdb5e854ecaf8b2b9b1915519aa	Its really not a easy question to answer, Boxers come in a lot of sizes from 40 to 100 lbs. So it depends on the parents how big the puppies should be at that age. Just make sure they are healthy and none of there bones are sticking out and they should be fine.  I would say normally between 10 and 20 depending on the size it will be full grown.|`|h2U9Roa0aa	8 or 9 weeks for a boxer, they are still sorta small i would say somewhere around 20 lbs|`|UliPjOr6aa	2,856        {:=  |`|bf91f2af20d86383b5d8fb2e89d5b074aa	8,000,985,139,000 penalkez
TUco8dDaaa	your bunny is just fine. I wouldn't worry at all. This is very common when a rabbit is tired or especially when they are hot.  Your bunny is probably just hot, its like when a dog pants with its tongue out. Its normal.    I hope this eased your worries!|`|e62331d279795235ed294762ae7b0220aa	It should be heatstroke. My friend had a bunny who has the same syndromes as yours and his bunny is placed under the hot sun. So I think it should be heatstroke|`|U93VpYtMaa	Just put a dark curtain up over the window and get a fan and turn it on low. then direct it at 'em and walla!!!! thats the way I would do it!!!! Hope your bunny is ok...|`|kKQOGs1naa	Your bunny could be having a heatstroke. It takes a small amount of time for them to dehydrate and die.  Make sure your bunny has plenty of water, which is essential for it to maintain its energy and health.  Keep an eye on it on and off for the next couple of hours.  Also make sure to get it out of the sun, the shaking is usually brought on by heat and a mechanism a bunny uses to cool itself down.   So place it in a well vented and well shaded area.|`|krXQaZAfaa	Without seeing your bun I cannot make an accurate assessment whether she is in heat stroke or she got herself all winded from running around.  My best advice would to be to carefully watch her for the next 10 minutes, if she is still in distress... I highly recommend a trip to the vet.  You rather be safe than sorry!    However, if your bunny is having DIFFICULTY breathing or suffering from heat, or is in any apparent distress, this could be a life-threatening situation!! Please contact your vet immediately!!     Rabbits are prey animals, and so they will instinctually hide any weakness that may make them more vulnerable to a predator. Many people tell the same sad story that their bunny seemed just fine the day before, but in reality the day before the bunny was just hanging on, and now is crashing.     Rabbits can very easily suffer from heat stroke. It is important that your rabbit can find shade (if your rabbit spends time in a cage, make sure it isn't in direct sunlight) and stay cool. Rabbits do not have a way to cool themselves off like other pets - in the wild they go underground to stay cool.     Hope this helps.
ILm6FTdJaa	It takes consistency, a lot longer than just a week. He's a puppy and he's just excited to explore his world.   I have a Sibe and I can't let him off leash. He bolts and will not come back. He has also jumped or climbed the fence and he also learned to open the gate just as yours did.   My final solution was to buy a 30 foot tie out and chain. He can still run, but can't get loose and run away.   As for the collar, you should be able to slip no more than two fingers under his collar when it's on properly. If you can get more than two fingers under it's too loose. You can also buy choke collars until he learns to walk on leash and not try to slip out of his collar. These don't hurt the dog. They have really nice nylon ones that work really well.   Don't give up, training takes work and time. Use small training treats with lots of praise. He'll get the hang of it.|`|bc8CRzj7aa	Dont really know but it reminded of a story; a friend of mine has a dog named "roaminoff" when i asked her where she got the name she said "caue he keeps Roaming off" any way just thought that was funny but seriously maybe you just have to let him and see if he comes back, you know maybe he is the kinda dog that will just kick it in the yard if he knows he is not gonna be tied. thats what they did with "roaminoff" now he just sits by the front door and sleeps most of the day|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Change the latch on the gate so he cannot open it.  Dogs don't have opposable thumbs, so there is a latch system that he can't open.    Make the fence higher so he can't jump or build him a dog run with angled fencing on the top or a roof.  Find a way to keep him the yard no matter what.  But don't chain him up - this makes dogs aggressive.    Enroll him in an obedience class.  You need to learn how to train him.  Keep going until you teach him how to learn.  The techniques you are using don't work as you've noticed.  You need help with this part.    Use a head halter (such as a Halti or a Gentle Leader) - he won't be able to slip it or pull.  If that doesn't work, use a prong collar - these work when nothing else does and they are humane - they don't hurt the dog and they are safer than choke chains.    Walk this dog every day.  All the escaping is a sign he needs more exercise.  He is going nuts with boredom.    Take some time and get educated.  You have a mix of two very active and very smart breeds and a young dog in the terrible teens.  Education and taking charge of the situation is what you need.|`|D2Hm3nhBaa	try borrowing a neighbour/friends well trained dog and it just might work to train your dog by example...praise the good one alot & give lots of treats and maybe your dog might just click and think "hey that could b me"      only thing i could think of.....hope it helps|`|5842cbd9b92850ff74c45212f92fcc8faa	You have a large breed dog and you need to be walking this dog at least an hour daily. With the right amount of excercise and discipline, the problem should be solved. I never recommend using a normal collar for walking, for the exact reason you stated, they slip out of the collars. I recommend either a halti/gentle leader (head collar) or a pinch collar. NEVER use a choke chain, those are way too dangerous. Put barb wire or something of the sort at the top of your fence, and pad lock the gate. And walk the dog for about 1 1/2 hours a day to 2 hours a day, plus additional play time.|`|qrjjo7AJaa	You're having problems and you're trying to get help.  That's great.    First issue.  When training a dog the problem isn't with the dog, the problem is with the PERSON.  You appear to be close to that issue.    1 - You should go to an obedience class.  That will get you to where you want to be the fastest.  The purpose of these classes goes beyond training the dog, the purpose is to train YOU.  2 - You can't do that, or choose not to do that.  My best suggestion is to get the book, "Don't Shoot the Dog" by Karen Pryor.   3 - Nothing in Life is Free.  Website http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm|`|X4oAaxhdaa	my dog is sometimes like that, we got a chain that is metal kinda, sold in walmart, where they can slip out but you can pull them back home and they can't get out of it. My dog, we keep saying come on, and treat him part of family and just call him funny and keep beckoning her. it may work for you|`|kme71ipaaa	Exercising the dog is definitely key.  I would suggest 4Rk9's training which is all positive reinforcement.  I would also say that once your dog hits 3-4 years of age, he'll be the best dog you've ever had.  We get lots of labs into our rescue at 1 year of age for many of the reasons you've listed. They are wonderful dogs if you can get through the young and teenage years.  When he's off and running, either grab the car and call him over for a ride or whistle and run the other way, he will more than likely chase you.  It's a game to him and he wants to be chased.  When you DO get him back, do not scold him.  Tell him he's a good boy for coming to you, even if you had to try for an hour :(|`|D3UTjFTIaa	Make sure you are walking him daily, he might just be overly excited from the lack of exercise, and he might assume that you will be bringing him in soon.    Try using a harness instead of a collar, one that will go under his arms as well as around his neck. When you are walking don't stop when he wants to stop, you lead the way, make sure you are in control at all times. You decide when he can stop. Maybe try riding your bike or roller blading with him, to tire him out a little quicker.    Also is he fixed? If not he might smell other female dogs in heat in his area and might be trying to find them. If not getting him fixed will take a bit of this out of him as well|`|f15ebdd88753f8e5650594026202f5bcaa	FIRST OF DONT BE AN IDIOT AND PUT BARB WIRE UP THE DOG WILL DESTROY ITS PAWS.  ALSO CHOKE CHAINS ARE KIND OF DANGEROUS IF YOU DONT TAKE YOUR DOG FOR A WALK.  THE BEST THING TO DO IS GET ONE OF THOSE COLLARS THAT GOES AROUND THEIR FACES BUT LETS THEM OPEN THEIR MOUTHS I FORGET WAT THEIR CALLED.  Picture     -->            http://www.azbeaglerescue.com/metadot/in...    Also try a shock collar w/ fence.  All you do is put a red wire around where you want your dog to be (ie. your property ) and put the red collar on.  It will give them a little jolt whenever they cross the line. Its safe too, just dont put it on your dog if you want to take it for a walk.  Also if your dog can jump a fence, it can jump the wire so try lacing the wire at the top of the fence.  Eventually your dog will learn not to cross the fence and you can take it down.          ALSO PLAY WITH IT LOTS AND WALK IT

dd7d183976aacfdca4bf19dbf171aa78aa	?por qu el "terror" a poner una bomba de aire?    Si quieremos tener una pecera lo mejor es tenerla bien equipada..... bueno.... esa es mi idea.    Mira, los bettas no necesitan de la bomba de aire porque son peces laberntidos que respiran oxgeno del aire ms que del agua, por eso se recomienda djar un espacio entre la superficie del agua y la tapa de la pecera si es que se cuenta con una, o al menos no cometer la salvajada de tapar el aire con una plantita y cosad de esas que solo da?an al pez.    Laberntidos existen ms que los bettas, los gouramis por ejemplo son tambin del mismo tipo de peces y pueden convivir con otros gouramis, hay distintos tipos como los azules, los moteados y los gouramis miel.    El asunto es que son pece mas grandes y necesitan peceras ms grandes.  A ser una pecera ms grande con ms agua necesitar de un filtro para que el agua no se corrompa despidiendo malos olore y ofreciendo una vista turbia y sucia.

As I recall, Wobbler's syndrome tends to afflict dobes sometimes.|`|AA10421992	I understand what you are describing, like head tremors. I asked a vet about this years ago and all I was told was it must be some sort of chemical imbalance, and the dog would out grow it. Well as the dog got older he did have them less often, but still had the tremors once in a great while.Besides that the dog had no other health problems. This dog did it even while he was inside the house so it was not caused by the heat. I hope your vet gives you a better explanation then the one I got many years ago!!!|`|M1at6KE9aa	You will need to keep the Dobie out of the heat and the hot sun.  It sounds as though he's getting overheated and if he gets sun stroke he could die.  A wet towel will help to keep his body temperature down and there are also cooling mats made especially for dogs.      Lucky you to have a Mexican Hairless.  They are very rare here in the US.|`|AA10288031	I would take him to the vet. It almost sounds like heat stroke or something, but this could be really dangerous. Your best bet is taking your dog to the vet.|`|qGqFwsrXaa	Thats sad, I love Dobermans. You should keep him out of the heat and spray him often to prevent it happening. He could get heat stroke. You should take him to the vet to be on the safe side, it could be something serious.    Good luck!|`|qw5ZbxM0aa	oh my gosh I'm so sorry to hear this.  I can relate to you. You see, my grandma had a doberman. His name was Sam, and he had diabetes. He would get seizers.( see-zers however you spell it) and anyway, he had died of it. These 'seizers' can be caused from diebetes. Maybe your dog has diebetes? I think you should call a veternarian as soon as possible. If not, then go online like google.com and type in your question but sum it up. Anyway, sorry to hear this and i hope your dog gets better.   Hope my answer helped...    From,  Noel L.
f625761b9315ce30edb7ef310c33bf77aa	probably mites my friends dog was losing all his hair in 1 spot and they found out eventually that it was mites....there is a cure where they put your dog to sleep (for surgery) they scrape the dogs skin for a sample and they give special mite bath that will kill them all. hopefully thats whats wrong. otherwise look for a bump on the dog it could also possibly be cancer...check in with the vet with these 2 options and hopefully they will leave you a good answer.good luck and best wishes|`|OqWjmJcJaa	Hmm. You really should take her to the vet and have them look at it. There are a lot of rashes that are minor and common and can be treated at home with over the counter products, but what you are describing is not one of those kind of rashes. Even though she doesn't seem to be bothered by it, it is very abnormal and she really needs to be seen by a vet to determine if it is serious, and to get you something to treat it with.|`|c741f2ea044bb7b631f12f8f89cc3e68aa	it can be anything from skin allergies to mites. You won't know until its checked by a vet.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Is it completely round like a possible ringworm? They don't have blisters though.     And if there are blisters that really sounds like the start of demodectic mange, but it's not as usual in this breed as in some others like pits.
xeBNVSvKaa	omg    take her to the vet dummy|`|522221c86ac8ff7e4528599c3304c559aa	google in cesar milan, and go to his website.  he has an "ask the vet" section.  also, petco may be helpful  but by all means, take your dog in to the vet. You don't wanna mess around with anything serious.  cough and heavy breathing could be a symptom of a serious condition, like congestive heart failure, or pneumonia.  I hope she's ok.|`|AA11719807	http://www.canine-seizures.freeservers.c...|`|463GFTG8aa	I'd call my vet first.  On the internet, I often use vetinfo.  There's vetinfo4dogs and vetinfo4cats.

M3jRtq2Aaa	It won't hurt her if you can get it down.  They don't like it though.    Why did she have pneumonia?  Are you sure it was bacterial?   Sometimes heart problems can cause pneumonia.   What drugs did he give her exactly? If it was just antibiotics then it probably was bacterial, but if he gave her some lasix she may have a heart issue.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	It's better than her being dehydrated. Why wouldn't you have called the vet 3 days ago when she stopped eating and drinking?!? I would have gone in when the problem started and got things back on track.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Yes it works the same on dogs as it does with babies. My vet recommended it to me.|`|9936c2f603b009add8c2219520e8dedaaa	Your vet may be able to suggest a "doggie" remedy istead of a human one.    This may be safer for her.  They have supplemental formula and such at pet stores.|`|AA12260782	Yes, it's good for her.  Works the same for dogs as it does for humans.    Also consider getting meat baby food (lamb and turkey is best).  Water it down to liquid with the Pedialyte and give it with the syringe.    They need calories as well as proper hydration to get well.    There is also Nutrical and other paste supplements for just this problem.  Get them at pet stores.    Good luck|`|JrnXCy49aa	So you can't get to the vet, how about calling them, that you can do anytime ;)|`|envnOVXgaa	both pedialyte and gatorade will be fine to give her.  gatorade has more sugar than pedialyte, so if she is not eating, it may be better to give her that instead so she will get more calories in.  as she starts to drink more, start adding water to it so she stays hydrated and doesn't get too much sugar|`|HKilQK3Faa	If at all possible, I'd try to consult with a vet. Even a 24 hour emergency vet will be able to answer a question like this at no charge. All pedialyte is though is water with added electrolytes and vitamins (and some have flavoring.) It's OK to give to an infant. I would assume it would be fine to give to a dog. Definately get her seen though and if you can ask a vet, that'd be good. Good luck! I hope your doggy feels better!!|`|32lgAdP8aa	My vet showed me how to 'force' pedialyte to my sick dogs.  I took one of those fat syringes, filled it up about half way, put it in between the teeth on the side of the dogs mouth, holding her head firmly, and then pushed the syringe plunger slowly and steadily.  The dog is forced to swallow.  Of course some will come out, but the point is that some will go in.  I have also used Gatorade, but it is not nearly as effective because it has too many additives - including sugar.  Pedialyte is definitely the best choice.  You could also try to feed her bland food, such as overcooked white rice and chicken broth, or even baby foods that are high in protein.|`|XqUMszEsaa	Yes, that's fine or you can even use Gatorade. It's just as good and much cheaper. However, if fluids by syrigne is all she;s had in 3 days..I would get her in tomorrow. Dehydration can be very serious and 3 days is a long time without ample fluid.|`|kTjDOteIaa	Pedialyte is great for them... most vets perscribed it!  Gatorade would work also...  But ANYTHING with electrolytes in it!   You want to keep her hydrated and that's what electrolytes do!    If you are a horse person or live in a town with even a feed store around. You can buy electrolyte powder (usually apple flavor)... mix it with water and give it to her. That way she isn't gettin the sugars that gatorade... etc. has in them!    But anything with a good amount of electrolytes works.    If she worsens your vet can put her on JUST an IV. W/O meds!!! But pediatlyte will work until friday. Even if she doesnt want it!    Good Luck|`|Wp96BULnaa	All vets have emergency on-call services.  I would check with them first.  If your regular vet can't see her until Friday find a vet that has walk-in service.|`|17AABadqaa	Yep, I agree, Pedialyte is great!!!!!!  Did you try ice cubes?  GOOD LUCK.  You could try making a "gruel" with some canned food and warm water.

Make friends with the neighbors, so they don't mind.  2. Get an invisible fence, and bury the wire between the yards  3. Run a temporary electric eye or Deer detector and connect it to a noise maker or water gun.  4. Walk into the other yard and if she follows, shake a penny can at her.  5. Have the neighbors shake a penny can at her for about a week.    Hope one of these will help|`|9AMWNA3Aaa	get a fence is all i could say that can help here  itll be tough training your dog but possible.   every time she goes over to the other yard scream eh! and get her attention. eventually eh! will ba all you need to say and she will come back and will get used to staying in the yard|`|BoVGq49naa	While you may live in a private area and do not leash your dog, you may want to use a long tie out if you want it to stay in your yard that bad.  The tie out can help show her how far she can go.  My dogs always go out on tie outs because the last thing I would ever want to happen is for them to see something and take off.  No matter how much a dog loves you there are some things that they love more (rabbits, kids,) They now only go as far as their lease on the rare occasion they make it out the door before I get them hooked up.    There is nothing wrong with a 30 foot tie out for a dog.  Its a matter of safety.|`|eplh2hZhaa	try one of those invisible fences.
f15ebdd88753f8e5650594026202f5bcaa	My cat never gets dirty ears but my dog does and she hates etting them cleaned so i just sneak up on her, and put hydrogen peroxide (3%) solution on a piece of paper towel and gently wipe out her ear.  Then i put two or three drops of eye/ear drops into her ear and rup her ear up against her head (massage) so the liquid stays.  Do this twice every day if its red.  If it is normal color just use hydrogen peroxide on a cloth.  The hydrogen should clean out the deep grooves in her ears.  Don't rub too hard though, they have sensitive ears.  If this doesn't work, get a chocolate lab.  Mine likes to lick out my cats ears, and im pretty sure my cat enjoys it.

E2YqPsVXaa	Remember the Punnett square from high school biology where you tried to figure out the offspring of Drosophila fruit flies and snow peas? Hahaha. Well, the answer to your question lies in this Punnett square and recalling facts about dominant genes and recessive genes.    I assume the rottie has brown eyes, as they normally do. In fact, it's rare to find a rottie with lighter color eyes, although I've seen a few with blue eyes, kind of like a husky's eyes, but never green (doesn't mean there aren't any out there I just haven't seen).     Let's start by assigning a code to the color of the eyes. In this case, we will go with upper case letter B for the color brown (dominant), and lower case letter b for green (recessive).    Assuming the rottie's eye colors are brown, that is her dominant gene. Most likely she is a BB (dominant brown from both her parents) rather than Bb (dominant and recessive gene, one from each parent). Remember, her phenotype, or the exterior appearance, is determined by this makeup. As long as a dominant gene exists, it always masks the recessive gene, hence dominant :)    The sire, the pit bull has green eyes, which makes his genetic code or makeup bb. Keep in mind that the only way a recessive gene can be represented phenotypically (i.e. exterior appearance), he would have had to receive the recessive gene code from both his parents.    Therefore, hypothetically speaking.... If your pitbull (bb) mates with a rottie with dominant genes only (BB), then the boxes in your Punnett square should yield this projection for their offsprings: All puppies will carry the Bb alleles, but none of them will physically have green eyes, because the dominant brown will mask the green.    Again, hypothetically speaking.... If your pitbull (bb) mates with a rottie with a recessive gene masked by dominant (Bb), then look how this changes the projection of the offsprings' eye colors. There will be 50:50 chance that any of the puppies could be Bb (brown-eyed) or bb (green-eyed).     Tada~~~~!!! See how easy this is? LOL. Hope that answers your question (and gave you a review in biology)!|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	maybe.  but why are you breeding mixed breed pups.  don't you think there are enough pit mixes and rott mixes being killed everyday in shelters?  as far as the eyes. like any inherited trait, some pups might and some might not.

8NSh1D4Maa	Check out the book 'Clicker Training for Rabbits'.  Do note that rabbits are prey animals, they fear humans instinctively, and it is very difficult to train something like 'sit'.  Your rabbit isn't stubborn, they're just a rabbit, and they do not behave at all like other pets like cats and dogs.  They require a great deal of patience, a very very gentle and positive approach, and an owner who understands that rabbits are not dogs or cats and need to be treated differently.|`|NOVLHX3Maa	Here is an article detailing some tips on how to train your rabbit including how to make it sit.
AA11887983	They can sleep either way.  Because they are prey animals, they have evolved to be able to sleep standing up, so that if danger is near, they can move quickly.  They also tend to lay down only if they are really secure, like in a stall, or in a field where they feel protected.  It just takes too much to get up quickly if they need to, so they mostly doze on their feet.|`|kfgfwWBtaa	Horses sleep standing up most of the time, but occasionally sleep on the ground. <br>  <br>  Horses sleep standing up most of the time because of the dangers they face in the wild when they sleep on the ground. <br>  <br>  When horses sleep on the ground, they are taking a risk.

Turning this cavy in to a shelter is probably the best thing that could happen to it, at this point!<br>  <br>  Having Guinea pigs myself, I can't imagine what must have happened to this one to turn it into a biter!  This is something that, normally, Guinea pigs just don't do!

The Guinea pig as we know it hasn't been "wild" for a very long time... even in it's native habitat of South America.  The "wild" cavies seen there now are thought to be either previously domesticated feral animals, or descendants of another closely-related cavy species.(1)   <br>  <br>  This Guinea pig, if released in Feb--or any other month--into the "wilds" of New Jersey, is, very simply, going to die a horrible death.   Even were it released in a warm environment, with ample supplies of the types of food it requires and with some type of shelter from the elements, this pig has NO idea of how to care for itself!  Guinea pigs are domesticated animals, and they have been for generations: they are *pets*, and do not have the innate knowledge or learned skills to survive as feral!<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to the Guinea pig.

Portalo dal veterinario che gli far tutte le cure necessarie e vedrai che con il tempo imparer a fidarsi di te.|`|926da2c60c106802218f5c515f930a40aa	per conto mio  ancora impaurito, lasciali a disposizione da mangire... vedrai andr tutto bene... solo si deve ancora ambietare..... complimenti che ti prendi cura di lui|`|3CYJqE5Baa	dagli tanto amore,per adesso  impaurito,vedrai che con il tuo affetto si riprende e inizia di nuovo a mangiare|`|pKgUY50Xaa	mi associo a gimaci07 per i complimenti.  il cucciolo  ancora sotto shock,se non mangia prova a dargli del latte.  poi senti cosa dice il veterinario.    un abbraccio    elaios|`|kzK3pSdOaa	brava hai fatto un bellissimo gesto.se non mangia forse  normale,sai anke loro anno un cuore,magari xk  ancora affezzionato al suo vecchio padrone,magari lo shock di essere stato abbandonato x lui non  di certo il massimo della vita....Penso ke abbia bisogno di tempo x affezzionarsi a nuove persone,in fondo anke se  un cane  sempre un essere umano cn dei sentimenti e delle emozioni,non credi?  Vedrai ke tra un p di tempo inizier a mangiare e a giocare.Tu portalo lo stesso dal veterinario luned e ascolta anke un suo parere.Spero di esserti stata utile,un bacio a te e al nuovo membro della famiglia!Ciao!!|`|7179d2bb748f6cc548ec38658668b525aa	tu come ti sentiresti se dopo 3 anni di vita in famiglia venissi scaricata per la strada senza troppi riguardi? E' infelice, deluso e depresso..... l'unica cosa che io farei e' lasciargli acqua e cibo a vista, e non stargli troppo addosso. Quando l'istinto prendera' il sopravvento, tornera' a mangiare e sara' lui ad avvicinarsi a voi....Pensa che emozione la prima volta che verra' ad annusarti da solo, senza che tu l'abbia pregato in ginocchio...ci vuole amore, amore e amore e mi sembra che di quello tu e la tua famiglia ne abbiate tanto....E' un animale fortunato....gia' pensato al nome? Fortunello mi sembra proprio per lui..... Grazie da parte del tuo cane|`|6NUPKdnBaa	Beh prima cosa devi accertarti che stia bene cio che il motivo della sua inappetenza non sia organico...se cos non dovesse essere...beh gli animali sono molto sensibili...deve riuscire ad abituarsi a te ed incominciare a fidarsi di te....chiss cosa ha passato poverino!!!  Non essere brusca quando ti avvicini a lui e non forzarlo!!!  Sii paziente!!|`|630e660d4d1ddd1d888cc6ef1f9eea5caa	http://www.inseparabileforum.com/forum/t...    vedi il link sopra, li puoi esporre il tuo problema  Cmq secondo me dovresti dargli o del macinato crudo o cotto mischiato ai croccantini o del riso per cani|`|eSVIn90gaa	Nn mangia xk potrebbe aver paura..  prova a sedirti in terra vicino a lui...e ad offrirgli il cibo cn le mani tra una carezza e l'altra...  CI VUOLE TANTA PAZIENZA  ciao ciao|`|EUzf5wAEaa	Di lasciarlo tranquillo e di fargli tante coccole. Pu essere normale che nn mangi. Sicuramente avr fame, ma chiss che cosa ha passato prima che lo adottassi tu e sar sicuramente spaventatissimo! Per fargli avere fiducia in te prova con un pezzo di wurstel, di prosciutto crudo, di carne... nn so, con qlcs a cui i cani nn direbbero mai di no...qualcosa di un po' + saporito del biscotto.. Se ancora nn mangia, lasciagliene un po' l a disposizione. Vedrai che piano piano si sbloccher. Cmq luned portalo a fare una visitina!  Posso dare un consiglio? (Anche se forse quello che ti sto dicendo nn si potr fare...) Vedi con vet se ha il chip, se ce l'ha e come spesso a ccade i padroni nn saranno contenti di aver ritrovato il loro cucciolone, riportalo a casa con te. Se se lo riprendono loro verr abbandonato di nuovo a breve tempo, e magari la prox nn sar cos fortunato a incontrarti...  Ciao e auguri!!!|`|Zxdnr3rfaa	;__; Puvuruuuunu, forse gli mancano i suoi padroni, sar depresso. Oppure nn si sente bene x via del caldo che ha dovuto sopportare. Prova a coccolarlo, a giocarci e a fare amicizia e poi senti che ti dice il veterinario. Magari  solo che nn ti conosce e pensa "Dov' la mia mamma?"|`|HkpAS4ATaa	secondo me non  un grande problema,anche se ti consiglio comunque di portarlo da un veterinario.Io ho un cane di 13 anni e qualche mese fa fu operato per asportargli un tumore.nei giorni precedenti,visto che la sua situazione stava peggiorando,smise di mangiare,ma non per questo voleva farsi morire,infatti dopo l operazinoe resto comunqueper alcuni giorni senza mangiare e rinizio piano piano giorni dopo...vedi,secondo me  bene preoccuparsi quando il cane non beve,non quando non mangia,perche sarebbe sintomoche il cane voglia lasiarsi morire|`|EfVmFfbdaa	innanzittutto comincio col dirti che SEI UNA GRANDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  A UNA PERSONA COME TE,NN CI SONO CONSIGLI DA DARE!!!!!  SAPRAI SICURAMENTE COSA FARE!!!!!!  TANTO DI CAPPELLO!!!!!  sara' un po' frastornato....il vet. ti rassicurera'  UN GROSSO BACIO A TUTTI E DUE!!!!!!!!!!|`|0mce1QT6aa	sar sicuramente impaurito....!!!!!e poi deve abituarsi alla sua nuova casa ai suoi nuovi padroni....di solito quando un cane viene abbandonato i suoi occhioni sono tanto tristi....tu cerca di dare a lui tutto l'affetto e l'amore possibile e immaginabile.....cmq c' ne fossero persone intelligenti come te...hai fatto un gesto bellissimo...hai salvato e migliorato la vita ad un cucciolo...e vedrai che lui con il tempo te ne sar grato...non preoccuparti che con il tempo iniziera a mangiare e ad abituarsi alla sua nuova casa...baci e buona fortuna|`|FUYDGoaKaa	ciao,  hai fatto una cosa bellissima!!!!!ti ammiro tantissimo!!!!e hai ragione....come fanno ad abbandonarli non lo so proprio...!cmq se puoi,portarlo oggi stesso o massimo domani dal veterinario  meglio!lui ti spiegher meglio di noi...!facci sapere ;)    ciao baci Ely!*|`|Ae2jTsgiaa	Intanto complimenti. Sei proprio una bravissima persona, quelle come te le ammiro.   il cane adesso  un po' traumatizzato x via dell'abbandono, per vedrai con il tempo e con tanto amore diventer il tuo amico pi fedele.     Un'altra cosa. Anche io una volta ho trovato un cane x strada, l'ho tenuto qualcke giorno e poi sono andato da un veterinario x sapere di chi era.... e meno male che aveva il chip cos  stato possibile rintracciare il padrone.   Purtroppo non mi sembravano contenti di riavere il cagnolino..se anche tu scopri di chi per favore denuncialo.|`|3cac69a8920cd18023862b704d1c6392aa	Innanzitutto complimenti. Ti sembrer strano, ma con la mia cagnolina che aveva avuto lo stesso destino, l'ho messa sottoforma di gioco-competzione, ovvero buttavo per terra un biscotto e mi gettavo anch'io per riprenderlo prima di lei. All'inizio mi guardava come si guarda un demente, ma piano piano ha funzionato (ovviamente, la lasciavo vincere...).  Come lo chiamerai? Un abbraccio|`|2ITN8RmCaa	Portalo dal veterinaio...... Sei troppo forte. Nessuno prenderebbe un cane dalla strada... Nn ti preoccupare dagli il tempo di abituarsi... coccolalo e curalo. Per sicurezza compra un buon antipulcci e zecche.

Aej3lgQZaa	I bred them for 5 years, so will edit this to take the quiz.<br>  <br>  1) 5 according to Petsmart, 20 according to breeders.<br>  <br>  2) In dust, at least weekly, but preferably daily. More than once daily and they start to lose zeal for it, or they sleep in it or get it messy if left in the cage. Less than weekly and their fur looks terrible. <br>  <br>  3) No, that's why 80 F is uncomfortable for them, and they die at 90 F. <br>  <br>  4) Americans mostly breed them in captivity. Furriers breed them in captivity although now they are popular in the pet market as well. You want the name of the famous guy who got them from the mountains? Mr M.F. Chapman was the one who successfully domesticated the chinchilla. <br>  <br>  1) T<br>  2) T<br>  3) Maybe, but generally it is the females that spray, so I'll say False. But I bet they could if they really wanted to. They just don't. <br>  4) generally true, but depends on the chinchilla. Some like company more than others. Each has a very distinct personality, unlike most other rodents. <br>  <br>  1) hair ring<br>  <br>  2) 4. If the number is above that then I'm still right. <br>  <br>  3) 1 - 5 kits in a litter, but 1 - 3 is most common. I suppose more than 5 is possible, but more than 4 and usually the breeder has to start supplementing with a bottle.<br>  <br>  4) At least 12, but really 14 or larger is the way to go. Actually, the best thing to do is get a flying saucer wheel so you don't have to deal with the back issues from running on too small a wheel. <br>  <br>  1) C apples<br>  2) I would avoid Cedar, but Kiln dried Pine or Aspen is fine. I suppose D could be the answer, but I think that's being silly. Cedar is basically okay too. Some people are too protective. <br>  3) D. kiln dried pine is fine. As is Pear. Oak is not. Oak wood has toxic compounds, as do most single seed fruit woods. <br>  4) C. You lose 1/4 of the offspring. Homozygous black velvet is a lethal condition. <br>  <br>  I spent way too much time answering one question that could easily be googled! Why did I do this?
c2806500d8991aaac33cf04a56537d89aa	Remove as much of the urine as possible by flushing the article/area with clean water and then removing as much of it as possible with either towels of a wet-vac   Once youve removed as much urine as you are willing (or able) to, re-saturate the area with a 50/50 water/white vinegar solution and allow it to air dry (use a fan if youre in a rush).   Cover the area liberally with baking soda  use lots!   Fill a container with enough water to saturate the stained area and add a drop of regular dish detergent. Pour the solution on top of the baking soda.   Using either your hands, towels, or a scub brush, work the baking soda/water/detergent paste into the fabric  work it in good and deep, then allow it to air dry.   Once the area has dried completely and the baking soda has returned to powder form, vacuum it up. If the vacuum isnt cutting it, it can be blotted up using water and towels.   Repeat steps as needed to remove any remaining odor.|`|ksoMldqYaa	Well I had that problem and I spayed the mattress with Resolve carpet cleaner, let it soak in awhile then rubbed it into the smelly spot, I then sprinkled baking soda on the mattress and after awhile I vacuumed it off with the brush attachment.  It worked but than the mattress smelled like Resolve so I didn't make the bed for a few days letting it air out with a ceiling fan on in the room then used Febreze.  It took a few days and I had to sleep in the spare room but it was worth not having to buy a new mattress.  Good Luck and I hope whatever made kitty use your bed had been taken care of.|`|yISVgPTfaa	My cat actually just peed on my matress a few days ago. I used an all purpose cleaner with bleach and tried to soak it up with a towel as best I could. My matress still smells a bit like bleach, but thats better than cat urine. I aslo put febreeze on it to help with the bleach smell.|`|x3HWBzXXaa	Their are products at pet stores that remove urine.
wyAtVqbOaa	Pictures not that good - I know my fish are the same, ask them to stay still for photos and they swim a mile until you put the camera down - but it looks like she either may have a parasite infection and placing her into your tank has caused the infection to come out or she's cut herself on something in the tank.  <br>  <br>  Have you got something sharp eg rocks in the tank?<br>  <br>  Call the shop where you bought her from and describe what she's got and they may be able to tell you over the phone, otherwise they may ask for you to take her back for them to have a look at or get a better photograph and they will look at that.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just seen your comment about her swimming ok - if it wasn't ok you would be able to notice it as they tend to swim ok or not.|`|fZ2fwKG6aa	honestly they look fine to me! Too hard to tell by the pictures. Good Luck|`|SRs6xcxPaa	does he swim weird ?|`|45Cbtd7raa	i dont c it
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Rock and Roll Cowboy's answer is great! <br>  <br>  Reading breed descriptions is a excellent idea, so you can  learn about the general type of dispositions for which different breeds are famous and gain insight into personality.<br>  <br>  This being said, every kitten is an individual, and not every cat of a certain breed will behave exactly to the "standard." written about their behavior.<br>  <br>  Tempermant is greatly influenced by how kittens are handled when they are very young, how much time the breeder spends with them to help them bond with humans, and their unique genetic makeup.<br>  <br>  While both breeds are known for great dispositions, it is really impossible to accurately predict which will be more "laid back" and less aggressive. <br>  <br>  How you play with and demonstrate affection for your kitten however will make a huge impact on behavior.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs.|`|vzr1qfQ9aa	Ragdoll.<br>  <br>  I have a cat who is part persian and part ragdoll and he is the gooey-est animal I have ever been around. So sweet, very gentle and very laid back.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	It depends on the individual personality.  Any cat of any breed can be aggressive, the same can be said about being laid back.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	really a lot of that has to do with you and how you raise and treat them.|`|fPJJrhGhaa	ragdoll<br>  omg there so cute and hella sweet<br>  they dont bite or scratch or nothing<br>  and they like are kinda lazy ahahaha|`|JivLAZH6aa	a short hair|`|36ff857df7ec751866efe603f8e9b6aaaa	eiher|`|9kLiiDzVaa	A rag-doll

G0KKfXMUaa	2'3" means you are on your way, just not quite there yet.<br>  <br>  You are still forming a good seat, and strong jump position. Keep training and putting in effort, and you can soon be jumping about 2'9".<br>  <br>  Once you can jump that or to three foot, start riding challenging horses, and horses with more professional or extensive training.<br>  <br>  And yes, you can jump higher in the future. With the right amount of riding, and good training, you can jump six foot in the future if you wanted to =)<br>  <br>  Some good jumping tips to help you on your way-<br>  <br>  -Remember not to get ahead of the horse, or left behind.<br>  -When coming to the jump, sit deep at the canter. About two strides before the jump, slightly bend at the hip, but not fully. Once you feel the horse begin to take off, bend into full jump position (which won't be drastic considering it is not a huge jump)<br>  -While over the jump, remember to keep heels DOWN and keep the contact between your leg and the horse. Contact will help prevent your leg from sliding back.<br>  - Remember to grab the main (good for beginners at jumping) and give your horse a good release so you do not pull on his mouth.<br>  - Sit back once he lands and sit deep to regain balance.<br>  - And, always BREATH!|`|DDhsF8zYaa	2'3" is not high but it's not low.<br>  It's like, your not crawling anymore, but your not fully walking on your own yet..<br>  <br>  Great job, though! It starts getting more difficult as the pole moves up, but it gets more fun and more rewarding (:|`|oHL8qA42aa	sure, if you keep with your training, of course you will be able to jump higher.|`|GloEYJ2xaa	Yeah I see why not... Iv been riding english for only about a year now(been riding western for 8 years though) and thats without any lessons and im jumping 3 foot now and my horse isnt a former jumper either so you can go far as long as you put your mind to it and research a whole lot and get instruction....|`|GbtRPEuxaa	with instruction you will always get better and it sounds like you are doing great now<br>  height has nothing to do with ability remember you are only as good as the weaker member in a team that's you and your horse and to push a player beyond their capability could cause a wreck or even worse injury to you or you horse so do not get in a hurry jumping is far more than height its riding ability like shorting strides considering distance between jumps lengthening strides to compensate  horses style of jumping do you need to to have your rear out of the saddle for that horse to clear or is it a smooth jumper and you can stay closer so you have allot more to learn than height<br>  ok you jumper people <br>  hows that for an old cowboy<br>  and last but not least you should always thank God for a safe ride amen|`|TJKb1QDTaa	Of course you can jump higher in the future!  If your instructor tells you that you have promise, then she knows what she's talking about, and you do.  I've been riding for almost 6 years now, and I'm jumping almost 3 feet.  It will take a bit of time though.  Practice makes perfect, but to get perfect you must be patient! =]|`|RloOJ43haa	A jump of 2'3" is not all that high. However, with hard work and good instruction, I'm sure you could jump higher in the future.|`|a4MVzDwpaa	I started jumping 2'3" when i was 9, because my parents bought me a jumper pony. i am now jumping 2'9" at age 12 on the same pony. If you were comfortable, I would say it depends on what horse you are riding. I am the same type of rider. And remember. 2'3" is only 3" higher than 2'. :] think of it that way. just 3 inches!!!

zD5A9omhaa	Go up to the dog and comfort her when a man walks it. Maybe hug and stroke her and bring the man close to the dog and make him pet her. :)    Good Luck :)|`|zBolgpIYaa	Maybe it is because she thinks that you hate guys too. So, it's a sort of protection. Another reason is because she hates guys.|`|RzkX7VzIaa	Watch your dog and see if it looks like she will be aggressive.  It sounds like she needs some touch up on her socialization.  Ask men that enter your house to give her treats so that she may realize that they are not so bad.|`|189d4cb99720e07965d872dabcabad6caa	I don't believe it. A doggone Woman's lib.|`|NGEiafL8aa	easy just dont let men into your house|`|dMQWXvWCaa	I recently moved into a new apartment with my dogs. It's expected that they will bark in a new environment but the people next door complained anyway. So, my friend, who works in a vet clinic and is having a problem with the dog who lives behind her and barks all night long, purchased 2 devices that emit an ultra sonic sound everytime the dog barks. When they hear the sound the stop barking. We tried it on the barking dogs at the clinic and it worked. You can purchase one on line at petedge.com. There are 2 types, one for indoor 34 dollars and one for out door 40 dollars.  As for when you are out with her, be more aggressive with correcting her when she barks. Make her sit or lie down as the men walk by. Try to get her to pay attention to you. You can look into getting a prong collar - if used correctly which isn't difficult - they work really well and you won't have to use it for long. They do not hurt your dog. I put one on my arm to see what it felt like - it certainly gets your attention when pulled on quickly. You don't want to yank extremely hard. That can also be ordered from petedge.com. I used one of these collars to train my boston terrier to come when called and to not run out the door when it was opened, which was a big problem because she would run out into the street. I only had to use it to correct her about 3 times and I haven't had a problem since.  You can also speak with your vet. Consults should be free.

Jack Russells are known to be a bit barky and also very stubborn, so she probably gets her barking from this side of her genes. My dog is 12 now and she still does it, I think she has got a little better with age but she can still be a bit loud...I think I left it a bit late to change my dogs ways, hope you find the solution for yours.

I am not talking about any cosmetic testing.  That goes without saying.  And I am really against any mistreatment of the animals.  I have friends that work in labs, and they are very careful. <br>  <br>  But think about it.  How would I know that a drug is safe to treat an animal with, if it was not somehow tested on animals?  All testing is not in a lab, in cages with no exercise.  Sure, some is.  But there are tons of tests going on all the time.  And in a lot of these, there are animals that are cared for, and looked after by people who are close to them.  <br>  <br>  Consider some of the medications that are commonly used in both people and animals.  Like insulin, blood pressure medication, NSAID drugs.  Can you tell me that NO ONE in PETA is diabetic?  Or gets a headache?  If you can prove to me that everyone who is "against" animal testing is absolutely free of any medications, then I will keep quiet.  But I know for a fact that isn't true. <br>  <br>  I love animals.  I spend every day trying to make their life better.  But I can't help them without some help.  There are tons of ways to stop unnecessary animal testing,  by using computer programs for vivisection, but some things have to be tried on live beings.  <br>  <br>  And as far as I am concerned,  if any people want to step up to have drugs tested on them instead, go for it.|`|W0nd3qF3aa	ARE YOU SERIOUS!

EZkKZtGxaa	The green sea turtle grows to a maximum size of about 4 feet and a weight of 440 pounds. It has a heart-shaped shell, small head, and single-clawed flippers. Color is variable. Hatchlings generally have a black carapace, white plastron, and white margins on the shell and limbs. The adult carapace is smooth, keelless, and light to dark brown with dark mottling; the plastron is whitish to light yellow. Adult heads are light brown with yellow markings. Identifying characteristics include four pairs of costal scutes, none of which borders the nuchal scute, and only one pair of prefrontal scales between the eyes. Hatchling green turtles eat a variety of plants and animals, but adults feed almost exclusively on seagrasses and marine algae.<br>  <br>  <br>  The hawksbill is a small to medium-sized marine turtle having an elongated oval shell with overlapping scutes on the carapace, a relatively small head with a distinctive hawk-like beak, and flippers with two claws. General coloration is brown with numerous splashes of yellow, orange, or reddish-brown on carapace. The plastron is yellowish with black spots on the intergular and postanal scutes. Juveniles are black or very dark brown with light brown or yellow coloration on the edge of the shell, limbs, and raised ridges of the carapace. As an adult, the hawksbill may reach up to 3 feet in length and weigh up to 300 pounds, although adults more commonly average about 2? feet in length and weigh between 95 to 165 pounds. It is the only sea turtle with a combination of two pairs of prefrontal scales on the head and four pairs of costal scutes on the carapace. The hawksbill feeds primarily on sponges and is most often associated with the coral reef community.<br>  <br>  The leatherback is the largest, deepest diving, and most migratory and wide ranging of all sea turtles. The adult leatherback can reach 4 to 8 feet in length and 500 to 2000 pounds in weight. Its shell is composed of a mosaic of small bones covered by firm, rubbery skin with seven longitudinal ridges or keels. The skin is predominantly black with varying degrees of pale spotting; including a notable pink spot on the dorsal surface of the head in adults. A toothlike cusp is located on each side of the gray upper jaw; the lower jaw is hooked anteriorly. The paddle-like clawless limbs are black with white margins and pale spotting. Hatchlings are predominantly black with white flipper margins and keels on the carapace. Jellyfish are the main staple of its diet, but it is also known to feed on sea urchins, squid, crustaceans, tunicates, fish, blue-green algae, and floating seaweed.<br>  <br>  The loggerhead sea turtle is characterized by a large head with blunt jaws. The carapace and flippers are a reddish-brown color; the plastron is yellow. The carapace has five pairs of costal scutes with the first touching the nuchal scute. There are three large inframarginal scutes on each of the bridges between the plastron and carapace. Adults grow to an average weight of about 200 pounds. The species feeds on mollusks, crustaceans, fish, and other marine animals.<br>  <br>  The olive ridley sea turtle was named for the olive color of its heart-shaped shell and is one of the smallest of the sea turtles, with adults reaching 2 to 2? feet in length and weighing 80 to 110 pounds. The species may be identified by the uniquely high and variable numbers of vertebral and costal scutes. Although some individuals have only five pairs of costals, in nearly all cases some division of costal scutes occurs, so that as many as six to nine pairs may be present. In addition, the vertebral scutes also show frequent division, as do the scales on the dorsal surface of the head. The prefrontal scales, however, typically number two pairs. Existing reports suggest that the olive ridley’s diet includes crabs, shrimp, rock lobsters, jellyfish, and tunicates. In some parts of the world, algae has been reported as its principal food.

Also when did you get him?, if hes new then it could just be the *settling in phase*.|`|M3pjhIecaa	You'll often here experienced aquarists insist you add salt to your aquarium for the benefit of the mollies. Why is this?<br>  <br>  The Background<br>  <br>  The mollies you are most likely to buy at the pet store are hybrids. Black mollies, golden mollies, veiltail mollies, balloon mollies, and all the others are all hybrids created by careful cross-breeding of two or more species. Some molly species live in fresh water, while others live in brackish water. There's usually a little of both kind in any given aquarium strain.<br>  <br>  The Problem<br>  <br>  When mollies are kept in freshwater tanks, they often become sickly. Common symptoms are fin-rot, fungus, and the "shimmies". Fin-rot is a gradual decay of the fins, often with obviously dead, grey patches on the fins. Left untreated, this will kill your fish. Fungus usually looks like fine white threads and can appear anywhere on the body, though it's most common on the fins. Again, untreated, this is serious. Both fin-rot and fungus are easily treated with over-the-counter fish medicines. The shimmies are, as the name suggests, a bit like the dance of the same name. The fish seem to tread water, wobbling from side to side. Yet again, left untreated, this will kill your fish.<br>  <br>  The Solution<br>  <br>  Add marine aquarium salt mix. This will turn your tank into a slightly brackish rather than freshwater aquarium and the mollies will be much healthier. Fin-rot and fungus will not set in, and if present, should fix themselves, especially if you treat with the appropriate remedy as well. The shimmies usually go away.<br>  <br>  You don't need a lot of salt, around 3-5 grammes per litre will do the trick. Use a hydrometer to measure the specific gravity (the concentration of salt in the water). You are aiming for a specific gravity of about 1.003 to 1.005. Don't add the salt to the aquarium directly! Make up some salty water in a bucket, and then pour it into the tank. Be sure and follow the instructions on the package with regard to how long you need to stir the salt into the water for, etc.<br>  <br>  The salt doesn't just make the aquarium salty, it also raises the pH and hardness, which is just as critical for mollies.<br>  <br>  Note that table salt and aquarium tonic salt aren't acceptable alternatives. Always use marine aquarium salt. It isn't expensive, particularly not in the small amounts needed for keeping mollies.<br>  <br>  Pros & Cons of Salty Water<br>  <br>  Most other livebearers will be fine in slightly brackish water, so don't worry about things like guppies and platies. However, most freshwater fish don't like salty water, especially not things like tetras and Corydoras. Mollies basically aren't an option for aquarists wanting to keep strictly freshwater fish. On the other side of the coin, you can keep all kinds of neat brackish water fish, such as gobies, glassfish, halfbeaks, goodeids, etc., without problems.
KT0xnRGIaa	congratulations on your new kitten. Kittens need to eat often and higher protein/nutrient dense food. about a cup a day should be fine, perhaps 1/2 cup twice a day? PLEASE do not declaw your cat. it is cruel and unnecessary. the operation actually involves the amputation of the kittens first bone knuckle. it is very painful and not needed. look into plastic sheaths to put on the claws if you are concerned with scratching or damage to furniture.|`|mMcwax3Baa	Hi, I'm so glad you adopted a kitten. Cats and Kittens will only eat when hungry not like a dog. I have three babies 6 Weeks old now. I feed them enough food to last the day. When I leave in the morning, and when I come home in the evening. I make sure they have plenty of water. Oh I mix their dry food with canned, they love the wet stuff. Make sure you have a litter box that you can keep clean. Cats will not usually use a litter box when it gets full.  Most vets will declaw at 6 months some sooner the best way to know is to call your vet. As Vets have different  ways they do things. If possible do only the front paws. Cats need a way to climb out of a dangerous situation and to defend themselves if needed.|`|237f1ac86701e8329544cf520d189437aa	i HAVE ALWAYS FREE FEED Mi CATS 2 ME iT'S THE BEST THiNG BUT U CAN ONLY FREE FEED'EM W/DRY FOOD|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Firstly, a kitten needs kitten food.  Cat food comes in Kitten (under a year), Adult (1-7years) and Senior (over 7 years).  Kittens generally need small amounts often throughout the day.  They have small stomachs and their stomachs need to adjust to solid food slowly.  The back of the pack will say the quantity you should be feeding per day.  You can also buy kitten milk too whick should be on the shelf with the cat food.  It needs to be kept in the fridge after it has been opened and used within the days specified on the back.|`|eaed3d43993c66bc5a6cdef6221478a3aa	Feed according to the instructions on the bag or can of what you are offering. Twice or three times a day is good timing for a kitten of that age. The higher quality the food, the less the kitten will need, generally. Instructions are usually based on the age and weight of the kitten/cat.     Please avoid declawing. Learn to clip your kitten's nails (try a few when he's sleeping), train him not to claw inappropriately (get a spray bottle of water) and try Soft Paws (nail covers) before even thinking of declawing.
AA11577233	There are a few options.    One is that before you decorate the tree, leave it up long enough for the cats to investigate it. Once they're tired of it, then you can put the ornaments up. However, keep the breakable ones off the bottom branches.    You might also try and find cat repellant sprays in your local store or on the internet or make your own. For instance, cats hate citrus.    Good luck.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It's a fact cats will get in the Christmas tree.

I just put up a cheap tree with safe ornaments and rub some lemon juice on the light cords. I tie the tree to the ceiling so it doesn't tip. Then I sit back and watch the antics. I question how much you "love your babies" if you are willing to give them away over a Christmas tree which will be up for only a few weeks then be gone and forgotten. Loosen up.

y7H1V39Jaa	Palomino....simple as that|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	He's a palomino.  The only reason he looks so dark in the picture that he's being ridden in is because he's got that side of his body shaded from the sun.  The last two pictures are not of this horse, there is a chestnut in one of those.    FYI Calliej, a white and a gray horse are two completely different colors.  A lot of gray horses are called white when in fact they are not white (they even advertise the Lippizan's as being white but they are not, they're gray).  A white horse is born white and has pink skin.  A gray horse is born any other color (usually very dark) and lightens with age.  With age they can eventually become what looks like white, but they will always have black or very dark skin.  Notice a gray horse's hooves are black (unless they have white leg marking, then those hooves will be white like any other horse with white leg markings), as well as the muzzle, around the eyes, and genital areas will be black (anywhere that you can see the skin).  If they have white markings such as a blaze the skin will be pink under that area, just like with any other color of horse.  A true white horse is not that common.|`|govpgOhqaa	Third answerer is correct  chestnut with a flaxen main and tail.  it's NOT palomino because it has a red coat, palomino's have golden coats.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Looks like a palomino to me :-)|`|QTT9380Yaa	take a guess..?  golden palomino..|`|5M57TTfpaa	looks like a chestnut with flaxen mane and tail  http://www.icelandichorse.is/Glofext.htm...|`|aKSicRp9aa	my horse is a golden palomino, and she doesn't look the same as that horse. she is more golden, where that horse is much redder.  in my opinion that horse is a chestnut or sorrel.|`|iynxbd9Daa	chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail|`|psNR7hDJaa	I think either golden palomino or maybe a type of chestnut|`|eX8i4vwRaa	thats what i would say too.  he is super gorgeous!  ?|`|T0pkW783aa	Golden palimino (not the lighter one but the more golden color)  Very nice!!

lyhnHhuWaa	The big clumps are pee, not poop.  It's really not as much as it seems, but the litter absorbs all of it so it looks like a huge clump.    I have five cats and three large boxes... two covered and one open.  I've found that some cats prefer open boxes and others prefer covered ones so I like to make sure they each have what they prefer.  If you have an open box, make sure it's nice and deep and that will cut down on the amount of litter they sling out when they scratch.  I scoop the boxes a minimum of 2-3 times daily.  In the morning, when I get home from work and before bedtime.  I use small disposable trash bags or shopping bags when I scoop, then throw those into a covered/lined trash can outside that I empty weekly.    When the level of litter looks low in the boxes, I replenish it so the sides and bottom don't start getting soaked.  About once every 1.5 - 2 weeks, I empty all of the litter, clean the boxes and put in fresh litter.  One thing I've found that makes cleanup easier is to line the bottom of the pan with folded newspaper.  That keeps litter from becoming pasted onto the bottom of the pan.  I also recommend unscented litter.  You can mix a little baking soda with it to keep the odor down.  The scented litters are usually pretty overpowering and don't do much to mask litter box odors.  I certainly wouldn't want to scratch around in them while in an enclosed box, so I don't subject my cats to the overwhelming smell.  Regular scooping and cleaning of the boxes will keep things clean enough and will control odors.|`|P1SfKSNBaa	I clean my box daily and have one cat. I was reading that you should have a litter box for each cat plus one.|`|yv4zBWZzaa	as soon as possible because cats are very finicky and prefer a clean environment to be in, and if you cant get to it as soon as possible, just try not to let it get to filthy or it will be hard to clean up.|`|fqKmsqsZaa	I clean mine out as often as I can. On good days, I clean it once they have just used it. :))|`|EkpG9jbbaa	I have one cat, siamese and this cat is a very upright cat... she will not go to the litter box if it smells, thats that, she will be meowing all day if she have to, just to make me clean it up! I clean that thing twice a week, and put ORGANIC sand on it... with a deodoriser of your choice... your cat will do his/her bussiness there no problem. But try and clean it at least twice a week... cat's are very strange creatures... they like to be clean and have their thing cleaned up and ready to use when they want to use them.  |`|AA12380746	it depends on the cat... I used to scoop it out as soon as i saw it in the box. but then my cat quit using it... so now I scoop it once a day and she seems to be happy with that... funny little thing.    and you should have 5 liter boxes one for each cat plus one.|`|4TX26viFaa	LOL!    You'll notice a huge difference with 4 cats that would not be there with three.  Four seems to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.    Scoop any time you see the surface disturbed--take the wet as well as the poop, to eliminate as much of the urine ammonia odor as possible.  Don't put it into the kitchen garbage, put it into a bag to be emptied out every evening.  I save old cat food bags, the plastic inside liners make sure the bottom won't disintegrate if it gets too moist.  Just dump what's in the bag once a day and you'll keep a lot of smells down inside the house.    I fill the box with about 3" of litter.  By the end of the week we're down to maybe 1/2". Smell it, if it has an ammonia odor, dump what's left and start new again.  If it seems ok, fill more clean on top of it.      We have one box and had as many as 5 cats for a long while. I'd be making sure it was scooped in the morning when I got up. Once when I got home from work, once about 8pm and took a look at it again just before bedtime.  I think I devoted a grand total of 45 seconds a day to scooping--it's not time consuming at all.    Ours were fine with one box between them. We lost two last year (cancer and a heart problem) so are down to three, and I still follow with the same proceedure.    If you maintain three boxes, still do this every day, it'll give you clean boxes the cats will want to use.|`|2iqBP8cLaa	I have 8 cats, 1 foster and 4 very large litter boxes that I clean twice a day.

You can pick out the poo's maybe for a day but when the bottom has alot of pee in it you need to change it pronto.    Their poo's can seem bigger than necessary eh.  :)      You need to keep their litter boxes clean or they will look elsewhere for a clean pleasant place to do their business.....|`|U1TAHDlcaa	You clean it out once a day.

4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Yes, guinea pigs eat all the time. They must have food flowing through the digestive tract at a constant rate. They just graze all day. This is healthy and normal. They should have hay and water available at all times, in addition to a cup of fresh veggies per pig per day. Pellets should be fed morning & night.    Fresh grass is fine for your piggies, but be sure the grass has not been treated with any pesticides or fertiliser. Also, be sure the grass is clean and has not been soiled by other animals (dogs, deer, etc.).    The purring or rumbling sound is usually associated with dominance or mating. With male and female combinations, the male will make this sound to indicate that he wants to mate with the female. With same sex combinations, this sound is made at times while dominance is being established. Dominance issues can also include teeth chattering.|`|xowm9t3kaa	guinea pigs love to eat I had one she was really sweet. the purring sound i believe is a sound of happiness.|`|wDhtB2Puaa	well i had a guinea pig when i was younger and i remember that he always ate...like always. i thought it was normal. so im not that sure but my pig was like that too.

It also means calm and relaxed. Gunie pigs LOVE food, and they do want to eat all the time, so i would just look that up in a book at the library. Just do it k?

BEvzXXVfaa	We have break way (safety) collars on both of our inside cats.  They were both annoyed when I first put it on them, but they are used to them.

But, she look so cute with pink with black paws!.

zCCQgxtVaa	olha leia por favor estas respostas. O se humano tem a mania de destriur tudo que n?o consegue dominar ou entender...  Que raiva da mdia...  PS  a mesma resposta que dei a outra pergunta parecida.    Para quem n?o leu a revista Pet World que fala sobre o assunto leia  muito importante que vejam o que o homem faz com estes animais  inacreditvel a maldade, deixam eles sem gua d?o S____e para eles beberem para gostarem de destruir. Isto  humano onde?    Para adquirir um animal deste precisa ter personalidade e personalidade forte, n?o  para qualquer um,  um animal forte, dominante, cuida de seus donos e de seu territrio como ningum, mas infelizmente comete falhas, e no nosso mundinho medocre ele  sacrificado por isso, e o dono dele???????? Ningum sabe, ningum viu. O cachorro que  louco. Parece charge :  "Inclusive eu escutei que estes c?es est?o fazendo reuni?es secretas para dominar o mundo e morder criancinhas, tomem cuidado" - sem comentrios.    Engra?ado n?o conhe?o nenhum Pit Bull que criou armas de destrui??o em massa como as biolgicas , ou armas at?micas, ou que esta mudando o clima do planeta porque ele  um gnio procriador que n?o sabe votar. N?o depende de nada nem de ningum e nunca ERRA, vai comer computador e respirar chip quando conseguir eliminar os alimentos e o oxignio do planeta.    Desculpe pessoal estou realmente irritada com isto, a quinze dias salvei uma cachorra desta ra?a ela estava em um estado terminal, estava com um corte gigante no pesco?o cheio de infec??es e as pessoas ainda estavam batendo nela.   E ainda me dizem que o ser humano  o nico ser que entende o significado de compaix?o??????  Quem salvou o animal a polcia militar, pessoas maravilhosas, homens de bem. Que trabalham duro ganham pouco e s tomam pedradas. Quem quiser ver a histria todo veja o site abaixo. e assista o programa Late show aos domingos para ver o que o homem pode fazer com os bichos, porque s?o superiores.  Desculpe gente, estou furiosa com a mdia.  Eu fico profundamente triste pelos acidentes e incidentes que aconteceram.|`|41JsXn92aa	E desde quando s "cachorro bonito" deve ser permitido viver? Ent?o vamos come?ar exterminando todos os poodles da face da terra, que alm de serem feios e histricos para burro, atacam muito mais que PB's. E desculpa, pitbull nem  minha ra?a preferida (gosto mais de pug, pembroke corgi e papillon), mas os considero muito fofos, teis e emocionalmente estveis. Os feios ou violentos s?o aqueles completamente fora do padr?o.    Estatisticamente (isso dito por operadoras de seguros), o pit bull entre outras 100 ra?as de cachorros  a stima ra?a de BAIXO PARA CIMA cima na lista das que mais atacam. Os c?es que mais provocam acidentes e ataques s?o cockers, labradores, poodles, etc. E isso proporcionalmente, ent?o n?o me venham com "ah,  pq tem menos/mais". Ent?o, esse preconceito TOLO de gente que nunca brincou com um  t?o ingnuo e desinformado que fica engra?ado. Pena que esse preconceito s vezes passa a barreira da "gra?a" e pode chegar  atividade criminosa. Para quem n?o sabe, o cachorro considerado mais adestrado da amrica latina (considerado por muitos como o mais obediente do mundo) era um pitbull brasileiro que morreu envenenado por um desocupado ignorante.    Agora vc veja, vc n?o ficaria violento se te espancassem todo dia, deixassem vc no sol amarrado sem gua e comida, etc? Pois ,  o que pessoas que treinam pitbulls para briga fazem. E mesmo sendo torturados diariamente para se tornarem vioentos, eles normalmente n?o atacam pessoas. Acredito que ningum aqui j viu c?es em ring, mas os treinadores e juzes puxam os cachorros pelo rabo, batem na cabe?a deles sem prote??o, etc, e mesmo assim eles n?o atacam essas pessoas. Aposto que isso  mais controle do que eu mesma teria sendo criada nessas condi??es.    Em resumo, dificilmente um pitbull ataca um ser humano, ele foi geneticamente selecionado para N?O atacar pessoas (justamente por causa dos juzes no ring), por isso que os ataques s?o raros (apesar dos poucos casos serem muito divulgados na mdia, o que faz parecer que sejam t?o perigosos). Aposto aqui que ningum ouviu falar da mulher que teve o rosto TODO arrancado por UMA mordida de labrador enquanto estava deitada no sof, certo? Achei muito interessante que nos poucos sites de notcias que publicaram o fato, a maioria n?o citou a ra?a. Ent?o sa pesquisando, pesquisando e.... descobri que foi um labrador, por isso que a ra?a n?o era citada. ;) Ela ficou totalmente sem rosto e faz pouco tempo sofreu uma opera??o considerada a maior opera??o plstica de regenera??o facial ocorrida no mundo. O ataque ocorreu porque o cachorro ficou apavorado achando que a dona estava morrendo (ela tinha tomado remdios para dormir). Tpica coisa que um pitbull jamais faria porque eles s?o emocionalmente muito mais estveis.    O problema n?o s?o os c?es, e sim os donos. Esses devem ser processados em caso de negligncia. O Brasil  um estado de direito e n?o pune sem que haja crime ou dano. Ou devemos proibir carros na rua j que s?o os maiores responsveis pela morte de jovens no Brasil?    Proibir UMA ra?a de cachorro n?o resolveria o problema, porque eles simplesmente comprariam um doberman, rottweiler, dogo argentino, etc. Da aconteceria como ocorreu em algumas cidades dos EUA onde se proibiu e sacrificou um MONTE de ra?a de cachorro. Quem disse que seu c?o tb n?o acabaria numa lista para ser sacrificado? Ent?o cuidado, pq os nossos direitos tb dependem da prote??o dos direitos dos outros. Deixar que o direito dos outros seja atacado  pedir para que nossos direitos futuramente tb sejam.    Ah, e para quem est se perguntando qual a utilidade de um c?o como esse, eu diria more sozinho por umas semanas em uma casa num lugar como Santa Tereza. Logo vc vai perceber que  necessrio sim um pitbull, rottweiler, etc, ou sua casa ser invadida todo dia por vagabundo querendo te roubar/matar/estuprar.    E para os que dizem "ah, mas este  um c?o criado pelos homens para ser violento, n?o far falta para a natureza se exterminarmos a ra?a atravs de castra??o": n?o se esque?am que a MAIORIA das ra?as de c?es domsticos hoje foram criadas pelo homens. Algumas s?o mais novas, outras mais antigas, mas "cachorro selvagem" mesmo  lobo. O resto  sele??o humana. Ou vc acha que na natureza um poodle ou pequins teriam chance de sobrevivncia? Voc esbarra em pastor alem?o e cocker em floresta? Todos criados em "laboratrio" como foi dito por outro usurio, e nem por isso devemos extermin-los. E s para demonstrar que c?o violento  reflexo de sua educa??o, para quem n?o sabe rottweiler  um c?o "criado em laboratrio" para ser pastor. Ele  um c?o pastor, ent?o, se tivermos que exterminar "c?o com potencial de perigo", pastores tb ir?o morrer. Porque se a discuss?o for sobre "utilidade", qualquer pitbull  mais "til" em regi?o urbana que um beagle, pequins ou pastor.  E quem conhece c?es sabe muito bem que  MUITO comum pastores alem?es ficarem EXTREMAMENTE violentos em idade avan?ada (por loucura mesmo, que  muito comum na ra?a, atacam qualquer um, dono ou n?o, ficam mordendo grades de jaulas at a boca se rasgar, etc). Quem quer essa matan?a? Seria um bola de neve que poderia matar o SEU c?o.|`|dpUyPl95aa	Eu com certeza sou a favor da ra?a pit bull, porque,  claro que a ra?a j tem uma tendncia, porm  o dono que faz com que seu animal fique bravo.

fGeABqhdaa	My dog does that all the time. It might be because of something he's smelling or some spilled food. Or if you've just washed the blanket, dogs tend to like to put their scent on everything. Hope this helps.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	My dog does that to the couch.  I think he smells something we spilled on it, like food.
lyhnHhuWaa	You can try Feliway diffusers or spray.  They contain pheromones that are sometimes calming to anxious cats.  One of mine grooms excessively as a result of anxiety, and I didn't have much luck with the Feliway but it's at least worth a shot.  If the vet has ruled out all other causes and the Feliway doesn't work, I recommend speaking with your vet about the possibility of giving her anti-anxiety medication.  My excessive grooming cat has been on Amitriptyline for some time now and it has worked wonders for her.  She was almost entirely bald by the time she started on it.  All of her fur has since grown back and she's back to being her old self.  She's much more engaged and obviously less anxious than she was before.  It's definitely made her a much happier cat.  I haven't noticed any side effects and the cost of the medication is low ($7.95 for a 60 day supply).  If all else fails, I wouldn't rule out the possiblity of medicaton therapy.|`|cj31x3UMaa	rrm38 suggested 2 things that might work.    Over grooming can be caused by stress, hormones or diet.    Has she been spayed? This would take care of hormones.    There was a fantastic food I found years ago from Canada that stopped several cats I had from bored over grooming, unfortunately it got hard to find & I have forgotten the name. HOWEVER - it was low on things like corn & high on meats & other natural ingredients - so experimenting w/ diet might help a little. Avoid corn & fish as those are major allergens.|`|P1SfKSNBaa	i agree with the Feliway diffusers idea. Every time I go to my vet I see one plugged in and it seems to calm my cat.|`|4TX26viFaa	The Feliway or Bach's Rescue Remedy can work wonders.    Check around online for the Feliway, prices can be up to double for the same size bottle.|`|c5d771b4a5fe3772df346e3ce4f775d2aa	you may have to actually get some medication to calm her down.  My cousin had a cat that licked his belly bare also.  The vet also told her it was a nervous condition.  It caused him a lot of problems with hairballs.  |`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Cat Nip.  Does wonders.  
q0Dg8a1haa	Most will cost around 5-15 dollars at any store. Oh, and I advise you get 2, they are social and will keep each other company when you're at work or school :)|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Jack's sounds like a store known only in your area and most people here wouldn't know anything about it.   You can either re-post your questions under "Local Businesses" or simply call the store.|`|IFGSOd16aa	i got a baby rat for 4 dollars at petsmart|`|4hSE7pu1aa	probably bout 5-25 buks|`|GuOJIftAaa	Oh please don't by from Jack's. They keep the boys and girls together so you have a risk of buying a pregnant female and ending up with 12+ babies. They're not in the greatest of conditions. And the rats are aloud to breed uncontrollably, with siblings and parent rats.  I got two brother rats there and I ended up having to spend upwards of $300 because one got so sick within two days of me buying him with a brain tumor and a cyst behind his eye with a respiratory infection and he ended up passing away anyways. When I got him he looked and sounded perfectly fine. They don't handle any of their rats there and they aren't socialized at all. But, if that's your only option then just be careful. People at pet stores are usually really undereducated on the animals. You MUST get two or more rats or they will be depressed. They need a large wire cage, not an aquarium. And no wood chip bedding, that causes respiratory issues.     Go to goosemoose.com for any more questions. They are very educated, friendly and ready to help out.
bVLwH4jlaa	The "chew toy" bit is very worrying. It sounds like they are turned out on poor conditions.    If you must bag your horse's tail, forget about buying a wrap. Take some of your old clothes, especially stretch fabric items, to the farm with scissors and a sewing kit. Get creative!    A time consuming but effective cure for tail chewing, if your horse must be in that herd, is to smear a bit of tinned dog or cat food throughout the tail or on the tail wrap. That must be cleaned out at least twice daily and re-applied.    I would consider checking into other local stables for a move if I were you. If they are tail chewing then there must be a lack of quality somewhere, whether it is related to nutrition, space, or other quality factors.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I think they only come in lycra bags or cotton/lycra braid type.  Only other ones I have seen are short plastic one that you stuff the tail in.  You can try a panyhose leg or a single nylon, don't know what would happen if a horse ate it tho.  You can spray some bitters on it.|`|43jVgsaBaa	go to ebay, they have everything!!!|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I used to use two pair of pantyhose for my tail bags.  Use 3 legs to divide the hair into, lay the fourth on your shoulder for later.  Divide the tail into 3 parts, put each part into one leg of the panty hose...(wet it and it will drop in, no trouble).  When you get the braid completed, use the fourth to tie it off.  It stays put, it breaths so that you can actually wash the tail without taking it down, it costs nothing and you can add on either other panty hose or long rags to be used for swishing the flies.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	The best thing would be to spray the tail in something bitter, such as fly spray or stuff that you put on finger nails to stop biting them.  Another thing would be to wipe neat lemon juice all over it - from the bottle.    We used to have this problem when I worked in Germany with young-stock.  The problem with putting anything on the tail, such as bandages is that they can tighten in the rain, slip and break the hairs  or somehow get into a muddle which can damage the tail bone or its blood vessels.    Have just looked up tailgator.co.uk.  That looks quite good.  It costs around 16.99 depending on the length of your horse's tail.|`|AA12038878	This time of year horses will chew tails/rugs/fences etc because there isn't much for them to eat when they are turned out & they are bored!  Try putting hay out in lots of little piles as this will give the horses something to do.  You could also try things like horse toys & footballs in the the field - if the horses are occupied they won't chew!  Get some anti-cribbitting spray and put some on the tail away from the dock as this will put the others off chewing.    In my experience if you over use tail bags & tail bandages you end up with a rather sparse, thin tail as it will damage the tail if you use it every day - it would be better & probably more comfortable for your horse to find a way of stopping the others from chewing instead of using a tail bag.  Tail bags are really only meant to be used just after you have washed the tail until you go in to your competition at a show, not for every day use.    If you really want a tail bag, this one would probably do the job & is sensibly priced!   http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/RIFF-RAFF-NEOPRENE...

Allergies or mange could also be at fault.  DO NOT put neosporin or anything else on them until you know what they are!  Have a vet do a skin scraping to find out what it is.  His treatment could be anything from anti-fungal cream, medicated shampoo, or oral antibiotics- I'm a groomer and I see dozens of scabby dogs for different reasons, and if you don't find the right treatment it won't clear up, and it could get worse.  Please, seek professional help on this one!|`|MbEUwtlNaa	Does he have fleas? Fleas could possibley be biting his belly & argrivating his skin to where he digs at himself|`|fLWKlPINaa	it could be an alergy to somthing or he might have been stuck ect. when he is outside what what he does to see, it he isn't cutting himself then it could be an alergy and need treatment. ask your vet!|`|rUCyCEzEaa	probably allergies|`|TlCsqa1Zaa	My dog, Duke, had scabs on his belly, and chest.  I took him to the vet, and it turn out to be a bacterial infection he got from scratching a flea, or a bug bite.  Just like humans if we scratch a area to much it can become infected.  Duke was given an antibiotic, and it healed within 3 days.|`|RKT9STNkaa	It could be a skin disease of any kind.  You need to take him to the vet asap, and let him look at it.  The vet may or may not order some lab work on your pup to find out what type of infection it is.  Most likely it is something that a weeks worth of antibiotics will clear up.
gFS0NX8uaa	Primero ke nada debes hacer algo respecto a las pulgas por ke puede pegarselas a la mayor ok.  al parecer ya tenias  a la mayor y llego la nueva, son animales territoriales, asi ke si es posible no hagas ke convivan si no lo desean ellas, no las alimentes en el mismo traste ni les des en el mismo recipiente la leche, tienes ke tenerles el lugar para descansar separados y si tienes caja de arena tmb separalas.  Si alguna ves observas k conviven bien premialas, eso marcara un comportamiento positivo, y con el tiempo entenderan, recuerda ke una es mayor solo kiere comer y descansar y la otra peke?a kiere jugar, aprender, y demas, asi ke si la mayor no le tiene paciencia, no puedes hacer nada, excepto esperar a ke crezca la menor.|`|miyQcyJFaa	Mira haz esto unas varias vecez.

Al principio pelearan y no debes rega?arlas, sino llamar a la gata adulta con voz tranquila pero firme, si no se separan entonces si alzas un poquito la voz pero jamas gritar y tener mucha paciencia, no alterarte, por que les transmites tu nerviosismo y resulta peor.

fda66a3825ca9cdd945fd0f771540bddaa	She's needling.  She's mimicking the action she used to do when she was a kitten to stimulate her mother to produce milk.  It's a sign that she's happy and comfortable and feels at home with her surrogate mother - you.  Some cats even drool at the same time, in anticipation of the milk that is supposed to flow.|`|c5d771b4a5fe3772df346e3ce4f775d2aa	Most all cats do it.  My mother calls it "making biscuits".

Mine does this too. I think the are just kneading it as if to see if it is comfortable enough. |`|b84b5e5d75741ed7416489b8f2037924aa	This action is called 'treading' and it is what she used to do as a kitten when suckling milk from her mother, treading on her mothers tummy to stimulate the milk.    Cats do this when they are older as it is a comfort thing and is relaxing, it takes them back to the feeling of security and comfort they had with their mother.      Our cats do this all the time, if they are trying to get comfy before settling down, or just on your lap for a cuddle.|`|HyBJwA6uaa	That loud purring followed by the sharpening of claws on some soft spot of your body is called "milk-treading." When you relax and sit quietly, you're giving your cat the same signal he got from his mother when he was a kitten - that his mother was ready to let him suckle. A nursing kitten instinctively uses his paws to draw out the milk, gently pushing on his mother's stomach to increase the milk flow. When older cats behave this way, it's a good sign that they're happy, content, and probably recalling their kittenhood.  |`|7d0d302bef52f1187580c3d6f022e46aaa	My cat does this all the time.

I give my girls shredded paper for their bed & they are always chewing it it aids digestion but not too much.  If it's chewing they need I would give them half a raw swede it wears their teeth down.

u61yKsE3aa	The answer is yes.  However the common cold is not passed person to cat.  However if You are a bird owner all respiratory infections can spread to them.  With cats though most aliments you will get will not effect him.  He might just be picking up on your discomfort.|`|BOHi9zfcaa	Animals tend to have a stronger immune system...my dog hasn't been sick since we got her and she's nearly 3 now|`|b8yhcxmRaa	It is not very common, but trans-species infections from humans to animals is not something unheard of either.  Latest research indicated that retroviruses are the most common in human-to-animal transmission.  Keep in mind, that due to species differences, the immune response could be different; it is not necessary for animals to exhibit the same symptoms as humans, but you could tell they are not feeling well.

However, I was surprised to have recently read that Salmonella can be passed from humans to animals.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, although the number of diseases that can be transmitted between people and cats (in either direction) is much, much smaller than the number that can be transmitted from person to person or from cat to cat.  I doubt that a cat could catch a cold from a person, because there are rather few viruses that can infect both people and cats.
sj5KT3ZDaa	You have to make sure that she is not licking the incision.  When she messes with it, she is removing the sutures and opening the incision, or she could cause the area to get infected. It will get red, swollen or have discharge.  When this happens, then you should take her to get some antibiotics...   If she had come back already, then the vet should have considered giving u guys an e-collar already to prevent this.|`|wzuDxwXdaa	i dont think its normal take her to the doctor and say it keeps coming back can you do something.|`|5e8edf0a735d4a19dc02b2011ab01c3eaa	i would take her to a new vet to get another opinon|`|fuNpfyVBaa	This is really a question for your vet.

mZv92E7Caa	what 'chemo' did he have, when did it stop, and what meds is he on?    the worst part right now is probably getting over the 'addisonian crisis', from the lysodren. after his steroid levels get back to normal, and his body recuperates, he should be just fine. this is a difficult period right now, but his behgavior shouldn't last for more than a few days after stopping lysodren and starting prednisone. sounds like you've already learned this though. does your vet know about these odd behaviors? given the timeframes, it doesn't sound like normal recovery to me. if it continues- he may need to be hospitalized for a couple days. not saying that your vet isn't great, but you can always get a second opinion if that would make you more comfortable. it sounds like you've already learned most of those things....    as for experiences, i've personally known a few dozen cushingoid dogs that are very happy and pretty normal. i've seen 4 go through the addisonian crisis. it can be pretty scary and life threatening. all 4 were hospitalized and were doing fine after about a week. some will need prednisone for life, won't, some will need more lysodren; it depends on how much damage was done to the adrenals.   i hope this helped. good luck with your pup!|`|13KBWzBXaa	Poor doggie!    http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/...    in canines:  http://www.kateconnick.com/library/cushi...
UFtbZcdraa	Lovebirds are actually very hardy and easy to keep.  They don't die easily.  Ours are fed seeds, pellet, sprouts and veggies.  Though he's not crazy about veggies.  We only have one and he's very close to us, he thinks we're part of his flock.  He takes naps in our palms and sings on our shoulders.  It's very important to teach them the "step up" commend so they know you're the leader.  His wings are clipped and travels in the car with us.  Lovebirds are absolute delights to have around.|`|UMylG80waa	The first thing to consider in taking care of your lovebird is diet. In the wild, lovebirds eat a large variety of foods including vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, seeds,  and sometimes even worms and carrion.  So in keeping with their preferred natural diet you would try and mimic those things at home.  Now we all realize that in the wild birds normally get tons more exercises than they do in the cage so the amount of high-fat foods we feed need to be limited.  An all anything diet needs to be avoided at all costs.  In the past everyone pretty much thought that a bag of seed was needed to keep birds happy.  This is a dangerous way of thinking.  All seed diets can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, multiple nutritional deficits and can cause your bird to be less resistant to disease and even cancer!   A well rounded diet is needed for to keep your lovebird healthy and happy.  Feed a diet of fresh vegetables, pellets,  nuts, grains, proteins, such as eggs or cooked meat and pastas, cooked, everyday.  Fruits should be reserved for treats once or twice a week.  Seeds are necessary for nutrients in their diets so you should feed seeds daily but in small amounts.  Your lovebird can eat pretty much everything you do with the exception of avocado, rhubarb, chocolate, caffeine or raw milk products.  There are some lively debates about what not to feed your birds a standard rule would be if its bad for you, its bad for them.    Many lovebird owners cook for their birds and I cook for mine.  Birdy bread is a great way to hide  vegetables that some of the more stubborn birds will not touch.  There are plenty of birdy bread recipes out there, check em out!       Cage size is very important.  Your lovebird needs to be able to stretch and flap his wings without hitting the sides of the cage or any toys.  There are many cages out there and its always best to get the largest cage you can afford for your bird. There are things to consider as well such as bar spacing.  Bar spacing is very important because bar spacings to wide may cause injury to your bird as their heads can get stuck in between the bars. Birds love to climb so it makes sense that horizontal cage bars are the most desirable for the cage.  Preferable at least two walls should be horizontal to allow play, climbing and hanging time for your bird.   Check welding spots when looking at cages. Make sure they are free from gaps and sharp points, birds can and will get stuck in gaps and can get seriously injured by losing toes to cracks in the cage. So be sure and look for areas where your bird could hurt itself.  Perches are the next thing in line with the cage designs.  Many cages come with wooden dowels as perches.  Natural wood perches are great and its important to remember that your bird will need different size perches to provide foot excerise and prevent foot sores or arthritis in your pet bird.   Cage placement is important your lovebird needs sunshine in order to process vitamin D which is essential in calcium absorption.  Place a cage near a window if at all possible but far enough back so that a draft from the window can't get in the birds cage.  A draft can be as deadly to a lovebird as a predator.  Lovebirds require at minimum ten hours of sleep time.  This is accomplished by covering your cage for that amount of time or keeping their room dark.  Lovebirds are so playfully and as  in their nature they need plenty of toys to keep them busy while they are in their cages.  Rotate toys out once a month to prevent boredom as well as toy bonding.  Many toys have mirrors on them and if you want to provide your bird a mirror toy then be aware they more than likely will bond with the bird in the  mirror and not you.  Mirrors however are a personal choice and many do use them with no issues.  Many bored birds become feather pluckers and will pick out their own feathers in frustration and boredom.  Toy rotation again is a good way to help prevent this from happening.|`|372c59c92de767dab227320eb8deca50aa	If you want your birds to grow more attached to to you it is a good idea to keep them apart for a while. Put them together again only after they are bond to you.    If they bond to each other they won't ever be that much interested in humans.|`|NuurUc8Waa	Most lovebirds love a bath either in a flat earthenware dish or by spraying them with a light mist of lukewarm water. If you use a bathing dish, you will see the birds perch on the edge and dip their heads and upper bodies in the water and beating their wings. They prefer this kind of bath to getting into the water.    Lovebirds generally maintain their nails and beaks on their own through climbing and chewing. Another good use they make of their tree branches.In the wild, lovebirds feed on seeds, berries, fruits, grains, grasses, leaf buds, and agricultural crops of corn, maize and figs.    Foods available for Lovebirds include formulated diets, either pelleted or extruded, seed only diets, and small parrot mixes which offer a mixture of both. There are pros and cons to feeding only a formulated diet as well as feeding only a seed diet. A formulated diet provides a good nutritional base so does not require the addition of vitamins, however many parrots become bored with it due to the lack of variety. A seed only diet offers much more variety but requires additional vitamin and calcium supplements. Lovebirds need not only nutritional requirements met but also variety for psychological enrichment.
MLBCJvKUaa	los pelos no son el problema, si no los parsitos toxoplasma gondii, que el gato elimina en las fecas, que al contagiarse al humano se produce la enfermedad toxoplasmosis, produciendo da?o severo al ni?o que est por nacer, sin embargo si la persona no est embarazada, los sntomas son leves, casi como una gripe.    Si una mujer se infecta durante el embarazo, su hijo que an no ha nacido tambin puede infectarse. Los bebs infectados pueden no desarrollar ninguna enfermedad, o pueden ponerse muy enfermos, y tener lesiones graves en el cerebro y en los ojos    el contagio se produce al manipular la caja sanitaria de un gato, pero tambin se puede adquirir al consumir carne que no est bien cocida.    ac te dejo algunos datos, que consegu de esta pgina:    http://familydoctor.org/online/famdoces/...        Cmo puedo evitar el toxoplasma durante el embarazo?    consejos que le ayudarn a evitar exponerse al toxoplasma durante el embarazo:    No permita que su gato salga afuera de su casa a lugares donde pueda entrar en contacto con el toxoplasma. Si es posible, haga que alguien ms cuide de su gato mientras usted est embarazada.     Haga que otro miembro de su familia limpie la caja donde el gato defeca y luego desinfctela con agua hirviendo durante cinco minutos.     Si usted tiene que encargarse del oficio de limpiar la caja donde el gato defeca use guantes de hule (caucho) para evitar entrar en contacto con la materia fecal y despus lvese las manos cuidadosamente.     Use guantes de trabajo cuando trabaje en el jardn y lvese las manos despus de terminar. Cubra las cajas con arena de los ni?os cuando no las estn usando pues a los gatos les gusta usarlas como cajas para defecar.     Tanto como le sea posible controle las pulgas y las cucarachas. stas pueden trasmitirle a la comida tierra o materia fecal de gato contaminada.     Evite comer carne o ave cruda o poco cocinada y frutas o vegetales sin lavar.     Lvese las manos cuidadosamente antes de comer y despus de entrar en contacto con carne cruda, tierra, arena o gatos.     Evite frotarse los ojos o la cara al preparar comida y limpie la superficie donde trabaj cuando termine.

La enfermedad es considerada una zoonosis, es decir, existe normalmente en otros animales, pero puede ser transmitida a seres humanos. De hecho, los hospedadores definitivos son los miembros de la familia Felidae; y de sta, slo en 2 gneros que incluyen 7 especies, entre ellas el gato (Felis catus, Felis domestica).[2]    La fuente de infeccin ms frecuente son los animales domsticos, aunque el parsito se encuentra en variadas especies de animales silvestres. La forma ms comn de infeccin es el hospedador definitivo, los gatos infectados, aunque puede provenir tambin de huspedes intermedios, como los perros, conejos, cerdos[8] (la salchicha de cerdo, probablemente debido a su preparacin, no tiende a ser una fuente de importancia para la transmisin de toxoplasmosis),[9] ratas, ratones, ganado vacuno,[10] palomas y otras aves domsticas. Otras fuentes de infeccin son la leche de cabra, huevos crudos, insectos como la mosca y la cucaracha que pueden cargar los ooquistes desde las heces de los gatos.  Adems de la fuente de infeccin primaria, que son las heces del gato como husped definitivo, la infeccin en humanos puede que provenga de la ingestin de carne cruda, mal cocida o la manipulacin de estos alimentos (aunque luego se cocinen muy bien) por contaminacin de las manos, utensilios de cocina, etc. Se sabe que el parsito cruza la placenta pudiendo transmitirse al feto, si la madre se infecta por primera vez durante el embarazo.[7] Cerca del 40% de los recin nacidos de madres con toxoplasmosis aguda sern infectados[11] -aproximadamente 2 de cada 1000 bebs en los Estados Unidos, por ejemplo. Si la infeccin ocurri antes de quedar embarazada, el nuevo beb no puede ser infectado. El riesgo es menor si la infeccin ocurri en las ltimas semanas de gestacin.[7] Con muchsima menos frecuencia, el parsito puede ser transmitida por transfusin de sangre, o trasplante de rganos.|`|ubWcxuofaa	Especialmente los de gato, porque trasmiten la toxoplasmosis, y es muy peligroso para cualquier embarazada, ya que el bebe no tiene tan desarrollado el sistema inmunologico como los adultos.

A ball python would be an excellent next step, but a GTP would be skipping about 5 steps, lol.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	If you have the experience and housing and time to put into it, get a green tree python.

They are rather difficult to keep correctly and can be sensitive to improper husbandry. Selling points for GTBs run along the lines of "little nipper, face striker, etc". These are not snakes that you handle.    A ball python could be your next step. You could also look into redtail boas or possibly a white-lipped python, though with only corn snake experience I'd honestly reccomend a ball or childrens python, possibly a king.|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	I would say get the Ball Python for now. I have a corn too and I am getting a ball python soon. After you have your bp for a while then I would suggest getting the Green Tree Python.|`|nmzpdvkqaa	if all you owned was a corn snake, then get a ball python. gtps are alot more aggressive and way harder to care for and get stessed out easy, you need alot of time to spend with them to keep them calm.  if you get a ball python and you fell like you need somthing a bit more different do research on a carpet python.|`|q5Tc9wziaa	If you're fully capable of keeping both, then if I were you, I would get the Green Tree Python. I think that the Green Tree pythons are beautiful!!|`|Syrlo7a1aa	ummm. Ball Python. You are still kinda a beginner once you think you can go higher afetr a ball python, you can go to maybe a blood python, and then once you are more experienced you can maybe get a GTP|`|CUFnorZyaa	If you are capable and knowledgeable I'd say go with the GTP. Assuming of course you have the proper housing. Beautiful animals.|`|AA10049109	Comparing a green tree python to a cornsnake is like comparing a chevy to a Ferrari.  Comparing a ball python to a GTP is the same.  While ball pythons require a bit more husbandry than a cornsnake, they are still what are considered beginner snakes.  That said, if you've done all the research, checked into getting Greg Maxwell's book: The More Complete Chondro for reference, then you could keep a chondro.  They are much more expensive than a ball python, and require more exact caging, heating and humidity requirements. For the most part, they are a display snake, not one you can handle regularly like a corn or ball.  They are in general better eaters than a ball python though. I rarely have feeding issues with my chondros.  Stay far away from captive hatched/bred (i.e. farm raised or bred) chondros and only buy U.S. captive born and bred from someone reputable.  Imports will cause you nothing but grief.  Expect to pay around $400 for a basic cbb baby from a reputable breeder.  Yearlings will be higher in some cases although sometimes you can get lucky and find a nice adult or subadult on the forums for sale at that price.  Make sure you have a good reptile vet available in case of problems like a respiratory infection.  They are extremely sensitive snakes and die rapidly from things that wouldn't bother a cornsnake at all.  They are awesome though, and if you do it right, you'll be hooked for life.|`|vZFLG75Zaa	Ball python... those are great beginner pythons.  I have personally wanted one for years now... but my mom doesnt want a snake in the house haha... They stay relatively small only growing to about 5 feet.  But they are very social with their owners.  My friend just got a hatchling, and he is the best snake so far... he never bites, never feels threatened, and he is a quick eater.  He is much more active than any other python species I have encountered.|`|9TQ91Xpoaa	Well it depends, if you are a good snake owner and have good smarts on snakes then go for the tree python, they are more expensive, bigger, harder to care for but worth it beacuase they are beatiful snakes.

A corn snake is the ideal beginner snake and they in no way get u ready for a green tree python. They are absolutely beautiful creatures. I don't blame u for wanting one but u need lots of experience before moving to the GTP. They are extremly agressive snakes. I've had mine for about 4 months now and I've been bitten about 5 times now. Which is why I use gloves. Good thing its still a baby. They require a lot of care and attention. U would usually need to get a custom enclosure to fill its needs. There is just a lot that goes into getting a GTP. With that said I would say u should get a ball python. If u think ur ready for sumthing a tiny bit more advanced u can look into a colombian red tail boa. Rainbow boa. Or a dumerils ground boa. But a ball python is a perfect snake to start with which is larger and has a heavier build than a corn. Keep at it and soon u'll hav the knowledge and experince to get ur Green Tree Python. Good luck|`|QC4aS23xaa	i personally think green tree pythons are cooler, but ball pythons are hardier, easier to care for (require less), and are less likely to be aggressive.      all things considered, i'd get the green tree python if in fact you can care for it and are willing to put in the time with it.
OjXvYEZDaa	Yes, If cats are more than 6 months they are old enough for get neutured. but the surgeny is about 35 pounds ( UK )  If you are living in UK, you can try PDSA (animal vet charity, they could do it for free if you are on beneift but you will need proofs of being on income support) I had my dog fixed years ago. also just had my kitten fixed recently (I paid for it as I am working)|`|KLMo9jbzaa	I have no idea about what city you are talking about, but most cities offer a low cost spade/neuter clinics once or twice a week you would need to call them for information.|`|74jSlRbbaa	Hi if u are on benefits you may be able to take your cats to the pdsa but they do charge for neutering. Alternatively what i did is contact the cats protection (get the number off their website) and they send u out a 20 pound voucher for each cat  i got a 20 pound one for my boy cat and 25 pound i think for my girl cat and just take it along and any decent vets will accept the voucher and instead of paying 35-40 pound per cat u will only pay about 15 pnd per cat!!!!|`|J6Fj7iQFaa	Go onto the website www.rspca.com and find your local RSPCA branch. A simple phone call to them and they will post you vouchers to get free neutering as you are on benifits.

Take both of them to the vet ASAP!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Do you have a paper shredder that she may be getting paper from?  If so, perhaps she ate it.  My first inclination, however, is that the white paper strips may be worms.  Use a paper towel to scoop it up and take it with you to the vet.  They'll be able to tell you what it is and treat the kitten appropriately.  You do need to go, though because if it is worms your cat has a pretty bad infestation if she's throwing them up.  The chunky brown goop from your other cat is probably undigested food.  If this is a new behavior, I recommend taking the older cat in for a checkup as well.  Could be the same condition as with the kitten.|`|ImrVQbYmaa	My cat pukes everywhere, its not a problem  normally this happens when they eat too fast or if you pick them up after eating as it really up sets their stomachs.

There is something wrong not with the first one, but with your two cats. They might ate something that's harmful, have they been outside? If that's the case, search for something they have may ate, take it to the vet with you... sometimes cat get hairballs, that will make them throw up... but usually is a one time only in about a week. That is because their grooming habits, they lick themselves silly and take hair with their tongues and swallow it. But I don't think this is the case now. advise... take them both to the vet.  |`|P1SfKSNBaa	Get to the vet ASAP.|`|GBjDpgpaaa	your best bet is to take them to a vet, because obviously they got into something they didnt need to eat. hope i helped!|`|E8xRkTRPaa	GO TO THE VET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Instead of sitting on yahoo get ur *** up if u wanna help ur kitty...maybe shes dieing!!!!!!!!!|`|X8D3iM10aa	Whatever looks like paper strips is probably worms.    They can be really bad for your cat and it could possibly die if you don't cure it soon.    So take him/her to the vet ASAP!    And take the older cat along as well. I have no idea what he/she could have, but it could be something bad.

If she's not eating,rub a tiny amount of Karo Syrup on her gums every three or four hours,and moisten a cotton ball with plain,room temp water,and squeeze a very small amount into her mouth,just enough to moisten it,so she won't get dehydrated.|`|NTC6g8hYaa	AWWW!

Don't coddle her, don't go back to her, don't even look back.    Anytime she does bark while you are still around, lightly smack her on the nose  and tell her, "NO."  This gets the point across that you mean business without hurting her.  It lets her know that barking is bad.  Hopefully, she'll stop.  If not, I'd see a professional trainer or try out one of those sound-sensitive shock collars.|`|fjacQGvpaa	It sound like your dog has separation anxiety, there are many ways to curve this.

d68c191f4dca0538cb41201be80bb864aa	No, there isn't any human viruses that can be passed to a dog, unless the human has rabies and bites the dog. lol  Humans could pass ringworm to a dog, which isn't a worm/parasite, but a fungus. If the human has it first and makes contact with the dogs skin. Generally its the other way around.  Humans and dogs can get lyme disease and giardia, but they are passed from outside hosts (i.e. ticks and untreated water)  Humans can get West Nile virus from mosquitoes, but dogs don't. As dogs can get heartworm from mosquitoes, but humans don't.  That is why dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years. We are able to be around each other and not get sick.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	I'm not sure, but I know you can carry illnesses home that your animals can catch, such as parvo and feline distemper. If you've been in a place that a parvo-inflicted dog was at, regardless of if they were still there or not, you can carry that home and your own dog can catch it if he isn't vaccinated.|`|fhxY0zktaa	yeah u can but rarely |`|agsRZsvZaa	yes, they can...  when we get flu...  n our dog's is near, actually they can get it to...
lHZyKJowaa	Get him to the vet immediatly. How would you like it if no one took you to the doctors.|`|F0uLexezaa	give him a baby aspirin for the pain|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I hate people like that.  Maybe you should put them out for some thugs in the hood to use for target practice.  Anyway, you need to get an ex-ray.  No other way to tell, sorry.|`|7XJV8pl8aa	He probably doesn't like the feel of concrete or the heat on it. Get him some booties and he'll be fine.|`|ZhQ66VHpaa	I'd get a bat and beat the hell out of my roommates.|`|vOYuuLmgaa	Keep him quiet - no jumping, leash-walk only. If he has a kennel, use it.    The rule of thumb is that if he is putting weight on the leg, it is OK to wait 2-3 days. If the leg is non-weight bearing, he should be seen sooner rather than later.    As for the cut, I would clean it out with a little hydrogen peroxide, then continue with neosporin or another triple-antibiotic ointment until it scabs or begins to heal.    If the leg does not get better in several days, it may be vet-time. Along with sprains and strains, fractures and bruises, torn ligaments also fit on the "why my dog is lame" list.    X-rays are almost always a necessity to diagnose a fracture, and certainly necessary to correct it. Many options can be ruled in/out simply by a hands-on professional exam.    ETA: Please do not use over-the-counter pain medication. Many NSAIDS will cause kidney or liver failure faster than you can force him to eat it. While there are some that are safe in the correct dose, the incorrect dose can be just as detrimental. If you're worried about the pain, contact your vet about appropriate dosing/getting canine anti-inflammatories.|`|AA10233318	If he puts some weight on it rather than keeping the leg up all the time it usually means it is not fractured.  A fractured leg also will be swollen often and hurt a lot when the leg is touched. For pain you can try baby aspirin but I would consult with your vet first, below is a guide on aspirin|`|fxgnmSPQaa	if he/she is limping dosent walk straight or wont get up go to vet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|bUL2Pyx3aa	It realy dosent matter I would take him 2 the vet for both|`|M2EYvWRLaa	take him to a vet, if it is something serious, ur obviously not going to know.  and punch ur room mates for me, ok?
AA11584616	 No. They are crustaceans, shellfish. A fish is one that doesn't have a shell you have to crack or peel when you cook or eat it. |`|AA11708471	no there crustaceans      and the plural of shrimp is just shrimp not shrimps|`|urIm4YaBaa	No. Fish are vertebrates (have a backbone). Shrimp are crustraceans, which are exclusively invertebrates.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	No, they are shellfish (crustaceans, if you will).|`|Vwkuf13maa	I think they are considered an crustaceons    n., pl. shrimp or shrimps.    Any of various small, chiefly marine decapod crustaceans of the suborder Natantia, many species of which are edible, having a compressed or elongated body with a well-developed abdomen, long legs and antennae, and a long spinelike projection of the carapace.  Any of various similar crustaceans, such as certain isopods and amphipods.  Slang.   A person regarded as unimportant.

775UzN5Jaa	she might just be suprised, or if she is from a shelter, her old owner might of trated her badly or beat her there.|`|DhtxV686aa	same with cats.  either they're surprised by it,  or it just feels weird. 
uTIgyCCHaa	Yes, it WILL make her continue biting.    The reason puppies have such sharp little teeth is so that they WILL hurt whomever they are playing with, and then that playmate gives feedback with a yelp and ceases play for a few minutes.  When this happens consistently, the puppy learns that biting makes the fun stop, thus realizing the strength of its own jaws and learning how to inhibit the force of bites.  It's important that the puppy learns this now.  In a few months, all those needle teeth will be gone and your pup will have a new set of adult teeth -- and much stronger jaws.  An adult dog that never learned bite inhibition as a puppy can be dangerous.  You can't safely teach it once the dog is older -- true, adult teeth are not as sharp as a pup's, but a full-force adult bite will do MUCH more damage.    Here's a good article on how to teach bite inhibition.  http://www.jersey.net/~mountaindog/berne...    Playing with the mop might save your hands for now, but the mop won't teach her that it's NOT OK to bite humans.  You need to be playing with her (just you, nothing else) so that she has the chance to bite you -- otherwise you'd never have the chance to teach.  This doesn't mean you have to give up the mop game, but interaction with the mop cannot replace human interaction.    Also... hope this isn't a mop that you actually use for the floors -- otherwise cleaning would be VERY difficult once your pup gets a little bigger ;)    Almost forgot -- make sure you have some puppy chew-toys for her.  Remember to praise her when she chews on things that ARE appropriate, like her own toys.|`|CFOQBg9Naa	the puppy is teething|`|vkdYlgWtaa	Well... it might make her keep chewing.|`|775UzN5Jaa	when she bites u she is play biting. When she does this say OUCH! in a high piched voice like a puppy would say it. It will startle her and make her stop biting. when she does not bite give her a healthy reward like a hand full of her meal of baby carrots.|`|AUKq5i9Oaa	It's probably teething.|`|Xvb79Ebzaa	Yes, she will continue to bite, but it is only normal for puppy to nip at this age. This faze will stop when he is about 1 and a half years of age. |`|FbvpCc1Taa	when she nips at you whats you need to do is give her a flick or tap on the nose and YELL no bite and let her know she can not do that   it might seem mean but it works every time she does it say the so she know and if she keeps doing it do it a lil harder|`|yKD8ZIK7aa	This is mouthing and it is a normal behavior in puppies. But as other people have pointed out, it can be controlled by redirecting her attention with a loud noise. Being only 8 wks old, your puppy will make a lot more mistakes before she understands what you want. Some people prefer not to correct mouthing behavior as long as it stays within safe boundaries "play biting". Keep in mind that puppy teeth are incredibly sharp and will hurt every now and again. Also remember that if you choose not to correct this behavior, it will be harder to correct later. I personally let my pets play bite as it is normal behavior but I made sure they were trained to keep it gentle. I do this by telling them the command gentle if they get too rough. In a puppy this behavior does the same redirect without forcing them to never play bite.     Also tug of war can cause some aggressive tendencies but that isn't always a guarantee. I play tug of war with my dogs all the time and they have never shown an aggressive tendency.     The important thing is letting your puppy know when play is okay and when it isn't. For example, don't let they play tug of war with drapes or rolls of toilet paper as I'm sure you don't want this behavior encouraged. Also don't let her play tug of war with your pant leg as that could lead to tripping a guest. Make sure your puppy knows not to chew on wires or other objects that may hurt her. Give her plenty of toys and chews to redirect her teething pains onto a desirable object. You have a long way to go until those adult teeth will grow in so be prepared for a few mistakes during this young age. |`|RSJTy4cdaa	If she's just biting then that's normal puppy behavior and you should discourage her from biting by yelling "Owww" and walking away from her and stop playing immediately. Do that everytime. But if she is snapping at you, that is not normal. It is not a good idea to play tug-of-war with dogs because it teaches some of them to be aggressive. |`|b5uzLQ4Laa	when she bits you bit her back. It might sound mean but 1 time she wont bit again dont bit her hard|`|nhZb43pIaa	I agree with two other posters, the puppy is teething and play biting. Something she would be doing with her litter mates as well.  Get a few nice things for her to chew on, and when playing let her know when biting is ok and when it's getting to rough (IE; saying OUCH fairly loud to startle her) They know, she will learn soon enough and please keep in mind it's a baby (learning, experiencing, growing) No need for hard discipline.    Good Luck|`|GJ0MkJO5aa	It is probably teething.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Tug of war is an aggression type of play. I would stop that at once. Better would be Frisbee or tether ball. Allowing to snap at you reinforces that he is in control not you.|`|e549a7f848bc25ac145a744db895fb5faa	All puppies do that! the mop might not effect it either way but it is good to give her something to bite on... What I do when playing an they get a little nippy I just stand up straight and put my hand straight out and say NO biting! I let them know it's wrong and after a few times of doing that they are fine.. If that doesn't work just let it grow a little. It's the kinda thing that comes with the age, once it settles down a little bit i'm sure the nipping will stop. Best of Luck |`|FFbWgs0Xaa	Puppies go through a biting stage; it is part teething and part being playful.  As huskies are powerful dogs it is best to nip biting in the bud in case she doesn't grow out of it (mosy puppies do stop this on their own).  When she bites say no and stop playing and ignore her; she will soon learn that a bite to a human means no playing and no attention.  If she plays with no biting give lots of praise.

OR1QdBLjaa	It sounds like your dog may have anything from a tumor to a lipomas (fatty deposit under the skin, usually harmless)    either way, when your vet sees your dog, he may want to stitch it to stop the bleeding, and will perscribe an antibiotic to prevent it from getting an infection.    an infection is a very serious thing in an older dog.  if your dog seems otherwise healthy and happy, i seriously doubt he would recommend putting her down.  after all, that would result in the loss of a customer!    if you can afford it, PLEASE take your dog to the vet.  older dogs have a harder time healing wounds.    for the time being, try to keep it bandaged or at least put on a ton of antibacterial ointment like neosporin.  the vet may also perscribe a stronger version of this.|`|682wOlBeaa	Definently take her.

They will not put her down. Give your old girl a chance for a great rest of her life|`|e16a8c7e1eb3c7768d0c63de7a721e75aa	Take her to the vet.  They can't force you to euthanize her if you don't agree.  But they may be able to help with whatever is wrong with her, and they might just end up saving her life.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Whatever the cause, if she's bleeding she probably will need a course of antibiotics.  They cannot force you to have her put down.  It has to be your decision, with the advice of your vet about her prognosis.|`|Octzpyyhaa	My dog is 13...full of life.

Your dog is a senior!!

They can't do it without the consent of the owners.    If the bump is anything, you're better off catching it early rather than waiting for it to be too late.  Take her!    Of course there's still a chance.  You can't determine anything without a diagnosis from a vet.|`|eAT5yShMaa	Yeah i would get it checked out and like your mom said they can't force you to put your dog down. they have to have your permission to do so. 
AxaspNJJaa	You already have 1 dog, be grateful! Do you know how much I want a dog, but can't??? You have one, for like 1 year, now you want another one, after 1 year!!! Be grateful, don't be greedy.

Pay for the dog yourself and maybe I'll agree with you, but for now, no.|`|vHWUjgkkaa	Just be lucky that your 1st dog is alive and stop wanting more thanking |`|e8f990ffdbf3bb4e7e0e53a9296b61a9aa	Best answer- Take care of your FIRST dog.     My daughter may believe that she cares for our dogs, but I am the one that bathes them, clips their nails, brushes, walks, feeds them, and takes them to the vet. It can be a lot of work, and another dog is twice as much work- not to mention much more cost! Animals costs money to adopt and to buy heartworm meds and take to the vet, to board when you go away Maybe your parents don't have money to dish out for that. AND lets not forget the life long responsibility that comes with a pet.     Talk to your parents about how you would help pay for the dog and show that you have the ability to care for the new pet (and old). If they arent ready to have a new pet for 14 or so years, maybe you could talk to them about being a fostercare pet parent for your local SPCA. :o)|`|Fi4XTtKvaa	You just got the dog last year!!  forget about it! your lucky you even have one, i dont.

How about a noise that you would use only for displeasure/dislike in something they're doing. I do a sort of quick hiss at my cat when he is doing something that I don't like. If you're consistent enough they will get the idea that the noise means to stop what you're doing or you'll get in trouble. Also, for your stuff, have you looked into getting a small shelf or some sort of organizational covers? If the kittens can't access the fun stuff, then they won't come around trying to play with it. Who wants to visit a countertop that is boring and has nothing fun to play with? A smaller shelf on a wall could be the place that you keep all of your stuff from now on, or holders with lids to keep your bobby pins kept tight and safe. You should also provide a variety of things for your kittens to play with elseware so that you can distract them from wanting to play in the bathroom.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Try covering the counter top with tin foil - many cats don't like the feel of it and after a few attempts at jumping up on the icky feeling tin foil you can remove it.|`|btghmpQhaa	Watch your cats and whenever they are on the counter have a spray bottle available, spray them and they will jump off.

6Rt9aM8daa	Don't worry, he did that so he can cool off. Its normal. But, consult a vet or something because male rats should normally have it out all the time or in hot times. he may have had a blockage.|`|kBaz5eyHaa	Male rats can tend to suck in the balls, if they're scared or even intimidated. With a slight press of the lower belly they will pop out.     If you observe him closely when he is relaxed his balls should drop naturally.    I dont want to be a 'TAKE HIM TO THE VET' person, but if you havent noticed this for a year then it could be some sort of testicular cancer, a once over from the vet will make you sleep easy I think.  On this note: BEWARE, DONT GIVE MALE RATS ANY CITRUS!!    Good luck :)
XzV4bUeFaa	Usually no, but if some fleas get in on another animal that's brought into your house, then yes.  Also sometimes fleas can get into the house brought in by clothing of a person that they've jumped onto.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	You need to get Fronline or Advantage for kittens it pricey, but it works and consider bombing you place with flea bombs, remember the cheaper ones you buy, do the less and the better ones cost more and they work.|`|mzoXmSpYaa	My cat got worms for fleas... and he has never been outside... so yes, they can get fleas even when they are indoor cats
x0WZE0i4aa	Do you know what the vet thinks it is?  Dehydration, lack of apetite, vomiting and muscle wasting can all be caused by kidney disease.  Sub Q fluids are used as a treatment for that in the States.  But I've just looked up Clavaseptin and apparently it's commonly used for skin infections.  I'm puzzled!    If it is kidney disease: both my cats have had this condition. One was diagnosed first, and is still with me over 2 years later.  The other I had to have pts 7 weeks after diagnosis. In the last week I was learning about possible treatments (including Sub Q's which are controversial here in the UK).  But I decided I didn't have the money, and maybe not the time, to keep trying different treatments.  I had the money to get blood tests, but the rest? And much of what I was hearing about would take weeks to work even if I got hold of it, and my cat was wasted to the point she was having difficulty walking and using the tray.  I decided to have her pts BEFORE she really suffered. It was too much of a gamble with her welfare to keep trying things.  Before we went in we sat and watched squirrels in the sun (her in her basket), and the pts was done with no rushing, very calm and peaceful.  I had it done using a catheter, so I was able to hold her.    I think you need to talk to your vet, but it does sound like, unless there's a sudden improvement, I think you should be thinking about pts. I know how horrible it is not to be able to help your cat, when you know that maybe something could be done if you only had more money.  But it does sound like, if it is kidney disease, he's quite advanced with it.  There's no cure for it, only things that can slow the progression.  So it may be there's not a massive amount that could be done anyway. I sometime think maybe not having money may have just saved dragging things out for my cat.

Try tempting him with tuna, chicken, deli meats(plain), meat baby food, no onions,plain yogurt. Try warming a can of cat food in the microwave as the smell may entice him.    You can give 1/4 tab of pepcid ac for upset stomach    You did not say what brought this on or what previous symptoms were or what meds you are giving|`|grXWVPmDaa	hi there, i would ask your vet if its right or not, if he is in pain its best to let the lil guy go to sleep, my cat was sleeping in strange places mainly the airing cupboard he eventually died on his own, he didnt stop eating much but when they start to be sick all the time and release their bowels alot its prob coming to the end. double check with ur vet. hope this helps. tania xx|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Should you really be owning a pet? Owning a pet is like raising a child and you always need to be prepared for medication, shots, vet visits, food and so on. Talk to the vet and get his/her advise.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	for me.  i just knew...  my cat was suffering with diabetes and it's kidneys were failing.  it just wasn't the same cat anymore, and i felt horrible watching him loose weight despite constantly eating, drinking excessive amounts of water, saturating his litter box so bad i chad to change it daily, etc.  the insulin and other meds just weren't working.    i tell you, it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.  i still miss him to this day, and find myself getting a little misty whenever i see a picture of him.    i would be willing to bet, the cost of the blood work would be the same as the cost of putting the cat down.  talk to your vet, and see what they might suggest.  some vets will even spread out payments over a period of time if cash is tight.  most vets aren't the type of people to do everything in their power to get you to keep your cat alive for the money it would bring them.  they want what's best for the cat, just like you...|`|tcMC1dJ2aa	If he is almost 17 and he seems to be really ill then it's time. If he was a younger cat then I would say there is something you can yet do for him. But when they are that old there is not much you can do even if you can afford the vet. So it is best to put him out of his misery and let him be at peace. I am sorry. I know letting go of a long loved animal is hard.

I was on their site the other day and saw that they were on back order for almost every bulb, so that may have been a one-time occurrence, may be worth trying them again...    You can get various types of MVBs from LLLreptile.com and Bigappleherp.com    I've used the T-Rex Active UV, same price as the megarays, but I've never had one last more than about 2 months...

VOIs9Kxqaa	yes, getting him netured will help decress it to a degree. Having him netured also has health benfits like decressing cancer in his "stuff".    Being "pack leader, or top dog" will also help correct this behaviour, if he's not getting enough excersize...that should help too.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Getting a male dog neutered can cause him to become less aggressive. Neutering gets rid of the testosterone that makes some males aggressive. It doesn't work all the time, if depends on if your dog's aggression is hormonal or behavioral.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It won't decrease aggression.  It will lower the testosterone level and keep him from roaming around looking for females, but otherwise you just have a badly trained dog on your hands.|`|F03UbGA3aa	So basically your options are to lob of his balls or to train him?  How about both.  That should solve all problems and ensure that an aggressive dog doesn't reproduce.|`|WS8ZvFpEaa	Yes it does because it calms down their hormones (:|`|xkzkCtrUaa	It actually calms them down|`|xF7XLRQzaa	Get him fixed!  Just say no to humping and marking of territory.  When they are fixed they have no territory and they don't care who invades it.

The average corgi is born with a short stumpy tail|`|4SQx8smEaa	Some people just prefer the look, same thing with cropping dogs ears.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	For one thing, they are often born with short tails.

OyNJTWaiaa	Your Answer:  Back to budgie sexing school for everyone who said female as they are wrong. Also wrong is anyone who said the cere would turn blue if it was a boy. First look at the budgie type as many types of budgies cere NEVER turn blue if a boy and this is one of them.  Those that said it is a lutino are also wrong. A lutino has red eyes and NO MARKINGS. This bird is a lightly marked recessive pied and IS A MALE budgie. If a female its cere would be whitish from baby to 5 months or so. If older at around 5-8 months of age when a cere changes colour...if a female it would go brownish, if a male it would stay the colour it is now.|`|KhjpmxGeaa	It is a female,Males Normally above their beaks is blue,Females have a brown above their beaks.Um..How about Tweety Or June?|`|DJa2wS86aa	female the chure is pink not blue|`|Oii9H4g6aa	she is DEFINITELY a girl becaus she has a pink cere and beak, males have blue ones :)|`|fQ3d5iAWaa	It's actually really hard to tell at the age like the bird is right now. But it's seems like this is a girl, boys usually have blue on the top of they're beeks, girls usually have brown. So i say it's a girl but the color might change in time, and as i said earlier they're to young to tell for sure.|`|fXhSTwvCaa	Its A girl cause of the pink above the beak I have had parakeets before and I had one Just like yours. As for a name sunshine would be a good one for her.|`|xowm9t3kaa	shes a girl and not very young either|`|Pyr5jQPMaa	byw it is luinto so the cere is diffrent.

If you have more ?s then you can msg me!!!|`|ml2OxC16aa	its a female|`|JIy11vWcaa	it's a boy. boy budgies have bright colours on the top of their beaks, and females have brown on the top of their beaks|`|zIolD9xXaa	congrats its a boy. the best thing to do is to go onto the internet and serch how to sex a lutino parakeet and loads of websites should be ready with help ! amazing he's beautiful, i wish i had one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
rrFbQZzIaa	unfortunately when it comes to snakes, the only way to really tame them is to handle them more. And w/ it striking, that can be tough. If you're not afraid of getting bit, then you'll just have to get over the emotional hurdle. You can wear gloves if need be. If it's biting you after you've picked it up, it may just take time to warm up. If it's just biting you when you reach into the cage that's something that's very normal and can easily be avoided. usually if that's the case they feel threatened which is nothing to be hurt about. so if that's the case, just place something over it's face like a paper towel or sock, and pick it's body up or hold the face down lightly w/ something similar to a snake stick, and pick the body up. once in your hands it should be fine|`|r8ETcmHMaa	Just handle him every chance you get. The more you handle him the more he'll feel comfortable. Also if he bites when holding him do not put him down. This tells him that if he bites you he gets to go back in the enclosure like he wanted.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Continue to handle this snake regularly. It should tame down in time. If you do not want to get bit, in the meantime, wear some gardening gloves till the taming process is completed.|`|qxkRS4bZaa	just try to hold it more often|`|MX9M36B4aa	I know you got away with feeding your other two in their cages but each snake has its own personality.So i think maybe with this one it would be in your best interest to use a feeding tank for him,and if you are uneasy holding him because you have been struck at he will sense that as he is the dominate one and he will continue to strike at you.I know from first hand experience it does hurt like a _i_ch:)But it is something that is most likely going to happen with this snake but the more you hold him the better he will get.I know that is what you already know,and prob did not want to hear:)LOL...But it is the only way and you and i both know that..........Ps use gloves when training him and keep an arm distance between the two of ya.I wish you the best of luck with this honey.Yours truly the lizard lady|`|nmzpdvkqaa	you should not feed him inside the cage he lives in, move slowly around him so he knows you mean him no harm, pick him up ignoring the bites and hold about 20 mins. a day untill he calms down then you can hold him for longer periods of time. try not to come down on him from the top because birds are their natural predators. pick him up from the side so you dont freak him out.|`|vZFLG75Zaa	hopefully, you arent feeding it in its tank right?

wJRHTS7Maa	by breeding the smallest of each gender of the dog and then poof u get runts!!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Just like regular dogs - the term means runt.  Usually only the runt of a litter from a byb or mill  will be labeled teacup by them.  Hardly any of the  dogs that ppl consider to be "teacup" can be bred - they are too small & it will kill them & the pup.    Teacup is a makeup term in the dog world by crappy breeders to get more money.|`|cETQuE9waa	One very unstandard/unhealthy dog bred to another very understandard/unhealthy dog to produce very understandard and unhealthy puppies.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	Irresponsibly|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Poorly, irresponsibly, and incorrectly.    Dog A-- Severely undersized, Smallest dog from previous litter  Dog B-- Runt of the litter    Dog A + Dog B = Dogs C thru F, all dogs in this litter are undersized and carry several potentially fatal diseases (like Liver Shunts). Have trouble breathing, passing fluids, defecating, seeing, and more often than not, moving.
AA12310378	They don't do the recommended testing  for the breed - just a token vet check and none of their "parents" are show quality, in fact from the photos on their website they are poor quality.    I would say they just breed puppies to sell, not to produce quality KCKS.    Not a breeder I would choose. Definatelty a BYB or more likely what in England is called a puppy farm;- somewhere puppies are produced purely for sale (conditions the dogs are kept in may be good or poor but the dogs are rarely of breeding quality, they just have working gonads.)    A pet puppy from a show litter would probably be better quality and at least the parents should have had all the required tests.  A one year guarantee is worthless.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	Sounds to me like they are what's called a "Hobby Breeder" which is a breeder that does all the appropriate genetic health testing yet they don't show their dogs in AKC conformation. So sure their dogs may be healthy yet they may not conform to the AKC breed standard. They may have longer muzzles, shorter ears, long legs, etc.     And being that the puppies are inexpensive there must be a catch. A well bred pet quality Cavalier pup with champion lines start at about $2,500.    ADD: Just viewed the website you posted. Noticed on some of their adult dogs they have freckles on their muzzles. Freckles on a Cavalier's face is considered a fault in the breed. Also noticed the Ruby puppies. They have white on them. That is a major fault in the Ruby coloring. They are not to have any white on them what so ever.|`|Re576Xa5aa	gove us the site, I'd go with a one year guarantee for (genetic)health|`|xPxm8ONiaa	I'd rather spend $500 more on a healthy, purebred dog, then spend $300 for a dog from a byb. It sells itself :)|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Honestly i have seen way better dogs then what she has. At least one of her parent bitches does not look up to standard. And also she named her puppies  reputable breeders generally dont name their puppies because its harder to give them up that way.     And another thing reputable breeders dont put their prices online.    If you want a quality dog you have to cough up the money.    Wait but didnt you want to find a breeder in PA?|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Sounds ok, except for the one year genetic problems.  Most testing cannot be done until the dogs are at least two years old.  I would want to make sure that the contract guaranteed until two years.    *I* would also want to see the parents, and where the pups are raised.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	They sound very reputable. The health testing is great, I agree.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Eh i don't know they seem reputable but i have to agree i would ask for a 2 year health guarantee..other then that i would go see the parents and where there raised. Then make my decision.     PS. At first glance Jewel looks like a weimaraner :D He is such the cutie!
qR3MYSOIaa	My 9 year old cats do that sometimes, I watch them while they eat, if they don't take it slow, I'll make a noise or walk close to them to distract them and they slow down with that.      My husband's approach is a little different, he'll chase them from the kitchen if he sees they're not coming up for air while eating.    I'm feeding Wellness so I know it's not a food quality issue, they just really love it, Turkey and Lobster...how can you go wrong?  They don't do it with the dry that's available all day, just the wet that only gets served 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Sounds crazy but put out a smaller portion of food and put large stones in his bowl (ones he cannot ingest of course) he will have to eat more slowly this may help. They use this trick on dogs who have been eating to quickly also. Also make sure the cat has hairball treatment as a hairball that is lodged for a bit will also induce vomiting after a meal.  Wishing you and kitty luck on this! Mine still does it at times too!|`|grG9hxmeaa	Serve him little portions of food with time in between eating.|`|SlkKa1jsaa	My cat does it too sometimes,try a different food you can probably not get him to puke so often.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	give him like a fourth of it then make him wait about 15 minutes before you give him more. Keep doing that until he is done. Good luck.    Love,  Michelle
L2Gi2tPmaa	Dogs can't read minds but they can read your body language and your state of mind.      You can read dogs body language.  Check out these websites.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	no; but they do know how you feel by your emotions and if your sick they will comfort you...dogs bark when they are playing or alert ...you can tell how your dog feels by its actions|`|ArtZzDU8aa	Body Language.|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	they can sense tension and emotion. Animals perceive body language very much, aggressive stances and dominant postures. They can not read your mind. You can actually read theirs so to speak when you become more familiar with how dogs and their ancestors communicate. Its very simple, they also have an extremely heightened sense of smell and can smell hormones and other such chemical releases.|`|eAzq2N9raa	no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no. buddy, you have been watching TOO MANY cartoons. start watching the discovery channel or something, not scooby doo!|`|vw7ebwgnaa	Dogs are actually pretty smart. They can sense tension in the room and can sense happiness. They can also sense someone's tone of voice. When you punish a dog I've heard you are supposed to use a harsher tone, because if you use a lovey dovey tone they think you are praising them.
lTsDwY9Paa	Any time you see blood coming from your dog you should at least call the vet for advice.|`|6qsocyK3aa	1) Why the hell do you have a 6 week old puppy anyway? He's much too young to be away from his mother.    2) Defecating blood, whatever the reason, is not a good thing. Shouldn't common sense have told you that? Please call your vet for advice instead of asking a bunch of strangers online.

If it wasn't a sport, someone made a BIG mistake . I personally hate people who think its not a sport.|`|WmXS7gzWaa	Yes, definitely!  Do some searches for Grand Prix jumping, horseracing, or Dressage and you should find some good websites to support your paper.|`|ECgFNEWjaa	Just do a search on "definition sport".  Here's one link that may get you started http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport|`|I8dkpUQ7aa	Yes it's a sport. It's so tiring to hear people always saying it isn't. Perhaps you should argue this; at my high school we have an Equestrian Team. We are the state champs and have been for many years, and we have won more trophies than any other sport. Also, I got my varsity jacket in this sport. That alone should prove it's a sport!  Secondly, if people are arguing that it isn't a sport, begin to ask them questions like...  -Do you know what a flying lead change is, and how to get your horse to do it?  -Can you get your horse to jump  -Do you know what 2 point is  -Do you know the correct trotting diagonals, then?  -Can you ride bareback well?  -Can you get your horse on bit?  Keep going using all the technical terms, and stress all the physical work. Eventually they will shut up and get the message. You can also relate how much muscle strength it takes to ride by saying; can YOU press your legs into a 1200 pound animal for hours straight? Can you sit correctly and never remove your legs from the horse's side while riding?  You can then finish with a smug "i didn't think so"  good luck, and show them it IS a sport!|`|N9FaHxEuaa	Only people that ride understand its a sport the rest of the world is oblivious.

AM7CgQ4daa	to compare them it is best to compare black/tan show dogs with working lines against the white shepherd.    In Australia I would compare the white shepherd to the working shepherd, in that it normally has a high prey drive, has a fairly straight back and good hips.  I am a member of a WGSD club and find that on the whole they are slightly gentler in nature, but still protective.  But we are talking tiny differences, the dogs have the same history and are basically the same.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	the main difference is color    the white shepard is only slightly different than the other colors|`|MLC97M1Baa	I have heard there are none really, the only thing I have heard colour wise about Shepherds is that the black ones tend to be more crazy in general. But I have no idea if this is just speculation. Aren't they getting recognized soon? They are a beautiful breed.|`|A9qDWpXUaa	No. The only difference is coat colour.|`|smFfcmYuaa	The short answer is no.     The long answer is that In general there's more variance within those colors of German Shepards than there are between them. The more important factor is the particular breeding and raising of the dog in question. Of course there are mutations (I mean distinct characteristics not present in the parents or other known relatives rather than an extra tail or something like that) in any species but if a dog has sluggish parents it will probably be sluggish, if both parents were agility or herding champions then it's more likely that the offspring will be as well.
bMYv0fBHaa	It's much sadder that you want to buy an irresponsibly bred dog from a pet store (puppy mill). The reason dogs are in shelters is because of that!    Please adopt. Shelters are filled to the brim with Chihuahuas and other small dogs--adopt!|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	Not the pet stores!  Most animals at pet stores come from mills.  Not sure what this is?  Google puppy mills.  That is sad, it will break your heart!  Go to the pound or contact a local rescue group and save a life instead.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	look on petfinder.com   It's a web site that all shelters put their animals on so people can view them without physically going to the shelter.  Don't buy from a pet store.  all those puppies come from puppy mills and the pup will have several health problems throughout its life.  Sometimes the pups don't survive to celebrate their 1st birthday.  It's safer to adopt from a shelter.|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	Buy from a reputable breeder or a shelter/rescue.  Please do not buy from a "pet store".    There is no such thing as a TEACUP chihuahua, they are a marketing ploy to sell unhealthy, smaller than normal dogs.    Check out petfinder.com  or find a breeder through http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/|`|jDGF4cjlaa	I live in canada and I recently got a teacup chihuahua from a breeder in atlanta, georgia.   the website is www.chi-mountain.com.  the owners name is Sherry, and she is super nice, she made sure my chihuahua travelled safely and even convinced the airport staff to allow her food in her crate while she flew to the buffalo airport.  i am EXTREMELY happy with this breeder.  also, my dog has a great personality, and no health problems.  she goes to the vet regularly and is as healthy as any other dog.  it's worth it to go straight to a breeder like Sherry.
O545aSKWaa	Alright... I hope you're ready for a long answer :)  Her history might be an issue. If she's aggressive towards other people then it might have something to do with her being abused by people. But, since you only mentioned that she is aggressive towards other dogs I'll assume that's her only issue and it is also not medically related.  there are a few different types of aggression. FEAR AGGRESSION would be your most difficult one to deal with. That is the type of aggression where the dog feels as though it's very life is being threatened and must defend itself to the death. Another would be DOMINANCE AGGRESSION in this case your dog has either assumed that it is the leader in most situations or feels insecure about it's position/rank with other dogs and must constantly assert it's dominance. The third most common one is POSSESSION AGGRESSION where the dog needs to own things.    All of these can be worked with but they take a lot of time and patience. The most important thing you can do is try to understand why type of aggression your dog is exhibiting.    A good trainer would begin here. They should try and determine the type of aggression and then put together a plan to deal with that type of aggression.    Your dog is not too old for behavioral modification. Ideally you'll want to start at about 3 months, but hey it's never too late!    Also, keep in mind that if you have no other dogs in your home there is no rule about having to make your dog get along with other dogs. She doesn't have to have other doggy friends in order to be happy. She can be just as fulfilled by only having you and your family as her pack, so don't feel pressured.     As for hiring a trainer to do private lessons, that should be more expensive than doing group classes and cheaper than doing any type of "Doggy Boot Camp" (this is where the dog stays somewhere for a while and is trained by someone)    If you have any more questions or want to go a little deeper into it all feel free to contact me :)     My wife and I have been training dogs for a while and love helping people whenever we can!|`|Z3OTphZhaa	In my opinion, it is never too late to take a dog to training classes, but you have to find the right trainer.  It can get costly, especially if you want private lessons.  Do some research, ask someone who may know about reputable trainers in the area and go from there.  Good luck!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	No its not too late. What sort of training? Basic training or a behavioral problem? For one you need a trainer(one on one) and the other a behaviorist.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	Yes it can work... and sometimes actually most times a private trainer trains you where they train the other dogs but without the otehr dogs and normally cost alot of money... She should deserve to have a better life like she should have before.... i know what its like having an adult dog that isnt socialized.... but mine isnt agressive but she is very "alpha dog" type lol Good luck and im sure a dog expert could.... try watching some dog whisperer shows he's an expert at this! (you can contact him too.)|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	you can train any dog to do anything so yes its possible. it all just depends on the trainer and how patient they are.|`|G5WOeutQaa	I'm no expert but a dog will become social only if it wants to. I guess a solution without going to a trainer would be to get another dog maybe or to have a lot of people around and she will get used to it.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	It is not too late to help her, but it will take some effort and she may never be the life of the party.  Hiring a trainer does take some money, and more importantly, time.  I've listed some resources below, as finding the right trainer is important- if you find a trainer who uses harsh methods, it could set the dog back.
SMFhXxcfaa	Keep on crate training him, and he will feel more secure in the crate and not scream bloody murder when he is left alone.  It took my puppy a couple of weeks to turn his screaming into a quiet whine.  now he loves his crate.  Don't baby him when he is screaming and if he is in another room or in the crate don't let him out until he is quiet.  if you give him attention when he is loud he will think that the louder he is, the quicker he can get out or get attention from you.  Since he is younger, I recommend a heat source besides yourself.  Like a rice sock (regular rice in a sock microwave until warm and wrap in a blanket or t-shirt)  or heating pad.  the puppy with snuggle in it and fall asleep.  good luck|`|6eIBIOwoaa	You need to crate train him...and whenever its bedtime, or you leave , you need to put him in his bed. He will learn to love it, but for the first days/week he will cry or howl.|`|r5iuE2mSaa	You may want to give him a stuffed animal and a sock. Also, leave a radio on country music.|`|BWJyLZUYaa	crate train him dogs like to have someplace they can retreat to anyway leave him alone a few min at a time and increase the length of time also put some of your old NOT WASHED clothes in the create with him they still have your scent on them my dogs i just say bed when i go away they go to their kennel and wait for their puppy cookies use puppy cookies also to create train him good luck|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	When you puppy cries or fusses and you give him what he wants, you are rewarding a bad behavior.

(They can see things on both sides of them)    A horse has a wide range of vision. A horse can see completely around its entire body except for small blind spots directly in front of its face, underneath its head, and directly behind itself.     Where a horse's ear points is normally where the horse is looking. If their ears are pointing in different directions, the horse is looking at two different things at a time. Of course, there are exceptions to this, like when a horse pins its ears, that doesn't mean its looking straight back.     Horses can see better at night than humans, but it takes a horse's eyes longer to adjust from light to dark and vice verse.    Horses have a prehensile upper lip.

They took him to an equine chiropractor/veterinarian.  She worked on him for about 1 1/2 hours - his jaw was out of alignment, two ribs were out of alignment, his spine had several vertabrae out of alignment, and the sacrum was out of alignment.  The vet got him adjusted and you could see the relief of pain in his face.  The cause of all of this was an infection of sorts (I don't remember what it was called).  Horses do not spread it, but are the end receivers.  He was pretty well over the illness, but he was put on "bed" rest for several days. My granddaughter could only walk him twice a day for thirty minutes to keep his joints limber.  She did some stretching of his hind legs to help.  When she could ride him again, he was very hesitant to move out - because the last time he was riden, he hurt.  He's doing fine now and really willing to work.  He was on antibiotics and another medication to prevent the infection re-occurring.

She didn't get her male fixed and you didn't get your female fixed!  I'd call that even steven!

(I know THAT from past experience but never did find who owned the male dog!)|`|ydshiNrKaa	What's the purpose of telling the neighbor her dogs got yours pregnant?  What do you want her to do about it?  Help find homes for the puppies? Help with the vet bills?

Did you sell them or keep them?  Does your neighbor often let the dog run loose?  If no to these questions then you should just kindly say that you request that your neighbor's dog be kept in the yard, inside or on a leash, just in case ". . ." happens again.  Unless you wanted your dog to become pregnant, then you should bring it up nicely but firmly and say that you did not intend for your dog to breed with his/her dog and hopefully they will listen.  If it was YOUR dog that got into the other dog's yard, then maybe it should be you that keeps better track of your animals.

EcjfWdsbaa	Socialization is very important for puppies. It is critical to socialize them, especially during the first four months of their life.   The behaviour you see from her is very likely due to a lack of socialization. Her meeting another dog or another person is not socialization.

KeevlZnTaa	Most likely you are seeing a turtle called a Red eared Slider, and it is being kept in a tank that is too small for it. The general recommendation for aquatic turtles(which is what you are looking for) is 10 gals PER inch of shell, therefore you would need to find a turtle that was only an inch in size and would stay that small(which is not going to happen). If you are in the US, all turtles sold must be at least 4 inches(and need 40 gal tank to start).    Some places will sell unassuming people small RES at an inch(which is illegal), and not tell them about proper care. Turtles are not as easy to care for than you think. They require expensive equipment to stay healthy.     You first issue is that turtles are omnivores and will eat fish. As they grow up they need less protein, so they will eat more veggies. As babies(which is what the small turtles would be), they need to eat fish, and other high protein foods.    As memtioned before, the turtles you are seeing are not kept properly. Aquatic turtles spend the majority of their time in the water and need a space that is mostly water and gives them space to swim. Some places sell RES in small carrying tanks with a plastic island and a small amount of water to make it seem as if these are ok conditions. Many of these animals suffer and die a slow death.    The equipment for aquatic turtles is expensive. You need a water heater in the tank(depending on the breed of turtle will determine the water temp). If the water is too cold many turtles will not eliminate waste(since they go into hibernation). Aquatic turtles will only eliminate in water, and therefore you need a very strong filter. Turtles are high waste producers, and a strong filter and bi-weekly water change will keep the water clean.    A basking area is a must. This basking area must be warm, and heated with a heat lamp. Without the warmth the turtle will not digest food and die. Without the heat lamp he will also not dry properly when he comes out of the water and you will see fungus begin to grow on the shell. In addition to a basking light, you need a UVA/UVB light. These light are essential and mimic the sun. They provide vit D, which prevents shell rot. UVA/B light are not cheap and last only about 3 months. I spend about 20-30 for my UVA/B light every 3 months.     Be sure that any turtle you get, you are aware of the care and requirements. Some shading places will tell you that a turtle will stay small and can live in a small tank, but do your research. The last thing you want is a turtle growing to be the size of a dinner plate(which is how big a RES can get). Turtles are also a long term commitment, sometimes as song as 40-60 years.

lhOd2hvXaa	Purina is pretty proactive when it comes to getting the word out about recalls.  There is nothing currently on their website (http://www.purina.com/) about any recall.     If it would make you feel better you can give them a call 1-800-778-7462 (1-800-7PURINA) (Mon. - Fri., 7 a.m. - 7 p.m. CT).

n4pNNcGfaa	As I answered previously...    Therapy dogs go where they are invited to cheer up people or educate. Sometimes they are welcome at hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, schools, group homes, or libraries.    Some therapy dogs make social visits for petting. Their owners talk with the person being visited, usually about the therapy dog or about the patient's own pets.    Some therapy dogs do educational programs, such as bite prevention education or fire safety education at schools.    Some therapy dogs help teach reading at public libraries by providing patient appreciative ears to listen to being read allowed without correcting the reader or judging them by their mistakes.    Some therapy dogs visit disaster areas, such as New Orleans or the World Trade Center, or even Iraq to help with issues related to PTSD.    Become involved with a therapy dog program by contacting one of the well recognized parent programs:    http://www.deltasociety.org  http://www.tdi-dog.org  http://www.therapydogs.com|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	They visit people in hospitals or seniors' homes or even kids in schools along with their owners.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Visit senior centres, hospitals, schools, and special needs places sometimes. They go to bring a smile to a face, relax a patient, or just visit lonely people.|`|c2d91f8848c790497d198b753a8d3401aa	Therapy dogs provide assistance in a variety of ways: they can work with stroke victims to encourage movement such as brushing or throwing a ball, they can work with young children and provide an ever eager year for young readers to improve self esteem and reading scores, they can be used for people who have been emotionally challenged.  In one case, a German shepherd dog accompanied a young girl into a court room to face her sexual abuser.  They are currently being used in Iraq for the soldiers to have some stress relief as simple as petting a dog.  So, the short answer is, they do as many functions to support as people can conceive.|`|AA12269056	dear amberles,      therapy dogs are usually taken to a hospital or nursing home by a caring and well trained handler.   they bring comfort, and love to a person who is ill or in need of company..,,,doesn't even have to be a dog,,,other animals are also theraputic|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	They go into hospitals and senior centers and keep people company.    My therapy dog goes into our local terminal children hospital and keeps them company. Most of the time he gets up on the bed and sleeps with them, but other times he plays fetch with them in the children's center or just puts his feet on their bed and keeps them company.     Each dog has his or her own specialty, my friends therapy dog works with senior citizens in nursing homes.
OGLulBtwaa	havanese.. my mom has a havapoo he's really cute and has a unique personality and if you want the kind of dog that's in love with you pick a havanese.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	American Pit Bull is the best way to go; i own one and he is muscular ...they need a lot of exercise like any ohter dog and they are good guard dogs|`|MLC97M1Baa	Havenese. They are great little dogs and I think would suit you. Try agility with the little guy, it would be a hoot.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	My personal preference would be the APBT.. There are thousands of APBT in shelters. I love the breed.    But you and your family need to make a decision as a whole.   This will be a family dog, and your whole family needs to agree.|`|xNhNRJrBaa	Havanese|`|vw7ebwgnaa	Pit Bulls need A LOT of room to live comfortably!! If you live near a large park or open area it may be ok...but since you are living with four siblings plus parents, an apartment may be pretty tight for a pit bull of any sort. If you do go the pit bull way, make sure you immediately place it in obedience training, and make sure the ENTIRE family participates so the dog gets sound punishment/structure!    A Havanese is great with people, esp. kids which is great in your case.  They are on the smaller side, so it would fit more comfortably in an apartment.    I personally am more of a pit bull fan (I grew up with pit bulls and I currently have a two year old pit bull terrier.    Good luck deciding!!|`|15b48876ffd5505969947c3bfe59eb00aa	If you like Havanese, you would really love a Sheltie !!!!|`|xPxm8ONiaa	I would suggest a Havanese. Pit Bulls are harder to manage. They are very strong breeds and not recommended for apartment life.

B6zl0AJDaa	Full QH Bars are made for a WIDE horse not a TB!  Your best bet would be a semi QH barred treed saddle and for your seat size, deduct two inches from your english seat size for your western saddle.  If you're riding in a 17.5 inch english saddle, then a 15.5 inch seat for western would be appropriate.|`|hEXb1unraa	No...full quarter bars is wide.....for a horse with wide shoulders and low withers or mutton withers....you would want a semi quarter bars.....this is for a horse with more of a withers and less bulk in the shoulders.|`|XsBIITFvaa	My appendix has full QH bars and he's built more like a TB, so yes, that does sound right to me.
8cikAYp3aa	dont try to 'starve him into eating".  Box turtles will go into partial hibernation awaiting food they are more inclined to eat.. if it never comes they just get weaker etc.    what you need to do is chop the kale/ carrots  what ever very very fine,  I use a small chopper and mince it.   then add 1 tsp of it well mixed into finely choped food that he likes or loves.. so he cant pick out the kale.    my boy loves bananna's to the exclusion of everything else.  I have to chop other veggies to get him to eat them.. Also  baby food mixes are quite good and both of my box's will eat it.|`|PSiNv7gUaa	Box turtles are omnivorous.  It's fine to feed fruits and veggies, but they also need animal protein.  Try feeding him mealworms, earthworms, crickets (either pre-killed crickets, or I usually stick a bag of live crickets in the freezer for a few minutes so they stop moving), etc.|`|aZxThVoYaa	Starve him until he eats it.  A healthy animal won't die of starvation.|`|KCKq9duJaa	go to a pet store they can help you.   maybe crickets thats what my lizards eat.  they are sorta like turtles.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	had one a long time ago  but anyway dog  food &  cat food  chicken  gizzets (boil them)   chop meat  my mom would take the insides of chicken& turkey (they're in a bag)  & Goliath (turtle's name) ate it all plus our  pets' food|`|UMg1CL7baa	i used to make my turtle a salad, with lettuce, carrots, and other greens, but what she really liked was strawberries.

Blend it and make a juice out of them and they will drink it up!!!|`|9bWLzwHjaa	I have a turtle too he don't like vegies either , but I did find out that as long as your pet eats fruit and meat that will give him the same amount of energy as vegies would so you don't have to feed him vegies.|`|ybf1g89jaa	You can trick your tort into eating vegetables.  Stop feeding the tort only fruits.....All Box turtles love to eat worms, cut the worm (large Canadian Night Crawlers) into small pieces and lay on whatever you want your tort to eat.  Once he/she starts they will just continue to eat.  You may have to do this a couple of times.
AA11088462	You can try to train her from doing things you dislike by spraying her with a little water.   It won't hurt her and cats dislike water, so they usually get the hint.  Some just have to grow out of it though.|`|t0mb150gaa	She could be doing it because she is just a kitten(kinda like a baby teething) so she may grow out of it when she gets older. Having chew toys and things like that around are good but if you want her to stop doing it to humans then you can try using a spray bottle filled with water and give her a spray  every time she does it.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Don't spray anything nasty on her.  Just pick her up.  Place her down away from you and get up and walk away. When she gets a little older she'll stop anyway.  It's a kitten thing. Adult cats don't do that.|`|6eIBIOwoaa	No. Tap on the nose. Or get BITTER apple and spray it in her mouth when she bites...|`|jYOXDthHaa	You could try using a spray bottle to gently squirt her when she bites.  This works to deter most cats from bad habits.  I don't know a lot about kittens, but a spray bottle worked wonders in training my 3 year-old cat to stop many bad habits (biting cardboard/plastic, humping furniture, etc) - I sprayed him in the back, usually, and he blames the spray bottle, not me, which is another plus.
AA10029366	Siberians were developed to live outdoors in winter temperatures averaging -30 F. It's never that cold in Utah. Your dog would be fine.    I would, however, be very concerned about leaving a Siberian outside alone. Siberians are team dogs. They are used to living in packs. If there are no other dogs outside with them, the human beings INSIDE the house are their "pack".    If you leave a Siberian outside alone, it will become lonely and bored, which means noisy and destructive. It will attempt to escape your yard in order to find entertainment and company. THIS is what you need to think about before you get one. If it's going to spend the majority of its time outside alone, it won't be happy...and neither will your neighbors, your yard, or the exterior of your house.|`|Qk3oflwPaa	my roomie has a siberian husky mixed w/ wolf & its a indoor dog but once outside she likes to take off!!(might be the wolfie in her) & yeah she'd be pretty lonely if it weren't for neighboring dogs 2 play w/. so if i were to get one (of my own) i'd have ta get a fence around my yard instead of a kennel ours is pretty active & loves to play.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	I grew up with two huskies. They will tell you when it's too cold outside for them. Dont be surprised if they dont want to come inside. Our huskies WANTED to be outside. They hated the nights we MADE them come inside. They had a nice dog house and of course there were two of them out back together. My dad made them a door into the side of the garage so they had somewhere to go when/if they got cold. It never happened.     Although the guy under me is VERY correct!! These dogs dug under the fence all the time. And they ate all of the plants in the back yard, including 8 rose bushes!!     They need an amazing amount of exercise! Huskies arent one of those dogs you can chain up in the back yard. You will have a mote in the back yard if you do. We had a huge back yard and my father would run 5 miles with each of them everyday.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Aww, why would you want the poor thing living outside with no contact with people and no love? That's just mean to the dog..he deserves a home where he will be part of the family.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	bad idea to leave them outside... not to mention theyre MOSTLY known as being escape artist...as in theyll find ANY way to escape|`|Re576Xa5aa	hello*    huskies were bred for outside artic tempuratures, make a insulated dog house(or fill it with hay) for those extreme utah conditions. Look on this site, I know your not a dog sledder but it has tips for out door dogs http://www.sleddogcentral.com/tips/index...    and you probably should have two huskies, huskies are pack animals, and youll need a fence with stone under it.|`|k2IIZkA3aa	Huskies are very closely related to wolves, and thus have a high pack-like mentality. They need companionship. I would not keep one outside.|`|gMNXzDa0aa	Well they can't LIVE outside but they can like be out there then come in.|`|FQnF8it2aa	I have a one year only Husky and she is crazy. If you are going to have a Husky outdoors I would suggest making sure there is NO way for them to get out! They are expert diggers and she even jumps pretty high as well! Make sure your yard is fenced in good because once they get out it will be hours before you catch up to them!     Besides that, I can't imagine having my Husky outdoors all the time. Huskies love attention and can get very destructive if they do not get enough! If you are going to have a Husky and keep him outside make sure that you spend plenty of time outside with him. And please make sure he has some sort of house that he can use as a den! Huskies especially love the security of their den!|`|ZddQ0XHmaa	why are you getting a dog if she is going to live outside?|`|UwplbhSsaa	While siberian huskies are a pretty durable breed, I would not recommend having any dog (no matter what the breed) as an outside dog. Dogs are social creatures and need to be part of a pack to become well adjusted. I don't want to come off as rude, but you seriously need to consider why you are getting a dog if you don't want intend it to be part of your family.
IIktclhcaa	This is called an umbilical hernia, it is very common in puppies and is easily repaired during the normal spay procedure when they are around 6 months old. I don't know if you are planning to have her spayed but it would be a wise choice now that you have noticed this defect.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	idk look it up|`|9Y56hQRlaa	I know this isnt any help but.... Dogs have belly buttons??|`|bPgvMO98aa	Have your vet look at it.  It could be an umbilical hernia.|`|AA11193920	Sounds like an umbilical hernia. Depending on the size, it could be an issue, or not.    If you are dealing with a bump the size of a dime or smaller, I really wouldn't worry about it. If it is larger than that, then there is an issue.    Either way, it can easily be repaired when you take her in for her spay surgery.
LPEO6AsCaa	Yes it sure can!  Your vet if he can do it can tell you where she is in her heat by doing this test.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes it can.    Now that being said, if you're not working with a breed mentor, showing/working/competing with your dog, doing any kind of genetic clearances already have homes lined up found a suitable stud who's been tested as well etc etc then  yes you are just throwing two dog's together.    Skip this heat and go find a breed mentor IF you re serious about breeding.
D1beU6MPaa	Ginger snaps!  I had this problem with one of mine and this is what my vet recommended. Works like a charm. You can buy them in the grocery store, but do not buy the iced ones. Just get the regular ones. They are found in the cookie isle. Before you put her in the car, give her two or three of them. I sware by them. Good luck|`|m4uDn0ofaa	Your vet can prescribe you something to give to your puppy.  Do not give her any human medicine.|`|fQgbBx7caa	some pepto bismol....|`|SMFhXxcfaa	are you giving her food before her trip in the car?  I would not give her food a couple hours before you go for a ride.  I would also do lots of shot rides to get her use to it.  The vet will know what can be given to a puppy and if its even necessary|`|MLC97M1Baa	NO PEPTO BISMOL.    It is very common in puppies. I had this problem myself with mine, and asked my vet about it. He said to gradually increase the amount of time the dog spent in the car, and get him used to it. It is the safest way possible.|`|Qc0x3Ldaaa	Since the pup is so young, she will probably outgrow it.  You'll need to take her on short rides and gradually increase the time.    There are a few dogs that never outgrow car sickness.  In that case, your vet can give you a prescription that will calm her down, and usually make her sleep, so she doesn't get sick in the car.    Do not give her anything over the counter without your vet's approval.|`|cR7DXFeLaa	um idk about medicine but my dog gets car sick and i jst comfort and talk to him because they just get scared|`|rmgcAwKdaa	It takes time for a puppy or any dog to adjust to car rides. there not to keen on them. Maybe a half of a Tum or a quarter of one. or just ride it out and lay out a towel and have back ups and whippies for clean up. Dont feed before rides. wait a hour (like swimming) before rides to start.|`|5b697ae5264bc19d33f3ae5c96b9fb0caa	First of all, you don't need to be giving a 9 week old puppy car rides. The puppy is way to young to wag it around in public. There is enough time for this when they get older. Your puppy should stay at home, until it finishes its shots. There are too many tings out there a little puppy can pick up. Parvo is a killer. Please keep your little baby at home, until it is through with its shots. I would call your vet before you take it there to see if they are housing a sick dog. Don't let your puppies feet touch the floor when you take it in to see the vet.
b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Yes.  Your local garden shop sells those.  They're supposed to eat other snails.  Probably one of your neighbors bought some.    Here in Southern California those things are sold at OSH.  You'll find them right next to the live ladybugs.
B6zl0AJDaa	Boarding out can run anywhere from $100.00/mo to $1,000.00/mo depending upon the facility. IF you live in a populated city like San Francisco or Los Angeles, boarding close to home will more than likely run on the higher end. This provides stalls, cleaning, bedding and hay twice a day.     The lower end, is probably out in the rual areas and can be with hay or without (You'd have to go out twice a day and feed your horse (s).    I suggest that you call around to the boarding stables in your area and get rates and facilities (Does it have an arena, round pen, hot walker, wash rack, etc.).    The costs of shavings vary from place to place. In LA right now, a 5 cubic yard bag of shavings runs $4.00 from the shavings company and can run as high as $7.00 in a tack store. You also need sand, decomposed granite and sweet lime to keep your stalls bedded correctly. The sand and dg you'll have to call and get pricing on.    Then there's the additional costs:  Hay in CA right now is running $18.95/bale for 3 strand alfafa which weighs 100LBs plus. Oat hay, runs a couple of bucks cheaper. Your horse will need between 5 and 7.5 bales a month, depending upon how easy a keeper your new horse is.    Shoeing (Which can run anywhere from $50.00 for just shoes in the front and barefoot in the back on up.) Done about every 6 to 8 weeks.  Trims: About $35.00 Once again done every 6 to 8 weeks.    Grain: Depending upon how easy a keeper your horse is, a bag of grain will run you about $15.00 and bran about the same, once a month.    Vet: Now normally without any accidents, once, twice a year for shots which run $40.00 per shot and the 'call charge' which can range depending upon your area from $40.00 all the way up to $250.00!    Misc. Tack: This is the one that not only can get expensive, BUT addicting! You see something that your horse just MUST have! DO NOT go to ebay! This can be VERY costly and addicting, trust me on this I have a friend who's still paying off credit cards from ebay horsey things she bought.  As for tack, figure between $500.00 and $1,000.00 to start and that will get you your saddle, pad and bridle.    Having someone trailer or haul your horse with the cost of gas would probably be $2.00/mile nowadays...    Okay, now you have your catagories, work up a spreadsheet for your area and then see if you can afford to own a horse.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	vet is about 500 a year for vaccines and routine care, more in some areas. For 500 you can insure your horse incase theres major medical issues like broken legs or colic, its just a good idea to do.    Farrier is about 60 a pop for trimming, more for shoes. every other month or so.    boarding is usually 250-500 for full board, including turn out and feed.    Feed is about 25 a bag. which lasts usually a week or so, depending. Hay is about 3 bucks a bale.    you can easily spend 1000+ on supplies and tack without even trying, but those will last for years if theyre cared for properly.|`|HE558QgXaa	It can cost thousands of dollars to keep a horse. Make sure you consider boarding, feed, tack, upkeep, and vet bills. It will add up very fast so make sure you have a few thousand set aside for your horse and emergency vet care. Also keep in mind that horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports there is, so make sure you have money for the hospital in case something happens to you|`|psNR7hDJaa	Theres tons of price ranges. It depends on where you board and if you need shoes, etc. I will show you the prices i have to pay though...     Board: $225 - full board, includes turnout in the paddock during the day, feed, water, cleaning of stall and going in at night     Farrier: $30 - My horse goes barefoot and so we just get trims every 5-8 weeks.     Vet: That one it depends. I had to get a west nile shot and some other one and that was about $200 i think...(i forget now).     Care supplies: Well my saddle was $300 and it came with a bridle, it was a nice used saddle. But I might get this other one now as that saddle doesn't fit 100% well(I don't use it anymore, i am borrowing my aunt's saddle that fits her). Grooming supplies will probably be a max of $20. Feed, it depends. In one of my last year's shows, i won a bag. :)|`|XsBIITFvaa	too much =C|`|ysJusb21aa	It costs me $285 a month for board at a place with an arena, stabled nightlly and good people to watch over him.  I pay $20 a month for horse pellets.   $10 for deworming every other month.  I do routine dental once a year at $150.  Shots and sheath cleaning come to about $200 a year. Gas costs a lot to travel to trails.  A starter trailer can be bought for around $1000.  The farrier is 80 every other month.  You could set up for riding tack and helmut for under $1000.  My horse was given to me.  I learned real quick that there is no such thing as a free horse.  I used to have a new car every 4 years.  My horse is my car payment now.|`|DmUG33axaa	a lot. I live in michigan and have 20. Its about $40 every 6 weeks for a ferrier (if their feet are good) hay is about $5 a bail if you live in an area without a hay shortage. boarding can be anywhere from $200 or way more, depending on your area. feed is about 20 dollars for a 50 pound bag, tack, 500 for a decent saddle, bits can get pricy, boots.. vet about $100+ for a farm call(just for them showing up), plus vacinations. if your horse is injured its VERY expensive. if your hard up for money .. don't get a horse. and don't buy a baby or some brood mare that has been out to pasture for forever, you can find cheaper horses that are badass because the market is so bad, but be smart. if you really want one do your research. it depends on what you are really looking for do you want to  (barrel race, show in pleasure, dressage, jumping, or just trail ride)|`|p2uX8tMbaa	it depends on where your keeping it. If it's at your house then the food and hay will cost you.         But if your boarding it then you have to ask the people how much are boarding. A horse has to at two times a day and needs hay.{if you don't have grass}   Hope this helped|`|AA11675726	A lot depends on how big a horse you get - say a 15 hand one will eat a lot less that a 19 hand one.  And it depends on where you live - how hard it is to get hay (the  big round bales here cost anywhere from $45 to $65, delivered).  The farrier here charges $45 per visit - about every 6 weeks - shots and coggins testing depends again on the vet you select.  The daily feed (good quality horse feed ie Strategy) depends on where you buy your food and if there is a horse feed outlet nearby.  How much land do you have?  Could the horse graze?  Could he/she be moved from one area to another to prevent over grazing?    What it comes down to:  Horses are expensive.  If you really are convinced that you would ride him/her daily (horses need to work to be happy) and that you would do the grooming that is required, then get your horse.  If this is just a thought and it doesn't really mean that you will spend time with the horse, then just rent one to ride when you desire to ride.|`|ngo1pmlGaa	well i have a thoroughbred gelding and we board him at a barn... the board itself i about 500 a month, plus lessons is like another 75-85 a month. Farrier depends if the horse needs shoes or not, my horse doesnt so its less. For the Vet, again it depends on the horse if he is allergic to things or is sensitive to things!. Feed, if you board, most barns dont charge much for that but if the horse needs special suppliments (my horse is on cosaqin and electrolites) then they can cost anywhere from 120-230 usually. and care supplies includes brushes,saddle,bridle,halter,leadrope,bo... line,crop etc..., then of couse your gonna wanna buy your pony treats! so idk you do the math!|`|cOVZ5Gh2aa	Well, if you ask anyone with a horse chances are, if you ask them how much does it cost, they will probably say the cheapest part about keeping a horse is the horses cheapest part. you have to pay depending on the brand and Feed Not including the the cost of the horse, tack, or training; If you own your property, it costs about 100 dollars per month per horse. That includes hay, shots, and grain/dewormer.     As far as the tack goes; halters are generally between 15-40 dollars, depending on whether the saddle and blankets are new or used, western or english, the price varies between 100-150 dollars all the way up to tens of thousands of dollars (for a custom show saddle). My preference is for used, broken in saddles, which generally run from 100-500 dollars a piece.     If you get a used saddle, often times people will throw in the blanket for free. A new blanket costs around 80-100 dollars for a nice one. You want one made with a genuine sheep-skin liner to wick away the sweat on the horse. There is also lead ropes, bits, fly masks, etc etc to consider price-wise.     If you don't own your own property; I am not sure about monthly boarding, however I believe it runs between 40-600+ dollars, depending on where you live (city, suburban, country, etc).    Horses in general tend to be very expensive to keep, but if you have the right home for them; they are SO worth it. :)|`|PdG8tIGQaa	well the actual horse will probably be 2,000 - 5,000 $$$$ but the tack and the grain and the hay and the shaving together will probably cost like 10,0000 $$$$ lol.    probably not but i think im close!  but remember that you need to refill the grain and shavings and hay! so it cost a lot of $$$$$ hope i helped ! ;-)
apUkTo3maa	PROBABLY BECAUSE HE  CANT EVER SEEM TO REACH THAT CERTAIN SPOT.... IN OUR FAMILY WE CALL IT THE SWEET SPOT... WHEN OUR PUG DOES THAT|`|fpuPRNlWaa	It tickles him and he likes it so much.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	Because he is really likes that place scratched.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Well when he is looking up he is saying THANK HEAVENS HE FOUND THE SPOT!!|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Because that is A part of his body that he can't reach Because his legs won't let him so when you hit it it's like OHH MYYY GOOOD this is the best MAN/WOMAN every. AKA his Good Spot,Fave Spot whatever they call it! oyhh and he also kicks his leg Because imagine if you coudlnt sctrach that surtine spot on you back or something THEN when somone hit it you flex you finger thats their way of doing it! My dog got ran over and had to have a hip replacement and a pin in both her legs Now she can't scratch so she Rolls on the grass to do it and right on her neck if you scratch it she Goes A kickin her lil heart Out LOL      hope this helps|`|DyZreluEaa	He likes the place you are scratching. Dogs tend to do that.|`|yE7ugLuyaa	It`s a spot that is impossible for him to scratch,and it fels good|`|PWamfb8paa	they just want to express what they're feeling.|`|AHYO3cZNaa	apparently he likes the spot very much. but yea most animals do that. mine do. its common
ZAljSeERaa	it sounds like they are pin feathers (new feathers coming in) my birds will come over to me and have me pull the shaft off of them to let the feather out lol dont worry tho if you get a sore on cuz some are still boold feathers and if they hurt your bird will turn around and kinda nip at your finger and make a small noise if he does that just go to the next one mine will let me do this forever they end up falling asleep its like humans playing with each others hair kinda!! lol it wond hurt him unless you get a blood feather and keep messing with it til you break it down to far on the shaft and the feather will bleed and will not stop til you pull that feather but they really let you know if its a blood feather (WARNING picking at the pin feather is addicting lol)|`|Oii9H4g6aa	do you know if he has mites or not??because mites make their faces and feet scaly and crusty. or maybe his feathers are just changing or he's molting. hope  i helped ;)|`|rkJv14yaaa	his feathers are probably just growing in. it should be gone in a couple weeks, if it's not, then contact a vet|`|fQ3d5iAWaa	Well i had same problem with my parakeet and later it turned out that his new feathers were growing. SO i think there is no need to worry, in a week or so it should be gone and new feathers will appear. But if it doesn't go away in lets say two weeks than you need to contact your vet.
z5WbH7Yfaa	shelter. if you can't afford vet bills and food and stuff then you can't get the dog.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Google "beagle rescues New Jersey", you'll have more beagles than you have room for.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	You really should check the pound or local shelter.  Believe it or not there are alot of purebreds that end up in there. No you don't get the AKC paper but you will save a life.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	Look on the AKC website to look up breeders. Also you can call around to local veterinarians. A good breeder will be known by a vet. According to the book The Dog Bible beagles have the health concerns of "cleft palate, demodectic mange, dwarfism, epilepsy, eye problems, hip displaysia, hypothyroidism, intervertebral disc disease, luxating patellas, and reproductive disorders. Check around to see which ones are the most tested for, ie hip displaysia, and make sure the parents have been tested. Good Luck finding your new puppy.

UGh.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	The word "stud" automatically places the question in the dogs section.    Its been three weeks, so you should be okay to change it provided you don't have any type of lumps or hard areas on or around the piercing.    Here is a website that may help you:  http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/articles/p...|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Ummm....  This is in the 'dog' section why?  When mine was done, I was instructed to leave the original stud in for 90 days while it fully healed.  Did your piercer not go over aftercare with you, including when you could change the stud?|`|16XpYCBmaa	You should wait at leaset 4 to 6 weeks so when you change the stud so it won't grow back shut to fast.|`|44137dc73f9d5ddff50d1edf6ab37668aa	i would wait 12 weeks      i waited 6 weeks and when i took it out it started to close so i had to shove the new one back threw and boy did that ever hurt!!
RN1wGlWWaa	I have no clue, but ours do that in the house.  You go around looking everywhere and calling for them.  All of a sudden they come out of a room or hallway where you've looked.    If you figure it out, let me know too :)|`|P9K7AYmWaa	sometimes i think this.. maybe its true|`|b7sj5YlNaa	What does it matter? He came back.|`|kXZtPZFjaa	My 3 cats do the same thing all da time
aCqSF87Raa	He sounds pretty smart, actually! He managed to pick up that not touching the hand gets him the treat. <br>  <br>  That method is how we taught our dog (through Petsmart training) to "leave it." When our dogs did the same our trainer had us put the treat UNDER our hand on the floor and repeat the process. Then on our open palm on the floor, then just on the floor using the verbal cue as soon as the dog made a move for it.<br>  <br>  Try that, you may impress your trainer next class!<br>  <br>  PS - I assume by "off" you're trying to teach the dog to not pick up an item or object? We used the command "off" to teach our dogs to not jump up (as "down" was used to teach the lay down command.)|`|pF4WAmHYaa	that's probably what he is supposed to do|`|A21SswSfaa	If he's sitting nicely and waiting for a treat then that's appropriate behavior. My dogs automatically sit when I pull out the clicker. Maybe he's just a quick learner. But as long as he's polite and sitting, click the clicker and give him a treat.|`|nTJLpb6raa	Yer that's what I did with my dog then I trained it to sit and lie down for the treat
XB0UpJsLaa	arabs can be good at everything...they r mostly endurance ..but I show my arab in english, dressage, jumping, and western pleasure. They r also used for saddle seat a lot. My arab is mostly english, but my friend has one who is REALLY good at western pleasure  and can trot slower than half the quarter horses. and about contesting..I know four people that do contesting with there arab. My friend qualified for state in barrel racing with her arabian. And next year I am planning to do barrels and poles with my horse. Good Luck--I hope u get her she sounds very pretty!!|`|FLBCvJuDaa	In Arabia- hence the name- they are bred for endurance.  Check out the movie "Hidalgo".|`|xLNzdxsOaa	There is Arab racing, and Arabs also excel at endurance riding. I've never tried barrel racing but I think Arabs are pretty much good at anything they put their minds to. And my arab doesn't have much of a dished face, not all arabs do.|`|ArtZzDU8aa	They were bred for endurance racing.  - not all arabs havbe dished faces, ever pure bred (thank god).|`|XL62syrCaa	I owned an Arabian mare and she was SO versatile! She loved to run (was bordering on run crazy) and she loved barrels! Also they have more stamina (can do longer barrel shows with less rest). And yes they race Arabians in Egypt. The Arabic people base their lives off of these horses and race them consistently (they actually look down on our "western" breeds such as the thoroughbred and quarter horses).     Now do be aware: They are very intelligent (can outsmart their riders lol) and need consistent exercise (because they are so high strung) and form a very close attachment to their riders (to the point of becoming one rider horses).     And if you have a good one they can look at food and gain weight!.     Good Luck|`|5TCewPYRaa	No---arabians are NOT good barrel racers---they get wired on speed and psycho....Arabs are basically only great at endurance---its what they were originally bred for---desert trekking---so keep it that way...I have watched way too many girls try to make Arabs barrel horses cuz they think they're fast---but they are flighty and stupid when it comes to barrel racing---they just get fried faster than any other breed i've watched compete in barrels---arabs and TBs get fried and psycho the fastest.  They quickly become a danger to other riders, ring crew, themselves and their rider....its not a good combo...      Some can be decent at other events too...but they are well-known for endurance---please dont try to barrel race this mare--it WILL end badly for you....plus they dont have the short quick speed thing that other breeds like QHs do...they are meant for endurance---their barrel times arent really all that great---they aren't meant for it|`|OKKfyLnlaa	Endurance racing is their strong point, but you can do all but pro barrel racing on them (they just don't have quite the "zero to sixty" power of your pro barrel racing horses).  They jump, do dressage, gaming, you name it.  You can do anything you want with an Arabian, especially events that require a lot of stamina.  I have 22 year old half-Arab, and he puts all the youngsters to shame on trail rides.  I credit that to his people pleasing, tough, get up and go Arabian side!  Have fun with her!|`|1oOGAY8caa	Arabians excel in pretty much everything out there! Haha. But they were bred for endurance races. They are amazingly surefooted and can tackle anything like that. Maybe you should look into some competitive trail rides / endurance rides in your area.|`|ExUN7srRaa	they were bred for endurance|`|CsC2xqM9aa	Arabians are famouse for their looks and stamina. They are great at show jumping and sometime dressage i dont know about barrel racing since they are not really bred western but maybe she has a natural talent in it like other horses|`|AA11171398	Your can use her in what ever you like. I personally find that they are EXELLENT reining horses. They are usually used in endurance races, and they are becoming popular in show humping along side the morgan.|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	I have 2 Arabians. Marli won several barrel races for her former owner. She also won several halter shows. Her sire (Almas Al Nisr) was a racer that won about $1,000,000 during his career before being retired from the track. Steve Diamond then entered him in Western Pleasure and he won several events there.    As for being "crazy", she is one of the calmest horses. She has a very people-pleaser attitude.

vbEkYH2haa	If its fluffed up most  of the time it means it is stressed or sick. Seeing you only got it saturday i would say its stressed about being in its new home and needs more time to adjust.     How are its poos? are they green or sticking to the feathers around its vent (bottom)? If they are then he may not be eating or may be getting sick.      Keep a close eye on your new little bird and be ready to take him to the vet if you need to.|`|v6coHbIeaa	I know you said the heater was on, but what is the temp were the bird is at.

CekrjtEhaa	I have both a Pessoa and a Crosby.  The Pessoa I have is a Nelson Pessoa made in England (from what I understand that is an older model) and it is really good quality and fits my thoroughbreds very well.  I have had it for almost three years and it still looks nice and it broke in easily.  The Crosby I have is a Hunterdon.  It too is a good saddle, fits just about any horse.  The Crosby leather is tough, and to be honest it took a little while for it to break in.  But, it has certainly lasted!  Both are close contact saddles with no knee rolls or padding of any nature (I'm 'old school') so all the new saddles I can't stand as there is too much padding!!  However, either saddle should work well for you as long as it fits your horse and you.  Good luck in your saddle purchase, there is nothing better than the 'new saddle smell'!|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	I personally like the Crosby better! It's more comfy and fits my TB better!!!|`|AA10397687	crosby|`|AQaz64Cpaa	Whatever fits your horse best, not your own ***.    If your horse is comfortable, it will be a much better ride and you'll adjust to the new saddle. It's like selecting one of those really large backpacks for people who backpack around countries. Your friend can have it perfectly adjusted for him, and it will be super comfortable for him.... then when you put it on it will be all wrong.    Think of a saddle as a super heavy backpack for you, only unadjustable.
G0KKfXMUaa	Well, use a crop. I don't suggest spurs because they tend to make a horse get VERY fast.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sit down deep in your seat, straight up and tall. Heels DOWN. Kick him a firm kick, and tap him on the shoulder with a crop, and say a low, yet firm, "caaanterrr". If he doesn't canter, tap harder with the crop. Eventually, he'll get the message.<br>  <br>  And remember to keep good contact between your leg and the horse.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I agree with gigs.  Use a crop lightly the first time since you don't know how he will react.  Try giving a squeeze with your legs first, if that doesn't work, give a kick, if that still doesn't get a reaction then use the crop.  Don't beat the horse though.  One tap should get something, If not repeat the above steps.  <br>  <br>  Also try clicking or kissing to the horse if he knows that cue.|`|TJKb1QDTaa	Yes, you should use a crop, and tap behind your leg slightly.  Another thing you should do is nudge your heels - not kicking though - with every stride he/she makes - if you know strides.  While you nudge and slightly tap the horse with a crop, make loud kissing noises to the horse until he/she canters.  If you can put a ground pole in one corner of the riding arena, begin to ask the horse to canter - while doing all movements above - as he/she is trotting over that pole.
8NSh1D4Maa	Generally no.  Your local animal shelters may have resources available that can help you find an alternate living situation for your pet while you get back on your feet, though.  Our local shelter here will care for them while the owner finds housing, for a limited amount of time.|`|e01asnTEaa	nope our friend had a dog and had to get rid of her...

I was sprayed once.  No way.  Not even for $1000.  I swear it is that darn bad.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Nope not at all.

MYEEK4dcaa	Start with leadership training.  Training yourself to be his leader, I mean.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  Make the dog work for everything.  Teach him how to sit, that's first, by holding a treat very close to but not touching his nose, and slowly move your hand to just over his head.  He'll have to sit down so he can look at the treat.  Give the command word, "sit." When he does sit, give him the treat immediately and praise him.  Do this again about 3 times, and do it 3 or 4 times during the day.  After he's learned it, don't give him anything - food, treats, toys, ANYTHING except water and potty breaks - unless he sits for it.  You will have to tell him to sit at first, but after a few weeks, all you'll have to do is present the award, and he'll sit happily all by himself.  This program is called NILIF (nothing in life is free) and you can look up the details on the nett.<br>  <br>  Next is exercise.  Teach the dog to heel by using a training collar and a leash.  Take him for a walk.  If he tries to pull ahead of you, turn around and walk the other way.  Do this until he decides it's better to stay with you than to try to wander off on his own, but no more than 40 minutes at a time, two or three times a day.  Within 4 days, he should be walking happily at heel.<br>  <br>  Then take him walking for an hour or so every day thereafter.  <br>  <br>  Now he's ready to go to an obedience class or to have you try to train him by using a book. <br>  <br>  For Leadership information (leadership has to come first - your dog has to trust and respect you as well as love you), read "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.  For specific training information, read "The Dog Listener" by Jan Fennell.  You may be able to get these books from the library if you can't afford to buy them.<br>  <br>  Remember that as the leader, you're in charge of everything.  You decide when your dog gets petted, when to feed him (should be at the same times of day every day), when to play with him, what toys he can have, when to walk him, and every thing else.  Be sure  your dog understands that before you start real obedience training.  Sit and Heel are the two most important commands you can teach a dog.  Once you get the books, there are lots of other commands you can teach a dog, and once you get the concept and philosophy down pat, you will be able to train your dog on your own without classes or books.<br>  <br>  Remember, too, that the dog needs lots of socialization with other people and other dogs.  That's one of the best reasons, I think, to take him to an obedience class.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  No dog is born with good manners. Pooping on the carpet, leaping enthusiastically onto guests, pulling so hard he practically yanks your arm out of the socket when on walks--that's all perfectly acceptable in the canine world. It's up to you to teach your dog to behave the way we humans want him to. Not training your dog and expecting him to be pleasant to live with is like never sending your child to school and expecting him to ace the SATs.<br>  here are some guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/training.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/training.html</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Your Local training club with an experienced trainer. Petsmart doesn't cut it their "certification" is basically just reading a book.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>|`|q0vKbocHaa	start with a basic obedience class. It will help with socization and give you ideas for basic obedience training on your own|`|A21SswSfaa	Start with obedience classes. It's a great way to socialize the dog and for your dog to start learning basic commands. But if the dog has had no prior training she may need some manners. I would even carry treats around the house with me and work on getting your dog's attention, redirecting her from bad things, and practice saying her name then giving her a treat. Then you can go from there.|`|GSf09ALBaa	With a good book.  It will guide you.  Or you can go on the internet and find all kinds of places that teach training.  <br>  <br>  You always want to start with the simple sit, down, stay.  You use treats as reward.<br>  <br>  Get a book, go for it.  And good for you for wanting to train.|`|aCqSF87Raa	What sort of training are you going for? Potty training? Manners (like no jumping?) Obedience? <br>  <br>  Either way, start small with easy to chew/swallow treats. I would also use a clicker - they're popular now and they mark a behavior a lot quicker than a verbal cue (IE you lead dog into sit and CLICK when butt hits floor - as opposed to "good dog" seconds after.)<br>  <br>  Keep training sessions small - a few minutes several times throughout the day with a good 20 minute session every few days. Incorporate as much of the training into your lives - like sitting for food or petting. End on a good note and make the sessions fun.
zqVDJxUIaa	First of all, it sounds like the gourami might have Columnaris, or cottony mouth disease. If not, there's no way of knowing, so I'd do the following:<br>  <br>  1. Perform 20-30% water changes every 2 days, remember to condition the water.<br>  2. Vacuum the gravel every time you do a water change as well.<br>  3. Add some aquarium salt, only a little (a teaspoon per gallon)<br>  4. Add QuickCure, a medication available at most pet stores.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Columnaris:<br>  Often mistaken for a fungal infection because of its mold-like lesions, Columnaris is a common bacterial infection in cultured fish, particularly livebearing fish and catfish. Its name is derived from columnar shaped bacteria, which are present in virtually all aquarium environments.<br>  The bacteria are most likely to infect fish that have been stressed by such conditions as poor water quality, inadequate diet, or handling and shipping. Columnaris can enter the fish through the gills, mouth, or via small wounds on the skin. The disease is highly contagious and may be spread through contaminated nets, specimen containers, and even food.<br>  Columnaris can be external or internal and may follow a chronic or acute course. Lesions in chronic cases progress slowly, taking many days before culminating in fish death. In acute cases the lesions spread quickly, often wiping out entire populations of fish within hours. High water temperatures accelerate the progression of the disease; however lowering the water temp will not affect the outcome of the disease.<br>  -Symptoms: White spots on mouth, edges of scales, and fins<br>  - Cottony growth that eats away at the mouth<br>  - Fins disintegrate beginning at the edges<br>  - 'Saddleback' lesion near the dorsal fin<br>  -Fungus often invades the affected skin<br>  -Rapid gilling in cases where gills are infected<br>  Most Columnaris infections are external, and present first as white or grayish white spots on the head, and around the fins or gills. The lesions may first be seen only as a paler area that lacks the normal shiny appearance. As the lesion progresses it may become yellowish or brownish in color and the area around it may be tinged red.<br>  <br>  Lesions on the back often extend down the sides, giving the appearance of a saddle. On the mouth the lesions may look moldy or cottony, and the mouth will become eaten away. Fins will erode and have a frayed appearance as the infection progresses. The gills filaments will disintegrate as the bacteria invade them, and the fish will begin breathing rapidly due to lack of oxygen. Less commonly, the infection will be internal, and display no external symptoms.<br>  - Treatment: Change water<br>  - Vacuum gravel<br>  - Add aquarium salt<br>  -Treat with copper sulfate or antibiotic<br>  - Discontinue carbon filtration during treatment<br>  External infections should be treated with antibiotics or chemicals in the water. Copper sulfate, Acriflavine, Furan, and Terramycin may all be used externally to treat Columnaris. Terramycin has proven to be quite effective both as a bath, and when used to treat foods for internal infections. Salt may be added to the water to enhance gill function. Livebearers in particular will benefit from the addition of salt, however use caution when treating catfish, as many are sensitive to salt.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're very concerned about the angelfish/gourami, you can separate them with a plastic divider.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  GOOD Luck!|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Listen to Nate , All I can tell you from breeding angelfish for 40 years is, once they zero in on a another fish with a problem they will bully it until they kill it.
Ey1Mb4FAaa	They is no kind way of doing it! but it good to see that you know about the males making good fathers and that female get stressed with out them, so i let you in on the way i breed my gerbils.    Put the male and female together, after the birth of the first litter dad stay and helps. When the pups are about 5 weeks old dad comes out and put on his own a long with a male pup. the other pups stay with mother who give birth to another litter as the old ones are about 6 weeks, You can now home the pups but keep one female with mom to help rise the new litter. Than when the new litter is 6 weeks home them too. This way mom and dad have company of the same-sex.    The other way is if you wish to breed the pair once and keep no pups, First find a vet that can neuter male gerbils. Put the male and female together, after the birth of the first litter have dad neutered and put him back in with mom! he take a day or two to recover but will soon be a great father. the chances are you will have a second birth soon and at 6 weeks home the first pups and repeat for the second. This way the two can stay together and and you will have no more pups.    Just a few thing make you the female is are 5 months old before that is not good for her to breed and after 6 months is bad for starting to breed too. male can breed when ever they feel like it. the reason not to get the male neutered till the birth is because it is very hard to tell if the gerbil is with pups are not. I after more than 15 litters (lose count) still get it wrong sometime if the female is just putting on wait.     I hope this helps. this is one of the easy (on the gerbils) way of breeding.    O and Gerbil live from about 2 to five years old some go a lot long I heard it records is 8 years old. Put that in you pipe Fred S and smoke!    I you have any question you can email me from My Profile page, just click on my name I welcome gerbil question from any one|`|j9IxYZF9aa	Just keep the father away fro the mother.Otherwise you will end with a Gerbil army.Mom can look after her babies quite well.Gerbils live about 2 years.And the are lots of fun.

Try putting the kongs into a plastic bag of their favorite treats for a month or so, until the kongs pick up the smell.  <br>  <br>  There are some good suggestions on the Yahoo dog groups for doing fun stuff with the dogs, like hiding toys or treats, to give them a little fun and excitement.

Try a lot of peanut butter, and get it wedged in there really good so that they REALLY have to try and concentrate to get it out. And dogs love liver, too.

z5GwTXx6aa	Food, Water, bedding and toys.  I have a 3 legged hamster also and she gets around just fine.  Good Luck**|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    One of my favorite *ever* pet hamsters was Tripod (yeah yeah, I know, the corniest 3 legged animal name on earth).    He had NO idea he didn't have 4 legs.  His brother Linus was his buddy.  He could out climb, outrun, and just about do everything *better* than Linus could!    He ran on his wheel, he climbed the cage bars, he did everything a normal hamster will and can do.    Yours won't even know he's "hamstercapped."  Treat him like you would any other hamster :)    Hamsters can sense how we feel, and are reactionary.  Act like normal and he'll do the same.    Enjoy your new friend - and wtg on the rescue - I wish there were more people out there willing to help in cases like this :)|`|XrMMH5tZaa	like everyone said treat him like normal and dont get rid of his wheel, they need  the exercise.    instead of a wire wheel  get a plastic one like this  nothing to get caught in!  http://www.amazinganimal.co.uk/hamster-w...      and give him lotsa love like all hammys need!|`|eS8wuYRfaa	I would say to just set everything up like you would for a 4 legged hamster..except a wheel.  I hate those things anyway.  Way too many hamsters and gerbils get hurt on them.  Plenty of soft bedding for him to nest in, plenty of food and water and he should live a normal life span.|`|I6KKFwxXaa	I had one that was born with half of his front leg and he did fine with everything and even ran on his wheel but he loved his ball and bit me twice because I tried to take him out of it. toilet paper rolls and lots of attention hold him a lot and play with him. A dog I rescued tried to eat the hamster so I gave him to a class of special needs children and they loved it.|`|va8xvhthaa	I'd like to thank you for adopting. Not many people do that!! Treat him like a 4 legged hamster, with no wheel. Let him run around a hamster-safe area, and he'll be fine. Good luck!!!|`|6zXg6DRIaa	yogurt drops|`|pK89Yh4Eaa	omg, feel so bad 4 tha little guy|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	well, kudos to you for adopting a handicapped hamster, you should be proud.  I'm sure your hamster already feels great about his new home, but give him some treats and buy a nice igloo for him, no exercise wheels though. Just take good care of him, and eventually buy him a mate or a friend, so he can be happy and never be lonely.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	We have "Tripod" - Tripod is a campbells dwarf hamster missing one complete back leg and one foot on the other back leg. Kid who wants to be a vet saved it as a baby when it was being destroyed shortly after birth. Amazingly, it lived; I was doubtful it  could learn to walk if it even survived. She does fine with the other hamsters and is now several months old.    NEVER breed her. This isn't a birth defect which would preclude breeding, but an injury; you still wouldn't want to risk a complicated delivery.    Good quality pellet food (like mazuri) and seed mix (like nutriphase gold) - this would NOT include yogurt junk food sweet crap. Hamsters don't visit the local yogurt stand in the wild. Especially because of her injuries, you want the best and healthiest diet possible for healing.     A SAFE cage - bin cage or aquarium so there is no chance of getting stuck in bars.     A SAFE solid bottom wheel - silent spinner, comfort wheel and woodent wheel all have solid bottoms. Be sure he can get into a woodent wheel if you use that one - the front isn't completely open like the others. For tripod, we have to bury the stand of the wheels slighly in the bedding, so she can climb on easier - she runs just fine - getting on the wheel is the problem for her. As a second wheel for variety, you can use one of the flying saucer types - this should never be your only wheel. ANY wheel you get should allow your hamster to run without arching it's back. Most wheels are too small - especially those that come in cages.    3 legged hamsters DO need a wheel as much as their 4 legged friends. PLEASE don't deprive them of the needed exercise this provides. Hamsters can travel miles at night in the wild - even the largest cages we have comes no where close to the amount of space the truly need. The wheel is our closest substitute to this. Depriving hamsters of this (as long as they can safely use it) is cruel.     During the actual healing of the leg injury, you don't want a wheel in the cage.     As you know, NO hamster should ever be on a wheel with rungs - the risk of injury or amputation is too great. Anyone who currently has this type of wheel should weave cardboard (cut up a cereal box if you have nothing else) thru the rungs until you can get it replaced with a proper safe wheel.    SAFE bedding - Aspen, Carefresh     Watch the stump of the injury - if it's still healing neosporin is helpful. When fully healed still keep an eye on the stump, depending on how he adapts to walking it may never touch the ground or he'll walk on the stump and develop a callous.You're basically watching to make sure he doesn't ever reopen the callous.     Cagemates - if it's a syrian it's a non issue as they have to live alone anyways. If it's a dwarf type, he might be happier with others of his same sex and species, BUT you have to make sure he wouldn't get bullied. Don't attempt to introduce him to others with a still open injury, but after it's all healed and he's adapting it might be possible. Our tripod lives in one cage with cagemates, but also visits the others with out any problems. It really depends on the personalities of your hamsters.    Tubes - think carefully about these - the chance of falling is greater if you don't have all your limbs. Also some tube have a bubble design inside which isn't terrrible smooth and could be irritating on the stump. A better alternative would be a bin cage with a paper towel tube or two inside it in addition to the other regular stuff.    Large enough cage to exercise in a safe way. Again, this brings us back to a bin cage or long aquarium. Nothing with bars to climb and get another limb stuck in.
z5GwTXx6aa	You can train them to.  My SAR dog will go in any direction I point.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	Both of my dogs understand that when I am pointing in a direction it means to, at the very least, look that way. Or, to pick up the treat or go in that direction, etc.    So yes some dogs do understand this. But, it is a learned behavior- not something that comes naturally.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	It depends on what you've trained them.  My dog will look in the direction I am pointing or get the object I am pointing at.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	One of my dogs just looks at my finger with this really blank look when I point.

So in my case, yes.   When I say " go to your place " , I point stating the dog to go to its mat.|`|M0wwRbPAaa	Ummmmm some doggs do and some don't.  Our dogs if you point like from the living room to the hall way they will look in the hall way and sometimes go look for something.|`|opjYENGGaa	You can train dogs to understand hand gestures. Not all will understand what you mean if you just point and don't teach them what you mean.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Yes, I can point to the bed and my dog will go, or point outside and my dog will go...she's deaf it's the only form of communication she can understand.|`|TYxUM1PYaa	Holding my palm parallel to the floor, or tapping foot once is command to sit  finger pointing to the floor, or 3 foot taps means lay  If I whistle "Dixie" really loudly, stomp foot, and point, that's the emergency command to lay down quickly (emergency safety command for the lake)  Holding arm away from body and pointing to the door means "please leave".  She had these down before she was a year old, but for some strange reason it took a year and 3 months to get her to NOT go in the house.
k3AmV6waaa	Why are you asking this on yahoo answer when you should bring him to the vet?|`|RAtgv9GHaa	I would call the vet just incase for tomarrow.......|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Does he cry when he urinates? Has he been neutered? The reasons I ask these things is because if he cries when he urinates. He probably has a urinary tract infection, in which case, yes that would be an emergency. Cats (or animals period for that matter) don't want to be touched or handled if something hurts them.  But if he has yet to be neutered. He's probably just fussin for a mate. But the first thing that comes to mind is the infection. He may need to see his vet.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	Yes take your cat to the vet asap. There are things we don't know how to diagnose. The things you said could be signs of a tumor epilepsy or worse. When cats hide it is because hey are scared and in pain. I had a cat actually just drop dead. He was running and then just died. We found him a few minutes later. It was awful. He always complained slot. We always assumed it was because of trauma he received before we had him. Don't worry just get proactive. You can still have time to find out what is going on. Good luck let me know what happens.|`|87Zhgwmcaa	I strongly believe this is an emergency. Urinating on the floor means something is seriously wrong. I doubt anyone on here will be able to tell you what your cat's problem exactly is, as the details are not very....detailed. But, I can advice you to check the litter box, his stool and urine, how many times he's used it the last couple days. Is he eating or drinking? These signs should help you decided how fast you can act although, to be honest, if I were you I'd take him to an emergency vet. I would not wait one more day.     He is definitely in major distress. I'm quite sure he is in pain. Hiding under the bed is a clear sign that something is hurting. The best thing to do is have him checked by a vet as soon as possible.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	I'd see the vet asap. Could be any number of things to do with the kidneys and he's in pain.
CSWlD8Vjaa	Well we just got our dog microchipped a few weeks ago so here's how it works:    They insert this tiny chip (with a needle) into the dogs shoulders so that if a vet or a shleter ever get their hands on the dog then they can scan the shoulder to see if any number comes up. At the time of microchipping you register that number to your name so that they can contact you that they have your dog.    Now if somebody off the street picks your dog up then they can't get it back to you, but if they ever take it to the vet, the vet is required to scan the dog to see if they have a microchip and if they do, they'll give you a call and tell you that somebody else has your dog.    It's an okay system of getting your dog back, I mean it gives you an extra sense of security that maybe you'll get your dog back, but nothing beats putting up those signs and looking around, lol.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	Microchip implants (about the size of a grain of rice) can be detected by scanners distributed to veterinarians and shelters. Microchips contain a specific number, which, when registered, will trace back to your submitted information and will help you in getting your animal back! Microchips can be implanted in dogs, cats, ferrets, and birds. Many times, when someone finds a pet, the veterinarian will perform an exam and usually they will check for a microchip just in case. Also, since the scanners are distributed for free, almost every shelter in the country has one and they routinely scan their newly admitted dogs.  Microchips are a great way to ensure that if your pet somehow gets lost (think of Homeward Bound). Tags are great, however collars can be removed or lost, so they are the best way to be reunited with your animal!|`|nI8G21y8aa	the chip only works if the person that fids it is responsable enough to bring itto a vet. then the vet wil scan it using this really cool looking 'wand' and if the dog has a chip then the info will show up on the screen of the wand.|`|PFBKuVhBaa	if the dog is taken to the vet or the animal shelter  the people there usually check for the chip and thats how you get contacted  buuuuut if someone finds your lost dog and never takes them to either the chip is completely useless|`|3zv2bbolaa	The microchip is a glass encased implanted radio-frequency (RFID) microchip transponder that contains contact information that is read by a special scanner that vets and shelters purchase.  The chip is implanted by injection and then the information must be registered by the owner with the company that manufactures the chip. If this is not done, the chip is useless.     The vet or shelter scans the animal, collects the identification numbers and is able to contact the owners.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	You have to register the microchip so that when it is scanned, they can trace the chip back to you.  However, for that to work, the animal has to be scanned.  If it is picked up by HES, they are generally scanned.  Whenever an animal is found and brought to our clinic, we scan them as well.  If someone finds your dog (or takes it) and does not report it as found, the chances of that dog being scanned are minimal unless they decide they want it chipped.  Animals are supposed to be scanned prior to chipping them.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	microchip is one of the best things you can do to protect the animal you love. It is a small chip inserted under the skin, it does not leave a cut or a scar. It takes a few minutes for the procedure and your dog will not even cry. It is a microchip that has all your information stored on it, if your dog is lost, and taken to a vet who has never given this dog care before he will automatically be scanned and whoever had him micro chipped will be the one whose information came up and they will be contacted. all shelters and vets are scanning and trying to protect our loved ones.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	microchips have a registration number coded into them. If someone finds a lost pet then they can take it to a vet or shelter and have it scanned. The scan will show the number and the company. Then the number is run through that company's database then it matches to the owner's name and address. They are not a tracking device as I have seen so many people erroneously assume. So unless the dog gets scanned then no one even knows whether the animal has a chip or not. Vets, pounds, and shelters, are supposed to scan any animal that comes in as a stray or foundling.|`|k0kKaRZ7aa	The microchip is no bigger than a small needle and is inserted under the skin. It is not always affective as for the finders of the dog would have to take the dog to a vet in order for it to be returned to you. I have heard of a few people getting their dogs tattooed. Tattooing your dog consists of getting either of your dogs inner back thighs tattooed with your name, phone number/address, etc. This way if they are rubbing your dogs belly or something the finder of your dog can have your name and some other info. Another simpler way is giving your dog a I.D. tag. It can fall off though. If they catch the small loop on something it can rip it off as for the metal ring used to hold it on isn't very strong. Although the tag can be ripped off it is a better way for the finders of your dog to identify who he/she belongs to. Hope this helps!|`|11aoH0O5aa	Microchip only works if : Your dog gets lost and someone finds it and takes it to a vet , then the vet can read the chip . BUT if not then the chip is worthless !!
6KxBqnstaa	This can often be caused from dry heat in the house or something being used in the air. Like perfumes, candles, air fresheners, as birds are very sensitive. I would try keeping him warmer by placing a heating pad set on low under cage bottom(outside cage bottom) and covering with a blanket half way. I would get a warm mist humidifier or a vaporizer and keep in the same room as the bird. Lots of time the dander from their feathers can make them sneeze. You can wipe his nares with a warm washcloth also to help. Call a avian vet in area and see if they take payments as many do or apply for credit card. Signs of illness will be bobbing of the tail, gasping, noticeable heavy breathing, puffing up, sleeping more, going to bottom of cage. He could have URI or air sac mites as well. I would try these things but at same time would call vet and see if work something out. Good luck.

Ivermectin is used in many cases to treat mites, but you have to know the bird's exact weight to be able to determine the dosage.  If the dosage is wrong, you can make the bird even sicker or kill it.  I would give your local avian vet a call and see what would be the best dosage of invermectin to give the bird.  I'd personally be afraid to just medicate the bird on my own.  <br>  <br>  Here is some information that may be of help:<br>  <a href="http://www.abbaseed.com/Supplements/Suppl2/IVERMECTIN/ivermectin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abbaseed.com/Supplements/Supp...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aaawebmaster.com/canary/disease.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaawebmaster.com/canary/disea...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/airsacmites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/airsacmites.html</a>
o93EwErKaa	Now that Buddy has reached maturity he is wanting to have the Alpha Male title.  In some instances, the older male will allow this to happen or the younger male won't challenge the older dog.  Since this is not happening in your situation it is not going to change on its own.  You could try neutering both males to see if that helps (if not done already) or hiring a trainer.  It is doubtful that this problem will resolve on its own unless one of the dogs decide to submit to the other.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	They are both males, and one has to be boss. Are dogs used to just fight it out and the older one became boss. You kinda gotta let nature set in. Also if they're not neutered get them neutered because that can make them fight if both males not neutered. I think since the other one is younger they just need a long time to get used to each other.

That way you are showing them that YOU are the leader.  If you lead, they will both have to be followers.  (And a tired dog will be less likely to start trouble.)<br>  <br>  If they do fight, discipline the dog who started it.  That will also show them that you are the leader, not them.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	The very first thing to do is start giving them lots more exercise than they're getting!  Keep them both on a leash and take them for a walk.  Make them walk at heel in order to help bond them to you and to each other.  If one or both of them don't know how to walk at  heel, then walk each one separately until they both know, and then walk them together for at least an hour twice a day.  Also incorporate active play, obedience drills, and anything else you can think of that will help to tire them out so they don't have the energy to fight with each other.  After awhile, they'll stop their fighting, as long as they're getting enough exercise and as long as you stop them when they get started.  Don't wait for the fight to break out - stop them with the very first growl!<br>  <br>  If you can't watch them, keep them in crates instead of tethering them. Or keep the agitator (the one who starts the fights) on a leash tied to your waist so you can keep him from attacking the other.  But don't separate them because that will just make it worse.  <br>  <br>  Bonding, exercise and supervision, plus a ZERO tolerance for aggression of any kind,  is essential to getting your dogs to stop fighting with each other.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|2eJcaeOPaa	sounds like buddy has reached maturity and this is a dominance issue. rocky is trying to put buddy in his place (by growling) and buddy is challenging him perhaps speak to a behaviorist|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Are they fixed?They could be establishing pecking order,now that they are both mature.Good Luck.|`|iembGsl9aa	Bullmastiffs are very known for same sex aggression. <br>  <br>  Find a good behvaiourist and go.|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	In your situation, I'm going to be the bearer of bad news.  Your dogs are obviously trying to gain dominance over one another, but neither one is willing to submit to the other.  There are many cases where dogs will grow up together and then show this behavior.  Their breeds can certainly play a part in it, because both have a need to be the alpha male and they will do anything to get it.  Keep them separate, because this is just going to progressively get worse.  You need to find an animal behaviorist or trainer to work with, which your veterinarian can usually recommend to you.  If they continue to fight with each other, you will end up bringing them in to get sutured up, and you don't want it going that far.  There is hope for them, but you have to be a stickler.  If they are still intact, getting them neutered will help tremendously as well.

GdBG4PGYaa	Well, it took me four years, but I finally got the REAL (and only) reason my mom didn't want a cat. She was booked up financially, anything more she just didn't want to take a risk about. (We wouldn't go homeless or anything, though.)<br>  <br>  So, ignore all the "no space for litter box", "too many animals", " too much fur", "jump on counters", "live a long time", "too much money" etc. excuses. They don't mean anything.<br>  <br>  If she brings those up, then tell her a reason why you should get a cat (make this ahead of time) and a way her "reason" can be prevented or solved. I offered to pay for ALL of the cats expenses, my gerbils expenses, etc. She doesn't get it.<br>  <br>  <br>  No Space for Litter box:<br>  Find the perfect space for one. Measure the other one you have in your house. Then find a quiet space (that your cat can easily get too) and see if it will it there.<br>  <br>  Too Many Animals:<br>  Tell her what you told us. They don't have many years left, and 1 more animal (that you will pay for) won't make much of an impact on your parents wallet.<br>  <br>  Too Much Fur:<br>  I vacuum every day (it's not annoying, trust me), you could try that. Brush your cat every other day, or every day if it is long haired.<br>  <br>  Jumping on Counters:<br>  Spray bottles (don't let the cat see you aiming it. They will begin to run from you.)<br>  <br>  Just spray them, say a firm "No!", and take them down. Try and catch them jumping up, and spray, say "No!" and see if he still goes up. (Repeat until the cat gets it.)<br>  <br>  Live a Long Time:<br>  Yup! All the more reason to get one! You can love it throughout it's life (did you get bored of the other one? I don't think so!). You know they are a lot of responsibility, you've had them. You can handle it!<br>  <br>  Too Much Money:<br>  You can pay! (Hopefully, or reserve the cat, if that is possible, and start a pet sitting business). Offer to pay all the first costs, food for the rest of it's life, and litter. (Possibly the gas that it takes to get to the vets office. Not the whole expense!)<br>  <br>  Do some more research, then you will always have a preventative, for her reason.<br>  <br>  ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~<br>  <br>  Okay, so know that you know all of the things you can do or say for her "reasons" I'll give you some advice on how to convince her.<br>  <br>  1. Make a report on the good reasons to get a cat, the cons (and how they can be fixed), and how sweet and beautiful this cat is.<br>  <br>  2. Don't whine! Bring it up when your mom isn't busy, and have pictures of the kitten ready (www.Petfinder.com).<br>  <br>  3. Pay for everything yourself! Everything.<br>  <br>  4. Do extra chores around the house, be really kind to everybody living there, etc.<br>  <br>  5. Take good care of the animals you already have, prove you can love any animal, and this animal will be loved even more.<br>  <br>  6. Don't be upset if the overall answer is no, you still have other animals and if they die, maybe you can get a kitten!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|TFTXxGozaa	tell her you have mice in your house....|`|Amkmles0aa	say you have big rats in your home
4TX26viFaa	Think about it--if you think worms come from milk - and you are giving store bought milk - why don't WE have worms?<br>  <br>  The FDA would shut down any site that sells contaminated food. Milk does not come out of the cow with parasites swimming in it.  It's cooled, then homoginized before being bottled, and it's tested at the facility that does the bottling.  If there's antibiotics in the milk from the cow being treated for something, the milk is discarded. <br>  <br>  Worms live in the intestines of animals.  No milk comes from the intestines.<br>  <br>  Cats get worms from eating prey that has parasites in their intestines.  Or from ingesting fleas that may have the larvae stage of tapeworm in them (they're part of the tapeworm life cycle).  They don't get it from milk.|`|w1lh1INHaa	No, milk will not give a cat worms.  A little sloppy poop maybe, but not worms.<br>  <br>  Most cats become lactose intolerant after weaning, so a little milk every day is not a good idea, just a lap or two every now and then, but not daily.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I simply don't understand why people say cats can get worms from our pasteurized milk.  It's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  If your cat likes that morning treat and it doesn't cause any bowel problems, it's just fine and as long as the cat's other food is formulated right for cats.<br>  <br>  Humans are the only species to take to other mammals milk as a food source all their lives.  For cats and other mammals the milk an animal gets from its mother is all they need for a lifetime.
MsfklXLzaa	Take him to the same spot everyday and once he does his business in a certain spot, he marked his territory and will go back to where he went the first time. How? Well, he can smell his own scent. But keep training him and encouraging him. Be patient. In time, he'll be your little poo in a certain spot pup!! :))|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Actually it's NOT hard to do.  I did it.  <br>  <br>  What you need is a big play pen...surround a corner of your yard with the play pen.  I even go further, I put stones as cover and a piece of artificial turf on top.  Then what you do is you need to commit a few weeks time that you will actually walk your dog to that area....take an easy time as a  start, ie first thing upon waking up.  Puppy needs to pee and poo upon waking up, pick him up take him there...use a leash to guide him to walk circle...it will pee.  The poo part is something that will come naturally, I find.  First my dog will only pee there, I need to walk him outside of the yard to do his number two.  Then one day, he woke up and got lazy...and did both his numbers in that area.  After few mths of doing this, you just gradually take down the playpen.|`|A21SswSfaa	That's difficult to do, and not necessary. Dogs aren't like people. Your dog does that because he's marking territory. It's what dogs do and you can't stop that. I clean up my backyard weekly or more.

l0ktQUnWaa	It sounds like you do need a filter! And, it also sounds like you need a vet. I don't understand why you would get a $40.00 turtle and not want to take him to a vet. You need to be a responsible pet owner, it doesn't matter what the animal costs! If this animal survives, you need to realize that this turtle needs more than a 10 gallon tank. He will need heat and lighting too! So many people only think of the cost of the animal.|`|8e29d822ee2591d8c0d0032e70287c8baa	get a filter you need one .And from what you are saying you need it bad|`|EDOxXdcoaa	At 14 years old you really had no business bringing home an animal without your parents' consent, especially if you aren't capable of providing adequate care (read: capable of affording medical treatment when necessary and affording proper caging and equipment). That out of the way....<br>  <br>  Turtles are very messy, especially when confined to a small tank. Babies grow fairly quickly and will shed their skin frequently so a filter is definitely necessary unless you are doing water changes on a daily basis. The rule of thumb with turtles is to provide 10 gallons for each inch of turtle. If this is a neonate the 10 gallon tank may work for now but you will soon need to upgrade. A single adult turtle needs at least a 75 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  Does this turtle have access to dry land or a landing pad in the tank? Does it have a basking lamp? How warm are you keeping the enclosure? Does it have a high spectrum UVB light? These are all essentials in keeping a turtle healthy and happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit to add*<br>  You don't mention having a UVB light for him. Without exposure to full spectrum UVB light turtles, especially young turtles, can quickly succumb to metabolic bone disease (MBD) and this is an ailment much easier (and affordable) to prevent than to treat. <br>  <br>  A 10 gallon tank may  be ideal for hatchlings, but only temporarily. Do not expect it to be comfortable in that tank for much longer. You don't mention what variety of turtle you have, but I'll assume that we're talking about a red eared slider as these are very popular in the pet trade. Here is a photo comparing an adult and a baby:<br>  <a href="http://www.gregrothschild.com/newspring08w/vh33_thm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gregrothschild.com/newspring0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I would take the advice of pet store staff with a hefty grain of salt as they tend to have only a very basic understanding of most of the animals they sell. They are looking to make a profit for their store not to educate buyers (as this can often dissuade them from making a purchase once they realize how much money they will have to invest in the animal). <br>  <br>  I would say the same of most vets. Really GOOD herp vets that are well-versed in specific reptile care are few and far between. If your said you didn't need a filter, I'd be willing to bet s/he is not in that category. I would advise picking up a Reptiles magazine (or similar publication) and pick a reputable vet in listed in the back of the mag. There are usually at least a few listed for each state. <br>  <br>   As for your tank issues. Consider upgrading to a larger tank now and getting a good submersible filter. Smaller tanks hold more concentrated amounts of water which means there is less room for waste to dissipate. That makes for an unhealthy environment. Small aquariums have to be cleaned more frequently than larger aquariums for this reason. As for filters, you want a submersible one because a turtle's tank isn't going to be full and traditional power filters aren't designed to be used in a half-filled aquarium. I recommend using a Hagen Fluval Plus submersible.
xHxKDQ80aa	I asked my vet this when my female cat got a UTI as we were moving and the vet's reply was that just like us humans when they stress their immune systems are more fragile thus making it easier for bacteria to attack a weak spot. In some cats their weakest spot is the urinary tract or the bladder and an infection pops up there. <br>  <br>  If you think about it, when we are stressing out over exams, personal life or a significant other, we may get a cold or sinus infection as a result...<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little...|`|TFTXxGozaa	definitely...... yup|`|AA11736483	Yes, stress weakens the body and can trigger many different problems.|`|2zG7XZMEaa	It's so funny you should ask that today. I took my kitty to the vet today because he couldn't pee. She asked if he'd been under any kind of stress, which he hasn't. He got shots and medicine and still won't pee. Good luck with yours.
MjoIio7faa	I was a Vet Technician for 12 years, usually when a cat goes outside of the litter box, that is his way of telling you he is sick. He probably has a urinary trac infection. Take him to Vet and see.

EZkKZtGxaa	A Tank for Axolotls <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Axolotls can get quite large, so I would recommend at least a 56-75 litre tank.  Most owners will find a filtered aquarium easier to maintain; without a filter their water will need frequent changing. However, the filtration rate should be fairly slow and avoid powerful filters that create strong currents. A siphon can be used to vacuum the bottom of the tank, and a 20 percent water change should be done weekly. If you are not using a filter, you will have to do a 20% water change every day or every other day. Never do a full water change as this creates a situation where the water chemistry changes too drastically. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tap water should have any chlorine or chloramines (added during the water treatment process) removed using commercially available solutions. Never use distilled water. The pH of the water should be 6.5-7.5. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gravel <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If gravel is used on the bottom of the tank it needs to be coarse gravel. Fine gravel might be ingested during feeding. Some keepers simply leave the bottom of the tank bare, or use large river stones. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A bare tank makes it difficult for the axolotls, as they can't get a foothold on the bottom that way. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Temperature and Lighting <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The tank should be kept in a cool room away from bright sunlight. The water temperature should be kept cool, between 14-20 C, and never above 24 C. No special lighting is required, as axolotls appreciate a dark cave-like home. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Feeding Axolotls <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the wild, axolotls feed on snails, worms, crustaceans, small fish, and small amphibians. In captivity, they can be fed brine shrimp; small strips of beef or liver, bloodworms, tubifex worms, or commercial fish pellets (e.g. salmon or trout pellets). If feeding these fresh items it is best to feed a variety to get a better balance in the diet. You can also get special axolotl feeding blocks from your local pet store. I pay $8.00 for 35 meals of axolotl tucker.  You should feed an axolotl approximately every three days.  Uneaten food should be cleaned from the tank daily
zqVDJxUIaa	The disease (white spots) is Fish Ich/Ick. Ich (ick) is the most common disease of all freshwater and marine aquarium fish. Anyone that keeps fish for any period of time will eventually have fish that develop ich. Many hobbyists consider this disease to be just a common nuisance but the reality is that ich is probably responsible for more fish deaths than just about any other disease. <br>  <br>  The symptoms of ich are very evident and usually include characteristic white spots on the body and gills. In some infections, the ich organisms will only be found on the gills. As the disease progresses, the fish will become more irritated and may try to rub or scratch against the sides and bottom of the tank. The disease may then cause respiratory distress, severe agitation, loss of appetite, and eventually death.<br>  <br>  This disease is often identified based upon history, symptoms, and the presence of white spots, but if there is any question, it can be identified microscopically. A lesion can be scraped and viewed under the microscope to reveal a rather large cyst between .5 and 1.5 mm in diameter. The life cycle of Ichthyophthirius is complicated but very important in understanding the treatment and prevention of ich. Once the ich protozoan attaches to the side of the fish, it begins feeding on the skin and tissue causing irritation. The fish's body begins to wall off the parasite to try to limit its damage. The protozoan continues to move around in the cyst feeding and growing, while the body continues to further encapsulate and wall it off. This encapsulation by the body is one of the reasons that ich is so difficult to treat during this stage of the disease because medications cannot penetrate through the wall of the cyst to reach the ich parasite. During this stage, the ich protozoan is called a trophozoite. The trophozoite eventually matures and is termed a "trophont." It will burst through the cyst wall and then fall to the bottom of the aquarium. It then begins to divide into hundreds of new ich-infecting units called tomites. This stage is very temperature-dependent within its capsule, with the fastest replications occurring at warmer temperatures near 78-80°F. At optimum temperatures, the replication will be completed in about 8 hours. At lower temperatures, the replication takes longer making the treatment time for eradication much longer.<br>  <br>  Once the replication is complete, the trophont bursts and releases the newly-formed tomites into the water. The tomites are motile and swim around the tank searching for a fish to attach to. Once they attach to a fish, the cycle will start over again. It is during this stage that ich is most susceptible to treatment. Many of the available medications will kill the tomites, thereby stopping the cycle of ich in your tank. It should be noted that these tomites will only survive for 48 hours, if they do not find a fish to attach to. These tomites will also attach to plants, filter material, etc. So if you move a plant from an infected tank into a clean tank, you have just infected the clean tank with ich. Depending on the water temperature, the whole cycle can take from 4 days to several weeks.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing for the cottony growths, but for Ich, you must do the following:    <br>     <br>  <br>   * Raise water temperature (slowly, up to 80 F, as the ich   protozoan dies at 80F<br>      * Medicate for 10-14 days<br>      * Reduce medication when treating scaleless fish<br>      * Discontinue carbon filtration during treatment<br>      * Perform water changes between treatments<br>  <br>  The entire cycle takes about two weeks from start to finish. Higher temps will shorten the cycle, while low temps lengthen it. Therefore, raising the water temp shortens the time it takes for the parasite to reach the stage in which it is susceptible to medication.Treatments must be given for a long enough period to assure that all parasites are gone. Watch carefully for other infections, as secondary infections often occur where the skin has been damaged by the parasite.<br>  <br>  Although nothing kills the parasite once it has checked into it's fish "hotel", several chemicals kill ich once it has left the fish. Malachite green, methylene blue, quinine hydrochloride, and mepracrine hydrochloride are all effective, and are available under several brand names.<br>  <br>  Dose based on the package instructions, however cut dosages in half when treating scaleless catfish and tetras. Regardless of the medication used, treatment should be given continuously for 10-14 days to ensure all parasites are killed. Between treatments a partial water change is recommended. Keep water temperatures higher than usual to speed up the life cycle of the parasite. Discontinue carbon filtration during treatment, as it will remove the chemicals.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  More info on ich:<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Treat-Tropical-Fish-With-White-Spot-Disease-(ich)" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Treat-Tropical-Fi...</a><br>  -----------------------------------<br>  The plecos did not die from the medication, they were most likely already dying.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The tank is overstocked. Stress from ammonia poisoning may have brought on ich and fungal infections.<br>  <br>  1. What is your maintenance schedule for the tank? With an overstocked oscar tank I would do at least two weekly water changes of about 25%<br>  2. I think the plecos were already on their way out when you added the tank buddies. I don't think they contributed to their death. <br>  3. I doubt that had anything to do with it. Odds are they didn't even have the energy to do so.<br>  4. I would concentrate on finding a larger tank for the oscars before adding more fish into this tank.<br>  <br>  ~The 75 would be an improvement, but still on the small side for two oscars. Switching everyone else over to the 55 would work, but I would add more fish. Corydoras should be in larger groups though.|`|q0vKbocHaa	this sounds like a outbreak if ich. <br>  <br>  1. Yes, but I think you can find some ich stuff at the petstore as well<br>  2. Now the pleco's probably died on their own<br>  3. If you just added the pleco's, they could've carried ich and then passed it along to your ocsars.<br>  4. The pleco's should've been ok with them. Unfortunatly, one (or both) of them were sick and passed it along.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	2 oscars and 2 plecos, you should've had them in a tank over 100 gallons, just to give you an idea of how overstocked it was.  One oscar alone needs at least a 55 gallon tank.  Two, you can get away with a 75 gallon.  <br>  <br>  From them laying on the bottom, and the tank being overstocked, sounds like poor water quality is what started all your problems in the tank.  How often were you changing out the water?  Normal stocked tanks should have 25% weekly water changes done.  With messier fish like oscars, I would go with 50% weekly as a minimum.  With your tank, more then that would've been needed. <br>  Also, what kind of filtration do you have?  You definitely want to overfilter a tank with oscars in it.  Two filters should be used, preferably a hob/hang on the back power filter and a canister filter.<br>  <br>  White crystal spots, sounds like ich.  It's a parasite, fairly common, usually brought on by stress(from poor water quality is the main reason most of the time).  The fungus is most likely not a true fungal infection, but a bacterial infection called columnaris.  That will commonly show up in tanks with poor water conditions as well.  <br>  <br>  At this point, I would do a partial water change, about 40%.  Pick up some Maracyn Two or tetracycline.  The Maracyn Two is a bit more expensive, but supposedly it doesn't kill off your beneficial bacteria like tetracycline will, so try to go with that one if you can.  That'll help with the columnaris infection.<br>  <br>  For the ich, add 1 tablespoon of salt per 5 US gallons, dissolved first in a bucket with some dechlorinated water.  Add it slowly over the course of an hour.  Also, slowly increase your tank temperature to about 80°F.  Usually when treating for ich, you want it higher, but since you're possibly dealing with a bacterial infection as well-which thrive in warmer temps, I don't recommend going any higher then 80°F.  And, it's safe to use the salt, heat, and Maracyn Two together.  I would stop using the Fungus Clear, since that's not what you're dealing with.  Be sure all carbon is removed as well from your filter.<br>  <br>  For your questions...<br>  1.  See above.<br>  <br>  2.  Yes, it's possible the Fungus Clear killed the plecos.  Since they both died about the same time, I would say it's more then likely that's what killed them off.  Plecos are considered a scaleless fish, and are very sensitive to a lot of medications.  <br>  <br>  3.  Plecos can suck the slime coat off of any fish, not just goldfish.  Did you see this happening?  Usually this only occurs when the pleco has no other food in the tank.  They'll clear a tank of algae very quickly, so supplemental feedings is a must.  And, 1 pleco is generally more then enough for a tank, unless you're tank is over the 100 gallon range.  As I said above, your issues stemmed from poor water quality, not the pleco sucking on the oscars. <br>   <br>  4.  I would suggest no other fish in your current tank set up.  Give some thought to a 75 gallon in your near future as well if you intend to keep both those oscars.  They do most of their growing the first year, and should be about 9-10 inches by the end of the first year.  Plecos are fine with them, but again, not in your tank, and probably not a good idea in a 75 gallon with them either.  Really, no other algae eater will work with them, most others are too small and will most likely be eaten by the oscar.  <br>  <br>  And, not sure on your water changing schedule, but for now in your 50 gallon with the two oscars, I would suggest getting into a 50% weekly change.  Either do one 50% change a week, or which is better all around do two 25% weekly water changes.  Once you upgrade to a 75 gallon, I think you should be fine going on a weekly schedule of about 30%, assuming you have good filtration as well.<br>  <br>  Here's some links with more info on columnaris and ich:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flippersandfins.net/Flexibacter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flippersandfins.net/Flexibact...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophthirius" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophth...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=16+1791&aid=2421" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  And some other good sites with good info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oscarfish.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oscarfish.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|AA11901352	I am sorry to hear about your fish.  First they don't have a fungus so don't bother with the fungus cure.<br>  <br>  If your fish have white spots that look like salt sprinkled all over them they have ich not fungus problems and you need to treat with ich meds or an anti parasitic medicine.  Ich is a parasite not a fungus.<br>  <br>  If your fish don't have white specks on them and it is just around their mouths or gills, they could have columnaris it is a bacterial infection and needs anti bacterial medicines.  Although it is called mouth fungus it is actually a bacterial infection.  You will have to decide.  Ich will look more like salt and will kill a fish faster than the columnaris will.<br>  <br>  Follow the directions and yes the carbon needs removed in either case.<br>  <br>  I don't think the tank buddies fungus clear killed your other fish.  Although plecos are fairly hearty I don't think that is what killed them.<br>  <br>  No the plecos did not make the oscars open for infection by sucking on them.  If your plecos are sucking on your other fish they are looking for algae you need to feed them more and varied foods like zucchini or cuke slices.<br>  <br>  You also should remain on a weekly 25% water change with gravel vacing.<br>  <br>  Ich is a parasite that is in the water.  It will only attach itself to stressed or immune deficient fish.  Keep the stress down, water quality high and chances are you won't see ich too often.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|tDP6ru3oaa	White crystal-like spots! That doesn't sound good! It sounds like a disease my brother had in his tank. His pleco died from it. It's caused by dirty water or sometimes the filter. So if it was the dirty water you did the right thing by doing a 20% water change. If it was the filter then you might wont to get a new one.<br>  Here are the answers to your questions.<br>  1. Yes you did the right thing by treating the fish.<br>  2. No I'm pretty sure the pleco's died on their own. They were probebly too sick and you didn't get to them on time.<br>  3. I'm pretty sure that only happens with goldfish and Pleco's because Pleco's are community fish.
ZX9vDS9iaa	No, It is one of the worst. It has dies and chemicles that can harm your dog. Its main ingredients are "biproducts" of some kind of meat.. (beaks, feet, guts, eyeballs) Its main filler is corn, which does nothing for a dog. These are not opinions by the way, look in the ingredients. I did feed it to a dog when I was younger and didnt know better, and it didnt kill him or anything, but I switched his food at about 8 years old, and in no time he had more energy, and was healthier than he was at 4 years old!|`|MxNFH4iraa	yes|`|debd9c746580dbc944784f9038b27ce7aa	I actually fed Pedigree to my Dalmatian for almost 15 years and she was perfectly healthy in every way. After actually reading the ingredients label and researching dog foods, I realised I was feeding my beloved dog rubbish food. So no, it's not good dog food. It has a lot of fillers (corn mainly), by-products and fat in it. Look at your local pet shop for good quality dog food like Innova, Solid Gold or California Natural.|`|AA10584660	I like it.|`|YOxWUBkjaa	No it has alot of fillers so you dog will have to eat more and that will make your dog have to poop more which means you will have to clean up more.      Try something with real meat as the number 1 ingredient such as Purina one.|`|RcTw7UXiaa	definately not!|`|rM6F9whsaa	Someone fed their dog pedigree and it lived healthy for 15 years? (which is the average healthy dog lifespan)  Then they go on to say it is junk?      Dont listen to people who drive Mercedes or BMW and call your Honda junk.  Its the same arguement.  By the standards given above, you shouldnt use advantage to control fleas because it poisons your dog... even though the amount of toxicity wouldn't hurt your canine till it was in its 30 years of age(human aging).  By the way, no dog lives to 30,... and is healthy if it could.  The point I am making is I've also raised 3 adult dogs on pedigree, to age of 15 or older and all were healthy till they died of age related complications.  Sure you can pay 3X the amount for food that is holistic, but can most people afford the food let alone the $3.40 /gallon gas to fill that BMW or Mercedes?    Both dogs will live to age 15 and both dogs will be healthy.  But your dog will either be a Honda or a BMW.   Can money stop your dog from eventually getting old?  NO.|`|JMksg9vdaa	no its cheap and nasty with a hell of a lot of fillers. every person i get off this food and others like it and on to the premium foods notice huge differences from personality, energy levels to less poo that smells less. that says a lot
AA10036420	That would take a long time.  Lobsters usually take about 5-7 years to grow a pound.  It would take a long time.  Rememeber bubba?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_the_l...|`|AA11901352	A lobster grows by shedding its shell.  A lobster will shed 25 times in the first 5-7 years of life. Following this cycle, the lobster will weigh approximately one pound and reach minimum legal size.  After that for each molt the lobster will increase in weight 40% So to get a 12 pound lobster it would take 8 more moltings or about 4 years (most will shed twice per year however with lots of food, it could take less)    the oldest lobster on record was over 100 years old and weighed 43 pounds.|`|542012bab64a426db53af066b9dd765eaa	a few years...    depends on conditions where it is living|`|d490f391f86620105b6e618d90c1bcf8aa	My guess is that a lobster would never grow to be 12 lbs.  Most of the lobsters I've had have been 1 lb, and not much more.  I have heard of 2 lbs, but to have a lobster be six times that size?  That does not seem very likely.
