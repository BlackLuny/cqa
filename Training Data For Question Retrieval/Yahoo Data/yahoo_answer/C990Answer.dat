'how can i pi$$ off the most leathal bowling combination in cricket? i know! i'll put them in pink!' Joel Garner was dangerous enough when he was in a good mood!<br>  <br>  personally, i'm old fashioned, i think Test should be day games, but the world moves on and cricket has to move with it, i have no problem with the pink ball PROVIDED that its easy to see, that the ball will still get swing for the bowlers and that it lasts the required 80 overs, aside from that i have no real conerns about it and better still, the sale of these pink balls could be used to help raise money for Breast Cancer, so provided these balls work properly, i have no problem with them|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Yep, must agree with Marco & company.

Whats wrong with day test matches as they are?? <br>  Hope all this new technology in the game only does it good!|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Well, call me old fashioned but I think tests should be played during the day.  But if they go for night tests, then a pink ball should be fine.  It might even promote Breast Cancer|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	A night time test!! sounds a bit weird doesn't it.<br>  <br>  but everything under the spell of  Evolution<br>  <br>  so why not test cricket~|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	I agree with Marco on this one.

V0ruWwNpaa	The bait you are using will catch small fish, also catfish if properly placed, also trout if properly rigged and placed. Bass will also eat worms (if properly rigged and placed). Do you see the answer here <br>  1. look at how you are rigging, and placement of your rig. if you are fishing close to shore your most likely going to catch smaller fish which hide there from bigger fish. Try and find a drop off, or a point and fish those areas. Also live minnows work very well on bass and bigger fish. If you have lures like crank baits and spinners use these, but get ready to cast a lot! It's fun and breaks up the boredom of just sitting around waiting on a fish to find your bait<br>  You can catch bass at the bank during the spawn, but you need to use a bait that makes them mad and protective of the nest<br>  good luck|`|XKdUGiwFaa	Fish eat other fish.  Try getting some live suckers or shiners like four or five inches long for bait.  Put them on a hook with a little weight to hold them down and a float to hold them up, see if you don't get a big one, probably Bass or Pike.  <br>  <br>  Try getting someone experienced to take you fishing.  That will help more than the computer will.<br>  <br>  Go to your local library and ask if they have any books or videos about fishing.  They probably will and best of all they are free.  These can be good sources to learn about fishing but the real trick is to keep trying .  Good Luck.|`|amlmhoUuaa	You can't go wrong with plastic worms or lizards|`|DYFDlCUiaa	Read up a lot and buy the things that you need. Their are countless articles in magazines and on the internet with millions of tips and techniques to get you on your way. 99% of catching fish is knowing their patterns and tendencies relative to time, weather conditions, and seasons of the year, etc. If you can locate the fish and you know what the main forage of your quarry is, you increase your chances of hooking quality fish exponentially. Also, you just have to go out there and do it. There is no real wax-on, wax-off to it. You learn by doing it. As you go out more often, you will learn by simply observing and also, if you see other anglers, try and strike up conversations. I have learned a lot over the years by listening to the advice of fellow anglers, and my grandfather..who was easily the best trout fisherman I've ever met. Keep asking questions and be like a sponge, ready to soak up information and put it to use. I'm going to assume that you are a novice, (correct me by all means if I'm wrong) so I would get myself a good spinning rod and reel combo. A spinning setup will allow you farther casts and allow you to cover more water. Baitcasters are good too, but I would wait for a good while until you get more experience with a spinning setup before you graduate up to a baitcaster. Good luck and tight lines!|`|KJWxqQHiaa	1.) How do i catch big fish?<br>  <br>  With worms, hot dogs, bread or cheese, you're going to catch more small ones, than others. But, if you set them on the bottom, with a sinker you will have a chance at a decent sized bullhead or channel cat. Don't use a bobber, just a couple split-shots.<br>  <br>  2.) Do i buy equipment that helps find fish?<br>  <br>  If you fish on a boat, there are radars but, i don't have a boat, and don't have a fish-finder. I don't think you need a fish-finder to catch quality fish but, it sure does help!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	NO, NO, NO,! BIG FISH= BIG BAIT!!!!!|`|6rRVLHonaa	I live in the UK and the best time i've had in catching big fish and big bass of 10 pounders or more is off the admiral[maritime] pier which goes right out and is 50 fathoms at it's highest tide.<br>  <br>  I fish the tide up when the current is very strong and I use a size 5 stainless steel hook and the bait is half a side of a makerel.  For live bait I have used large ragworm bunched on the hook. Soft crabs or peelers can be used also.<br>  <br>  To catch big fighting fish strong tackle must be used such as a 10 ft fibreglass rod and a strong boat reel if you're fishing off a pier.  Bass prefer to go for moving baits so you need to cast out and the weight lead sink a little then wind in pause and wind some until a contact is made.|`|YMoOsKGCaa	no catch a tiny fish cut off the head and tail use it as bait. pop the bait around too and reel it in slowly then pause then reel again. i live in a woody area and i live near a lake and fish. this a sure fire way to catch those big suckers. maybe walk into the lake a little to get some more distance because big fish tend to swim in the middle of the lake|`|IVxuz1Anaa	Fish plastic worms slow and easy this time of year . or you could fish with live bait , ugh .Find a point on the lake or good cover . good fishing .

IWM1khX7aa	He's already going to FC Koln in this summer and I think every Premier League team has enough strikers (at least the big 4 Arsenal Chelsea Liverpool and Man U).   <br>  <br>  Arsenal: Only if Van Persie or Adebayor leaves Emirates.<br>  <br>  Chelsea:  He would have Michael Ballack, but they already have Drogba and Anelka as strikers and Quaresma as a winger (Malouda or Deco on the left side.  If Guus Hiddink stays, he'll probably pick Pavyluchenko and some Russian players or some Dutch players (like Van Persie or maybe Robben could return).<br>  <br>  Liverpool:  They already got Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt, not to mention Ryan Babel on the left.  I think they want to go for Theo Walcott this summer anyways.<br>  <br>  Manchester United:  Team's full of talent and they already have three decent strikers (Bebatov, Tevez, Rooney) and he's not even as good as them.  They also have 3 left wingers (Giggs, Nani, Tosic).<br>  <br>  Even if he doesn't go to these teams, everyone else has better strikers than him anyways.  Aston Villa has Agbonlahor and Carew, Everton have Jo, Saha, Yakubu and Cahill.  Man City has Robinho, Bellamy, Benjani.  Tottenham has Keane, Defoe, Pavluychenko, Bent, Dos Santos, and Campbell.  Newcastle has Owen, Martins, Xisco and Viduka.<br>  <br>  The best team for him is West Ham United.  They're underrated and they need a new striker since Bellamy left (but what's wrong with Ashton and Cole?).  Gianfranco Zola would be lucky to have him at Upton Park, but Podolski does under perform sometimes.|`|p8lB73rdaa	I don't think that there are too many teams that wouldn't be interested in him , he's a very good player .<br>  However at the moment Manchester utd have a lot of strikers so I would imagine , Liverpool , Arsenal or Chelsea would be interested .|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Man Utd, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, he's a great player|`|DEcunDd5aa	I think that many premier league teams would want him on their team. He's a really good player and he's underrated. I would love for him to come to Chelsea but if Arsenal bought him I would have been really happy too :)|`|632BbbUtaa	probably every team|`|tbgaqgQyaa	i hate to say it but everton.. they need a striker for all the injuries they have tbh|`|zprMdpxZaa	i think arsenal would take him, they need a player like him|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Personally, I don't think he's good enough for a team like Manchester United or Chelsea, but I think the best team in the EPL that would take Podolski would be Liverpool. Since Robbie Keane left, I think he would make a good starting striker or left winger or a substitute for a left midfielder. It would be great to see him playing in the Big Four.<br>  However, if you're asking what team he'd be on if he started his season in the Premiership, since Liverpool didn't lose Keane yet, then I'd have to say a team like Tottenham Hotspur, and would probably be their lead striker. They're a good team, and they'd probably do better with him, probably in the top 10.<br>  In my opinion, his best case scenario: Liverpool or Arsenal, and his worst case scenario: Tottenham Hotspur or Newcastle.|`|AA10478052	Lukas does not fit manchester utd. due to too many strikers, and not chelsea because he doesnt fit our playing style, i think theres a chance of arsenal if they scraped money together, not liverpool I mean he simply cannot adopt benitez style...few can......Most Likely candidate....Man.

I am a spurs fan and i would love him to come to us.|`|rZ7ft6YAaa	all teams would take him bar united i would say, depending on his price<br>  <br>  everton or Portsmouth would be a good move.

A wrestler actually wrestles about three to four times a week depending on their popularity. If they are on TV, they will be in a house show. House shows are basically untelevised events that try to see which feuds hae potential.<br>  <br>  You don't usually get a break unless you're injured. Michelle McCool mentioned in an interview she had three days off for the first time in a year. Typically, when a wrestler isn't wrestling, they're traveling to wrestle somewhere.<br>  <br>  It's a hard life, but definately worth it.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Here is a typical day on the road for a WWE Pro Wrestler and a Diva: You wake up at 7:00 in the morning. You get to the airport at 8:30. You take a flight across the country and arrive at 11:00. After renting a car, checking into a hotel room, and something to eat, it’s 1:00. Time to go to a photo shoot. So you drive to a mall and sign autographs until 3:00. It’s time to head on over to the arena. Getting through traffic, you might make it by 4:30. After you eat something and do a short workout, it’s 5:30. At that time you go talk to one of the bookers and he goes over your match with you. If you can find the time, you and your opponent do a quick run down of what’s going to happen. By then it’s 7:00 and it’s time to go on. You wrestle a match and leave the arena at 10:00. You get to the hotel by 12:00 and get some sleep before you do it all over again in the morning. Now find time to workout and keep the marvelous body a wrestler has. And you want some sort of social life don’t you? Good luck.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	y2j is right. it's way too confusing for me and it takes a lot too get through even one day.i would only go for it if you are a real dedicated person who's lifelong dream is to become a diva. not an overnight decision|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	I like to watch wrestling.

Trying to smuggle your gun out and disobey them is probably just going to get you in trouble and may get your gun taken away until your parents' feel your mature enough to use it responsibly.|`|oSakZ1asaa	This kind of dishonest behavior suggests you aren't mature enough to handle the responsibility of gun ownership.

If my little brother decided to start shooting stuff for the fun of it I'd punch him in the head.<br>  <br>  Edit-Who said you were spoiled or rich? I merely suggest you grow up and quit being a child.

dFHsAXDMaa	Hi sweety I coach cheering and went to college on a cheering and softball scholarship. join you will have a blast all star teams are great and with in a few weeks you will be a tumbling pro. we take our high school squad every year to an allstar gym to have them teach tumbling and within two weeks girls who could not do a cartwheel are doing back handspring. Just be warned my daughter cheers all star and it is a very big commitment and it can be very expensive. <br>  <br>  Talk to you parents with the economy the way it is do not be disappointed if they do not think they can spend the money right now. Although many gyms like the one my daughter goes look for sponsors for the girls. If anything try  out for high school football next year and take a tumbling class over the summer good luck|`|Gek1nZ1paa	if its all-star im pretty sure you will need to know how to tumble so work on that! practice everything you used to do back when  you were a cheerleader<br>  <br>  answer mine please!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArsqJmHrWhso9pdKu4JMZOfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219172131AA7WUbp">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Q9KgX9bfaa	hey:) im fourteen too, and i did all star cheer for three years straight. still goin(: well, from my advice (im on a junior level five team), <br>  if you are really wanting to make a higher team, then you should really focus on stretching.  there are lots of limber movements, and as for the tumbling, i would recomend having a layout or a full if you are wanting on a level five team.<br>  <br>  level five:<br>  tumbling- toetouch tuck, handspring tuck, full, layout, standing tuck.<br>  flying- heal stretch, scorion, scale, (be able to twist down from all- double down would be best.)<br>  basing- dont be afraid of the person above you, lol i know its scary, but your coach will put you in more stunts and the flyer will do better with a trustworthy base.<br>  <br>  level four:<br>  tumbling- layout, standing tuck, handspring tuck,<br>  flyer- scorpion, heal stretch, liberty, arbesque, and twist down, (double down would be awesme:D )<br>  base- same as level five,<br>  <br>  level three:<br>  tumbling- tuck, standing two backhandsprings, front walk over.<br>  flyer- liberty, arbesque, twist down from two legs.<br>  base- hold a one leg, and a two leg<br>  <br>  level two:<br>  tumbling- backhandspring, backhandspring series would be good,<br>  stunting- lots of halfs, <br>  <br>  <br>  and most of all, remember to smile:D

bpm8N49Oaa	It's not easy to pull a muscle, you have to be a pretty dynamic athlete to pull a muscle.  Unless you are an older stronger athlete, you probably just strained it and need to ice up and stay off for a while|`|Nh7f8Rojaa	ok there are a couple dif things that could have happened<br>  <br>  the first one (i did this racing my gfs sister to the car, i beat her by alot) what happens is you feel a lil pop in your hip, and then a pain that feels like you pulled a muscle, one of the tendons that connects the quadricep to the hip rolls out of place and is strained a bit as it glides over the bone or cartilege, when i did it, for the next 3 weeks i could feel it alot later in the day, like after 9pm, but id still be able to run enough (it happened in the fall, so it didnt affect any 100m races i could have been in lol) i stretched it alot, the best way i found was by kneeling only on my left knee (it was my left hip that hurt) and then i raised my left arm up, while really tryin to stretch that part of my hip out<br>  <br>  another scenario is that yes you pulled your quad, in which case, stretch alot before working out or racing, and take things easier, or do less short distance (nothing 200 or lower) try to ease back into things, last time i pulled my quad, i stretched alot (but only for 3 sets of 7 seconds) before and after working out, and it got better in a lil more than a week<br>  <br>  the third scenario is that you just strained it, which is likely cuz of how fast the 100m is, stretching is also key in trying to cure this, and again, 3 sets of 7 seconds of the heel to butt stretch should do it plus the kneeling one<br>  <br>  stretching is your best option, good luck!
svEdo4FBaa	The leash that you're describing used to be required to wear back when resorts didn't trust snowboarders.  Since skis have a braking device on them, skiers didn't have to have a leash attaching the ski to their leg, even though skis come off all the time.  Resorts figured, well, what if a snowboard comes off????  It could kill someone!<br>  <br>  This was retarded thinking, because while skis are designed to come off in a fall, it's pretty rare that a snowboard binding's strap breaks, and even when it does - yeah, your other leg is still attached to the board.  The chances of both bindings coming loose from your feet at the same time are infinitesimal. <br>  <br>  So, long story short - you can throw the leash away.  It serves no purpose and I don't know of any mountains that require you to wear it, and I haven't seen any lift operators check for it in over a decade.<br>  <br>  Hey Steve - "there have been cases where people have died" - really?  name one.  Oh, that's right, you can't because it's never happened, and you're pulling that out of your ***.<br>  <br>  Let me clarify - in the last 10 years, I've been to mountains in Colorado, Utah, BC, New York, PA, Vermont, about 20 different places in those states, and I've never worn a leash, and never been asked to.|`|5a3bf2514197ad9aaf59ea9c805d8adbaa	The strap is called a "leash."  You need to attach it to the binding of whichever foot is closer to the nose.  It is worn so that if the straps on your binding would break, the board would still be attached to your body.  A person could be killed by a snowboard that was just sliding down a mountain.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Well while you now know what it is I would ignore Helpful Hank's comment about tossing it out. I have no idea where he lives or what mountains but I have been to at least a dozen mountains that they do check. They dont check everyone but they will check every now and then. <br>  <br>  Its main point is for the lift and before your run down the mountain. On the lift only that one foot is strapped in and the board has more pulling it down then just a ski does. If it were to fall and slide it could cause a problem and there have been cases where people have died.<br>  <br>  So while you may never need it you still might be required to buy one at the mountain you go to if you decide to throw it out. So save some money and take the extra three second to just clip it to your boot at the mountain.|`|AA10040852	The other end of the strap goes around the leg, just below the thigh, it is for safety reasons that it is worn.

yEsw7UkWaa	Like Matt Hardy Fan said, Haters will be Haters.<br>  Some people just aren't happy unless they have something to complain about and John Cena has been a target all though his career.<br>  <br>  At least these guys are honest though. They hate Cena no matter what he's got or doing. They don't flip flop depending on whether he's heel or face.<br>  You always know where you stand with a Cena Hater   LOL<br>  <br>  WQ: The only one I see right now is WWE, so I can't compare.|`|XRw2ux9waa	It's not because John Cena's the champion. People have said this before, the title is like a prop now, and it doesn't mean anything anymore. I could care less if John Cena's champion.<br>  <br>  The fact is, because John Cena is so popular, he's always on the main event. He doesn't have to be a champ to be shoved down everyone throats. The same goes with Batista.. <br>  <br>  If you hate a Wrestler, you hate that wrestler. Just because he isn't champion anymore doesn't mean you still don't hate them.<br>  <br>  WQ: I don't watch ROH, but from what I heard about it, having undeniably great wrestling matches, I'll lean towards that promotion.|`|1UKAho1iaa	The only reason I don't like Cena is because everyone seems to like him for no reason other than the WWE telling them to like him. He can't wrestle that well and his "humor" is really childish. I also get sick of the WWE pushing him our faces all the time as the greatest wrestler we've ever seen, even though he isn't even that good and there are at least 15 guys on the roster right now who wrestle better than him.<br>  WQ: TNA. They're more about the wrestling than the entertainment, and I appreciate the pure wrestling they have.|`|9I4Wle62aa	I don't hate Cena. I hate how Wwe always tries to have him in the spot light. <br>  <br>  WQ: I currently only watch Wwe. So I'll have to go with that. However I'm trying to get into TNA.|`|d2OLxA72aa	As a Cena fan, What I don't like is that as soon as he was healthy he was able to get a title shot, and hadn't even wrestled in months. What about the other hard working wrestlers who deserved a shot. Not only that, but after Jericho lost, he was Never even given a Title Rematch.<br>  Yet the other night, Cena invoke that to Edge.|`|AA12133451	I like Cena. Agreed, its really funny! I guess haters will keep hating him for no apparent reason....<br>  <br>  WQ: I watch WWE. I've tried to watch TNA but I just don't like it. It's just so boring and its not very entertaining.<br>  So, my answer: WWE.|`|1JywgkyMaa	when he doesnt have the title? you mean 1 week every month?|`|e3m3rdNYaa	It is humorous, Haters will be haters though. I hate Edge whether hes a heel, face champion, or jobber<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ-ROH|`|11i3Xmb1aa	I'm neutral about Cena.<br>  <br>  But "haters" are just people who just don't like him. So even when he is not champ people who dont like him will still talk about how much they don't like him. They just say they don't like him it doesn't matter if he is champ or not.<br>  <br>  WQ: I would say ROH. Although when it comes to ranking TNA, ROH, and WWE it would be: WWE,TNA,ROH. Since I don't watch ROH much.<br>  <br>  (:

tzrLDbHWaa	Not a bad team... few changes I'd make.<br>  <br>  Steve Slaton as your feature back?  I would have to take either Adrian Peterson or DeAngelo Williams.  Although Adrian led the league in rushing, his 9 fumbles kinda hurt, so I would personally go with Williams, the #3 rusher in the league who didn't fumble once and led the league with a 5.5 yards per carry, you can't ask for more.<br>  <br>  Your wideouts are a little weak.  No offense to either, but Coles couldnt get 1,000 yards with Brett Favre throwing to him.  He wasnt even the Jets #1 option, so making him one of the 2 best is pushing it.  Moss is great, but getting old.  I'd have to go with Larry Fitz and Andre Johnson, the 2 best WRs in the league, not to mention they're young.<br>  <br>  I;d probably take Tony Gonzalez over Witten, but I can't complain with Witten since he's 6 years younger and you'll have him a lot longer than Gonzalez.<br>  <br>  I'd also have a problem not putting Asomuagh on as one of the top CBs.  He's probably the best in the league right now.  I'd actually probably pick him and Champ Bailey.<br>  <br>  Finally, I'd probably take Rivers over Brady.  I mean, its hard to argue against Brady or Manning, but you don't know how Brady is going to be next season after his injury, and Rivers has been playing better and is younger.  Overall, I can't see anything wrong with either pick, but I probably would have went with Rivers.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Offense :<br>  Q.B. - Peyton Manning<br>  C - Jeff Saturday<br>  LT - Marc Colombo<br>  RT - Ryan Diem<br>  LG - Alan Faneca<br>  RG - Steve Hutchinson<br>  R.B. - Mike Turner <br>  F.B - Peyton Hillis<br>  WR - Randy Moss, Reggie Wayne , Larry Fitzgerald<br>  TE - Dallas Clark , Tony Gonz<br>  <br>  Defense :<br>  DT - Tommie Harris<br>  NT - Albert Haynsworth<br>  DE - Dwight Freeney and Jared Allen<br>  SS - Bob Sanders<br>  FS - Ed Reed<br>  CB - Nnamdi Asomugha  and Kevin Hayden<br>  LB - Lance Briggs, Chad Greenway ,A.J.Hawk<br>  KR/PR - Devin Hester<br>  K - Ryan Longwell<br>  P - Jeff Feagels|`|eEJGGEYjaa	Mine is<br>  QB-Peyton manning<br>  TE-kevin boss<br>  wr-randy moss<br>  wr-david tyree<br>  rb- jemal lewis<br>  <br>  K-david akres<br>  p-feagles<br>  <br>  defense<br>  <br>  lb-bob sanders-antonio pierce-ray lewis<br>  DE-michael strahan(he left :-( ) justin tuck<br>  S-cory webster<br>  <br>  SS-polamalu|`|9ooPYI0Vaa	I agree with most of your picks.

DFUN42S9aa	YES!!!<br>  you would love volleyball.It is so much fun and you get to meet a lot of new people. You get to become close to all of your team mates. In volleyball you learn a lot of team work and hand eye coordination.<br>  I am almost positive that you will LOVE it|`|2SzLx5Knaa	heck yes!<br>  i tried out in 7th grade. i had never played before.<br>  loved it, was awesome at it.<br>  tried out next year; made it.<br>  loved it. <br>  it is so fun.|`|bxgusKAdaa	Ya! i tried out this year and never played before..but i made it, i was in the starting lineup....and you make LOTS of friends. it's a GREAT experience|`|oYGtkVwOaa	its alot of hard work but its definatly worth it.  try out wats the worst thing that could happen|`|VeDJa0m9aa	Most definitely YES! It is a great team sport, not an individual sport. I played and ref for 31 years. Only reason I gave it up was my knee finally gave out. I see so many sholarships handed out to good v-ball players. It's also very good way to stay in shape and socialize. Go for it...|`|1GAtdIvaaa	yes it is so fun especially if your competitive<br>  (i like it when i give people facials (when you slam the ball in someones face) so much fun)

But they will upgrade defensively by returning Merriman so it is very possible. They still need some work on the defensive side of the ball.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	No chance with an aging LT.|`|exOOXAkBaa	Of course, just look around.|`|3isaB96Qaa	Depends on whether they keep LT or not, and i'm pretty sure you can guess which thing impacts which outcome|`|7oZv4KMhaa	Yes, they do every team has a chance.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Anything is possible. There are a lot of teams that have that chance but only one will win it.

sTyRRAeJaa	Chiefs:  No.  Thigpen was heating up at the end of last season and they'll probably wait another year in hope that he'll keep improving.<br>  <br>  49ers:  No.  After getting burned by Alex Smith's suckiness they won't be choosing a QB in first round for awhile.<br>  <br>  Jets:  Yes.  They have no good options at QB now that Favre is gone.<br>  <br>  Vikings:  I want to say yes because they need one, but for some reason they have a love affair with Tavaris so I don't know.<br>  <br>  Bucs:  No.  If they wanted a QB they would have kept Garcia, who's better than 70% of the QB's out there.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Pretty accurate, except the Bucs.  They committed 7.5 mil over the next 2 years to Luke McCown and sent Garcia packing because they want to give McCown a chance.  I don't think they'll be looking for another QB.|`|gF6pgy8raa	Chiefs - No....The Chiefs seem pretty satisfied with Tyler Thigpen at QB and I think he did a nice job for them. <br>  <br>  49ers - I do think they need a QB, but I don't think they should draft another one. Alex Smith was a total mess and Matt Stafford will be gone by the 10th pick, and Sanchez only has 1 year of college starting experience. They would be best suited with a veteran.<br>  <br>  Jets - As a Jets fan, I don't think we should, but I can see them taking Sanchez if he drops or reaching for Freeman.<br>  <br>  Vikings - I think they are better off at picking a QB up in FA than the draft.<br>  <br>  Bucs - The Bucs are a mystery. John Gruden was a QB collector and now that he is gone, I don't know what to think. I'll say they won't.|`|a3f0cd927e0c22a7750e86e460fbf6ceaa	Cheifs-no <br>  49ers- no<br>  Jets- Yes<br>  Vikes-Yes<br>  Bucs-yes|`|3isaB96Qaa	i agree
bHheiqY6aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It is good to know that you are interested as well as more than a billion people do.<br>  click the following link and take your time and explore the A to Z of cricket.<br>  Cheers|`|PmjeWyn2aa	Basic Rules<br>  <br>  Cricket is played by two teams of eleven on a level, closely cut oval “pitch” preferably measuring about 525 ft (160 m) by about 550 ft (170 m). Two wickets are placed 66 ft (20.12 m) apart near the middle of the field. A wicket consists of two wooden crosspieces (bails) resting on three wooden stumps 28 in. (71.1 cm) high.<br>  <br>  At each wicket stands a batsman. If the opposing bowler, delivering the ball from near the opposing wicket, knocks down the bails of the batsman's wicket, the batsman is retired. In delivering the hard, leather-covered ball, the bowler throws overarm but may not bend the arm, and the ball usually approaches the batsman on one bounce. After six bowls to one batsman, an umpire (there is one at each wicket) calls “over,” and another bowler begins bowling to the batsman's partner at the opposing wicket. The players in the field shift position according to the batsmen.<br>  <br>  If the batsman hits the ball with his willow paddle-shaped bat far enough so that both batsmen may run to exchange places, a run is scored. When the ball is hit a long distance (in any direction, since there are no foul lines), up to four exchanges or runs may be made. (If the ball crosses the boundary of the field on the ground, four runs are scored automatically; if it clears the boundary in the air, six are scored.) However, if the opposing team recovers the ball and uses it to knock down the bails of a wicket before the batsman reaches it, the batsman is out. A batsman is also retired if an opposing fielder catches a batted ball on the fly (as in baseball), or for any of several more technical reasons. An outstanding turn at bat may result in more than 100 runs, a “century.”<br>  <br>  A game usually consists of two innings; in one innings all players on each team bat once in a fixed order (unless a team, having scored what it considers runs adequate to win, chooses to retire without completing its order); a game may take several days to complete. Substitutions are allowed only for serious injury.|`|GGuXJJeAaa	what's the point of explaining it to you?  yu wont understand it anyway|`|BFGh2JHzaa	just google it dude|`|AGSvzqMtaa	i dont get the question <br>  <br>  it is a game where people throw a ball at some wickets and some dude hits it with a bat and trys to score runs|`|0Lm6ZLOBaa	You get a bat and a ball.<br>  Someone 'bowls' you the ball<br>  You hit the ball with your bat|`|q34vCB3Qaa	British version of american baseball.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	wikipedia.com/cricket|`|pvEydFxEaa	idk|`|AA11088802	chk wiki|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	The greatest sport played over summer.
0cLj35Fgaa	I think you mean the ruger mini-14.  A homemade silencer (suppressor) will not give you the same level of performance as a professional grade suppressor made by a machinist.  If you want one legally, then you would have to fill out some paperwork and pay a tax to the BATF (the most satanic law enforcement agency).  If you are more of a risk-taker, then you could try to slip a machinist some money and have him build one for you (although you could get in trouble if you got caught).<br>  <br>  My intention is not to tell people what to do with their guns.  Politicians already do way to much of that.  My only goal is to tell you what your options are.  That is why I told you about the benefits/risks of getting a suppressor legally and illegally.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  BTW, if you want to make a home-grade supressor, then you can do a google search for it and find some instructions for it.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	1.  Since when does Ruger make an AR-15?<br>  2.  There is. But don't even think about thinking about it unless and until you find out if such things are legal in your state. and you get approval from the BATFE to make or buy one.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	It doesn't make any difference who makes it, if the bullets are supersonic, there will still be a loud crack when the bullet exits the suppressor. Think: breaking the sound barrier.|`|h6y25GSBaa	i built one (legaly mind you i paid the tax's and stuff) from the documents i downloaded of the pirate bay.org heres a link<br>  <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4569245/Large_Suppressor_(Silencer)_Book_Collection___Video" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4569245/...</a><br>  this was very usefull in my quest for a suppressor.<br>  heres another link<br>  <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/search/suppressors/0/99/0" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/search/suppresso...</a><br>  if you dont mind downloading stuff you will have to download and install utorrent to download the info from the site i listed the stuff on it are called torrents. it should download through utorrent on your computer.|`|2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	While the federal government does not ban silencers or require a license to own them, you need to live in one of the 38 states that allow civilians to make or own a silencer without a license; AL, AR, AK, AZ, CO, CT, FL, GA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MI, MS, MT, NE, ND, NV, NH, NM, NC, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, or WY.  Some states like TX ban them unless they are registered with the feds.  WA bans use. <br>  <br>  You need to send in the ATF form 1 along with form 5330.20, fingerprints your photos, and a check for $200.  It takes about 2-3 months for ATF approval and they never deny approval to anyone who fills out the forms correctly.  You can find the required ATF forms here; <a href="http://www.titleii.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.titleii.com/</a> or go to the ATF homepage.<br>  <br>  There are good forums on <a href="http://www.silencertalk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.silencertalk.com</a> , <a href="http://www.subguns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.subguns.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ar15.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ar15.com</a> .  You can find some drawings or plans on those websites as well as the US patents office website.  A silencer merely consists of a tube with conical, or K shaped baffles in it to allow gunpowder gases to expand and cool.  You will need a lathe to make a good silencer.  The tubing needs to be very straight and the baffles and end caps cut square to ensure the silencer is aligned to the bore and not cause baffle strikes.  Making a good silencer is not hard, I learned how to operate a lathe while making my first silencer.<br>    <br>  Do not expect noise to be lowered to less than 130 decibels, but it should be hearing safe to shoot outdoors in the open.  While the supersonic ammo will make a cracking sound that is not reduced, the muzzle blast is much louder and the silencer will still be very effective if made right.<br>  <br>  Ranb|`|itiLu3dRaa	For a ruger ar-15? Uh NO.|`|L1O3O8pQaa	Agree with RDG78...It is not a wise idea to make your own. there are things you can do to quiet your rifle however it is against the law...and as gun rights are already on the fence please don't give liberal America a chance to demonize owning a weapon. Buy a suppressor legally and be happy with it or shoot from a long way off...then physics and science will do the rest...at least on target. <br>  <br>  P.S.

aaKYVMk2aa	He just got franchise tagged. Although he isn't very happy about it.|`|4JOG5qB1aa	He got franchise, so he wants to leave.  It doesn't necessarily mean he'll get traded because the Panthers aren't just going trade him away.  It's basically going be a standoff between both sides for a while.<br>  <br>  It could be fixed if they sign him to a long-term deal, but for now relationships are rocky, but it isn't certain he's leaving.  <br>  <br>  He picked four teams he wanted to be traded to, all I know one was the Cowboys.|`|BqBL2hqiaa	he got tagged by the panthers, so what will probaly happen since he wants out of carolina and into a 3-4 defense to play OLB. he will probably either be traded for a 1st round draft pick since carolina doesn't have one this year since they traded theirs last year for the pick to get jeff otah.OR he will get traded to the patriots since for matt cassell. which is probably the best bet since cassell wants out and to compete for a starting position(which would be great for carolina since delhomme is so inconsistant) and peppers wants to play for a 3-4 defense so everything would work out.|`|gBfPkdroaa	yess its tru, unfortunatly mr. Peppers wants out of carolina.<br>  <br>  your a tad bit late, but Peppers was franchised tag and wants to be traded to only 4 teams, one being the dallas cowboys.<br>  <br>  the other 3 are 2 from the NFC and 1 from the AFC.<br>  <br>  and i think carolina is willing to trade him for a 1st round pick.

If someone takes a fall and breaks a bone or is otherwise injured the school system can be sued since it happened on their property. Also most skaters that I've seen typically don't wear much in the way of safety gear. I'd willing to bet that if they did offer it as a sport that as soon as people saw the terms and conditions they would have have to abide by (think full pads/helmets, no clothing with questionable logos or words, having to practice every day at a given time,etc.) that there wouldn't be much interest.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Skateboarding isn't a sport.|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	you already explained the reason..because your school already has enough sports...and who are you going to compete against??? now you have to get other school to share your way of thinking and include skateboarding....it would be too much of a hassle...honor the rules and don't bring your board to school...you will then eliminate their need to give you referrals...good luck|`|m7nKg5Fxaa	1.

If you go on the weekend, the full day ticket will be $48 and the equipment rental will be $32.<br>  <br>  So a weekday of skiing at Big Bear will cost $65, and a weekend day will cost $80.  I say call in sick to work on the next sunny weekday and have a great time!<br>  <br>  Group lessons at big Bear are $30.  Your first lesson might be free and come with a First Timers package, you'll want to ask about that.|`|AA10040852	There are many different brands of snowboards, bindings and boots, my suggestion would to go to a ski shop and look around, but be forewarned, snowboards are rather expensive, I've seen some in catalogs that run $3-400 each, and that just the board itself. Lessons are priced according to your ability.
fWMzd7y5aa	They all play a different style. I would say Monte is the best of all three offensively. Rondo Defense and passing. Fisher leader.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	Jordy Farmar|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Rondo because He has more Potential.|`|2eGMXYaIaa	Ellis has the most skills.  I love the Lakers but Fisher can't drive, Rondo can't shoot.  Ellis can do both.  He's just on a bad team.|`|GBGcI509aa	Defensivly speaking Rondo.<br>  <br>  But Monta is the best out of the group.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Ellis.|`|k52P6L0Waa	I say Rondo by so far its not even funny.|`|gPZ7d3mJaa	Rajon Rondo<br>  hes doing pretty goood this season|`|o7RgYN31aa	Fisher with Lakers|`|hgkFByStaa	fisher

Something with lean meat. Go easy on the mayo, though.<br>  <br>  For your lunch, whatever you decide, it should have protein, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and a bit of sugar.|`|FJy9dsuyaa	Well... Here's something good. <br>  *Peanut Butter (No jelly) Also, try wheat bread. <br>  *Banana <br>  *Water<br>  *Cliff Bar. <br>  That should do it. [[:
pXeQFtgIaa	I will support England however i don't think they will do very well. The reason is they get a good manager for the world cup then they sack him for a rubbish manager|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Chabal is back in the French line up. He's knocked 3 players out in 5 years. lol what a guy.    France.|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	On their current form, I would have to say no, but they may finish mid table!|`|3a06298a67f5b113473132c0d29eac28aa	No England will not win the six nations, the question should be more "will England beat Italy this year?"  Martin Johnson may have been a great player but he can't do anything about the natural ability of the players at his disposal.|`|Efns7sDLaa	Good pack but Vickery has let himself go a bit this past year. The backs are all unkowns. Topsy Ojo...... Need I say more|`|pZV0tNw9aa	eh no cant see them winning but then again you never know with sport i guess thats what so good about it! its so exciting you never know whos going to win because things just go wrong for teams some days!|`|sV4knlUfaa	No|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	be lucky to come in top 3    Wales favourites, Ireland cant be underestimated, Scotland will surprise, France will disappoint along with England, Italy will prop up the table (no pun intended)|`|pokTVgdkaa	no way|`|IXsRFlZvaa	no wales defo will! cmonnnn walllllleeess!|`|PJsSpbcwaa	lol u wish it will probly be wales|`|YNYpmhy6aa	No, Wales were easily the form 6 nations team during the Autumn Internationals and look like they'll walk the 6 nations - but it's never that simple. They might get a bit over confident and slip up along the way. Gatland came straight out and said Wales will win the 6 nations.    Also, England have to go to Croke Park to play Ireland, somewhere an England win is highly unlikely.    France are, as ever, highly unlikely but they generally play well vs their great rivals England.      So, on this evidence England won't win the 6 nations, particularly when you consider their lack of confidence, lack of momentum, inexperienced manager and poor form      BUT they could win it - you never know. And that's the beauty of the 6 nations - it's unpredictability.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	And for our next joke!|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	No, I think Wales will|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	WALESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!|`|NmSSKnnWaa	no.ireland will|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	Joke of the week No way and i am England supporter.  Watch out for the Jocks.|`|ETarSy9Maa	No, Martin Johnson isn't a good enough coach.  They will come in fourth in my opinion, behind Wales, Ireland and France, in that order.
6E16tR6xaa	Maybe your the most skilled at the center position. You don't neccesarily need to be the tallest. But, to answer your question just talk to your coach and explain your feelings. I'm sure he'll understand.|`|WPbwiGafaa	because  maybe the coach had trusted you that the team was so good he would put you as center then see wat you would be like in that position|`|XqIqz52Paa	Well first off, tell the coach you're not really comfortable with the spot on the court.  Next, you should be a center cuz a center is usually is the shortest person on the team.|`|xsabcrllaa	ok first go duke i hate the tarheels and jess ur retarted because the center is always the tallest person on the court never the shortest the point gurd is usually the shortest and just listen to your coach bring it up to him if he leaves u there just dont worry about it eventually ull end up where u want to be and on the press tell ur coah to make a press break play so u can avoid the press and wont give up easy buckets|`|cOZIoJdXaa	Confront him about it and tell him you need to play where your comfortable
Btsctjydaa	Go with KY Warming Gel. It has a citrus taste.    It's good for a marathon too, because your partner will run dry after the first 20 minutes, unless he has diarrhea.    You go, dude!!|`|lXE75yQjaa	I'd go with strawberry..or beanus flavor..your choice. Good luck!|`|YBQvzEhGaa	Wow I commend you.  I bought all of the equipment (running shoes, tights, socks, books, gear, etc.) and never made it past a mile.  The store that I bought my equipment from recommended the lemon lime GU but I never tried it.  Best of luck!|`|KjRQysyZaa	Personally, I think Vanilla GU is the best. Like you said, not great, but any other flavor is too much mid-run. I think Vanilla's the best because it's nice and plain and won't trigger your gag-reflex if you're struglling during a run. lol. But, just try different flavors. You never know what may work for you.     Have you ever thought of something other than gel? They sell jelly beans and gummies that taste good actually and they really do work.       Good luck :)  Happy...marathoning
yaMmdhpIaa	Here are some that I enjoy:  Italy v. France  Italy v. Spain (new)  Spain v. Portugal  Argentina v. England  Argentina v. Brazil  US v. Mex.  Netherlands v. Portugal|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Idk. Freshy says one thing and another something else. I do think each has its own peculiar thing that differentiates it.    RECENTLY France vs Italy WAS the biggest rivalry.    Of course there are CLASSIC rivalries. such as England vs Argentina, Argentina vs Brazil, USA vs Mexico, England vs Germany and even before France, Italy's biggest rivalry was with Germany (cue back to 1968 and specifically 1982 WC)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Gringos y Frijoleros        translation:  USA vs Mexico  But then again, it is kinda biased because I've lived here all my life and just am a witness of the intensity  these encounters spur.|`|7Xridrxaaa	Mexico vs USA. There is nothing like it! I am sure my fellow Mexico and US fans would agree!|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	didnt know about it but mexoco vs us is definately good|`|7VwcvLTxaa	France vs. Italy :D|`|Yb0182Vxaa	Mexico vs USA|`|wrhqkEiMaa	You're not serious, are you?    Its Argentina-Brazil.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	I would add Germany v.

Again.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	even though im tempted to say mex v usa because the game has a bigger history than just soccer. and that im a US fan.  i gotta say argentina v england  -they to have history that goes further than just soccer  -and being that it is euro v. south america (even though they are not the 2 best teams) it appeals to everyone|`|VAMEPo0Waa	Mexico vs USA|`|VDh1fcGIaa	Its Brazil vs. Argentina by faaarrrr, IMO =P

sTyRRAeJaa	I say yes also.  Even if another receiver ends up with better stats, I doubt there will ever be one who's more of a competitor, team player, and workhorse than Jerry was.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Yes and by a wide margin.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Absolutely yes.<br>  <br>  The stats say it all, but Rice was about just more than stats. He is the greatest ever; and I doubt another receiver will ever take his place.|`|1beec4f442030ffd8ac1b3802ddf447caa	Yes. Easily the best.<br>  But Don Hudson was probably the most dominant receiver of all time because the Packers used the passing game in the '30s.|`|4amKLnNaaa	Definitely, Not only do the stats and rings show it, but if you have ever watched him play you know he's the best. Also he's good off the field|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Yes he is.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	No. Steve Largent

oNR7il8baa	I'm jealous because of this...     1. Barcelona  v  v  v  v  v  7. Atltico Madrid       What? At least I'm truthful :(( But I still |`|yaMmdhpIaa	REAL, Who?.  Oh, that other club from Spain, claro!  edit: the one with bad coaching, old timers on offense and too many wanna be stars , etc.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	I don't think jealous is the word MJ.    Q2: Real Madrid....I'm not ashamed of my clubs there doing fine besides Arsenal :(|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Jealous of what?  What the hell do they have for anyone to be jealous of?  They can't even win a game without Messi....    Actually we can and have won without Ibra.|`|p1kmZziVaa	And who are those "some people"    I certainly am not.|`|p4H61jQDaa	they are jealous of having "sexy" attacking football + the fact that the club stands for more than just a football club and not a money grubbing team like every other team. For example we pay to have uniceff on our logo while every other team demand millions of dollars to have some advertising log on their jersey. They are jealous because we are more than a club.    i would say madrid but by only a little because it must be an embarrassment for milan to have beckam in their lineup.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	jealous of becouse use have messi,not barca.    he could of came to Arsenal with cesc at 16,if it wasnt a work permirt,remember that ;)|`|VDh1fcGIaa	Everybody here admires FC Barcelona =)|`|TKDi70uTaa	im not jealous, barca are a great club and i like watching them play.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Not jealous of Barca. Just it's being overhyped as a European team (not in Spain where they are beign EXCELLENT) so far. But if they win or get to the final of the CL that would have all been justified. But right now they are not.    LMFAO what kind of fan is one who is ASHAMED of their club?    Real and AC Milan fans have NOTHING to be ashamed of. To the contrary. Were you ashamed all the years you were far from winning a CL or La Liga? I hope you weren't bc anyone who was, esp for clubs such as these, would be a shame to the club colours themselves.    Luckily you are not a Milan fan. And besides your Berlusconi talk on Milan (allegedly referring to cheating or whatever) is a theory with as many holes as gruviere cheese and no proof. Deal with it buddy.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	People are always jealous of the top team.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	i'm perfectly happy supporting my own club i dont need to be jealous of anyone else's but thanks anyway MJ|`|LReOvHEdaa	Yep I agree with Marky.I am jealous of Messi not of Barcelona..but having said that you can say I am jealous of Barcelona as Messi = Barcelona

He won't face either one of them. Undertaker will face Kozlov and HBK will face Austin.  I'm not sure about Edge.   He'll probably face Triple H.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	It was Edge last year so no they had great matches though  HBK and Taker different brands   He will face Kozlov and get rid of Kozlov unbeaten streak(boring)or Big Show(boring)both are a waste of Takers time cause everyone nows he will beat them it should be Triple H V Taker for WWE Championship  or DX V The Brothers of Destruction V Rated RKO where the winners would win the WHC Championship for the winners of the Raw brand and the WWE Championship for the winners as part of SD brand (It will never happen but it would be a great match to watch)|`|mDuiiVN7aa	It looks like he is going to fight HBK at WM 25, but not for the gold.|`|efd05cdfa460b1b80a9744ee53a94758aa	i want to see Undertaker fight with none other than Mr. WrestleMania Shawn Michaels on the granddest stage of them all....WRESTLEMANIA! 2 top superstars in the company and 2 of the best and 2 of the great Legends to battle in their home state of Texas at WrestleMania.

dkTAZmKSaa	okay, well make sure your toe touch is perfect make your arms super tight. it should hurt every time you do a motion. make sure you look the judges straight in the eye. have allot of confidence because that's what cheerleaders are known for. also make sure your toe touch is high. i don't know what grade you are in but if you are doing high school cheer leading then you might want a back handspring if your doing Competition. STRETCH A LOT! Butdon'tt get hurt. practice your motions in themirrorr have fun and be safe i hope you make it.

yEsw7UkWaa	Yeah he's good as a heel, but not as good as Edge or Jericho.<br>  They are the best in my little opinion.<br>  <br>  I think it's a case of there not being that many "awesome" heels in WWE right now. That's why Orton is getting a lot of attention (not that he wouldn't get attention anyway) <br>  The guys that you mentioned are definitely great heels, but you have to remember that they were great for THEIR time. <br>  Randy has learned to lighten up a little in his promos (as you said, he can still be a bit robotic) but he still has a way to go before he hits the stride of Edge or Y2J who are excellent at selling their characters on the mike.<br>  Randy has the attitude tough, and at the end of the day, that's whats going to get him remembered. Folks don't like him because he has made this whole "I'm so much better than you" thing believable.  <br>  <br>  WQ: I would say Chris Benoit and Greg "The Hammer" Valentine|`|1UKAho1iaa	I think Orton is doing a really good job as a heel right now. I don't think he's quite one of the greatest of all time, but he's good. Honestly, I don't even think he's the best heel right now. Edge is. The fans love hating him.<br>  WQ: Chris Benoit

sqfjfR3iaa	You left out the part where you play sports and learn Free-Style Wrestling or Greco-Roman Wrestling while in High School and College. You also left out the part where you wrestle several years in Independent Wrestling Promotions, practice public speaking so you become less nervous working in front of crowds, doing interviews and cutting promos. If all you think is that it takes money to get through Lance Storm's Wrestling School, keep in mind that he and Chris Jericho were the only ones in their group of students to graduate from Stu Hart's Dungeon. Good Luck, this is not going to be easy.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	sounds really cool|`|3icTrKLLaa	There is only one problem with that. Once you got to FCW, they would probably try to change the way you wrestle.

You need to chose friends more wisely; ones that are not getting into fights. You need to focus more on your education so you can communicate better. Friends that get you in trouble are not real friends. Your real friends are the ones who want to see you succeed in life.

Focus at school and train hard in your art. You won't have time to get into trouble and you'll be amazed at the difference it makes in your life.

it2UVkF4aa	No, Shawn Michaels will face The Undertaker for the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania 25, and Randy Orton will challenge John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championchip--in which John Cena will have--at Wrestlemania 25.

g2R7e2eVaa	Yes, it may not always be pretty, but the guy gets the job done. The way he can just shake an arm or a leg and avoid a sack from a near 300 pound defensive lineman is incredible.     That dude just finds a way to make it happen. Just look at that 3rd and 10 throw to Heath Miller during the superbowl.|`|dxeOlRBfaa	NO! BECAUSE I'M A CARDINALS FAN! AND I DO NOT LIKE BEN ROETHLISBERGER!|`|JpvXhgmraa	HELL to the no    Big Ben is so overrated, he's underrated. He runs around the pocket, while his Receiver does the work. That throw to Holmes was an overthrow, but he mad a good catch. He is a big fat slob of grease, and he is only good at handing the ball off.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Not yet, he won two Super Bowls but the team has a top defense and other weapons besides Big Ben.    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|OURb1rnTaa	Dude, good question. You kind of have to. He's got a couple of rings and he's only what, 26?|`|5628ec20b00d1a53d79e14cda6f420f9aa	Don't forget Roethlisberger played horribly in his first Super Bowl.  His rating was in the 20's.  His team won in spite of him.    Lets not get crazy calling him the the next Joe Montana or Tom Brady.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Yes, but only for the same reasons that you would mention Terry Bradshaw amongst the elite quarterbacks of his time... not because they are/were great quarterbacks... but because they are/were the lucky beneficiaries of spectacular defenses... you could roughly put 20-25 quarterbacks in the league right now in Pittsburgh and they'd do just fine. (see Charlie Batch)     All that aside... you can't argue with 2 Superbowl rings in 5 years...|`|G4BSv4jbaa	QB Numbers seperate him from being in the same league as Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, even Drew Brees, Philip Rivers, and Jay Cutler. He does have two rings now at age 26 which is most impressive. I have him ranked in the   6-  10 spot along with Kurt Warner.|`|ojhkApbAaa	Sigh...I hate the Steelers.  Reluctantly I have to say yes.  In the NFL, rings are what matters.  Ben has more than Peyton.  He may not be on the level of Unitas, Brady, Montana.  But in todays NFL, he is an elite QB.|`|p6AZS94Daa	No, I Think Big Ben, is just a product of his team's defense|`|VZlPW5rdaa	1st of all this is to you MR.MVP(bonafide hustler).You said your "on punishment" its obvious your a punk kid  and you have NO IDEA what your talking about when it comes to BIG BEN or football at all for that matter!!!  I get really upset when people try to put BEN down. "HE'S SO OVERRATED,HE'S UNDERRATED" that makes no sense at all kid.  Just watch him.Without a doubt he is "THE NEXT BRETT FAVRE" He might not have the BIG numbers right now,but he's the best numbers in 2 big areas for a 5th yr. QB wins(59 incl playoffs) & super bowl rings (2).Finally he did not over throw Holmes b/c no.10 even said "i never left my feet" & he "runs around" to avoid sacks and make HUGE PLAYS!!!|`|YkseyT7zaa	Sure, I'd put him in that group.  I think the one play they did it for me was the 3rd and very long and he went back, stepped up, scrambled, ran back, spun around and threw a line drive to a receiver for the first down and kept the drive going.  That was awesome and I really don't care for Ben|`|90ZaNZE4aa	not yet.    But soon he will be though|`|AA10939368	Mike Tomlin said it best after the superbowl, Pittsburgh does not get points for style, but we get the job done.  That is what they do as a team.  The reason Arizona received so many penalties is because Pittsburgh frustrated them.      Joe Montana basically said the same thing, when interviewed regarding the superbowl and both quarterbacks he thinks they are both hall of fame worthy.  Specifically speaking about Roethlisberger, he is able to extend plays like no other quarterback ever.  He has two superbowl appearances and victories within five years, three AFC Championship appearances, and the most wins of any NFL QB within the first five years of his career.  He is a leaser for the team.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not yet, but very close. His stats aren't there yet with the other elite, but are very close.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	he did pretty good THIS season but I give him an A minus for a career (so far)|`|UxooffHZaa	He has to be considered in the top 3. Brady, Roethlisberger, P. Manning. Any combination of these 3 is fine, but these are the 3 that can be considered together. Stats are stats, and have more to do with style of play than skill, but they do come into consideration, after wins. Wins and losses are the ultimate decider on how good a QB is.
qaz33UnNaa	ok they are both probably on in the top 5 plays in SUPERBOWL history. we have the longest play in history and what appears to be the best game winning catch. keep in mind james harrison is not a cornerback or a lineman he is a linebacker. Harrison ran it back 100 yards as a linebacker with time expiring in the 1st half. But Santonio Holmes mad an awesome grab to WIN THE GAME. Its not necessarily the catch but also the throw. Roethilisberger threw it perfectly over three defenders. Then Holmes makes a beautiful catch, wins MVP and a Superbowl title. James Harrison's play was nice, but i think Holmes' catch was more signifacant|`|g2R7e2eVaa	That catch was pretty remarkable, but that 100 yard interception return was magic.     I say Harrisons return.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	The game winning catch by Holmes was the bigger play... the fact that the Cardinals battled back and took the lead after the interception return took place, renders the play moot.     There is always the "IF" factor that people will argue how the game would've been different "IF"... but that doesn't matter... it is what it is and the Cardinals had the lead after Harrisons interception... therefore that play did not win the game for the Steelers... Holmes' touchdown catch did. Case closed.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	It's arguable and may never be decided with any definate certainty. imao it was Harrison's return.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	HAS to be Harrison.  - He took points away from the Cards, who were about to score  - He gave points to the Steelers  - Thats a 14 point swing!  - And time was running out! If he caught the INT and only made it half way, steelers still wouldnt of got any points. Time was at ZERO when he got the TD.  - If they only got a field goal things might have been different too.  - He is a huge dude and ran 100 yards, breaking 10 tackles  - If he did that in the 2nd half, he would be MVP for sure.|`|BL4OBp0eaa	This is a really good argument, but I personally think the return was. Think about it... Harrison is a big man. He doesn't just run the ball a hundred yards every game. Holmes is always making the big plays.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	the INT return was beastly!!!|`|nkU7m16Daa	in my opinion, i'd have to say the return by harrison. i'm pretty sure that's the play of the game cuz it's the longest return in super bowl history|`|dxeOlRBfaa	EVEN THOUGH IM A CARDINALS FAN! I'd say the game winning catch by Holmes because without it the Cardinals would have won! I STILL HATE THE STEELERS THOUGH!|`|p6AZS94Daa	I liked the INT, by Harrison. But as far as the Biggest play you gotta go with Holmes because it was for the win.|`|5vg8tC26aa	Holmes' catch because even if he wouldnt have returned that INT they still would have been up. Their effortless defense caused Arizona to come bak in that game, but the catch sealed the deal for Pitt. There were also 3 guys guarding Holmes and Big Ben produced a throw like no other to win.|`|w5sK75MPaa	Return was the biggest no doubt. Think about it if that would not have happened. You have a 10-10 halftime or a 14-10 halftime. That makes a total different second half. The only reason Harrison didnt win the MVP is because of the silly cheap shot foul he was flagged for late in the game.|`|OHc3g97Gaa	The catch. because it was the game winner. The int didn't matter that much since the cards came back|`|ff1c0ca5fa37a36cfd0c5c6f37de42deaa	Harrisons play was bigger, not only did it add 7 points to the Steeler's Score, but it erased 7 points from Arizona's score, it was a 14 point swing at half time, and it is extremely rare for a linebacker to make a 100 yard int return (nearly impossible).|`|FQ0sxhMUaa	i dont really know but i think that the int return was alot bigger because it was a INT return, i mean it hurt the cardinals moral and lets face it... 300 pound guys were not built to spring 100 yards!!!|`|f62og8OMaa	Has to be the int. it's at least a 10 point swing towards the steelers side and possibly a 14 point swing although the T.D. was great pittsburgh would have been in a completely different situation without the int. from harrison.|`|IqK0wcTLaa	I think that Santonio Holmes made an amazing catch with poise by getting both feet barely in, but I think Harrison running that far without being tackled and intercepting the ball was incredible. IDK who, all I know is THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS WON AND SET A SUPERBOWL RECORD!!!!!!!! 6 Superbowls baby!

Sl0UPcheaa	Keep your hands up and your elbows in and chin down!. If you are right handed stand with you left foot in front of your right foot  about shoulder with apart and keep your weight on your back foot. Pinkies out, keep your right hand at about your jaw and your left a little in front of your face.  Jab with your left hand by extending your elbow in a straight line. As you jab push off with your back foot and roll your left shoulder with the punch so that it covers your chin as you jab. Keep throwing jabs and you will control the fight. Jabbing opens up opportunities for rights. When you throw a right you should take your weight off your back foot and onto your front( this is the only time you should do this), and rotate your hips to add power to the punch. After every jab and punch its very important to bring your hands right back to where they were. Use your left hand to block punches and then counter. Circle your opponent but never cross your feet and try to keep your weight on your back foot. Try not to close your eyes when he throws punches at you and you should be fine. Jab Jab Right combos are good.|`|SNllynBiaa	Don't put your head down because then you can't see that you may need to move your head. Try to punch in the nose.

cA4IznZlaa	it is possible to have brakes on your aero bars.  you can splice the brake cable or buy a cable that is already seperated to run to an extra brake cable.  im pretty sure they do not make disk brakes for road bikes so you can not do that|`|Z5xgSATSaa	New fork, rebuild front wheel with disc brake hub, extra weight, all these things need to be taken into account, and the disc brake might not be very safe to use while in a forward aero position, too much weight over the front wheel. It is possible to buy a device that allows you to use one brake from two different levers. That would be a better solution.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Look into traithlon and cyclocross equipment. They offer disc brakes for road use. Otherwise, this is the bike you really want;    http://www.cannondale.com/bikes/07/cusa/...|`|KJHt4hiYaa	You can do a lot of things to a bike if you have sufficient technical expertise but it's excess weight for a questionable enhancement of safety. I use my aerobars with conventional caliper breaks and while it was awkward at first I've gradually come to find it isn't a problem any more.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	ya you could, check websites like instructables or youtube to see if theres any instruction for that.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	This is what you need, there is no need to add a disk brake.    http://www.parktool.com/repair/readhowto...|`|NHIDrNyLaa	yes, but you need disc brake mounts, if you dont have them, you will have to pay 500-800 dollars for some.|`|73t4ijBDaa	Most anything is possible, just not aways practical.  The issues are mounts for the disk brake calipers, the cost of new hubs and re-lacing them to your old rim. In the end it would be cheaper and a whole lot less aggravating to buy a bike with the levers in the dropouts and the cables split and a second set of brake levers located for when out of the drops.|`|jAChLnalaa	You can get brake levers that go on the tops of your bars. They typically don't have a lot of leverage, so they lack in stopping power even if you have good brake units. Beginners tend to like 'suicide brakes' while serious TTers will put their primary levers on the aerobars. Nobody puts 4 brakes on a bike. So I wouldn't recommend what you're contemplating. Yes, you can put disc brakes on a road bike. You'll need to change the fork and both wheels, (they'll be custom wheels, BTW,) and you'll have to have mounting tabs added to your frame for the rear disc. I don't think there are road hubs available to take rotors, so you'll have to use an off-road hub there, which may require you to spread your rear dropouts an additional 5mm (and have the dropouts straightened so they're parallel again.) After all that, you'll still have to buy the disc brakes, cabling, and levers. I smell BIG bucks!
p6AZS94Daa	We are THE Champions.
AA10502115	Keep Duhon, he gets you a crazy amount of assists, something Brandon Roy can't really do. I have Westbrook and he is a GREAT addition so try to pick him up but don't do it at the expense of Duhon. Gerald Wallace is also coming back soon, so I don't think you should drop him either because he is better than both Diaw and Odom. Again, try to pick up Westbrook, he gets points, assists and rebounds. But don't waste Duhon.
ZKikquiOaa	A military person with a gun.    But in a fist fight, it'll depend on what military person and which UFC fighter.  Assuming both fighters are the same build, I'd put money on the UFC guy.  Afterall that's what he does, he's trained to fight with his fists.  A soldier on the other hand is trained to fight with his rifle, take a soldier from logistics, and you might as well put me in that ring, either of us will get pummeled before we can say "please stop".  There are soldiers who practice MMA, but then again, it's not their full time job to do that, while for the UFC fighter, it is their job.|`|1eafc7d2745d873056abda89fd644203aa	a UFC fighter will win if they're using UFC rules..  an experienced military fighter will probably win if he's allowed to eye-gouge, knee-smash, throat-chop, etc..|`|p19oKuVuaa	You never know but I would assume a UFC fighter would dominate.
9NDL5YQJaa	Hughes is 42-7 according to most databases, but there are probably a couple more fights that aren't listed.    Hughes won the UFC WW belt in a slightly controversial slam of Carlos Newton at UFC 34.  Defended against Sakurai, Newton again, Gil Castillo, Sean Sherk and Frank Trigg.  Lost the belt to BJ Penn.    Hughes won the belt back against GSP at UFC 50 and defended against Trigg (for second time).  He then beat Joe Riggs at a catch-weight after Riggs couldn't get down to 170.  Then beat Royce Gracie at a catch-weight.  He then fought BJ Penn for the second time and this time beat Penn.|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Short answer...    He held the belt a total of 4 years, two 2 year periods.    He successfully defended his belt in 7 matches (would be 9 but Riggs didn't make weight and Royce was a non title fight.    He has fought 12 Championship matches... (winning 9 of them, has won the title twice)    Hope that helps|`|S0N3BRecaa	Not sure, but he has over 50 wins and under 5 losses. pretty good no?

Sure there are great incentives for individuals but run in the lines of borderline price gouging for business' who choose to accept the card.  Therefore a lot of business' refuse to except American Express.  <br>  I've been recommended by a lot of people who have purchased most of their snowboard gear from evogear.com.  They have no complaints and have great experiences with the company.  Hope that helps.

The system is different from any other league in the world. We are divided into 3 groups and top 8 teams qualify to the playoffs. What is different from Mexico is that the top 4 in Mexico as of recently have struggled and like somebody said... that is what makes it unpredictable. The Mexican league houses most of the players of the Paraguayan national team. They are currently first place in the CONMEBOL so that shows you teh level we are in. We also have players from Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.  We are definately top 10 leagues in the world.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	not really the mexican league is unique like every other league, the mexican league has been unpredictable because there top teams have not done well<br>  <br>  but like every big league the mexican league has lots of fans and also lots of drama<br>  <br>  lately the mexican league has produce many good players that play in europe and slowly the mexican league is turning world wide|`|6uc8ROfWaa	no the systems r diffrent and it is fun 2 watch and there is a playoff series in mexico|`|Cpm25Pekaa	IDK But ARRIBA MEXICO|`|DO7nz8aRaa	it's different in it's system but it is very fun to watch|`|8zgFyfibaa	I think you should take the time to watch some games then!!!!!

He's going to be gone by 15 orlower<br>  22, Moore is a second rounder he has lost value|`|gF6pgy8raa	I like Detroit taking Stafford. I think St. Louis will take Eugene Monroe, but Smith could happen also. Kansas City may take an OL, but I believe they need defense big time. They were last in sacks in the NFL. There isn't a pass rusher worth taking at 3 so I think they take the best defensive player in the draft in Aaron Curry. 12 is too high for Knowshon Moreno and I think Beanie Wells will be the 1st RB taken, but not till later in round 1. I don't think the Skins will go LB. They have Marcus Washington, young Rocky McIntosh, and Fletcher. They need a DE. Brian Orakpo will get picked earlier than 20. William Moore looks like his stock is slipping. Overall it isn't bad at all.|`|MyuexdrYaa	pretty good but as a jets fan the jets will probably not take a QB like they always do.

rPZFgiwLaa	The Knicks haven't fielded a great team since the days of Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Dave Debusschere, and Bill Bradley.<br>  I was bummed when Ewing retired without ever getting a ring.  Too many off-court problems (Isiah and Marbury).  New York fans are due sometime soon.|`|NJtjJA8Baa	First of all, the Knicks suck even though they shell out about 100 million dollars to the players alone, not including other expenses.<br>  <br>  Second of all, the Knicks are a bunch of bitchy little girls.<br>  <br>  Third, you are an idiot. Who gives a damn about the Knicks? As far as I'm concerned, New York doesn't HAVE an NBA team.<br>  <br>  EDIT: pau "the rascist" gasol, the NBA logo guy is Jerry West.|`|pdbUroC1aa	ummm idk about that I would say the celtics are cause they have more championships the would come the lakers.

I fish almost exclusively Texas rig. In stained water, I've done my best in bubblegum pink, but have caught some on white. In clear water, my top producers are natural colors like watermelon flake, etc. Lastly, if bass are taking baitfish deep and I can't coax a strike with a crankbait, I have tied on both white and smoke pepper worms and caught fish.|`|oXuLtEHyaa	I use the same size hook but I always use red hooks and even red swivels.

AA12393503	Amare's is bigger. The need him right now because they are barely even making the playoffs, i think they are the 9th seed in the West. He is out for 8 weeks which is about playoff time and the Suns need him bad and this was the wrong time to lose him. KG will be back in about 2-3 weeks in my opinion or even closer because its only a knee strain and that isnt that bad compared to a eye injury that needs surgery. Also the Celtics are i think 2nd in the Eastern Conf. and losing a couple of games wont be bad on their resume. So the Suns loss is worse.|`|yrBa2BNvaa	amare cuz the suns need to make the playoffs and they cant do that without him. nash and shaq cant carry the suns to the playoffs. the celtics have ray allen and paul pierce to get them to the playoffs. and kg isnt out for that long anyways|`|5FypDafWaa	Amare|`|Y32OY6PAaa	stat|`|sTyRRAeJaa	amare.  the celtics have enough wins that they can just coast into the playoffs.  plus the celtics actually went 12-2 when he was out before.  plus garnet isn't even the best on his team (pierce).<br>  <br>  amare is the sun's best player and without him i think they'll be toast playoff-wise.  but, if shaq can still put up the stats when he starts playing more minutes, i think they have a chance beating dallas for the playoff spot.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Amare, The C's will still maek the playoff, they have already sealed a top 4 seed. Without Amare the suns will miss the playoffs|`|6vzpHTqQaa	KG.<br>  <br>  The Suns still have Nash, Richardson, Barbosa, and Shaq (and Hill off the bench).  New head coach Alvin Gentry will still have no problem coaching that run-and-gun offense.<br>  <br>  The Celtics, meanwhile, thrive off of Garnett in the middle.  Pierce and Allen are perimeter guys, and Perkins is the only big guy in the middle now.  They also have a good supporting cast, but Garnett will be harder to replace.
cj8iM1Olaa	States do catchweight bouts.<br>  <br>  At UFC 85, the Hughes/Alves fight was at a catchweight because he couldn't make weight. At UFC 76, Rich Clementi fought Anthony Johnson of a catchweight of 177, because Johnson took the fight on short notice, and couldn't cut all the weight.<br>  <br>  Catchweight fights happen. They are rare, but they are a possibility.|`|bYLud3XIaa	Wikipedia has almost never lied to me about that stuff, but I don't know if Ken flo is ready for a title shot, and I don't think that any state would sanction a catchweight fight<br>  <br>  It also says spencer fisher against caol uno, which should be awesome to see.|`|V1qy5G2Qaa	I heard silva / franklin is pretty much going to happen. I am not sure at what weight though. I don't think there will be a catch weight under mma rules in America<br>  EDIT_ This UFC is in Germany.

This is a defensive method avoid answering any such questions.|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Both sides need to quit bashing. Only then will it stop.
iOICjcZcaa	Yeah, I'm sure they love it. When they go to Canada, the fans go absolutely crazy over the Canadian-born wrestlers. <br>  <br>  The Great Khali garners a LOT of fans in India. I'm 100% sure he would not be in the WWE if he hadn't gotten over with the Indian fans.<br>  <br>  I'm Russian and I'm a bit biased towards Vladimir. I love the dude, and a large part of it is because he's Russian. <br>  <br>  I heard Vince was looking into getting more International wrestlers too. He knows he can draw in the money from other countries.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Usually they don't.A lot of the foreign wrestlers are booed and extremely disliked.And well even right now like all the wwe wrestlers from Canada are heels and are booed.Except for Christian,but I don't get ECW in Canada so I don't know if he is heel or face.But all the other Canadian wrestlers are heel: Edge,Maryse,Chris Jericho,Natalya etc.And look how much hate Kozlov gets.The you can't wrestle,USA,boring chants always start as soon as he fights.<br>  <br>  But they do keep those guys so that the percentage of wrestling fans that aren't American will like their character.Like Khali and Kozlov will usually have Russian and Indian fans only really not to many people from the US that aren't of those nationalities like the two.|`|tACz8JjAaa	I think they have top stars from other countries so people from those countries can cheer for that star and have a home star to watch wrestle.|`|f3AdydqAaa	They do that so the international people who watch the show, will acually keep watching it.|`|7ZQT19Szaa	no.<br>  i guess they treat everyone the same. <br>  maybe win a few matches more then others but overall no.

I don't know if you know this but wrestling is rigged. Vince McMahon just pays all the wrestlers and tells them that they have to do what he says. No matter what it is. Also, another fun fact is when a wrestler gets injured he really isnt. when they injure a wrestler that means that theyre over worked and that they need a brake for a few weeks.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	No they don't WANT to loose, but they obviously understand how the politics of wrestling works.<br>  There was a time when HHH wouldn't push anybody he didn't personally like (he pushed Jeff Hardy because it as part of a storyline) but HHH can get away with that cos he is related to the boss.<br>  <br>  I read an interview with Kane and he was asked what had happened to the whole unstoppable monster thing. He mentioned that he likes to push the younger guys because it means that he has a somewhat secure future in the business (for now) and also, ot having the main event status means he gets to spend more time with his wife and step kids. <br>  <br>  As far a s Tommy Dreamer goes, I think his is more storyline than jobbing. I think this deadline he's given himself means that his contract may be up for renewal. Maybe he will win before June, maybe he will just retire. I like to think that the WWE would allow him to hold the title before he goes though. After all, he's been in ECW since god knows when, and his loyalty is impressive. You would think that would count for something.<br>  <br>  Like Lita said though, it's time that both men got back to main event status.|`|tACz8JjAaa	Tommy Dreamers is part of a storyline, Im not sure about Kane|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I don't think anybody wants to lose....|`|kZPFCPHVaa	I hate Tommy Dreamer so I don't care if he retires.

AA12082577	What a ridiculous question.....of course they are!!<br>  <br>  And after this weekend's results, they are now 7 points clear of Liverpool, 10 clear of Chelsea, they have the best goal difference, scored more, and conceded less than anyone in the premiership.....might as well just give them the trophy now!!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	lmao<br>  <br>  They've practically won it, they are walking it without getting out of 1st gear, is it only scousers who can't see that|`|fpbLkbJzaa	Possibly - but those in the know realise 2 'shock' losses could find them in 2nd place - quite likely as they greedily go for 4 pieces of silverware and over-stretch themselves.<br>  The rash of squeaky-bum 1-0 wins shows they haven't exactly been steam-rollering the opposition and if Mouhrino & Co blitz their no goal concession record it could be a timely reality check - to the merriment of all neutrals.|`|706be87ba15de1949576cc5eb6adbe06aa	Unfortunetly they are but the season is long and there are plenty of banana skins for every team to slip up on.<br>  <br>  Up the Reds!|`|AA12370193	I can see you came back without your genuine humor here..<br>  or, well, I can't see how you're trying to say a 5 point lead on Liverpool is not ample.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Yeah,didn't some 2nd rate joker squad relinquish a,what,10 point lead earlier in the season to us?Talk about a death sentence.|`|mK06dus9aa	Yeah, go on Liverpool give em hell :o)|`|xLyNsywiaa	No offense Touz but this has to be one of your worst questions...considering we've played more away games than Liverpool, had a more congested fixture list, had to go to Japan and have had players injured while Liverpool has been the most lucky with injuries out of the top 4 and yet Liverpool are still behind...says a lot.|`|d249327bb8b9be89e88a359ce5e59a58aa	oh touz if it were the other way round you would be collecting that trophy already. better to be 5 ahead than behind, its still all to play for and one of the best seasons yet, sure it will go all the way to the line.|`|zprMdpxZaa	its not a death sentence, liverpool just has to do really good in the next couple games and man u has to do bad in the next couple games but we all know thats not gonna happen...<br>  Man u all the way lol|`|tbgaqgQyaa	yeah. especially seen as though there gauranteed to lose at least 3 of those when we play them.<br>  those two points are not looking so good now are they...|`|bd6a96df906b5e809c2055466b9e83bcaa	Yeah, United are leading by 5 points.

AA10290627	I like the trade. Its no secret in the NBA that Alston has a bad contract. He is no way worth the $5mil a year he is paid. He has never shot over 40% for a year and is not a very good defender. <br>  This trade also clears the way for Brooks who has been a much more consistent shooter and scorer then Alston. <br>  <br>  Kyle Lowry  has been a solid defender and the Rockets genuinely believe he is an upgrade over Alston while he is paid much less. I believe $1mil this yr $2mil next and $3mil after that.   Brian Cook is a PF that contrasts Scola well because he can spread the court when Yao is in the post do to his 3pt shooting. He has very good range for a PF.<br>  Now if R Alston had a better contract we prolly could have gotten a bit more but look at his stats for a starter, they are very weak. 37% shooting. 12pts per game and 5Asts not very solid.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	Memphis got the better deal. Lowrys contract is up at the end of the year and they werent going to pay him big money like another team would, so instead of holding on to him for the rest of the season, they stole a first round draft pick from orlando. <br>  <br>  Orlando and jameer nelson are great for the future. rafer alston is not skip to my loi anymore after the way hes played this season<br>  <br>  Houston needs to rebuild with tmac out and rebuild with kyle lowry at starting point guard along with von wafer. they wont afford yao in 2011 so those days will be over soon.|`|HNQU9V6Haa	houston is a dissaster t mac is always injuried yao just isnt that good he isnt aggrasive enough and now they dont have a solid pg|`|JV8lgDRCaa	two heads are better than one.

I5SypMlsaa	What is BMX?<br>  BMX or Bicycle Motocross is a sport where riders of all ages use manual power to maneuver a bike over jumps, banked corners and other obstacles.  A lap around the track takes approximately 30 - 45 seconds.  BMX was created by kids but it's becoming popular with older racers as well.  Unlike most sports, BMX racing depends 100% on your performance, not the combined performance of a team, or team effort.  Riders compete in classes, and will remain with that class until he/she has a birthday or he/she progresses by first place wins.<br>   <br>  <br>  BMX Racing Facts:<br>  <br>  Statistics have proven that BMX racing is one of the safest of all sports today. Part of this is due to the mandatory safety  requirements. All Riders MUST wear long sleeves, long pants and a full face helmet.<br>  <br>  BMX is an excellent individual and family orientated sport. Races are organized into girls classes and boys classes, then subdivided into age groups and skill levels. The age groups range from 5 & under classes to 36 & older. Within these age groups are three skill levels: Novice, Intermediate and Expert. All riders start as Novices and must work up to the more advanced levels by winning races. A Novice must move up to the Intermediate class after they have 6 wins in the Novice class. An Intermediate must move up to the Expert class after they have 25 wins as an Intermediate. There is also competition in the Cruiser class for boys and girls. The age groups for the Cruiser class are 9 & under to 56 & older<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  How Much Will It Cost?<br>  You can obtain a thirty day trial membership for $25.  A trial membership is good only at the track where purchased.  During the thirty day trial, you can upgrade to full membership for only $25 more.  If you would like to skip the trial membership, you may purchase a full membership for $45, that's a savings of $5 over the trial membership with the conversion cost.  The full membership is good one year from the date of purchase.  Once you have your full membership, points will be awarded to you at each race and you may compete in any ABA sanctioned event.  You can get family discounts signing up additional family members.  Ask your local track manager for more information when you sign-up.<br>   <br>  <br>  What Does My Bike Need to Be Track Ready?<br>  1. Fenders, kickstands, reflectors, chain guard must be removed<br>  2. Must have pads on the top tube, goose neck, and handle bar cross bar<br>  3. Handle bars must have a cover over the metal end of the bars<br>  4. Frame must be in good condition with no cracks<br>  5. Wheel cannot exceed 20 inches (unless cruiser class racer)<br>  6. Handle bars cannot exceed 28 inches<br>  7. Brakes must be in good condition<br>   <br>  <br>  What Type of Clothing Do I Need?<br>  1. Long pants (racing pants are not mandatory)<br>  2. Long sleeve shirt<br>  3. Full-face helmet with chin strap<br>  <br>    How to Get Started Racing BMX:<br>  <br>  Kearny Moto Park is a dirt track approximately 1,000 feet long, with banked turns and jumps of all shapes and sizes. Actually, the first thing you need to do is find the sign-up / registration building. It is there that you'll need to fill out an ABA application and sign up to race. First-time racers are able to purchase a temporary membership for $25, which is good for 30 days. A "Temp" provides you with ABA's secondary insurance and enables you to go out on the track. Entry fees are $10.00 per rider.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Before you get up on the starting gate, it is suggested that first you closely watch the riders go around the track. Pay attention to their body motion over jumps (using arms and legs as shock absorbers) and note where riders are pedaling and when they are coasting. Take it slow on your first few laps. Remember, you are brand new to this and those fast, expert racers started off just like you. Take time to learn the track - know which obstacles are coming up and how to take it smoothly. Often, the difference in the beginner class is who is smoothest around the course rather than quickest<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  THE STARTING GATE:<br>  Since BMX is a "short sprint" sport (with most races lasting 35 to 45 seconds), the start of a race is usually the most important. When you first begin racing, you'll most likely do what is called a one-footed start. Which is having one foot on your pedal and the other foot acting as a "kickstand," resting on the ground to keep you balanced. The majority of riders start with their right foot "forward" (on the pedals). Much like skateboarders or surfers, racers who line up in the gate with a left foot forward are called "goofy footed." Find out which feels most comfortable - there is no right or wrong way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Soon, you will want to learn how to do the normal "two-footed start." Some riders can pick this up on their first day at the races and some beginners take weeks to learn how. You can practice the two-footed start anywhere - find a wall and ride up to it, with your front wheel touching. Apply a little bit of pressure on your forward pedal - just enough to keep your front wheel

The ones here in Texas sell Remington, Savage, and occasionally Rugers.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	John T is correct<br>  <br>  Due to too many mistakes  on the part of Walmart employees Walmarts in California  "gave up" their license to deal in firarms <br>  <br>  In other words they cut a deal to avoid prosecution|`|L1O3O8pQaa	Yes they do. However they may not in your state. They should be out at the sporting good counter...well behind the counter. Anyhow ask them if there is a catalog that you can order from. You pick it out and they will order it, assuming that they sell them where you are. And if it is a gun they carry that has the caliber you are looking for then you can get it.<br>  <br>  Just as well it depends on the size and often the district manager too. I went to a walmart today that didn't carry any weapons in the next town over. Where as the one in my town carries quite a few of them. Good luck. BTW California is a greeat state. I love it there...just the gun laws really chap my 4th point of contact.|`|aJN1d1r7aa	I doubt in California they will sell them at wal mart. I live in TN and they do, but for the most part its just .22s and shotguns. No handguns or any decent rifles. Just go to a real gun shop if you are looking for anything but a starter rifle.|`|luUodcsvaa	In the sport section, our Walmart has a small assortment of firearms. I never took the time to see what they were though.
xetNwrP3aa	if ur black go running back, white go on defense|`|MyuexdrYaa	Your 40 yard time is impressive. If you want to get somewhere with football you gotta hit the gym all the time. If i was you i would pick safety. Defense is so under rated and so much fun|`|FHjZuEhQaa	saftey D wins championships|`|xgqevAgIaa	If you're gonna start pumping up, if the other rbs and fbs on your team are scrawny quick guys, then go for rb. It gives your team one of the best depths at running. If there are tougher guys or a good balance already, go for a safety position as you'll have better chances to start.|`|wf5M2j8Jaa	I would say Safety. You are pretty tall and you can run around the field fast according to your 40 yard. If you say you can tackle I would go with safety.|`|hLOwtAElaa	Looks like your good enough to be both but try saftey.|`|HNQU9V6Haa	be a rb
UoT86gbiaa	You don't say how many teams are in your league so it's hard to gauge overall.  Considering you got both Reyes and Utley, I suspect there are no more than 10.  <br>  You have a good infield and your starting pitchers are pretty solid.  Your OF peters out after Ludwick, but that should be manageable as the season goes.  Not many steals except from Reyes, so you'll want to find another thief.  The biggest problem is that you only have one closer.<br>  This team is about a 7.5 out of 10.  Keep an eye out for outfielders - especially speedy ones - and closers to add.|`|dg7bNDrFaa	I'd give it a 7 or 8.  Your OF is a little iffy.  Your pitching is suspect too after Peavy and Oswalt.  You only got one closer?  You'll need to drop those non-closer RP and get something more useful.

JV8lgDRCaa	rules changed...<br>  you need at least go to college before entering the draft|`|WZvny7mMaa	They changed that rule. Now you need at least one year of college. This rule started in 2006.|`|MyuexdrYaa	i believe that the rules have changed and that players are required to play college ball. Thats why OJ Mayo did not enter after high school|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	As of the 2006 NBA Draft, high school players gain eligibility for draft selection one year after their graduating class has finished high school, but only if they also are at least 19 years of age as of the end of the calendar year of the draft.<br>  <br>  That is the ruling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why the hell did I get a thumbs down in this question? That is the ruling word by word. Look it up.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	The 1st answer is wrong, you cant go to the NBA from HS anymore. They changed the rule. You have to have atleast 1 year of college.|`|X1f4icumaa	nope u can go from hs<br>  like LeBron did<br>  i dont know if they changed the rules|`|7bx2XQlqaa	No.  People think the rule is you HAVE to play college but thats wrong.  There is an AGE minimum now.  Its 19 years old.  Kids coming out of high school can go play over seas for a year of two before entering the draft.  Someone didi that this year, but I don't remember his name.  Not real smart tho, you should play college ball first<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the people who answered before me, trust me you don not have to play college at all to play in the pros.  You just have to be at least 19 years old.|`|ZwRqrou4aa	Everyone is somewhat wrong. You don't have to go to college, but must be 1 year removed from your senior year of high school. You don't have to be 20 or go to college.|`|itozsqvzaa	They changed the rule after the year that Lebron James was drafted.  Now you need a minimum of one year in college.|`|HNQU9V6Haa	they need one year of college if they didnt yu think durant beasley oden mayo love etc.. would go to college?

Old and didn't produce and waste of draft picks since he was injured. The Redskins got ripped off.|`|Cm86ddQQaa	I think it depends on the draft stock of Michael Oher and Eben Britton, if they do good at the combine the Skins will get them and keep Taylor for 1 more year as a DE. If not then they will draft a DE and release Taylor.|`|sNnMZV5qaa	good news!! i heard on ESPN that jason taylor is staying for at least another year!|`|VoKzvoxKaa	hope so
PbNcLBbqaa	Ok, it's OK.  Very OK.  Sorry, but you can do better than this in a 12 player league.  Here are the flaws, starting with the bench: Get rid of Smoltzy.  I'm a huge Sox fan, but I have learnt an important rule in fantasy.  Don't draft non closers.  Either way, he's starting the season on the DL.  Try picking up a closer if there are by any chance any available.  Next, lets go to your pitching staff.  I think it's pretty dang good, personally.  Johan is my favorite for Cy Young, Webb is terrific, Halladay is amazing, Slowey is fairly decent, and I like Lindstrom's stuff.  Jenks and Fuentes will get you some saves, and while you could probably do a lot better than Jenks, he isn't bad at all.  Now your lineup.  First, utility.  I understand the only reason anybody would draft Taveras is for stolen bases, but he's not worth owning despite the stolen bases.  Other than that, he's such a bad hitter, you should definitely bench him and drop him if there is anybody even OK available.  Then outfield: Crawford had a terrible season last year, and, once again, you can do much, much better than that guy.  Now shortstop.  Furcal is not owned in more than 50 percent of leagues for a good reason.  He is injury prone.  You can do better.  I guess if the elite options were off the board and you needed a SS, he isn't all that bad.  Guillen is OK, but you can probably do better at a strong hitting position like 3B.  It is alright to have him there.  And the same goes for Figgins.  He is a player kind of like Taveras except Figgins is available at many postitions like 2B, a weak hitting position.  He will steal bases and give you a decent batting average.  But power and RBI wise, don't expect anything.  All in all, not a bad team.  Dump Taveras, try to trade for another OF to have instead of Crawford just in case he repeats his bad season, and you should have a decent team there, maybe deep in the playoffs.
sLVGdCOTaa	Is this real? What bunch of beginners would let you get Santana, Webb, and Halladay?|`|zPvxaOYoaa	it sucks balls football is better|`|lIHf3SIiaa	It is a good team. ur pitching isstacked but im not really feelin ur batting lineup. I think you should trade manny ramirez because he is really high trade value andpeople will give up a lot for him. You should trade him and carlos guillen and get like aubrey huff and like torri hunterfor him.  Plus you don'tknowwhere manny is going and if he goes somewhere bad there is no 1 onbase for him to hit in. So my advice is to trade manny.|`|BQ3TsQ34aa	Good starting pitchers, plus lots of SB = fairly decent to avearge team in h2h.  You may win K, SB, runs, Wins, Era, and compete with Whip,  Steals.|`|jLalpJbAaa	great team i like tht u got rich hill who could very well get 15 wins and alot of ks...i think your good i wouldnt go out and make trades unless someone offers u a deal u cant refuse...navarro will get u good stats|`|zphPRFrTaa	awesome.
fKco44yxaa	Meh....<br>  <br>  Short Answer - Yes<br>  Long Answer - No<br>  <br>  Short Answer (longer :P) - Forearm muscles are good for parkour, the more you have the better and the better the grip the better<br>  <br>  Long Answer (explained) - Basically Parkour is very hands on...you need strength, but i wouldn't tell you to go do a weights session to get the strength...the same with the 'grip master'. While grip is needed, and using it isn't going to kill you the best way to improve grip strength and forearm strength is to do chin ups, pull ups, muscle ups etc<br>  <br>  I hope that helped
bokDI7QRaa	Kirk Hinrich and Jamario Moon|`|BRX96ZUnaa	Well my favorite team are the Warriors. If I was their head coach, I would play Brandan Wright, Anthony Randolph, and Marco Belinelli because their all young players with potiental. They do not have much experience because they do not get time, so I would play them so they'll be better in the future.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	I would do this <br>  <br>  1st qtr: Kobe,gasol,fisher,ariza,sahsa <br>  2nd qtr: kobe gasol fisher fodan farmer,<br>  3rd qtr:powell ariza jordan famer luke<br>  4th kobe gasol fisher farmar  josh powell<br>  <br>   so its kobe and gasol with tie!!|`|9UhoUcM2aa	i agree with the guy up above me....Wally Szczerbiak|`|reIMLCKkaa	I would start Ariza, bring Brown and Morrison off the bench then bury Luke and Sasha as 3rd option|`|csKyqot0aa	Wally Szczerbiak.

AA10259042	They are pretty big binoculars.  The trick to seeing the night sky is viewing it from a dark location more than anything else.  You can get a pair of Barska 25-125x80 binoculars for about $180.  Or a pair of Celestron 25x100 binoculars for about $280. Or a pair of Zumell 20x80 binoculars for about $75.  But that is not the end of your cost. You are going to need a tripod to hold them.  Not just any tripod will do.  You need a big tripod.  You might be able to get one for about $120.  Weight? They are not light. About 10 pounds. <br>  You should be able to see maybe 10 to 20 galaxies, comets will be a piece of cake, Uranus for sure, with some imagination you should be able to make out the rings of Saturn but higher magnification might be required. Many nebulas, star clusters.  4 moons of Jupiter, and maybe also 4 of Saturn.<br>  <br>  I think you might possibly be happier with a telescope unless you are planning on hunting for comets. About the same price actually.|`|ZKikquiOaa	I actually wouldn't touch that bino.  It'll be so dim that you won't see much of the sky at all.  100 might sound like a big lens, until you pair it with such high magnification.  It's ok to look at the moon, but you need to mount that on a tripod.  Better off buying an actual telescope for the money.
A1eBCQziaa	lol vany Don't get gumballs they are not good as orangatangs!<br>  If you don't know when you have square wheels and you wanna slide, your wheels have to be "Broken-in" which means you cannot slide when you first buy it.You have to do some serious hard pumping,carving, colemen slide, check slide, and more. If you also mess up your wheels will break in weirdly. It takes some time to break them in. I ride about 5-10 miles a day and took me few weeks.<br>  Also you don't need like 90a wheels higher or whatever its all your legs power and skill. I slide my 76a gel wheels which took me like month to learn.<br>  Also check out www.Muirsurf.com they have better deal.I would recommand your setup should be vany or dervish with randal 180 black with orangatang in heat 80a or 03a (your choice has no difference expt color) and its way cheaper.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Need harder wheels, at least 90a.  Soft wheels are difficult to slide on.|`|AA10684395	you can slide with that board, but I wouldn't go with that setup at all.  Sliding is about as scientific as the Bible, and i mean that in a nice way.  Ok, so you can slide with that setup, but it will be difficult and take a long time and  alot of work to learn with those wheels.  Also, gumballs v orangutangs is totally preference.  The Orangatangs are conical wheels with angled edges, meaning they are made to not slide. The square edged wheels on gumballs are actually better for sliding because they have not only a smaller contact patch but "rounder" edges.  They both basically suck for technical sliding, but are good at power sliding and controlling speed in races.  If you want to get some longboard wheels that aren't dedicated to sliding, but allow you to do some technical stuff, definitely go with abec11 strikers around 85a.  If you want, you could get a regular longboard setup for commuting, carving, and racing, and then an old school deck or slide deck for sliding later when you're ready.  you're friends' old park decks are better for sliding than your regular longboard is anyway.|`|lKJT7NKuaa	Yeah, that looks pretty good.

Have loved it ever since.|`|uuHrf7cGaa	Bro. Rehman, I have been watching International Cricket since I was young (6-7years) - in the beginning it was through Radio Commentary and/or watching live in the Cricket Stadium  mostly in Bangalore. I lost contact since I moved to US in early 1986 until Internet allowed me to get back into(around 1996). Since then I have been following the games over internet - but had lost interest during the match fixing scandals. Even today I do not believe this sport is entirely clean - there is lot of dirty laundry that needs to be cleaned and it will never be(as I call tell you for sure the gambling and betting rings started as early as 1978 - when India played Pak - I remember betting was so high that they even bet on toss, who bats first and so on). Cricket has become a business model and it is more of capitalism rather than talent or true sport should be. But even with those hiccups of the sports - I still watch test, odi and 20/20 games whenever I can and follow with Internet news.<br>  <br>  Indians were never into Cricket in my early days even though I watched, played the game. Hockey and Soccer were the sports Indians loved to watch and play. Since 1971 the first away victory by India in WI followed with another away series victory against England made India change the game. Of course 1983 WC victory took it to a different level. Since then - India has never looked back and their main rivalry was against Pak. Whether it was cricket or hockey it did not matter - Most young Indians wanted India to beat Pak irrespective of how talented the team was. But I was different, I wanted the best playing team to win and I supported all teams except England. Some how England was never my favorite and I hated mostly because of their colonial regimes and what they had done on my family. Even today I watch them play - but I support their opponent. But individual players I still respect them but not collectively.<br>  <br>  Having said what I mentioned, I loved it and was praying that the WI last pair will repeat the same as they did against India. It worked out and I was very happy for WI. Looking forward to Pak-SL and Ind-NZ series as well.|`|nwZD5mzRaa	Growing up in a family where everyone loved the sport, it was impossible not to get involved. I started watching cricket when I was around 6 or 7 years(maybe earlier, I'm not sure) but I regularly started following cricket after the '99 WC. I mostly watch just the India matches. And even though I try, it's difficult to follow each and every match that India play, I've missed a lot of them :(|`|kecdkv6jaa	I have been following cricket (and rugby league for that matter) my whole life since my dad signed be up in the local team at age 8.<br>  Obviously i didn't watch as much international cricket as a young lad but i have always had an interest in it.<br>  <br>  I have always loved sport my whole life and my passion for cricket is hereditary.<br>  All the physical activity i participate will probably take a huge toll on my body when i'm older....but what can you do!|`|b9C8CKo1aa	I started watching Cricket from My first Standard (when i was 6) then India was touring Australia just before 1992 World Cup.I still remember those games.

SkN2NqpGaa	There are many resources available, both on-line and off-line, for learning how to make a usable bow. Here are what I consider the websites and forums with the most detailed information:<br>  <br>  Internet forums to visit:<br>  <a href="http://paleoplanet69529.yuku.com/" rel="nofollow">http://paleoplanet69529.yuku.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.primitivearcher.com/smf/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.primitivearcher.com/smf/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://tradgang.com/" rel="nofollow">http://tradgang.com/</a><br>  Some of the world's best bowyers are members of those three forums, which is why I consider them to be the best sources of bow making information (other than certain books). And as has been mentioned, there is the Bowyer's Den; do a web-search for it.<br>  <br>  Websites to go to:<br>  <a href="http://primitiveways.com/" rel="nofollow">http://primitiveways.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://wwmag.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wwmag.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wildwoodsurvival.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildwoodsurvival.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://stoneageskills.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://stoneageskills.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  There are also many books available on bow making. The most useful, and highly recommended (by the most well-known bowyers, for example) are the "Traditional Bowyer's Bible" series, currently in 4 volumes. Also there is "Bows and Arrows of the Native Americans", by Jim Hamm (one of the authors and editors of the TBB). There are many more books available, as well:<br>  <a href="http://boisdarcpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://boisdarcpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://horsefeathersranch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://horsefeathersranch.com/</a><br>  The great thing about these books is that you don't have to be on-line in order to have the information readily available -- when you are ready for the next step, or just need to review something, the information is right there on your bookshelf.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and may your bow serve you well!|`|PxrJZMPaaa	If this is the first bow you have made I would buy a bow making kit ad do your research, its tricky, practice a few times first, Maple and lemon wood are the best woods for a beginner, I highly recommend looking up how do it on the internet or in a library, its a bit complicated to explain in a short yahoo answer section.<br>  <br>  As for osage wood, its quite dense and is a bit harder to work with until you get the hang of it, but it makes GREAT bows once you know how to season and shape it.|`|NxCPypdBaa	For a first time bow buy a piece of store bought hickory. Hickory has the most tensile strength of any wood. It is the most idiot proof wood for a first bow. Whatever you build from it will take a permanent set, but it'll be very hard to break. I'd give more info, but I've broken about 4 or 5 and made my kids a whole bunch of bows when I tillered em a litte to thin. It takes real research and practice. Half the width equals half the strength, however thickness of the bow half the width equals 8 times less strength. Take just a little too much out and you go from a 50 lb bow to a 35 in 2.5 seconds flat. I've only managed to make one 60 lb bow. So research, and then break a lot of woood till you get it right.|`|9SU1utcVaa	What i would do is buy at a sports and good store nut i dont go hunting very often|`|zeXMAsF7aa	osage is one ofthe most popular woods to use but I don't know where it grows try bowyers den website  they have alot of good info on this. When you cut the tree you have to let it dry and season before you can make a bow out of it or it won't hold it's shape.

j8kg4oI0aa	Are you wanting shoes to wear during the race or to wear to practices? Or do you want a pair that you can wear to practices and meets? If you want (and can afford) to have a pair of shoes for practice and a pair of spikes for meets then I would suggest doing that. Everyone on my track team (and cross country team) loves aasics, they all say that they are the most comfortable shoe out there and that you can get the most mileage out of them. For spikes, I would suggest either getting nike or aasics (I have a pair of aasics), they both make really good shoes. But you don't really have to worry about the brand with the spikes as long as the shoes are comfortable. Make sure that the shoe isn't too firm by taking the heel and the toe of the shoe and applying pressure, if it is a good running shoe then it should bend fairly easily.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	Not cleats, Spikes, big difference.  If you are newer to the sport go cheaper, and move up in quality and price as you get older and faster.|`|kJDWy3biaa	Running shoes are OK for any event, however they are definitely not as good as spikes for most events. In your case, I would highly recomend purchasing track spikes. There is a huge variety on a website called Eastbay.com, and I would give that website 4 out of 5 stars as far as easyness, low prices, and quality go. If you get their catalogue, there is usually a special section for track and field, as there is on the website too, but the catalouge is a little less confusing. <br>        Well, here is a little overview of track and field brands: NIKE is a great overall brand of track spike, and offer many different kinds specialized for sprinting, middle distance, and long distance, and have several for the 800m event. (Go to Eastbay.com) But the thing with NIKE is that their quality may not appeal to you. I bought a NIKE track shoe and it's kind of starting to wear down a bit. Plus one of the individual metal spikes that go into the track spike got stuck in the compartment of mine. (I'm just saying this so you can get someone's perspective...the spike that I bought may have been defected because of a one time thing, you know, just one of those defects that you will see from time to time. But one of the kids on my track team agrees with me as well, and that is just his opinion. He says that NIKE has gone down hill in general over the years, but hey, there's a lot of options) However, NIKE does make a much talked about track spike made of components from shark skin or something like that, called the NIKE ZOOM VICTORY track spike, and that comes in two versions, and each of them weigh less than 4 ounces. It costs over a 100 dollars, but I assume you would be paying for the quality. Remember, there are a ton of options out there. As well as NIKE, there are brands like ASICS, MIZUNO, and ADIDAS. Out of those two, I would say ASICS and MIZUNO are definitely among the most popular spikes, with ASICS probably being the dominant one, next to NIKE. Among my fellow track athletes, it would be ASICS who would win the popularity vote, I guess because of overall quality. I am seriously not a paid spokesperson for Eastbay, but I would check out that website if I were you. Good luck.

At a distance of 15 feet, they won't spread far, and either will be a deadly load.

Either one would ruin a bad guy's day, but the 000 buck has the potential to ruin a good guy's day after ruining the bad guy's day. Stick with the #4|`|vSuWyrFTaa	Check your email about flechette rounds.|`|dVaN1wIJaa	The 000 triple aught will do most. If you hit a intruder at center mass, its going to be ugly. If you have kids, or a sensitive person you live with dont let them see this. It will rip a hole in them and guts, liquids, blood will be spilling out, and the impact will break all the ribs and/or break the spine. If you shoot the intruder in the head, it will explode, blood and pieces of skull will go all over the place, no joke. But buckshots tend to have more recoil.|`|xboDUtI2aa	You need to specify #4 buckshot or #4 birdshot.  These two loads are very different.  #4 birdshot is NOT suitable for self defense use!  Ignore what others may say about it.  Birdshot is for birds.  It lacks the penetration power necessary to reliably take down a human-sized target.    <br>  #4 buckshot on the other hand is much more suitable in the home security role, and is actually recommended by law enforcement.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	At that range, it won't make much difference which load you use.  I hope for your sake you never have to face this scenario, for some enterprising shyster or extremely ambitious prosecutor may try to track down your computer's IP address, find this posting, and conclude that you're a raging psychopath who needs to be imprisoned and sued into oblivion.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	If you want to completely ruin somebody then get this stuff.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deltaforce.com/catalog/pg31.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.deltaforce.com/catalog/pg31.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ammunitiontogo.com/catalog1/index.php/cName/12-gauge-specialty-ammo" rel="nofollow">http://www.ammunitiontogo.com/catalog1/i...</a><br>  <br>  It doesnt get any better than this stuff......

xhPKkkELaa	Almost any fish is a great addition to your quiver. I ride a custom made twin fin fish, that is one of my all time favorites in almost 43 years surfing.<br>  <br>  Now The CI Pod is an individually shaped board. (Yes, I know CI uses shaping jigs for the rough shape, the the finish work is still hand done). and of course made with typical CI quality.<br>  <br>  Since I don't know where you surf, I can't steer you to anybody in particular, but you don't always get the BEST board for you just buying buying a big name brand. There are hundreds of great local shapers who can custom build you a stick that is appropriate for your weight, skill level and local conditions. Over the years, most of my boards have been made by small time, high quality shapers, and they are really as good as (or superior to) the big name sticks I have had.<br>  <br>  Also, since we don't know if we surf where you do, this kind of question gets better results of asked of guys who surf where you do, and are familiar with how different designs behave in local conditions. Always ask the guys in a good local surf shop first, before you trust the info you get from a bunch on strangers on line.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice. Fish are versatile and fun. . Keep on surfing!<br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a>|`|oX6UCMkuaa	its a fun board go get it!
fHJqqMzLaa	There may be a couple of reasons why you are cramping up while using fins.<br>  1. You may have fins that are too small.  If you are using full foot fins like the ones in the following link <br>  <br>  ( first line far right <a href="http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeling/Snorkeling-Fins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...</a> ) <br>  <br>  and you have wide feet or high arches you will usually cramp up in the arch of the foot or the front part of the foot.  If that is the case then I would suggest getting a more correct size or switching to strap fins which are on the same link but far left on the first line.<br>  <br>  2. The blade portion of the fins you are using may be too stiff.  Snorkelers and Scuba divers use fins that have a reasonable degree of flexibility in the blade area to help reduce stress on the calf and thigh area of the user.  The stiffer the blade, the greater the chance for cramping.<br>  <br>  3.  You may be using improper kicking or kicking too hard..  When using fins the legs should be kept as straight as possible and the kick should be more from the hip rather than below the knee.  If your knees bend when you are kicking then you are kicking too hard.<br>  <br>  4.  You may be low on potassium in which case bananas or avocados will help in that respect.<br>  <br>  The following link will help with how to select a fin that fits your needs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeling-fins-select-the-right-pair" rel="nofollow">http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...</a>|`|4bzZNCYBaa	This used to happen to me all the time. I started kicking from my hips (using your butt muscles more when you kick) and the pain stopped.|`|Fe15PkS7aa	keep your foot or feet straight because i get them all the time and i noticed that every time i got the cramp my foot was bent and when i got to the wall i would put my foot flat on the wall and put pressure on my foot and the pain would instantly stop and my foot would be fine|`|AA11914978	Nothing to add to the good posts above just a tip. If you wear full-foot fins that are a little 'sloppy' on you feet you can get a much better fit by gluing those sorbothene sports insoles into them - the fins suddenly become part of you!|`|753534657a76b780dbede21d82899217aa	this happens to me sometimes, I asked my coach and she said it was a lack of potassium. it work, so I'd try to eat more bananas
WpqwaqcQaa	no your thinking of an air embolism or decompression illness.<br>  <br>  soda might give you gas or make you burp but will not enter you bloodstream.|`|WrDGhduxaa	The bubbles can not get into your blood through your digestive system.<br>  Soda is bad for you and may or may not hurt your running ability.<br>  If the bubbles got into your blood it could kill you.|`|Nh7f8Rojaa	if there were air bubbles in your blood, theyd collect somewhere all together, and then be forced to the heart, which would induce a dry pump, which can be very harmful if not fatal, and can also cause a heart attack, dont worry, soda does not put air in your blood lol<br>  <br>  however soda isnt the best thing to drink if youre a runner, stick with gatorade if you need a flavored drink|`|2gz6ad5kaa	soda dehydrates you. u will run slower with soda.|`|YLndysTwaa	mkayy i dont know about the bubbles in your blood thing but i do know that you shouldnt drink soda and run afterwards.. your times will be slower|`|7PqwM6QXaa	pretty much soda is just really bad<br>  its more of the caffeine that drys up your throat, and slows you down
RjQLB9s1aa	Mate, if you do need to change your butt cap try this; <br>  <br>  I believe there is a trap door.. There is a slot in the bottom of the butt.<br>  It's interesting that the staples are in the small bevels 1,3,5,7 instead of in the bigger flatter bevels... you will have to gently pry them out, screwdriver, pliers, whatever it takes.<br>  <br>  I do not think that this will solve your problem though. A butt cap has no effect on grip size. It seems that your grip size is too big for you. The most common sizes are 4 1/2 & 4 3/8 so a smaller grip size might be the answer. I do not recommend filing down the grip as it would weaken & maybe break, however it may be worth looking for a thinner grip.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to try & use a smaller replacement grip. Also see if you can borrow a racket with a different grip size to still see if you get blisters.<br>  <br>  Possibly also try & use a different replacement grip material, as the material could be causing your problem. See what works for you - as you may need to replace the racket. Best of luck!!
kJDWy3biaa	The people above are a little too harsh. Yes, what they said about your weekly mileage is true (because you should be running a lot more),  but those times that you said are not that bad after all, seriously, because you are only in 8th grade. And when considering the fact that you are only in the 8th grade, there is always room for improvement, always. I'm sure those times will drop at least a few minutes with the proper weekly training. You will see results if you are patient. So, overall, they are okay times. Just keep on working at it, and follow your goals, if that really is a goal for you. Definitely start training for the cross country team right away, though, and don't give up. (I used to totally suck at running, and I got a lot better, so it can happen to you, too, and I'm not even saying that you suck) Remember to get at least 8 to 10 miles of running in a week or more if you can!|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	2 or 3 miles every few weeks? You might as well not run at all! Those aren't very good times, and if you really want to run x-country, you need to start training much more consistently.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	hmm honestly, no.<br>  first, you run 2 or 3 miles every WEEK? I would suggest doing that every single day lol. an average 5k time, for a guy is like, around 21 mins., and for girls around 25 mins. My PR for a single mile is 7 mins., and im a girl, in 10th grade.<br>  keep up the practice!

OrG2fBbKaa	There are several types, one is similar to a cable bike lock, another is designed to work with certain ski storage racks, and some others are a chain and a lock that cinches around the skis and poles. None cost more than about $30. You can also pay to store your skis at a local check stand  that is similar to a hat check. You hand in your skis and pay a fee for the secure storage of the gear.|`|isA4wtnMaa	There's two kinds that I can think of right now.  One is a cable and can be used pretty much anywhere and one is a small rounded rectangle that fits into a ski rack (which are also very common).  I have both, the first is about $25-30 and the second is $18-20.  I prefer the second because it's more compact and more secure.   The cables can be cut.|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	Check this out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rei.com/gear/feature/search/Yahoo/ski%20lock?cm_mmc=ps_yahoo_Action-_-Category%20-%20Ski-_-Ski_Locks_General-_-ski%20lock&mr:adGroup=10966942899&mr:ad=42921624011&mr:keyword=ski%20lock&mr:referralID=NA" rel="nofollow">http://www.rei.com/gear/feature/search/Y...</a>

TDBnUpvUaa	In addition to your coach, check with players on your team -- or even the star players on opposing teams.

y5TTkgFYaa	By most "Bar Rules" you would win.  If you are playing World Standardized/Ball in hand rules (which would make the world of pool a better place if everyone played by) it would simply mean you can either spot the 8 ball and keep your turn at an open table or rerack and break over.|`|yUwBrkqoaa	as long as u called that pocket yes u do win but if u didn't call the pocket u loose.|`|GQ7vXJ8zaa	It is my understanding of the rules that yes, you would win the game.|`|zFTSg47waa	You have the option of re-spotting the 8 ball and continue playing or re-breaking.

0W4SBxwPaa	Really, anything you can hide behind is good. If you have a lot of cardboard, set up some temporary forts or bunkers to encourage moving around more. If you have a lot of scrap wood you can build stuff or just stick it in the ground. post bulletins saying that if people have unwanted shabby furniture, they can bring it your house and then set them up. Or, if nobody objects, just dig some bunkers and use the soil to make more cover area.|`|Dy5qnhLqaa	Don't buy the blow up bunkers they're a waste of money.

Go to a hardware store grab some 2x4's some nails and some sheet wood and build your own!|`|Rkw7vLhPaa	Simple, get whatever you have around the house that you and your friends can crouch behind. (i.e. cardboard sheets, wood sheets, chairs, trash cans, ect.)<br>  Assemble the stuff into random parts of your backyard into sets no larger than two people shoulder to shoulder, and make sure that the materials vary, because cardboard can be shot through.  Enjoy.|`|96wMLm5Naa	Many stores sell blow-up "bunkers", strong durable blow-ups to hide behind. also, a much cheaper option is to use whatever you have in your garage, a large grill, big pool floats, etc. :)<br>  <br>  Set them up where they are varied distances from each other, some very far and A FEW others closer together. (But not too many, that'd be too easy to hide!)
iRhXfrNXaa	Tell her what safety precautions you will take, wear safety goggles...etc.  Also, you might want to call your local police department and ask what laws there are in your town (they differ from town to town).  You might want to tell her the bad things as well, because you don't want her to find horrible false things on the internet(like my mom did).  Another major thing is to show that you are responsible, I was allowed to buy an airsoft gun, but my brother wasn't, because he isn't trustworthy.  You have to read into it, so you have a good answer for a question that can be used against you.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wBYqc7lIaa	tell her...its better for a young (teen) child to be outside enjoying the outside air rather than staying inside play game (who doesnt like game?) ok...and tell her it teaches safety with weps. and teachs to aim...and ect...good excercise and stuff...parents want to hear what good things it will do for you NOT THE BAD!<br>  <br>  ok<br>  <br>  sk8terkidrulez56|`|LLPgGzIcaa	Watch South Park.

GfOR2H0kaa	Dont Know Aye<br>  <br>  He Got Traded To The Kings The Other Day|`|qivUrJ3Naa	No he got traded yesterday.|`|jz09HaE3aa	He just got traded!! For a conditional pick or something. Boston wanted to open a roster spot.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	he is prolly on injured reserve.|`|u2Afg0IFaa	Traded. I'm a Boston fan.
21J0IIZbaa	None of the trades will improve the Kings.|`|reIMLCKkaa	none of them, they all sucked and hurt Sac more than they helped them|`|I71ePk4Haa	Trade 1: Cassell has already retired, but he forgot to tell anyone. Depending on how much "cash considerations" were talking about, I think the Kings would have probably been better off keeping the pick.<br>  <br>  Trade 2: A decent trade by the Kings...McCants is a good shooter, though I can't understand why they would want him when they already have Martin, Garcia, etc... The other guys in the trade were all basically journeymen, and relative non-factors.<br>  <br>  Trade 3: Personally, I really like Salmons, but at least the Kings got equal value in return in this trade. However, I don't really see how this trade makes either team better. Seems like a wash to me. <br>  <br>  Trade 4: Yawn....<br>  <br>  Trade 5: An even bigger YAWN...<br>  <br>  This Kings team is an organization in complete disarray. You forgot to mention they let loose Douby, and Moore as well. I have no idea what this franchise is doing, and I don't think they do either.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	no of the trades are gunna make them a better team in the west.<br>  <br>  just reminisce when Weber and divac were there and how they would almost make it to the next round but then.......... they had to see the lakers. ha ha u know the rest.|`|7ybUYnGCaa	From best to worst<br>  <br>  2<br>  4<br>  5<br>  3<br>  1|`|EKF2HdZKaa	trade 5 because the other trades make no sense|`|jA6OZjIGaa	Trade 1 because Sam can be a ***. coach on the bench<br>  <br>  other trades were made just to get salary cap in 2009 or 2010<br>  but they lose many good players like Brad Miller, so i think not many free agents will be attracted in 2009 or 10<br>  <br>  still, none of these are really good trades|`|hQECmFKOaa	Trade 3 because they got a shooter in Andres and a rebounder/scorer in Drew Gooden|`|PXV0rXsCaa	Trade 3 hands down

All he did was exploit the Lakers weak pick and roll defense. More of this to come in the near future.<br>  <br>  Kobe in the clutch :)|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Completely, just like every game we play we seem to play horrible defense down the stretch. But good thing we have such great clutch shooters as we do or else our record would be closer to the 500. mark.|`|D8IFcgZAaa	im with you cp3 played great but the lakers bench did nothing all game long but give up big leads plus walton made dumb mistakes on D in the 4th ........that's the lakers weakness being consistent on defense.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Lakers played like **** in the 4th quarter, it's funny how the Hornets always make a run at us in the 4th quarter.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I feel like everytime we play them, if we don't built a double digit lead in the 4th quarter we will lose.|`|P93I8CHtaa	we had a bad night so what<br>  <br>  he will rebound from it the next game|`|urqGJPwpaa	Simple fact for you.  The Hornets were +15 when Kobe was on the bench.  We got lucky that CP3 made 2 mistakes on back to back plays.  Also, Kobe stepped up in the OT and Odom got mad boards!  We got very lucky, and Phil needs to realize when Kobe NEEDS to go back in the game.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Wasn't a foul on Paul, it wa son Kobe and it would have been Hornets ball. Paul wouldn;t have tripped Kobe if he didn;t fell after the push. Posey's shots were bad for the Hornets.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	A lot, dude...<br>  But yeah, they did a good job managing a W.<br>  <br>  Even the Laker announcers were talking about how many three's they gave up.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Yea and our defense was horrible
uxregJ0faa	Hells no. They need the big 3. If one falls all of them do|`|xhHfXuKFaa	no. remember what happened when pierce was all they had? they lost 60+ games. ray allen won't make the difference alone.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Are you serious?  Ok, they're 12-2 when Garnett doesn't play which makes me believe they can easily get past the first round.  If they go without Garnett the rest of the season, the worst they will really finish is 3rd, which will give them home court in the 1st round and they'll play the 6 seed.  Philly is 1 game over .500 right now.  They can easily get past the first round without Garnett, but against Orlando, I think they'd have a very difficult time.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Ignorant much to the 2 guys with Lakers in their User name.  They kinda have Rondo now too, and look who they would play.  Seriously.<br>  <br>  Also, if I do remember correctly, Doc Rivers said the Celtics would be affected more if they lost RONDO over any one of their big 3.  Rondo makes EVERYTHING happen for them.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	They are still a good team with out Garnett<br>  <br>  -They have a winning record when he missed games, well over .500%<br>  <br>  -I would still give them a chance w/o him.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	NO way KG is their best player and i dont think Pierce and allen carry a team to the 2nd round|`|sjnzoERfaa	i hope they dont make it to the finals|`|ZaC4Gi1waa	I think they would. They have Leon Powe and Big Baby, they also have Rondo, Allen and Eddie. Also KG hasn't done so good for the Celtics statisticly wise.|`|Vf0g0q8uaa	If he didn't return i dont even think they'd make it past the first. KG really leads that team, and paul pierce really sucks in my opinion considering i never see him do anything... but thats just my opinion|`|19a36be23f663a00c33d3a93bc392c9aaa	no
9aY9TnXHaa	Yes, its a great story BUT, if all they got is a 89 mph fast ball there going to start in the single or double A clubs.<br>     Thet need to learn the rules, fundementals of the game, and maybe a curve ball, or sinker would help.  Never has a pitcher made it to the bigs on 1 pitch.  Its a nice story because there from India, but they wont make it in MLB.      sorry but true.|`|gMTatFZBaa	Well I heard they were two guys who'd barely make a JC team, they were signed for PR and to promote baseball in India. There are lots of guys who play baseball everyday of their lives who throw faster than these guys who never make the Majors. The chances of them making it or nil.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	I'm surprised it's taken this long for an Indian to play professional baseball.   Some of those cricket bowlers have amazing arms.

They are already showing signs of good team chemistry and in about two or three years they could be a playoff team.

JD5NQxeNaa	Great owner for a small market franchise that saw a lot of success making and being the better team in the Finals record wise against the Bulls. Malone and Stockton would go down as one of the most fundamentally sound duos in NBA history and too bad MJ existed. The Jazz remolded when they retired and for it under young talents in D.Will, AK47, C.Booz, and the rest they are still among the NBA's elite when fully healthy. New owner better give Sloan and extension cause the guy is a great coach and if one day the Jazz make it to the Finals again which in 2 years they were close in 07' were 1 game away from the NBA Finals and last year were 2 games away from the WCF. If they ever make it back Sloan deserves to win a championship. RIP Larry H. Miller.|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	he made the utah jazz a fairly solid franchise and team.|`|e9nZrkGaaa	im sorry, im a jazz fan and live in utah and i can't really say anything good about him.

39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	Yes, the 66 has a muzzle energy of 7.3fpe, it takes a minimum of 5.0fpe at impact, with good hunting pellets and a head shot to make a clean, humane kill on a rabbit. <br>  <br>  Much better would be the Crosman 2100, this one is rated at 9.2fpe, and it's a more accurate rifle. The added power and accuracy will greatly increase your range and effectiveness....They both cost around $60 - $70 depending on which setup you buy|`|AA11570394	With a head shot under 15 yards it can kill small game like rabbits and tree rats. Use the pointed pellets and follow local laws.|`|ZP4qNyKNaa	At extremely close range, with a lucky shot. The gun is weak and inaccurate. It doesn't even have a rifled barrel.
D1beU6MPaa	Your Answer:<br>  Find a small training center and a trainer with another rider on staff who is willing to teach you. Work there until you are bored to death, then go to a bigger training center or farm. When you ride at the racetrack for the first time, make sure everybody knows you're new and green. If you ask for help and advice, the veterans will watch you and help you. Accidents happen when new riders start galloping at the racetrack without sufficient experience, or without telling trainers and other riders that they're new, so if you are an aspiring exercise rider or jockey, please don't make that mistake. <br>  <br>  Most jockeys start out learning to do what exercise riders do, and spend years doing it before they ever ride in a race. Many of the same qualities and skills that jockeys need are also requirements for exercise riders, such as: <br>  <br>  concentration and awareness <br>  intelligent bravery and confidence <br>  humility and patience <br>  empathy and tactfulness <br>  dedication and discipline <br>  balance, strength, and agility <br>  What do exercise riders make in salary or for freelance riding? Generally about $10/head for freelancers, and $400-$500/week (about $25,000/year) for salaried riders. Freelancers can generally ride about 8 horses/day, Most riders work 7 days/week, so that comes to $560/week before taxes. Some salaried riders are lucky enough to work for a trainer who pays bonuses several times a year, generally 1% of the trainer's share of purse money earned. Smart owners will make sure that their trainer is paying bonuses to staff based on purse earnings, because this is an important incentive for riders and also for grooms. <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|N4U2oKwEaa	So basically you're saying you want to become an exercise rider.  Even at your weight, you'd still have to lose a few pounds to ride races.  I'm not sure where you live, but your best bet is to find a farm or training center where you could learn to ride.  It's great that you already have riding experience, but trust me, it's nothing like riding a thoroughbred.  It will take a while to become really good, but you'll have a lot of fun.  Good luck!

0yOTpxDZaa	Golf eh?..toughest sport to get to the top in, frustration is really high, you will get frustrated for years to come..<br>  <br>  $50 for 45mins?..thats actually not that bad, considering I use to get free lessons..but i wish I had've listened more intently back then, cause it wasnt till after we moved away fromthe free coaching that I got into it..and the guy teaching us always said that i had a swing like a pro..dang wish I had've litened!.<br>  <br>  To get hight in you're irons, especially you're 3's.4's.5's and 6's, you need to bring you're hips through alot more, cause obviously if you cannot get hight in you're 8iron then you are leaning to far back in you're stance, and so when you follow through,for the hit, bring you're hips alot farther through..and then from that you can bring them back and ajust..<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|woc0kkiQaa	<a href="http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.com" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.co...</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|6Xf0wOgPaa	Sorry to say but frustration is part of learning golf. <br>  <br>  All I can say is stick with it and you will see improvement...I don't want to go into loads about how to get height because this will just come as you start playing more.<br>  <br>  $50 for 45 mins is not a bad price for a pga pro.|`|Yo4EhgmTaa	First things first. Golf is going to frustrate you for years to come so if your not interested in always chasing perfection then it is the wrong sport for you.  Second private lessons are good for basic swing technique but I'm a firm believer that you need to hit the course with a veteran golf buddy to really hone is your particular swing and make it your own.  You will feel more comfortable with people you know then with an instructor who's tryin to teach you his swing technique and taking your money.  So my advise learn the basics but then grab you bag and get out there yourself.  Preferably a weekday afternoon when courses have less traffic and you can experiment.
wXxJUnLJaa	We've had like 2 different starting 2 guards the past month.

UQLNP6iyaa	SEC. Reason: 2 divisions and a national champion can come from either division, as proven past 3 years. An SEC team has been the National Champion 4 times in the past 6 years, 5 times in the past 10 years. In the past 10 years no other conference has won more than 2.<br>  <br>  The reasons it's not any of the following conferences:<br>  ACC - Two divisions, and the far, far, far better one was won by Boston "we don't like championship games" College past 2 years<br>  Big 12 - Baylor, Colorado, Kansas State, Iowa State, Aggies, oh yeah and everyone's defense.<br>  Big East - Do you know that this used to be a REAL conference? When you exist to make Cincy and Pitt look good and Rutgers look respectable, you know it's bad.<br>  Big 10 - Lot of *cough* history, *cough* look good in their reg*cough*ular season, *cough*, anyone can *cough* rise to the top, but *cough* when it comes *cough* to bowl *cough* games, they always *cough* seem to..... *CHOKE*<br>  C-USA/MAC/M-West/Sun Belt/WAC - Over half the teams in every one of these conferences should be playing Div 1AA at best. Sorry Boise and Utah, but you're never going to get the credit you deserve or the respect you crave sitting in these silly pretend conferences.<br>  Pac One - When the worst team in this conference has the worst record in Div 1 football, the second worst is only a field goal better than that, at least half the teams in your single-division conference always come out under .500, your combined out-of-conference record is 14-17 and yet the runaway best team in the conference still can't get out of the conference unbeaten, you have a credibility problem. Especially when everyone in the world is pretty sure that the runaway best team in the conference is paying players blatantly and still only managed to tie for the conference championship 3 out of the past 7 years.|`|omp5Rpqqaa	SEC, doesn't need an explanation|`|z6pdWKa5aa	I would say the SEC, with Big 12 right behind. First of all, there is always a huge surprise every year in the SEC (2008 Alabama, 2007 Kentucky, 2006 Arkansas). In this conference anybody can lose to anybody. Defenses play excellent on the conference, and it is always wacky every week. Plus you've got teams like Florida, Georgia, Auburn, LSU, Tennessee, Alabama and Ole Miss. Also the fact that SEC dominates in non-conference and bowl games. Like when Florida beat Oklahoma, holding a team that had scored 60 5 straight times to 14. Ole Miss, who domimated Texas Tech 47-34 at the Cotton Bowl. Preseason ACC favorite Clemson was dominated in the Georigia dome by Tuscaloser, 34-10. No conference has more upsets than the SEC.|`|ghUm8M3laa	The SEC is in a down cyccle as many teams are turning over quarterbacks, etc in the last 2 years.  It isn't nearly as deep now as it was 5 years ago.  That being said we must consider that nearly every SEC game has some sort of rivalry aspect to it.  The SEC is certainly in the top 2.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick the tougest conference right now I'd probably go with the ACC.  The competitive balance in that league is very even with nearly every team playing at the exact same level of medicority.  Since they're all fairly average every team has a shot to win it all. This makes every game crtical.  Every team plays just a little bit harder and the pressure to win the conference that much greater.  I would rather watch paint dry than an ACC game (boring!) but I can be objective to admit that the ACC is the least top heavy of the BCS leagues right now.<br>  <br>  That's my two cents.|`|dbpq1wGDaa	SEC, they go deep with strong and athletic teams with powerful defense. Many of the past champions or bowl game winners were in the SEC. For example, Florida was champion this year. Ole Miss defeated Texas Tech, LSU was champion 2 years ago, Alabama was almost in the title game, Tennessee was amazing with Peyton Manning 12 years ago. It just goes on and on. While the Big 12 has powerful offense and passing, I find the SEC more competitive.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Nine out of 10 years, it's the SEC.  There is a reason why 7-5 SEC teams often go against 9-3 teams from other conferences in bowl games and are usually competitive.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to be a homer here, but really, year in and year out, it's almost impossible to argue with the SEC.|`|ZX2N5lB5aa	Even though the Big 12 is an extremely strong and tough conference, especially the South Division,I still think that the SEC is the toughest conference in the nation. Over half of the SEC teams, East or West, are almost always in the National Championship talk ( and my Florida Gators won it this year so that's proof enough).|`|PC60YeBIaa	I'd say the SEC's the toughest, academically. It must be. So few athletes graduate.

qOWJQ7hRaa	No, they almost lost the game if not Fisher drew the offensive foul on Chris and hit a big three pointer. I really cant give credit to Lakers for the win. They just played too confident. They were leading by 16 in the third quarter and had a lot of defensive mistakes. They should have played as they were losing when they were leading by 16. It was terrible. Their overtime win wont make up their overconfidence.|`|urqGJPwpaa	I was working out with my buddy during the entire game.  I think I lost my voice from yelling so much.  Hahaha.  I loved the outcome, and I'm so glad Fisher did work the last 25 seconds of regulation!!|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Yea but I thought we were gonna lose after blowing the 16 point lead and then trailing by 3 in last minute|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	yup|`|zoDEqv6Zaa	Yes! Yes! I saw the game and thank you Chris Paul for the bone head play at the end of the game. The Lakers won the game because CP3 charge D-Fish at the end of the game. And they proceeded to let D-Fish made the 3 pointers to the game and win it in the end. The Hornets got this game in the bag but CP3 MADE THE BONE HEAD PLAY and charge D-Fish and enable the Lakers to tie the game on the next play, lol.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Yeah I did, I just wish Chris would have passed the ball on that 3-1 break in regulation. Game would have been over right there, the Hornets would've been ahead by 5 and there was less than 24 seconds left.<br>  <br>  L.A. would've had to start playing the foul game after that.|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Honestly, I did not like the game. It was okay except the 3rd quarter and the overtime.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Yes, especially the late fourth quarter and the ovetime.<br>  <br>  both teams were trading clutch shots!|`|nBqZBbtnaa	Hell yeah! I liked it better when they had 77-61 lead. But intense, down to the wire games like that are always fun, even if you lose.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	very entertaining game but a very bad call on chris paul.|`|tl7fd34yaa	i hate losing but it was a good game|`|iphheJkoaa	Ya it was an awesome game.|`|IUxM3brbaa	Loved the game. Two of my fav teams, and both teams put on a hell of a show. Any OT game with lakers is awesome and when the Lakers win I can sleep at night|`|O5ouUsSnaa	yea a real good game, lotta controversy, and big shots (both Posey and Fish for their teams) tha best player alive Kobe droppin 39. the sweet sound of MVP chants! lol. great game!|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah because the Lakers won.|`|aio6DYVmaa	somewhat|`|D61u7t1zaa	Ya|`|YBbtCXKlaa	What???|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Any victory by the Lakers I enjoy. Not a very well played game but a W is a W.  I think Gasol is out of gas. So is Odom. But no  rest in sight.|`|HLzS2z9laa	hell yeah, the second half was amazing, everybody making the key shots, very emotional
H8u7gMAYaa	I like Felton's game. He is a really tough player, and is only going to get better throughout his young career.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	felton is only putting up better numbers becasue of more  minutes. augstine is a huge talent i belive he should start alongside felton insted of bell becasue thiskid is a huge offensive talent hes a guy capable of posting 21pts and 10ast per game type numbers. and i like feltons 16pts 4rebs and 6astsas well. i think bell has to go to the bench i mean you lose some defense but you get great offense to comprimise for it. then you have a great three point shooter and defender off the bench in bell. If augistine is a starter then this team will be competitive nightly and he would lead this team into the playoffs(if installed into the starting line up)|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I mean he's been putting up better numbers the DJ so he will probably finish the season out as a starter.|`|FlOTIfhbaa	I like DJ but if I had to choose one of them I'd take Felton.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	DJ Augustine is the better point guard.
H8u7gMAYaa	Well by our leader Kobe Bryant raising his game since Bynum went out and Odom taking his game to where it should of been all along.<br>  <br>  And what can I say about Gasol? he has been the most consistent player for us this entire season.|`|fcNY5vLiaa	hahaha they did beat the new orleans they went to overtime and won kobe is the best and lamar odom really helps kobe out you should watch the next game they are kicking butt|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	They have the best player in the world in Kobe Bryant. And the whole team has been playing great.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	kobe+pau+phil+odom+good bench=good team|`|AA11488609	Well, they have Kobe on the perimeter, Pau doing the dirty work down low, and Lamar is a very versatile threat who can play practically every position except center.  That is the Lakers' Big Three and they are scary.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Because they are in a chase of an NBA championship. Phil Jackson, Kobe, Gasol, (the injured Andrew Bynum), and the Lakers bench including the "Cobra" Trevor Ariza have been winning games, few of them really close like tonights game, but the Lakers are managing to get it done this year. The swept both Boston and Cleveland in their series'.<br>  <br>  You should start watching Lakers games again.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I'm pretty sure Stern has the refs in his back pocket and has guaranteed the Lakers the championship, LOL. Just kidding. There depth is real good, there defense  plays solid on most nights and they have the greatest clutch shooter in the game. And there all playing together quite well.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Pau Gasol I don't care what anyone says it's his team, he is the most complete player on the team, and without him they would be the 6-7 playoff walkovers even with all the bench depth they were pre Gasol.|`|uxregJ0faa	Due to trades. Consistency, and pretty much playing more physical than previous. L.A is back on top.<br>  <br>  Plus they are in chemistry|`|urqGJPwpaa	Lol, turn on a game...and you'll see.  Kobe and Gasol have GREAT chemistry.  Odom has stepped up big time this season (basically the last 6 or 7 games).  Ariza has been a defensive beast and once again, our MVP, Mr Bryant, is playing like an MVP.|`|ExVTrokAaa	the regular season goal to have the Leagues best record is one the biggest motivations the team has.<br>  <br>  And when they want to play Defence, they are extremely tough to beat.|`|vJyF8siJaa	the Lakers have chemistry, he got great superstars in the team and very good role players. The coaching staff have done a good job too. That's why Lakers will win it this year.|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Wow! You are missing out the greatest team of the decade by far and it worth witnessing! <br>  <br>  Please don't get behind and start watching some Lakers games :P|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Because Kobe, like him or not (I hate him) is the best guard in the league. Not Lebron but Kobe.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	how come my phone doesnt text me when the lakers win :(|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Our defense and offense has improved a lot|`|fKlZdoPHaa	The Triangle.
13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	i was sorta hoping to hear that he was drunk or something...who beats up a towel dispenser when they're sober?  lol.|`|vnzSTerjaa	he just wants attention, first he dyes his hair, then he throws a towel tantrum, next he will be apologizing for steroid use after lying about it bla blah....
4FYqkVxKaa	lol<br>  <br>  what do you mean he never loses??<br>  <br>  He actually died once.....I think that's losing|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	No because he is superman.|`|66dAMlktaa	he ought to, but then again, who bothers?|`|3teWTOPqaa	he lost a battle but he didn't lose the war, superman is still superman.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Hahahhahahahhahahhaha!
kqP7GwOcaa	I think Jimmy Wilde would beat most, it not all of them, off the top of my head few if any flyweights American or not in history would have been able to get past Wilde's punching power.  If I had to put an American in the ring with Wilde, it wouldn't even be a flyweight, it would be four time Jr. Flyweight champion Michael Carbajal.  If anyone of the little guys in modern history would have had a punchers chance to duplicate Pancho Villa's KO of Wilde it would have been Michael "Little Hands of Stone".<br>  <br>  Carbajal would have been a serious underdog, Wilde was as heavy a hitter as any Flyweight in history, but Carbajal was always one of my favorite fighters.   I think in spite of the size advantage for Wilde, Mike would have had a chance to land a bomb of his own on Wilde.  There have never been a lot of "Great" American flyweights, most American's tend to out grow the flyweight division pretty early in life.
AA12297886	no way............|`|AA11088802	no|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|wPlfPc0gaa	They will not be able beat Australia. Reasons:<br>  1. If it was a 5-day match, I would have considered it as a possibility.<br>  2. SABP XI is a weaker side with no big names; a couple of players of this team were out of form before this match, especially Kuhn who is at the crease with 95 runs.<br>  3. It's a flat track, and Australia will be able to pile up the runs.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	The same thoughts were going through my mind too; these matches, normally have ne relevance to the actual ones, still the psychological impacts can be there.

lkw5ZyDIaa	mike tyson|`|pR0pJNJkaa	Ok this is easy. And, sorry, but Cookie's logic doesn't stand up here. An old Ali could beat his young and hungry sparring partner. Holmes was his SPARRING PARTNER! In both their primes Ali would've murdered him. Holmes went to the dressing room after that fight and cried because he knew he was only beating the name of a legend and not the legend that was. <br>  Tyson beat an old Holmes the same way. This isn't new in boxing. Young lions beating old legends. Think Marciano/ Louis.<br>  If Tyson caught Ali maybe he'd have a punchers chance. But first of all, Ali in his prime would've been to elusive and used his reach advantage to concur Tyson. An older Ali would've used his strategy that he used in Zaire against Foreman and taken blows to tire him out then knocked him out as he became more vulnerable. By the way, young Foreman might punched harder than Tyson. Did you see how old Foreman knocked out Micheal Moore but the younger one couldn't knock out Ali?|`|dh48AkbCaa	ali dances circles around tyson until iron mike can't hold his hands up anymore, then in the 9th or 10th round, ali lowers the boom..|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	Mike Tyson beat up Larry Holmes in 4 rounds. Larry Holmes KILLED Ali. So obvious|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Wow Tyson in his prime was unstopable but i gotta go with ALI. He will float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	ive seen this question before and almost all fellow answerers inclined to pick Ali over Tyson. i would like to tip the scales a little bit on Tysons' side...primarily because Ali recognized mike's boxing ability and even stated than even on their prime, tyson could knock him out. ive never seen Ali praise another boxer as i used to watched him trashtalking frazier...among other/anybody else.<br>  <br>  lets put things into order in every boxers ability and skill as a breakdown.<br>  <br>  speed - we all knew Ali was fast for a Heavyweight, and has superb footworks....and i think tyson could catch up to him.<br>  <br>  power - Ali has devastating jabs, Tysons got the hooks...no need to elaborate.<br>  <br>  chin - imagine Ali taking a punch from guys like Frazier and Foreman? Tyson is a tough cookie too, see how many punches danny (williams?) thrown before he went down.<br>  <br>  defense - Tysons style of defense was perfect for him while Ali's footworks are good in the early rounds. plus he had good jabs that works even at backing up.<br>  <br>  all in all, tyson has the answers to every skills that Ali might have. except maybe for the heart and the stamina. Ali's greatest weapon against tyson would be his jabs (see Tysons loss to Douglas). he could also use a holyfield style to frustrate mike (hit and clinch). but really...he can never use rope a dope on mike.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Mohammad was a Muslim prophet who wrote the Koran. Muhammad Ali was the professional boxer who was the greatest boxer of all time. Before you write questions on the section please try to learn to spell and know the difference between the two.

By round 6, Cotto would be getting tired and Mayweather would then start his offensive attack and it would've ended in the 11th as the Cotto/ Margarito fight ended (minus the cast in the glove).|`|NSgSaspAaa	Floyd would box circles around Cotto and would probably KO him late in the fight.<br>  <br>  Floyd would more than likely win every round, regardless if there was a KO.

CttL3LmBaa	Green Giant?  Ho, ho, ho,  24 Ton.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, please forgive me.  I just couldn't resist.  Give me all thumbs down, but it was fun!  It is very close to 30 lbs.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It's going to be close to 30 lbs like most mountain bikes.|`|CvzYhAwaaa	The 1998 Giant Innova is listed at 27 lbs.  However, that bike being 10 years old may have experienced modifications.  I would find out from the seller what equipment they added on.  Equipment that is not original may weigh more or less.  Also that weight is an average, and will vary by bike frame size.  Most quality mountain bikes will be in this weight range until you get into the higher dollar range, I'd say around $1000.00 and up.
6S8KjBLQaa	Okay, so I like the list you put up, discluding me because my answers suck (but thanks though!). Anna keeps us interested in other things around the tennis world, and posts about the backround of players, there outfits, etc. Rafagirl19 is also very funny in her answers herself, and is very friendly (most of the time LOL). Tennis Lover is a dedicated dude and always, always, always is answering questions..I like djokerfan for the same reason, as he always seems to be answering questions with his own special touch..I'd also add you to the list OIN, for your passion of the game and LOVE for the Williams' sisters..Now this is where it gets hard! I think you missed two big ones..Global Trotter for making the tennis more fun and and interesting with his variety of questions. Plus he always calls me captain LOL. How about J'adore (full in the blank)..She is always the queen of sarcasm and I believe she is quite funny, yet informative. Final one! It either goes to Ju or Rafa is Hot..I'll give it to Rafa is Hot because she has been answering longer..She is always supportive of her man LOL.<br>  And for honorable mention for retro users, there is JAVV, but everyone is forgetting Eric C who was my amigo..He announced his "retirement" to me LOL, the section hasn't been the same without him though...<br>  Good Q!<br>  <br>  Edit- Oh thanks guys! My vacation was actually very nice (kind of cold the last day though 50 degrees brr!)..I'm sorry I didn't get around to informing everyone, the only reason I told Anna because it somewhat related with her question..Anyway thanks for welcoming me back!<br>  :P<br>  Oh you can call me JBP, my name is kinda long haha! And I liked Eric C, maybe he'll have a comeback like all great players/tennis section contributers!|`|u3FqxhY8aa	=) Thank you OIN for putting me on the list.  I miss J.A.V.V. (did you ever find out what his initials were for?) I have so many technical questions that JAVV could answer really well, and no offense to anyone else, but I am not sure if anyone could answer them (let us know if you can we need another JAVV).  Like JAVV's last question was something like "Who was the last person to win a gs with a wooden racquet?" Lol JAVV managed to answer it in a long detailed answer, but I personally had no idea and don't know too many people who would.  I would have to say all of them too.  JB4Prez hasn't really logged on this week but he definitely gives great answers to all of the questions and adds a bit of humor to them.  Anna is our little gossip girl who brings up all of the personal things about the players.  Lol I don't know why but sometimes I just randomly start laughing at Rafa Girl's answers they are so random but related to the question, I personally find them kind of funny.  Maybe this is just a sudden loss of memory or something, but I can't think of who tennis lover is (lol soz don't take it personally).  King is usually pretty good about it and he/she has been participating a lot in the tennis section lately.  To be 100% honest Justine has been bothering me a tad bit lately.  I am personally fine with her having her own opinion on certain topics and things, but it is a little bit annoying when she yells at someone else for liking Maria Sharapova and just calling them 14 if they like her.  Guess what Justine I am not 14 and I like Maria because she is talented, and the draws weren't fixed when she won them so get over yourself!  Also there is no point in saying that a ton of Indian people have accounts, there is 0 proof of this really.  I wasn't really around on Y!A when Dr. D was here so I can't really say much about him, but he must be pretty knowledgable about tennis to have gotten all of those best answers, but he doesn't come here very often.  Lol Ju is a great contributor, and I think she said she is new to tennis, but I kind of dislike a lot how she tends to be a little bias on her opinion (and I HATE her nickname for Novak, no one I know could have stayed on court for 144* weather and yes he should have done more, but don't criticize him for it not everyone is as good as Rafa and Roger all of the time, I am not sure if you remember how Novak got to where he is, he played really great tennis and may have even been better than those two for a time.....).  Ellie is my contact so of course she is a great answerer she certainly deserves to be on the list.  Plus I know you said not to say you, but I have to add you OIN<br>  <br>  Edit:  Oh yeah I may have forgotten to mention a couple of people.  Rafa is Hot is on the list because she is always dedicated to her man Rafa just like Rafagirl is.  I do miss Eric C I didn't know that he had retired from the tennis section.  J'Adore (whatever name she has here) is also another one, she along with Anna helps to give us info outside of tennis about the players.  Global Trotter has been pretty great too with his answers, and I have seen Rookie burst onto the tennis section scene with like a 800 points this week.  Grasshopper (however you have it down) is very helpful when it comes to tennis racquets and stuff.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Im listed as a top contributor in tennis but these days a hardly comment cause i havent got the time and i dont ask questions!

It's been about a month since I stopped opening the Answers Section.  Aside from being busy, I was so disappointed (again) that my idol (RF) failed once again to win the record-tying 14th grand slam singles championship.  Hence, I sort of lost interest in watching tennis on television, and reading articles about tennis.<br>  <br>  You and the others have practically mentioned the real and regular tennis section contributors I have in mind.  But my favorite of course is you, OIN, for your consistency, loyalty and genuine interest not only in tennis, but also in the people who share the same passion that you have for this sport.<br>  <br>  You also never run out of sensible questions and answers.<br>  <br>  I also admire J.A.V.V. for his vast knowledge in almost everything about tennis and the tennis players.<br>  <br>  I also like the other contributors who, although they have their own idols, treat other players and fans of other players with respect.

VBHOiIBlaa	I do not think there is ANY team in the NFL that desperate to take on Michael Vick at this point in time. Taking over whats left on his contract to bring him in when he hasnt played in over a year.

hGF6i3Eyaa	I own the same gun you have, and the remington 150 grain and the Federal Classic in 150 grain is extremely accurate in the gun. But remember, each gun may prefer something different.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Yes. I use a 50MM VX-III. I need it for low light conditions. The correct scope depends upon the distance that you plan to shoot. Unless you plan shooting over 300 yards, you will not enjoy the 4-16x40. Consistently shooting a light weight projectile of the same brand and same powder charge is necessary for accuracy.|`|biPiIIeMaa	I've always preferred Remington for any ammunition including .30-06, but I've never fired a Browning BAR Belgium.<br>  <br>  The scope you mentioned is definately enough for it, maybe a little more than you need. You really don't need anything that is particularly large or zooms in more than maybe 6x or 8x magnification, but should be adjustable. I have a Leupold VX-II 3-9x40 on my R700 and would recommend it for any other long-range rifle, but like I said, I've never used a BAR. If it's anything like an M1A, which is chambered for .308, then it should be fine.

Do some cardiovascular like "light Jogging" or a couple"wind sprints" to get your breathing under control and your legs back.

The two big guys would die from heat prostration.  One on one is not basketball, just as playing catch is not baseball.|`|3teWTOPqaa	not likely, because Kobe will have wideopen jumpers all day but, but Dwight and Shaq can post Kobe up and push down into the paint and get a easy layup. In the end a layup's % is higher than a open jumper's, so the centers will likely prevail.<br>  <br>  Unless there is a heck-a-Shaq, in which case it might work for Kobe.|`|FUoKu13Daa	For those who remember Dr.J, well he had a 1 on 1 game against Jabbar and basically the size advantage was too much and the same thing would happen with Kobe,<br>  <br>  His only chance would be to try and out quick them but what Jabbar did was basically continually got close to the basket and Dr. J could not get any rebounds and if you remember Dr.j was one of the Original high flyers.|`|urqGJPwpaa	I think it's possible.  What is the 1 thing big men don't really have?  Speed.  Kobe has that for sure.  I think we might see a broken ankle, which would cause Dwight or Shaq to forfeit!  LOL.|`|HLzS2z9laa	hell yeah Kobe will get posted up all day, his fadeway and free throw % is not a factor in a 1 on 1 game against a big man|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Honestly, I don't think Kobe could beat them in a 1 on 1.  I'm not saying Shaq and DH12 are better than Kobe, because a 1 on 1 doesn't signify who is better at the game or who is more skilled, but I really don't see Kobe winning here.<br>  <br>  For anyone who thinks Kobe could win because he's more skilled, actually think about the game, like more than just your love for Kobe and everything he does.<br>  <br>  All a big man would have to do is post up, back Kobe down, and make an easy dunk every time.  Don't tell me that Kobe is going to block a Shaq dunk, it's not gonna happen.<br>  <br>  You're all right that Kobe has the better outside game.  You're right that Shaq can't defend his outside game.  You're right that Kobe has more speed than Shaq.  None of this will matter.  In a "losers-out" game they will just trade baskets until someone misses.  Kobe will miss a wide open jumper eventually.  Shaq will not miss an easy dunk.  <br>  <br>  Again, I'm not saying in any way that Shaq is a better player right now than Kobe.  But looking at it unbiased in any way (unlike how some Kobe fans think he can do no wrong), I don't see how Kobe could stop a Shaq postup and dunk, which would be the difference in the 1 on 1 match.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	i see what your saying sometimes i feel unstopable then i face someone who is actually tall one on one then i get humbled lol (even though skill wise i am better then them and on teams and stuff they just have that lenth they have to be a lot taller though like 5+inches) but idk it would be interesting to watch the only way to see for it to actually happen|`|qYQv38c1aa	It's not "heck-a-shaq" it is "Hack-A-Shaq"<br>  <br>  my personal favorite is: "Bang-A-Ben" (Ben Wallace)|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Kobe can do what Shaq can't... make an outside shot. Shaq doesn't have the ability to play defense outside the painted area, he never had to, he never has, he never will. Therefore, Shaq will always drive to the hoop, which is what Kobe will expect and Kobe has a better chance to block or predict the shots before the happen. Kobe on the other hand can make shots from anywhere, therefore Shaq won't be able to read his offensive strategy, Kobe can drive, or shoot from beyond the arch.<br>  <br>  When was the last time you saw Shaq defend a 3 pointer? That's all Kobe would have to do, make it rain with his ability to maneuver around Shaq and his quickness to get the shots off. Shaq is to old and to slow for Kobe, Shaq does not have the movement Kobe does, he can't do turn-around fade-away 16 footers, Kobe can.<br>  <br>  It may be true that your brother who is bigger can beat you. But that's you and your brother, neither of you are professionals. Now put Nate Robinson, the smallest player in the NBA against your brother and see what happens. It has nothing to do with size. By the way, what is this extra tag you threw on the end of your question... "Even my brother thinks..." who cares what your brother thinks. That's your brother, is he an expert analysis in the NBA or basketball field, is he a former NY Knick or LA Laker? Come on...|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah because Kobe is the best player in the world and can shoot and Shaq and Dwight can't shoot.

3teWTOPqaa	rarely do teams do that, mainly because coaches fear that you might foul on a 3-pt attempt in which case you are kinda of screwed, and second of all I think it's pretty cowardly to do that, and I bet some coaches feel that way too.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Depends on the actual situation what I would do.<br>  <br>  Assuming its an inbound play (probably after a timeout) I'd take a gamble and go for a steal on the inbound.  If you get it, game over.  If you don't you'll be whistled for a foul without them ever getting a chance to shoot, so no fear of fouling on the 3.  I'd probably have my center backing up in case we go for the steal and miss completely with no foul, since my center would be the most likely to alter a shot, and leaving the opposing center open isnt a big deal in a 3 point game.<br>  <br>  If you're talking 3 seconds left but the ball is already in play, and I can't set up a defensive play, I'd want to foul ONLY if its a non shooting foul.  I don't want to chance fouling on a 3.  <br>  <br>  Also, consider that your figures may be a little off.  I know that your figures say its only a 20% chance of making the shot, but thats leaguewide, with all shooters, good or bad, and we all know the best shooter doesn't always get to take the shot.  If a 40% 3 point shooter is taking it, its still a 40% chance he'll make it.  It all depends on the team you're playing and who the likely shooter is as to what your real chances are.|`|JqSOfDiuaa	No you do not foul. Chris paul was stupid for even trying to double team Kobe, leaving Fisher open for 3 to tie the game. You saw CP3 running desperately towards Fisher after Gasol faked a pass to Kobe. Let Kobe score or take a tough shot and you're still up one. Chris Paul is still one hell of a point guard, but in this situation I think he had a mental collapse and it cost his team dearly. Don't forget before that happened the Hornets were up 5 with a chance to go up 7. CP3 steals the ball and its a 3 on 1 fast break and instead of passing the ball, like a point guard is supposed to do, he keeps it and Fisher wisely steps in front of him and gets the offensive foul called. That was huge too.|`|urqGJPwpaa	You foul if the ball is beneath the 3 point line.  Think about it.  That will give them 2 points and take about a second off the clock.  If they make both free throws you inbound and take another second or so off the clock.  Make the 1st free throw and make OR miss the second and it's basically over.<br>  <br>  If the ball is outside the 3 point line, don't foul, because you might put them on the line for 3.<br>  <br>  Edit:  And I bet the Hornets are mad they didn't foul before Fisher got that 3 point shot attempt(made) off.

pqDiBj5Laa	Brazilians players drive dancing Samba, Argentinians do it g with Tango rithm.|`|L1QTSErIaa	Brazilian football is a reflection of the country's multiracial society. Brazil's unique style is characterised by much creativity and swing and is infused with various rhythms and choreographies. It is believed that this unique style was developed in the low income areas largely populated by people of African descent. The great "foot ability" that the players had could be traced to the physical coordination and rhythm associated with the capoeira, Brazilian martial arts, and samba which are characterized by footsteps to dance or to play under the rhythm of African drums. Brazilian football is known for its trickery, fast flowing, attacking style of play.<br>  <br>  Argentinian football is greatly influenced by Europe and in particular, England. <br>  Style<br>  The Creole style of football was described as being free moving and more artistic. Jennifer C. Pratt who wrote on the subject of Creole football shows this comparison:<br>  <br>  "One of the most apparent differences between British and local players were their playing styles. The English values of gentlemanly behaviour dominated and impregnated the spirit of the game — they considered their most important aspects as strength, virility and physical stamina. The British expected to find the spirit of the gentleman behind every player. While the English prided themselves in a style that was grounded on collective discipline and common effort, the Creoles (local players) based their style on individualism and the lack of tactical sense. To the Creoles, football was a form of art, while the British executed it like machinery. One was graceful while playing and the other was more in tune with the technicalities of the sport." <br>  Eduardo Galeano shows another aspect of the Creole style of play. The Creole style was meant to dazzle and awe. This was its purpose and many player would come from south America to entertain the world. The Creole Player needed to be well versed in their own language as Galeano explains:<br>  <br>  "the ball was strummed as if it were a guitar a source of music." <br>  "football players created their own language in that tiny space where they chose to retain and possess the ball rather than kick it, as if their feet were hands braiding the leather." <br>  This was the foundation from which the great players of this style would emerge to entertain millions. Many players used this style of play to great success on the international level; arguably the greatest is Diego Armando Maradona|`|hT32vMkPaa	because they aren't trained by the same people, they own have their own individual style of play|`|YbOGOnroaa	Because Argentinians have shorter legs.

The ice rink, open from mid-November through early March, is at the city's cultural epicenter, close to theaters, shopping and museums.

AA10348999	They ran the line on backwards I think. I'm not one hundred percent sure on that, but my guess would be the reason the anti-reverse isn't working is because you have to reverse reel to spool the reel. I'd take them back to the store and ask them to fix it or exchange them if they are defective.|`|16gnzVayaa	I got a strong suspicion that you are holding the reel up side down. When  you hold your rod and reel with one hand, you should be able to see the back of your hand instead of the reel body.<br>  <a href="http://www.wavewalk.com/Spinning_reel_proper_grip_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wavewalk.com/Spinning_reel_pr...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1098/949230958_59a37a4f6a.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1098/9492...</a><br>  <br>  There is a small switch in the back of reel that flicks right and left. Flick the switch so the handle would only turn in one direction and leave the switch in that position. If the handle could turn in both directions then the anti-reverse is disengaged.<br>  <br>  There is a small knob in front of the spool and it was used to adjust your drag tension. Turn it as if you are tightening a screw. Because you have 25 pound test line on the spool, you should tighten the knot so the spool will start giving out lines when you applied 8 pound tension to the line. Drag tension should be set at 1/3 of the line weight.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Am in agreement with Ken ie., sounds like ya' got it up-side dowm.

NJMzhcKhaa	Assuming you have some sort of training in Martial art, preferably a mix of BJJ/judo and a standup style.<br>  By joining your local MMA tournaments, winning and taking names.<br>  A more fast track way of getting into the business will be to join gym/dojo that have good strong connection to the industry. Gym like Miletich Camp, American Top Team, Brazilian Top Team or Xtreme Couture.<br>  In those gyms, if you show talents and good work ethic, the big names in that place won't hesitate to promote you to the talent scouts. Those schools are also the first for Scouts to go to when they want to find new fighters.<br>  <br>  My advice, keep it real, join your local gym, join local competition and reflect on yourself all the time whether this is something that you really want and something that YOU REALLY GOOD AT.<br>  That self reflection is important, if you do well in the local tournaments and you really can push yourself for the training and 100% sure it's for you, then make that commitment with joining those schools that are expensive, but like I said, have good connection to the industry itself and where the talent scout's eyes go first.|`|szcA8CDyaa	UFC and MMA are the same thing.|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	UFC is the company..<br>  <br>  MMA is the sport.<br>  <br>  And UFC isn't just the only MMA organization<br>  <br>  Theres also Strikeforce , WEC , DREAM , K-1 , Affliction etc.<br>  <br>  Either way you have to train your *** off.<br>  Try finding a MMA gym near your area and take up Muay Thai , Wrestling and Brazilian jiu jitsu.<br>  <br>  You should have at least 3 years of MMA training , then try out for The Ultimate Fighter..if you are lucky and you win the show then you win a six-figure UFC contract.<br>  <br>  If not , then you should do a couple of amatuer fights , have a good record and send some tapes to UFC.|`|rRjoTno7aa	UFC is an organization.<br>  <br>  MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is the sport.<br>  <br>  So your question is "How do I do MMA?"<br>  <br>  Type in on google your city and MMA gyms. i.e (las vegas mma gyms)<br>  <br>  MMA is all different martial arts combined.

I had the 3rd pick in my draft and after Hanley & Pujols were taken with the first two picks, I had the chance to draft A-Rod. However i decided to play it safe so I selected David Wright of the Mets. Both are elite third basemen, but Wright is much younger than Alex and has similar abilities. Of course A-Rod has done much more achievements (besides steroids), but I feel Wright is a suitable replacement. Btw, A-Rod got drafted 5th in my league, after Hanley, Pujols, Wright and Reyes.|`|M9JF9qcOaa	They can't suspend A-Rod unless he fails another test or admits to using P.E.D. after 2004 (even then it would be very hard). The steroid confession shouldn't effect his output at all, but if anything it might motivate him to prove people wrong. He has been passing tests for years now so I guess he has been clean for 4-5 years.
EmYNUZcXaa	sounds like you might need to get your skate punched where your toe feels squished. you may also be tying your laces too tight. its no biggie to get your skate punched. usually the guy who sharpens skates can do it for you. you leave your skate with them overnight and they'll stick it on a clamp and it'll stretch the area thats squishing your toe out. i used mole skin, lambs wool, and cosmetic pads (little white sponges) to help with my skate tonge rubbing. good luck. breaking in skates can be pretty painful.|`|mS1lWECiaa	You should probably get them punched. A nice-fitting skate would allow your toes to wiggle around a bit.. And, like my boot fitter said, it should feel like someone is taking your blood pressure on your foot. Which means that it should feel a little snug. And perhaps you are lacing your boots too tight? Remember to lace them medium on the foot, extra tight where your ankle bends, then medium going up and tight at the top.
a9U0aH54aa	Yeah, i would like to see him around, but hes a thug. I think hes a great player, but the media that follows him just gets annoying|`|bIbyAkHPaa	THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERING PICKING HIM UP!<br>  <br>  That is just the media talking.

He is a person with no soul.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	No|`|zNPGaZRHaa	Hell no. That bostard doesnt deserve anything after what he did to those dogs.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	Your Answer:<br>  In a mercantile environment like the NFL, it should surprise no one that Vick will be picked up. After all, we're also witnessing mindless indecision by Jerry Jones, and mindless salary offers by Al Davis. Why? It's one big way for him to "get back at" the owners and management of the NFL. He forces them to spend more by his spending more and raising the bar. Jerry Jones pouts openly in press conferences when things aren't going well. So, clearly, this is not a rational business environment among many NFL franchises.<br>  <br>  As far as Michael, or any human being, I feel all people deserve a second chance - if they demonstrate a contrite heart for his past deeds. He could end up really being something if he loses his ********* and learns to be coached. Or he could be a second large wash-up because he'll prove, once again, he doesn't get it. Time will tell.<br>  <br>  Bringing him into the league does not mean he will be a great quarterback. Learning to use his running ability as a "threat" can enhance his passing game (reference Young, Elway). Whether he ever gains the accuracy he needs to be a strong NFL QB is a separate question. That is what it will take for him to make a long term difference. His accuracy in the past has been awful. How much of that was influenced by his too-frequent propensity to run, rather than throwing off of a stable platform, will be a real key to his future potential. Remember, though, Vick repeatedly lied to his owners and repeatedly got into trouble based on those lies. Whether a tough-minded coach like Singletary can help Michael more than others may be true, but in the end Michael Vick will still be making his own decisions. Would I personally want him in my employment? I would not. The risk far outweighs the opportunity.|`|EtH1r7wEaa	NO NO NO... that's the problem they do something bad enough to put them in jail and its time to get out and okay you can come play again.. please i don't think he should  be allowed to play at all|`|fQIxah8laa	Yes I would like to see him come back to the NFL.|`|keXaF4Puaa	Yeah every team needs a towel boy or someone to clean up after the game|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	I think he should come back. It would make the league a whole lot better. Many teams are struggling because they miss someone good under center. Just look at how the Raven for example went 9-7 then 7-9 with Kyle Boller, then when they got Steve McNair they went 13-3, then when he got hurt they fell to 6-10 i think, then last season they got that guy with the funny name, I forgot, but they ended up in the conference title game. Many teams will get exponentially better if they have a good QB, and Vick has proved he is a franchise QB.|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	The man has served his time and hopefully learned his lesson so he should be allowed to pursue his career. Any team that signs him will deal with a lot of off field distractions and protest by various groups.The Falcons will notreceivee much in trade for him but they need to cut their losses while they can Personallyy I never thought he was that great of a QB just a good to average at best.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	after he does his time and teams want to try him out then yea im all for it. i mean hell the guy was young and stupid and screwed up i think what he did was horrible. but im sure hes learned his lesson. i dont think he would make a good quarterback again though. i would like to see him at running back. now a days teams are looking for a pocket qb not a scrambler ever since teams started using the wildcat offense they dont need a scrambling qb. so i think running back or slot reciever would be good for him. im anxious for him to get out of jail and see what happens.|`|yoytdRGTaa	Once he's done his time and is square with the man, then I don't really care one way or another.  Anyone who thinks differently must be in favor of life sentences for most crimes.<br>  <br>  If a team wants to give him a job then that's their business, not mine.<br>  <br>  I never thought he was all that exciting to watch, anyway, if that has any bearing.|`|N3Ho6dqhaa	I would like to see him stop smoking pot...Really?! Michael Vick you couldn't throw your pot away Really?!   This has been Really?! with Seth and Amy.|`|5j81EoVXaa	yes, he served his time and now should have learnt his lesson.|`|StuXqez7aa	If he paid his debt to society, then I see no problem with him comming back.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	no way, but im sure someone (dallas) will take a chance on him.

Phoenix has a very quick team and they are getting off to a roll right now, don't under-estimate them just yet. Three 140+ games in the past three games! That's ridiculous. Then you have Denver, at home and LA coming off a possible loss to Phoenix the night before! Not only will they be tired, drained, but now a little frustrated with the nights loss, assuming they loss, they're momentum won't be at a high. Especially if they lose by under 5-points. Even if they win, they will be exhausted as the Phoenix Suns are a very hard team to keep up with, then to fly from LA to Denver overnight... its going to be tough.<br>  <br>  Let's not forget although... the Lakers are a tough team... taking out Cleveland at home, to end the streak, and Boston on Xmas day to end the streak, and going 2-0 against both.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	they will win minnesota,oklahoma,phoenix,and a tough fight vs nuggets but they still will.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  nuggets vs lakers is exciting to watch.|`|N5Cnuay0aa	yes, lakers = d' best.|`|bPbJfZJaaa	Tough ending there.

When it comes to doing all of the above, there is no better team than the Lakers.  <br>  <br>  Ariza, who has been our most consistanly solid bench player this entire season, is a perfect example of a good reserve.  He comes in and plays outstanding defense, rebounds well, gets steals, and provides an energy that ignights the rest of the team.<br>  <br>  Farmar, same thing.  He can also come in and hit open shots.<br>  <br>  Sasha, although his jumper hasn't always been there, he plays great D and hustles more than any player on the team.<br>  <br>  Powell has been playing very well lately as well.  He comes in and provides rebounds and even scoring every now and then.<br>  <br>  Shannon Brown fits all the categories for a good bench player as well, which is why I love the trade we made for him and Morrison.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is the bench is supposed to provide a "spark" for the rest of the team.  The Laker bench does this better than any other team.  And we are very deep with our reserves, deeper than anyone else iin the NBA.  We have ten players who play a very important role on the team.  No other team can say that.|`|bPbJfZJaaa	Bench scoring? You do realize that the Knicks and the Warriors are in the top 5 of overall scoring? Care to include other aspects of the game? Defense perhaps?<br>  <br>  Rebounding, passing, being able to seamlessly integrate with the starting lineup when needed? <br>  <br>  There is a lot more to the game than scoring.|`|NwCiQtJbaa	BEST RECORD IN THE NBA...NUFF SAID.
Ar5VHDiBaa	he sprinkled steroids on his corn flakes|`|c6q3EERdaa	Cal is definitely one of the most respected players out there. I'd agree with you, Joker, and say that Cal was the most respected guy in the league. His streak and desire to play and win helped him become a likeable player.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	No. Since he used steroids not to many people respect him anymore.|`|W7BZcdynaa	The media has a lot to do with it. He wasn't that great of a player. If you not friendly with the media they can hurt/improve your image. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying Ripken was a bad player just not prob not tin the top 50 players of all-time.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Roberto Clemente.  These are just a few, but I agree Cal should be in the discussion.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	I would add Derek Jeter, because the guy is a great role model on and off the field and theres no doubt he gives it 100% every game as Ripken did.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	Dale Murphy was pretty respected, Paul Molitor, Don Mattingly, etc.  I never really liked Ripken.  (It's hard to think of someone since the steroids explosion.)  The same reason everyone gave him all the kudos is the reason I didn't like him.  He played hurt a lot, even when he wasn't playing well.  What was worse was that his streak meant that he played even when he wasn't the best player to be playing that day.  His streak was more important than his team winning.  <br>  <br>  Derek Jeter bothers me for the same sort of reason.  He should have moved to second when A-Roids came over.  A-Roids was a much better defensive short stop than Jeter (although maybe it was the steroids).  Jeter's ego kept him from doing what was best for the team.  (Actually, if Jeter had moved the Yankees could have signed Alex BEFORE he went to Texas and wouldn't have had to trade for him.  (And I'm a Yankees fan!)<br>  <br>  It must have been nice to be able to pencil in Ripken every day, but it must have also been frustrating when he was in a slump.  I'd rather have someone like that in my lineup than, say Manny Ramirez, but I'd rather have Ramirez's production in the lineup.  Maybe there is something to be said for taking a day off occasionally.|`|wmYnJd2jaa	I think Hank Aaron, Lou Gehrig, Jackie Robinson, Sandy Koufax, Joe DiMaggio, Greg Maddux, Roberto Clemente would all be more respected. All class acts, and all better players than Ripken.<br>  <br>  And don't get me wrong, I like Cal Ripken. I played shortstop for years and wore #8 most of career because of Ripken. I just don't think he's the MOST respected player in history.|`|2qrX7l28aa	The old timers also but of this era Chipper Jones & Greg Maddux were true winners|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	Yes. But there were mny others. Honus Wagner comes to mind.|`|2a11366e215cea4173347ee04672e254aa	I would say he's the most respected|`|kRJ7Liu4aa	Yes or Griffey JR|`|pChoen9haa	No.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	him or gehrig|`|UsIYpkRwaa	I am a big Oriole's fan and a big Ripken fan. I wish I had it on me to quote some of the things he said (unfortunately I lent it out), but in Cal Ripken Jr's book, "Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference" he actually explains why he went out to the ballpark everyday and stepped foot on the field whether he was injured, sick etc...i feel like people who have negative opinions or have dislike towards Ripken for whatever reason should read his book and see how the 2600+ game streak occurred from the perspective of the man himself who achieved the milestone...and by all means you are entitled to your own opinion but, I have a feeling some might have a change of heart after reading this book.|`|cfmbN4pPaa	I dont think theres any one player thats respected more than the rest. I'd say its more like a group of guys. If ya had to pick one id have to say Jackie Robinson. Should read about the man. Really went through some terrible things. He never stooped to their level( their = being all the racists and such). Wasnt just everything he went through but how he conducted himself on and off the field was impressive.|`|jBXutMblaa	He's my favorite player ever, but I think there are quite a few guys who are well respected in the baseball.  Roberto Clemente and Lou Gehrig are definitely two others.|`|3XFHK7a8aa	Either him, Lou Gehrig or Ted Williams. But ever since the roids it's hard to respect him once more.|`|s5dspNk5aa	He need to take some days off and maybe he would have produced better numbers...in a way it was selfish.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Yes|`|U3KAgO0baa	you have 2 put Jeter in tha list aswell...

NOT HHH!!!! Even Eugene plays more mind games than HHH!|`|77b5BDf3aa	HHH.

When the title is on the line, he is just that damn good.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Honestly, I would say Kane over Taker...and I actually think the right person is stuck with that nickname (Trips).

I felt that same way, on both RAW & Smackdown for Triple H, but then again, HHH does abuse his backstage power, reason why he currently has the WWE Championship. I was starting to like Smackdown, once HHH got out of the main event, MOMENTARILY, then he won the WWE Championship, at No Way Out, which turned things upside down. Although, a plus is featured in all of this..now, we get to see an Edge vs. Cena feud on Smackdown, and Randy Orton defeat Triple H for the WWE Championship at WM 25! ... hopefully, that is. I know HHH is going to RAW, because of what happened on RAW with HHH/Legacy/Stephanie, and Cena to Smackdown, because of Edge.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	people always say that but rating are up when he is on...Take this week for instance, people anticipated that he would be on Raw because of Stephanie and ratings skyrocketed during the second hour of Raw.|`|4sc7bMbkaa	yep you are the only one|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	You are the only one
dcNT65mTaa	That's been the major problem with this era of youth in the WWE. They rely more on story lines than they do their talent and in ring skills. I agree with you totally, it shouldn't take getting a push to become a great superstar but more often these days, athletes like Cena come along who have all the muscle, all the making of what could be great but terrible in ring skills. His move doesn't look like he could hurt anyone, he doesn't utilize his mic skills anymore, and you can always predict the outcome of his matches. Either he's unbeatable or too beatable like at No Way Out. A good feud is hard to come by and that's why it's taking so long to give a good push to a young superstar.|`|0mg4OBcMaa	1. Completely agree.  They need to have the ability to get over before you throw them in the main event.  You can't just expect it to happen, slack off, and have it handed to you.  A perfect example of this would be Carlito.<br>  <br>  2. There is no reason not to respect the legends.  If it is some mid-card slob and he wasnt respecting a legend in the business, he is totally in the wrong.  However, legends are allowed to not respect other legends.  Like Stone Cold not respecting Hulk Hogan is acceptable, but Jamie Noble not respecting Hulk Hogan is just wrong.<br>  <br>  3. No idea.<br>  <br>  4. True.  People like HBK and Undertaker didnt get a push from a feud with a veteran, they were able to get over by themselves.  Same can be said for Cena.  Cena was able to get over without a feud with a veteran to help it.<br>  <br>  5. True.  Undertakers streak should never end.<br>  <br>  6. Cena deserved it because he was carrying the industry and was the best wrestler in the world at the time.  He was having incredible matches and the Wrestlemania 23 match with HBK was one of the best matches of 2007.  I also dont understand why Cena had to "earn" his victory over HBK.  The man was the WWE Champ at the time.  He earned everything that came to him.  It is okay for Michaels to refuse to job to Hogan as well.  They are both legends and with HBK being active, he is the one that deserves to win.  <br>  <br>  7. You always need to work hard in order to get your push.  You need to have earned it and have gotten over with the crowd|`|J3vufPpTaa	Some of today's legends are irreplaceable, like how you mentioned Shawn & Undertaker. What irritates me is, when the "legends" rarely lose. Take Triple H as the prime suspect, and example. Triple H in the eyes of many, baffling me, is considered a legend. Well, HHH usually buries people, esp. Randy Orton/Backlash '08. I don't base that on my way of respect for veterans, as long-time DESERVING veterans should get respect, regardless, as you explained. I think people are saying that nowadays, because of the many newer generation fans, who like to see new and "improved" superstars.|`|ZDuIhDyDaa	Hey man you seem to know what it takes but WWE have no clue! I mean Cena came from nowhere with some Ruthless Aggression era where he slapped the face of his boss. Then he became a thug and WWE brainwashed fans into thinking he was a legitimate wrestler. Cena aint seena his Weena since he lost it in Vince's Sleena cant wrestle his way out of a wet paper poke and just because kids like him we have to put up with this garbage!<br>  <br>  Taker Edge fued was great and Edge is still Awesome. Will Koslov be the one to defeat Taker?

However, Washington's president Ernie Grunfeld maintains that Gilbert will see a few games before the season ends (why I'm not sure since Washington has about a 0% chance of a postseason). They should just let him continue blogging the rest of the season and return next season. I mean really, why risk it?<br>  <br>  Besides it's going to be a long while before Gilbert returns to form.

I personally thing the Cavs, assuming Delonte and Z are healthy, have the best shot. The Celtics will probably turn it up in the playoffs though, so who knows. Last year they didn't really play hard for a full series until the finals, so don't judge the regular season too much. <br>  <br>  If the Lakers win, Kobe can finally say he won one without Shaq. Thats important for him and his reputation. Kobe is selfish and hungry, and he wants to win a title without another Hall of Famer so people can't give credit to someone else. I would agree with that mindset - his previous titles were bc of Shaq. If they win this one, its because of him.<br>  <br>  Nobody will be too surprised though. They were in the finals last year after all.|`|DIQSP48caa	I think Kobe will finally get some much more well deserved respect as a player because he finally won without Shaq.

Since that day Ive hated him and watching his cocky attitude in interviews doesn't help his case either. He's a complete *ss.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	you have no strong reasons for me to hate Murray. i know sometimes he was a bit arrogant. but he plays beautiful tennis,, he is a very carefull player.<br>  <br>  he is not like Nadal, Del Potro, Tsonga, or Blake who always hit their shot top spin. he prefer to use various shot and his speed is just simply amazing.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	i dont hate him, i respect him as a player and the fact that he has been challenging roger and rafa lately is good to see.<br>  <br>  i just HATE his style of tennis, sorry it is very boring and uninteresting to watch. i just wished that he played more "exciting" tennis.<br>  <br>  but i think he is talented enough to win a grand slam, whether it would be this year or next year.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Yes, I also hate all aspects of Murray.|`|Tja1NM78aa	I don't like him as a person, but as tennis player he is pretty good.<br>  He's not that big in Scotland, but that's because half the population have never watched a tennis match and don't know who the hell andy murray is. I think he's bigger in england than in scotland.<br>  Also, before he got uber famous, he was 'that scottish player' - now he's always 'that british player'. <br>  <br>  Yes, he has an ugly mug and is as boring as anything. <br>  How the hell did he get the gf that he's got? She's really pretty and I see nothing attractive about him, especially after he's won a match - "we don't want to see your biceps, put them away!"|`|NDbx9CSvaa	What's so bad about his tennis? or like several other people on this forum the real reason you hate him is because he defeats your favorite player?<br>  <br>  He's no model so looks should not matter. btw, I'm a very big fan of his. I'm dying to see him win his first GS so that his detractors can shut up. I was disappointed with his loss at the aussie open but after what Verdasco made Nadal go through, there was absolutely no shame in Murray losing to Verdasco. I just hope Verdasco can keep up his good tennis too!|`|ClQ9yJweaa	I dont actually hate him, too strong of a word, but I dont care for him either. Just his total presence irks me and cant stand him. He over reacts, and his game, while quite good, goes over rated. This will sound odd, but he also reminds me of the type that doesnt keep himself clean with his body lol. Cant help it, thats how I feel, think, just has "that way" about him.|`|rFUqIakAaa	But British people generally DO have bad teeth. Tim Henman was a pretty good looking guy I guess but even he had bad teeth. And most British people I see in real life also have bad looking teeth. I don't know why that is.|`|Pz45DaOXaa	too right!!<br>  He also hates English and would prefer to play for Scotland|`|rfboTBTWaa	He's boring.|`|xBp89N7Laa	I DO!!!|`|sptrtwxlaa	lol, OMG I DOO!!!!<br>  he's soo annoying & barbaricly ugly!!
rnH9NnZRaa	I'll do it.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Can't we just have the West Coast offense and the Blitzburgh defense style?|`|RS3fjNboaa	Wow, those suggested categories fit our team well!  <br>   Good question, though. We'll need to check with our OC (Coach Dallas Cowboys Fan Forever) to see what's going on with that. Surely it won't be me. I do my wildcatting off the field. That's in my contract!
FUoKu13Daa	I think it was a bad call but I also think CP3 should have known that with his team up were the Lakers  has to foul he should have passed or try and dribble away to take time off the clock because the lakers had to foul anyway.<br>  <br>  I think he should have been smart enough to know that if he goes up for a layup and get fouls the foul will go one way or the other and why risk it with you team in the driver seat,|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	** sniff , sniff, do you smell that i smell a Hater ,<br>  <br>  They are refs they are not perfect, game is over move on|`|9UhoUcM2aa	I dont think there was a foul on anyone.. <br>  their feet tripped each other on accident... <br>  and Kobe didn't push him, he stuck his arm out...|`|D61u7t1zaa	Shut up dude did you see how Posey was reaching in?|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	They never bail out the Lakers if anything they screw them every time.|`|T8fldPKmaa	I see kobe getting butchered alot in every game and no calls.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Losers always whine, no difference here.|`|3teWTOPqaa	That was a bad call, it happens in NBA games. I am pretty sure the refs made bad calls that favored Cleveland at one time or the other, so what does that say about the Cavs?<br>  <br>  If the Cavs had beaten the Lakers twice this season then you guys would have best record in the NBA, so don't blame the Lakers for winning.<br>  <br>  EDIT: did you know LeBron has never fouled out once in his career? A rare feat even Michael Jordan didn't achieve.
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	TNA just can't seem to please anybody these days.<br>  <br>  When TNA went national WWE fans complained that all they did was wrestle and didn't have "cool" characters, promos, skits, and big stars.  TNA altered their product to give WWE fans what they wanted, including a women's division featuring women who can actually wrestle.  WWE fans complained about "washed-up has-been WWE rejects", "dumb" characters, and storylines that made no sense.  TNA tightened up the storylines, tossed the ones that were going nowhere, created (or altered) some gimmicks to make them more like what WWE fans were accustomed to.  Still the WWE fans complain and want the "Attitude Era " back.<br>  <br>  TNA is now presenting the same programming we got from the WWF during the "Attitude Era".  Endless promos and skits, gimmick matches, and very little else.<br>  <br>  And still the WWE fans complain...<br>  <br>  I prefer TNA over the WWE.  TNA has better athletes, more skilled wrestlers, performing generally better wrestling matches than the WWE.  The TNA wrestlers have generally more realistic and believable gimmicks than those in the WWE.  The storylines in both companies are crap but I find the MEM - Frontline angle MUCH more interesting than that Edge - Vickie nonsense or that cartoon supervillain called The Viper they shovel down our throats on both RAW AND Smackdown.<br>  <br>  TNA would be much better off forgetting about the prejudicial snobbish WWE fans who will never like anything any other wrestling company does and just go back to what got them on the map in the first place: the best wrestling matches in North America.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	lmao..I noticed that M's thing too. That empty arena match has been done before, I didn't see it to be a big deal. I had the choice to watch it, but decided not to. I watched Petey's last match and crossed my fingers he's coming to WWE. Alex Shelley is the only person I watch on that show. I haven't even been tuning in to see him lately. I get bored during TNA. Me being bored during a wrestling show...that just doesn't happen. I remember, I watched an episode right after it was announced Christian was released, just to see how the show has been doing. It was FULL of promos. After all the hype I kept hearing...well I was VERY disappointed. I'm glad both Jeff and Christian aren't there anymore. Now I don't have to bother watching it.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	TNA just doesnt do it for me<br>  <br>  honestly i recorded it from last week and i was watching it an hour ago and i fell asleep, truly honest, i have never been able to finish a TNA show|`|YTLlMdhDaa	I watch TNA as an alternative to WWE sometimes, because WWE can also get boring. I also, only watch the X-division guys. I like MCMGs and Lethal/Consequences. Their match last week was very good.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Who's Writing this Crap!? - Vince Russo , THAT'S Who!<br>  There's Your Problem...<br>  <br>  <br>  TNA = Straight Trash.<br>  I Only Watch Because There is NOTHING Else on On Thursdays.<br>  Son of a.....|`|awNQ0h2gaa	TNA knows how to make the best out of all superstars, they should swap around the TNA writers with the WWE writers, then the WWE would improve.|`|sQpoIxf7aa	tna suck i would rather watch the grass grow or the paint dry|`|dPi7zMxWaa	yes i do and they do need a new writer.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	It is WCW during the days when employees used to joke that they have jobs only because of Ted cutting the checks and not really caring about the product. No matter the tours in Europe - which are guaranteed to lose money - the company is in trouble (Gail Kim leaves because she is offered a contract in five figures, not a good sign) and I give it until mid-summer....at that point TNA will be out of business.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	LOL M's! Wow I like TNA even thought they make mistakes i've said before that many companies mess up  it will take some time for them to find their niche, they are probably messin up by tryin to reach WWE only fans, obviously that isn't working. They show go back to focusing on their X division that's what made them big int he first place right?  <br>  <br>  And on the young talent as well and freshen up the mainevent's huh? Not everyone wants to see Kurt Angle vs Sting again...or Angle vs AJ. No offence to Angle fans, but get more young wrestler's in mainevents for once. And they should make AJ Mr TNA again he can still go and was another reason why poeple started wacthing him, let's see him in more macthes. <br>  <br>  And can TNA please put alittle less focus on Angle see him all the time now! No offence again, but it's annoying|`|NXktxy8jaa	Im not a fan of TNA, and I surely do not like their current gimmicks and Storylines, but you have to give them some credit.<br>  <br>  TNA has a lot of Promos during their shows, and I can Honestly say that they have mastered that. But the one thing I really get bored about are the Backstage Interviews and Segments that they do. The Interviews are just Boring and they occur every 5 minutes. They Also Have these new Segments that are shown as well such as Abyss at Therapy. We Know That his Therapist is Stevie Richards- Its Obvious. And this other Segment with Mick Foley, what is up with that? He says that he reflects on his life and his Greatest matches during his segment, but how can he if it only lasts 2 minutes? And ODB's Angle is just stupid. There is no point to it and it Rarely comes on. TNA needs to work on these things and it will improve in the future.<br>  <br>  One more thing are the Storylines. The Main Event Mafia Storyline has gone too far, and it should have ended months ago. Everyone was expecting a final "Clash" between The Frontlines and The MEM but that storyline was just dropped. Now its between the Main Event Mafia members and it is again a Dull Storyline. Everyone is waiting for the MEM Storyline to finally end.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	im not a big fan off tna but i still watch it  sure the story line ain't that great and  and most wrestlers from tna is former wwe stars they just need to fire vince russ and put paul hey-man on and grab some decent writers but nothing wrong with the wrestling|`|tl1HTJRwaa	If they finally come up with original storylines they'll be fine<br>  <br>  They have alot more talent then the wwe so yes i like tham but they need to learn how to use it|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I dont like TNA at all. Bad production. Misuse of talent. Bad storylines. Bad announcing all wrapped in one.

f1UYyl3Qaa	yea you can, but dont.<br>  <br>  Just learn it the right way, this will help you a lot more. That 2 feet will give the opponent more time, will slow down your serve, and make you develop a bad habit. <br>  <br>  Just practice your serve, getting it in, you get a way better angle right near the line than 2 feet back.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	u can, but try to serve closer to the baseline.|`|RjQLB9s1aa	Mate, you can stand 20 feet back if you wish. As long as you are behind the line, that's all that matters.|`|svzPMz2Maa	Yeah, you can serve anywhere behind the baseline!! I personally prefer standing about a foot a way from the baseline.

I dont see why you would want to though...|`|91b7280fd9803a425ab46749a96ff39aaa	I don't think you serve so far coz you'd be standing too close... <br>  It happens to me too sometimes and my coach always tells me it's because I start moving my right hand (the one I'm serving with) too late, so I don't get it straight and  don't finish the move with my wrist...<br>  But that's just me...<br>  I think you can stand further back from the baseline coz the rules say you have to stand behind the baseline and nothing else (or at least I think so...)|`|jeXc6UV8aa	Im pretty sure its fine.  As long as you are behind the baseline they dont care.<br>  Although, there are other things you can do so that your serve doesnt go long.  Try throwing the ball up higher, and make sure you follow through with your whole arm. Also, hit it ball right in the center of your raquet.<br>  On your first serve i encourage you to go for power, but on your second serve take it easy and just serve the ball so that you can play the point.

ZzYy2szvaa	La Nina is basically an "emphasised" version of the usual weather pattern called Walker Circulation.  The Trade Winds blow much stronger (from South America towards Indonesia) and the water becomes very warm.  Upwelling of the ocean floor at South America is more than usual and the conditions in South America are much drier, and Indonesia becomes a lot colder and wetter.<br>  <br>  I can't remember the effect it has on USA, but I think the temperature increases slightly and the magnitude of tornadoes are slighlty lessened, but other than that, I can't remember.  I have no clue whether the world is experiencing a La Nina or not - maybe check a good weather site and see recent or major events.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Here is a link that describes it somewhat: <a href="http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/enso/ensofaq.html#3" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/enso/ensofaq.htm...</a><br>  and a basic diagram: <a href="http://www.eoearth.org/upload/thumb/0/07/La_nina_diagram.gif/300px-La_nina_diagram.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.eoearth.org/upload/thumb/0/07...</a>|`|KkkugCJ0aa	yeah i hear ya, i havent been able to surf newport at all cause its FLLat..honestly the best place has been south side of the hb pier, theres usually a little somein somein over there when everything else is flat..|`|CyWEam38aa	Ya it suck balls right now <br>  but santa barbara is decent right now
4Wog48CAaa	This is useful in finding surf spots because the ocean floor does indeed play a large role in the quality of waves.  The ocean bottom topograpy, swell direction, water depth (bathymetry), and tide can be used to predict whether waves will break well.  I have no idea who created google ocean.  sorry|`|FslOs6pnaa	I saw a video of google ocean the other day<br>  <br>  go on youtube, type google ocean, and you'll be able to watch that video and know a little more about it  :P

They can also refract swell causing it to change direction.

AA10270018	You have to try both of them to make sure because we don't really see your hand to tell you for sure. Most tennis stores will let you borrow the racquet to hit with before you have to buy them.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Buy them both, and make sure you keep the receipts. Then practice with both and see which one is most comfortable for you to use.<br>  Once you've decided, get a refund on the other one you brought.<br>  <br>  Good luck ?|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	Im sure your local shop has a demo program, or if you're buying online they most definitely have a demo program. Most likely the kind of racket you need is a mid price range racket with a large head size. The price shouldn't go over $150 and the racket head size should be at least 110 square inches. You're in a good position to find a very good racket for a cheaper price because oversized rackets are usually much cheaper than player or tweener rackets (which are usually for higher level players). You need the oversized racket because it produces much more power, and a larger sweet spot for a better chance of a good hit. Find several rackets with different head sizes (make sure they're oversized) and different grip sizes. You should be able to take at least 2 home or if you order i think its up to 4. Try them out for about a few days to a week, and buy the one you felt most comfortable with.|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	Judging from your height, I think you will need the 4 1/4 grip size (sometimes is called "L2" grip). I'm 5'3" and I use that one. You can easily increase the circumference of the grip, but it's hard to reduce the size. You can determine whether a grip is too big or too small for your hand. Grip the racket, and try to put your index finger of your non-dominant hand. If it fits, then the grip fits you.<br>  <br>  PS. Use overgrips to increase the size.|`|GTZFpbfPaa	well, what you need is an adult size. seeing as you are moving into a new tennis career and are only 14 you should grow into the larger size with time. also you will save money because then you wont need to purchase a new racket once youve grown out of the smaller size.|`|AA11821715	get both, try them out, keep the receipt, and keep the one you like best         :D|`|dEcIR7pZaa	Yes, there is a method. Put your hand around the grip and you will see a space where the finger and palm will meet again, place the index finger of your other hand vertically in that space. If the finger fits perfectly then the grip size is perfect. If there is too little or too much space try changing the size. Also, you might want to choose a size smaller as you can put an overgrip. That's what I did. I used a 4 3/8 before and now I've changed to 4 1/4 with an overgrip and it's perfectly fine. <br>  <br>  Buy adult size. I've seen 10-year old kids play with an adult-sized racket.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have little power in your shots you might want to get a head-heavy racket(ask the guy at the counter how to find  out if it is head-heavy or head-light, it's a little hard to explain) which will generate more power for you. If you hit really hard and like to go up to the net for volleys you might want a head-light racket as it gives you better control. If you start with head-heavy, you might want to progress slowly to a balanced racket. <br>  <br>  If you can't generate enough power you might want to go for strings with less tension.<br>  <br>  I've been playing tennis for more than 10 years now and I started with a head-heavy racket that was really light. Now I'm using a 300g Babolat Aeropro Drive Cortex.|`|91b7280fd9803a425ab46749a96ff39aaa	Here's a link to these sizes of grips:<br>  <a href="http://tenis.sport-zabava.cz/images/meridlo-gripu.gif" rel="nofollow">http://tenis.sport-zabava.cz/images/meri...</a><br>  <a href="http://tenis.babolat.sweb.cz/images/velikost-gripu-drzadla-tenisove-rakety.gif" rel="nofollow">http://tenis.babolat.sweb.cz/images/veli...</a><br>  (just ignore the text, it's in Czech...)<br>  There are 5 different grips: G1: 4 1/8 (10,5cm), G2: 4 1/4 (10,8cm), G3: 4 3/8 (11,1cm), G4: 4 1/2 (11,4cm), G5: 4 5/8 (11,7cm)<br>  G1 and G2 are mainly for women, G3 is for both men and women and G4 and G5 are mainly for men...|`|jeXc6UV8aa	Yes, there is a method that you should use.  When you take a raquet, grip your hand around it as if you are about to play.  Then, take the index finger of the opposite hand and see if it fits in between your fingers and your thumb.  If you can do this, then its the right size for you<br>  <br>  I would reccommend picking up a 4 1/4 first.  I started playing tennis at your age, all the same features and thats the size i got.<br>  <br>  When you are in the store, if you are still not sure which one to get, ask someone to help you.  that's what they salesmen are there for, they should know what they are talking about =]|`|mVUpt8waaa	Get a 4 1/4 grip for your size.

U3ZBUOWaaa	You aren't bashing but yet put (WHO?) in your question?? I said I wasn't going to answer anymore hating questions but I will this one.  Elliot Sadler is a decent hard driving former winner who ALMOST won last weekend...he's had some hard luck in past season like all those blown tires.  But watch him win a few this season. he will get a win before Almendinger.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	because sadler cried and got lawyers involved... it's quite a shame his lawyers can't drive for him either, they most certainly couldn't do any worse... Someone outta show him a diagram and let him know where the gas pedal is.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	Because the owner gets to sign whomever he wants to drive the car. It is his car. To drive one of these machines you have to earn it. The good thing is there are a lot of different owners and you only have to impress one to get a ride. I guess Elliot Sadler impressed at least one owner and A.J. impressed no one or somebody would have given him a chance. Fair has little to do with it.... but then again it is pretty fair because you have a lot of different owners looking at you and if you're any good you're bound to get a job with somebody.|`|n55igpCUaa	It was not Elliot's fault AJ is outside the top 35.

And a lot has to do with marketing and AJ is a nice guy with a bright future but does a business invest in a new face in the state of this economy or do they go with a proven and established star with a fan base? I hope you consider these valid points -i do.|`|d5KySuEFaa	This will be Elliot's last year only because it says so on paper.  He's a proven non-winner and leading Daytona where restrictor plate racing can result in anyone leading a lap or two at some point is nothing special.  He whines more than he wins and his time is done unless it rains with him leading sometime in 2009.  If you were a car owner would you rather hire someone who is showing some signs of talent like AJ or someone who has spent a decade without a win?|`|4l0yGuE9aa	1 more year was left on his contract|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Elliot has experience.<br>  <br>  AJ doesn't have much.

Edge was the one who stole the MITB Briefcase from Kennedy back in 2007,if i wasn't for Edge,Kennedy would've won the WWE Championship,he worked hard just to get that Briefcase,but Edge just stole his shot! so,i do want to see Kennedy as the WWE Champion and by the time he gets it,i hope he'll have a Long Title reign because he really deserves it.|`|EmUqxoN2aa	1.

3teWTOPqaa	LeBron's 55, that was a hell of a game from Bron Bron, he was lighting them up from downtown. Honestly I don't think there will be a debate over this, LeBron's 55 performance was way better, he shot the ball great from the field and his team busted the game open in the 4th quarter behind his strong play. Lakers let a 13pts lead slip away, even though Kobe was clutch in OT, but he missed a ton of shots in the 1st 3 quarters. This is coming from a Lakers fan.<br>  <br>  <br>  FYI, Kobe is still the best player in the league!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm actually going to go with LeBron.  Its close because Kobe played a better team and was better in the clutch, but overall LeBrons scoring was better. <br>  <br>  LeBron's 55 was a better scoring night, especially when you consider Kobe played 5 more minutes and those 5 minutes got him 11 more points.  If you take the regular game, without Kobe's extra 5 minutes, youre talking 55 vs 28, and LeBron essentially doubled Kobe.  Kobe was better when the game was on the line, but when you take into consideration scoring, 55-5-9 is a better statline than 39-5-5.  Also, Kobe took more shots, and LeBron, who's not known for his range, was an impressive 8-11 from 3.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	I gotta go with Kobe, because they are still playing without Bynum. Remember last time Lakers lost at home when Bynum was still healthy.I think Bynum's absence affects more to the team than Delote's west's to theirs. Because Bynum was playing well in both offensively and defensively. That was why they lost last season's finals. I think both just did what they needed to do to help their team. But Lakers are playing tougher, since they los Bynum, they snapped Boston's 12 winnng streak and Cavs' 23 straight home wins. Kobe could have scored 50+ tonight too, but he was well defended, thats it.|`|HLzS2z9laa	just to let you know that Lebron can get pretty hot, CP3 got too greedy wit it, NO had the game won, hope chris learns form this, When Fisher hit that 3 in the 4th, I knew Lakers got it from then on, good game from Butler too<br>  <br>  But yeah Lebron lightin up the Bucks form half court was pretty amazing, Kobe wasnt doin much on Posey|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Kobe could and we did have a harder game but Bucks dont have Redd he is injured. So I go with Kobe|`|urqGJPwpaa	Lol, as a Laker fan, I should choose Kobe.  But I'm not biased, and I know who had a better performance.  I'm going with Lebron tonight.  Lebron went 16-29, while Kobe went while kobe went 13-30.  Lebron had 5 assists and 9 boards, while Kobe had 5 assists and 5 boards with an extra 5 minutes too.  Although Kobe played the better team, his performance wasn't as good as Lebrons.|`|tLLWMy7iaa	LeBron no doubt. If you look at the stats, LeBron's game was way better. He scored 16 more points and took less shots. <br>  <br>  LOL Duke O. Kobe's 81 was not Kobe getting hot, he missed 18 shots! It was his taking more shots than the rest of his team combined and not passing. LeBron does other things than just score.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Kobe for me too! =), I mean the game was AWESOME. His clutch lay up + the foul in OT was GREAT. The Hornets are a good team.. <br>  <br>  What LeBron did was awesome too..but they were playing the Bucks..ya know.<br>  <br>  <br>  wooo hoo.. thank you Fisherrrrrrr for the 3 to go into OT. =)|`|nBqZBbtnaa	Kobe 100%<br>  <br>  Like you said, he did it against a helluva lot better team. Lebron will never shoot like that again. He was launching prayers and they kept going in, when you play 1000s of games you're bound to have a hot one.<br>  <br>  Hot Lebron=high 50s<br>  Hot Kobe=81|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Kobe because he played against a good team with the best point guard. And LeBron just player a mediocre team.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	lebron all the way. lakers should of lost tonight. huge gift from the refs|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Is this your real writing?

Nickster was always a Laker fan :D<br>  <br>  It's late right now, but it's usually around this time that Laker fans are online. Other teams have their fair share of fans, but I would definitely say that Laker fans are the majority aka we own. Just playing... No I'm not.|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Despite Boston having the most NBA Championships, LA Lakers are arguably the best franchise in NBA history. Sure, Boston has more rings, but they haven't been a legit contender throughout every season, excluding the past 2. The Lakers have been a legit contender for the title almost every season, having a very long streak of decent seasons, not many teams can say that. Most teams have a run at a few, Pistons, Spurs, the rest, but all eventually fade out, LA seems to be a top contender each and every year, regardless if they win a ring or not.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the fact that all the celebrities are from LA and show up to the games, they sell out each game, and they come froma  very large and widely known area in that of Los Angeles, where dreams are made. So yes, they have a large following, especially when you have assets like Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson on your side and the greatest player to be playing today in Kobe Bryant, not to mention the fact they are usually at the top of they're conference in wins and at the top of they're conference in the entire NBA standings.<br>  <br>  The Lakers will always be a tough team to beat and a tough team for many fans to give up on. LA isn;t like Cleveland, where they suddenly and mysteriously came out of the shadows and started wearing Cleveland jerseys, because of whom, oh yeah... Lebron James. Once Lebron is gone, the fans are gone. Once the trio in Boston is gone, the fans are gone. Look what happened to the Detroit Pistons after they're championship win, they went on another season or so and everyone gave up on them and focused they;re attention to the new, better teams.<br>  <br>  Most fans are bandwagon fans. LA has the most true fans, the fans that have been long-term, not short-term. Many will say that people started liking them when Kobe arrived, but this is not true, before there was Kobe there was someone else and before that someone else, was someone else...|`|Nuj1eScCaa	I think there are a majority of Laker fans on here, especially around this time. It's after 4 here right now but it's only a little after 1 there so there's bound to be more West coast fans on now.<br>  <br>  There's more Lakers fans than any other fans, but that's not a bad thing.

They are essentially straight punches, and can be delivered non-telegraphically from a neutral position.

The arc-hand strike will likely kill them, literally, but if not, they can't breathe for a few seconds. If you knee the floating ribs, they can fracture inwards and puncture the vital organs, and then the kick to the thigh will blow their knee out. In short, they are in one heck of a mess.

LpR9sLSlaa	They figured that was the MAXIMUM # of cars they could cram onto the smaller tracks and pit stalls.<br>  <br>  and for the sake of continuity<br>  that became the limit for all tracks.<br>  <br>  "In the past field size was based on the size of the tracks. At one time there was over 50 drivers running at tracks like Daytona and as little as 28 running at tracks like Hickory. However, when the modern era came about and the Money got better with Winston as the series sponsor NASCAR and the drivers settled on 42 drivers for the field, as most tracks would accomodiate that many pit stalls. <br>  <br>  Again, keep in mind NASCAR used to have up to 60 cars trying to make the field and if you could get in then you could make money.<br>  <br>  In 1989, the King Richard Petty, failed to qualify for a Race, So 3 time Champion Darrell Waltrip, who has been know to shoot his mouth off, told a national audience that it was a shame someone with the Kings status should miss a race. So Darrell proposed a "Past Champions" provisional that would allow any previous champion to be placed in the 43rd starting spot. <br>  Well in 1998, I believe, NASCAR decided to make the 43rd spot perminate. So if a past champions provisional was not used then the 43rd spot would be fielded by the next highest qualifier."|`|JSryPP8faa	I have to agree with Bolt on this one, cause he's in 3D.|`|n55igpCUaa	Because 53 is too many and 33 is too few?<br>  <br>  <-- Look.

kisgowXcaa	Ping pong is an Olympic sport as it should be.  It requires the same amount of skill and concentration as, if not more than, other sports.  It actually demands quite a bit of physical strength and flexibility.  Power is needed to make those nonreturnable smashes and anyone who has played real table tennis knows that you have to be able to dive to any side of the table in order to save a well-placed slice or hook.  Heck, sometimes, you even have to hit the ball completely backwards.  In addition, this game requires strategic minds and QUICK thinking.  Not only do you have to decide how you want to spin the ball, how hard you want to hit it, and and where you want to place it, but you have to make these decisions in split second intervals while the ball is hurtling towards your side, often at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour!!!  Believe me, the game may not look challenging but it's tougher than most know.|`|a9U0aH54aa	Yes it should<br>  <br>  it is so quick and strong.

3tSMTwGraa	Yes, it call dim mak.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	Forget paralyzing someones arm, you may as well armbar them and break the damn arm in two pieces|`|AA12388139	There are a number of points on the arm (as on all the limbs) that will paralyse, though the effect will not last and a proper counter must be made in the time that the mind of your opponent has been taken over or disturbed. Outside of the 'funny bone' point, the obvious ones are one near the wrist, one on forearm, two on upper arm; others are mostly a minor effect. Some must be struck by, for instance a hard knuckle, some by continuous penetrating pressure.  It is not practical to try to take advantage of these points when the attacking arm is moving, such as when it is striking.  Maximum effect arises when the arm is, for instance, anchored on you as in a grab.  This provides resistance to your pressure.  Note that the angle of attack is crucial and that most people's physical nerve pattern in the body varies from individual to individual and this variability of target problem can be easily overcome by the use of a certain method.  Ju Jutsu is one of the arts that specializes in such matters. Try taking up a martial arts course, and, if the teacher or master is knowledgeable, and if you are a suitable person of honour, then they might teach you the finer points of the art of Points or body switches.  Like all methods and techniques there are cases where they are devastating and cases where they are ineffective. Good training and a keen heart body and mind will make you a better fighter of evil and so a better fighter for peace.  There is no peace of body or of mind without organised and knowledgeable actions.|`|AA10976536	Temporarily, yes - it's actually pretty common, and you've probably done it to yourself on accident: it's called "hitting your funny bone". (No, I'm not being sarcastic - it really is considered a martial arts pressure point.) <br>  <br>  What you're actually doing is hitting a nerve cluster called the ulnar nerve that runs along the elbow. When you smack your elbow, it rams that nerve into the humerus bone (ie, the bone that connects your shoulder to your elbow), which sends a massive amount of 'noise' up the nerve and into  your brain. If you hit it lightly, it just makes your hand feel tingly. but if you hit it hard enough, your arm goes numb and you can't feel anything for a minute or so.<br>  <br>  That same nerve cluster also runs over onto the inside of your arm, just under your bicep. (to find it in there, take a knuckle and gently poke around on the inside of your bicep - you should be able to send slight tingles up your arm. I don't recommend doing this much though, as I don't know the long-term consequences of mushing your nerves around with your knuckles.) <br>  <br>  The strength in your arm is more than enough to hit someone else's funny bone and set it off, temporarily parylizing that limb. However, it's pretty hard to aim at that small a location in a fight, and it's obvious when you do it that you're hitting the person. The one on the bicep can sometimes be hit with a rear hammer strike if you manage to get an outside parry with your lead hand, though - I learned that one in Escrima/Arnis, and I've had it done to me...once, I think. So I know it works at least in sparring.<br>  <br>  That being said - it's not very sexy or cool or a secret of ninja masters or anything. Most pressure points are either pretty obvious (soft tissue strikes - eyes or throat or groin) or else like that bicep nerve strike, that is usually more trouble than it's worth: yeah,  you can hit someone with it, but if you're good enough to do that you don't NEED to hit them with it; you can just hit them normally.|`|mlTF11Pwaa	you could easily do this hell you could paralyze a whole persons body with just your bare hands.

GLBywBHZaa	Im not sure exactly what you are looking for, but I am a triple jumper in track so I can give you my best advice lol<br>  <br>  -get a good pair of spikes..if not, then just wear and light running shoes<br>  -go at full speed and NEVER look down at the board (look straight)..that's why its important to stay at consistent speed and have your marks beore the event starts<br>  -don't go high on your 1st  step..always go all out on your last step (just before you land in the pit)<br>  -when landing in the pit..keep your knees high so you stay in the air longer and cover more distance..<br>  <br>  that's all I can think of right now lol<br>  hope I helped you :)
G33E41IBaa	I'm sorry...I've literally looked at 10 different websites, no joke.  I can't find one, and I couldn't find a website that provided customized t-shirts.  They've only got the big name players like Marleau, Thornton, and Nabokov.  I think your only option would be to either get another player's name on the t-shirt, a plain Sharks logo shirt, or a Michalek jersey.<br>  <br>  If you live near the Shark Tank, you can try the Sharks Arena Store, which I know has a much bigger selection than online.  Contact them first to make sure they have Michalek t-shirts, and if they do you can ask them to hold it for you.<br>  <a href="http://sharks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=sto_Home" rel="nofollow">http://sharks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=...</a><br>  <br>  Also, I know near where I live, there's a sports store that customizes apparel.  You could research stores around where you live to see if any of them do customization, and you can bring in a blank Sharks shirt and see what they can do.<br>  <br>  Sorry.

NJMzhcKhaa	Frank Shamrock submission is good, but he was at the peak in a sport when good submission artists were rare.<br>  He was the top of food chain back then, but for the modern day fighters, he's not top there anymore. Not when you compare him against submission artists like Demian Maia or Palhares.<br>  <br>  Here's the problem with the fighters from earlier time, they were the top back then and in their gym, they are the top one too.<br>  Great example was Shonnie Carter in TUF season 4, when he puked on the training, and then he said something that in his place, he is the top dog, being around pro-fighters in the TUF made him realize how inadequate his training was.<br>  The same with the Shamrocks, they're incapable of seeing how the sport MMA has gone further than what they achieved back then, and without them inviting the new breed of top fighters into their training place, they don't have anyone else to compare themselves to and they become the victim of their ego and past accomplishment.<br>  <br>  That's why the level of their gym in Lions Den does not keep up either. When is the last time you've seen a champ out of Lions den?<br>  The only decent  fighter they have is Roy Nelson, and he got owned badly by Andrei Arlovski.<br>  It doesn't keep up with their past accomplishment.|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Hes well past his prime, he doesnt have the quickness to transition into submissions very well anymore.  For that fact yes.|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	Frank is still a good fighter. I would love to see him fight Tito again. All these years later.

zN82yuVDaa	tell him to get a life, stop thinking that his son is the best b-ball player in the world, bcuz he's sh!t, and tell him if you want to coach, coach somewhere where they require losers|`|ea68d20a9f8a2f1b110b43fe61244a44aa	Some Alternatives for you:<br>  1. Play better than the other guys, especially in practice and don't badmouth the coach or his son.<br>  2. Make friends with the coach's son so he will say good things about<br>  you at the dinner table<br>  3. Ask the coach what things you need to work on to make you an important member of the team<br>  4. Listen closely to the coach in practice to see what he is most impressed by and work on those things<br>  5. Keep your distance from the other 2 players that don't play...maybe they are doing or saying things that keep you from doing your best.<br>  6. Don't quit|`|OHVCytOwaa	You didn't bother stating your win-loss ratio. How can we say that your coach is bad? You guys are probably winning a lot of close games that's why he's not playing you and two others.<br>  It's either you put up or shut up! He is the coach and he can play whoever he wants! You probably need a lot of work and he probably feels sorry for the three of you that's why you're with the team. <br>  Are you wearing a jersey during games or just pants and shirt with the words water boy across your chest and back. <br>  Seriously, you must improve your game, practice.... practice a lot, be the first one on the court and the last one to leave, That's the only way you can improve your game. STOP COMPLAINING! That's what looser and BENCH WARMERS do!|`|6FsZykp1aa	wow.. im in 8th grade and we have multiple plays,<br>  i play on the boys and girls teams, so i have to know all the plays for all the positions.<br>  <br>  what your playing is called a Three Two, its usually used as a Defense against a Zone Offense|`|LCV8Aky2aa	It does sound like ur coach isnt the greatest although the whole coach son thing is very familiar but if the son sucks then thats just selfish by the coach. Yet he is a coach so he probobly knows a bit more about basketball than u.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, unfortunately there's not a whole lot you can do about who coaches your team.  I don't know what level you're playing at, but there's always someone else making those decisions.<br>  <br>  How did your team do?  I mean a 3 guard 2 forward lineup isn't always bad, it has the advantage of more shooting and usually better speed and a more uptempo offense, especially if you're not fortunate enough to have a good center.  I know that you may dislike a coach that doesn't play you, but if the team is winning the coach may be just playing the people he needs to win.  <br>  <br>  Its really hard to tell what's going on based on the info you gave us.  I mean its possible that the coach is playing his son the most because its his son and sitting you and the other 2 out for no reason, but its also possible that you and the other 2 who don't play aren't very good and therefore get no PT.  If the team is winning and playing well, then its most likely just sour grapes, if youre consistantly losing, then maybe the team does need a better coach.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	There's no bad coaches, just players that refuses to listen to the elderly.|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	No offense, but I'm going to tell you how it is. Coaches play the players that bring int he numbers. Whether it be off rebounds, assists, points, blocks, or steals. Apparently your not doing a good enough job to stick in his mind for game-day. I'm sure if you were hustling to the fullest in each practice, and were out-playing the other 5 starters, you would be a starter yourself. Coaches don't play people who aren't good, in some cases, they do, in this case it happens to be his son, otherwise the other 4 earned they're spot. You need to earn yours, your not good enough in his eyes, you need to stand out and make an impression next season if you want minutes.<br>  <br>  I doubt he is benching you because your good. Is he? Even you must know that the other 4 or 5 out there are better then you. You need to talk to your coach and ask him what it is you can better yourself in to get minutes. He will talk back, trust me, he will explain to you, "You know, your not getting down the court quick enough to keep up with the pace of the game... your jump-shot isn't being executed well, while other players are doing better..." he will give you an explanation. I know this because the reason he's not playing you is because he has a reason! Meaning if you ask him that reason he will tell you, he won't just say... "I don't know, it never crossed my mind to put you in, you are good, I didn't think about it." No! He has notes, he knows which players are struggling and in what areas they are struggling in.<br>  <br>  Show him you deserve to be played and he will play you, trust me.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	The 3 guard offense is commonly used at the college level. It allows for better fast break opportunities and better shooters to be out on the field more. Also, the guards can drive to the basket and draw more fouls.<br>  <br>  As for the playing time, take it to him. If he doesn't pay any attention, tell you parents and have them take it to the school. I am sure there is a reason he doesn't play you guys often enough. Maybe you're too big for his scheme.|`|zJAVYQWiaa	Sounds like my friends coach.<br>  i was versing him (were are separate teams in a comp) and the coach had a son who is crap at shooting, Guarding, dribbling and HE DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL but still his dad MADE him play and it made it easier for us to win.<br>  <br>  My coach did 3 guards and 2 forwards aswell it works out if you use it correctly.<br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing Change teams if he is still going to coach or Show him what you can do.<br>  Best of Luck (Y)|`|3zGTnghRaa	u sure the coach is bad? or u prolly jus needa step ur game up
2Ot2F73Uaa	Depends, off spin is easier to bowl then both pace nd leg spin. Then I feel pace bowling is the second most difficult to bowl.

2Gz6pVbKaa	The short answer is yes, for every 10 young fast bowlers there is only 1 or 2 good spinners so if you can get good you should find it easier to advance through the grades.

2umKyYEaaa	I'm a swimmer. A while ago, I stopped swimming for about a year. When I started swimming again, I had cramps all the time, my chest hurt and my muscles ached. <br>  Swimming makes your heart work and therefore, you need to breathe a lot. After I jog, I usually push myself and have chest pains and trouble breathing, but it always passes in less than a day or two.<br>  However, if you drank any of the water, you might have gotten a pulmonary infection. As a lifeguard, I would've recommended you to see a doctor within 48 of swimming just to be sure.<br>  Talk about it with your P.E. teacher or you school nurse to get more info.<br>  As for the neck, it could be serious and you shouldn't ignore it if the pain lasts.|`|sIDQlZ4Xaa	i rekon that ur not use to it really  and if u fell sore when u where smiwwing did u try really really hardd ?|`|llgBLR6daa	i'm a swimmer and often it is easy to pull a muscle while doing a stroke. its not bad- your body is just adjusting to it like it has to with any other sport. (especially if you haven't done it in a while) i'm also not a great diver and my chest sometimes hurts after if i didnt do it properly. i wouldn't worry about it too much. you should feel better soon. thats a great work out good for you|`|NFvZDiNSaa	you probably tried too hard. or you might of done a dodgy dive (sorry) ya know maybe a belly flop?! or it could be that you haven't swam in ages. don't worry it happens to everyone! :D xxx

And if you want to learn karate for self-defense, the dojo's style (kyokushin) is pretty rough--better be prepared to get some bruises as you get more experienced lol (hey, safer to learn how to take a hit in the dojo than on the street, right? lol)<br>  <br>  And if you don't like that dojo...well, there's alot of Kajukenbo places in San Jose|`|M2gOhRpEaa	<a href="http://findingyouranswer.dalnet.ca" rel="nofollow">http://findingyouranswer.dalnet.ca</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|8Zjw8bsxaa	good for you mate, you didnt specify where you are in the world, but no matter GKR Karate is international you could possibly find a training location near you by going to:<br>  <br>  www.gkrkarate.com<br>  <br>  i know im probably going to get marked down for that, since for some reason ppl seem to hate GKR or Karate in general, but mate, the classes are fun and friendly to attend, and they do teach you some good self defence and you have fun and meet new ppl while doing it.

mlTF11Pwaa	this depends if you want to improve just one stroke because this is the number of races you've entered then you keep practicing the stroke you need to perfect.<br>  <br>  If it;s more than one you need to divide your time into practicing each and every one.<br>  <br>  For front crawl a quicker way to do it is to do less breaths of air and more reps like if you normally do 2 reps than breathe instead do 3 or 4 but do not deprive yourself of oxygen. Your arms matter more in front crawl so put more power into pulling yourself through the water but still kick hard.<br>  <br>  For breathe stroke the same applies arms are more important than legs so put less power into your legs and more into your arms but stil put power into your legs. And again do more reps inbeeen breathing.<br>  <br>  For backcrawl you just need to practice and get yourself familiar with it. (for mor ehelp read about front and breathe strokes)<br>  <br>  Don't do butterfly if your not experienced! it takes a long time to perfect it. and it equires the most energy so don't wast yout time with it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, don't doubt your own ability|`|UULgRsDSaa	if you already know how to do freestyle and breaststroke all you need to do is just keep working hard on those and your arms and kick will get stronger<br>  <br>  butterfly: in the water just move your hips back and forth.  Then start adding your double arms to it.  Watch a youtube video to figure out the timing<br>  <br>  backstroke: Make sure that your pulls on both sides are equal, otherwise you will run into a lane line.   Remember to turn your body side to side.  Watch youtube for that one too|`|hw5SiulRaa	okay well first off i would start going to the pool in your extra time.... and i would also start doing crunches and stuff. i would also try to find someone on your school swim team and ask for help. For freestyle to go faster make your stroke longer and have a deep pull. backstroke is like free style only on your back. and i cant really help you with breaststroke and butterfly because i don't swim those at all.|`|DXV0A1haaa	Can't help much without being able to critique your performance.. but practice really is the best way to keep getting better.  Good thing about swimming, when you get something right, you'll feel the difference pretty quickly (less fatiguing, muscles stress differently)..  Learning an efficient flutter kick makes a HUGE difference in freestyle, especially if you don't have much reach or upper body strength.  A good flutter kick for your size and shape will help you get arms and shoulders in rythm, and help keep your center of mass in line with your stroke.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a strong kick (though that's great) it's also about using the weight and strength of legs and hips to keep your body pointed properly through the arm stroke, to produce the lowest drag profile in the water.  <br>  <br>  Also, being female, your anatomy and choice of suit makes a big difference.  If you have erm.. the anatomy to cause drag, selecting a snug fitting suit that sits HIGH up your torso (to keep it from catching water when you are rotating through the stroke, and to keep tissue mass as flat as possible) will help a lot too.|`|EBW1dk4Zaa	you can't do much in 2 days about your speed as that takes weeks of training day in day out other than buy a good, drag reducing swimming suit such as a speedo aquablade which will make you glide through the water easier. In the long term, I think you should try and swim a bit more, maybe 5 or 6 times a week? If you don't swim for a proper team, then join your local swimming club as they have qualified coaches that will help you with your strokes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Backstroke is really simple. It's practically front crawl on your back but you need to keep your arms straight. Keep your bottom and stomach pushed up so you float on the water and kick your legs in a steady rhythm. As for the arms, rotate your shoulders as you swim and also keep your head still.<br>  <br>  Butterfly is a lot harder to explain. Here is a link and it gives really good step by step instructions on how to do the stroke - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLn218BD-lQ." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLn218BD-...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your swimming carnival!

GBGcI509aa	Damn i like what you're working with=]    and Yeah there my sleeper pick for the West.|`|v77SnunOaa	They will next year. When Lebron goes to them.|`|AvxMhVGmaa	They can, if the Lakers and the Spurs suffered major injuries.|`|DHr63ahQaa	i dont think its possible scince they will have to battle the lakers and spurs nuggets and suns witch is not easy but maybe next year if they get a good player in the draft|`|xsabcrllaa	i highly doubt it they have sooo much talent in every position but they need to mature they re all still young and they re in the west and i dont see them getting by those powerouses but when they mature in a few years i think they can have a celtic thing going on with lost of big names|`|hLjr2UUFaa	It's possible they're a very underrated team.|`|1UwKxK8yaa	HA HA HA HA HA HELL NO HAHAHAHA|`|9rVQwJ59aa	maybe? Are your from Portland? NE BABY!!!!!!|`|xe0MsmWGaa	no, even though sometimes they are MAD good .. they are too unpredictable. Alas, yesterday against the trailblazers. I do believe they can make at least the second round of playoffs.|`|DkwgogXZaa	I don't think they have enough depth to go all the way this year|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Yeah they can, they are the 4 seed so if they win in the second round vs the "Lakers" they can do it! And I think they can!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Possible, but doubtful. I think there still a year or two away.|`|qaz33UnNaa	to tell you the truth, probably not. they would have to beat either the spurs lakers or the nuggets. it is possible that they string together so wins and momentum and get to the finals but then they have to play the celtics, magic, or cavs. so probably not but maybe like 1% chance maybe.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	I wish they could!        I ? Brandon Roy!    Maybe in a few years, idk|`|98wFqBwSaa	You dumb braud|`|AA10987824	No, because they're from Oregon, and nothing out of Oregon is ever good.|`|WPbwiGafaa	yes they can because the way that there playing right now i think that the blazers have a chance with greg oden|`|LtOxnF0kaa	No|`|keUqPWVuaa	NO!    There are better teams that are more complete in their way!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	no and you need to lose weight|`|s9Pwnb87aa	I can't see that happening unless they put together a nice run (like 20-5 or so)|`|Ga11Abmzaa	no, they i have no chance especially with Hornets and Lakers in the West.
UYPfC5YVaa	Wow! You compare the 2 players as if they have the same achievements already. Yes LeBron is one heck of a player but, c'mmon, MJ already achieved almost everything as a basketball player. LeBron hasn't proven himself yet if he can carry his team to win a championship yet. Ask that question again after LeBron has past his prime.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	MJ has 6 championships, first poster.  And they don't play the same position, so obviously this is an unfair pick.  But if I had to pick one, obviously Michael Jordan, living legend.|`|FUoKu13Daa	you are comparing someone who has 6 championships and someone that has not one,<br>  <br>  We know the drive that MJ has but we do not know the drive that LBJ has,<br>  <br>  So basically I would go with what we know and that was Jordan has accomplish,  Maybe if you asked this question in 10 years the answer might be different.|`|iJ9rbpTFaa	Are you NUTS!!? comparing LBJ to MJ is ridiculous. of course MJ is the better player he can do anything, he has better shooting than Lebron and can carry his team to the finals not only to the finals but also win the finals|`|7LImpFcPaa	LMAOO<br>  HAVE THE FU*K CAN YOU COMPARE LeBRON TO MJ<br>  Seeing as how Micheal Jordan has won 8 championships<br>  and lebron aint done shitttttttttt|`|N5Cnuay0aa	MJ, because Lebron sucks.
Z5xgSATSaa	You have already made progress both in speed and distance. I would try something different, every second time you go out, don't go all out. Ride at a pace that would allow you to talk if you were with somebody else. But those days, do a much longer route. It will take you more time, but it will help build endurance, which you will need for the longer rides you plan. Once you build endurance and learn to pace yourself for longer rides, those 60-70 km rides will be easily done.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Keep building up your aerobic capacity- which will give you more speed, power, and endurance. Remember- you are the ENGINE. Keep working at it...|`|DOVbF4Piaa	The best thing you can do is learn to pedal at a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  That will allow your body to use fat as a fuel and wont tire out your legs as fast.  The next time you are out riding on a flat stretch, increase your pedal speed while staying in the same gear and you will find it easier.  Pedaling at a slower rpm and mashing on the pedals will cause you body to use glucose as a fuel and you will get a build up of lactic acid and your muscles will start to burn.    http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/ar...|`|Fx5BENIxaa	save up sell your mountain bike and buy a road bike a old used one for a few hundred. than you can get into real cycling. u can hit 25km/h without much effort on real bicycles. i can ride that 60-70 km ride in 1-2 hours, on my piece of **** bike i practically got for free.    so look into getting a real bicycle.|`|jAChLnalaa	Patience, Grasshopper. You will get faster when you get faster. Just keep riding. If you really want to improve, get a heart rate monitor and a book, and use them. Rest days are just as important as hard workout days. BTW, 25Kph (15.5 mph) isn't all that fast, but if there are hills, it's still going to be a bit of a push if you're using a mountain bike.
plvFEEqNaa	well the best way you can do this..<br>  <br>  is to do your homework on the prestige pro, know the weight, headsize, the paintjob etc...<br>  get 2 of the same sticks together and look for discrepancies, fakes usually have poor quality so it wouldnt be that hard to tell em apart...<br>  <br>  most importantly do your homework|`|MzgCC3fIaa	<a href="http://guideforyou.server.or.id" rel="nofollow">http://guideforyou.server.or.id</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
dcNT65mTaa	I think if they did release him, he'd find his way to possibly TNA where he'd blossom. They gave tons of wrestlers a major push that I didn't see why but I think it's all a matter of putting him in more matches. He has good matches, many involving him either doin something crazy like getting thrown off the top of the ladder onto a ladder outside the ring at WM24 or his match where HBK super kicked him in mid air.    PQ: Normally I'd say release him but the superstars aren't rolling in to the WWE right now. Wrestlers are relying too much on story lines than going all out every match. I say keep what you can and work on things with them.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	next year|`|M2II7hPNaa	they could do but hes come a long way since he was one half of a not very good tag team|`|6E16tR6xaa	Dude, he's a heel he's not supposed to be liked by the crowd. Also, he's very athletic and a good wrestler not to mention the US champ. They won't release him he's only getting better. So no I don't think he will be. Hope this helped!|`|AA11230418	Probably not|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	he is champion|`|4THkC6Pgaa	he is too talented to be released from wwe, he's deserved a wwe or wh title chance for a long time. in my opinion he's the one who made the money in the bank match exciting|`|iWcTmuhAaa	I guess he will leave WWE and go to TNA, cause they actually care about talent.    PQ:  Yes, cause WWE means World Wrestling "Entertainment". So if you can't entertain, they don't need any part of you.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	It would be a shame if they did, he is the most underrated pure athlete in entire wwe.|`|EmUqxoN2aa	Simple philosophy: if you're big money for them they'll keep you, if you're not (no matter how skilled you are) they will drop you like a hot potato. It's just business. They rather would make a talent-free but 100% charismatic wrestler a main eventer, instead of a modest guy with a huge wrestling repertoire.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	His aloofness is part of the character. As a face Benjamin did connect with fans - he received legit pops for his work - but this heel schtick, complete with the Butch Reed hair-dye - has not worked out. He is a tremendous worker, but will never be a killer on the mic.....if WWE dumps his contract, though, the company is in real trouble financially, since money would be the only reason to let him walk.|`|QMveJrziaa	WWE would make a big mistake by releasing Shelton. He is a future main eventer, and his mic skills are improving. If WWE lets him go, I am sure TNA would be happy to sign him, which would be great to see him on TNA. But no, I do not think WWE would be stupid enough to release him. (Then again, they did release Paul London...)    It depends how little charisma they had I guess. If they were a bleak, dull borefest of a wrestler, then most likely, but could you blame them? Wrestling is just as much a show, as it is about the wrestling.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	No He is too talented|`|3icTrKLLaa	I think he could ask to be released but WWE would say no.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	he is pretty talented  like did you see the match with  him and undertaker it was a great match
G9LSZQcaaa	Undertaker, Mick Foley|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	JBL|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Undertaker. 1st he was "Mean" Mark Calos. Then Cain. Then Undertaker. Then lord of the Ministry. Then the American Bad ***. Then he was the Phenom.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Keiji Mutoh:    The Great Muta, throughout the late '80s and early '90s for the NWA, and in his later stints in WCW with it.    Kokushi-Muso, a gimmick used only for a few shows. It is a play off of Jinsei Shinzaki's monk character known as Hakushi. Hakushi means "White Angel" while "Kokushi" means "Black Angel".    White Ninja, was used early in his career in New Japan Pro Wrestling and in Florida Championship Wrestling.    Super Black Ninja, was used in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas and also was used in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico.    Space Lone Wolf, was used briefly in New Japan and the UWF.|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	brian kendrick he was spanky the pittsburgh penguin a bell hop a punk and whatever the heck he is now|`|EmUqxoN2aa	No body beats Charlie Haas in the number of gimmicks :)    others are Mick Foley Christopher Daniels, Rikishi, Kane,|`|1z7M3Tntaa	EL Blazer has had quite a few|`|Pvg6djVSaa	hornswoggle lol
LfWghJYeaa	HBK vs undertaker for many reasons i think that it would be a great end to Takers career hopefully his streak will still be intact but HBK is Mr.WM.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	stone cold just because he retired  but i do prefer hbk|`|AA11482019	What about HBK vs Stone Cold?|`|6nY99hPmaa	i rather see hbk vs Austin.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	A triple threat hardcore match|`|G9LSZQcaaa	HBK VS Stone cold VS Undertaker- Triple Threat Steel Cage Match.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Taker vs John Cena|`|4THkC6Pgaa	that wouldn't make any sense, if hbk vs austin was to happen at wm 25 then the wwe would obviously make austin win, but where does that lead for hbk. i should definitely be hbk vs taker|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker  and if possible then, Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Peoples Champ' The Rock.
Upk0n5Z0aa	practice proper breathing and trigger squeezee|`|6pUzzsuhaa	improving your shooting skills- this goes with ANY gun-<br>  <br>  -- make sure your stance is correct<br>  -- make sure that the butt of the gun is sitting properly on/in your shoulder- there's a little pocket that you'll find after shooting for a while where the butt fits perfectly<br>  -- take your time, don't rush any shot- weather your hunting or shooting at targets or shooting competitively<br>  -- get some more 'range' time under your belt- the more you shoot, the more familiar you'll become with how the gun feels on your shoulder and where it fits best for you, how your stance affects your shooting, etc..<br>  -- make sure your shooting with the correct eye- eye dominance- you may be right handed, but that doesn't mean that you'll shoot that way too. <br>  to see which eye is dominant- look at something a good distance on the other side of the room (something small). point at it with both eyes open. close one eye (say your right eye). if what your pointing at moves, then your left eye dominant, if it doesn't move, then your right eye dominant- do that with both eyes<br>  - you may have to start shooting a different way depending on which way your shooting now and which eye you find out is dominant.
QfvmFbVSaa	NO NO NO the true reason is that almost everyone has had someone they know or loved taken or threatend with a gun at one time or another and its just easy to blame it on the gun itself. but truth be known more people have been saved by guns than taken everyday. and like its been said before guns dont kill people/ people kill people. if they didnt have a gun in their hand it would be a knife or stick or even a rock if you had something they wanted bad enough. so you dont need to blame the weapon blame the person behind it.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	They are afraid of them.|`|AA11694178	The vast majority of people know about guns only through what they read in the papers and what they see on television.  Their knowledge of guns is limited to murder, robbery, rape and war.  Many are also brought up knowing animals only as pets and the Disney anthropomorphic animals.  Hunting to them is just an extension of murder that they wee on TV and read about in the papers.  It is a very negative picture of guns and it is the only picture that they get.  NRA tries very hard to elucidate these people through their many programs.  We as shooters and hunters owe it to ourselves to do all we can to show and teach the public about the good recreational use of guns.  To do this, we need to join NRA and recruit others to join so NRA can provide these needed programs to educate the public.  We also need to take a friend or even better a kid out and teach them to shoot.  Let them understand that the gun is not bad, it is what bad people do with a gun that is bad.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	The fear of the unknown is terrible indeed.  And misinformation is rampant, and for reasons less than ethical.  It is very easy to dislike something you know nothing about, and when unreasonable fear has been installed to go with ignorance, a dislike is formed.  Education would be the answer to this, but the majority seem to be in denial, and are not even interested in educating themselves.  Until people learn about guns they will be needlessly frightened, which creates this dislike. Sadly, they think they already know all there is to know, and are therefore unlikely;y to learn much.  J|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Mental mind conditioning and a profound detachment from the machines they despise. My whole family on my mom's side is like that.

And yet she keeps asking me questions on what gun to get.<br>  <br>  My dad's side, one's a felon, the other lives in chicago and is mentally slow, but not retarded, and the other has as many guns as me but hasn't used them in years.

This kind of weapon is not difficult to use at all - yes, slightly trickier to use effectively than hollywood would have us believe, but hardly difficult. More or less, you point and shoot. A quote I've heard somewhere (that, unfortunately, I can't remember where from) - you point the gun and stuff dies.<br>  <br>  You move up the line to say, assault weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, hunting rifles and the like. Whilst more difficult to operate effectively than their handgun counterparts, they are still incredibly easy to use for the amount of damage they can cause. One well placed shot from a rifle will kill just about anyone. Then you consider that an assault rifle can put out hundreds of rounds per minute. It's insane how potent they are.<br>  <br>  Even a weapon such as a missile launcher - whilst a lot more difficult to use than traditional firearms, and almost certainly requiring some degree of training to use effectively - you've got to understand that for something that one to two people can operate, it packs a huge punch. Destroying buildings and vehicles? You bet.<br>  <br>  So why do people show a dislike to these kinds of weapons? Because they are so easy to use for the damage they can cause. When you consider how easy they are to get in some places, and how unstable the minds of some people are, having such an easy-to-use-but-highly-destructive force available is just asking for disaster.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, death is a necessary part of existance in order to keep the population levels out of control. However, from an emotional point of view, highly unexpected and very avoidable death is often the hardest to deal with. Easy access to such potent weapons, I would imagine (though don't have the stats to prove) directly increases the levels of avoidable death in the world - it's just common sense that it would.|`|LWxmRKnnaa	My parents hate firearms because they are used to "kill and are dangerous".

QidW9DRfaa	Firstly, i'm a Schumacher fan, but i'm not stupid enough to defend his more questionable tactics shall we say. . . <br>  <br>  To my knowledge Michael has never said anything to confirm or deny he was blatantly out of order about 'the incident'- even though we all know what happened! (wink!) He was the same about the incident with Jacques. <br>   <br>  Incidentally, in the FiA Season review of that  year, Damon's reaction immediately after in the pits says it all to me, he was incandescent yet pretty bloody clear about what happened, as was everyone with forward facing eyes!<br>  We know Michael has a sensitivity to 'fight' in regards to a flight or fight reflex and with the incident in Jerez in 97, he merely confirmed that Adelaide 94 was no accident. What would be the point in his admitting it? He would only let his haters hate him more and his fans would think no less or no better of him<br>  Let sleeping dogs lie!<br>  <br>  Personally, i loved Prost/Senna BLATANT shoving off track mechanics of the 89/90 seasons. hahahah!  sheer venom, yet sheer class!<br>  <br>  Edit: Schumi (below me)- i think you're being a tad disingenuous towards Damon. Yes, he did have the sublimely perfect Williams at his disposal and had some superb wins but, lets be frank, he was racing against a genius who made his efforts look less than worthwhile! Damon didn't make the best of his tools but, who the heck else on the grid could've pushed Michael as well as he did?|`|3Db7KL0naa	.<br>  <br>  Whether Hill was in a better car or not has no relevance. Schhh had a clearly defined "line of action" on many occasions when put in situation where a dangerous or deliberate cheat was required - this was true in all classes of racing and well documented from F3 onwards. <br>  <br>  In the 1990 Macau F3 race he deliberately took out Hakkinen to win the championship. You can see in this vid at 50 secs that he deliberately flicks across to block a clearly faster Hakkinen. Hakkinen is obviously ouraged, as he should be - even if Schhh had been driving a Nissan Micra he still couldn't get past with such deliberate and dangerous "tactics". Schhh later said to Hakkinen that "it was an accident and hadn't seen Hakkinen", but admitted later on German TV that he had deliberately steered into Hakkinen as he didn't want to lose the title. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQG9_bfjd5Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQG9_bfjd...</a><br>  <br>  The move on Hill in 1994 clearly came from the same thought process. Patrick Head stated that if the future of F1 and Williams had not been so under question with the sad loss of Senna the same year, they would have lodged a complaint with the FIA, but they did not, the primary reason being that they thought F1 had suffered enough during that year....a very lucky Schhh achieved his tainted title.<br>  <br>  From 1990 on, he learnt to keep his mouth shut. So, no, he would never admit driver error. He didn't even apologise last year when he hit a barn door and injured a guy behind it....it could've easily been a child not a door, with different reper(con)cussions.....<br>  <br>  1997 saw another Schhh "natural" tendency to steer towards (???) danger rather than away from, as per the normal cognitive approach, and he was stripped of 2nd place in the championship. A position he was not aiming for and probably couldn't care less about anyway!!!<br>  <br>  Some people would applaud this type of behavior, but I am not one. I think winning at any cost; the Nike "Doesn't Play Well With Others" approach to "sport" and "sportsmanship" is indefensible, dangerous and detracts from great viewing. I understand this may well be thought of as outdated, but remember my words next time you're behind a weaving, slow moving caravan, because that is essentially how Schhh would defend a position if it came down to his very inflexible wire.<br>  <br>  Schhh's at-any-cost tactics, cost him at least one fan of his uncanny car control, namely moi, but I know I was not alone. <br>  <br>  .|`|jajmF5Uvaa	You must remember that Schumacher, although being a good driver, also makes mistakes. (it's how we gain experience) When watching a replay of the incident, it it clear that Schumi made a mistake and realising that Hill was somewhere behind him, made a "fumbling effort" to defend his position. That was a second mistake which ended in tears. Schumi is is intelligent enough to realise that by taking someone else out, chances are very good you take yourself out as well.<br>  As for the Damon Hill fans. It took him six years to win the championship in the top car at the time. Nothing really to be proud of.|`|KTxxd700aa	Schumacer has always pleaded his innocence, both Hill and Patrick Head have publicly said it was intentional, I wonder why Hill attempted to go on  the inside of Schumi, I suppose he didn't know Schumacer was damaged, Hills car only had a bent shock absorber, if it was touring cars, he could of continued!<br>  Still, Hill should of won the championship before Australia in such a superior car.

He is not playing to the level of his contract yet.<br>  Marvin will still be there<br>  Al Horford will be a 20 10 guy and a force in the middle for the team.<br>  Acie Law will still be a backup PG in the league.

Ui2WJH4Iaa	don't forget the .458 socom.  better than both of them!|`|52ML3pmSaa	Oh God  thats a hard pick. I love all three, but the .458socom is the best. Second is .50beowulf and third is the .450bushmaster. MY OPINION, find what is cheapest and easyest to access, don't forget if you like overkill like I do, they make a .50BMG upper too.|`|AA11694178	Both cartridges are certainly going to "romp and stomp".  Both will generate very similar kinetic energy but the higher velocity of the Bushmaster gives it a longer functional range.  Which you choose will depend on whether you want to shoot at targets up to 250 to 300 yards or would prefer to keep them under 150 yards.  At shorter ranges, the .50 Beowulf has the advantage.  Over 150 yards, the .450 Bushmaster has the advantage.  Pick  your range and then pick your caliber.  Both have more than enough romp and stomp.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	I'd be thrilled with either.  Whichever of these calibers you ultimately decide on, don't forget to take ammunition availability into account.

AA11524511	best thing to do is make sure you have a nice proper diet, lots of veggies, and carbs aren't bad either since you will burn fat quickly by running, and drink LOTS of water daily. stretch your leg muscles alot, you'll need the flexibility. go jogging for a few miles, several times a week (stretch before and after) to tone and condition your leg muscles and to get your lungs accustomed. pay attention to your breathing and posture, if your shoulders or back hurt, your form needs work. weight training helps, but don't overdo it. cardio workouts are very good. there are some easy drills you can do to improve your speed as well. . . try some of these: http://appl027.lsu.edu/athletics/tigerpo...|`|y4yKmqQLaa	I don't know where you are in age or health or experience, so I suggest that you walk, building up to 5  miles a day. A nice slow pace, gradually building up to a gentle run. You could walk for 50 paces, run for 50 paces. Jumping jacks, push ups are good.  DAncing is great too.
