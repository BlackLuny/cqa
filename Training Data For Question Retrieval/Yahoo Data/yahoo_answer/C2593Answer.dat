VTtka1ubaa	I am assuming you are talking about the convertible.  It sounds like it could be the piston that drives the roof is not getting power or is broken.  I would check that first.  <br>  <br>  If it is not that, then it could be an electrical short and those are a bear to find (I do not have good experience in finding those).|`|hEZaWs9yaa	If fuses are OK then, roof sw. is not working. Otherwise SID would say Ck. soft top, unless new and not prog. for convertible. Most commom reason for top not working is a broken shear pin in the tonneau drive. Need tech 2 to read codes.
0PU52tVYaa	Check out craigslist.com  I actually had a 2006 Katana 750 for sale about 7 months ago, I also wasn't too far from you (corpus christi). The katana was a great all-around bike. I wouldn't give more that $4000 for one though. Good Luck
6DQ8LzxFaa	You need a one channel sub amp, aka a mono block. Which CVRs you get, the dual 4-ohm coils or the dual 2-ohm coils? It makes a difference as to which amp to get. You need the amp to be rated at the power you need, at the final impedence you will have after wiring the subs together. <br>  <br>  To the other answer: You are a retard. I have ran, and seen friends run, 2-channel amps, 4-channel amps, and mono blocks- all on a pair of subs. I have ran four 12's on a 2-channel also. No problems, as long as the final impedence of the subs matches what the amp is rated to handle, and the power output of the amp is within the range you need for the subs.|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	You need atleast a 5 channel amplifier you need an amp that has as many channels as you do subs so if you have 3 subs get a 3 channel amp if you try to power 3 subs with 1 amp you wont bump worth ****.|`|RYRug15Aaa	For three 12's. You could probably get that Hifonics amp and it would sound great! Just bridge the wires of the three subs and your all set. That's a pretty good size amp, I guarentee it will pound thoughs three 12's!!! I have a 2 chan amp pushing 3 12's right now in my car. Don't listen to the first guy who said you need at least a 5 chan amp, he does'nt know what he's talking about.

UcXaXtrpaa	The people who say about the economy etc,i have my own true story on my thoughts of people against Japanese cars and how the Japanese have spoilt things.<br>  I was parked behind a car a while ago when the passenger came across to me,who happened to be a little old lady,she said we really like your car,but what is it.I replied by telling her it was a Nissan by now the driver had stepped out of the car and was an old man also.<br>  Once she had heard the word Nissan she looked at me in disgust and said we never buy Japanese,in that second her mobile rung to which she pulled out a Japanese made mobile phone.  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for cars we are on our 5th Nissan and driven one into 3 countries on a road trip and that car was 13 years old at the time,we have also owned one with 250k on the clock when we got it and it still ran like new when we sold it.We are selling soon for our 6th Nissan so i guess that must say something.<br>  My friend always has Toyota and he sticks with those ad they have been good to him also.<br>  Best bet is pick a car that has been well looked after and play it safe that way.|`|h5Bf33ieaa	Let me tell you Nissan is excellent!!  my first Nissan  was an Altima 2.5 very good car economic, nice style, love it! now I own a Pathfinder v6 economic seats 7 people ,comfortable and I love it this is my 5 year with Nissan cars .also excelent systems and features I love nisan I never had a problem also my husband has a Nissan frontier  and he love it  never had a problem too good luck!!|`|g48toTovaa	japanese cars are alot better made in japan...<br>  i wouldnt buy a japanese car made in america...its the same thing but it jus dosnt feel rite...but i love nissans...nissans last for a long time and they r really good for tunning...it depends on wat kind of car ur looking for...if u like fast cars..and u have money i would get like a r34...|`|HR0mXBFMaa	My friend owns a nissan sentra, its like 14 yrs old and has broken ONLY a few times!

AA11032586	Is it currently a mudding truck? We really need a little more info. What needs to be done to "legalize" the truck? Does it have a motor, tranny, doors?
iYG6lLbVaa	there would be drill holes in dash board where radios were mounted,if it has the original rims on it they would be steel with the round holes,you should be careful with ex cop cars even though they are serviced they have a hard life and repairs they have had are sometimes pretty shonky because the repairer knows it's only going to break again due to the rough treatment.
mR5ZtjqWaa	jet engines do not generate torque (well they do, but not in the same way as propeller aircraft)<br>  Turbine engines are generally throttled up at around half power give or take 10%, to allow the pilots to check their "vitals". Since shoving the power up can cause some surges in engine temp/pressure, you leave a second or two to see if they come back down, indicating normal operation, and then add the rest. The moments pause separates the many things the pilots must check during takeoff into easier to handle pieces and reduces the likelihood the pilots misses something in the instruments indicating imminent disaster. Also, it is to make sure both engines are producing an equal amount of thrust, since too much thrust on one side can be deadly, especially on takeoff, where engines are pushed up near redline.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Prometheus and David S pretty much have it covered. I just want to add that in modern jets, that first bit of power is added by hand. Once the pilots check the vitals, they push a button and allow the auto-throttle to take care of advancing the throttles to take-off power (which, surprisingly to non-aviators, is rarely full power).|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	This is done mainly to verify that thrust is increasing symmetrically and normally and that there are no obvious anomalies in the engines.  Once this is apparent, the throttles are set for take-off power.  Not all aircraft or operators require this procedure, but it is quite common, and it generally never hurts.|`|JNTQwvtTaa	Is there any engine outside of a competitive setting you want to just redline for the fun of it?<br>  <br>  It throttle up my Briggs and Stratton in steps for crying out loud.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	It's called an N1 check, as somebody said before -- you're checking the vitals.

It is quick and comfortable. I also owned a BMW 330i and loved it. If I were thinking of getting a G37x I would strongly recommed that you at least test drive a 335xi. My bmw handled better and was a sportier ride. The 335xi is a twin turbo i-6 and a rocket ship.  The G37x is no slouch but dosent feel as responsive.  Trust me please test dirve both of them before you decide. The G37x is a great car but my opinion is that the 335 is more refined.|`|hj9dIgDOaa	its awsome make sure you get it stickshift....i just got mine and voided my warranty right away too (turbo) extremely fast wouldnt trade it for another car great car........
13kMNf0faa	Simple, find your nearest flight school and ask about an introductory flight. It will cost around $100 and the time you spend will actually count toward your PPL. And I honestly wouldn't have wanted to fly in a Cessna 152 for my first flight. The thing is narrower than a twin bed, anyone over 5'0 would feel at least slightly uncomfortable flying it. I would also say it's sluggish and underpowered. 172's better :p The 152 also gets thrown around a lot by turbulence because it's very light and has very low wing loading. <br>  <br>  Also, if you and your friend want to be designers and engineers, then you should probably find an aviation high school and college that will give you training in those fields. And after you graduate, just go butter up Burt Rutan : )|`|YupMCYHlaa	If you really want to be a pilot, your best bet is the military.  All the services have pilots.  The govt. spends over a million dollars to train a pilot, and it's better training than you could get anywhere else.  Then, when you get out of the service, airlines know you've been well-trained, and you have thousands of hours of flying time.  And you would need to have a college degree before going into the service.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn to fly on your own before going into the service, that's fine too.  It's a bit expensive, though.  If you hang around a small flying club at a small airport, you can usually work in return for flying and training hours.  Often they are looking for someone to pump gas, keep records, stuff like that.<br>  <br>  As for design and engineering, nobody designs airplanes anymore. 8^)  Airplanes are designed by whole teams of people.  You could get a degree in aeronautical engineering--you're going to need it anyway to get into the service.  After the military you could go back to school on the GI bill and get your master's.  You could join a company that builds business jets, there are a few of those, and new generations of planes are being designed all the time.<br>  <br>  It's a very ambitious plan, but I've known people who had plans like this and actually carried them out.  You can start now by getting just the best grades you can, so you can get into a good college to get that engineering degree.  How's your math? 8^)|`|DvlwN9kdaa	You're already the right age to begin pilot training.  <br>  <br>  Other 14-year-olds have soloed already.<br>  <br>  Get a sectional chart, find the local airports, and schedule flight lessons.  Get the FAA books and begin studying in earnest.  Maybe work at the airport if you can get a better deal on plane rent.  <br>  <br>  Get your certificates and ratings, go to college, instruct during summers, and fly charter or airline after graduation.|`|NRJ1tmbZaa	You need to either (a.) be filthy rich, or (b.) join the air force.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	First question:<br>  <br>  There are many schools around that will teach you everything you need to know, and test you for your license for personal use.   Aircraft like a Cessna aren't very hard to get into.  Now, if you want to go commercial, your going to pay a LOT more for that type of schooling, closer to the cost of an actual college degree, without the help from college grants.  If this is really your goal, I'd look at going into the Navy first (most military pilots are in the navy, NOT the air force).  That way you can get most of your training paid for you, not to mention is looks great on a commercial airline application.  There are different levels of commercial aviation as well, Pilot, second, and so on.  You won't just get a job as a pilot, expect to have to climb the ladder.  Shooting for a smaller company to start out with will make it easier as well, instead of aiming for Northwest, shoot for Mesaba (Northwest Airlink, they are Northwest Airlines smaller partner, dealing mostline tith c-RJ, Saab Turbo Probs, and the Dash 8- the Dash 8 is being phased out if it hasn't been already).  <br>  <br>  As for running a company catering to corporate clients, be ready to dump a LOT of money into it.  Your going to want a top of the line Jet, like a lear, and the insurance is going to be high as can be.  Then you have to compete with other companies that are already in business doing this.  You have to build prestige, give your customers a reason to use you.  Either you get people to their destinations the fastest, or you provide the best on board entertainment or something along those lines.  Or, you'll be stuck getting customers by being the cheapest, which means your income will be cut.  <br>  <br>  In all, its a long road, and not an easy one.  Don't give up, and you'll make it though.  You can do it!|`|sXAPuQ2uaa	I love seeing this ambition!<br>  <br>  First of all, make sure you get good grades in school.  But don't put all of your eggs in one basket.  Make sure you still have a life outside of aviation.  Join a football team, or hockey team or whatever.  Both airlines and the military want a well rounded person.  They want someone who will be fun to work with in the cockpit and be able to work as a team.  Also, volunteer work and general work around the community is highly valued on these applications.  Keep fit, and have fun.<br>  <br>  Also, in Canada, a great book to have is called "From The Ground Up".  It teaches you all of the basics of flight and Air Law/ navigation, meteorology, etc..  I am sure there is a US equivalent to that book.  Some of these other pilots can probably answer that.  Just reading that in your spare time can help you exponentially when it comes time for Ground School.<br>  <br>  Also, I believe the age to start ground school is 15.  You should go to your local flying club and see if you can start attending classes.  I know where I go, its a one time fee and you can attend classes for the rest of your life.  But it isn't cheap either.  It cost me somewhere around $525 to sign up.  But that also included all of my materials.<br>  <br>  As for you and your friend designing your own airplanes, that gets more and more rare every day.  Planes are built by teams, not individuals.  If you can work a name up for yourself and invest A LOT of money, you may be able to start your own team.  A masters in Aeronautical Engineering would probably be a minimum if you try to take this route.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in your endeavors. <br>  <br>  Dingo.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Two things.<br>  <br>  1. YOUR CAR HAS A COLD AIR INTAKE. Go look at your engine, and you will very clearly see that the intake leads away from the hot air of the engine, to the cold air near the bumper. You are not putting something on the car that it does not already have. Total gains? Less than 2 horsepower. Have fun with that "performance."<br>  <br>  2. After you look at the engine, it should be incredibly obvious how to take it off, and put the other on. It's maybe 5-6 bolts. If you can't figure it out, you shouldn't mess with your car at all.
VItj8zdAaa	they will be black hoses coming off your upper intake manifold.  is it a supercharged engine?  if that's the case, the hoses will be coming off your throttle body.  they will route under the snout of the supercharger and back towards the map sensor.  if it's not supercharged, they will be easy to spot on the front of the upper intake, one goes to the purge and one goes to the fuel press. regulator
13kMNf0faa	Depends on the pilot and airline/routes flown. Some transatlantic pilots are gone for 2 weeks out of the month and are home with their families for the other 2. Some domestic pilots are away for 2 or 3 days and are home for the rest of the week. A regional airline pilot can get up in the morning, fly a few flights between LGA and BOS, and be home in time for dinner every weekday. Some pilots like me might decide not to have a family and focus solely on their career.|`|ZTMjXz1saa	It depends on you and your family.  I wouldn't say I was lonely, but when you're gone more than 50% of the time, you start to ask yourself "why the heck am I doing this?"  Things like online video chat and online games (that you play with your family) do help to an extent.  It's worse if you have kids.  It's hard for your spouse not to feel like a single parent.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	No.  Married guys LIKE to be away.  They're not lonely.|`|NpStGn5baa	yes. i been married to my wife for 4 years now and I always joke that with her that we've been married half the time. But, if you find a family that is as understanding as mine you won't really feel lonely, when you no that you have a people who care and depend on you.<br>  <br>  The only time you'll probably feel lonely is when you've just join a company and of are bottom of the seniority list.

XrZbqY4Vaa	This sounds like an air leak.  Check the manifold gaskets.  Take a can of oil and squirt around the various gaskets and connections - Not to much and one at a time.  After squirting around a gasket listen to see if any change in idling.  Will become become slower where there is a leak.  If this occurs replace gasket or rubber connections.  Wipe oil off after you have completed job<br>  <br>  Other possible reason is a choke that is not working correctly.  Check and see if choke is opening properly.  Take off air cleaner and check if choke disk  completely opens.  If not then replace electric choke mechanism|`|56e60c1b1cbc4ad26edd9a37b25f4792aa	you might have a vacuum leak, take carb cleaner and while its running spay around carb and intake gskts on cyl. head , if idle goes up you found your leak, if thaty doesn't help rebuild carb. also you might need valve adjustment .|`|3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	Well the noise and the idle may not be connected.  For example your throwout bearing may chatter a bit at low speeds but then vanish at higher ones.<br>  <br>  Id go with the vacuum leak or possibly a stuck choke.  The carb cleaner check mentioned earlier is a good trick plus you get a clean carb (exterior) as a bonus.  Check the gasket between the carb and manifold,  rrww <br>  <br>  Also disconnect each vacum hose and cap or plug it (one at a time) to see if you have a bad hose with a hidden crack.  Don't forget that there may be some smog lines too if you have a 'California' car. <br>  <br>  Ok. so maybe its NOT a vacume leak.. next try the plugs.  A fouled plug may not have a spark at low speeds but at higher ones the coil may put out juuuuusssst enough spark to jump it.  There are only four plugs so pull each one and check the gap (or if it is that time simply replace them with new, gaped ones.<br>  <br>  Ok.. working backwards the same problem can be applied to a cracked or pitted distributor cap or rotor.  Check those to see if you have a bad cap.  Also check the wires cuts or burns and replace andy defective wires.<br>  <br>  One last possibility is simply a clogged fuel filter.  but that usually results in stuttering under load.. not at idle so save that one for last.<br>  <br>  good luck...<br>  .

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	The 912 is not a car that is well suited to the search for more power.  With a skilled driver it can be fairly quick, and mods that aim to enhance it's strengths can be effective, but power?  Power will tend to be among the costlier mods, and least effective.  If you are looking for a few horsepower, looking into an early factory sports exhaust along with adjusting the carbs will probably do that.  Beyond that?  Rebuilding the engine with different pistons and cylinders and moving to a more aggressive cam (though you will spend alot compared to the gains you will get and may compromise the drivability of the car to make a meaningful gain); or looking at a different engine (which will bring a whole new set of challenges since it will change the weight distribution of the car: either with a 911 engine making the back heavier like a 911, or many of the other swaps with their higher centers of gravity that will make the car very top heavy in turns and destroy it's handling - as well as require suspension upgrades and brake upgrades to handle the greater weight and power).<br>  <br>  The best places to look for more performance in a 912 are small upgrades:  moving to lightweight wheels if not already fitted, better tires, lightening the car where you can, and improving your own driving skills... all of these are less expensive than looking at the engine, and will have much greater impact on the car.<br>  <br>  As for it's value... an all original longhood 912 in excellent condition can command some decent money as they've become increasingly sought out by collectors.  However you are dealing with a car that has been repainted and one that has been converted to the later style bumpers.  While these might be good upgrades in practical terms, they will make the car a non-consideration for any collector.  If you have documentation on the repaint from the shop (ideally with pictures of it being done to show how it was done and that any rust issues or such were addressed properly and not just covered up), the devaluation from the repaint will be minimal.  But lacking that and the bumper change, it could be in the $4-5k range if cosmetically good and in good running order... maybe a little more for the right buyer, but also could be less given current market conditions.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The 912 is not about power, it's about handling and finesse and smoothness.  Don't f*ck with it. It's a classic just as it is.  Sports cars didn't have 800 hp in those days, they were about class.

Drive it and love it just as it is, or sell it to someone who will appreciate it.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what it's worth, but someone into vintage Porsches would know.  You could look on EBay Motors to see what they're going for, or call a vintage sports car dealer in your area if any of them are still in business these days.  It's worth a lot, though.

gUaXZPYmaa	the price of gas does not go up and down in price like other things that are controlled by supply and demand. and no it didnt go down because they added ethanol, theyve always added ethanol. the reason price of oil went down is because our economy is down and less people are taking trips and using gas, BUT petroleum production is controlled by OPEC, organization of petroleum exporting countries, and they alone control the amount of oil they put on the market and they can do whatever they want, notice how our economy is getting even worse yet gas isnt getting lower? its because they are lowering the amount of petroleum theyre producing. <br>  <br>  the price will soon go down when more hybrid and electric vehicles are on the road, because soon theyll find out how competitively priced they are and will have to lower the price of gas in order to be competitive against alternate fuels.|`|RiQA4Epraa	theyve had ethanol in gas for a long time..<br>  <br>  and e10 here, is 180<br>  while e85 herre is 165<br>  <br>  15 cents difference,...|`|s2yZ48mPaa	The price of oil changes with supply and demand and the economy.

3186c0df134bfa45f13766dbbe42b59faa	I actually did this once. You need to find some fairly small axles and wheels to moung to the bottom of the mouse trap. Once you have them mounted, you tie a string to the actual trap part of the device (the metal bar that snaps onto the mouse) and then wrap the other end around one of the axles. If you look at it, you will see which axel would make the most sense. You have to make sure that the trap has been "set" so to speak so that when you release the metal trap part, it will pull the string, thus making the car move forward, or backwards depending on how you wanna look at it.

7BHIyMFmaa	It's an overpriced Passat (which is overpriced to begin with).  For 30k-33k I'd be looking at a BMW 3 series, or a MB C Class.

Q76l9KRkaa	Well, if your on a budget then i will list the 3 most common things to upgrade.  To get more performance out of a engine, you need to increase the speed in which air comes in and exhaust leaves.  I would up-grade in the intake to a cold air set up, get a quality set of headers and a free flowing exhaust.  Find a dyno in your area and have them tune it.  That should net you some real noticeable power upgrades.<br>  <br>  If you want to go beyond that, then i would look into some sort of forced induction, but that would take a little bit of money|`|O3qsmr82aa	Intake, chip, headers and exhaust will give you maybe 20hp at the rear wheels.  A perfomance shop with a chassis dyno will be able to tune the optimal timing, and air/fuel mix.  Running high-octane fuel will allow you to run more timing.  That truck will sound great with headers and Flowmaster cat-back exhaust!|`|3D5D6nB1aa	you listed the best simple mods to do.  stick with summit or jegs for parts. Call the tech line, tell them what you have, and what your looking to get out of the truck and your budget. They will make great suggestions as to what will give you the most bang for your buck within your budget!! hope this helps 1800230303-summit 18003454545-jegs!

AA10782769	Don't spend your life trying to find the easy way out.  Man up take responsibility and pay the ticket.  I know it's $381.00 and that's a lotta' money you could be using for something else.  On the other hand however it could be $381.00 plus the cost of repairing or replacing someone else's vehicle not to mention your own.  Worse yet you could have killed or badly injured someone else or yourself as a result of running a red light.  Lastly if you're on camera running a red light I don't know of any way you could get out of it.  Considering what could have happened I'd say you got off pretty light at $381.00.|`|EDiJe38Taa	Generally if you go into court you can haggle with the judge. It's worth a try.|`|69442f28405cb7b4b2d9ecac676332ceaa	There are no good tactics to beat a camera ticket... they got me with three photos from different angles, recorded my speed as I made the right on red, and a short video clip I could watch on computer when you log into the city's website with the ticket number that's mailed to your house.  I was as guilty as sin!  I mailed in my check right away to avoid having the fine being doubled for late payment.  And they're usually not handled by judges... a hearing officer or administrator handles your case should you attempt to appeal.  That way, you can't use your lawyer, cause it's not really court.  Most cases in Chicago are found guilty unless you can prove the equipment was faulty... not very likely.

DEXSuqT7aa	Could be combination of things, most likely air/fuel issue, like if carb needs rebuilt or idle adjusted,  if fuel injected maybe faulty injectors leaking. could be MAF, if any particle on wire it will run like crap, if you know it needs a tune up, do it, check wires, change plugs, filter, clean/check MAF, if really got time do leakdown test on injectors.<br>  <br>  When was last time Fuel filter changed?  might wanna do that to.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	it means that you can not let it idle by itself and expect to it to keep running. you will have to restart the engine.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	There are numerous reasons why a car might not idle - everything from a defective idle controller to a vacuum leak, from a stuck EGR valve to a bad MAF for just a few possibilities.
3NoQuoWuaa	In most jurisdictions, you can settle between yourselves. The traffic police want to be involved only in serious cases.

RYDSc5Bqaa	There are two ways to find your gear ratio.<br>  <br>  First there should be a tag on the center housing attached by one of the cover bolts. Clean it off and it should have the ratio on it.<br>  <br>  Second you can jack up one of the rear tires while leaving the opposite tire on the ground, put the transmission in neutral and turn the lifted tire two times while counting the turns of the driveshaft. Four turns = 4.10, four and a half turns = 4.56 etc. This works well with open differentials but if you have a locker then just lift both tires and turn them once and count the driveshaft turns.

j3f8m6REaa	Hell, no! Those old beasts usually had shift linkages on the outside of the transmission that would misalign, hang-up, wear out -- clutches were all manual and would splinter bone in heavy traffic, the cars were hard to start and even harder to drive in bumper to bumper traffic, got miserable fuel mileage, had bigger turning radius' than an aircraft carrier, the bodys were crap, the suspensions were hard as rock, the cooling systems could barely keep up and the brakes were theoretical at best.<br>  <br>  God, I loved those cars......|`|15a395b81e70741dfdfed45167d39207aa	Why would it be just couple extra gears to shift. If you can drive a stick it should not be a problem.|`|2HKSwHkSaa	I wouldn't say they were easier to drive.  Once one gets the hang of driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, it pretty  much becomes second nature.  The reason that modern vehicles these days have more forward gears is due to the desire to have better fuel economy.  In a typical vehicle with a 4 speed, the engine would spin at say 3500 rpm while cruising on the highway.  In a 6 speed, that may drop to 1800, thereby lowering the amount of revolutions the engine is spinning, in that gear, subsequently putting less strain on the vehicle.|`|aa9gieAIaa	that kind of depends but those old ones are usually bears to shift. then again a 99 mustang t45 trans is a bit much too. smaller lighter cars tend to be easier like the vw gti. very easy to shift fast. the old muncie and  t-10 tranys used in old muscle cars are hard for most people to shift fast.
6LTbHCCKaa	I've ridden a manual car for about 5 years now and just recently did the msf course last week. I'd say driving the car is easier only because you have a lot to think about on the bike, like is someone going to hit you is there something on the road that you need to move out of the way for and its easier to forget what gear you're in on the bike than in the car. However, there was two groups in the msf course ( i was in the later time of the day) and I had talked to a couple of the people in the morning and most of them had never ridden a motorcycle and most of the people in my class never had ridden a motorcycle and everyone in both classes pass so I'm quite sure you'll figure out the bike in no time.|`|DEXSuqT7aa	Shifting on a bike is a lot easier, even though shifting a manual car is easy too.<br>  The test course doesn't usually involve a lot of shifting mainly driving thru cones and around a little(little) course to make sure you turn good and stop on the line.<br>  You will pass as long as you don't put your foot down while your going thru the course.<br>  <br>  I never got my endorsement, they rarely pull bikes over unless you do something stupid.

If you are used to using a clutch to pull away in a car the changing is simpler and when on the move it is just a case of remembering up changes to a higher gear, down changes to a lower gear.|`|oBNc9arMaa	After 10+ years of driving atv's dirt bikes etc. you think I would be good at driving a standard vehicle.

I know that you have to have the valve cover gasket (seal) you also will need the rubber seals that go around the spark plug holes, your also going to need the (END CAP)seals as well. The end caps are what holes the cams down, there's bolts running through them that holes them into place.|`|voC2ffmzaa	I pretty sure your talking about the Head gasket.(your car is smoking?)and for the cylinders it would be the piston rings and the Oil ring.

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	You are correct - two cams above the head is a "duel over head cam" engine. <br>  Any O rings or gaskets would apply to the valve cover and/or head itself, and not to the cams. <br>  If the concern is an oil leak, it could be a front cam seal depending on the engine.|`|k55p1pKraa	All of the small engines like 4 cylinder either have a single(SOHC) or a dual (DOHC) cam to run them  The differents between the two is that a SOHC works both intake & exhaust valves were a DOHC  has two cams one to run the intake valves and the other one runs the exhaust valves.Yes both of these heads have the cam/or cams on top of the head. Now when you get to big block engines the cam run through the middle of the engine, each head has the intake & exhaust vales a long with rocker arms, push rods and the lifters are down inside of the engine , when the engine turns over it turns the cam which then pushes up the lifters & push rods causing the rocker arms to push the valves up and down.I hope this helps you to understand  better.|`|DEXSuqT7aa	You are probably talking about a 4 cylinder motor, as there are two cams on top of engine. one for intake one for exhaust, thus dual cam.<br>  the gasket for the cover is the valve cover gasket. the only other gasket is under the head, and that is the head gasket.<br>  <br>  Yes you can get gaskets at any auto part store. look for the valve cover gasket.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	A "dual overhead cam" is a type of engine.

That way you will have all the necessary specs and information.|`|txoXobsAaa	one has just a single bumpstick while the other has 2 tittiesticks|`|pIEw1cnOaa	Essentially what you have with a DOHC engine (dual overhead cam) is that you have 2 heads on your engine to put it in simple terms.  You have your cam housing and then you have you actual head where the valves are located.  Usually, and I say usually because with today's vehicles you never know, there is a gasket between the cam housing and the head.  And yes the cams are above the head.  With over head cams it is the actual cam separated by "lifters" (small ones at that) that opens the valves in the engine, compared to a pushrod engine where the cam is in the block directly above the crankshaft and when the cam turns it pushes the lifters that above it up, in turn pushing a 4-7 inch steel rod up causing the rockers (that are on the head) to create a see-saw effect, forcing one end up forcing the other down which opens the valve.  But there could be a different technical name for it but usually the gasket is just called the camshaft housing gasket.  Also, there is a special bolt pattern that MUST be followed when removing the cams and heads.  this is so the head and housing are not warped or damaged in the process.  There are also special torque specs that also MUST be followed when re-tightening to avoid the above mentioned.  Not sure if you knew that just making sure.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	you must mean overhead cam. the two have nothing in common.<br>  <br>  single cam operate all the lifters. dual overhaed cams may operate different cams to the same combustion chamber for cars that have multiple lifters. like some cars have 1 exhuast and intake lifter. but high preformance may have two to three intake/exhaust lifters. the multiple cams allow for optimal preformance.
dUN468v3aa	There's not actually much to describe. Generally a person decides to take a shortcut and either they make it or they don't.<br>  <br>  We've had one or two on our lines where a person has jumped down from one platform, crossed the tracks and failed to get up onto the opposite platform before they get "collected" (platforms in the UK are generally much higher than in the US or on the Continent). They tend to either get knocked flat or dragged along. I've one or two close calls of this type myself.<br>  <br>  In fact I have hit and killed someone jumping off a platform, though in this instance the person was committing suicide rather than attempting to take a short cut. I was passing through a station non-stop when this person rushed out from one side heading straight for the edge. I hit the horn and emergency brake at the same time but still went right over them at 40mph. Even at that modest speed the suicide was killed outright. When the Police arrived on the scene they had to ask if it was a man or a woman because they couldn't tell from what was left. It was a decidedly unpleasant experience and one that I'm hoping will not be repeated.<br>  <br>  In spite of this, it amazes me that people still take their lives in their hands by cutting across the tracks. There is absolutely no question that in a contest between a train and the human body the train will always win. If you are struck full-on at any great speed and your body will effectively explode. Go underneath and it's going to be like falling into a giant meat mincer. Whatever happens, you will be going home in a bucket. Trains can be on you in seconds with little or no warning. Even though I have been trained for safety on the lineside I am still very wary and nervous of train movements because I know precisely the cost of getting it wrong.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	Yes, I have.<br>  <br>  It is quite simple to describe:<br>  <br>  Gates come down, idiot ignores them, idiot lives or dies.

DEXSuqT7aa	SOHC means Single Over Head Cam --One camshaft controls the intake and exhaust valves.<br>  DOHC means Dual Over Head Cam--One camshaft controls the intake valves and one camshaft controls the exhaust valves.<br>  <br>  The valve cover(or top of the engine) should have DOHC if it is dual as they try to make this a selling point.  If it doesn't it is probably a SOHC or it will say SOHC on it.<br>  <br>  Also look for the manufactures sticker either on bottom of hood, or on frame above headlights, it should say engine size like(2.4L, or 1.8L, etc) and will say DOHC or SOHC along with emission info and belt routing.<br>  <br>  You can look up your vin also online, like at <a href="http://www.vehicleidentificationnumber.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vehicleidentificationnumber.c...</a> or some other site,  You have a digit in your vin that is for engine code, and that will tell you what engine is in that car.|`|pIEw1cnOaa	I agree with the first answer.

HAIAE3AZaa	Well if you are 22 and just getting your license. Your insurance will be high. Regardless of whether or not you are male or female it will be a high rate because you are just now getting your license. When I say hi, you may consider $100 per month to be low. To me, it was high. But I just turned 25 in December and my insurance has only been $57 per month where I am insured. And I think that is rather high considering my brother who is 24 is only paying $49 with the same insurance company and he has an SR-22 for no insurance violations. But where you live, what state, and which county play a role. It does not matter whether your vehicle is new or used. What matters is the type of vehicle i.e. sports car, sedan, mini-van, etc. And what type of coverage you need. Naturally Liability is cheaper, full coverage of course is far more. You an also reject the personal injury protection and uninsured, noninsured motorist coverage to make it a little cheaper if you are getting liability only. Fred Loya Insurance is who I go with. There is no down payment, and no fees, you just pay the monthly payment. You do have to pay your first month of course, but most insurance companies for example your insurance will be say $100 per month, but they want $175 down or something like that. Fred loya is not like that if you have a bank account or debit/credit card they can automatically draft the payment from each month. Hope this helps you.

aa9gieAIaa	ive never used lucas oil additives but making your oil too thick can starve the lifters of oil and cause problems. if your engine is really worn out you ought to rebuild/replace it if possible. if the ticking noise and such isn't too bad and it runs ok besides smoking you might replace just the exhaust seals. you can use an air compressor to hold the valves in place while you carefully pull the retainers, and just slide new seals in place one cylinder at a time. you might have loose guides too though which will take out the new seals faster. you will likely have to pull the cam shaft(s) or at least the rocker assembly. maybe the lucas stuff messed it up for you but i don't know. if your going to decarbon the combustion chambers you will need a lot more than one can of sea foam probably. its best to take the engine apart and clean it unfortunately i doubt its that bad though unless it really burn oil fast. good luck.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	the has no valve stem seals. there is the valve stem that closes against the heads.<br>  <br>  the reason it stops smoking after it warms up is the seals and gaskets expand allow less oil or antifreeze to be burnt in the engine.|`|SY9hPeROaa	Anything can be fixed . if you want to pay for it  is the car worth it|`|BFIW3qGYaa	Your valve guides are shot that would cause the smoke on start up oil dripping into the cylinder will it's not running the knocking would be a valve either a bent valve or a broken spring maybe?|`|DXZK6eMNaa	This stuff never heals.

voC2ffmzaa	Auto zone as the fuel pump for 100$.It may not be the fuel pump though.Before you spend a 100$ on a new fuel pump I would invest in a couple bottles of fuel injection cleaner. It is possible your injectors are just clogged up a little bit. I would take it to auto zone or near by Car parts store, Have them check your alternator,starter, battery and see if they cant check the fuel pump while they are at it. Sometimes check ups are free but depending on where you go it may cost you a little.I cant tell you how much longer your car will keep starting, I wouldnt risk it if I was you though.Yes its bad your putting extra strain on the motor.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It sounds more like a vacuum leak than a fuel pump. <br>  The fuel pressure can easily be checked and shouldn't cost that much.<br>  Do not spend the money on a fuel pump on a hunch - have the pressure checked.|`|aa9gieAIaa	that is likely the fuel pump with those symptoms but i would get the fuel pressure checked somewhere if you can. if its the pump you will need a new pump usually they are not worth repairing. if you know someone into cars you might look for a pump at a junkyard if thats the problem. it could be other things too. but its true that running low on gas murders the pump in most modern cars. ive gone through 2 in my car and bought used ones for 15$. no guarantee that way but i can't afford new ones which average 100-200$. good luck.|`|pIEw1cnOaa	to answer you questions, YES!  It is not good to drive a vehicle consistently on very little gas.  Your mechanic friend is right, the gas in the tank helps keep the pump cool.  To answer the how long question, lets just say that it needs to be done when you can get to it, preferably soon as possible.  i had a fuel pump go out on me on an interstate high way, and its not a good thing to have happen.  How much will it cost?  Well if you are going to take it to a repair shop, be prepared to spend a pretty penny.  Probably between 500-1000 dollars, depending on labor costs where you live.  They have to drop the gas tank in order to change the pump.  Being that the SUV is 14 years old, chances are they are going to have to put new gas tank straps and strap bolts under it as well.  But if say your mechanic friend can do it for very little and assuming he knows what he is doing then that would be your best option.  Instead of a 500-1000 dollar bill he may be able to do it for say $200.  But that is something to work out with him.  To keep revving the engine to get it to start is not good for the engine.  Today's engines are built with a lot of aluminum, and the stock aluminum parts don't hold up to that type of abuse very well.  So yes constantly revving the engine to run can and over time WILL damage the engine.  I hope this helps, I don't mean to scare you about the shops but they will definitely try to soak you if you let them.

DrMDxlWMaa	There are a number of replica car kits available on the market. Check the internet by clicking onto "replica Car Kits". You can replicate a car as long as you do not try to copy it completely or try to sell it as a manufacturers original product. I had a Fiberglas M.G.; 1952 and loved it. Another person liked it more than I did as he offered me a very good price for it and I sold it with intentions of buying and assembling another but,alas: I never did. I have built several 'dune buggies' from Volkswagen's and corvairs. You speak of car bodies without engines. I would find an old body of the model you want and coat it with 'resin release'. You can then replicate and assemble the 'parts' from fiberglass. Sounds like an interesting project and I realize this answer is somewhat vague but there is a lot of technical info on projects of this type available over the internet.

It more than likely could be a spark knock. A spark knock is kind of like a clanking noise and you hear it when accelerating or driving u a hill, basically when putting a load on the engine. A spark knock could be cause by a bad knock sensor, bad egr valve, or something of the sort. As far as the oil goes, I would drain some to bring it back down to full level, then consider getting an oil change very soon. I would reccomend using a synthetic oil and adding some Lucas oil stabalizer. The Lucas is to substitue 20% oil.

AXNkmdbKaa	Back in day of yore stupid racers were afraid of the 400 crank as it was cast iron and had little pin overlap.  So, the invented spacers so as to be able to use a steel 350 crank in the 400 block to get 377 cubic inches with the 4.125 bore.  Then they found out the block was the weak link, not the crank and began installing 400 cranks in 350 blocks to get the 383s.  This was easy and was abetted by all the left over 400 cranks from their building of the 377s.  Then they found out it didn't matter, both were fine for the applications they were suitable for.   So there you have it.  I remember people saying a 327 wouldn't run with a 283 because the stroke was so long it wouldn't rev.  Said the same about the 350 when it came out.  They used to take perfectly good 350s and install 283 cranks to get 302s because "they rev better".|`|WKcC0Qayaa	racing class limitations<br>  <br>  a destroked 400 would rev a bit higher, but would sacrifice the down low torque.  torque is far more important for the street.|`|3D5D6nB1aa	A 400 with a 350 crank,   the exact opposite of a 383- a 350 block with 400 crank.     Usually this is done to achieve  a quick/ high revving motor, great for artifcial aspiration such as turbocharging or supercharging.  For the weight, without boost, its not worth the effort, a 383 or a 400 alone will do the trick.

o4GgsqrBaa	I'm not the smartest person when it comes to auto repair. Last week I had an accident with my Ford Explorer and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the web for tips, but the procedures were way too complex for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations (auto insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me. Maybe you can try calling auto repair shops in Texas to see if they can help you. <a href="http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Texas-Auto-Repair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Tex...</a>|`|19QSiNqgaa	the " lawyer" is a fraud, this is a common scam, sending letters to people demanding cash. don't respond and take the letter to your local police station.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You bet they can come after you. The car may have been gone for 2 years, but your debt did not. Next they will obtain a judgment against you and garnishee your wages and possibly attach any assets you might have. The contract you signed when you bought the car gives them the power to do this.|`|TbiSBXclaa	You need to verify the letter first. But it is all very possible that the letter is legit and you owe the money.<br>  <br>  When the bank repossesses cars they sell them at the auction and any money that is still owed on the loan after the car is sold at the auction is the responsibility of the previous owner.<br>  <br>  So if you had a $25,000 loan on the car that got repossessed and they only got $14,000 for the car at the auction. You will be sued to repay the $11,000 balance of the loan.  They can garnish your wages if you don't pay.|`|DEXSuqT7aa	When a car is repossessed  the bank takes the car back. This you know.<br>  The bank then has a chance to resell the vehicle to make up for its loss.  Say you owed 20K on the car when repo'd, and the bank later sells it for only 15K. you are responsible for the leftover 5K the bank lost on your contract.  If they did sell it, legally you should have receivedved a letter stating the date of the auction, so you can be there to make sure it does sell and for the price.  I would contact the original lender and ask who to talk to about this matter. You need to make sure what they are asking for, and I would consult a lawyer on your behalf if you were not kept in the loop, just to see your viable options.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Yes, you should be worried. They want the rest of the money you agreed to pay. They sold it and the amount is the difference between what it sold for and what you owed when it was taken back. Get ready to pay up. They will find a way to get their money. "Wah hoo" is wrong. Please ignore their very bad advice.

xTioPxaVaa	Applying the lemon oil with the old strings on is a pretty good idea.  However, it's never as good as having the entire neck clear and doing it.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that you're doing your strings one at a time because you have a tremolo system on your guitar (and it's a major pain to start from scratch retuning those things).<br>  <br>  One thing I do is to block the tremolo in place.  Usually, a few guitar picks between the bridge and the body do the trick.  Then, you can remove all the strings and not have to start completely over when retuning.<br>  <br>  Remember, the only fingerboard that has to be oiled is rosewood.  With ebony, it's really optional (ebony is a very oily wood), and it's not recommended for maple.  Once or twice a year is all you should have to do this.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin ,TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	try using a q-tip to spread the oil under the strings.|`|gGBPPjLeaa	Yes pour a bunch of lemon oil on and then lick it all off, not sure because this is the car maintinence and repair section.

aa9gieAIaa	ive experimented with that for years and its not as simple as i wish it were. you can make a low pressure supercharger using a modified 12 volt vacuum cleaner for a car by butchering the pump casing. its hard to describe but you glue what ever baffles are needed in place to direct the outlet from the pump in to a small tube you put to the engine. i have not yet found a pre made pump suitable for supercharging yet though. its tricky to force air through the carb too because it tends to pressurize the float bowl and prevent fuel from coming in. you may need to pressurize the fuel tank. if your bike is two stroke you might be better off building an expansion pipe for it. its lots of work but can really wake up a 2 stroke more so if it has reed valves. ive given up on small engine super chargers mostly and turned to nitrous which works super. sorry i cant really help much more in this post, what your doing is different for every situation it just depends on what you have to work with. feel free to email me if there is more i can do to help, i might be able to show you pics of a supercharger from a vacuum. good luck.|`|3qenINMHaa	the parts alone would cost ten times what you paid for your toy,save your pennies and buy a bigger bike

aa9gieAIaa	you are going to have to look at a lot of other things before you decide what fuel system you want to use. im not sure if you have a specific project in mind or not. the things that affect quantity of fuel given to the engine are injector orifice size, injector open time vs close time, fuel pressure, and fuel viscosity. oh and # of injectors. 130 psi can be enough to make 10 hp or 1000 hp depending on all the other stuff. if you want to make 400 hp from a small 4 banger with a supercharger or something you will need high fuel pressures often with alcohol fuel. if you want to use gasoline which has less viscosity you wont need as much for good spraying. you wont need as much pressure with more injectors either depending. there are way too many variables for a simple answer in short.|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Fuel injector "size" (I'm assuming you mean flowrate) can be affected by fuel PRESSURE.  Raising fuel pressure will raise the flowrate of the injectors that you have.  Picking fuel injectors is a pretty specific thing, it would be easiest if you have specifications that you are going for.  for instance, at some point, your fuel injector and fuel pressure regulator will max out your fuel pump, in which case it will need replaced/upgraded or a multi system will be needed.  130 psi (of boost I'm assuming) would blow up any engine that I can think of.  130 psi of cylinder pressure would actually be really low.  Depending on the 4-cyl, to get 400hp you'd need close to 30psig (meaning as read on a boost gauge) with supporting modifications.  There are tons of variables.....|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	the injector manufacturers can give you that information on the size fuel pump you have.

fAcVndo7aa	In most places, the law states that a pedestrian in the crosswalk always has the right of way.  That may not be the law where you are, but it does hold true in most cases.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	It sounds like you weren't walking quick enough. How long was your light green? Did you get to the crosswalk when your light was green for sometime? Or did you start crossing right when your light turned green? It sounds like the car was stopped at a red light and traffic was clear and you were in the way, not that that's your fault. The driver probably got frustrated because he missed a chance to turn right. When a driver is stopped at a red light waiting to make a right turn, the driver is looking towards the direction of traffic (left) and sometimes they probably don't look to the right to make sure a pedestrian is not about to walk into the crosswalk before going, but they should. It's safer for pedestrians to cross after the light turns green and not after it's been green because cars have to stop because their light just turned red and usually when you're making a right turn on red on a busy highway, if your light just turned red, the other light turns green and someone turning right won't be able to turn right away until traffic that just got the green light goes first. <br>  <br>  So anyway, technically this probably wasn't your fault. Just because a driver gets angry doesn't mean you did something wrong. But I'll watch for those right turners before crossing just to be safe. If you see a driver with their right turn signal on, make sure he/she sees you before crossing.|`|6An9ZE6Maa	If the light directly across from you was green, then you should not have been walking across the street, unless there was a sign that told you to do so (little white man instead of orange hand.)<br>  <br>  If the light you were looking at was red, and you had a white man, the car was at fault. Right turn on red means you must stop at the intersection and look for cars turning or people walking across the street before proceeding.|`|AA11627842	I take it u mean the car was making a right on red and you had the green light to go across the crosswalk.If hes making a right on red.He still must stop first and make his right on red when its clear for him to do so. So if he did not yield to a pedestrian at then he was in the wrong for sure.<br>  In pennsylvania the law says pedestrians always have the right away first.But especially since he has a red light.He can only proceed after stopping , then yielding to all Traffic BEFORE PROCEEDING. That includes pedestrians.<br>  Still i never trust any stranger in a 2000 pound vehicle that could easily kill me.|`|mycM2GgUaa	If your light was green --<br>  <br>  The vehicle is REQUIRED BY LAW to remain behind the crosswalk until you are on the opposite curb; then and ONLY then may it proceed.<br>  <br>  Most people think that the vehicle has the right of way -- Nope.|`|xYMjXqhZaa	Lights are lights. Traffic, crosswalk, whatever.<br>  <br>          Most states have adopted the law that YOU MUST YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS IN THE CROSSWALK.<br>  <br>          Is that clear enough for everyone?|`|PLZfk1qDaa	he had a red light (assuming it was a 4 way intersection) you can always turn right on red<br>  <br>  so in theory you must yeild to him BUT when you turn right on red you MUST go into the right most lane whitch would therefore make it impossable for him to so much as cross your path<br>  <br>  so you shouldent have had to yeild to him but remember yeild is ment to be given, not taken (aka he is a jerk)|`|972baf556f8333310b3f4cc715ff243faa	There is a small poem that covers this situation:<br>  <br>  An epitaph on a gravestone:<br>  <br>  Here lies the body of Dan McShay<br>  He died defending his right of way.
9VzeSKyQaa	Well, first off, I would buy the SAME sub if you are going to get 2 of them. So you know they have the same power handling and the same amount of voice coils and the same amount of ohms. Different ohm settings on the speakers can harm the amp.<br>  <br>  Just go here:<a href="http://rockfordfosgate.com/rftech/woofer_wizard.asp?submitted=true&woofer_qty=1&woofer_imp=3" rel="nofollow">http://rockfordfosgate.com/rftech/woofer...</a>
BKDOZv7Caa	Well, if you are looking for a compressor that will run an impact wrench you are going to be hard pressed to find anything good in the $200-300 range.  Most impacts will burn somewhere between 5 and 6 CFM of air.  Thus, you need a compressor that will put out that much for continuous operation.  Most compressors in that price range won't put out that much, and most of them are direct drive oil less compressors.  I would stay away from them.  They are noisey, and don't seem to hold up well.  Belt drive compressors are much better, but they usually cost more.  Basicly a good entry level compressor for impacts and similar tools is a belt drive, at least a 25 gallon tank, 2 HP motor, and one that has a cast iron compressor or at least cast iron sleeves.  The least expensive example of a compressor like this I've found is a Husky at Home Depot for around $400.  Sometimes you can run into a good sale at Sears too, and used compressors are always an option.  Generally speaking, a good used belt drive compressor will run circles around a brand new direct drive unit.  Just make sure the tank has good integrity.  They like to rust if moisture is allowed to sit.   If you plan on using your compressor for multiple tools, cleaning etc they are very handy, but if all you're looking for is a power source for an impact, you would probably be better off going electric.  Air tools are nice, but hoses, fittings, compressors, and the actual impact can add up quickly.  You could buy a really nice electric for the same money.|`|aa9gieAIaa	if you are looking for something effective and reliable id pick any compressor with a oil filled piston pump. the dry pumps are ok but are loud and often inefficient. if you dont mean to take it places buy one with an electric motor. for 300$ your not going to get a very big compressor either way but id still recommend the oiled pump even if it costs more. compressed air is nice for mechanic work as it has a zillion uses, but electric impacts work good too.
cXFjei8baa	It's around 250 kts.  Really not an issue with tire max speed- it's the takeoff field length.  For a long flight, with full fuel, it takes longer to get to takeoff speed- a heavier airplane accelerates slower and must go faster to fly.  TOFL increases with airport altitude, so a route that can be flown starting from the low airport sometimes can't be flown from the high airport.<br>  <br>  Concorde couldn't fly that route either- it was a really short range airplane- barely trans-atlantic.|`|QsOBvOSvaa	I a retired 747 captain wit pacific routes : )|`|NaIa4AD0aa	I am not very sure but i would say because concorde is so much faster and 777 is a lot slower.

6mLhiSXuaa	What year/model is the car, and auto or manual transmission?<br>  <br>  I would check the 02 sensors and MAF. If either of those are shot (or on their way out), it could play a part in accleration and idle. They should be replaced at every tune up (spark plugs/coils, etc) but not many people do, due to the price.|`|iQGT4cUAaa	I just had a similar problem fixed. The car would lose power and sometime stall out at idle, and sometimes difficult to start.<br>  <br>  The problem was an Inlet Cam Sensor
XJclwaUCaa	It depends on how hard you want it to thump, a ported box THUMP harder with less POWER,  a seal box need more Power to make it thump.  Amps!   Get a 2 channel Amp Stereo, Not Mono For the rest of the Truck,  swap out the factory speaker, for after market speaker, And get a 4 channel Amp,  KICKERS is a pretty good amp,  And get those Kickers Tweeters They are a little hard to find, but if you find them they will make your truck sound good.|`|QZUPpUwvaa	In order to make really specific recommendations, it would be handy to know what type of budget you are working with and what you are expecting of the added sub(s). Also, it would be helpful to know something about the rest of your audio system. Do you have the original OEM stock radio, or have you added an aftermarket head unit?<br>  <br>  Generally, if you're looking to just add better low end to a stock radio, almost any single 10 or 12 inch subwoofer in a decent quality sealed box driven by a 200-300 watt amp will do that OK. A ported enclosure will be a little louder and more boomy.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to rattle the windows and wake up the neighborhood, and your budget can handle it, then multiple speakers, larger speakers, and higher powered amp(s) are the way to go.<br>  <br>  Most factory radios do not have low-level outputs. So you will need to install a line converter or buy an amp that has speaker-level inputs. My recommendation would be to install the line converter behind the radio and bring RCA's to the amp in either case. That way, you are tapping into the speaker wire behind the dash and bringing shielded wires to amp. Less likely to develop an electrical noise problem that way. Also, I would recommend a 2-channel bridgeable amp rather than the monoblock. It's cheaper and gives you more options for future expansion and or changes. Also consider an amp that has RCA outputs. That way, you can add another one with minimal wiring.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to decide if you need to conserve cargo space and whether you want a built-in look or if it's alright to have a big ugly box back there taking up space. If built-in is the answer, measure where you want it and either construct or have someone construct a box to fit. In such case, make sure that the box has the correct internal volume to support the sub you select. The Kicker's recommended above are great subwoofers, but need a lot of space to work good. for a sealed box, the MINIMUM recommended volume is .88 Cuft and the ideal is 2.0 Cuft. Go to a ported box and you need a minimum box volume of 1.75 Cuft with 3.25 being recommended. The port itself needs to be 22.5" in length, so that's a big box. A smaller 10" Kicker will work in a .66 Cuft sealed box.<br>  <br>  Most any mass marketed name-brand subwoofer such as the above Kickers, Rockford-Fosgate, Pioneer, Kenwood or Sony will give you a great improvement in bass. If you are looking for the absolute loudest possible, go with MTX Jackhammer. If you want the best quality sound at the highest possible price, go with JL Audio.|`|PLZfk1qDaa	10-12 inch kicker subs<br>  <br>  if you want powerful bass get 2, 600-800 watt each<br>  <br>  get a 600-1600 watt clss D mono amp<br>  <br>  and get a sealed box<br>  2-4 cubic feet<br>  with a 7 inch long 3.5 inch in diamiter port<br>  <br>  face the subs to the rear of your car as close to the back seat as you can get<br>  <br>  and remember dont get cheep wires, get the good stuff, you will apriciate its greater quality|`|VzBAzdfwaa	do you have an extended cab i would get a ported box and face the subs toward the roof, go with ficaraudio.com, dcsoundlab.com t3audio.com<br>  or ascendantaudio.com depends on how loud you want it they have 10inch subs all the way to 21inch subs. depends on what size subs you have then you know what cubic ft a box has to be and how much power you need. do you want loud bass or just medium bass
UYVlkvz0aa	Break first then change gears will ur still breaking|`|jtDKXWjkaa	i personally shift to neutral and coast while braking, and if i need to go again i just select the appropriate gear for the speed and go.|`|AA10760226	Change gears to match your speed, so you are not in, say, 3rd gear when the light changes and you need to go.

DEXSuqT7aa	Yes the clutch goes all the way in, if you don't your will cause premature damage to clutch and transmission.  If it is a rolling turn as light is still green or whatever, I usually just take it out of gear and coast around corner, then put in whatever gear is necessary for the speed I'm going, usually 2nd gear if in city.<br>  <br>  Only really go in first if starting from a stop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and stick with it, it can be challenging, but they are a lot more fun to drive in my opinion.|`|29d05TUGaa	if you get real good, you can speed shift without using the clutch. dont put the car in first after your up a few gears, let off the gas and downshift the same way you went up the gears just backwards. usually take corners in second, try not to shift going in corners, if the vehicle is low geared you can take safe corners in third.|`|10lqQPBkaa	clutch in all the way<br>  and if youre in residential roads second gear on the turns should do it, but if youre out of the residential places and stuf, you could get away with third. try not to change to first whilst moving, its not to good for the car.<br>  im a learner too :)|`|7EXXw5cEaa	lol yes you have to press in the clutch in ALL the way, you don't have to break when changing gears you just press in the clutch...change the gear....then let up slowly off the clutch and slowly on the gas.<br>  <br>  When your making turns you slow down...then change to a lower gear based on how fast your going. I would say if you make a turn at 1-10mph use first 10-20 use 2nd....i think<br>  <br>  Some cars have these stupid arrows that light up that tell you when to shift, I just listen to the sound of the engine.

The best thing to do is just spend a day getting familiar with the car.  a technique to use to get used to where the friction point on your clutch is (whe the gear catches) is to go on a flat surface, put it in first and engage the parking brake.  then using no gas SLOWLY let off the clutch until you hear the point where your engine bogs down then push the clutch back in to keep it from stalling.  do this several times until you get comfortable with that friction point.  that is also the point where you should give the car a little gas.  the hardest part is getting from stop to first so after you learn that you'll be fine.  it ultimately comes down to just sucking up your pride and going out there and drive.  so what if you stall just laugh off the people who blow their horn at you, chances are they dont even know how to drive stick...we all remember when we were just learning and understand.  so dont worry, you will be "stick-master" in no time.|`|aa9gieAIaa	everyone else is right you will improve if you want to and keep trying. you really have to keep at it its like training. make sure you have the seat adjusted properly so you have good leverage against the petal. when you come to a stop make sure the clutch petal is to the floor before you push it into first if its hard to do that. if taking off from stop is hard you really just have to give the engine enough rpm and practice until you get it. it is hard on clutches to slip them for long periods like that but you gotta experiment and just keep at it. im sure youll get it in time.|`|pIDN3GIjaa	It takes a bit of practice but after a while there is nothing to it.<br>  The key is to learn how to feather the gas and the clutch at the right time so it is smooth and coordinated with one another.<br>  This is especially important when starting out up an uphill street but with practice you should be able to hold the car in gear, with the clutch engaged just enough to hold the car steady without stalling or racing the engine.<br>   Find a spot to practice on level ground. Give it a bit of gas and find the spot in the clutch movement that starts to engage movement . Don't let the clutch out too fast, dont stomp on the gas to get it to move.<br>  You may stall a bit at first but just feel your way around it. This is important when you are in traffic and on a hill stopped. <br>  You have your foot on the clutch and one on the brake pedal. <br>  What to do? Let the clutch out just enough for it to start to catch . Then take your foot off the brake and on to the gas. Increase the gas while disengaging the clutch but you may have to keep the rpm up a bit more than on level ground to prevent a stall . With practice you wont need the brake at all.... just have the clutch out just enough to keep it from going forward and when you are ready you increase the engine speed and feel the clutch out slowly until you are moving . Switching gears while driving is real easy and forgiving , just watch how fast you are going before you downshift to a lower gear or your engine will race too high .<br>  The key is to relax, take your time and feel your your way around it. <br>  And always find a hill to practice where there is little or no traffic around. Good luck !<br>  p.s.  avoid using the hand brake for any situation. it is a bad habit and just complicates matters as it is just one more thing to deal with .|`|61lVbaayaa	i bought a manual car last year and learned how to drive it. The hardest part is not hitting the car behind you on a hill. when a car is really close behind me on a hill and i have no room for error going forward from a stop, I usually pull my hand break. I pull my hand break, put my car in 1st gear, take my foot off the break, and start applying the gas enough to feel my car go forward and i then i put the hand break down. I know it is a tad bad for the clutch and breaks but it beats hitting the car behind you.|`|WAQpKFlYaa	You will learn eventually learn. When your in first gear, let off the clutch very slowly, you will feel the car start  go foward, then just press the gas slowly and as your letting off clutch. Practice on the incline on you driveway to learn how to keep the car steady on a hill. you will get the hang of it though. Practice makes perfect! Good Luck!<br>  <br>  BTW, What was your dream car?
O3qsmr82aa	I would hold on to the Tundra unless you are always hauling heavy loads or trailers.  Diesel engines last longer because they have to be built so much stronger to withstand the super-high compression ratios.  They get better gas mileage too, but diesel fuel is more expensive to buy than gasoline.  That Toyota 4.7L V8 is a great motor!|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	The truck I want is an 2002 F-250 Crew cab with the 7.3 powerstroke. It has 82K miles on it. I heard that diesel engines last longer and get better gas mileage than regular engines.<br>  <br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  I know of people with the newer 6.0L diesel.<br>  <br>  Yes, that engine is a POS, but they still get 10 MPGs in them.  <br>  <br>  You can attribute that to Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel.  There is a trade off to now having the cleanest diesel fuel on the planet rather than the junk we once called diesel.  500PPM sulfur to 5 PPM!<br>  <br>  Unless you have a serious need to put an F-250 to work, don't bother.  The cost of operation isn't worth it.  The Tundra is made in Princeton, IN, anyway, so some American workers got to cash a paycheck and feed their families because of it as well.  I'm not sure when San Antonio, TX got the Tundra...|`|TwqpkWfZaa	honestly Toyota is a high quality vehicle, it will last as long as that ford will it is also 2 years newer and has less miles, Fords are nice ( i have a 2006 ford f150) but a Toyota will last a lot longer and have more value than fords as time goes on. I have a 95 Toyota 4 runner also with over 200,000 miles on it doesn't use any oil, knock, ping, nothing and have not had to replace anything on it. I also had a Toyota pick up (had to trade in for a family car 3 kids) got a corolla nice little car but no me so got this 4 runner. if you want power go ford but if you want reliable go Toyota. its a toss up own both like my husband and I if you can't decide ;)
XsZsk55Jaa	Yes you can.  The dealer will subtract the price of your car from the price of the new one and calculate the difference you have to pay.  He will pay off the balance on the old loan.   You will then get a new loan for the difference.  If you owe more than the old cars trade in value you may have to put additional cash down because you will need a loan for more than the price of the new car and it is difficult today to obtain financing on the new car if you owe more than it's worth.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Yes, but the payoff amount of the loan needs to be factored into the financial deal that you negotiate.<br>  <br>  The dealer will offer to buy the car from you in the form of a trade in allowance.  This allowance will be used to pay off your loan.  If the Trade In allowance doesn't cover the entire loan payoff you need to add that amount back into the price of the new car or dig into your pocket to pay the balance. <br>  <br>  Say you owe $5000 on your car and you want to trade it in.  The dealer offers to give you $4500 for the car.  You will then have to come up with $500 cash or add that $500 on to the price of the new car you are purchasing.  The good news is if the dealer offers you more than $5000 then you can use that extra cash for a down payment and reduce the amount of the new car loan.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Yes, but it doesn't put you in a very good position to negotiate.  The dealer will just roll the difference into the price of the new car.|`|AA12021409	You sure can.  When you go to the dealership, it helps your negotiating position if you know your current payoff.
v5FOqh80aa	I've always purchased an extended auto warranty for every vehicle I've owned in the last 7 years.

Yq2CUhtYaa	You are rearranging the facts.<br>  <br>  Your vehicle did not have to have a cat converter.<br>  <br>  However, your 1988 engine was an original emissions vehicle. And by law, you can not remove emissions equipment from an emissions vehicle or engine.<br>  <br>  So, since the 1988 originally had cats attached, it now needs cats.<br>  <br>  You would have been better off, leaving a 1970's engine in there.<br>  <br>  The DMV can say whatever they want. They're not the ones that make the emissions laws for your state.<br>  <br>  I live in GA, and I have to go to the GA Clean Air Force for all my questions, since the DMV has no idea what they're talking about.|`|hZHj0i52aa	Sounds like an abuse of power on the part of the inspector.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	do you have to get a emissions test? if you dont get a old cat cut it open and gut it. then re weld it and put it on. my brother in law did that on his dodge dakota because they didnt test only a visual inspection was needed. did you tell them that was not orignial engine?
x4zIhnneaa	TO THAT PERSON THAT SAID IT WOULD DERAIL THE TRAIN----c'mon  a train car, just 1 weighs about 100 tons!!!!   I've seen enough pictures of trains CUTTING PEOPLE IN HALF--yes it does happen!<br>  <br>  so no, putting a penny on the rails is harmless---just stand well out of the way.<br>  <br>  that other person that warned you about cutting your ankle---that is true so BE VERY CAREFUL|`|cbe8d33e7cbbe8c1c91e8ee76259d01faa	Most of the time it just flattens the penny... but good luck finding it again.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	Whether an adult is along or not, it is a bad idea for many reasons.<br>  <br>  As pointed out, you will likely be trespassing on railroad property to accomplish your task.  Bad reason number one.<br>  <br>  Trains are not the only danger involved with a walking trip on and around railroad right of way, but they are unforgiving, once you are on their turf...  for another reason.<br>  <br>  For number three, there are caustic substances, residue from maintenance of way procedures that will burn your skin if you come into contact with it.  It is easier than you think. <br>  <br>  There is much grease, oil, diesel and crater to ruin your shoes or cause a slip and fall and bash your head open.  If it knocks you out and a train comes... well, let us just say your mom won't be able to help you...  which I believe is reason number four.<br>  <br>  The rails themselves have "flash" on the inside at the top of the rail, as a rule, resulting from normal wear and tear, which appear as thin slivers of hardened steel, as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel.  If you brush up against it, it'll lay your ankle open to the bone and you won't even feel it or notice it, for a moment or two.  Then you'll look down to see why your shoes feel wet and you'll discover it's because they are soaked in your own blood.  So number five hurts really bad, will need extensive medical treatment and many, many, many more pennies.<br>  <br>  But if you want to just waste money safely, send your pennies and dollars to Washington, DC.  They REALLY know how to flatten money...|`|QFf9phAmaa	you will be caught by train police if you do so it is an offence|`|mycM2GgUaa	Incredible as it sounds, but something a prosaic as a penny has caused a derailment.<br>  <br>  In some locales, it is illegal.<br>  <br>  But if you do persist in this endeavor, try taping it to the tracks.  Yes, using duct tape would work.<br>  <br>  Personally, I did it when I was younger; the train was moving about 7 mph so I didn't have a problem finding it again [I still have it].

rQPMHX9maa	If your engine oil level goes down over time and you dont see oily patches under the car where you park, then you can almost be sure its burning oil and you dont always have to see smoke.  Some engines always burn oil, others hardly use a drop throughout a year.  Ask the dealer/service guys if your model is known to burn oil or not.  A 1999 motor is likely to be pretty worn by now and could be burning oil cos the piston rings are getting worn.  Most engines can clock up 100000 miles these days unless they have been thrashed.  Can be expensive to rebuild an engine and can be cheaper to watch oil level and top up whenever it needs.  Dont overfill engine with oil but always check level before a long run.|`|23f5faf99183332fc7a8dc101f94819baa	there could be a small leak around valve cover or other area that you would not see smoke if it isn't bad enough leak. watch engine oil level closely if it seems to go low sooner than usual that may be an indicator of a leak. also transmission could have a leak(trans do run hot) and you could be getting a smell from that without seeing smoke. try to get car in for a quick inspection they can detect a leak and determine if it is an immediate problem or can go for a bit longer.|`|TVITivPyaa	all engines burn some oil design that way if u smell oil check for leaks near exhaust manifold or valve cover u also could be mitaken oil smell for rubber ??? as long as oil is full dont sweat it girl
7DRl2iRDaa	I used to cut keys regularly and proof of ownership is required, bring along the VIN number as well, as it is used for cross-referencing purposes. Key codes were stored on microfiche a few years back and have been transferred over to computers now. <br>  <br>  An alternative, if you can remove the ignition switch, bring it in, the key code can be extracted from the ignition cylinder and a new key can be cut. <br>  <br>  As trivial as this may sound, seek out a Pontiac dealer that's been around awhile.

9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	Knock sensors retard ignition timing in the event of low octane fuel, advanced ignition timing or too much stress on the engine which will cause detonation. The VVT system works with oil pressure to advance valve timing in relation to engine speed usually over 3000rpm). If not working properly, it could advance valve timing when not required and cause misfires at low engine speeds. I doubt the knock sensor is at fault, start looking at the VVT system and wiring.|`|h0Zk7hfaaa	first of all your looking at the knock sensor.....rarely do those go bad, try  checking the condition of the spark plugs FIRST, before you start throwing money at parts.|`|TlXLKVEOaa	spark plugs or wires.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	mabey it's not the sensor, mabey you are missfiring.  the whole point of the sensor is to throw a code if something is out of spec in the engine, that doesn't mean the sensor is bad.|`|57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	VVT sensor may be going bad. what you need is a mechanic with a scanner to see into your cars computer to analyze what is going on. otherwise you will just be guessing and throwing parts $ at the problem.
8ifKojOXaa	I'd start with checking the fuse boxes for fuses related to the cruise control , one might be dirty or loose , so take it out clean the legs or pins with fine sandpaper or a wire brush and put it back in.Also there is a ground wire that goes to the cruise control servo unit under the hood , this ground wire could be faulty or have a bad connection , I'd simply run a brand new ground wire to it off the chassis or battery terminal , plus the problem could be in the steering wheel column wiring.<br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way the cruise control servo has steel lines coming off of it that run to the throttle body and that's how you know that's the servo unit.
rV1uAtt3aa	Yes, you can and should negotiate, especially with the market the way it is.  <br>  <br>  Only a very few cars are so in demand that you can't negotiate (usually sports cars with waiting lists.)<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go online and do some research.  For example, visit Cars.com and price out the vehicle you want.  They'll give you both the suggested retail of the car and the invoice price.  They'll also tell you about incentives that the manufacturers have on their cars.  <br>  <br>  As a rule, I usually offer to pay $200 over invoice and don't waste a lot of time.  I just ask that they show me the invoice before I sign the offer.  If you get a lot of pushback from the sales guy, leave.  Just say, "I'm going to another dealership; thanks for your time."  You'll find a guy who'll do $200 over invoice real fast.<br>  <br>  Don't just negotiate the price of the car, by the way.  You should shop the interest rate on the financing, or take advantage of an incentive for special financing.  Also, if you're trading in a car, you should negotiate what they offer you for that, too.<br>  <br>  There are lots of good articles on this on Cars.com.  Another great source is the annual Car Buying Guide issue of Consumer Reports.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  *** EDIT ***<br>   <br>  As others point out, you might be able to do better; even get a price "below invoice."  This is because dealerships print fake invoices, or pay less than invoice due to manufacturer incentives.  If you want to do better, you'll need to shop around and get two dealerships into a bidding war for your business.  As I said, do your homework because if you go in and they tell you $18,200 and you know a car's invoice is around $17,300, you can cut a lot of time off the process.<br>  <br>  Personally (and this is just me), I would rather pay more for a car then spend 8 hours dealing with car salesmen.  But that's me - if you save $700, that could be as much as $18 or $19 dollars a month on a 3 year loan.  And, if you pay cash, that's $700 bucks all at once.  That's a good return for 8 hours of work, but you might only save a few bucks; then it isn't such a great deal.|`|1hciyvKdaa	The most important thing you can do for yourself is take someone that has bought many cars in thier life, and let them do the talking, let somene whose done it before do it again, like your dad, uncle someone on top of the situtation.

They're dying to sell cars right now, you should be able to get several thousand off the sticker.<br>  <br>  Be willing to walk out without your car, remember you can get it at any dealer. You always get screwed when you want to walk out with it so bad you can taste it. Car salesmen have an extra sense that tells them if you're so in love with the car that you're not willing to walk away. In any type of negotiation you absolutely have to be willing to walk away, it puts you in the best possible position. <br>  I have even sat in the closer's office and used my cell to call other dealers and told them so and so dealer will give me this price on the car, what can they do? <br>  Good luck, you've got a long day in front of you they'll try to wear you down with exhaustion.|`|lUO6wLGAaa	Go ahead and try.  Remember, though, that car salesmen do this every single day.  You've never done it once.  They've heard every line there is, even if you think you're coming up with something original.  <br>  <br>  Given the state of the economy these days, it shouldn't be too hard to get a good deal.  They won't give the car away for free, nor should they be expected to, but you should be able to get a fair price.|`|RPoFBenJaa	Yes you can.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	Just to make sure I read it correctly, you wanted a 0.95 cubic foot enclosure per chamber and have a 1.14 cubic foot enclosure per chamber after sub displacement, correct?<br>  <br>  If that is the case then you will be fine with that little of difference.  One benefit of a sealed design is that they are very forgiving.  A 0.2 cubic foot difference is not going to make much of an impact and probably won't be noticeable in your case.  <br>  <br>  I made sure of this by using an enclosure designing program using the specs you listed.  The enclosures measured pretty much audibly identical like I first thought.  <br>  <br>  If you want to get rid of the extra 0.2 then you can always add bracing.  Just use some scrap pieces of MDF and make some small bracing on the inside.  Just don't add too much or you will end up with too small of an enclosure.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick some material in there I would recommend a dense material that is going to be audibly neutral.  Putting a low density material like stuffing/polyfill will do the opposite of what you want, like you mentioned.  A dense material would take up space and not make the enclosure appear larger to the sub.<br>  <br>  I would just leave it as is or add a little bit of bracing.  You won't have any problems with a slightly larger enclosure.  A larger sealed enclosure will actually slightly help your sound quality.  The downside is reduced power handling of your sub, but in this case that is neglegible.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|aa9gieAIaa	using slightly bigger boxes will mostly tend to shift your response curve a little lower. it should sound good still all in all and you can negate some of the volume behind the woofer by adding filler that is hard and dosen't resonate like sand or maybe glueing a block of wood inside it. that should help. ive seen people use sand before with success but you might want something lighter for a car if thats where it is.

Q4O1v13Qaa	Older cars used to have single-circuit brakes. The master cylinder had one fluid reservoir and one piston to build the hydraulic pressure to activate all 4 wheel cylinders. Dual-circuit systems have 2 separate reservoirs and 2 separate pistons built into the same master cylinder, so that if one goes out, you still have the other. Each circuit operates the brakes for 2 wheels. That's been mandatory on American cars for a little over 40 years now. Early versions were one circuit for the front, and one for the back. Most modern front wheel drive cars have dual-diagonal systems. One circuit each for 2 opposite corners.

b8cupXj7aa	Here is how you can figure out the lifting capacity of the helium in a spherical helium balloon:<br>  <br>     1. Determine the volume of the balloon.<br>        The volume of a sphere is 4/3 * pi * r3, where r is the radius of the balloon. So first determine the radius of the sphere (the radius is half the diameter). Cube the radius (multiply it by itself twice: r*r*r), multiply by 4/3 and then multiply by Pi. If you are measuring your balloon in feet, that gives you the volume of the balloon in cubic feet.<br>     2. One cubic foot of helium will lift about 28.2 grams, so multiply the volume of the balloon by 28.2.<br>     3. Divide by 448 -- the number of grams in a pound -- to determine the number of pounds it can lift. <br>  <br>  So, for example, a 20-foot balloon has a radius of 10 feet. 10* 10 * 10 * 3.14 * 4/3 = 4,186 cubic feet of volume. 4,186 cubic feet * 28.2 grams/cubic feet = 118,064 grams. 118,064 grams / 448 grams per pound = 263 pounds of lifting force. <br>  <br>  1 foot diameter balloon <br>  volume =0.5 cubic feet<br>  lifting  capacity = 14 grams<br>  <br>  12 foot diameter balloon<br>  volume = 904 cubic feet<br>  lifting capacity = 57 pounds<br>  <br>  24 foot diameter balloon<br>  volume = 7238 cubic feet<br>  lifting capacity = 455 pounds

28b2219e5d0c8247f6952f951c0a458eaa	It sounds as if  your throttle position sensor is faulty, and possibly your  oxygen sensor too.|`|AA12261615	it sounds like to me that the gas filter may be stopped up on it or the fuel pump might be going out,gm had  a few problems with some of the pumps they used from 98 up to 02,it was a defect in some of them and this is how they would act,and then again yours may just be going out from being used so much,you can also have a bad sensor on it ,and that will cause it,but before you go and spend a lot of money on parts take it by any auto zone and have than scan it,its free,and this may tell you which one if any are bad,there are several on that can that could cause this to happen,timing can also be an issue with it,but have it checked just to be sure,good luck hope this helps.|`|ad353075d9916996716332b75b4c45a2aa	Its Because its a Chevy|`|xiSbEofLaa	i have a 3.8 in my camaro, think about the kinda of gas u use, when was last oil change, spark pugs and wires change, miles and over all wear of motor....

czZX0xBkaa	en primer lugar, si le falta freon es porque trae alguna fuga en una manguera , conección, evaporador ó condensador, el gas freon no se gasta ni se consume, definitivamente trae fuga, en cuanto a la falta de voltaje o electricidad en el compresor, esto es exactamente por lo mismo, los autos vienen equipados con un bulbo o sensor que cuando le falta freon o definitivamente no trae, evita que le llegue corriente al compresor para que este no funcione y se pueda da?ar por la falta de freon, ya que junto con el freon, circula aceite, si el compresor lo hechas a andar sin gas freon y por consiguiente sin aceite, este se va a amarrar y se va a romper por dentro.<br>    que te le revisen fugas, las corrijan, lo carguen de freon y verás que vuelve a tener corriente en el compresor|`|Yk2KA9RWaa	si lo q dice sherk es la verdad tal cual.  suerte

XgYrqq5taa	Muchos autos viene asi por seguridad, y que sea imposible olvidarse de prender las luces (sobre todo al entrar a un tunel). Si no te gusta tienes que buscar el cable que alimenta el relay de luces (o el que alimenta el fusible de las luces) y ponerle un interuptor para poderlas apagar cuando quieras. Pero hay que tener cuidado porque es posible que no funcione luego el claxon de luces.(el cual es un elemento de seguridad). Ahora si quieres prenderlas tambien de dia, entonces ademas del interruptor hay que tapar los sensores de luz, para que crea que siempre esta de noche.|`|WHK5KvUCaa	SEGURAMENTE ABAJO DE LA PALANCA DE DONDE ACCIONAS LAS LUCES MANUALES, ESTA UNA RUEDA, CHECA SI PUEDES GIRARLA HACIA LA DERECHA O HACIA LA IZQUIERDA, DE SER ASI, GIRALA HASTA EL TOPE HACIA LA IZQUIERDA!!
