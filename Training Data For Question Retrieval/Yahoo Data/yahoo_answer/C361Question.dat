20090202170305AAr5kS8	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Realtor showed up after canceling.  Should I be mad?	My home is currently on the market.  My realtor's secretary called at 4:40 to set up an appointment to show my home with another real estate office(my house can be shown by other offices) this evening between 5:30 and 6:30.  We have a standing request of 2 hours notice so I set an appointment for 6:30.  The secretary said she would check with clients and call back.  After about 30 mins. the secretary calls back and says appointment has canceled.  Okay no big deal.  Yippee, my house is clean anyway!  At 6:10 i hear someone unlocking and coming through my front door!  Yep, it was the realtor.  Scared the sh*t out of me!  Do i have a right to be angry?  How would you handle this with your realtor so that it doesn't happen again in the future?   By the way, I left and let them go ahead and show the house.

20090202180415AA2Ffcb	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Ok guys, give me your suggestion on this part-time business (I'll tell you about it below)...?	I live in a city that does not pick up limbs or bushes unless they are cut up in sections 3' long or less and tightly bundled in bundles weighing less than 35 lbs.  These limbs/bushes come from yearly pruning, blown down because of storms, etc....it's just a real pain to do it the way the city wants.   I'm thinking about buying a wood chipper and advertising and doing this for them.  Putting the chipper on a trailer and chipping the limbs into heavy duty trash bags that they can use as mulch or just set out by the curb for the city to pick up with their bi-weekly trash, or I could just haul the chips off for them.   How well do you think would go over?  Do you think I could make a decent part time income?  Lets say if you had a truck load of brush...how much would you be will to pay for someone to take care of them for you?

20090202181410AAJ0eqj	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Ttansfering propane from a small tank to a large one?	ok, here is the deal.. i have only been in my current state for a little over 4 months,, i have never before used propane (i come from the city and i am now living in the middle of hicks-ville) Anyway, when i first moved in i had almost a full tank of propane (that was sept.) in nov. i had it filled half way but because it was a sunday the delivery driver wouldn't let me pay him (i tried) the bill came and it was around $400 for the half tank that he put in (very expensive if u ask me but i have no prior propane experience. Well, it was like 2 weeks before x-mas, i have a 7 year old, and i lost my job (temp and it ended) and i couldnt find a job ANYWHERE, i sent my resume to literally 30 jobs per day and i have a business degree BUT like i said, i literally live in the middle of friggin nowhere (there is not one job in this or surrounding towns and i am not exaggerating!) the closest places that have work are Raleigh and Durham which are almost an hour and a half,, which is tough because i have to put my son on the bus in the morning and get to night school by 6 (almost impossible) BUT i am desperate and will take anything  but almost every job that calls me back or interviews me tells me that my resume is great BUT that the commute is too great and they are scared that they will train me and i will leave because i am burned out and sick of the drive :-(  ok most of that wasnt really relevant but i had to vent! ok so i went to pay the bill and i was told that my landlords wife called thema nd told them that no one was allowed to porder propane for my house except her! so i told the propane company that there was no way in hell that i was paying them without a guarantee that i could get more fuel! Also i tried to get an account with them and they said i wasnt allowed that it HAD to be in my landlords name ?? wierd,, So i left and called my landlord and i told him and he said that he would fix it apparently the bill for my house and his were on the same account so he told me to just pay him and that i would be allowed to order so i called the propane company again and they said that he called and told them i could order BUT his wife said that it had to be COD! now again i was screwed because i could only afford the 400 bill NOT 400 PLUS a couple of more hundred that would have lasted a few weeks at best,,, Oh, and did i mention this house is an old farm house that has like NO insulation and cracks betweek the door frame that make it virtually impossible to keep warm? YIP it is so drafty in here that most of the time it is warmer outside and the only souse of heat is one of those old fashioned big block looking heaters wuth the pipe coming out that is in a remote corner of the house!! ok venting again, sorry.. SO i go to social services and they wound up giving me like 500 dollars worth the propane (80%) that was right before x-mas but the tank is mt again and now i have a dilemma.. i have been paying my landlord for the propane bill (not all of it yet but maybe 200) and yesterday i get a call from the propane company saying that they want money from me for the old bill!!!   wtf! i begged them for an account and was told NO, then i pay my LL and now they are saying that i still owe the bill.. i have no propane left, it is cold in my house, my LL isnt home, and other propane companies are saying that is illegal for them to fill the tank if it belongs to another company, but the tank is so old that i cant read anything on it,, also, if the LL owns it then they have to say it is ok to have it filled,, even if i pay up front.. what do i do now? i already paid the LL more than half but obviously he didnt pay the gad company and how can i be responsible for a bill when i was adamently denied an account?? so i was thinking...i need propane my dad is in town and he is smart and mechanical.. is it possible to buy some small propane tanks and transfer the propane from them into my big tank? i know it is more expensive that way, but if you think about it, repaying 400 plus getting a delivery that i have to pay cod for it and that will be like 700,, which i cant afford because of what i mentioned above plus my LL isnt going to pay me back , i know he wont,, he came complaining to me a few weeks ago that he got laid off and he is old so no one will hire him. i want to move so bad because i need to work not only for financial reasons but also if i dont soon i will go NUTS from cabin fever!! but even if i get a new place today it is unreasonable that i will be moved in in less than a week and i dont want to freeze so if i can get just enough propane to last a week or so i will be happy and i will tell my LL to keep my security deposit to pay the rest of the bill and for a new screen (my cat ripped) i dont mind taking a loss because it will literally cost me less to move than to pay the bill... does anyone know how to transfer propane> please dont say it is dangerous or illegal,, I KNOW THAT! i am just asking if it is possible

I had a 10 year old Garbage Disposal that started to get bad.. It would clog up and when I would run the dishwasher and the garbage disposal  was clogged, the dishes wouldn't get 100% clean.       The day after this past Christmas, my garbage disposal died and stopped working, it started to smell burt.         I bought a new one a little over a month ago. It worked great and I never had a problem with the dishwasher, everything always came out clean.      BUT, a week ago I had the garbage disposal on and the water was running, I then heard these really big thumping sounds. I hadn't put anything down it. I didn't see anything in the garbage disposal. When I heard those sounds, I didn't have anything else on.      Since then, my dishwasher doesn't clean at all, almost every glass has stuff in it. I have washed, rinsed, done everything.. I REALLY don't think the problem is the dishwasher. It's three years old and only really does this when something is wrong with the garbage disposal.      I had the SAME company that put the garbage disposal in come back, but they of course did not put the blame on the garbage disposal and even snaked out the line.       Still, I had to pay them $124 and it wasn't fixed at all. I ran a load of dishes and they were still dirty when finished..      What could it be?

20090202185320AAJ0tqW	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Will pinning a sweater in shape after hand washing leave permanent holes?	I have some wool and cashmere sweaters that I have been hand-washing in cold water, as the care directions say to do. The directions then say "reshape and dry flat."      I have a flat drying rack that i use to dry the sweaters. But I find that the sweaters tend to contract/shrink a bit, especially around the collar, when they are wet. So I stretch them out gently when drying them, and I was using cans and jars to "block" them out and keep the shape while drying.      But it occured to me that I could use pins (safety pins, embroidery pins) to pin the sweaters directly to the drying rack, and keep them in the right shape more effectively that way as they dry.      My question is: is it safe to pin the sweater in position when drying, after every wash? Or will doing this repeatedly leave permanent holes in the sweater, and ruin it?

And throughout the time that I am using it, every time the flame restarts it keeps booming and scares the crap out of me! I have never had a gas oven, so I don't know what to do. Should I call the landlord? Is this fixable?    (I want to keep my eyebrows!)

20090202185601AA8JkC6	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What tree is this and what can I do to try to recreate the living design?	I recently came upon a set of images that I want to recreate in my own garden. From what I can gather, it seems a bamboo frame was constructed and various tree growths were guided around it.       http://bp2.blogger.com/_POt0U4XC_N4/RlxB...        http://bp3.blogger.com/_POt0U4XC_N4/RlxB...        http://bp0.blogger.com/_POt0U4XC_N4/RlxB...          Well, actually, I don't want to recreate it exactly, I want to come up with my own design based on what I see here. But I don't know exactly what kind of tree it is. I think it's elm, but I am unsure, and if it is, what kind of elm? I also don't know how many I would need to plant, and how fast it grows.      Since I found it in a Blog, I have no idea who made it, where it is, or what methods went into it.      I have done quite a bit of research on tree shaping, pooktre, aborsculture, and most sources seem very vague. Some say Elm is best, without going into any detail about why and what kind is best.      Any information that would help me learn how this is done so I could recreate it would be much appreciated.

20090202185807AApI3D6	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Will burning wood over a gas pipe in our fireplace be dangerous?	We are not at all intellectual on the fireplace situation, so we don't know if this gas pipe in the fireplace can be used with wood or if we need a gas log.  we would prefer to use wood but is it even worth it?  We read somewhere that using the wood doesn't heat the home cause the heat just goes right up the flue.  But wouldn't this be the same for even a gas log? so... just need a couple answers.  Also, is it cheaper to run the "GAS" in the fireplace than it is to run our heat bill up?
20090202190041AAJ0wMJ	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Electrical Outlet Issue?	I have several electrical outlets that have stopped working in one side of a room, and a few outside near the room. I assumed a breaker was triggered, but nothing. I reset all the breakers; nothing. I read about GFCIs, so I reset everyone I could find. The strange thing is, when my wife first told me about the outlet not working, I tested it with a lamp and it worked - a few minutes later I tested the same outlet again and it stop working, and now none of them work. Any ideas? Thanks!
20090202190634AAXRLFl	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Sewage/rotten egg smell in house?	We just bought our house on Jan 22nd, it had been empty 4 weeks before we moved in, we had an inspection and the inspector said everything was "fine". Well when we went to use the bathroom nothing would go down, and stuff would come back up into the tub, we had a plumber come out and said we had roots in our drain and he removed them, the toilets worked fine that day, next morning we woke up to get a shower and it wouldnt drain and neither would the toilet. So the plumber came back out and said the mainline was blocked this time. Well yesterday and today we have been smelling an awful smell like sewage or rotten eggs, its not all the time it comes and goes. What would be causing this? Is there anything I can do to get rid of it besides calling a plumber AGAIN, i lived in this house 12 days and have the plumbers here twice already, I just want to be able to enjoy my first home..any suggestions or hekp would be greatly appreciated

20090202191647AAOaDBb	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Need info on air conditioning?	My Husband and I are renting a small two bedroom apartment that has central heat and air. The heat is working just fine. But the air is not. It is coming on just fine, but no cold air is blowing out. When we cook, the heat of the kitchen makes our entire apartment hot. Also if I am working around the house doing chores, I sometimes get hot...this is all due to a medical condition. So yes, we need our AC in the winter. So we called the apartment managers and they were to send a tech out to look at it. We waited at home all day, no tech. The apartment management made no effort to contact us. So my Husband went to the office to see what was going on and he was advised that the tech had an emergency and had to go to the hospital. OK, understood. But we had a problem with our toilet and needed it attended to for the third time since we've lived here (since Aug of last year)... So they sent someone to fix that. They said they'd get to the AC later...      So today, a half week later, they call to follow up on the toilet problem to make sure it was fixed. My Husband mentions the AC and they inform us that nothing can be done until it gets warmer out. Well here we are in February, and I am not about to wait another month or two before the AC is fixed. They said it cannot be fixed until it is warmer. Is this true? Can ACs not be fixed, except for warm weather? The problem is that I sometimes get so hot, I feel like I am suffocating sometimes...and if I get really hot I get nauseous and sometimes worse. If they do not fix the AC, would we be able to get out of the lease to move to someplace that can provide me with some relief? I don't think it is right for them to expect us to honor our lease when the AC is not working, and they have no intention of fixing it.

There is a water leak from the pressure value.  I have tried opening it a few times to release water but it keeps leaking.  My gas heater is I think 16 years ago (I've only live in the house almost 8 years so not sure if it was replaced before).  Its driving me nuts with the dripping coming from the pipe.  I assume most will tell me to replace the whole heater but I was hoping to wait until the summer to do this.
