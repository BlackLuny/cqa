XLXncQu9aa	I think the Dolphins will pick up where they left off.  The Dolphins used that wild cat offense effectively this past season, and Sporano really turned that franchise around with his unique coaching style.  Also it was great how they added Chad Pennington who isn't a bad QB.  I think he was part of the reason for their success.  Also their strong running game helped their struggling offense to score points.  I think they will continue winning next year as long as they keep their players they have and possibly draft some in needed positions like WR.  <br>  <br>  The Buccaneers did not do themselves any favors by getting rid of Jeff Garcia.  Sure he wasn't an all star QB but them releasing him was a bad idea.  The QB position is the most essential part of the game.  Now they will have question marks at the QB position unless they can work with Brian Griese and that isn't 100% proof.  Their defense will probably do well because they have a lot of talent.  The problem with that team is that they need to get their offense going.  They need better WR's, and the RB position is still lacking.  If they can't answer the questions on offense then they won't be better than 7-9 next year, also taking into account that the NFC south is a tough division. <br>  <br>  I think the Jaguars will bounce back.  They need to get better players on offense if they are going to compete.  Del Rio may be fired if he doesn't make the playoffs next year.  They were one of the most disappointing teams this past year.  Releasing Fred Taylor also didn't help, because now you only have Jones Drew and if he goes down, who can you count on?  I think they should draft WR's, and get their defensive line taken care of.  Their defense has aged and they need some young talent especially in the secondary positions like CB and SS.  If they can get their aging defense fixed, and get better players on offense they should be back to their winning ways.|`|6UHMxWKBaa	Dolphins i think will finish 3rd next season<br>  Bucs are not lookin good <br>  Jags i think will be above average next season|`|Zp65xPQyaa	I believe the dolphins will be the only ones to have a good season next year. Reason for that is Bill Parcells is a genius when it comes to restoring franchises. The bucs just got rid of their coach and I don't think that was the right call. The new staff will probably not make the smoothest transition into the NFL considering John Gruden could not develop a franchise QB so there isn't one on the Bucs current roster. The Jags may have the O-line back now and have the better chance of doing something next year. It all depends on if they answer the 3 biggest questions in the draft or free agency this year (OL, WR, and DB) I would like to see them get a guy like TJ Houshmandzadeh or Marvin Harrison and then draft one of the top 3 tackles in the first round and pick up a good DB like Smith from Wake Forest in the second round. If they can answer those 3 questions with mid level players this offseason then they stand a good chance of having a good team.|`|k8i4eKlkaa	I think the Dolphins will have a great year nexy year with Chad leading the charge. On the other hand Bucs are prob spliting with Jeff Gracia so it depends on who is there QB. Maybe a high draft pick you never know. I dont evan want to talk about the jags with them losing Fred they will be lucky if they can get 6 wins.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	I say the dolphins will battle with my patriots again|`|GrmKIDA7aa	Dolphins - 11 - 5<br>  Bucs - 10 - 6<br>  Jags - 7 - 9

sZj8uzdFaa	I'd say probably the Cavs or Lakers. They have the most versatility. Lebron is by far the most unstoppable player in that game. You also have Gibson and Mo Williams who can shoot the 3. Ben Wallace is a good defender and will get rebounds (I think he's a little overrated in the game, but who cares? Take advantage of that) Ilgauskas is decent as well. So you have a lot of different options to go. You can drive to the basket a lot with Lebron, shoot 3's with Gibson and Williams or get the ball down low to Ilgauskas.|`|5FypDafWaa	Celtics|`|GxEqbRslaa	Celtics|`|vzH7f7V5aa	The Cavs.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Lakers<br>  <br>  <br>  Celtics<br>  <br>  either<br>  <br>  one|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	celtics, (even though i hate boston!)

You're a bit short, way to light, with marginal to below average stats.  Maybe junior college at best.|`|5d6rp9T3aa	Seems you are a little faster than him. Its up to the coach on who should be the starter. As a sophomore the odds of starting are slim.<br>  One reason is experience, junior high ball is a lot different than high school ball. The speed of the game is a lot faster. Guys are 2-3 years older, faster, and stronger. I was a starter in JH also and when I moved to HS I never saw the field until my Junior year. Then I went on to make the All-district team, All-area team, All-star team, and Honorable mention for All-state. Keep working hard in the weight room and on the field and you will succeed. As for D1 that all depends on your work on the field and in the classroom. If you don't go to college you can always find a Semi-pro team in your area.|`|8eaNfLEOaa	As a Sophmore, I would worry more about improving your skills over anything.<br>  People don't really recruit you until your junior year, so I wouldn't worry about being second wing.<br>  Besides, a lot of coaches give seniority to the older guys.<br>  Wing is a position that depends a lot on strength too, and since he is a little tougher, I wouldn't be surprised if they give him the edge.<br>  Don't be upset though;  this is worst case scenario.<br>  If you can grow, which you will, throughout the year, you might be able to take over the lead spot or a platoon.<br>  <br>  But with him graduating next year, you probably have a decent shot at D1 ball.  It's tough for me to say, but if you are a key piece to your team's playoff run, you can definitely get recruited.  My high school went to a state championship (5-A) and lost.  They had about a dozen guys who are going from USC to local ball, all on scholarships.  If you can be one of those guys, you have a future.

There have been many players paralyzed during games, and many that have received career ending neck/spinal injuries.<br>  <br>  Most of the deaths in football occur at the high school level. The primary causes of death is heat stroke and other indirect causes, but nearly half die from injuries inflicted on the field.<br>  <br>  i.e. "In 2002, five of 15 football deaths occurred because of on-field head injuries. Three were high school players, one was a youth league player and one was a semi-pro player.

It should be noted that the number of high school football players is far greater (more than 1 million) than the number of either college (approximately 75,000) or professional (approximately 2000) players. The most frequent on-field activity involved when players sustained their fatal injuries was either tackling or being tackled (35%). "<br>  <br>  "Five deaths were in high schools - three in Texas, one in Michigan, one in New Jersey. A college freshman player in Michigan and a 10-year-old girl playing football with boys in Illinois also died in the same period.<br>  <br>  Last year [2001] there were 23 deaths among the 1.8 million football players in the country - 1.5 million on high school, junior high school and non-federation school teams.

They fight all the top competition, not UFC just washouts, and they don't duck fights because all the sudden the number one contender is his BFF.|`|d53eb480285c0502d45e38b33b8b27cfaa	I would say that he is the fighter of the decade.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	rickson gracie by armbar|`|z8cQwTx1aa	there are quite alot of fighters for him to beat gonzaga, couture, lesnar, and mir so till he fights ALL of the best i dont think he can truely call himself the best.|`|FPuFDrZDaa	sorry- but NO. This is prob. not gonna be a popular opinion; but hey- sometimes the truth hurts. Fedor is a GREAT fighter- PROBABLY the best Hvywt. (but not p4p) in the world today. Unfortunately, I can only say Probably the greatest, cuz Fedor refuses to sign an exclusive deal with the ufc to prove that he's as great as his promoters say he is. I can't speak for everybody- but when I was growing up- they called that "ducking the competition". Again- with all due respect to Fedor- he is NOT PROVEN to be the best p4p fighter in the world. Only 1 "p4p" fighter has accepted a challenge from, and beaten another top p4p fighter in the past year- and that is George St. Pierre. GSP (somehow still ranked at #3 by yahoo's bcs-like rankings) accepted the challenge of, and not only beat, but Dominated BJ Penn (still considered the best LtWt. in the world, and somehow still considered #4 p4p), beating him so badly that BJ literally QUIT after 4 rds. with gsp. Again- no offense to Fedor or Anderson Silva- but who have they beaten to DESERVE the #1 spot? Silva did beat Dan Henderson (impressively) to unify the Pride and UFC MdlWt. titles- so that's something; but even that was almost a year ago now. Since then Silva has fought James Irvin and Patrick Cote- neither of which are considered as top 10 fighters even in their own divisions. But to Silva's credit- he's literally BEGGING the ufc for competition... hopefully they'll give it to him sooner than later. So I can at least understand some people voting for Silva. But Fedor has literally done NOTHING impressive to earn the #1 spot. Again- no disrespect- he's an animal in the ring/cage, etc., and is genuinely one of the classiest pro athletes I've ever seen; and I respect the heck out of him for that. And Yes- he holds 2 consecutive victories over "former ufc champion"s; but the key word there is Former. Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovsky were both well past their prime, and not on anyone's top anything lists by the time they got in there with Fedor. so anything but a dominating victory should hurt fedor's ranking, not help it. And again- sorry if the truth hurts here- but Fedor was actually losing to Arlovsky by the judges' scorecards before Arlovsky inexplicably abandoned his winning startegy to throw a ridiculous flying knee, taking a stupid risk against a superior fighter and athlete; and of course, Fedor caught him. So- dominating victories for Fedor- definitely! But impressive... NO. Impressive would be if he could dominate a CURRENT ufc champ in his prime, like Mir or even Lesnar (who's prob. not even in his mma prime yet, and would prob. still give Fedor a better challenge than Sylvia or Arlovsky). There's an old saying: to be the best, u've gotta beat the best. In other words, u can say how great u are until ur blue in the face; but it means nothing until u PROVE it against top level competition; and that's exactly what Fedor refuses to do. Did Michael Jordan ever walk around saying he was the greatest basketball player in the history of the game, yet refuse to play in the nba cuz he could make more money in europe; or refuse to play in the olympics cuz they didn't pay him for that? What if Brett Favre was the greatest QB in the history of the canadian football league, yet refused to play in the nfl... would he still be considered one of, if not THE best QB of all time? Absolutely Not; and everyone would think it was ridiculous, and call u names if said otherwise... so how is the Fedor situation any diff.? This is exactly why the bcs in college football doesn't work. How can a team be #1 just cuz a bunch of "panelists" say so? How can 2 teams be undefeated at the end of the season, and one is simply given the championship? The whole ideology is stupid; and p4p rankings are exactly the same- a bunch of so-called journalists, who have little to no more business covering the sport than any average fan... decide who ranks where... and that makes sense why?! On the other hand- common sense says: George St. Pierre is the best p4p fighter in the world right now; not just cuz he's in the ufc, and beat another ufc champ; but because he stepped up to the challenge and Proved himself against another top p4p guy. When and IF big fish Fedor ever decides to jump out of the small pond and into the ocean, maybe we'll finally get to see him prove himself. But until then- he'll always be "The Last Emperor" of mma's minor leagues... period.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	I honestly do not think he is the best. Him and Anderson Silva seems like they haven't been challenged. But he maybe the best fighter in his weight class right now, in his leagues, but he has not fought Couture, Lesnar, Mir. <br>  <br>  Also GSP, Evens,Penn are prob better then him but they are different weight classes.

Tony Graduated with a 3.0 GPA out of Burlington HS (good not great)<br>  2. Tony went to Eastern Illinois (not exactly the choice of scholars)<br>  3. Tony Scored a 37 on his Wonderlic Test (average is 24)<br>  4.

In fact, 2 QB's (Leftwich & Grossman) from the 2003 draft class who scored FAR below Romo have Super Bowl appearances and Leftwich has a RING (maybe not of his own doing, but he still has one). <br>  <br>  These guys scored HIGH and where are they? Alex Smith scored a 40 and is currently stinking up SF, Ryan Fitzpatrick scored a 38 and has sat the bench most of his career, Charlie Frye score a 38 and where is he?, Craig Krenzel scored 38, JT O'Sullivan anyone? Joey Harrington? Jason Maas (43)? <br>  <br>  On the OTHER end of the spectrum, we have Donovan McNabb who only scored a 14 on his Wonderlic and has appeared in numerous NFC Championship games and 1 Super Bowl, Trent Dilfer scored a 22 and won a Super Bowl, Terry Bradshaw only scored a 15 (Lord of the Rings, need I say more?), The Legendary Brett Favre only scored a 20, Ben Roethlisberger only scored a 25 and won 2 Super Bowls...|`|JpvXhgmraa	Yes, he sure knows how to blow games, and sure can get the football to players on the opposite team.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I don't know about the smartest QB, but he is smarter than Jessica Simpson, well I hope he is.|`|ndopqX6Taa	I guess that is why he had to start dating Jessica.

I also don't believe Boozer will be back nor do they need him back with Millsap's jump.|`|13XU8cCKaa	I think Harris will win most improved player of the year.  Because<br>  1.)  Danny Granger-  Everyone expected him to be the way he is playing and showed some improvement but not that much as he was playing all star level last year since O'Neal was injured the entire season.<br>  2.)  Paul Milsap-  He is another strong candidate for most improved player.  We didn't expec him to play this level so I think he would finish 3rd.<br>  3.)  Devin Harris-  I think will be potential winner becuase he is second in command for the Nets.  Vince is still the go to guy.  He improved every part of his game and became an all star.<br>  4.)  Chris Duhon-  Duhon has become the leader of the Knicks at PG and is the reason along with David Lee's play that the Knicks are still in the playoff race.<br>  5.)  Andrea Bargnani-  His play has improved drastically since O'Neal got injured.  He even had O'Neal go to the bench with his play.  With O'Neal gone he can only improve more.  You know what I change my mind this guy should win.<br>  This is how it should pan out.<br>  Rookie of the Year-  Andrea Bargnani<br>  Runner Up-  Devin Harris<br>  3rd Place-  Paul Milsap<br>  4th Place-  Danny Granger<br>  5th Place-  Chris Duhon|`|2VVgxFDKaa	yes thats true but Devin Harris and Danny Granger both went from pretty good players, to All Star caliber players.  Paul Milsap had some really good games like 5 or 6 in a row where he was putting up huge numbers, but like a few games before the all star break he started to slump pretty bad and he isnt that consistent as Harris and Granger are|`|QJgcwXzxaa	Yes I put Paul Millsap but I think Devin Harris will win the Most Improved player award instead of Danny Granger as many people expected Granger would be the #1 guy after Jermaine O'Neal left Indiana but few people expected Harris to become a star so quickly in New Jersey.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Yes and i agree with your list|`|tLyG8fx1aa	I'll break down each player for you.<br>  1)Danny Granger should have the Most Improved Player Award. He has carried the Pacers on is back and averages the 4th best scoring in the NBA.<br>  2)Paul Millsap should have won last year. Period.<br>  3)Devin Harris can win if the Nets are in the playoffs and are the 7th seed.<br>  4)Chris Duhon is a great candidate but won't get it because he's on the Knicks.<br>  5)Andrea Bargnani is already past his time he shouldn't even be up there. It should be Kevin Martin.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	no,he really didnt "improve" from anything this year. i think granger or harris should win it.<br>  thats just my opinion.
lYnkvRASaa	Nothing surprises me anymore with this team.<br>  <br>  Theodore was caught on camera at a hells angels party in a Hells angels clubhouse.  The loan sharking operation was his father and brothers, well they did the jail time anyway- he probably financed the operation although that was only speculation and never charged or proven.<br>  <br>  I think NHL games could be fixed especially by younger players who have significant roles on the team but are still paid a low entry level salary.<br>  <br>  The mess here is getting crazy, although as more players look like bad guys some pressure comes off Gainey and Carbonneau.  Maybe you can fire the team and keep the coach.  We definitely have some leadership issues here too.  Hamerlik's name implicated surprises me- not the other two.<br>  <br>  ST.Hockeygoalie35.  The Riberio video reminds me of the last troublesome trio we had here in Mtl who were partying too much and associating with the wrong crowd.  Riberio Theodore and Pierre Dagnais.  All three were moved out by Gainey.  I wonder what the fallout with these will be, this is the team that got rid of Carbonneau after giving a reporter the finger on a golfcourse.<br>  <br>  Bob:  La Presse is one of the more respected papers in the city.  The Journal de montreal is the tabloid that I take with a grain of salt.  La presse usually have facts to support their stories.  Although I think it was La Presse that wrote the Basilie said that Gillete said that Habs were for sale story.  There  I think it was probably something taken out of context.<br>  <br>  This one I think there is something too.  At the end of the day they can rent a room at Chez Pare if they want, associate with any criminal the want as long as the show a little effort an Heart on the ice.<br>  <br>  The off ice stuff is affecting the on ice product I'm sure but as a fan I only care about the 12 losses in 15 games.

Right now it's a close call between: Gail Kim, Beth Phoenix, and Sara Del Ray. Gail Kim plays the best small babyface in danger out there(She is better than men at it, maybe except of Rey Mysterio). Beth Phoenix is probably best big power girl heel. Unlike Awesome Kong, she can actually carry the other Divas through good matches. Sara Del Ray is just a solid all around performer.

ecHcOpoXaa	I dont think Pavlik can fight as well as he does at 160 at higher weights, Joe's weight at least would be 168 and leaving Pavlik at a disadvantage. I dont think Pavlik punches as hard or is as fast at 168 or more than he is at 160. Pavlik should stay at middleweight and fight middlewights where he is naturally bigger and stronger than almost all the guys he fights with mayb the exception of Abrham. But if joe would fight kelly i would say good fight but Joe is too fast and kelly is not as good at the heigher weights so Joe by UD.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Calzaghe would kill Pavlik.All Pavlik has is his 1-2 punch other than that he is a straight ahead fighter that doesn't have very good footwork.Calzaghe would be able to land a ton of shots against Pavlik eventually wearing him out in the later rounds.It would be similar to the Roy Jones fight.Pavlik has heart but is limited,which was exposed by Hopkins.That was no fluke,Hopkins is still good enough to beat the crap out of guys who show no movement on defense and don't give you any different punching angles.Calzaghe turned the fight down because he knew it wouldn't even be competitive.Calzaghe by unanimous decision.|`|NSgSaspAaa	Calzaghe all day. I love both, especially Pavlik, but Calzaghe is so good and we've already seen Pavlik not only struggle with smart, quick boxers, but he isn't the same above 160.|`|342e56bc9ac26ffd7479d53bae43615faa	Before Pavlik got waxed by Hopkins I would have said Pavlik but he's too green to have handed Calzaghe a lose.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Joe Calzaghe...|`|l4WEwTWwaa	I'm really surprised people are picking Calzaghe. I pick Pavlik by knockout. If a 43 yr old Hopkins can knock Calzaghe down in the first round and a 39 yr old Jones too then we have a suspect chin. A bad chin against someone like Pavlik with his punching power is not going to get you anywhere. Next Pavlik's loss to Hopkins was a fluke. The entire fight he fought like he was afraid of him and refused to scrap with him believing everything everyone said that he wouldn't be able to knockout Hopkins, if he wouldn't have listened to them and brawled with him instead of boxing he would have won easy. People are only saying Calzaghe because of his recent loss. But I despite his new loss would still pick Pavlik's power over Joe's little pitty pat punches and no chin.|`|dh48AkbCaa	before b-hop got to pavlik, i would probably have picked kelly to win, but for now, i'm gonna go with joe by decision,|`|xLxGgVQyaa	Anyone who seen me post here knows im not a Calzaghe fan.

74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	Wow. So many emotional answers here. People love to think that a guy who moves up in weight can't be beat at the lower weight but I seem to recall an ordinary fighter named Dave Tiberi beating James only to be robbed of the decision. James was not impossible to hit. He also drew with an old Mike McCallum.  Joe has felt the canvas, as has James, but that does not mean his chin is suspect. He has fought many hard hitting fighters and dont take anything away from Jeff Lacy, a former Olympian who was just beaten by very good fighters. So many of you guys are novice fans obviously and it shows in how you analyze matchups. Joe barely hitting James? Youve got to be kidding me. Joe is taller, faster, busier and would hit James a lot although James would also hit back. In this matchup I see a very close decision with Joe pulling it out by his work rate. maybe even a split decision. Yes, he is, was, that good.  And when I say that I mean both of them.  Word.|`|342e56bc9ac26ffd7479d53bae43615faa	Forget about the James Toney Heavyweight...that was his second career and he was good considering he's 5'9, knocking at 40, and never been knocked out as an out of shape 240 pounder. James Toney at 160 and 168 was as beautiful and complete boxer that has ever stepped into a boxing ring. That James Toney would have waxed Calzaghe inside of 10 rounds...easily. Joe would barely have landed a punch and Toney would have been all over his a** No contest. Joe held a belt for a while, he beat Kessler and Lacy(who were great prospects at best,) he beat a very very very past his prime Roy Jones Jr and he outlasted an old Hopkins who although past his prime still had some gas in his tank. But he never saw anything like a young James Toney and that's why Joe's stellar career is suspect to everybody accept his die hard English fans.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	the greatest super middleweight of all time ,11 years champion,46-0 undefeated ,with a fortune of 110 million euros easily by UD:)<br>  <br>  to the boys under me <br>  <br>  KEEP DREAMING LOL|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Toney is not easy to hit even old and out of shape,so a prime Toney would win by T.K.O. in the 10rd.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	James Toney...|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Do you really hate Joe? What are you doing to him? You're hurting him! James Toney is a little bit out of Calzaghe's league and is a better boxer, puncher, more educated, better technique and skill level.<br>  <br>  Toney is a better boxer than he is a puncher but I do not think it will be an early rounds blow-out fight, despite Joe's suspect chin. Toney and Calzaghe will have a feeling out process in the first two rounds and will at first be a bit mundane but as the rounds progresses Toney will gradually build up a solid lead and out-box and out-think his opponent. I do not think Toney has much to worry about Joe's punching power,<br>  because his power is overrated and will not be much of a factor in this fight. It will get more lopsided as the fight progresses and Joe's corner stops the fight by the end of the tenth round. Toney wins on a TKO over Joe when his corner throws in the towel.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	This wouldn't be a green Jeff Lacy, a timid BHop or an extrememly old RJJ.  A prime 168 pound James Toney would smash Joe Calzaghe.  <br>  <br>  James Toney takes shots from 250 pounders, Calzaghe would have nothing to keep him off - Toney was slick and had faster hands, he would stand right in front of the awkward Calzaghe and pound at him with body shots and counters.<br>  <br>  Toney by TKO in 4.<br>  <br>   - the the guy who answered saying that Joe was faster, that is simply wrong, and pointing to a couple less than stellar performances is ridiculous too as Calzaghe lost a fight on one judges card to Robin Reid....beyond that, James Toney is going to finish his career with about 90 fights, 2x as many as Calzaghe, and against the variety of opponents and styles - exactly the type of career challenges Calzaghe avoided like the plague.|`|dh48AkbCaa	only a prime jones jr beat toney below 175, and as good as joe is, toney would win on points, fairly close, but unanimous.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	joe by decision if he stays on the ropes easy win if he is off the ropes and fights in  center of the ring it will be a good foght|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Toney does to Calz what he did to Nunn.  Wears  him down methodically, and blasts him for a late ko.
ElH6jMEXaa	Archie Moore would have KOd him.  If both Hopkins and Roy, who were not big punching light heavyweights, could put Calzaghe down, then a guy who has knocked out more fighters than ANYONE would have caught him.<br>  <br>  This isn't an assault on Calzaghe, who I've never been a big fan of, but Moore was very crafty and hit big with both hands.  Calzaghe throws a lot of punches, which means he would give Moore a lot of chances to throw big counters - Moore was also physically bigger and stronger, and would be able to wade in and bully Calzaghe against the ropes and into uncomfortable posistions.<br>  <br>  I could see Moore looping a left hook, shifting an off-balance Calzaghe into a big right hand.<br>  <br>  Moore by KO in 8.|`|AA12325046	Sir, Joe Calzaghe finished his career on a high note by defeating Hopkins and an over the hill Roy Jones.  He did have fast hands and did retire undefeated but Archie Moore is quite a different story as we are taling about a guy that had the most knockouts in boxing history, that gave Marciano a tough battle going toe to toe with the Rock, was Champ for about 10 years.  I believe Calzaghe would have went to the canvas several times against the hard punching Mongoose and the referee would have stopped the fight in round 7 as he was about to go down again.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	The great LH of all time against a slapper?

I think it's the winter. Bobby Czyz was one of my favorite.|`|AA12325046	I believe that Calzaghe would have ran and ran some more landing some ineffective punches against Czyz.

ZKikquiOaa	First roof vs porro.  Roof prism binos are those binos with two parallel tubes, they're straight out, very compact, very sleek.  Porros, are the classic bino shape, there's an offset between the rear(occular) lens and the front (objective) lens.  Here's the rule of thumb, for binos under $150, stick with porro.  Porros are easier to make, hence for cheaper binos they usually have better quality glass.  Above $150 then it's all roof territory, because they're more waterproof and well people just like them better cause they look prettier.<br>  <br>  The field of view of a bino determines how much area you can cover.  Usually given in something like 400' at 1000 yards.  This is important if you use it for birding or when you need to scan an area for something.  If you already know where your object is and just need a better look, it's not that big of a deal.  For birding you want to find binos with the biggest field of view.<br>  <br>  There are a few other things you need to look for.  These are the things generally listed on the box.<br>  <br>  1.  First, lens coating.  There are 3 levels of coating, from best to worst they are, Fully Multi Coated, Multi Coated, and Fully Coated.  Sometimes only marked as FMC, MC or FC.<br>  <br>  2.  Prism type, BK-7 or BAK4, BAK4 are generally better than BK-7<br>  <br>  3.  For magnification, stay with binos under 10x, anything above will require some type of image stabilization or be mounted on a tripod.<br>  <br>  4.  For roofs, look for binos with phase correction, sometimes noted as PC-3.<br>  <br>  For use on a ship though you might want one that has image stabilization, those are expensive.<br>  <br>  Bushnell are well priced, they have some crappy binos and some very good ones.  I own a pair of Bushnell Legend in 8x26, awesome pair for the price.<br>  <br>  Nikon make great binos, but they do have some crappy one out there also.  I don't much care for their action series, but their travelite series are great.|`|3Xvs3t8Faa	buy maybe three pairs at a time and make sure you can return them all because that's the key point and you know if they are true quality if you can see clearly into your neighbors bathroom <br>  Good Luck!!
9MtS42oWaa	Great news Caine we are Miles ahead in Football and Business terms|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Just think of how many ￡50,000 players Celtic could buy now. Were not jealous as it doesn't matter how much money they have if they don't invest it in the team it is not a threat to others. The only person who will benefit is Lawwell himself.|`|SjVukApqaa	Nice to see one of the Old Firm getting their house in order (if you believe the figures) but other than, maybe and it's a big maybe, dominating the SPL until their rivals sort themselves out financially, what difference is it going to make in the long run? <br>  <br>  It will certainly make a lot of money for those running the club of course but will they turn that over to improve the standard of football on offer, improve amenities at Parkhead, give the fans a break on ticket prices? From what we're hearing from Celtic supporters at the moment, all of that is somewhat doubtful. Time will tell.|`|bzwSCm6taa	the jealousy is killing me..not...........just hope your boasting when your debt free and title free in may...mon the bears...<br>  <br>  miles ahead alex..2 points is hardly miles....lmao|`|BdiQPKn0aa	I didn't know but i'm gonna have to drown my sorrows tonight to try and forget how jealous i am|`|RTCKiu03aa	good the famines over then lol|`|8tnKpZcoaa	Caine, another pointer to the state of your mental health,did you know that failues like yourself who experience Schadenfreude are in a group of people who have little or no self esteem, what makes you feel so worthless ? is it just your physical appearance ? or as I suspect, something much deeper. Looking forward to more posts to continue with psycho analyses, you freak.
QIWvbNFWaa	Serious Contender.<br>  <br>  Michael V You just saying that because you hate Vikings and you love Da Bear|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	As long as the Vikings think Tavaris Jackson can be an NFL QB they are doomed for flop.  They also need some better WR.  AP is a great back but he'll have a short career if they continue to use him as hard as they have the past two years.|`|HvDTEsBRaa	i believe they will be a serious contender. i think they might land a wide Receiver and a few defensive backs. this will practically complete their roster. i think tavaris jackson is still to young to judge, and one of these seasons he will have a real breakout season. Still minnesota might bid for matt cassel, micheal vick, derrick anderson (i dont see that happening), jeff garcia, donovan mcnabb, or even kurt warner. i strongly believe that minnesota will land one of those QBs. Minnesota will give the giants a run for there money. Minnesota wil probably land the number three spot in the NFC, maybe even number two. Peterson will have a great season as always. The Vikes really only need just one wide Receiver, berrian is gonna stay. I see the vikings in the NFC championship game next season, MAYBE even the Superbowl, hey the giants did it in 2007, so could the vikings.  (best answer please, most people are trash talking)|`|cdQryr7paa	They will be solid on defense as they were this year.<br>  They obviously have a great running game.<br>  I think their success or failure relys on who is at the QB position.<br>  They are shopping hard for a good QB.<br>  But at the same time, even if they have a good QB by the time the season starts they will need to find some decent WRs to catch the ball.<br>  If they can get a decent passing game to put with their running game, they will win a lot of games, and probably the division.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	Avatar how ids T-Jack the worst QB ever in NFL history he isnt even the worst on his team or in the NFL last year think about stuff before you say it and make yourself look stupid|`|J74Y5LKxaa	First they need to figure out who their quarterback is going to be before being considered a contender for anything!|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Flop.  The reason is because so many people are predicting big things from them with little to base it on.  No quarterback, one dimensional offense, great defense...it's all been figured out before (by even the casual fan, let alone professional coaches).  They need to open up the offense and take pressure off of AP and relieve the pressure their offense puts on the defense.  Oh, and did I mention they need a quarterback?  Far to many pieces missing to say they are a serious contender, after all they weren't even a contender this year (missed playoffs).|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	If the vikings get a good QB in a trade or free agency(Jeff Garcia, Donovan Mcnabb, Matt Cassel, Michael Vick, even Derek Anderson) they are a lock for the playoffs. Their Defense is amazing, their running game is crazy good with Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor and they have good receivers. They are one of the few teams that are a few pieces away from a Super Bowl run.|`|ejrVotg8aa	I think they're all hype. Too many holes and people are putting them high because of two big names. They have a good front four, two of them will have suspensions and one is aging. But their secondary is aging and weak. They have a good line and running game but the passing game is weak. They're a pretender.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Contender, have to beat NYG and AZ|`|UgnMjtYDaa	They need a better coaching staff, better qb or qb coach im not sure about travaris jac. and a big time wr. then they would be a real playoff team.|`|JpvXhgmraa	Nothing, lol, the combine hasn't even happened yet. But unless they get a real QB, I will continue to think nothing of them. Mick Vick maybe?|`|AA10225723	If they can get a decent QB, definitely a serious contender.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	They need a good quarterback, a leader|`|smFHGStuaa	The teams that pick top in the draft (and therefore are the worst in the league... consistently have issues at QB.  The Vikings got by with Gus Ferrotte this year... he will not be a 16 game or even 12 game QB next year -- I am from Tulsa and love Gus.  But, he is not a starter and never has been he is a back up that can come in and win 3/5 or 5/7 games at best while the starter is healing.<br>  <br>  T. Jackson is not a starter either...he is not even a good backup in my opinion... maybe in a few years he can be good enough to crack the starting lineup like David Gerrard did in Jacksonvill after many years of riding the bench behind Leftwich.  But for now, the Vikings are an 8-8 team at best until they have a consistent QB -- If Sanchez falls far enough dont be surprised if they move up to get him or they may feel that J.David Booty is a good prospect in his second year. <br>  <br>  If they had any confidence at all in their QB's they wouldnt still be looking for Brett Favre as their 40 year old answer.|`|9dba8fd793d11e5dc0acb7b038cbfd7baa	They need to go out an sign Jeff Garcia.  I know that Garcia is somewhat injuryprone, but he is a smart quarterback who knows how to handle an offense.  The Vikings have an incredible running attack, so Garcia would not need to throw the ball more than 20 times a game for most of the year.  If they add Garcia, then they are the favorite to once again win the NFC North, and to make a run to the NFC Championship Game.|`|I8laNaM8aa	i will say this again the vikings will find a way to get a qb in the draft now they may be able to get a quality qb from free agency but they draft their futue qb this year if that is sanchez or safford is to be determined but they also get a good reciever either in free agency or draft again. them two and a replacement for mr. sharper they can make strides.|`|pDrm6J2Taa	Really the Vikings, this year will be bad. Jackson is a horrible Qb for them, and I feel that Adrian Peterson won't be able to carry this team once more for a contending title spot.|`|ffjXucSWaa	they were a contender this year, and i'm sure they will be net year too. They need to work on there passing game alot more, but with TJ they will never win a SB|`|0zdD3Kk8aa	they need a quarterback and a new coach and they would be a phenomenal team other wise their gonna fall strait on their face 6-10 watch|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Peterson will amaze us again.

UvG0vP1jaa	nothing you do now will help your physical conditioning in three days so concentrate on getting enough rest, eating well (lots of carbs), do not use any alcohol, cold medicine or other drugs that will have an adverse affect (like acetaminophen).  If you have inflammation use ibuprofen.  Concentrate on the mental game.  If you have access to the track where the race will take place go there as much as possible.  focus on the finish line.  At night visualize that finish line and how strong you will be crossing it.  Relax as much as possible.  Spend time with friends that calm you.  try to forget your rival (it will be hard) and keep telling yourself that you are powerful even if you don't believe it.  GOOD LUCK!|`|tExZ9tQTaa	i'd suggest for the next two days do wind sprints were you jog for a distance and then sprint and then jog and rotate for whatever distance you are running. but on the third day try to go easier and don't push yourself even farther you will just be spent the next day.|`|KqWivPpAaa	do some sprints of course. wind sprints, 30 60s, maybe have some practice runs, lose your water weight, shave all the hair off your body. many things but mainly just have confidence in yourself.|`|NJ9qPuDqaa	One of the keys to running fast is form, try pumping ur arms at the shoulders real hard or act like ur goin to punch urself n the face.

While sitting on the bench with the weight bar (or whatever you rig up) being held behind your head (across your back) spring up to a standing position then sit back down and repeat.

Also just go to your local high school track and practice the distance you are going to run.|`|85dnSnVAaa	practice practise and practice is only word for you but don't try much hard may be you lose or got pain on your feet but start increasing gradually.

98946058141a703b0c2073a58600691aaa	5'4" middle.... ummm.... yeah.<br>  unless you grow another 8 inches your chances of being a middle are pretty slim.  don't get me wrong I have played against some great middles that are only 5'9" but they are some of the quickest players you will ever see and they had like 25+ inch verticals|`|UYTMABFLaa	At your age, I believe the nets are 7'4" high. Being able to reach high on a block is important for middle blockers, because well... it will help you block! Work on training from a standing position, because a good block doesn't get an approach. <br>  <br>  Also focus on your footwork, both for your approach and on moving to the sides for your block. Step-cross-hop is difficult to get in your head, especially when you are first learning. Practice this, and you will get out to block faster, setting you up for success because you will have time to get set for your blocks. <br>  <br>  There are many different workouts you can do to increase your vertical, such as lunges, squats, and doing your approach or block numerous times, always focusing on getting higher. These can be done with or without weights, like hand weights, weighted vests, or jumpsoles, all of which I have used to increase my own vertical. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|W5AN9LYhaa	8'2" is about average for a 13 year old. You're still young, so I'd work on everything and keep your mind open. You don't know yet how tall you're going to be, and the more you play, the more you'll come to know what you like best about playing volleyball. 5'8" middle blocker is about the shortest you can get away with on a good high school team.  <br>  <br>  At 13, I'd focus on improving speed and strength. Quick feet dot drills - scissors, around the world, etc. Also, exercises using your own body weight - lunges, push ups, body weight squats, pull ups, etc.|`|fevBfCBZaa	maybe, but if you want to be on varisty in high school and play college you might want to grow a lot!!! <br>  But, if you don't grow.... just work on your jump! if you can jump really high you dont have to be that tall!!<br>  goood luck to you!!!!!!!|`|Qct074kuaa	well since your young, you have time to improve, practice jumping a lot...bend to your knees and thrust your body upwards using your arms like you would to spike the volleyball...

8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	Yes, it can. If the fight is primarily a stand up striking competition it won't make too much of an impact. If it's a grappling match, it will seriously affect a competitor's ability to grab, hold, and lock an opponent.|`|vv5H7TRCaa	a fighter will no not be allowed to be greased the cut man in the ufc wipes them down before entering the cage and in between rounds the cut man is the only one applying Vaseline mind you if you can get away with it it could be a disadvantage on your part also you are going to be grabbing the other guy and Vaseline transfers|`|job9o5ioaa	Yeah, in grappling it does.     One can not get a solid grab and will slide all the time.    But as we know it's not allowed and in some accidental cases, it's just a little neglect of the trainer which is not that big of a deal concerning the amount that has accidentally been utilized.|`|681cdc7b4046a0a5541c9e3d94132feaaa	Before a fight, yes. Applying vaseline on a fighter after the first round when hes already drenched in his own sweat makes no difference at all, hes already slippery as can be.  Complaining to the NSAC and getting them to wipe the other fighters back off(sweat, grease and all) in between rounds, should have helped BJ in a drastic way.|`|gERaZGZeaa	No, especially when it's only a little bit of vaseline that was residue from the trainer's hands which was immediately wiped off, and ESPECIALLY not when the fighter was scoring jabs and takedowns whenever he wanted.|`|gBO908P6aa	Yea maybe if he fell into a vat of grease and walked onto the mat like that sure.  If not, it won't help...AT ALL.

Did you just mean as a head coach?|`|zOw22PDyaa	mike ditka did 1985 as a head coach and 1971 as a player|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Da Coach, Mike Ditka    There are probably a bunch of position coaches that have rings as players and staff, but as head coach I only know of Ditka for sure.|`|kBf7OUXNaa	I watched alot of football and to be honest,   I only believe John Madden, was the closest thing to that. No coach has done that i dont believe.    Madden was a palyer for the Eagles and got hurt in like week 4.

CZLpTU8iaa	I've had mine for a long time! Just sit on the ground. Push down. Reach. Lunges. Legs together and bend over and put your hands as far on the ground as possible! Don't worry, it took me a while to get it! Don't do it without stretching enough. I did that once and i pulled a muscle soooo bad i couldn't even cross my legs! No joke! Good luck!|`|e158WyFGaa	I am working on it and i finally got it today it took a month so i would just practice.|`|dkTAZmKSaa	i have my left split and right it took me about 2 months. i stretched everyday. Also do lunge's and use the wall and sit against it and stretch. i hope this helped.|`|zXRYDuH4aa	well use a wall, try to flatten ur legs agianst the egde of it sit so ur not in pain but u feel a stretch and just sit there do home work while you sit, in like 8 minutes try to push your self further then wait and etc. it helps you strech way further than u normally would
F2ygsPEbaa	It is if you intend to swim again next year.  Think of this as the beginning of the off-season conditioning program.  Also, if you are getting school credit for this as a PE class, that might also be part of the requirement.    If you are NOT swimming next year, and are not ALSO doing this for school credit, I think it is legitimate to ask your coach if you could be excused.  But if you go there, don't expect to win any respect or popularity contests from your teammates.  People who work hard in life tend to resent those who don't, particularly when those who don't are not held accountable by the leaders.  Just something to think about.|`|pXhoYvzkaa	yes.  it is good conditioning  but if you have to leave practice early for stuff for school or studying thats okay go for as long as you can.  good luck next season!!!!!|`|fZY8EkVDaa	Yes! It's important because you need to wind down completely. Just think of it as a really big cool down. You need to get your body off that "sprinting mode" and put it back to normal. This time of season is called tapering and it is really important :)|`|HYVmgV7Vaa	Yes, unless you want to quit.  You want to quit, quitter?|`|rXuSL76saa	I still think you should, well i would.  because i lovee swimming.

UuNkAgZ3aa	The venerable .30-06.  Load it light with a 125grain bullet and take varmint class game easily.  Load it with a 220 grain bullet and drop a grizzly.  On of the most versatile rounds in the .30 caliber class.|`|rWYp4ekeaa	I would have to say my fathers Winchester model 70 in a 270. win. It has taken more moose then i will ever. It has great storys and memories behind this gun and its important to me and him. I shot my first moose with it and i really enjoy shooting it.|`|ejoBcPDZaa	My dad's old 1911. He's had it ever since i could remember. Great old gun. It's always in it's box and it looks brand new.  I think it's a .45ACP.|`|HUQMqdDqaa	AK-47 is the ONLY firearm that would qualify for, "If you could only have one gun."     First off, the AK is the most dependable firearm ever made. It's able to function in any environment. It is cheap and easy to repair/modify. It has reasonable accuracy, reliable up to 300m. They require little upkeep to keep them functional. Ammo is widely available and cheap so it is easy to stockpile. It is just a great overall gun.    Make no doubt, in a Mad Max type world it is the only weapon I would want my hands on.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	My Mosin Nagant 91/33 Sniper Rifle would have to be my choice, accurate, 100% Dependable. Ammo is cheap and it is powerful enough for anything.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	AA-12 full auto shotgun.    It's a full auto combat shotgun that delivers unmatched firepower.  It was specially designed so that it requires very little maintenance.  It has large capacity magazines that hold up to 32 rounds.  It is even capable of firing miniature grenades.    Go on youtube and look it up.  It is really one unbelievable weapon.|`|VP48PjM9aa	My Remington Model 700 VLS .243 Win.  For all that I do it is perfect.  First, it is beautiful especially with the laminate stock.  I chose to mount the Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14x40 SF.  I have Galco sling that I bought years ago, the leather is braided, it came in a very dark brown, I picked a good black leather dye and made it black.  The entire package is awesome.  Above all of that, it is a tack driver.  It took me some time and money but I did find the rounds that it likes.  I can lite up any varmint at farther than I can shoot and bust a hog or a whitetail at 400+ yards, although I will not chance a shot over 300.  I will never part with it.  .243 Win is the best all around caliber for my needs.  The first rifle my dad bought me for my 12th birthday was a Remington Model 7400 .243 Win, it now belongs to my 9 year old son.  Pray for all whitetails that venture around his stand, he can out shoot most folks that you and I know.|`|AA12061216	A DPMS Panther .308, it is great for home defense, the range, and for hunting.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	M-14 with the option to go full auto.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	12 ga. with a smooth bore and a slug barrel cause I could kill anything with it.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	A Ruger Mini 14.......    http://www.gunblast.com/Ruger-NEWMini14....

The firearms I already have are meant to be with me for the rest of my life.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	If I could only own one gun and wanted something with the most versatility I'd probably pick a TC Contender or Encore. That way I'd have access to a variety of calibers ranging from .22 rimfire up to high-power rifle and 12 gauge shotgun with a single firearm.     Fortunately we don't have to make those kinds of choices.|`|QrjuueMCaa	My TC Encore with the 22-250, 243, .50 and turkey barrels. -Hey, it's just 1 gun.    If that doesn't count, I'd have to say my Kimber .45 Eclipse Custom II. -with a pile of ball and hp +P ammo.|`|4CINI0fsaa	my grandfathers favorite gun because it was really special and important to him|`|QC2NozBkaa	12ga shotgun.  It can do about anything.|`|31CUQuKNaa	the one my father left me when he passed, 308 model 88 winchester. shoots today as straight as it did in 1958 when he bought it. will pass it to my son when i stop hunting or die|`|TEAKcA5Laa	if ammo is not a problem, i would have a bolt action .223. it will do anything i ask of it within reason. ammo is easy to carry, reload, plentiful and very accurate. it will take game from squirrel to deer.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	Rossi camp gun.  Comes with three barrels I would pick 243 22LR and 20 gauge.  I could still bird hunt and hunt big game I think this make a good choice.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	My cz 416 Rigby.  I haven't stumbled upon anything yet it can't handle.  I reload, so shells aren't really too bad.  Powder does get expensive at 100 grains a pop though.  You just have to check to make sure mice haven't built a nest in the barrel before you touch one off.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	357 Dan Wesson Pistol Pack  It can be used for home defense, concealed carry. small game hunting or small deer hunting with ammo and barrels adjusted accordingly, the ammo is very commonly available    No other gun has all those attributes|`|V0qWtXOtaa	ithica 12 pump,i've killed everything from birds to deer to pigs without a problem.|`|0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	I'd pick an over/under with the biggest caliber I could buy for the rifle barrel and a 12 gauge for the bottom. As far as I know, Remington is the only company still making them, and their biggest rifle caliber is .223. I would rather have an old Savage model 24 though. I could still hunt anything on the continent, using 12 gauge slugs for anything that was to big to take with the rifle.

Reason for my thoughts is that when you get old and take them out (in like a year because you and everyone else will move onto something cooler) it will be really attractive because it will look like you have vagina's hanging off the sides of your head!!! DO IT!!!               -Nothing cooler than having ears that look like vaginas!!!!|`|Z9HjsTXoaa	dont|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Don't. You'll look stupid now and stupider when you're 80. And this is the hunting section...|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	Ha. Wrong section. You might want to select the right area when you submit your question next time. The first thing I thought was, why would you need to gauge your ears? Earplugs only come in one size. We mostly talk about guns here. Unless you want a twelve gauge in your ear, you might want to look into beauty or cosmetics or something like that. Have a good one.      Oh and on a personal note...don't do it. Sagging earlobe holes are not attractive, ever. I'm sorry if that isn't what you'd like to hear, but it should save you some grief later.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Unless you are a member of a primitive tribe, you wind up looking like some suburban wannabe jack-off. Don't do it.|`|nooi0ldjaa	ha ha my sister thought she was cool by doing the same thing, now she gets to squeeze the puss out of her ear lobe every night...    not only that, if i was fighting someone with gaged ears its the first thing im going for...you don't want that do you? don't set your self up for a VERY painful weakness.    if you really want to deal with all the con's it comes with...do what the rest of us do when we need to look something up...google it.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	Were do you people come from I bet you are a soft air guy too. Don't do it. is my only answer|`|AA12243350	I suppose since you placed this in the hunting section, you expect us to tell you to shoot a hole thru your ear.   I have a suggestion, figure out what the proper place to post this is, and until you do, forget about poking another hole in your head.
UWctMa0Taa	Not too many juniors play Junior Varsity Basketball.    It isn't weird, or uncommon, but typically, the Juniors who LIKE basketball are playing varsity.

PrsbAjZAaa	Just your every day medical    fitness    running  sprints  push ups    all that    drugs tests    go through any accident history , if he's had a recent injury but over come it they'l check that out to see if he's back at full fitness etc      just like the Army one to be honest|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	I believe they just do a series of tests to check that the player has no injuries and that their health is all good... that's why you dont get many fail.. However Giovanni dos Santos failed his medical at pompey last week as his ankle injury was still slightly showing... Sometimes however clubs are willing to sign a player that is injured because they dont NEED them right away..|`|uXXbegw5aa	A medical involves checking the player's physical capabilities to play football for the club.  Things such as O2 intake, weight, height, injury check ups, blood pressure, blood-tests, sight tests, reactions etc are tested.   The doctor then evaluates the result and tells the club that the player is fit to play for the club, or that he's unfit to play or an injury that will cause problems.|`|C6d5yElWaa	Not sure of the process but it mustn't be very good if people like Owen Hargreaves (severe tendinitis in both knees) and Louis Saha (...) can pass them.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	I think its like a bleep test, drug test etc.    To check you are fit, and have no medical problems, or drug or drink influences.|`|aB4n96vhaa	i saw it on sky sports the other day they go thru everything including height ,weight diet the also do the beeper test where you do shuttle runs against the beeper|`|Hiasgb75aa	I just imagine the player running on a treadmill with a bunch of wires attached to him.

bej55wxUaa	He is living in Martin O'Neill's shadow.  Not a fair comparison from a finances point if view.  O'Neill had much more to spend, and the money in England, even for smaller clubs, was not as much of an issue as it is nowadays.  On that subject though, you could argue that O'Neill spend money more wisely than Strachan has.  On the other hand.....    .....Managers should be judged on results first and foremost, if they can be successful and have their team playing attractive football too, that's great.  Statistically, Strachan has a better record than MON, the best since Jock Stein, in fact.  Maybe some of the fans unhappy with Strachan need to question what they want more; prizes, or a Celtic man in charge ?    A tough one.|`|exARv7Bmaa	There's certainly a section of their 'fans' who will never be happy until they have a true "Celtic" man in charge (not that it's helped them too much in the past!) and there are others who feel he's not 'tactically' minded enough to win in Europe (no wins in 18/19 games...they might have a point there!), but I think the majority are happy enough at the moment...though that's bound to change big time when they surrender the league to Rangers and fail to win one of the cups!|`|LoFCv31waa	What? Are the Tims after wee Gordy again....doesn't take much does it?|`|QfAlbKH9aa	I only ever hear that from a couple of people in here, everyone I know has the intelligence to see that wgs has done wonders with what hes had compared to a certain other manager|`|7KkrXlalaa	Spot on fella.Although sometimes his starting 11 pees me off,i think with the money,or lack of it,he has  done a good job.What is starting to become a bitter pill,is the fact we have had good revenue from champs league every season,but wee gordy is not getting much of it.Its been plain to see we need a good left back but still no move for one.This makes the feat of winning 3iar more incredible and i for one will remember what he achieved on a shoestring budget.|`|h7GtCCC7aa	To me, he is between a rock and a hard place.    On one hand, he has delivered success domestically and taken Celtic further in Europe than O'Neill ever did.    On the other, most of his 'higher' priced signings have been poor and he has been in charge of Celtic at a time when Rangers (realistically their only challengers in the league) have been pretty awful themselves.    I see plenty reasons why Celtic fans wouldn't be happy with Strachan but how can he be replaced when essentially he has done nothing wrong?|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes he great he will be next week.|`|o3I2iVdyaa	his success is good but his team selectons at times baffles me.  he has favourites and sticks by them when obviously they should not be in the team|`|fQgaQx4baa	you cannot argue with his record at parkhead he only falls down with his transfer dealings but then again what manager has a perfect record there as u say maybe he has tried to sign other players in the past and the board have failed to back him|`|57rbgBw2aa	He's not worthy, he is a boards man always has been and don't kid yourself dude,  there has been no competition in Scotland any fighting  sides we've met have beaten or drawn with us.. look at Aberdeen, I'C'T' recently, the Orcs even, we've played the worse football ever witnessed at Parkhead he's taken away all our flair and sold or tried to humiliate our individual talents he's bought players to weaken other teams then played them out of position or not at all .. he's going and thank the good lord,  his tactical awareness is nil in fact he's a sad wee misfit  I hope Reid joins him very soon and they remember to take their wee union jacks tae hell with them|`|8kpvTUQaaa	It's not Strachan those unhappy Tims should be going after, it's Lawwel and the board, they're the ones pulling the strings, wee Gordo's just a puppet, or muppet-puppet to some of them.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Nae pleasing some fowk!!

The manager and the team should be giving the fans full support.  Ok, there have been dodgey team selections that may have sost a few points but no one is perfect, 3 in a row - what else is he suppsed to do!    edit: I totally agree|`|S0LSmJ9haa	he will never gain respct from a few of our supporters Saiorse as he isn't a real "celtic" man., though what is i have yet to see.  I post on a Celtic forum quite regularly and I admit to seeing a few posters wanting him gone, his tactics and stubborness being some of the reasons.  I think at the moment the Celtic support is a little upset by the lack of signings, we did sign 8 new players but only a couple will be anywhere near ready for the first team. This has called for a shout of anybody's head lol..Strachan doesn't make the decisions on our signings, he is asked for an opinion, and his opinions this time I feel have secured a good future for Celtic with the addition of young players that will boost the future team.  If Roy Keane takes over, I am sure there will be many happy fans as he is a "Celtic" man, however his ability to manage has yet to be seen in club like ours.  maybe then they will have a reason for the criticism.|`|2sxiHRvzaa	my only moan saiorse is he seems to pander to the board.everyone,and i mean everyone knows we need a left back.to come out with it would take 8 million to replace naylor is a feckin joke.he has to come out with better stuff than that crap
Wv0UKUdiaa	Robben himself said that Messi is in his own league.....|`|1XEUETPKaa	Definitely Messi.

AA11033942	I have no idea what the difference is between A, B and C class. It's probably an American thing.<br>  <br>  What I say to my friends about technology probably can apply here, which is "If you wanna spend money on something big and important and you're on a budget, always go for the middle range (this makes more sense with computers and the like but follow me here) if you have a choice between expensive, md-range and cheap, always go for the mid range because when new models are released the mid-range quickly becomes the low range and loses more of its value and even quicker.<br>  <br>  When you take something out of the shop (or for a winnebago, off the garage forecourt) it already loses about 20% of its value - so spend as much as you can readily afford. Living in tents is fun anyway, certainly bring one with wherever you drive to and set it up outside your van.<br>  <br>  I hope I haven't completely misread your question - but I'm English and that kind of thing doesn't really go on over here...<br>  <br>  ~Steve

That is illegal.|`|ucot94w3aa	It would be a penalty.  It's essentially the same as tackling out of bounds.    Personal foul.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	He could be penalized!|`|gt0NtM8taa	to correct information police fitzgerald could not have been penalized due to the fact he was forced out of bounds and made several attempts to return to the field of play without slowing down and all those attemps there was another player there. also he is allowed to make the play because the rule states that you can not run out of bounds and come back in and be the first one to touch the player or ball. and the reason he was not flagged was a) he did not run out of bounds he was forced out and b) after leaving the field of play he was not the first one to make contact with harrison it was the lineman who dove...he made contact with harrison's ankle/foot|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	that was illegal as hell, but did the steeler haters who claimed the ref's cheated mention that?|`|F5dXqU78aa	If he is running in bounds he can be blocked and pushed out of bounds, but if he's running out of bounds and trying to get back in bounds (like he must) then the player should be penalized if he blocks him while he is still out of bounds.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	The rules are applied the same as a kickoff. The answer is' yes' its okay. once he's out 'no'
WrDGhduxaa	At 5'5" it is going to be very difficult to run the hurdles.  The highs are 39 inches and the intermediate hurdles are 36".  since you like the 400 stay with it.  Training and hard work will help you do better.  You are in 9th grade, and older and better than before.  It is best to do what you like to do.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Do they still do the steeplechase?|`|yoNyPfMraa	the 400, do what you love and get better at it|`|MEuqT0Rvaa	I'd do which ever one i enjoyed most but if it is really important to place well then i would do which ever one i was best at i would say 400m personally because it sounds like that is your favourite|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Okay, hurdles might be a good choice.  Because your "form" is very important in hurdles, a slightly slower runner can often beat faster runners because the faster runners might not have the form.    I started running the 110 meter high hurdles in ninth grade and was beat a LOT because of my horrible form.  But I kept working at it until I had real good form and then I started beating the other runners because they never got their form down....    There were runners on my team that could beat me in the straight 110 but NOT with hurdles in the way!    If you are talking about running the 400 intermediate hurdles, the same thing applies, but 400 hurdles is MUCH harder than running a straight 400.  By the time you get to the last few hurdles they start to look as high as a fence, and just as hard to get over....

Qd6mOb1saa	Run around and hit more forehand I guess.  Nadal's heavy topsin shot to Federer's backhand has always been a problem for Roger.  But I don't know if running around to hit a forehand would be enough.  Just look at this point...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-lvdvrw5...    Federer only hit one backhand in this rally and ran around to hit many forehands, and still lost the point.  Damn.|`|qSy9hFMDaa	Actually, looking at wimbledon 2008 and australia open 2009.  Federer was actually in a winning position against Nadal.  However he appeared to be too tense and tight to be able to play at his sublime norm. His serve wasn't working and he was relying on his backhand vs nadal's topspin forehand.    Normally, his serve would be sufficient coupled with his awesome forehand.    He really has to get Nadal out of his mind and play normally.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well this has become more and more of a complicated task for federer.. before federers best chace of defeating rafa was ending the points earlier.. taking on more offense and coming into net and hitting flatter forehands...    but now, rafa is doing a better job of hitting flatter forehands... he is becoming a little more offensive.. and he is developing more all court game.. not just purely defensive anymore...    bottom line as well. federer has to improve his physical stamina.. get a little stronger so he can go the distance to beat nadal..  he should also do more serve and volley.. and slice more with his backhand.. keep things lower..|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	He could walk over to Rafa's side of the court then cry like a girl.

Federer is a much better player than Nadal, but Nadal figured out how to beat Federer.

Other players picked up on this & this is how the get to also beat Federer.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	I think there is always room for improvement, even at Federer's level.  Hire an inspirational coach/ mentor like Gil Reyes, or even a legend like Andre Agassi.  Federer needs to get a little stronger, a little faster, and a little more consistent.  He also needs to do a little soul searching and regain his confidence.  He clearly has the physical strength to beat Rafa, but he lacks the mental strength that Rafa has.  By going back to the basics, and working on strength training, I think Federer and regain his confidence.  By hiring a great coach, he also can gain some mental strength.

The information below is about spinal stenosis.<br>  <br>  Spinal stenosis is a medical condition in which the spinal canal narrows and compresses the spinal cord and nerves. This is usually due to the natural process of spinal degeneration that occurs with aging. It can also sometimes be caused by spinal disc herniation, osteoporosis or a tumour.<br>  <br>  Spinal stenosis may affect the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. In some cases, it may be present in all three places in the same patient. Lumbar spinal stenosis results in low back pain as well as pain or abnormal sensations in the legs, thighs, feet or buttocks, or loss of bladder and bowel control.<br>  <br>  Other than that, the biggest hardships that Peyton faced in College was the University of Florida under Coach Steve Spurrier and in the NFL, The New England Patriots under Coach Bill Bellichek.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Besides knee surgery and the lawsuit he faced for mooning a girl in college, I'm not sure he has faced what you would call "hardships".|`|cdQryr7paa	So much money he can't spend it all.<br>  No free time since he spends it all playing football and making commercials.<br>  And, losing playoff games.<br>  Other than that, he seems to do pretty well.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Hardships?  <br>  HARDSHIPS? <br>  Are you kidding me? <br>  Hardships? <br>  Don't talk to me about HARDSHIPS!<br>  HARDSHIPS?????|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	He got blimp in his milk|`|8eaNfLEOaa	Is this a serious question?<br>  <br>  Well you could first look at his college career; but it was outstanding and he was taken number 1 overall in the draft.<br>  <br>  His professional career has been full of success too.<br>  <br>  The things I would say is:<br>  <br>  - His inability to win a Super Bowl (plagued him for his entire career until he won it a couple years back).<br>  - Breaking out of his father Archie Manning's shadow<br>  - Undergoing knee surgery and missing training camp, but still coming back in time for the regular season to win an MVP|`|6AfM6SWaaa	he was born into football.  his dad archie was a great mentor.  he doesnt seem too disadvantaged to me.  he has always had great quick receivers with good hands.|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	Listen If Drew Bloodsd doesn't get best answer this thing is rigged!!!!<br>  HARDSHIPS????<br>  <br>  F n Hillarious.

ci6f63Ifaa	A sharp shooter would be a guy like a Jason Kapono who will benefit from a superstar player getting double teamed and kicking the ball to him for a wide open jump shot.  If he is wide open with no one guarding him, he will knock down the shot a very high percentage of the time. <br>  <br>  However, sharp shooters are usually not as effective when they have real defensive pressure on them.  For example, if Jason Kapono shoots with a player guarding him closely (especially a good defender), he will not shoot as high a percentage.  Past examples of sharp shooters are guys like John Paxson and Steve Kerr on the Michael Jordan Bulls teams of the 90's.  They got plenty of wide open shots due to teams double teaming Jordan.<br>  <br>  A pure shooter is a player like a Ray Allen or a Dirk Nowitski.  A pure shooter can hit their shots with regularity even with someone defending them closely.  Ray Allen will shoot a shot right in a defender's face and Dirk Nowitski does the same.  <br>  <br>  These players do not have to play off of a superstar to get good looks at the basket because their ability to shoot and score is so high that it just doesn't matter.  A true pure shooter can usually shoot and score from anywhere on the court.  <br>  <br>  Past examples are players like Larry Bird and Reggie Miller in the 80's and 90's and Jerry West and Rick Barry in the 60's and 70's.  In my opinion, if I was a GM I'd draft a pure shooter over a sharp shooter any day although having sharp shooters on your team is good also (especially when teams double team your superstar players).|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Basically those guys that shoot about 6 threes a game and make anywhere from 35% and up. Ray Allen, Michael Redd, Peja (However you spell his last name), Kevin Martin, Hedo Turkoglue, and a couple more.|`|bPnmavjZaa	These terms refer to those who can shoot from anywhere on the court and who can make at least 40% of there shots.

KyCJOR2paa	Montreal had enjoyed success again since the lockout mostly because they had the deadliest power play around.  They had Sheldon Souray, Mark Streit, Andre Markov, Alexei Kovalev and many others.  They also were getting great goaltending.  The loss of Souray and Streit has really hurt them, especially their power play.  Also their goaltending has been inconsistent.  I watched a the game they played against Pittsburgh the other night, and while they scored 4 goals, it just seemed like their heads were somewhere else.  I think right now they also really lack leadership in the lockerroom.  Koivu is really the only leader they have right now.  Schneider should really help them.  He is great on the PP with his wicked shot.  He also really needs to be on a good team with a puck moving mindset, not dump and chase.  He also plays with a chip on his shoulder and does not shy away from physical play.  He will be a good presence in the lockerroom.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Worst move- Not resigning Mark Streit.  I realize cap constraints, but compared to what Hamrlik makes, Streit would have been a bargain. The Canadiens PP has suffered. Guess everyone in Montreal who thought it was all Markov and that Streit was riding Markov's coattails was just a bit wrong. Didn't he let Souray go as well?<br>  <br>  Best move- Trading Sergei Samsonov|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Did Gainey hire Guy Carbonneau?<br>  If he did, he chose a coach who was noted for his defensive play during his career, then handed him a roster that lacks any great defensive depth.  It seems to me that if you're going to go for a flash and dash kind of team, you should use a flash and dash kind of ex-player as head coach. <br>  I don't know.  I still think the Habs have a few too many "skilled" players who might be a little over-rated.  They might be expecting more out of Carey Price than he's able to give as well.  <br>  It was probably also a mistake to virtually give away Mikhail Grabovsky.  He's not exactly setting the world on fire in Toronto, but he's playing fairly well.  He'd be valuable on Montreal right now, with Lang (who was Gainey's best move) out with an injury.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Best move as GM-Signing Brett Hull in Dallas was a great move.<br>  Maybe if he can add Lecalvier before the deadline,that would be his best?<br>  <br>  Worst move I'll have to think aboot|`|lYnkvRASaa	His best move by far was hiring Trevor Timmins, Mtl's scouting had been brutal for years with such stellar picks as Rory Fitzpatrick, Lindsay Vallis- basically every big immobile D man from the western hockey league who couldn't skate was a # one pick for us.  <br>  <br>  Worst move may have been Ribero, not trading him but not getting anything for him.<br>  <br>  Overall I support Gainey in that he has not sold the farm for instant gratification  Sometimes he plays things too close to the vest and gives the impression he is doing nothing.<br>  <br>  I think his daughters death has had an effect and may cause people to doubt him.  We may have expected more from him than was realistically possible.<br>  <br>  He has not panicked (although coming back from lunch I heard screams from the bell Centre) and that may be the best thing he has not done.
2VVgxFDKaa	your wrong.  Right now he is still the front runner according to a lot of nba analysts and if nash and duncan won it back to back, then why not Kobe|`|GswnLKtQaa	kobe and bron for the mvp race, it's a toss up but right now james is the favorite.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Tough,if the Cavs go over 50 wins it will be LeBron.But Kobe is close,xD|`|vJyF8siJaa	Right now it's between Kobe and James, I think the one who ends up with the best record will get the MVP.

Poeple are just biased with there favorite players and favorite teams and they dont know basketball well enough.|`|vJyF8siJaa	I agree, but all know the MVP award goes to a player on a winning team and kobe's team back in 2005-2006 won only 42 games and Nash won the award.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think it's because the main promotions WWE and TNA put more of a focus on entertainment,storylines and glamor, as opposed to pure wrestling.This is in order to appeal to the widest possible fanbase for the ratings,tickets and merchandise sales.Technical wrestling seems restricted for the moment to the indy circuit, with the likes of ROH, Chikara and SHIMMER.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	because its sports entertainment wrestling rather than hard fight wrestling.  not everywhere but thats what is televised.<br>  because there is so much other talent styles.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	the TARGET audience in the US is completely different but the independent promotions love it in the US but promotions such as WWE have multiple audiences so they tend to have less technical style wrestling, but the crowd doesnt always chant boring or old school they may chant that to express there disapproval of a certain wrestler such as vladmir kozlov khali or cena occcasionaly, but the US do show their appreciasion to technical style wrestler such as shawn michaels and undertaker, or its maybe that  they just dont have many technical gifted wrestler as compared to the independent promotions.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Well that's not completely true. At indy shows, they often have pure technical wrestling where the crowd can get into it. The mainstream shows in WWE and TNA do have this quality however. Those companies found that brawling drew many fans and then began to start replacing technical wrestling with brawls. Most viewers started getting into this and built their opinions around this. Now people can't appreciate the hard work a wrestler does to perfect the craft of technical wrestling while others will go in and just brawl and get huge amounts of fan support.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Because 99.99% of Americans are idiots.<br>  <br>  <br>  (Even though I'm American, LOL)|`|3icTrKLLaa	Because 85% of United States wrestling fans don't know good wrestling when they see it.<br>  <br>  (I'm from the United States so I'm not dissing the US because i'm from another country).|`|AA10150940	First, I've watched wrestling shows from Mexico and they are actually worse.  So please make sure you have your facts right before pointing fingers.<br>  <br>  Technical wrestling requires knowledge about real wrestling for it to be appreciated.  To someone who has no knowledge, the action can be too slow to really appreciate without knowing what it takes to perform what the wrestlers are doing.<br>  <br>  Professional Wrestling in the US started off much more technical but over time it was learned that they could make more money by attracting more of the general population by making it more spectacular.<br>  <br>  The more spectacular the larger the audience.  The larger the audience the more money coming in.  <br>  <br>  This is why Wrestling not just in the US but anywhere has gone more sensational than technical.<br>  <br>  Now on the other side, there is a surge in interest in MMA which is first of all not scripted and second of all extremely technical.  Now this is not pure wrestling but come on have you ever really watched a real wrestling match without all the sensational stuff... It's kind of like watching grass grow unless you know exactly what your looking at.|`|zOw0Ta5Oaa	IDK why, but I've actually noticed, Kurt was a hell of a technical wrestler but was a heel and was booed,, I think if would've went to Mexico and Japan he'd would've been more popular, In Mexico and Japan technical wrestling is more popular than a brawler type wrestler, in both country's fans look into good quality wrestling instead of popularity, I mean look at John Cena, he sucks *** in wrestling if he was to be in Mexico or Japan he would've been kicked out but mostly WWE fans from both Japan and Mexico would've not booed him but if it was CMLL or NJPW they would've just say "get the **** out"|`|2y2p3ww3aa	Because most of them know very little outside the wwe...( i kno a lot of ppl might thumb me down but this is true)....as far as they are concerned wwe is the "wrestling universe" and there is nothin outside this...(dats the way Vince markets his product)...and as far as the wwe is concerned it's "sports entertainment" and that's the way Vince promotes it...so people are used to seeing good entertainers as far as mic skills or gimmicks or storylines are concerned..they hardly(i said hardly not never) see any technical wrestling these days...so they are more into the entertainment factor.....which in this case is opening a can of whoop a$$ as austin puts it|`|9NDL5YQJaa	We have short attention spans.|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Well it looks like the Yank guys have answered for me!!LOL<br>  (mail)

Liverpool fans would soon find out that this was not to be the case.<br>  <br>  The signing was a strange one of sorts because his previous season saw him score just three goals in Karlsruhe's relegation to Division Two.<br>  <br>  Dundee made his Liverpool debut pre-season in 1998 in a friendly 3-1 win at Crewe Alexandra, coming on as a half time substitute for Karl-Heinz Riedle. Liverpool fans then got a better glimpse of him when he appeared in the Carlsberg Challenge tournament in Belfast with Liverpool.<br>  <br>  First impressions of Dundee was a very tall striker but not exactly setting the world alight. When season 1998-99 kicked-off Dundee was in the reserve team before appearing on the first team bench for a UEFA Cup tie against Valencia at Anfield.<br>  <br>  He made his debut as a late substitute for Michael Owen in the Worthington Cup win over Fulham at Anfield in October. After another substitute appearance in Valencia he was then out of Houllier's first team until the end of April, when he made three substitute appearances but looked completely out of his depth.<br>  <br>  His sale to VFB Stuttgart at the end of the season brought an end to his Liverpool nightmare..|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	Nicklas Bendtner.<br>  <br>  Spartak Moscow wanted him for 5million.

4TN6Erq3aa	I know the roid scandal has you discouraged and I hate AROD too, but this is FANTASY baseball, so try to think rationally. Hamilton's career year last year would be considered a disappointing year by ARODs standards, He lost Milton Bradley and AROD lost Abreu but will add Teix, Posada (back from injury) and a full year of Nady. He was on Steroids and probably still is. That's not your problem. Your job is to go out and win the league. Kazmir is arguably a top 5 SP when healthy. Him and Chipper both have injury history but it's more likely the young Kazmir can overcome it rather than Chipper doing so.|`|syzMIfLLaa	with the whole steroid thing, I'd keep Hammy and Chipper.

111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	My husband has been ice fishing, but not lately. I do know that they catch walleye and I'm not sure about the bait. The last time he got invited to go, he turned them down because it was supposed to be windy that day. Well, over 100 guys got stranded on Lake Erie, which is very close to my house. It made national news and if you go on the GMA site, you may find it.<br>  We had a huge warm-up which melted out 18 inches of snow and thawed the lake. You wouldn't catch me out there. I'm stayin home with my cheeto's and hersheys!!! LOL|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I have been ice fishing a lot this winter but not very much in the last week or so because of being busy at work and somewhat sick earlier this week.  As you can see in my picture I have been walleye fishing this year, my favorite, but more recently I've been going after northern pike and crappie.  I usually devote the first month of the season to just walleye.  They are the most predictible and consistant during early ice than they are any time of the year and it's your best chance to catch a wall mounter (like the 10 pounder in the pic).  Then I go after meat (panfish) and fun (northern pike).  It helps me stay sane and keeps the "cabin fever" at bay.  Yes, we do enjoy a malt beverage now and again and the fellowship with friends is a big plus but the fishing is still the main reason I get SO excited for it each year!  I do love to go trout fishing in the spring but first ice gets me more amped than anything else when it comes to fishing.  I almost exclusively fish for walleye and northern with minnows (shiners and suckers) on tip ups.  We are allowed 3 lines in Wisconsin.  For the panfish we use small ice jigs tipped with some sort of grub (waxxies, spikes, mousies) or a crappie minnow.  Sometimes when I'm just going crappie fishing I'll use a #14 or #16 treble hook with a crappie minnow under some form of slip bobber (usually the foam, ice type).  There is only a couple weeks of tip fishing left so then it's just panfishing after that as long as the ice is good.|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Here in Alaska, ice fishing is very popular with the fishing folks.  We have some of the best fishing in the entire world and it doesn't quit when the water gets hard.  In fact, some fishermen think that's the best time to go fishing.  I have been out about a dozen times since just before Christmas and have had great fun.  We mostly fish for rainbow trout for the supper table.  And average for us runs 14 to 18 inches, but there is always the chance of running into something of trophy-sized proportions.  Where we fish in the south-central part of the state, rainbow trout can exceed 8 or 10 pounds.  (Drill a big hole!)  We also fish for lake trout, grayling, salmon, and northern pike.  For the pike and lakers, we use large jigs and spoon lures.  For the trout and grayling, we use smaller spoons or more often baits like shrimp, eggs, or one of the Berkley Power Bait offerings.  The only thing we don't like about it is that within an hour or two, we have our legal limit and it is time to go home and clean fish.  However, supper makes up for it and in a day or two, we are ready to do it all over again.|`|XKdUGiwFaa	I've been ice fishing and it's fun.  There are books and videos on the subject.  Try your local library.  I live in Michigan.  If I had the choice between Florida and ice fishing, I would take Florida about now.  I am sick of winter.|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	i have been ice fishing in easter oregon from the bank of the snake river. sometimes you can find breaks in the ice for a nice hole to fish from...but it is hard because you have to find a place that drops off deep. you can catch the biggest sturgeon ever!<br>  <br>  don't forget your thermos of irish coffee, though!|`|t1zhVVfBaa	Remember to bring beer or it i will be much less enjoyable experience.  Where you going ice fishing?|`|7royFhIgaa	I'm going tomorrow again. We are going for pan fish than walleyes and crappies in the afternoon/evening. We use wax worms for the pan fish and minnows for the crappies and walleyes.|`|AA11306089	I love Ice Fishing.. It's my favoriteee. We usually go for perch, walleye + bass and always use minnows for bait.
mOkuobZlaa	i know i'm supposed to answer your question, but i do have something to ask you. why would he want to come to an organization where he's not wanted, as good as he might be? Brian Burke made it clear he didn't want him in Toronto, because we are going to be rebuilding for a while and Sundin wants to win a Stanley Cup which is not happening in Toronto during his career in hockey. So he doesn't fit with the Leafs = not coming back to Toronto|`|etErp8rcaa	Angie's got it right. Sundin hopes to win a cup before he retires. Toronto is not going to win the Cup this year, and they're likely going to be rebuilding for at least a couple of seasons. Don't know if he'll stay with the Nucks, and honestly don't think they can win the Cup any time soon either (lack of scoring depth and puck moving defenders).|`|zbCh3Lxpaa	<a href="http://sports12.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://sports12.weebly.com</a><br>  <br>  this website has every game playing in NHL all the time and is pretty well updated.

You are disqualified.<br>  <br>  This bothered me in one tournament. They had several divisions. This one division was for traditional weapons kata. Your kata had a 3 minute time limit. This one black belt dropped his weapon and asked to start over. It was allowed. He did this a few times. I couldn't believe it. It got worse. He had the nunchaka. He started with one, then pulled out a 2nd. He dropped them both. Then he pulled out some kama. He dropped one from each hand several times. Then he used the sai. He dropped those too. He dropped every weapon that he had. This was the longest kata I have ever seen. It was also the worst. He should have been disqualified for several things: Dropping the weapon(s), time limit, obviously this was not a traditional kata. They had a division for creative kata.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	Most of the torunaments I attend and NASKA tournments say that if it is a brown or black belt and they drop their weapon they are disqualified.  Students and competitors below that rank are allowed to start again but there is a point deduction so it is all but impossible for them to take first place unless they are very good and the division is very weak.  The other thing with respect to that incident may have been that he had not actaully started his kata and they may have allowed him a second chance on that technicality.|`|AA11264943	I don't disqualify them.  Think of an Olympic skater, they are the best of the best, but even they can fall down at the wrong moment.<br>  <br>  What was more important?  The act of bowing (where the mistake occurred) or the kata itself. <br>  <br>  I once had a master tell me that he determined the final score of a forms competition based on the mat entry, introduction and transition to "ready position". <br>  <br>  I thought this was proposterous, the kata itself is most important.  <br>  <br>  James|`|QM2A6rBlaa	Instant disqualfication in the adult division. There is no excuse for anybody dropping a weapon.|`|moVU2CY8aa	losing control or dropping a weapon has always been at least point deductions if not out right disqualification in any tournament that I have ever had anything to do with. Most of the ones I have personally been involved with had their own stated rules regarding it and only a few left it up to individual judges. In my book dropping a weapon is an automatic failure on a belt test and an automatic disqualification in competition. For a loss of control I think I would only deduct points and how many points would depend on how bad the loss of control was and if it was just a 1 time thing or if it was multiply times through out routine.|`|8BwvOuIXaa	If a weapon is dropped, that person is disqualified.  The only issue I have with that is some Kung Fu bo forms that I've seen, their bo is supposed to strike the floor.  This has always caused issues when judging open tournaments.  If the competitor states prior to starting that their weapon will hit the floor 'X' number of times during the kata, then I judge accordingly.  We've had many discussion about this issue at the black belt meeting prior to the tournament starting and for some reason we all cannot get on the same page.  If i'm the center judge and it's basically my call, I will discuss this with the other ring judges and come to an agreement as to disqualify, mark down or accept the form.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	What kata?Kenjutsu kata are usually at most 3 moves IAIDO usually just one.They have 2 man kata which involve very short clashes .<br>  <br>  If he did some kind of karate type kata I would have given him a 0
7Xridrxaaa	Chivas fans shouldnt panic. They are just going through a bad moment. They have the best defense in all of Mexico. Once they get their defensive line working well and Carlos Ochoa is benched (hopefully soon) they will start playing well. I am sorry but Carlos Ochoa is still the worst player in all of Chivas. Everytime i watch him play i want to cry of how bad somebody can play..... Arellano is 5236 times better|`|6uc8ROfWaa	bad streak dude|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Like Rafa said, im not panicked. Yes we have lost the past two games, and two in a row hasnt happend in a while. The last two games, Chivas didnt deserve to loose, of course in this sport is not about who deserves what but who scores, and thats what happend. <br>  <br>  And it has nothing to do with the defence or Magallon or any other defender. Even though I always bash Reynoso, he had a decent game vs. Toluca. And if you see the two goals, uno de tiro d eskina and the other was just a lucky goal. The defense is solid and the midfield is solid, what we are lacking is up front. Ochoa is close to being just another foward thats gonna end up on the bench cause Chicharito is showing just alot more than him, i wouldnt doubt that Ochoa comes out in the bench vs. Morelia.<br>  <br>  But not to worry, im sure Chivas wont loose on saturday and they wont loose in the libertadores next week.....if they do, THEN we see whats up and Efrain could be on his way out. But till then we just need a lil luck on our side...<br>  <br>  CHIVAS 110%|`|Cpm25Pekaa	But didn't Vergaman say you guys had an UNSTOPABLE defence.|`|GDL00jbIaa	coincidence<br>   magallon is there best defense|`|pZdFrAnNaa	its just carlos ochoa and aaron galindo|`|Vctxf6uYaa	no he is just getting his training in<br>  then he will be way better u have to start so when u come <br>  back from an injury and then pick up ur paste,just wait a <br>  while and he will be back to were he was before he got that injury|`|3n87iHqgaa	i think its reynoso and ochoa cuz every goal they make against chivas is reynoso's fault and ochoa has a lot of opportunities but always fails|`|56365ccf12a9d3741995e9c3c1032fdbaa	Dude, it's not Magallon, I agree with Rafa!'s answer...it's Carlos Ochoa, dude.

They still have Shaq, Nash and Jason Richardson.  Those 2 players are good enough to make it to the 9th seed.  The thing is, is that those 3 guys need to step it up.
e4ekb1amaa	The money.<br>  <br>  He reiterated his desire to leave Oakland a few times last year, and I think he knew he'd be franchised if he didn't sign. So right now, he's the highest paid corner in the game, and will be due for free agency again while he's still at a "servicable" age. <br>  <br>  He wants to win, but he realizes he can choose his place to win once he has his money.|`|cdQryr7paa	If the Raiders offered you 45 million for 3 years, would you turn it down?<br>  Especially if you knew you were a lock to start every game?<br>  I doubt he gives a rip if they win or not.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	anybody who signs with the Raiders isnt thinking winning it is all about the benjamins in Oakland|`|wbIEau0qaa	what a joke, they are paying him peyton manning money for running with a wide receiver|`|ur1bnkrZaa	being a fan of the raiders since i was born it disgust me on the decision making of the raiders staff. i understand al davis is a senile old man now but we need some offensive line men and a strong d-line. but we give this huge contract to another db! i am telling you being a raider fan is the most frustrating thing in the world. ha ha next to being a dodger fan.<br>  al davis needs to give up the team and keep his dirty hands out of a game that passed him by about 15 years ago.|`|lNytOKH5aa	Everyone knows the raiders can win but al is stopping them he need to shut up and let the coaches do there jobs and  probably for the money but knowone knows|`|A2G9foewaa	Yeah he signed for the money and I would do the same,  I don't see the Raiders winning any time soon.  Sorry Raider Nation.|`|mTRnOIodaa	For the money everyone knows that the Raiders playoff days are long gone and they won't get back there for a long time.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	$$$$|`|AOA8TJraaa	$$$|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Its all about the $.|`|8eaNfLEOaa	You can't say that he signed entirely for the Raiders, but I think he thinks the Raiders have potential.<br>  <br>  Which they do.  Asomugha is the cornerstone of a very underrated secondary, and they have a ton of young talent on offense.<br>  <br>  Jamarcus Russell is a good fit for their offense, he can throw the deep ball and he can take a hit.<br>  DMC had a down year last year, but he has good vision and has lightning speed, so I see him emerging as a strong RB.<br>  And Zach Miller was a top 8 TE last year as a rookie, and will only continue to get better.<br>  <br>  With that said, I think they will have a good offense.  In fact, I beleive the Raiders had one of the best rushing offenses last year, but it's tough to commit to the run when your defense can't make stops.<br>  <br>  But a year or two of letting the defense mature, and hopefully making smart moves, and the Raiders aren't that far away.<br>  <br>  Besides, they are playing in a division where the winner was only 8-8.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Asomugha is a great shutdown corner. I think AL Davis over spent on him for only three years. To me I would let him go to another team instead of him being a one man show in Oakland. The Raiders need to pull it together if they want to win anything.|`|D0vvJ99aaa	Well for one thing the raiders suck and will not win anytime soon. Second he signed for the money.|`|smFHGStuaa	THE $$$<br>  ... and so would you ! <br>  <br>  40 MIillon for only 1 year with a 2nd year option....

9dba8fd793d11e5dc0acb7b038cbfd7baa	I wouldn't do it if I were you.  The difference in Catcher stats is miniscule, and so the improvement that you get in acquiring Mauer is not offset by the ammount that you give away.  Depending on what other powerhitters you have on your team, I would rather have Fielder than Morneau.  If you feel like the better average/OBP of Morneau would benefit your team, I think that you should take Peavy out of the deal.|`|zbQfEua9aa	It's a good trade but actually I think you are giving a little extra Peavy is a great Pitcher if you want a good pitching squad you would keep Peavey good Luck. By the way I am in a draft today and I have first pick. Have any suggestions on who to take? Just go to my profile click on my questions and answer.<br>  <br>  Thanks!|`|x5AUFn07aa	Well you give up catcher for catcher and first baseman for each other but to give Jake Peavy away as a pitcher what other pitcher are you throwing in to make this even.|`|JQXCdGHYaa	i would do it|`|U5RmNuMfaa	no no no|`|4TN6Erq3aa	Peavy is a monster. He's probably worth both Mauer and J-Morn by himself! Don't be discouraged by the fact he plays in San Diego and wont win much because a win is only 1 stat. He's a 3 stat beast (K's, ERA, WHIP). Mauer is having Kidney problems and J-morn and Fielder are prob a wash (maybe J-Morn gets the edge)|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Not even close. Soto won't match Mauer's average but he will have more HR and RBI. Same goes for Fielder and Morneau, so you're giving up power production plus a top starting pitcher. Pass on this offer.
K2SOMH6iaa	You just need to pace yourself--it's okay if you only run a little bit at first, but gradually you will get stronger, and be able to run faster. If you're running for your health, it doesn't matter how fast you go, just as long as you're running. I can guarantee that if you just pace yourself over a long period of time, it will get better. You kind of need to get a rhythm going. It also helps to stretch a lot first|`|4gZYucHMaa	The key is to start off slowly, get a good shoe for running as they're your key equipment. When I first started I was 20 lbs heavier as well, I couldn't make it a block without dying and walking more than I ran but I just took my time to where I"m a year later doing 6 miles without effort. <br>   Start out with a goal in mind, say ok..today I'm running around the block and do it. If you have to walk do it and just add on gradually. I use google map to measure how far I've gone but it's not always adequate.. I go more for the time I'm out than the actual mile.|`|IAKbseRMaa	Haha, I'm sure that you look great. Just do a little more exercise, and you will look and feel better than ever!<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)
Mzu9bHbmaa	He is a good but not great wrestler. He works best as a babyface because every marks out for his finisher, and his move set is your basic cruiserweight wrestling dives and stuff. As a heel(which he was through most of his time in TNA) he can't get much heat due to his style. On the mic he was decent, but nothing special.<br>  <br>  Over I think TNA dropped the ball on him. A babyface Petey Williams(with his own personality) Vs a heel Alex Shelley feud over the X-Division title would have been great. That's the kind of stuff that TNA use to do well, but they have gone away from the last few years.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	TNA WRESTLING SAYS GOODBYE TO PETEY WILLIAMS<br>  <br>  On Thursday's "iMPACT!", the team of Eric Young and Petey Williams lost to TNA World Tag Team Champions Beer Money, Inc. in the ongoing "Off The Wagon" challenge.<br>  <br>  Williams was pinned in the bout, and as a result of the match stipulations, he is no longer a member of the TNA Wrestling roster.<br>  <br>  Williams first debuted in TNA Wrestling in February 2004 as part of the "Team Canada" faction. Williams claimed two X Division Championship reigns during his TNA career and also earned multiple "Finisher Of The Year" honors for his devastating "Canadian Piledriver".<br>  <br>  TNA Wrestling wishes Petey all the best, as he was respected both in and out of the ring by his peers.<br>  <br>  According to sources, Beer Money, Inc. plan to continue the "Off The Wagon" challenge in the coming weeks.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	It really sucks. <br>  I'm a fan of Petey and it sucks that hes out of TNA for good. DUring the match last night I was rooting for Eric and Petey but I knew that he was out since I read it around last week I think it was or early this week on WrestleZone.|`|TBu2iaPaaa	i don't like tna anymore so  i don't care|`|4V6V9uN8aa	I watched & I was in shock, because if anyone, I would have thought Eric Young would lose & come back as "Super Eric" or something.  Petey leaving is a HUGE loss for TNA's X-Division, but if he is really gone, he would be a GREAT benefit to WWE's lackluster cruiserweight division.  The Canadian Destroyer is too great of a finisher to put on the shelf, Petey could whoop Shelton Benjamin or MVP for the US title or even Jack Swagger or Christian for the ECW title.  Swagger may be bigger, but Petey can out wrestle him with too much ease & like I said, the Destroyer puts anyone down for the three count.  I knew the titles would not change hands as I have seen upcoming "spoilers" for future TNA shows at Pro Wrestling News, but I did not see or read anything on Eric or Petey as being pinned..|`|gVlTlpb2aa	WHO

4Wog48CAaa	i think the best place is probably in Waikiki on the south shore of oahu.  The waves are really mellow and there is a large business in teaching people to surf.  having said that, I definitely would not go there just to learn how to surf.  Maybe ask around for good places to learn near where you live because it reallydoesn't't make too much of a difference.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	well the surfer with the most world titles in history learned to surf in cocoa beach, florida..im not pro but i learned in huntington beach, ca and it worked out pretty well|`|hzxplycYaa	hawaii =) <br>  It's beautiful there also.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Stone Cold vs The Rock vs Triple H vs Mankind in a 3 Stages of Hell Fatal Four Way match.These four Superstars are legends of the Attitude Era and for sure this would be an exciting and well worked match full of nonstop action.<br>  <br>  BQ ~ I read that the WWE storyliners are looking at HBK vs Taker at WM 25, which potentially looks like being one of the highlights of this Wrestlemania.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	BQ first - Koslov.  Though any one of them would make a great opponent for 'Taker, Koslov is the most likely.  Expect hype of 'Taker's streak against Koslov's being undefeated.  'Taker's WM streak is not planned to be broken, but Koslov is also not gonna continue undefeated like WCW did for too long with Goldberg.  The thing is that when a wrestler is allowed to go too long without being beaten, when he finally falls, the fans lose face with the wrestler & things go wrong.  This is what happened when Goldberg lost to Kevin Nash at Starrcade.  After the loss, WCW had trouble selling "Da' Man" & in WWE, it was even worse when he didn't start destroying people as he had been doing in WCW, it made him look weak.  Koslov is good, but unless WWE is planning to make him completely dominant over the roster & it's champion, his undefeated status has to go.<br>  <br>  I would like to take every wrestler on all three rosters & have a "Suicide Tag Team Tournament".  Have the wrestlers in separate locker rooms, have their names in a drum.  Go through the crowd, let a fan pick & announce a superstar.  As he or she enters (mixed tag teams are in this as well..), have another fan pick their partner.  Same for the opposing team.

u2QhQAxzaa	Playing basketball after you just lifted is hard cause your body's muscles will feel so worked that it will be difficult to shoot.  Trust me I have tried it and if you work out ur arms, than they will be weak after you are done. Hit the Court and than the weights.  It is good to get warmed up for the weights anyway with some running.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Basketball first. I can't get the ball to the rim after lifting. LOL.|`|xDDNCKvlaa	Basketball 1st. You won't be able to shoot if you lift 1st.|`|GswnLKtQaa	don't do weight lifting after cardio workout, so gym first before basketball.
Hgm9qaf9aa	Really, they both are.  But Hayden more so.  I watched him just get beat repeatedly.  Andre Johnson abused him, so did Dennis Northcutt of all people.  That's something that I didn't see happen to Asomugha.  He kept Johnson, Steve Smith, even Randy Moss in check.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well Asomugha is obviously more overpaid in terms of the amount of money not the time.  He is the highest paid defensive back in NFL history.  I think he isn't worth that much money because he only has 10 interceptions in his career with the Raiders and only had 1 interception last season.  The Raiders organization will not win games if they continue to throw money at players in an attempt to keep them from jumping ship.  As bad as that franchise is, I don't think its worth staying.|`|jjzK1pOaaa	asomugha...hes on a bad team so obviously he's gonna stand out more and seem better than he really is...|`|rDmlKoRQaa	Calvin Hayden is the more overpaid simply because Asomugha is the best cornerback in the NFL. Hayden is not. <br>  <br>  Asomugha allowed less than 400 yards receiving against him this season which is absurdly good. Andre Johnson had his worst game of the season against Asomugha. He is the new lockdown corner in the NFL.|`|e4ekb1amaa	Easily Hayden.<br>  <br>  Asomugha is the best corner in the league, and he's being paid as such. His price is high, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he is being paid to stay in Oakland, where he won't win, and he really would like to get out of - if it were somewhere that he wanted to be, and he had a shot at playing for a champion, i think it'd cost much less. Of course, if he didn't accept this contract, he would have been franchised for less money, so he kind of was stuck.<br>  <br>  Hayden on the other hand is a decent, but far from great corner. If I could choose between getting Hayden at that contract or Asomugha at his, I wouldn't even flinch. Hayden signed on with one of the best teams in the league, and he was beat bad quite a few times over the past few years. He's decent, but probably not in the top 20 in the league. He is probably the most overpaid corner in the game at the moment (if you discount Dunta Robinson who was franchised).|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Asomugha earned his money. Hayden didn't really deserve that contract but the Colts acted out of the little depth for CB they had.|`|lNytOKH5aa	nnamdi asomugha|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	Hayden gets paid 8.6 mill not counting guaranteed money.<br>  Asomugha gets paid 15 mill and he is a DB and great however getting paid 15 mill is QB kind of money so Asomugha is being overpaid.

xGofrX5Iaa	Yeah, let that soccer player run into the middle of the field and get hit by Ray Lewis, then you will know.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	The problem with football is that therer are so many different body types that you don't have a typical or avergae type to use. A lineman in football has to be athletic in a far different way than a linebacker or a running back does, for example. <br>  <br>  With soccer, it's a little easier to find a typical athlete as there isn't nearly as much specialization in terms of positions. <br>  <br>  Football players would have the advantage in the strength events while the soccer players would have an advantage in the distance events like the 1500 and even the 400.   <br>  <br>  100m: toss up as there are fast dudes in both sports<br>  Long Jump: toss up<br>  Shot Put: football<br>  High Jump: toss up. Both have guys with great vertical leaping ability<br>  400m: soccer. Football players are gasses after a 100 yard run<br>  110m hurdles: toss up<br>  Discuss: probably football<br>  Pole Vault: probably soccer. Most pole vaulters are pretty lanky like most soccer players. <br>  Javelin: toss up<br>  1500m: soccer. They're conditioned to run for 90 minutes. 1500m is nothing<br>  <br>  Going by that, it looks like the soccer player would win out, in my opinion.|`|zCzPnQ2Baa	in my honest opinion i would think a soccer player, although football players may weight lift more and could be strongers but they do a play for like 5 seconds then they stop and start over agian but in soccer they run around the whole time and they only have half time to rest up unless they are taken out for a long time. soccer involves more running and endurance.|`|DyTFo9vJaa	i think a football player would be stronger than a soccer player and depending on what position a football player plays he could be as fast as or slower than a soccer player..that's my input haha|`|kfy8RnI1aa	i really don't no what your on about
Cl6KbcAGaa	you don't need to change your fork for a rigid one you need a lock-out fork see here;<a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25531&subcategory_ID=5231" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> and the difference in a 42 over a 44 tooth chain ring is not all that great get a larger rear cassette 12/28 or larger that will make a difference not in the front. There isn't much to rate here if you get a fork that has a lockout then you just lock it out when you're commuting...nothing to it!|`|Z5xgSATSaa	A rigid fork might help a bit, the bike will lose a bit of weight, but if your current fork has a lockout, you can use this to give you an idea what a rigid fork might feel like. Swapping chainrings gives you a higher high gear, and thus potentially higher speed, but only if you are currently spinning out in your highest gear on flat ground. IF you don't use your highest gear much now, you won't gain any speed with a bigger chainring. Are you using higher pressure road tires on your bike? A set of narrower, slick tires could make more difference than either of the other changes you suggest.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	Your performance will increase a bit with rigid fork, larger chain wheel (as long as you can push the bigger gear) better, thinner tyres etc etc.<br>  <br>  However if you want to really improve your speed and performance, the only positive route you can take is to invest in a good road bike.<br>  <br>  The reason that a rigid fork will help is because it will be lighter and take less effort to propel along the road. The bigger chain wheel will enable the cycle to travel further per crank revolution, as long as you have the power to use the gear.<br>  <br>   Most road bikes are much lighter than a mountain bike and generally use a 52 tooth chain wheel.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A rigid fork will help with the weight and wont suck up any energy.  A 44 tooth chain wont help much unless you are maxed out in the top gear now.  A set of thin tires (slicks)  26x1.5 will help out more then anything just keep the pressure at the high end.  You should see about a 20% improvement with those changes.
8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Dont listen to David S.,  you are 14 and in 10th grade.  You likely have not grown in to your body, nor has your speed likely topped out.   I dont know of many high school sophmores running a 4.4, and if they are, they probably already have Florida and USC barking down their necks.<br>  <br>  I was about 5'9 at 14, and topped out at 6'0 even.   Likely you will probably top out between 5'11 and 6'2, which is a good height for both positions.<br>  <br>  If it was me, Id probably go after safety.<br>  <br>  Why is that?  <br>  <br>  1.  The best athletes normally gravitate, or are pushed, towards playing running back or wide receiver.   Correspondingly, there is tremendous competition at those spots.<br>  <br>  2.  Running backs are one of the most frequently injured players on the field, and face a very small shelf life if you ever make it in to college or even the pros.   There is usually no player on the field who takes as many direct hits as a running back.   Starting pro running backs are tackled between 220-350 times a year (some times even more, especially for backs heavily involved in the passing game0, and hit likely double that or more.   Compare that with the average QB who is tackled maybe 30-40 times (a little more then that for a mobile QB), or a wide receiver, who in most cases, is tackled less then 100.   Its really no contest, running backs are just outright beaten up, and their bodies break down quickly.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  Safety, requires considerably less raw skill.   Yeah, you have to have some speed, but it can be played mostly with aquired attributes, such as strength, and knowledge of the game.   Look at John Lynch.   He had a very long career, and was not a very gifted athlete.  However, he knew his position, played it to the best of his ability, and became a good hitter, and tackler.   Running backs who arent great athletes or lose a step, are benched or quickly fall out of the league, off the team, or are switched to another position.|`|0TAld46gaa	You can play both positions<br>  If you like them both<br>  try out for both|`|2obPKDr0aa	u kinda sound like a running back to me i mean if u juke out the defense alot then they will use u as a running back.<br>  <br>  ask the coach if u can do kick off returns there are good practice for running backs i am a 5'0" and 108lbs and i love running the ball back and it helps to so trust me try it|`|GTWGVq1Vaa	I would go with safety because your 40 time is not up there yet.  Also, you should grow a bit more, I was 5'7 in the 9th grade and im 6'1 now.  Learn to punish people and stick with safety.  Plus there is just too much competition at RB.|`|smFHGStuaa	At age 14 you should be allowed to start as one and play back up role as the other -- just choose a spot and stop pounding your chest about how good your scrawny butt is...|`|OHc3g97Gaa	you should try safety just to see how you like it since you already played running back.
KSSyaEWpaa	It's definately not too late.  18 is young, especially for women in boxing.  Men start out shen they are boys, but women's boxing is relatively new, and most women I've met in boxing started in their 20's.<br>  <br>  Listen to your gut.  If it's telling you to do it, then you absolutely should.  You'll never know until you try, and you'll regret it forever if you don't.   And definately don't listen to what other people say.  You're the only person who can define you as a person.<br>  <br>  It would be extremely beneficial to your self-confidence.  It will make you physically and mentally stronger.  Life is all about fighting.  People don't realize this, but if you want something in life you have to fight for it.  Boxing will make you into a fighter.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	get a boxing training book and go from there|`|u3xmObC4aa	Look you are to young to have lack of self confidence and your probably smart and pretty too. But if you want to start boxing you need to take seriously and dedicate your time to training. I go to boxing gyms very often and the females that box lack a lot of dedication.

I know some great some trainers, aint nothing like having somebody thats knows what the **** their doing.|`|c3c44147fb5ea9cab8adc4f1f6c69124aa	This is the way I see it. Boxing is one of the best all round sports anyone can get into.<br>  First, ask yourself, " What do I want from the sport?"<br>  If it is conditioning and confidence and self defence, then say it like it is to the people around you at the gym.<br>  If it is so you can get rid of your frustration and hit someone then say it like it is. There is always someone handy that would love to beat you up.<br>  Know what you want even if you don't know what to expect.<br>  The Boxers I know are the most helpful and respectful people I have met. There is camaraderie between foes and a willingness to share opinions and dreams and strategy.<br>  If you desire, you will be as fit as you want and can be. You will look better physically and be admired by many. You will walk into any room with confidence.<br>  I say try it out. But take it seriously.It is not for the faint of heart.<br>  If you keep your heart and mind and eyes open, You may be lucky enough to walk in shadow of true champions.<br>  And That is the way I See It.|`|kX8e0ASEaa	Boxing is great for confidence.  Its not to late to get into it at all and the people there are very dedicated and willing to help you (at most gyms).  Just stick with it and don't be thrown off it takes a lot of time and training to get good at it and even the best haven't mastered the sport.<br>  <br>  You will be in the best shape of your life if you stick to it and your self confidence will sky rocket.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	www.boxinggyms.com<br>  <br>  www.womenboxing.com<br>  <br>  www.womensnationalgoldengloves.com<br>  <br>  www.titleboxing.com<br>  <br>  www.rosstraining.com<br>  <br>  good luck

Then attach a main body to that piece. The main body should have 3 legs. The legs should be 2 parted; the bottom half is foldable (like on doors).<br>  <br>  I would also reccomend puting something sharp on the end of the legs that way you can push it into the ground; however get some type of caps so you dont stab yourself while running around.<br>  <br>  <br>  However if you just want a gun stand to put your guns up then I dont know what you should do. Its just nailing wood together to your paintball gun specifications...

They were two (2) racers going for the same spot. Jr. had a run along with the draft. If he would have braked, What do you think would have happened?  Blocking is part of racing. But Jr. coming up along the side of 83 and therefore sending Jr. left and the draft pulling him back to the right. Well everyone seen what happened.  But if you know anything at all about the draft and racing. It happened just like jr. said. He's a real man and not a liar.And he has lots of talent and he is continuing to grow and learn. He just needs some luck too.that's why Nascar did not penalize either, because if they did then they would have had to bothe of them.|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	no i don't. but i do think the same haters on YA who have crucified junior all week for hitting vickers would have 180 degree different opinions on the incident. they'd be crucifying him for blocking while a lap down with 100 laps to go. either way, as far as the haters on here are concerned, the whole thing would have been juniors fault.|`|TYc6nAUsaa	OH MY FRICKEN GOSH!!!!!!!

I would expect people won't pick you up if they have kids in the car, as well.<br>  <br>  When I had a pick-up truck, I picked up hitchhikers more often, even if they looked sketchy. Hard to be a danger to me when you're riding in the BACK of my truck.<br>  <br>  I also pick up hitchhikers near hiking trail crossings, like the Appalachian Trail, if they look like hikers. That's one case where it's OK to be a little stinky and scary-looking...if you're a hiker, you'll understand.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I have to admit, I do think hitch-hikers are a little sketchy. Especially ones that look disheveled or drunk.<br>  <br>  If you struck up a conversation with me in a store or whatever, and I didn't get a hinky feeling from you, I'd be much more likely to offer a ride than if I see you on the side of the road sticking your thumb out.|`|HpBIhbWsaa	Just be clean, polite and freindly.<br>  <br>  Truckers mainly pick up hitchikers more than most motorists.

Until he got in! <br>  Here's a tip.... if you're going to hitch hike - ALWAYS WEAR DEODORANT! That guy stunk! I still gave him the lift.. just kept the window cracked lol... <br>  <br>  The only other time I got weirded out was when one guy opened a can of stuff with a zip lock bag and a pack of ZigZags -- he was just rolling his own tabacco though- <br>  <br>  If I don't pick you up it's because I don't have room - Or i'm only going a few minutes down the street!|`|uBTPq0roaa	Hitch Hikers can be friendly however its that small percent that hitch hike when there on the run from the law that ruin it for the rest of you.<br>  <br>  Personally hitch hiking can be environment friendly because your taking someone who needs to go somewhere and both the driver and hiker are heading in the same direction...

c17x6L4baa	Scalping is normally done at the stadium on game day.  If you want to resell your tickets, like brokers do, for maximum profit, try a multi-pronged attack with ads in the local paper, internet, neighborhood papers, etc, etc. Brokers "sell" tickets at market value.  They don't "pay" market value. Much like collectibles dealers give you 1/2 of what they will try to sell for.<br>  <br>  Wait until a time period you decide before the season, but, early enough to give a decent sale period in all your marketing areas.

VFdC2wPlaa	If your taking it through red cross, then you need Bronze Medallion, and Bronze Cross courses. You will also need to take NLS. If your interested in teaching lessons as well as life guarding then you should take your AWSI (assistant water safety instructor) and WSI (water safety instructor). Usually you can find courses that are offered in your area by going on your city/towns website.|`|dYN3bdnKaa	My sister looked online for some lifegaurd classes in our area,<br>  and found some. The classes that she took costed 90 dollars,<br>  BUT..at any point if your not good enough, they kick you out, not<br>  money back.<br>  <br>  You need to know all the swims well (freestyle, breast stroke, (and one<br>  more..I forgot the name of it though) those are the most important)<br>  you need to have a strong kick too.<br>  <br>  but yea, just look some up on google, lifeguard classes, or lifeguard<br>  training and you'll find some.<br>  <br>  I really wanted to be a lifeguard also, bc sometimes they make really<br>  good money! (my sister made like $4000 in one summer..and a really<br>  nice tan)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|c0342d26192961a8e86c337c0610b25aaa	Check out your local Red Cross for training or any Municipal Pool.

I would call your local YMCA and ask them since I know a lot of Y's that offer lifeguard classes. Also ask aquatic centers, they can give you information. I think that Red Cross might have a lifeguard class search online but I'm not for sure|`|dTBBihxQaa	Do you have a civic center in your area.. If so they should offer classes.. or you can contact the American Red Cross.. Those are just a few choices that you have..I went through both.. Are both decently cheap..|`|zwkv4A3Eaa	If you take your courses through the red cross, you can be done all of them is about a year.<br>  <br>  First you need to have been done the higest swimming levle.<br>  <br>  Ove you've compleated that you can join the Bronzes. Ther are three in total. Bronze Star, Bronze, Medallion, and Braoze Cross.<br>  You only need Medallion and Cross but having your Star will help you with the other two.<br>  <br>  Wher you are done thoses you need your SFA (standard First aid)<br>  This is a review corse for all the medical things you have learned. There is no swimming involved.<br>  <br>  From there You need LSI (life saving instructor), and NLS ((national Lifesaving). theese are both life saving cources that teach you all the preceidures.<br>  <br>  after that you are legally allow to supervivse swimmers. but most pools wont hire you unless you can teach swimming lessons as well.<br>  <br>  To teach you need to take AWSI (assistant water safty instructor) and WSI (Water safty instructor) they both teach you the bacics about teaching swimmers. They both require very little swimming.<br>  <br>  To get any information on theese go to the red cross website<br>  <a href="http://www.redcross.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redcross.org/</a><br>  <br>  or you can contact the Life Savving Society.<br>  <br>  Try calling your local pool.

rDmlKoRQaa	No way will they draft Harvin unless he falls way down the boards to the third round. They already have a young Harvin type player in Devin Hester who they just signed to a fairly large contract. <br>  <br>  I disagree with Guru -- this is a good WR class. Its probably the second deepest position (behind OT) with names like Crabtree, Maclin, Hakeem Nicks, Kenny Britt, Percy Harvin, Darius Hayward-Bey, and Derrick Williams who could all go in the first two rounds. <br>  <br>  Ideally the Bears would take Maclin, but the possibility to trade down for more picks and take Nicks, Hayward-Bey, or Harvin a bit later also exists.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	My bears will draft another offensive tackle. and hope that williams can play from last year.  That way they can have book end tackles.|`|smFHGStuaa	Sanchez if he falls -- otherwise they will go O-line <br>  <br>  Your mdiocre RT is retiring...|`|6AfM6SWaaa	They need a quarterback.,.  I would try to sign Matt Cassel from the Pats.  Big bucks but worth it.|`|om5MsOMmaa	I think they need a DB to add to there defense.|`|8eaNfLEOaa	You would expect the Bears to take a WR in the first round of the draft, but the truth is that there is a thin stock of WR to draft this year.<br>  If the Bears want to add depth there, they should attack it through free agency.<br>  <br>  With that said, I think they will go for a defensive end (Tyson Jackson, maybe Larry English).  They are a defensive oriented team and they had a weak pass rush last year.  I think adding a strong, fast, young defensive end can fill a gap on the outside rush.<br>  <br>  I know they are lacking big playmakers on offense, so a WR such as Percy Harvin or Darrius Heyward-Bey would be ideal.<br>  Their offensive line is also on the decline, so that may also be a priority.<br>  <br>  But the Bears have been and will continue to be a defensive minded team, and I think Larry English will be their guy.|`|D0vvJ99aaa	I would throw up if they pick Harvin. There are too many better players that will still be on the board. Michael Johnson is freak of the edge or DHB.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	Harvin if Maclin isnt available
AA11729094	I haven't seen 30-30 ammo for 6 bucks a box in 3 years! If you don't buy it, I WILL! Flatpoint for 30-30 is fairly common, it's a great hunting cartridge, more deer have been harvested with 30-30 than any other caliber. If you don't buy it, please contact me with where you found it, I will buy all of it. Thanks.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	I will answer part of your question........ $6 for a box of 30/30? -- Are you nuts? --BUY IT!!!<br>  <br>  If you have several boxes available at that price you could buy it all and sell it for double to triple what you paid for it on gunbroker......|`|h2KkiKK3aa	OH YES!!!!! <br>  where you getting them, I wanna buy some!<br>  their never that low, ever, you need flat points for lever actions so they don't set off the other ones in the tube magazine.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	As everybody has said, it is a great price.  If it is soft point, not a full metal jacket, it is hunting ammunition, and can be used for deer, or anything else you use a .30-30 on.  Some people prefer the 170 grain loads because they have more mass.  Some prefer the extra velocity of the 150 grain loads.  I like the 150s myself.  I have never had a deer walk away from them.<br>  <br>  The reason for the flat nose is because many (most) .30-30 rifles have a tubular magazine under the barrel.  By using a flat point, you don't have to worry about the tip of one bullet in the magazine setting off the primer of the bullet in front of it when the gun recoils during firing.  That would be a bad thing.  The flat point has some problems with drag, and it is not nearly as accurate at long ranges.  But since the .30-30 is usually considered a 200 yard or less cartridge, the point is moot.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	WOW!! You bet your Life it is.*~~ The last box I just bought cost me between $15.00 and $17.00 Dollars at Walmart.* The 170 grain bullet shoots best and performs best in the 30-30.* The 150 grain is A-OK to use.*|`|itiLu3dRaa	Yeah, good deal. Use flat points in tube feed weapons like the Winchester 94 or else things may go BOOM when you really don't want them to.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	That is a great price I do not shoot 30-30 but six bucks a box for "30 caliber anything" is a great deal nowadays.  You should stock up as much as you can at that price.  150 grain flatpoint is the standard 30-30 round.<br>  <br>  Flatpoints do have more knockdown power because they flatten out more and do not over-penetrate which is good for the range that a  30-30 shoots best which is shorter than .30-06 for example.|`|lB6J3qFAaa	Great price, buy as much as you can.

RjUWPz5daa	The article below mentions all of these calibers and their uses.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	The pistols would differ in size, since the cartridges in these calibers are progressively smaller dimensionally as you list them.  A .45 semi-auto pistol would be wider than a similar 9mm of the same manufacturer.  A .44 semi-auto pistol would be longer and heavier than the .45.  The method of lock up (how the chamber is held closed when firing) would be different for the .44 semi-auto as it generates higher pressure than the .45.  Magnum Research is your one-stop shop to look over all three calibers as head to head as possible.<br>  When revolvers are compared, the differences between the 9mm and .45ACP are not externally apparent.  Both cartridges require clips to hold them in the revolver's cylinder due to their rimless cases.  The rimmed .45 and .44 cartridges were designed for revolvers in the first place.  Both .44 and .45 caliber cartridges come in heavy magnum flavors.  These require large framed, heavy revolvers to handle the high pressures they generate.|`|AA11640949	You would have to offer specific models for us to answer what the differences in the pistols are.  Normally the 9mm and .45 are offered in semi-automatic pistols, while the .44mag is in revolvers (or wheel gun).<br>  <br>  In some cases for the 9mm and the .45, the only difference is the caliber.  You can buy more than one model of pistol that is exactly the same except for the caliber it is offered in.  Actually, I take that back.  Usually the 9mm version will hold about 3 round more than the .45 version of the same pistol model.|`|lrVSk62yaa	9mm is a pistol cartridge and is the smallest of the three. A .44 is a magnum cartridge.  it is a hefty round.  A .45 comes in 3 different types .45 acp and gap for pistols and .45 long Colt for single action revolvers.|`|DYoyrsT3aa	the difference is in the size of the bullet and the amount of gunpowder. a 44 is bigger than a 9mm and a 45 is bigger than a 45.|`|hyyBy2ofaa	The size of bullet that it shoots. Ex the 9mm shoots a 9mm bullet|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	those are all calibres, or the diameter of the bores  ( inside the barrel) In addition the 45 (.45 inch) and 9mm are both automatic pistols while the 44 (.44 inch) is traditionally a revolver.<br>  <br>  in order of "size" it would go 9mm, 45 then 44. Although .45 inches is larger than .44 inches the 44 has a larger cartridge and more gun powder behind it.|`|tuULGJS6aa	These are diameters of bullets. A 9mm Luger uses a .354" bullet; .44 Special uses a .429" bullet; .45ACP uses a .452" bullet: and .45 Colt uses a .454" bullet. A .429" is 10.9mm; and .452 is 11.5mm. There are several loads for any given caliber, e.g. 9mm Kurz, 9mm Ultra, 9mm Makarov, 9mm Luger or Parabellum, 9mm Steyr, 9mm Mauser, etc. The .44 Russian was developed by S&W when it got a contract to make military revolvers for Russia in the 1870s. Later, a longer version of the .44 Russian was developed and called .44 Special. In 1956, a hot .44 Special in a slightly longer case was introduced and called .44 Magnum. These are all revolver cartridges. The .45 Colt was the cartridge used in the Colt "Single-Action Army Metallic Cartridge Revolver", nicknamed "Peacemaker", and adopted by the US Army in 1871. A shorter version was developed for S&W "Schofield" revolvers, so the original is often clled .45 Long Colt. The .45 ACP is a rimless cartridge for semi-autos and used in the Colt pistol adopted by the US Army in 1911 and used until 1985. The 9mm shells listed are all for European semi-autos.
Fp40wHSraa	Are Viper Cues any Good?  Well compared to a broom handle the answer is yes.  Compared to other possible choices in Cues, No.  The first thing to consider is your new price range.  If you're going to Spend $50.00 you may as well spend $100.00 because the difference between a $50.00 and a $75.00 cue is marginal at best.  Without knowing what you are wanting to spend I would say that buying a used cue will allow you to stretch your dollar a bit.  At $100 dollars you could probably get a used McDermott or a used Lucasi (for $125 you could get a new Lucasi from me.)  Better to buy used in good condition as any cue you buy will be used anyway after you start playing it.  The differences between a Viper and say a McDermott of Lucasi if not so much in appearance as it is in material and Craftsmanship.  Viper uses inexpensive wood and most of their design graphics are decals.  Higher end cues use inlays and higher grade woods.  Good wood will make a huge difference as to the feel and control of each shot.  And it may sound silly but one of the main things ANY cue you buy needs is a quality tip.  Good tips can run as high as $20 to $30 to have put on your cue.  So if you are getting a cue in the $50 range you can be assured the tip will probably be the cheapest out there.  Later on, when you have progressed a bit and are ready to upgrade to a Pechauer, Joss, Schon or maybe a custom Cue you will probably have a better understanding of what characteristics you are looking for.  Hope this answer helps.  Don't get a Viper!!!:P If you have any other questions you feel I can help with leave your e-mail in your reply.|`|MHo2SGPRaa	I dont know but I have been using a Fury Cue DL model. You can buy one for about 95.00 at the right place. So for so good for me. My friend had a Lacasi ( higer priced) and loved my cue. From what I understand they both have a similiar "hit". This been the lower model Lucasi. I found that cue to be a bit more "airy" softer than my cue. I hear Schmelke makes a good cue for about $110.00. I have never play with one though myself. Again I am a begginer and dont know all the technical mumbo jumbo. Although I have been reading about it somewhat lately..Good luck..

mMFJrPbvaa	Its all leg muscles...why do you think MLB pitchers practically fall off the mound or some of the best pitchers have high leg kicks?  They drive the ball to the plate.  Why do you think pitchers run a lot and do leg presses?  Have you ever seen a pitcher with massive arms and tiny legs? You have to drive off the rubber using your legs, the muscles are much bigger and efficient. Stand flat footed and throw hard and then drive off the rubber..you`ll see which is more efficient.  Best thing to do is run and work your legs, of course your arms too but focus on legs.  Ask any pitcher...college , high school, or pro what workout do they do the most and they`ll say running.  Mainly to work the legs, pitchers dont necessarily need cardio work, they wont be sprinting or running during the game.

Need to go continue this another time or at 6 30am if you are awake. Cheers|`|ePFdhsCYaa	The transfer market is not too kind to scottish clubs at the moment as we are simply priced out by a scale we couldn't possibly compete with.

We will win 2-1 at the lane.... Spurs to go out.... Very disappointed... He has already stated he is gonna play four youth team players..... He better know what he is doing|`|GA4mp1I2aa	Obvious answer no. they under-performed against a worse team so they have to really try to grind out a result but looking at their earlier performances i doubt that will happen. Spurs should not attempt to get far in the UEFA cup because i'm not sure they would be eligible to play in next years tournament because relegation beckons to the Coca Coca Championship...|`|TKDi70uTaa	no.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Possibly , although it will take a good Performance . I don't know what Harry was thinking last night . They should juts concentrate  on the league though , survival is the main priority . Kopette probably has a life .|`|KTxxd700aa	Harry's right, the UEFA cup isn't a priority this season, though why not start with both Bent and Campbell idk, it amazes me how many average players Spurs have, nearly 3 teams worth|`|efGx6z3vaa	even if they pass through, do you personally think they would win, Schalke 04, Ac Milan or Fiorentina|`|tfotPdeZaa	Well sure we have a chance of getting through, but it depends on the team Harry is going to put up.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	theres more chance that tw@t gomes will catch the friggn ball

They are vulnerable, especially with an off-shooting night from LeBron.<br>  <br>  Coach Doc Rivers still has his Celtics team playing strong defense, and with a healthy big 3, they are my pick and have been from season's start, to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals.<br>  <br>  (Bold prediction: Rajon Rondo becomes more of a scoring threat by season's end)|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Cleveland Cavaliers<br>  otu of all the "elite" teams in the east this team has the most experience in the playoffs together and has been the best defense in the playoffs for a while now<br>  last year we were a couple possesions short in game 7,this year we will get at least 10+ wins and the addition of mo williams will gove the cavs the boost they need,plus the celtics got rid of players such as cassel,PJ,and james posey(best defender)<br>  and lets not forget lebron......|`|qq1fSV2daa	The Cavs .. the reason is because of their defense .. they match up well against Boston and Orlando.. and they have King James .. and he's going to have a great playoff run .. but he also has a very good supporting cast .. Mo Williams will provide another dangerous scoring threat and passer .. so i believe it will be Cleveland in the Finals for the East .. although i can't see them winning more then 2 games against the Lakers.|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	The Cleveland Cavaliers.|`|GoYT6SIHaa	I think it would be between the CAvs, Magic, or Celtics, those are the teams that would project because celtics jus loss kevin garnett and there gonna be in third place. magic just acquired rafer alson and they will really help their bench when jameer nelson comes back. cavs are really looking good right now, so i think the cavs will represent the eastern conference|`|AA10863855	I'd say the Cavs.  With KG out, I think the Cavs will be 1st seed in the east.  They will have home court advantage through the Eastern Conference playoffs.  They haven't been beaten by an Eastern Conference team at home(only loss to Lakers).  The Magics are too inconsistent.  Boston, even if healthy, are 1-4 vs LA, Cleveland, and SA.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	Cleveland- With Garnet injured and he gets an MRI today to see the extent of it, Cleveland has one of the best defenses in the league and when u have a guy like leBron on your team then you are never out of a game or a series.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	The Celtics because the Cavs don't have the players to beat the Celtics besides LeBron and the Celtics have more experience.|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	The Celtics or the Magic.

The article above illustrates my findings.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Haven't heard the Cabrera rumor yet, but I would think not, unless he wants to play 2nd or they move Furcal over to 2nd. <br>  <br>  As for Hudson, the last I heard, was if they didn't sign Manny they were going to take that money and try and sign him and Dunn, but since Dunn is off the market, I'm sure they don't want to spend too much on 2B since they need all of their money for Manny. After Abreu signed a $5mil contract with the Angels, they may be able to get Hudson for $3-4 mil since I don't think he has much other interest.<br>  <br>  <br>  *there is no trading involved, they are both free agents.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	Hudson should give AZ one more shot!  He's been injured at the end of the past two seasons and it's been a real bummer on az fans ! <br>   I think he is an outstanding offensive player and also a great team player, he always looks happy to be playing with every one, even the opposing players, and he always takes responsibility for his goof ups..although I think he defense is highly overrated, when he does make a great play, it's a really great play!<br>  <br>  Orlando cabrera can go to the dodgers! he didn't help the white sox last year in the playoffs at all..he just made them look dumb with that little outburst against the aussie who talks to himself!|`|5IOeWcOxaa	Obviously by the time you read this you would have already heard that Orlando Hudson just signed a 1 year deal for 3 million dollars with the Dodgers.  He is a Dodger now and thats final.  A good move too by Los Angeles because not only did they get a terrific player for CHEAP but they still got plenty of money to go after Manny Ramirez.<br>  <br>  If they got Manny, then that lineup with Furcal, Hudson, Manny, Loney, Kemp, Martin, and Blake would surely win the N.L West.<br>  <br>  But thats not all, they need at least one more pitcher and there just isn't any out there anymore.  My guess is that if they sign Manny, they will trade DeWitt and Pierre along with some other younger guys that they don't need anymore and some draft picks or money and trade for Jake Peavy.<br>  <br>  If this happens then the Dodgers will pretty much wind up in the World Series.  But lets see, Baseball is a funny sport.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	They still are going after Hudson but in my opinion if they are trading for Cabera the Dodgers are probably gong to trade Dewitt .But if they are trading for orlando Hudson they might trade 2 minor league pitchers or 1 minor leauge hitting prospect.|`|LbJqU82waa	it will not hel pthem bums!!|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Teh Dodgers have signed O-Dogg. This will probably push DeWitt out of second base as Hudson will become the everyday second baseman. Blake might move to left for DeWitt to play third, but if Manny signs...things get complicated. And yeah I like the Hudson signing because Furcal already mans SS
qVDY1hm5aa	I really hope Tyson Kidd becomes a big superstar in the future. His in-ring skills by the looks of things are good, he's got a nice gimmick and although WWE hasn't let him have much mic. time, if he succeeds with that, then WWE definitely need to push him. The only downside is I think it's not the sort of look Vince likes. Short and light. If he doesn't get pushed because of his weight and height, then WWE are missing out on a big star. If it doesn't work out for him in WWE then I think he should jump ships to TNA.<br>  <br>  WQ: I love his flying elbow. I think he peforms that elbow to perfection and the height he get's is amazing. I also love the hangtime he get's whilst in mid-air. Really cool finisher.<br>  <br>  WQ 2: I'm crossing my fingers on this one. I think if WWE pushes him the right way and give him enough credinility then Kidd could be a big star later on in his career. Similar to that of CM Punk, he could gain popularity/heat on ECw then get drafted to RAW and win the big one.|`|UbUSth5haa	Absolutely not the equivalent of a Shawn Michaels, but I see him being a rising star, and maybe even his real-life girlfriend Natayla.|`|e7zRqsIyaa	he will never be as good as HBK or Y2J, but i think he will be big|`|TBu2iaPaaa	yes|`|qNHMcRL4aa	I personally think it is too early to decide if some1 is going to be a star in the future. he definitely has the talent and therefore potential but a few matches on ecw isn't enough. have to wait , if they think he has real talent e will be part of the draft in april and be given a bigger push, if he responds well to the push eg. he deals with the pressure well on screen and backstage, he improves and progresses at the level they expect, he keeps clear o any wellness policy violations and gets a good reaction from the crowd.<br>  <br>  I dont know if anyone can be a new chris jericho or shawn michaels, even if he becomes as successful in all aspects he still wouldn't be either of them, if everyone starts to compare him to them and people who are as successful and talented as them he will not do well, look at chavo guerro, every1 expects him to be amazing because of eddie and he has been effected by that because he is not him.<br>  <br>  I am not sure whether he could be a world champion 1 day. its hard to tell from a few atches but there are alot of talented people that will be main eventing , some still from today so he will definatley need to improve to get to the top. At the moment can you imagine him successfuly competing with the likes of edge, christian, jeff hardy, matt hardy, mark henry, shawn michaels, chris jericho or cena?|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Tyson Kidd has all the potential to be developed into one of the greatest stars in today's wrestling. I haven't seen him much on the mic, but if he excels there as he does in the ring, I can't wait for a belt to get strapped on him and see how well he can do with it. <br>  WQ: I think his finisher is great, the elbow gets lots of air and impact. <br>  WQ2: If Vince sees the potential that he obviously has, he could be a great world champion. I don't think it will be any time this year, the earliest, from what I see is mid - 2010 but he will do great on his way to the championship and upon receiving it.

For one, look at Chester Taylor compared to year's pasts of Mewelde Moore, Michael Bennett (save one season) and Ciatrick Fason?  Granted, Taylor may be better but he has never carried a full workload which has limited his stamina thus far and he's suffering from fatigue.

77c248e410ea5847944648026da2077baa	2003-04 formula<br>  The BCS formula calculated the top 25 teams in poll format. After combining a number of factors, a final point total was created and the teams received the 25 lowest scores were ranked in descending order. The factors were:<br>  <br>  Poll average: Both the AP and ESPN-USA Today coaches polls were averaged to make a number which is the poll average. <br>  Computer average: An average of the rankings of a team in seven different computer polls were gathered, with the poll in which the team was lowest ranked being dropped. This created the computer average. <br>  Strength of Schedule: This was the team's NCAA rank in strength of schedule divided by 25. A teams strength of schedule was calculated by win/loss record of opponents (66.6%) and cumulative win/loss record of team's opponents (33.3%). The team who played the toughest schedule was given .04 points, second toughest .08 points, and so on. <br>  Losses: One point was added for every loss the team has suffered during the season. <br>  Quality win component: If a team beat a team which was in the top 10 in the BCS standings, a range of 1 to .1 points was subtracted from their total. Beating the #1 ranked team resulted in a subtraction of 1 point (remember, losing points was a good thing), beating the #2 team resulted in a deduction of .9 points, and so on. Beating the #10 ranked team would have resulted in a deduction of .1 points. A team would only be awarded for a quality win once if it beat a Top 10 team more than once (such as in the regular season and a conference championship game), and quality wins were determined using a team's current ranking, not the ranking when the game was played. <br>  A team's poll average, computer average, strength of schedule points, and losses were added to create a subtotal. The subtotal ranks were used to determine quality win deductions to create a team's final score.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] 2004-05 formula<br>  AP Poll: A team's AP Poll number is the percentage of the possible points it could receive in the poll. As an example, in the final regular-season poll of 2003, LSU received a total of 1,580 out of a possible 1,625 points from the voters, giving them an AP Poll percentage of 97.2. <br>  Coaches' Poll: This is calculated in the same manner as the AP Poll number. For LSU, their final regular-season number in this poll would have been 96.3 (1,516 out of 1,575 possible points). <br>  Computer Average: The BCS now uses six computer rating systems (Anderson-Hester, Billingsley, Colley, Massey[2], Sagarin, and Wolfe) (See here for more information about each computer system: [3]), dropping the highest and lowest ranking for each team. Then, it will give a team 25 points for a Number 1 ranking in an individual system, 24 points for Number 2, and so on down to 1 point. Each team's set of numbers is then added, conveniently making the number compatible with the percentages from the two polls. For USC, dropping their highest and lowest computer rankings would have left them with four third-place finishes, worth 23 points each for a total of 92, while LSU would have had four second-place finishes for a total of 96. The BCS averaged the three numbers obtained above, divided the result by 100, and converted it to a decimal fraction. This formula made it highly unlikely that the top team in both human polls would be denied a place in the title game, as it happened in 2003-04. <br>  <br>  [edit] 2005-06 formula<br>  The BCS formula for 2005-06 was the same as in the 04-05, except that the Harris Interactive College Football Poll replaced the AP poll. [4] [5] The Harris Interactive College Football Poll's current maximum point value is 2,850.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] 2006-07 formula<br>  There was no change to the formula for this season.|`|34f018994782f51ef0aa0e23eb7b4988aa	Its not just by how many points they put up....it is a factor in the overcomplicated BCS ranking system.|`|AA10785898	The BCS formula takes into acccount human polls, strength of schedule, and margin of victory among other things.<br>  <br>  The margin of victory is not as profound an influence as it once was.  It was tweaked to make it less important for teams to annihilate lesser opponents.  Still, the BCS considers margin of victory over a team as a valuable indicator of overall strength.  <br>  <br>  If USC crushes one team by 38, and another ranked team squeaks by thr same team by 2, it influences the overall ranking, albeit slightly.|`|137a698a555d34ca2f99b9ebb88d1ec6aa	the BCS is all opinionated and thats apparently all that matters|`|987c8a8212077d92b7e0ae6f622ff63baa	There are several different college football polls.<br>  <br>  AP - Associated Press is a poll of sports writers<br>  USA Today - is a poll of all 63 Div I college coaches<br>  Harris Interactive - 114 former college administrators, coaches, players and media<br>  Multiple Computer Polls<br>  <br>  The "human" polls are done by each voter ranking the teams by how good they think teams are compared to the other teams.  Typically, wins/losses, conference and opponents are taken into consideration.  High scores shouldn't influence voters, but sometimes they do.<br>  <br>  The computer polls rank teams by a mathmatical/statistical formula.  Each computer poll uses a different formula.  Score isn't a factor.<br>  <br>  The BCS poll is an average of the USA Today, Harris and an average of 6 computer polls.

This is where you make your knee touch the ground when you step forward.  Walk from the goal line to the 50 yard line doing this.   To explain, put your right foot forward, then lower your left knee to the ground, raise knee step forward and repeat.  This is great for building up the power in your legs.  <br>  <br>  Another exercise is to run, stopping once and a while to do push ups and then sprint.  <br>  Start at the goal line jog 20 yards, drop, do 20 push-ups then sprint 20 yards, 20 push ups, then jog.  Change the intervals, to fit your needs.<br>  <br>  Get a buddy to train with.  It is easier when someone is there to motivate you. <br>  <br>  Go to the gym and ask what some good weight lifting exercises are.  <br>  <br>  When you are watching TV when a commercial comes on do sit-ups/ push ups.  <br>  <br>  Good luck
7PbJWEo1aa	Breast Stroke is the low impact entry position for toning up and to get you back into it. I would just stick to breast stroke until you feel you can progress to butterfly.|`|eVubSKcEaa	As from my experience, you can try either breast-stroke or butterfly stroke.. I think butterfly stroke will help you better...<br>  and if you really want to see results i recommend you swim daily or week days.. you will feel dead tired the 7 to 14 days.. but later you will build great stamina.. try to get help from an experienced coach.. he will be of help.. please dont quit if you get tired.. getting tired is natural. but once you start building stamina, you will be amazed with the results.. swimming is really a great exercise...|`|XTN6ZH2Paa	Breast stroke is toning and relaxing, and is good for warming up. After a few laps of that, try a 100 IM. To work on your stomach and back muscles, try a few laps of butterfly.|`|S2XWGJhDaa	Use the butterfly stroke if you are a strong swimmer....Max calories are lost through this stroke...The breast stroke is a good recreational stroke which relaxes, doesn't strain too much and tones.|`|HqQCgrAoaa	just swim daily in a pool do some laps dat would help :)

Bring balance back to the FORCE!!!!|`|b8d109bf74b66a96eb09f3e5f417f988aa	Yeah Brent got this one right. If you have 15 teams in each league, then either one team doesn't play every day or there's always an interleague matchup going on, and you can't do that because it would screw up the entire schedule. If the AL added two teams, that would solve the problem, but where would you put them? As it is, not enough teams have good starting pitchers; adding two more teams to the fray would make team's rosters even thinner for pitching. The only real way to fix the problem would be to get rid of two teams. Okay, so who? The Expos were a good solution but they're just rebuilding a fan base and are spending money on a stadium, you can't kill that team. The Marlins have won two World Series titles in 10 years, so scrap that plan. The Twins were always a popular pick but now they're contending for a playoff spot.<br>  <br>  By the way, just to correct your original question, both wests do not have four and both centrals do not have six. The AL West has four teams, but the AL Central has five (14 total in the AL). In the NL, the West has five and the Central has six (16 total in the NL).<br>  <br>  AL West - Oakland, Anaheim, Texas, Seattle<br>  AL Central - Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Minnesota, Kansas City<br>  <br>  NL West - San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Colorado, Arizona.<br>  NL Central - St. Louis, Chicago, Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Milwaukee.|`|0f67622db99c42ecc19c0a3522e44d16aa	They should but they can't with the current scheduling format.

No offense to some teams but seriously it is unfortunate that Arizona and Florida bought championships. They both should be gone. Tampa Bay and Colorado should be the next to go. Move Milwaukee back to the American League where it belongs.  Then make a rule for the DL in both leagues.  Now realigning the divisions is not too simple.

cKl8ZSrSaa	He's for sure one of my favorites. I liked him ever since he was on Hendrick's team. He kinda left out similar to Kyle and I like him even better now that he drives a Toyota.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	I've never cared for him, it has nothing to do with the 'dega or daytona wrecks. I hope Scott Speed has a better season than Vickers. Brian is a okay driver, he had his chances at HMS, but I do not see him going down as one of the greats for sure.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms    &    GO ELLIOTT!!!!!|`|XNdDrXAzaa	He needs to focus on what's going on in front of him, and not worry about who is in the faster car, or he will never win a race. I'm not hating on the guy, i'm just pointing out the obvious.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I like Vickers, he is a fellow Tar Heel and very talented..................the incident between him and Jr was unfortunate.|`|U55Q6zV5aa	He is a better driver than he gets credit for. I wouldn't be completely shocked if he sneaks into the chase this year. He is getting heat from fans about daytona even though it was more juniors fault. Junior could turn around and drive backwards and hit someone head on, and junior nation would come up with some reason why it isn't jr's fault.|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	CAN'T STAND HIM!!  Can't stand to hear his voice or see his face!!  I didn't like him when he was with Hendrick, was glad to see him leave.  What really torn it for me and was the final straw was when he wrecked Johnson into Jr. to get his first win.  There was no way he was going to get by either of them for a 2nd place finish, let alone a win.  But he WRECKED Jimmie into Jr. to steal the win.  NASCAR should have fined him and disallowed that as far as I'm concerned.  The fact that he's been a sorry driver since then just cements my opinion that he sucks all the way around and I was correct in assuming his character!|`|TYc6nAUsaa	I think he'll do great in the 83 car this year. But if you're talking about the 500, he made a bad judgement, but the crash wasn't really his fault. I don't blame Jr or Vickers. Though Vickers has wrecked someone for almost all his wins (an All-Star race and that Talladega race he 'won'), I don't hate him. But dude, "logical thinker", Dale Jr doesn't need to "man up". He's one of those people who tells the truth no matter what he says, you can trust him.<br>  Kyle Busch is the "Golden Boy" / "NASCAR's poster child"|`|MCWdcrpraa	He is not bad, but if someone should have been let go from Red Bull Racing, it should not have been A.J. Brian has had his chance when he was with Hendrick and could only manage 1 win. I think he is over rated and kind of a cry baby. To be honest NASCAR has become a crybaby sport. Do you think if Dale Sr. would have spun out someone 15 years ago like Jr. did last week, would anybody cried about it.|`|sluDVLQ1aa	I like Vickers,  I think he is a pretty good driver.  Has the chance to be a pretty successful driver.  It was just one of those racing deals at the 500.  Going for the lucky dog and not sure how the race was going to pan out because of the weather.  The only problem was he wrecked the "Golden Boy".  It is sad that Jr. couldn't man up and admit he did something stupid by causing the big one the way he did.|`|47UZoc4vaa	No, I do not like him. And it has nothing to do with what happened last week. I never have liked him.|`|ozRUw6HUaa	Better driver then he gets credit for, and not his fault in the 500.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I think he honestly didn't know that if he stuck his nose out from behind Jimmies car, without a head of steam, the air would move him back into Jimmie.. Causing the wreck at Talladega... That doesn't make him a bad person... It just makes him a person that doesn't belong driving on a Super Speedway.. Also, when someone chases a car off the racing surface at Martinsville, it's a bad thing to do, but it's racing.. At Daytona, it not racing, it's something else..|`|7RUMbREoaa	Vickers is a pretty good driver but can be an idiot at times(a prime example being the last lap of the 2006 UAW Ford 500 @Talladega).I neither like nor dislike him.He is one of the drivers that I would not miss if he quit racing or lost his ride,though.

1eaff7a9eadd6660f6902fe60cfb6adaaa	I think they will finish third in the SEC East with losses to Florida, Georgia, and LSU (and maybe even an upset by South Carolina led by Coach Spurrier).<br>  <br>  Florida is the best team in the SEC East this season, but they also have the toughest schedule (playing the top 3 SEC West teams: LSU, Auburn, Alabama), so Georgia may have a chance since they are only playing one difficult SEC West team (Auburn).  <br>  <br>  The SEC West division winner is going to be either Auburn or LSU, which is pretty obvious.<br>  <br>  My prediction:  Florida vs. Auburn in the SEC championship.  Florida will win if QB Chris Leak is able to adjust to Coach Meyer's offensive system and if they can produce a decent running game (if Wynn, Moore, or Manson has a successful season).  Injuries are another factor that could determine the outcome of this game.|`|AA10613733	i dont know, im in the middle.|`|AA12037424	They will finish third in the East and go to the Peach Bowl.

dDhTMacAaa	Very possible.<br>  <br>  Charlotte Bobcats has unrightfully left it's fans waiting for too long and the team needs a boost, and a post-season appearence would be incredible for the franchise.<br>  <br>  THey have made some good moves lately and they have a nice set of players.

In the East, every team is either fighting for the #1 seed (Celtics, Cavs, Magic), or fighting for playoff positioning, which is every other team except the Wizards who are not mathematically eliminated yet, but are realistically out of it considering they're still quite a few games behind the next worst team.|`|GswnLKtQaa	there is a chance right now bulls, bobcats, bucks and nets are fighting for the 8th spot, if the bobcats stay healthy and play well they can really end up with the 8th seed in the east.

eDlxp0n2aa	runnersworld.com can give u a good training program. as for shoes get what feels comfortable for u. and if ur flat foot get ones with built in high arches|`|ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	You're in a great position to train yourself well for your first of what could be many marathons. <br>  <br>  Shoes - I suggest RoadRunnerSports' Shoe Dog service.  You enter what your feet look like, and it spits out several recommendations.  This takes into account your gait, speed, size and goals.  <br>  <br>  Base - For now, work on building a base of running.  You'll want to run 3-4 times a week, totaling at least 20 miles.  Increase slowly - no more than 10% a week.  Throw in some races and stuff, just fun and to show that you are on your way!<br>  <br>  Training - You can find a  lot of marathon training plans on line, and most suggest you devote 3-6 months to a good, solid training program.  Find one you like, and count backwards from your race date.  <br>  <br>  While you're training, I always find it helps to have friends to run with, especially on the long runs.  And - important - if something hurts, stop and let it heal.<br>  <br>  With this long-term plan in mind, you'll show up at the start line in just a year ready to crush your marathon and earn your medal

qsib4uoGaa	In 1990 the New Jersey Nets selected, Derrick Coleman who was a PF/C. So they were looking for a big man, if Shaq was there they would of drafted him.

ePvvGUu3aa	It can be seen in both ways. A great wrestler would add some more meaning and credibility to the title. While the title has all the meaning and credibility with all the history, once it's on someone it can make someone. I mean if you look at the title, you see and think about all the greats who held it in the past or currently and when it's on someone, it kind of adds more to that wrestler. As I said, it goes both ways though.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	A wrestler really makes a title worth something. Yes, it is good for the wrestler's character for the title to be had but it's really what he does with the title that develops himself and the title's attributes.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	The wrestler makes the title , the title is just a bit of metal - you have to make it creditable .|`|AA11435718	well that is all in promotion they in just look at Tommy Dreamer The Sandman|`|UbUSth5haa	This how I think of it, the wrestler makes the title and the title makes the wrestler, because think about it, if you are a big star in the game, that doesn't mean anything unless you hold a championship because then you're prestige goes up so the title makes you but then you make the title because if you are a good wrestler and people like you and you are deserving of the title the title's prestige goes up, from my personal opinion i dont think batista would have been taken seriously unless he held championship gold and that is just what Evolution did, if you couldn't hold a championship then you were done.|`|G2OdDlmjaa	neither the people that get 6 figure checks to make the fake story lines make the wrestler.

EXAMPLE 2 people used to like kurt angle but tna writers made him a jack azz<br>  <br>  P.S. wrestling is g.a.y.|`|69BWmMRraa	the wrestler makes the title  so that's how they get there name|`|WQGvE60waa	The title is a piece of Metal.<br>  <br>  A True champion has spirit and heart.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Personally I think when a wrestler wins a title it means something to the wrestler. It tells them the promotions is confident in you to be the top of their promotion, and you've worked hard.<br>  <br>  To the peoples eyes when a Wrestler is holding a title they'll know who you are and remember you for years to come as long as you hold that belt.

wvJmLgKxaa	The alps would be your best bet... france, italy, switzerland, germany, austria. I went snowboarding in Switzerland last year and i wasn't all that impressed. Although i did have fun i do recommend staying away from Gstaad mountain in switzerland or maybe other mountains. The mountain was totally skiier oriented, and had long cat walks which are not fun for snowboarders. The equipment was very expensive (everything is switzerland is) and where we went people spoke german (my family and i speak a good amount of french) so we had some translation problems. Since your living in canada, maybe you speak french? if so then i would recommend france as a good place to snowboard. I know i didnt help much but in my opinion stay away from switzerland.|`|0eAUeyU2aa	Stari Vrh, Slovenia.

K5AeQuSNaa	It is just fine.  It will work on anything up to medium sized game for a beginning hunter, and is fully capable of taking large game in the hands of an experienced hunter.  It may not be ideal for elk, moose, or brown bear, but is can kill them if you know what you are doing, and use the right bullets.  For smaller game and varmints, use the 65-85 grain bullets.  For anything larger than a coyote, use the 95-100 grain bullets.  .243 isn't the wonder cartridge that some hunters swear it is, but it is a good, reliable meat getter.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Very nice choice for folks just starting out and seasoned hunters / target shooters.......<br>  <br>  While you at it take a look at this .243 cartridge guide -- Its geared a bit more towards target competition but still relevant for hunting......|`|WBGnXsr7aa	That is a great starter rifle, you can use it for coyote, fox and deer. Nice choice and a decent caliber|`|AA11640949	These people are all so quick to say it's a good rifle.  They are correct as long as it's not a model 770.  The 770 is an embarrassment to Remington's good name.  Some people have good luck with them, but overall they are known for being cheap quality and quite inaccurate.<br>  <br>  If it's a 700 and it's not abused (barrel worn out, not properly cared for, etc) then you should be really happy with it.  .243 is an excellent cartridge.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I use a .243 as a varmint/predator gun. It shoots flatter than the .223, and is close to a 22-250. I like Hornady and Black Hills ammo. I use Black Hills 55 grain Nosler Ballistic Tip for Coyote.<br>  <br>  I do not hunt deer with it any longer. I found that it does not work nearly as well as a 30 caliber. I hunted deer with this caliber for 3 season, and killed maybe 5 Deer, but they always ran off with little blood trail. They all died quick, but often left little to track.<br>  <br>  I do however shoot coyote with it a a farm where coyote come in 200 to 300 meters. I swear the 22-250 has nothing on a .243. The bullets in 55 grain seem to penetrate 6 to 10 inches maximum, and expand to the point of fragmentation. They drop Coyote like they were hit by lightning. I get close to 3900 fps out of a Remington 700 bolt I bought second hand, and customized with a Shilling barrel. <br>  <br>  It is however a Great starter gun, and an Awesome varmint shooter. <br>  <br>  Look into 100  grain Hornady Light Magnum loads for your rifle when you hunt Deer. They push pretty fast, and will drive deep. I dont recall what deer ammo I used out of my .243; it was 15 years ago. I think I was using a Winchester 100 grain soft point.<br>  <br>  Lots of Luck, and congrats on your first rifle.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Great choice, can be used to Hunt Varmints.* Great Match or Target Shooting caliber from 0 to 1,000 yards.* Will anchor a Buck with authority.* Very flat shooting trajectory, and high impact energy. It has the greatest variety of bullet weights for you to choose from for Varmint or Big Game Hunting.* 58, 70,75,80,87, 90,95,105,106, 107,108, 115 grain bullets.* Recommended by Winchester for hunting Groundhogs, Fox, Coyote, Whitetail Deer, Black Bear, Mule Deer, and Antelope.*... Not recommended for Hunting Moose, Elk, Brown Bear, Caribou, Eland, Elephant, Cape Buffalo, Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Hippo,and Rhino.*|`|VP48PjM9aa	My first centerfire rifle was a Remington Model 7400 .243, my dad bought it for my 12th birthday.  I killed my first deer with it.  This rifle is unbelievably accurate for an autoloader, it likes the Federal Premium 85gr. Barnes TSX.  It has served me very well in the field for 28 years.  It now belongs to my 9 year old son, he shoots it with with extreme confidence, he killed his first deer this past season.  The point is the .243 Win. in an awesome caliber, you do not need anything more for ANY deer, black bear, or antelope.  I believe in it so much that I bought myself another .243 Win, a Remington Model 700 VLS.  It is not just a beginners rifle, it will last a lifetime.  Spend some time behind it and it will not let you down.  When the moment of truth arrives, with a well placed shot, your deer will drop as though lightning hit him.  When the naysayers arrive and they will, just ignore them, because they no not what they speak.|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	It is a perfect starter rifle. It don't kick which will make shooting fun. By not being afraid to shoot it do to the kick you should get good at shooting it which keeps interest. A .243 is one of the more accurate calibers and good for hunting varmints and animals up to the size of a deer. There are also many bullet weights to chose from that gives you these hunting option.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I got my .243, a Remington 788 Carbine, when I was 14.  I'm 40 now, and have used it to kill over 15 deer.  All were one shot kills.  I use 100 grain bullets for deer hunting, and I like the Hornady Light Magnum variety, or hand loads.<br>  This gun is good for deer, hogs, wild turkeys, and target practice.  I only shoot what I'm going to eat (other than targets), so that's the end of the list for me, though some would say it's also perfect for coyotes and other "varmints".<br>  One more to add to the list: Squirrels.  If you're good enough, you can "bark" them with it.  Shoot the tree limb they are on, about an inch below where they are sitting, and the shock from the impact will kill them instantly.|`|Fq6oy03laa	You'll really enjoy the 243, it is a perfect first rifle and it will take down any thing from deer size animals to gophers. I use mine for varmit hunting and for white tail hunting.|`|5qzndqYQaa	It is good for coyote and deer.
YPQTXOQ5aa	It is about money, Goodyear pays a lot of money.<br>  <br>  It is also about safety.

We don't want to have the tire wars again.|`|bJn83u7Oaa	because goodyear picks the compound for each track that they think will perform the best and not blow out.  if teams had the option, they would go with softer tires for grip, but softer tires wear out and blow out easier, so goodyear picks the combination for grip and durability.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	NASCAR has a contract with Goodyear.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I was that way to some extent in the past..<br>  No company but Goodyear can meet NASCAR's<br>  requirements to compete..<br>  The last company that tried was Hoosier, and they<br>  failed miserably, in spite of their experience making racing tires...]<br>  Tires that can maintain 200 mph over a long period of time represent <br>  quite a manufacturing challenge..

iWTdzJoaaa	Highlights aired from last week of the Sting and Kurt Angle<br>  bickering.<br>  <br>  This week's show is called "Main Event Mess".<br>  <br>  Inside Jeff Jarrett's office, Jim Cornette threw a fit because he didn't want Sting and Angle to fight in an empty arena because it would be an insurance issue.<br>  <br>  Jarrett said he didn't want there to be an Angle vs. Jarrett 3 because it could bring the company down. Mick Foley sat in the background on a couch and Jeremy Borash stood there with a mic until Cornette chased him away.<br>  <br>  Mike Tenay and Don West introduced the show. Tenay immediately questioned whether "TNA Founder" Jeff Jarrett would sign off on the empty arena match. They said this could be the most unique episode in the history.<br>  <br>  Kurt Angle came to the ring wearing his wrestling gear. Angle said the only way the Main Event Mafia could be brought down is if it was brought down from the inside. Angle asked Jarrett to clear the entire arena so there wouldn't be any distractions. "All I want is me and Sting in the Impact Zone.<br>  <br>  Backstage, Lauren interviewed the Motor City Machine Guns. Chris Sabin did all the talking until Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed attacked them. They two teams fought until the commercial break.<br>  <br>  -commercial-<br>  <br>  1. Motor City Machine Guns defeated Lethal Consequences in a street fight in 5:50. After the break, the two teams were fighting in the entrance area. Tenay said the bell sounded to start the match. The two teams fought their way inside the ring. The Guns were wearing matching t-shirts and sweatpants. West put the two teams over as being four of the brightest young stars of the company. At 4:30, Lethal hit Sabin with the Lethal Combination on a chair for a near fall. Later, Shelley accidentally hit Sabin with the X Division Title belt. Sabin eventually recovered, picked up the belt, and hit Creed with it. Shelley made the cover and got the pin.<br>  <br>  Backstage, Borash interviewed Jarrett, Cornette, and Foley. Cornette said a decision has been made. He said he doesn't agree with it, but Jarrett is the boss and made the call. Corny said everyone other than the announcers, the camera crew, and the two wrestlers would be cleared from the building. Jarrett stood up and said it's going to be exciting.<br>  <br>  -commercial-<br>  <br>  Inside the Mafia dressing room, Angle told Scott Steiner and Booker T that it had to be him or Sting. Steiner said it doesn't have to be that way. Booker got upset and talked about how he's travelled up and down the road with Sting. Angle said it could be a handicap match. Booker took offense. Kevin Nash stood up and yelled at everyone and had Booker leave the room.<br>  <br>  The camera followed Booker and Sharmell into the hallway. A.J. Styles showed up and attacked Booker in his continuing pursuit to let everyone know he's a legend. Styles left Booker lying.<br>  <br>  Beer Money and Jacqueline came to the ring to issue a special challenge. Storm swigged from his beer bottle. Roode opened the promo by saying that they've found the show to be extremely boring so far. Roode bragged that they've taken down everyone faced. He said they have an idea that will raise the stakes in TNA. He said the idea is the "Off the Wagon Challenge." Storm took the mic and said it's the "my momma's tired of watching you on TV challenge." He said they will defend the tag titles, but if they win the match the person who gets pinned has to leave the company forever. Storm said the challenge is open to anyone, including Mike Tenay and Don West.<br>  <br>  Backstage, Roxxi and Taylor Wilde joked around about taking the Beer Money challenge. The Governor was still there doing her usual schtick. They switched the focus to the Beautiful People. They all laughed about the Beautiful People falling in horse ****.<br>  <br>  -commercial-<br>  <br>  The latest therapy session with Dr. Stevie and Abyss aired. Abyss lied back on the couch and said pain brings him pleasure whether it's his opponent's or his own.<br>  <br>  2. Shane Sewell and LAX defeated Brutus Magnus, Sheik Abdul Bashir, and Matt Morgan in 4:00. Tenay pointed out that Magnus was a UK Gladiator, and Morgan was an American Gladiator. The heels roughed up Sewell early in the match. All six guys were fighting each other in no time. Late in the match, Hernandez hit the Border Toss on Bashir. Hernandez tagged Sewell into the match. Sewell hit the top rope elbow drop on Bashir and scored the pin.<br>  <br>  -commercial-<br>  <br>  The latest edition of Hardcore History with Mick Foley aired. He recalled the cardboard box gimmick he did with Sting, and the elbow he dropped on him.<br>  <br>  At ringside, Jim Cornette told the announcers that a tag team that hasn't teamed together in a couple years was reuniting to accept the Beer Money challenge.<br>  <br>  Backstage, Lauren asked Scott Steiner, who was working out, if he was able to get through to Kurt Angle and "talk him down." Steiner said that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Steiner said that if Lauren wants to work out with him she has to take her clothes off. St|`|KqqKMs3Gaa	Jim Cornette is trying to talk Jeff Jarrett into not letting Kurt Angle have his requested empty arena match against Sting, since he (Cornette) thinks TNA will be liable. Jeff doesn't see much of a choice, since he certainly doesn't want to go against Kurt a third time. Cornette suddenly realizes that it might be imprudent to discuss legal liability on camera, so he kicks Borash (and the camera?) out of the office. <br>  <br>  [Opening Credits] <br>  <br>  Kurt Angle comes down to the ring to start off the show. He's glad to see that everyone, from management to the fans, got what they wanted—the demise of the Main Event Mafia. When he formed it, he always said that the only thing that could bring them down was selfishness from the inside. So tonight Angle is taking a stand for the Mafia, and it'll be either him or Sting. He wants the crowd cleared so there won't be any distractions, and suggests that Jeff will not get another opportunity like this. <br>  <br>  Lauren is in the back with The Motor City Machine Guns. She observes that the MEM isn't the only stable that's breaking down, as The Guns have a street fight booked against Lethal and Creed. Sabin tries to cut a promo, but somehow manages to say that they both always look out for themselves and put everyone else first. I think I see why they generally let Shelley do the talking. Lethal Consequences jump the Guns. <br>  <br>  [Commercial Break] <br>  <br>  (1) THE MOTOR CITY MACHINE GUNS vs. LETHAL CONSEQUENCES <br>  <br>  Lethal Consequences have beaten The Guns all the way to the ring before the Guns turn things around. They toss Lethal out of the way to quickly double team Creed against the barricade. They get into the ring with Lethal, nailing a Leaping Elbow and a Poetry in Motion Forearm. Shelley Baseball Slides Creed on his way back to the ring, then holds a chair in front of Lethal's face which Sabin dropkicks into him. Shelley knocks back Creed again, but when Sabin goes to follow up with a Suicide Dive he goes headfirst into another chair. Lethal Consequences double team Shelley in the ring. Lethal tosses him a chair, which Creed then Sprinboard Leg Drops him into. Wow. Creed flips over the top rope to take out Sabin. Wow again. Lethal tries to shove Shelley into a chair into the corner, but Shelley stops himself and yanks Lethal's head into it for two. Lethal rolls out of the ring, and when Shelley tries to follow him he gets a chair to the belly. Meanwhile, Creed tries to go for a Leg Drop off the top rope on Sabin, but he whiffs. Sabin sets up a chair in the ring, drops Creed's head into the edge, then kicks the chair back into his face. He goes to finish the match with the Cradle Shock, but Lethal breaks it up with a Lethal Combo on Sabin into the chair. Shelley breaks up the count at two. Lethal has at some point set up a ladder as a bridge from the ring to the barricade. Lethal goes for his Tajiri-style Handspring Elbow on Shelley, but Sabin has recovered enough to whack him with a chair. Shelley hits a Celtic Cross, but Creed breaks it up at two. Sabin grabs Creed and Shelley goes to nail him with the X Division Championship, but Creed dodges and Shelley whacks Sabin. Lethal comes back in for the attempted double team, but Shelley Back Body Drops him out of the ring and onto the ladder. Shelley grabs Creed, and this time Sabin can connect with the belt for the 1-2-3. <br>  <br>  WINNER: The Motor City Machine Guns in 7 minutes (from the official start of the match). That was fun **. If it had been a bit longer it would have been PPV quality. <br>  <br>  The MEM tell us to cross the line. <br>  <br>  JB is in the Jarrett's locker room, where Cornette announces that, over his objections, Jarrett has ordered the arena cleared for an empty arena match. Foley is mysteriously taking notes on something in the background. <br>  <br>  [Commercial Break] <br>  <br>  JB is in the MEM's locker room, where Booker and Steiner aren't thrilled with Kurt. Steiner doesn't think it has to be this way. Kurt says Sting's been disrespecting them for weeks. Booker doesn't think Sting's ever disrespected him as much as some people have, to which Kurt suggests that maybe they should make tonight's match a handicap match. Nash breaks things up before they can get overly hostile, and Booker goes for a walk to cool off. JB goes with him, asking if the MEM is over. Maybe Sting is going to swerve us all after all. AJ Styles jumps Booker in the hallway, plastering him with the Legends' Championship. <br>  <br>  Beer Money Inc., with Jacqueline, come down to the ring to issue a "special challenge". Roode says that while tonight's show has been exciting, he and Storm have been bored. They are the tag team champions and just like our slumping economy they've knocked down every tag team in their way. I didn't realize the economy was even in the tag division, nor can I find any way to punctuate that sentence to make it coherent. So Beer Money are bored, and have decided to issue an off-the-wagon challenge. That means that anyone who wants can challenge them for th|`|np8IuMqqaa	<a href="http://getinthis.cstrainingmotors6.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinthis.cstrainingmotors6.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
20zLmf3Laa	As a Packer fan myself, I'd like to think so, but to start out in a 3-4 and expect immediate results, that would be a naive way of thinking. I mean they won't become the Pittsburgh Steelers defense overnight just because they have Capers, Greene, and the ex-Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator coaching defense. It takes time to effectively make that transition. I also don't think they have enough of the right types of players to have immediate success. In my opinion, I don't think there is a more complete defensive end in the league than Aaron Kampman. He can rush the passer and he's stout against the run, but I can't see him playing OLB and being able to cover TE's or RB's coming out of the backfield, in pass coverage. <br>  They need more depth on the D line. In a 3-4, your DE's are the size of DT's in a 4-3 defense and your nose tackle has to be a wall and not get pushed around. I believe Pickett can be an effective NT, but they need somebody else to back him up. They have Jenkins as an end and Harrell as the other which are both coming off of season ending injuries, and nobody else after that.|`|XLXncQu9aa	It is a possibility, however changing from a 4-3 to a 3-4 won't help anything if the schemes are not right and if the players involved are not up to par.  The key here is getting the right defensive players and staying healthy.  I think it was a good move to hire Dom Capers because he is a great defensive guy but the Packers have issues on defense.  They need to draft a few defensive players on the LB's side and it wouldn't hurt to get some in the secondary.  i would say their best defensive players are Charles Woodson, Aaron Kampman and Mike McKenzie.  I believe switching to a 3-4 is helpful, because in this case you have 3 lineman and 4 line backers in addition to having 4 defensive backs.  This is helpful because it can increase the amount of pass coverage as opposed to a 4-3 defense.  So I think it can help but it means nothing if they don't have the right defensive schemes.  I think they will do better next season provided they stay healthy.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	Danny D if you want Peppers, you wont be able to get orakpo in the draft. Peppers was tagged and the only way he leaves Carolina is if a team gives up 2 1st round picks for him. Then they have to sign him to a big fat juicy contract. If you guys get Peppers, then you can kiss this and next years 1st round picks goodbye which means orakpo is no longer an option. Leave Peppers alone and go with orakpo. Peppers is to much of a me player and he might hurt the organization more then help it. I just dont think it would be smart to take a tremendous hit on the salary cap and trade away 2 1st round picks for him. They Pac is better off with what they have now and then draft orakpo. Either way they will have a dominate defense that all teams have to respect and this is coming from a Giants fan.|`|i0QzvbSnaa	It all comes down to the DEs. Depending on how they run it, the DEs are basically now the outside linebackers now that have to be able to rush, cover, and stop the run. If you have really solid players playing this position on each side and someone who really likes playing nose tackle and can clog up the middle, the 3-4 is very tough. <br>  In a way you have 5 linemen, but the outside 2 just have to be more versatile.|`|PG1LuEk5aa	they also moved kampman to LB...so we got barnett, hawk, kampman and chillar at LB....jenkins, harrel and hopefully come draft day orakpo from texas....and also we still have a shot of getting peppers and haynesworth...peppers wants to play OLB in a 3-4 to utilize his athletecism....this would be the most terrifying d in the nfc if not the league...with the secondary we got a core of players like this in a 3-4 would be devastating.  Could u imagine what our d would be like if we didn't get rid of KGB and moved him to LB instead of chillar....wow....but i see us being 12 and 4.... 11 and 5 somewhere in that area with this defense....the defense coach is also peppers old coach so i hope he comes more than haynesworth....either one would be good.....go pack|`|piM3bj9Gaa	The odds are that they will struggle out of the gate with their new defense.  I would say a slow start and possibly gelling as the season goes along.  Look for an marked improvement in year 2 (assuming they get the right guys for the system).|`|PwvVoWFYaa	I REALLY HOPE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING <br>  <br>  GO PACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It will allow Kampman to be more active along with their speedy linebackers. I think they will get more sacks and also be more consistent.|`|VQyTspNraa	The Packers are gonna be killa.

ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	I think you could finish the marathon, but I think you'd rather enjoy the race and want to do it again, so I suggest you hold off and give yourself a good four-month training routine to get yourself ready.  <br>  <br>  For now, you should be working on a base of 3-4 runs a week totaling at least 20 miles.  From that base, you'll be ready to hop on one of the gazillion marathon  training plans you'll find below, and make a race. <br>  <br>  Like I say, you could do it now, and stagger across the finish line.

Good luck, whichever way you go.|`|r2WbxKkCaa	It all depends on how much running you have done in the past.  I did my first marathon off 10 weeks training and ran a 3.09.  Make sure you are implementing the progressive overload (don't go too hard too soon).  Longer runs on the weekend should start at about an hour and half and bump this each week until you hit about 3 hours with 4 weeks to spare.  The other long run should be on wednesdays starting at about an hour and working up to 90mins.  Don't undervalue speed work such as 600s and 1km reps.  Also add in some short hill work for strength.  Good luck mate.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	It doesn't sound like you've ever run long distances, so you'd be attempting something very difficult.  I would suggest you give yourself more time to train.

b938eb81dc5897a41b3efbcbed9dc6e6aa	Si es así, creo porque se tiene el concepto que "mejor gol" corresponde al último jugador que patea. El gol, mal llamado "de Cambiasso" fue una joya del trabajo de equipo. Vean cómo se mueven los volantes, cómo pasan al ataque los volantes, cómo se proyecta el defensor de punta, cómo pasa el juego al centro, cómo se abre la cancha y finalmente cómo se penetra al área rival, con un jugador que jamás se pensó que podría llegar a esa posición.

Keep your body straight-- your head should be directly above the center point between your feet. <br>  3) Bend down keeping your head above your board. (Don't lean forward, just squat.) <br>  4) Pop your ollie and jump with it but don't throw your shoulders back as you go up. Right after your tail taps the ground, kick your front foot forward with the heel in a kind of diagonal direction. Kick it out in front of you but also kick it a little toward the direction in which you are rolling. This helps to give you a flip that you can see and catch easier. <br>  5) Don't lean back!

Usually in a tournament where you have lose twice to be out, the teams that win would be put in a winner's bracket, and the teams that lose will be put in the loser's bracket, or consolation bracket.   So consolation would be the best of the losers bracket.

ec231581cb70152786bb3b84dd274f5daa	Kobe at 19 was one of the best bench players in the NBA, while Jordan at 19 was still playing for the Tar Heels and leading them to NCAA championships. Big difference in competition. <br>  <br>  Also, in regard to some of the other people who posted answers, you are not looking at the question. First off, they are asking about Kobe and Jordan each at 19, not at 7 years or at the end of their careers. Second, the question itself is kind of misleading. Is it asking whether the player meant more to their respective team, or who would win in a one-on-one situation?<br>  <br>  I still say Jordan at 19 was better than Kobe at 19. Kobe was still an NBA player getting incredible performance off of limited bench minutes, but Jordan was taking his Tar Heels team upon his shoulders, especially in playoff time, and won the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA basketball championship, while putting up record numbers. Hopefully, that's enough to cover leadership, team contribution, and atmosphere.|`|C4woRaDzaa	yes|`|babea3d5b92ed9fdea897b7e13dd07c5aa	no|`|dblQAX3paa	Impossible to say, Jordan at 19 was an all american in the 82-83 season, Sporting News Player of the year, and Kobe was averaging 15 a game off the bench for a good nba team.  Who knows Jordan at 21 was better than Kobe at 21, so with that knowledge i'd go with MJ, but who knows|`|CrcNinrEaa	no never <br>  how did u think that<br>  kobe can never beat jordan|`|UHJipzA6aa	Yea, i think so. Jordan was still in college and kobe was already in the nba, so it is hard to compare the two since they were playing against different competition.|`|b384ec1e5a23f4c6f7202b9b2b80e46baa	Kobe will never be able to even hold Jordans jock|`|mKWNCTmEaa	I believe your video has nothing to do with your question.  First of all  i think that Kobe is a great player with awesome talent but he will be no MJ. When Kobe was 19 he was riding the pines at like the eight or nine spot.  When MJ was nineteen he was lighting things up down there in North Carolina winning national championships and the college player of the year awards. Kobe biggest mistakes where not going to college to polish some of his skills off, and signing with the Lakers.  I sure you heard this before but Kobe will not win without Shaq plain and simple.  Kobe does'nt have the team skills like MJ had. MJ made every player around him better. Steve Kerr, John Paxson, Horace Grant Luc Longley, Bill Wennington, Jud Buchlear, Toni Kukoc I can go all night with these names, but when it was all over these player did'nt make it any where else. Kobe lost Shaq the player that made him better because of his ego. So like the video Kobe at 19 {riding the bench} or MJ at 35{national championship college player of the year, 5 time regular season MVP, 6 championships, 6 finals MVP, 10 time scoring leader with 7 in a row, 9 defensive first team, 10 all NBA team, 1 defensive player of the year,14 all star game with 3 MVP, 2 time slam dunk champion, 1 rookie of the year and 2 olympic gold medals} so who would you rather have on your team at 19|`|0c6c73382098f545ce46bef3dd619b2caa	STOP COMPARING KOBE TO JORDAN!!

23b9fcf57c61f64d3abe97aeafbc9bc2aa	First off football players DO train with pads. What do u mean by staying on your feet? Do you mean they slip or they get knocked over? If they're slipping it's probably the grass and them losing their footing. Getting knocked over... Hell football is a violent sport. the point of tackling is to knock the guy onto his backside. Blocking tries to do that as well. And putting someone on his rear end takes a lot of energy so if you miss or the guy just slips you, chances are you're going to lose balance. Football's a violent sport, so when you're sprinting and getting shoved constantly on a grassy surface chances are you're going to fall.|`|36354e153234d8ee9a930c2eaaa79467aa	they are tripping over their giant egos|`|be481b19ccd802eafb96849f78d0673aaa	You are either watching the Cowboy's or  soccer players.

You try getting hit by a 350lb man and see if you still stand afterwards|`|3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	Agreed, I've played both sports, and let me tell you, Rugby is alot less painful then you'd think, you don't need equipment because Rugby players rarely get a full head of steam on the tackler, Football players always are coming full speed at one another getting hit by people much larger than that in a rugby game, Rugby players also often have padded helmets or ear gaurds|`|6f1c75f745f6a1ac42c50329433e9eb5aa	American Football is a sport of steroid fueled whimps. Why they need to play with pads and a helmet is beyond me. They should come to Australia and play a real game like Rugby League. The men in that sport don't wear protection of any kind. But if American footballers were to play it they would all cry like little girls.

TRsTJ8Sgaa	He is actually averaging slightly over 15 minutes per game when he gets in.  Check his game stats.  The problem is there are so many games he doesn't get in at all.  I am pretty sure the biggest reason is he is a defensive liablity.  He definitely wasn't player of the year for his defense.  Sheldon Williams was defensive player of the year and he struggles for minutes because his offense needs work.  Now if they were to come together and genetically create a kid, that kid would get some decent minutes.  Although he may be sitting on the bench just because he looks funny.|`|a0223cb90091117bae34fe4ba8dec364aa	He is not playing cause he sucks.|`|e9f703d5de5c60d5db6d3c4a08587a68aa	He is too slow to guard anybody. His problem is his build is really slight, so it's easy to bang him around. If he tries to bulk up, though, he'll get even slower. I don't think he'll ever be a great pro. His best hope is to try to have a Steve Kerr type of career, where he plays with a Lebron or Wade type player who can draw the defense away from him. Barring that, he's going to be a washout.|`|6Uc1Elv8aa	He doesn't play defence.|`|Bl3P6z3Laa	maybe there are faults in his game where he isnt producing well and the coach is opting for more experienced players. he did have a good stretch of playing time and output.<br>  <br>  perhaps if the team isnt making the playoffs he may get more time....id say look for him to get more time next season after his body is adjusted to nba style basketball and his shooting is more consistant, i think he will claim some more playing time.....will probably help if there are less guards on the roster also|`|PY4gI42Maa	Against Dallas Saturday night he shot an AIRBALL! and he missed the basket by like 6 inches!<br>  <br>  If a guy doesn't get minutes usually they are playing poorly in practice.

But NBA wise he is a small guy playing SG because he can't play the point.  He can't handle the ball, he plays no 'D', and he is trying to play a position where most guys are 6'7 or taller with crazy ups.  Add that to being a weak little girl from Dook.  Duke players suck in the pros, everybody knows that!|`|XRzQzWGvaa	He is a rookie and most coaches don't play their rookies that much.  If they fall out of the playoff race then Redick will get more time to play.|`|jzKZThFjaa	for a player like him, maybe he should ask Steve Kerr, Tim Legler or Danny Ainge on how to survive in the NBA.

These are all considered Rookies this year...<br>  <br>  Delmon Young is the best prospect on the board and should have a nice rookie season.<br>  <br>  Alex Gordon looks very good and at home at 3b.  you can normally pick him up at the end of the draft. <br>  <br>  Lastly Stephen Drew.  The guy played a bit last season and is a SS.  He should have a nice year...<br>  <br>  (PS) Keep your eyes out for Chris Young of arizona, and Phillip Hughes if he breaks the Rotation.

He dropped off a bit at the end and as he gets more accostomed to the lengh of the MLB seasons, he will maintain his numbers better.

I saw Morneau play in the minors. He's a natural. He will be around a long time and will be productive. He will have stats comparable to your prediction, and his average will be around .310-.315 range. I used to be an old Twins fan, too, when they had Bobby Allison, Harmon Killebrew, Tony Oliva, Bert Blylevyn (spelling), & one of the greatest, all around hitters of all times, Rod Carew. The Twins will be in the top 3 or 4 AL teams this season. Bosox will rank first, Chisox, second--Twins, Indians, or Yanks (boring) may also contend.

23b9fcf57c61f64d3abe97aeafbc9bc2aa	Run. But don't just run a straight couple miles and call it a day. Go out with a friend to the track and run a mile or two, then do sprints. the track has a long straightaway on both sides that go for about 100 meters, race your friend down these straightaways probably at least eight times and change it up a bit sometimes, start off even or have someone leading and someone chase the other down, work on pumping your arms properly and driving the knees. One drill i made up is a bit of a box drill that works on cuts. Place four cones in a box as wide as you please (10-15 yards apart) then start at one cone, and sprint to the one right in front of you, as you reach the cone, make a cut to the cone on your left and do the same again. You can also work on live routes with a friend to work on your hands and timing. Once you get the cuts down you should do the routes a lot so that all the cuts are burned into your muscle memory. Play catch with a friend, but not your ordinary catch. Your friend should make it as hard as possible but not impossible for you to catch the football. Every time you miss or drop the pass you get down and do ten push-ups. This worked for Dwayne Jarrett to be the spectacular catch beast he is today.<br>  This is one optional thing you can do but i think it would really help you out. Learn to block. There are plenty of wide receivers that have great hands and great speed, but there aren't many that can block. Nothing will catch the coach's eye more than great blocking by a wide receiver, except for a catch behind the defender's helmet. Have a friend and you lined up like a WR and DB, then run like you're running a route. Your friend sees run and then tries to get past you. Block him LEGALLY (hands inside, thumbs up, grab no jersey, wide base, short choppy steps) and drive him back as much as you can.<br>  With these drills you should focus really on speed (sprints), acceleration (box drill), your cuts (box drill and live routes), and catching(playing extreme catch :])That's my take, try these out and see what they do for you. Most of all, have fun when you play, it sounds corny but believe me, enjoy every moment of the season it'll be gone before you know it.|`|1d82076c63425fc7ea90d65c2c51804baa	Stand on a latter and have someone fire bricks at you.<br>  you will make sure you use your hands every time and you will learn to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  It worked for Jerry Rice.|`|be481b19ccd802eafb96849f78d0673aaa	Run, find some area with thick woods and start running threw them.

These guys ALL had their doubts about themselves because they did NOT make the A-Team. Well, I told them, you guys will find a way to be BETTER than that team in something. When I saw the determination they had, and they were serious about improving themselves, I started coaching them in the POWER of VISUALIZATION. They began to do 100 Free Throws with their eyes closed at the beginning and the end of practice. They were to see themselves make their shots, see themselves in the games, making those free throws. They also had "Homework", they were supposed to mentally shoot 100 free throws each evening as they lay in their bed before going to sleep! And, they would do the same when they woke up...mentally shoot 100 free throws BEFORE they got out of bed.<br>  <br>  My B-team SHOT 74% for the ENTIRE basketball season.

He's a basketball coach, and really great inspirational writer.  Try to let yourself limber up, and relax.  Practice as much and as often as you can.  Shoot lay ups, practice passes with a friend and practice dribbling moves.  The more practice you get, the better you'll get.   Everyone makes mistakes, in fact, there's a saying that says the path to success is filled with mistakes and failures, just keep learning from them.  Don't be afraid of the ball, or afraid of your apponent.  You don't want to get penalties for charging into them, but keep your cool that they're NOT going to get the ball from you, no matter how intimidating they are.  Good luck, little buddy.

799d0ff41900aaa5596e42c532f26997aa	A couple things that you can do:<br>  <br>  1. Talk to the coach about it in private.<br>  <br>  2. Start chucking shots (I wouldn't recommend that).<br>  <br>  3. Develop an appreciation for the other parts of the game. The best players aren't great because of their scoring, but because of the other things that they do. Work on your passing, rebounding and defense. Watch a lot of basketball and pay attention to what the important spots on the court are and how you should be moving to give your team the best opportunity to win. You can actually have a much bigger impact on the game if you are good at keeping the floor balanced (players pretty evenly spread out on offense), passing quickly and well, playing great D, hustling and setting good screens and picks.<br>  <br>  There is more to the game than scoring. A whole lot more.

Most of the story lines revolve around them so you see a lot more of teh singles wresters now.<br>  <br>  Not much focus on the tag teams like they were in the eighties and early nineties.  I miss the tag teams like Legion of Doom ( Hawk and Animal version)  Heidenrich sucks ***...<br>  Demolition, Hart Foundation, British Bulldogs, The Skyscrapers ( Sid Vicous and Danny Spivey ) The new Blackjacks ( Barry Windham and Bradshaw {JBL} )  The Steiner Brothers , the BrainBusters (Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson) , Money Inc., ( Ted DiBiase and I.R.S. ) and a whole lot more.. those were awesome tag teams...   todays tag teams seem like they are just thrown together...  like Edge and Randy Orton....Spirit Squad.. Rosey and The Hurricane ( yea I know.. that is an old one )  but the point is...  there is no chemistry there.  <br>  <br>  If you notice they are bringing a lot of the old teams back together again.  Team Extreme ( Matt and Jeff Hardy)  DX ( HHH and HBK)  and These guys have been together for a while now  but they may be coming back to WWE....  THE NEW AGE OUTLAWS!<br>  So WWE needs to focus a little more on the Tag Team Division again.  and it looks like they are doing so.<br>  <br>  As far as Divas go..  just eye candy...  the only ones with wrestling talent are Victoria and Mickey James.  The others cant fight their way out of a wet paper bag.

The move sees the attacking wrestler put an opponent up in a fireman's carry (across the wrestler's shoulders) position, then throw the opponent's legs out in front of him/her to spin them out while the attacking wrestler falls backwards to drive the opponent's head in to the mat. The move's name was taken from the Fujita scale, which ranks the intensity of a tornado, with F-5 being the strongest.

c026f214ce25aaca881d2aff949cfcdcaa	In one word...No.<br>  <br>  Bynum is a guy who will be a very good player in this league for a very long time. Players with his size, and skills, are just to hard to come by. If Kidd were even a couple years younger, it would be more tempting, but he isn't, and bringing him to L.A. wouldn't guarantee a championship anyway. The Lakers aren't a team that's just one player away from winning a title. They have several holes to fill. The Nets are probably salivating to get there mitts on Bynum.|`|5981536910b10187bd7f11cb716c6f18aa	As a laker fan there is no way in hell I want to trade Bynum especially for a high priced and aging kidd<br>  <br>  I don't even want to give up Kwame|`|AA10008398	I'd like Kidd on the Lakers, but not for Bynum.  So I'd say no.|`|f369ce3ec09367be3652c2257bb5ed9daa	I know the Lakers are unwilling to trade Bynum, but if I were in charge, and I knew the deal would not get done w/o including Bynum, I would pull the trigger.  If Bynum only turns out to be average or less, they will regret not going for it when they had the chance.  If Bynum turns out to be great, fine, Kidd is a proven commodity with at least 5 more productive years left in his Hall of Fame career!  The window can close fast, take advantage if you are only a player away from a potential championship run!|`|yG8vzgXVaa	Bynums not going anywhere.

At 34 kidd may have a couple solid years left at most.  At 29, Kobe still has 5-6 years ahead of him at or slightly below his current level and can wait a couple years to develop.  Besides, in recent history, teams with a strong forward/center have won championships(exluding jordan) i.e hakeem, duncan/robinson, shaq, ben/rasheed wallace.|`|047e6da7f02aa1645e83702ccf97a1d2aa	I agree with this trade fully. What the Lakers need is someone to do the dishing so that Kobe can score as much as he did again without having to be a ball hog. Kidd can find anyone on the floor and gets regular triple-doubles. Who else can do that? Steve Nash hasn't gotten any triple-doubles this season. <br>     I think trading Kidd to the Lakers will improve them. It will benefit the lakers more than it will benefit the Nets. The Nets has a solid low-post game already. The Lakers need a great playmaker and someone who will swing the rythm of the game to their favor. Mihm and Brown can replace Bynum down under.|`|9agoQGfhaa	as a lakers fan i don't want to see bynum go....actually i don't want to see any of them go..|`|XRzQzWGvaa	No the Nets would not agree to the trade without Bynum and the Lakers don't seem willing to part with him.|`|bpHzFuJMaa	it doesnt make sense for the lakers. what they could do is get magloire from the blazers in exchange of mihm and some washed up player like mcckie (i think this is already a done deal), and offer magloire and kwame plus picks for kidd and collins.|`|44af8fb8ee449a42350051d4072f333faa	no they need to hire a defensive coach

He has also created a unique brotherhood with his Alumni.  They are almost a fraternity in themselves.  This book, coupled with David Halberstam's "Playing for Keeps" about Michael Jordan will give you a great background on Michael Jordan and sports in general.  "The Miracle of St. Anthony" is good as well, about Bobby Hurley Sr. and a year of coaching, he is considered by most to be one of the best coaches of all time.  Still its just a great story.  Both of Phil Jackson's latest books are interesting, he has a unique way of seeing the game and his interpersonal skills are different than what you will find in other books about coaches.  Lance Armstrong's book, "You gotta be the bike" has great things to say about goalsetting and tenacity.  John Wooden's many books are great resources as is Morgan Wooten's coaching manual.  But if you're a Michael Jordan fan, there are so many more I could name.

I believe most of the books written by coaches tend to be too cliche or too jock speak.  I read books by Coach K, Jimmy Johnson, and various other coaches, and they just are not as good at telling the story.

9fc411116ecd0e2d80639aca19649dccaa	San Antonio is a beautiful city & a lucrative market that the NFL would love to tap into. The talk of the Saints moving there is not very likely due to political pressures right now, but the future looks promising.<br>  <br>  I don't believe the NFL has any immediate plans to expand, so a relocation seems the best shot. Not sure what the previous answerer is talking about w the domed stadium, retractable roof comment.

The game will be carried live on the Big Blue Sports Network (radio) with Neil Price. <br>  <br>  <br>  Men's start on Friday against Villanova - Chicago United Center<br>  <br>  Kentucky earned its 16th-consecutive bid to the NCAA Tournament, earning the No. 8 seed in the West Region, when the tournament bracket was announced Sunday evening. <br>  <br>  The Wildcats (21-11) face a relatively unfamiliar foe in the first round when they square off with ninth-seeded Villanova (22-10) on Friday at the United Center in Chicago.

No puedo describirte exactamente los ejercicios porque siempre había un instructor que te los marcaba, pero tiene mucho que ver con la elongación. Fue creada para los lisiados de guerra y se perfeccionó mucho y ahora sirve hasta para modelar la silueta, además de tener muy en cuenta las particularidades de cada persona. (atienden como máximo 4 alumnos por vez). <br>  Como para ser estricta respecto de tu pregunta te diría que no olvides elongar los músculos cada vez que termines una rutina, parece ser muy importante. Hay un ejercicio de elongación para piernas que es simplemente: parada doblar la pierna hacia atrás y tomar con la mano del mismo lado el empeine, empujándolo hacia la cola durante algunos segundos. Para los brazos, doblar un brazo como si fueras a cruzarte de brazos y con la mano del lado contrario, tomarte por encima del codo y tirar. Otra rutina muy practicada en Buenos Aires es correr de un lado a otro, para elongar el salario y llegar a fin de mes...  jajaj|`|102614c380af9934e986eccb6d109c3eaa	El sexo es el aerobico mas completo y relajante de todos . chao.|`|aba7f643d932eae7bdfcd09c3bb6657baa	holas! tira en el piso una manta, pero que no sea muy acolchonada, tirate boca arriba, con los brazos separados a lo hombre del vitrubio, pero flexiona las piernas hasta la panza, cuando logres esa pocicion, novete te ixquierza a derecha, con los brazos siempre separados y las piernas flexionadas, es una buena postura.<br>  despues esta la postura de la vela, los brazos tambien separados y levantas las piernas, luego la zona de la cadera y espalda, tene cuidado  con el cuello.<br>  otra, que es muy buena para la celulitios, si es que tenes es caminar con la cola, te sentas en el piso y vas como caminando.<br>  suerte con los ejercicios!

rGGymoowaa	Yes some people do get carried away with sports yet at the end of the day people like to be entertained. If not sports why spend money on music, movies, or other forms of entertainment. <br>  <br>   Sports and human history go back a long ways to the earliest civilizations Mesopotamia (Euphrates-Tigris) Egypt (Nile) India (Indus) and China. Humans no longer where hunter or gathers we had the luxury of leisure time. At first there where running,boxing, and wrestling contests and then latter on ball and stick sports where invented all around the world. Since we domesticated animals horses also became a part of various sporting contests.<br>  <br>   Greece and Rome certainly took sporting contests to the next level. All through out society-history those that could entertain or do well in sporting contests where rewarded. <br>  <br>   In the 19th century you had many people coming from the countryside into the city in both Europe and North America even Japan do to the industrial revolution. This was the time sports started to be organized clubs where formed or in the USA colleges started wanting to compete against each other. People wanted to get away from their daily grind and you had the rise of spectator sports.<br>  <br>    Yes I agree public funding shouldn't be used to fund a private enterprise in some cities a majority agrees, but other areas a majority wants there tax dollers spent this way. After all USA colleges often get a boost fundraising wise when the basketball or football team does well. Call it civic pride something going back to city states of Greece and grand Roman stadiums. <br>  <br>   Lastly as a firm believer in free will I couldn't begin to tell people what they need to be concerned with. Major issues of the day will always be there and will not go away, because of sports being their form of enjoyment.|`|DfHFMEfraa	There is a great radio guy in Toronto who said that sports is a release mechanism, you sit in the stands or watch it at home, and you forget about everything else in life, same thing with tv and movies.<br>  <br>  Personally though, I enjoy my life, so while I do watch sports, I dont go crazy and miss work or get emotional when my team loses|`|inuVRaFgaa	Sports help us forget about our problems.|`|b984345da5ffc81ac67daa3ecfff2effaa	Well sports are what brings people together.

zjha18Xsaa	To be honest...I'm not sure that is a trade I would make if I were the one getting Utley and Young.<br>  <br>  Utley should without a doubt be the top 2nd baseman in the league, however, he won't put up exceptional numbers.  Honestly, when it comes to my second baseman I look for a guy that will start everyday and bat around .290....those kinds of players aren't that hard to come by.  So really, getting Utley in a deal really wouldn't be that important to me.<br>  <br>  Young has the potential to be an incredible starter, but than past experience has taught me that potential is a dangerous thing.  Young is just as his name implies.  I realize that Bedard isn't an ace of the Baltimore staff but he is quite reliable.<br>  <br>  I think the biggest thing for me is that you want too much...Hafner is among the top 10 offensive players in baseball (he'll put up better fantasy numbers than Utley, I'd guarentee it) and barring a sophomore slump, Ramirez should be a top 5 SS this year.  I actually think his numbers will look a lot like Utley's did.<br>  <br>  I definitly wouldn't trade Ray, Ramirez, and Hafner...it is easy to find a guy that will get saves, but it is dang near impossible to find one that you know will be there all season.  Ray is one of those guys.<br>  <br>  You can always propose it, and you should...it would be a great deal for you.  If he is dumb enough to do it, than you'll have one heck of a team.|`|f8d06f1d4da03948a1fa46fc0402a9faaa	I would do it. Hafner is a beast.

3c516b646d8311b3cd4460ca31e6ff04aa	Estimada Misuki: las artes marciales se convirtieron en una actividad comercial desde tiempos ancestrales, lo que destruye tanto a las organizaciones de artes marciales como a cualquier sociedad, o comunidad, es la corrupción, la falta de principios y valores morales, fue así en todos los tiempos, se puede corroborar a lo largo de la historia con cualquier organización, desde las peque?as comarcas hasta los grandes imperios, se terminaron cuando las personas que la componían cayeron en la corrupción, pero no es nuevo que desde siempre las artes marcailes movieron y mueven diariamente millones de dólares alrededor del planeta, lo que sucede es que el artista marcial queda fuera de los repartos porque esos millones de dólares que se muven gracias a los practicantes de arte marcial están la mayoría encapsulados en industrias parásitos, o sea revistas cine, ropa, etc. .Lo triste es que cuando un artista marcial reclama que su nombre se use en todos lados y el dinero se lo lleve un empresario, y se convierte en empresario además de artista marcial para cuidar sus propios intereses en vez de que alguien que no tenga nada que ver con el arte marcial lo haga, es mal visto por los artistas marciales que desearían hacer lo  mismo y no tienen la información que les permita encontrar el cómo. Entonces usan la opinión de novatos, o tergiversan esta situación que nada tiene que ver con moral o ética sino que es un fundamento comercial simplemente, haciéndoles creer que está mal, pero tampoco dejan claro a dónde va el dinero de las cuotas(claro siempre dicen que es para el gimnasio), el dinero de los torneos, del mercado de artículos afines al arte en cuestión, los seminarios, las clases especiales etc, etc, etc, estoy en la plena seguridad de que si en alguna de cualquiera de las asociaciones sin fines de lucro se pide un extracto de los ingresos y egresos siempre les dará cero, pero la realidad, que el practicante que va a poner su corazón el arte que quiere aprender, es que hay personas buscando asesoramiento porque quieren hacer mas rentable su negocio de arte marcial, lo sé porque yo soy asesora financiera, y frecuentemente llegan a nuestra institución personas que están cansadas de esa mogigatería de que el arte marcial no es para negocio, y que necesitan francamente un auxilio para seguir con sus locales abiertos, yuo lo veo estuprndo, porque mientras halla personas que se dejen de tanta hipocresía el arte marcial se va a mantener vivo, aunque la gran mayoría crea que disponer de una buena organización en las finanzas es inmoral, yo creo que lo immoral es la hipocresía, y la competencia malsana, creo que a todos los practicantes les agrada disponer de buenas infraestructuras para practicar pero para eso deben darse cuenta de que es necesario mover aún que sea un mínimo de capital como en cualquier actividad que no se sustente de la caridad. Aunque la caridad es uno de los negocios mas rentables que existen en todo el mundo. Yo dispongo de información por eso te comento que no puedo tener el mismo punto de vista de personas que carecen de información sobre a dónde va el dinero en las artes marciales, pero mientras exista esa corrupción tan arraigada y gente que les crea a los charlatanes que se atribuyen gran maestría, el arte marcial como muchas cosas en el mundo verán socabadas sus oportunidades de poder hablar de dignidad. Así como también puedo agregar que existen maestros fabulosos, y que en la medida de que el mundo valla transformándose, y el arte marcial se resguarde bajo otros parámetros administrativos y financieros, esa fórmula de que "el arte marcial no es negocio" será filtrada por el poder de discernimiento de la gente y ya no será una buena fórmula para camuflar la inmoralidad, ahí estos maestros tendrán cómo ser identificados, porque todo lo que no es genuino se extinguirá. Creo siceramente que el dinero no hace corrupto a nadie, porque por sí mismo no tiene valor ni significado, lo que importa es solamente de dónde viene y a dónde va, y eso es algo que determina el ser humano, por lo tanto sería bueno empezar por cambiar un poco el lenguaje, yo por ejemplo preguntaría porqué hay tanta gente corrupta desvirtuando al arte marcial usando al dinero para camuflar su falta de dignidad humana, porqué hay tanta gente a la que le dificulta disernir? Simplemente son procesos, y creo que hay que tener paciencia, el ser humano es como es, y es grato que pasen estas cosas para que sea posible valorar las diferencias y, lo genuino tenga oportunidad de emerger a pesar de cualquier proceso relacionado con el dinero, que como asesora financiera te puedo asegurar que en el furturo así como un día apareció un día desaparecerá, ya son mas de 30 millones de personas en el mundo sustentando sus necesidades financieras y económicas con algo llamado para-dinero, pero, como es tendencia en el mercado, tiene dos características: primero se da a nivel mundial, y segundo se desarrolla y crece sin necesidad de que todas las personas estén de acuerdo, o que el resto de los 6000 millones de habitantes que hay en el planeta la desconozcan. Es una tendencia jóven y surge gracias a los adelantos tecnológicos y ayudada por estos cada dia mas, hace tan solo 60 a?os que está en el mercado y se calcula que inclusive el mercado sudamericano será el que la desarrolle con mayor intensidad.<br>  Bueno me fui del tema pero esto de las artes marciales no es ageno a lo comentado, por eso aunque extenso me parece oportuno explicarlo. <br>  Te mando un cari?o grande.<br>  María de la Trinidad Vi?ole Donadío.|`|4gUNNwxYaa	La idea de mostrar a una persona parcialmente normal defendiendose e manera tan esplendida, es atractiva para la gente, y si una persona sabe cualquier arte marcial puede simplemente "venderla" explotarla comercialmente.<br>  <br>  Y lamentablemente todo esto lleva solo a la degradación y extinción de estas maravillosas artes|`|5TrUBA9Taa	Pues por que se ven sumamente cooool<br>  <br>  Salu2|`|7316d1abc92bc4eaf45175a5b7a74bf5aa	yo creo que por las cabronas películas que muestran a un "perdedor" pateando el culo a un magnate millonario, entonces todo mundo se tatúa un dragón y se pone a quebrar tablas, como si los arboles les hubieran hecho algo.|`|FJVBxJ2baa	para poder venderse a la gente.

DbB2yCJ7aa	I really dont know and i think they are blowing this way out of proportion. He has said things ab out hispanics, native americans, obeseity, whites and other all in jest but they never made a big deal. Suddenly when he said something about blacks they get all bent out of shape? Other radio personalities say worse things all the time, including blacks. Does it make it right that he said it? No, but a suspension was still enough punishment they did not need to drop his program. If assholes like Al Sharpton didnt always whine and cry anytime someone makes an even remotely racial (not saying that this is one of those) remarks, he is there to complain. Despite the fact that he doesnt care about all of the other races he has insulted or joked about. That is racist in itself and he needs to stop being such a hipocrit.|`|8f3ef87ae927b5ac0c18d54c01aa2862aa	Yes. He said it over the air to a national audience. That means several thousand people, at least, heard it. Irregardless, whether he said it to the entire country or just one person, it's still an ignorant, racist comment. We can't stop people like that from being racist. But we can stop them from being racist on our airwaves.|`|b3d5e01b61690541f093b9b7eaaacaf8aa	I think it would. as long as he uttered the comments that he did on air (even if it was a mistake) It doesn't matter what team you are talking about when you utter racial slurs (even in jest) about players for any college team. Words going to get out regardless of the school being mentioned is in nearby New Jersey, or out in California. Consider the size of his audience since he broadcasts out of NYC to all over the US.|`|b48f2f2c3c698450e4a6f517fc498969aa	Well, I doubt if the comment would have even been made about any team other than those who would be in the championship game.

I doubt he'll be back anytime soon.|`|LY7keO0qaa	Yeah. A big deal would still be made, although if they weren't in the championship/tournament, the 'incident' would not have happened. People that make a big deal about things like that would do it regardless of who the team is.|`|AtcZb1MNaa	Without a doubt.  I don't think any team should be demeaned like that.<br>  <br>    I want to add one point-  when Rutgers upset Duke in the Sweet 16 it was reported in local newspapers that Rutgers players were yelling when Harding from Duke was on the line for the last two free throws with .1 left.  It was justified by the New Jersey newspapers at the type of chatter which takes place or that they were making sure there was boxing out being done.  With .1 left there's no reason to worry about boxing out,  plus no Duke players were lined up on the play.  This team that everyone is making out to be well respected women have their issues as well.

ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	Your OF is up and coming, but it's not enough support to win your league, even with Pujols and A-Rod on your team. Here's what to do to improve your OF:<br>  <br>  -Garrett Atkins can get you an elite OF like Matt Holliday, Jason Bay, Vernon Wells, or Bobby Abreu on one-on-one trade. You can still have Frank Thomas to fill that UT void in the starting spot. Richie Sexson can help fill another void at OF by getting Adam Dunn, Torii Hunter, or Delmon Young on one-on-one trade instead of letting him ride the pine everyday. <br>  <br>  -If both trades are successful, you still have decent depth with Duncan as your primary backup 1B/OF, Aurilia as your super-utility player, and Dave Roberts as a backup OF.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6tD0Q5u2aa	How did you manage to get both Pujols AND ARod???

qUlyDE5Aaa	Learn how to do everything with your left hand, to build overall dexterity.  Eat with your left, write with your left, draw with your left, throw passes with your left.  Anything you do well with your right, do with your left.  Maybe you can do layups with both hands, but do you have all the same moves?  A fancy finger roll or pump fake move?  A wrist pass?  Behind the back pass?  Try and make any part of your game equally good with your left, including dribbling.<br>  <br>  You could try playing games where you only go to your left, and have to finish left handed as well.  Much like how you probably went right all the time when you were first learning the game (and some perhaps still do years later!).<br>  <br>  Giving yourself options is always a good thing.  Give it some time.  Everyone's tendency is to use their dominant hand.  I'm fortunate to be a lefty, but grow up in a world dominated by right handed people.  So I learned to write with my right.  So when I learn things, I have a choice, and can usually do most things with both.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't come along the way you'd like, there are always other options.  Developing a step back jumper.  If you check out a lot of Jordan footage, he didn't go left much, especially late in his career.  But the step back was his most lethal weapon.  This still gives you more than one weapon, and that is all you really need.  Finding a way to start each move in a similar manner, so the defender can't tell which you're going to do.|`|b48f2f2c3c698450e4a6f517fc498969aa	Continued dribbling and extra sets of drills w/ your left.  In pick-up games concentrate on going left.  Some things that I heard from the tournament from Drew Neitzal (Mich St) was that growing up hisdad made him use his off hand for everything.  Brushing teeth, eating, opening doors, etc.|`|Sj3R15iraa	Developing the skill of going left is done by applying the same drills as going right, except it's all in reverse. So, instead of stepping with the right foot first and dribbling with the right hand, you step with the left foot and dribble with your left.<br>  <br>  As you've probably thought out by now, this means that you'll also need to practice dribbling and performing layups with your left hand.<br>  <br>  It's always best to develop basketball skills with your off hand because it makes it more difficult to guard you. Even if you can start going left but then always have to cross over to your right at the basket to finish, it makes it easy for your defender to anticipate and block your shot.<br>  <br>  Larry Bird had the ability to score with either hand through layups or even jumpshots. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can shoot his sky hook with his left or right hand. As for current NBA players, Carlos Boozer has developed the skill of going strong to the basket and laying in the ball with either hand.

Proviene del Kung fu (Wing Chun es solo una de las tantas formas de nombralo, para imitar la pronunciación oriental) cuyo maestro más conocido qui?as fue Yip Man (maestro de Bruce Lee) y cuyo discípulo Leung Ting (máximo grado de Wing Tsun en estos momentos) fue el maestro del gran maestro Keith R.

Esto es la contestación a la violación de la distancia de seguridad por parte de un agresor con un ataque. Los movimientos muy directos, sin adornos y con principios como "La solución universal" permiten al alumno defender un amplio abanico de ataques en un corto espacio de tiempo de aprendizaje.<br>  <br>  Los 4 principios del Wing Tsun son:<br>  <br>  Si el camino está libre, avanza. <br>  Si chocas con algo, mantente pegado. <br>  Si su ataque es más fuerte, cede. <br>  Si el oponente se retira, continúa avanzando. <br>  <br>  Lo primero que se aprende es a dar una respuesta funcional a cualquier tipo de agresión, tratando de eliminar las reacciones causadas por el miedo. Después se van ampliando la gama de defensa y ataques, haciendo más interno el sistema.<br>  <br>  En el Chi Sao (manos pegajosas) se entrenan las sensaciones y las reacciones de un modo suave.<br>  <br>  Lat Sao es el entrenamiento de sparring."|`|8d565acdf22949f25aa2a814ab6d464caa	hola, pues por lo qaue veo eres nuevo en este arte marcial.

GyYMI9vNaa	slugging average (abbreviated SLG) is the most popular measure of the power of a hitter. It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats.<br>  <br>  SLG = (1B + (2 x 2B) + (3 x 3B) + (4 x HR))/ AB , where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player, and 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively.|`|62c73d4f4e3fb973d1175efbe209c74baa	Total amount of bases reached on hits, divided by at-bats.  <br>  <br>  Basically, it's just batting average, except a double counts as 2 hits, a triple as 3, and a home run as 4.

His slugging percentage would be 55 (total bases on hits) divided by 124 (at-bats): .444. The player averages 0.444 bases per at-bat.<br>  <br>  If he had only one at-bat and he hit a home run in that at-bat, his slugging percentage would be 4.000; he averages four bases per at-bat.|`|9OaBdwcFaa	adds up you total bases example<br>  if you get a home run your total would be 4000 each base=1000|`|JyoRQlrHaa	Batting average is the percentage of hits per (non-base-on-balls  or sacrifice) at-bats.

VU6UOmzNaa	La patada descendente apareció por primera vez en el Campeonato Mundial de TaeKwonDo (WTF) de 1973, como casi todas las patadas del TKD deportivo moderno es una modificación más rápida y de recorrido más corto que las patadas tradicionales. En este caso se trató de una patada en abanico más elevada que se bajaba a mitad del recorrido.<br>  El "arma de ataque ideal" en la patada descendente (Chigol Chagui) es el borde externo del pié (Bal Nal), sin embargo lo dificultoso de la técnica ha hecho que muchos impacten con el talón o, simplemente, con la planta del pie. La patada piede ir dirigida a la cabeza, al puente de la naríz o a las clavículas (muy usado en full contact)<br>  Dadas las exigencias que esta patada tiene (son frecuentes los desgarros musculares) lo más recomendable para aprenderla es, como ya te han dicho, ir a un gimnasio y que un instructor capacitado la ense?e y corrija|`|DnYPhPYVaa	hazte un mu?eco para practicar.<br>  Un perchero o algun tipo de soporte  y una almohada o un balon o ata una manopla con cuerda elastica a dos puntos.|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	Vicente tiene toda la razon en el procedimiento, pero necesitas guia y supervision en el calentamiento y estiramiento previos a entrenar esa tecnica.<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|9dd298b6194a53be20e42df0d539aaa0aa	ir a un gimnacio de karate ,,ahi aprenderas mucha mas que patadas,,,|`|sXKSUdJnaa	practica kung fu alli te la ese?aran a hacerla.|`|wwRXj9Kbaa	shiru   el caballero   del dragon  te la puede ense?ar|`|4gUNNwxYaa	No hay realmente una manera de aprenderla solo de practicarla, ponte en posicion de pelea, sube tu pierna delantera haciendo una forma de parentesis hacia el lado de tu espalda y luego dejala caer hacia abajo.<br>  <br>  Supongamos que tu pierna izquierda es tu pierna delantera, la subes haces un semicirculo hacia tu izquierda con la pierna izquierda, y cuando llegue hasta arriba dejala caer verticalmente.|`|6QOKrzMYaa	es dificil pero la practica hace al maestro<br>  agarra una hoja de papel ponele un hilo y colgala a la altura de tu cabeza, sube tu rodilla el pecho estira tu pierna y trata de pegarle a la hoja ten paciencia y calienta mucho tus musculos o si no te desgarras CUANDO LA DERRIBES ALA HOJA DE PAPEL CON LA PLANTA DEL PIE LISTO ESTA LA DESCENDENTE|`|P4ndOe1baa	mira yo estoy en artes marciales y una forma es ir a un lugar no c por ejemplo al parque o un lugar en la cual tengas espacio yo por ejejmplo voy a un gimnacio y ay practico toda las patadas espero q mi respuesta t sirva|`|eRmYQ8IAaa	Para aprender una patada descendente tienes que trabajar un poco duro ponte a pueba con estos tips:<br>  <br>  1.- Elasticidad<br>  deberas elevar tu pie minimo hasta tu cabeza sin casi ningun problema <br>  <br>  2.- Posicion<br>  Ponte en la posiciond e pelea y empieza a elevar el pie que se encuentra  atras ( sin doblar la rodilla)<br>  <br>  bueno espero que estos tips te sirvan pero deberas acudir a alguien que parctique algun arte marcial donde utilicen esta patada para que te le ense?e en sus diferentes formas y su correcta aplicacion|`|f93ba6acaa1716bf0daadba0bd90c9bbaa	independiente del estilo o escuela que practiques, lo indispensable es trabajar con tu elasticidad frontal, es decir, qué tan alto puedes elevar tu pierna, porque de eso depende la contundencia de tu patada.

nZbPpuOoaa	Cuidado,, tu pregunta tiende a confundir, en realidad te gustaría saber de las dos artes que mencionas cual es mas recomendable para ti, yo te recomiendo que observes clases de las dos y decidas cual es la que mas te atrae, en realidad no influye en nada tu peso o estatura para practicar algún  arte marcial, siempre existen técnicas para contra arrestar una cosa o la otra. El arte que vas a practicar solo depende de ti, nadie puede recomendarte alguna en especial ya que eres tu quien la practicara y solo tu puedes decir cual es la que te gusta. Yo pudiera recomendarte el Wu Shu ya que tiene lo mismo de pegadas de brazo y piernas, como proyecciones y estrangulamientos.<br>  <br>  Espero que puedas decidir por ti mismo y que todo te salga bien.|`|sXKSUdJnaa	te recomiendo que practiques de la dos y asi tu decides cual te gusto mas,pero en mi opinion personal no me gusta ninguna de las dos yo prefiero el kung fu ya ke el jiujitsu y el muay thai son artes marciales con reglas y en la calle no existen las reglas y en el kung fu no existen las reglas!|`|L4IuLortaa	Carnal, creo que por tu tama?o tienes un buen alcance con brazos y piernas, por lo que una tecnica como el karate do que es muy estatica no te conviene, el jujitsu es mas apto pero se basa en movimientos que tu oponente deveria realizar, pero en la calle no todo sale como esperamos, el ninjutsu... no te sirve de nada, porque no puedes andar en la calle llevando shuriken, ninjato o bombas de humo, (lastima, yo queria ser ninja) asi que te recomiendo dependiendo de donde vivas el Lima-Lama, tecnica del gran maestro Tino Tuiolosega de las islas polinecias o el poderoso krav maga de la defensa de Israel, hambas tecnicas se basan en eliminar a tu oponente de la forma mas rapida posible con ataques a los puntos vitales del cuerpo humano, rompimiento de extremidades, extrangulaciones, liberacion de sujeciones, y por supuesto pelea.<br>  Pero toma el concejo que quieras, cada quien tratara de hablar bien de la tecnica que practica, se despide shin akuma, practicante avansado de lima lama|`|Pv9NupJYaa	como defensa desde siempre el judo ha sido lo más efectivo, siguiendole el jiu jitsu (pero la version real, la japonesa); las estrangulaciones y llaves son imposibles de zafar.
