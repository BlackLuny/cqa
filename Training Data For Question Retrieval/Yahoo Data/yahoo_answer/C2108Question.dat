20090227084148AArYUBe	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Union grievance questions?	I have filed a grievance against the company I work for, for hiring a co-worker with lesser seniority and experience based on a test as per part of the application process.  The problem is with down-sizing over the next couple of years, she is in the safer unit, where the unit I am currently in is slated to shut down in about 2 years.  There will be bumping abilities for people in my situation.  But let's face it, who knows what the future will bring.  I have no problem filing the grievance, I am obviously concerned about reprisals from the company, but that won't stop me from the grievance process.  We've had a few meetings with my union rep, it will probably go to arbitration, but i've had a change of mind. I actually like the unit i'm on, the people I work with, and for other personal reasons, I don't really want to go work on the other unit.  But now I feel torn, should I carry on with the greivance since I started it, or just say thanks but no thanks, I'm currently content where I am.  Would I look like a shmuck with my union brothers and sisters.  I don't think i'm pussing out, but I feel I would be happier right here, right now.  Anybody have this happen, any insights.
20090227081405AAQciSO	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	I don't understand namings.....I'm not dumb, read the details and you'll understand.........ANSWER!!!!!â€¦	Alright, so I am a little bit confused with how you name someone in different religions/countries/ways of life. Like if you are Jewish, you get a Hebrew name. Does the name translate such as Jose=Joseph in spanish, or do the parents just pick another name that doesn't have to do with your english name? Why is naming different at every place in the world and every religion just about???? Thanks so much to everyone who answers.

20090306161826AAMZFVO	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Photos;Editing Photos	Image Editing Question for Experts!!?	I have Adobe Photo Deluxe and also Adobe 5.1le.   I open a photo of a portrait, select it, and use the circle tool to circle just the face of the person.  Then I feather the edges and dump all but the circled face.  All is well, but when I save it the blanked out part still takes space on the page.  I want to delete everything but the face I circled and feathered, so I can butt round photos against each other without the original boxes around the photos bumping into each other.  I can't butt the photos together because the part I deleted still exists and takes space.  Can you talk me though fixing this?

20090306212255AAss8ah	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Shopping	Are money orders secure?	I think I just made a sale on Craigslist. The woman purchasing my item lives quite far, and offered to send a money order & self addressed padded envelope. Are money orders a secure transition of cash? The only reason I doubt this - is that she started off her email saying "Do you believe in the honor system?"       I obviously won't send my item off without a proper transaction of cash. So wouldn't I be the one on the honor system?      Please let me know your thoughts...

20090306214324AA85WT6	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Questions about YaoiCon?	okay...yes, I plan things WAY in advance, but my friend and I (along with a couple of our guy friends) plan on attending a Yaoicon in a couple of years, first off, I was curious...do you HAVE to cosplay to attend one of these?   Second, I'm interested in cosplaying, but I don't think I have the 'build' or anything to actually do it. Not to mention I suck at sewing...I mean I can't even cook o-o much less can I sew. And I'm always seeing these things on how much people hate 'horrible cosplayers', so I'm all nervous that I might cosplay and end up being one of those 'horrible cosplayers'.   I mean...I'm really INTERESTED in cosplaying as Sora from Kingdom Hearts, but I'm nervous cause I don't think I'd do it very well...

I use this email for a listserve I am on, that sends my hundreds of emails per week/month.  I have 8000 emails in my in-box, and don't want them to keep building up.  It makes it hard to skim through and read the headings.  I don't know of an easy way to delete the entire inbox.  Gmail has a very easy way...but I can't seem to find one with Yahoo.  The only way I know to delete emails is to check the box (or click "check all" ) and hit the delete button page by page.  This is tedious.  Please help!!!!!!!!!  :)

20090306213319AAxbJCh	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	Yahoo Emails Disappeared?	I had over 1600 emails from the day I created my Yahoo! email account. Today, however, I saw that my most recent 400 had disappeared, and the "most current" email shown is from July 2008. What the heck happened to all the email I received after that date? They simply disappeared, not even in my trash. What's going on? I've searched Google and I saw that this has also happened to quite a few other people. If Yahoo! Email deletes my emails without even asking my permission first, I don't think it's such a great email site then.

He has zero feedback and it's been over 10 days. The ****** is ignoring all my calls/e-mails and is trying to forget about the auction. It really frustrates me because there were serious bidders on the auction but now nobody wants the second chance offer.      Is there nothing else I can do? This guy deserves much worse than his ebay account being banned. I lost so much money :(
