20090227025824AAhA6YB	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Can ghosts manifest themselves as a red light? (Believers in paranormal only please)?	I once saw some red light in a house we use to live in. It looked something like a laser pointer light, only slightly bigger and it was moving around on the wall kind of fast. I should note that we lived on the second floor of the duplex and the windows were completely covered, actually there was only one window in this specific room. It moved around the wall and it kind of stopped above the doorway and stayed there for a few seconds and disappeared. It was only me and two of my brothers there and none of us had a laser pointer or any other kind of light. A while later, me and my younger brother were in the bedroom (different room than the other one) one night (again windows were covered) and we were watching some kind of vampire movie and we saw that light again. This time, it didn't move around the wall like the first time. This time, it only stayed above the doorway for a while and that was it. Until a little later, we were still both lying on the bed watching that movie, and that red light was actually on the bed, right between us, moving around. We jumped off that bed and went into another room. Now even if someone outside could somehow get a laser pointer to shine perfectly fine through the window curtains and blinds, still, how would they be able to get it on the bed? Like I said, we were on the second story and if someone outside was doing it, they would be alot lower than we were, since they would be on the ground. How would they be able to shine the light from the ground outside, to a bedtop on a second story floor, with no mirrors in the bedroom? Not likely at all. The house was kind of old, as well. The landlord said it was built in the very early 1900's. My mind wants to say he said it was 1907, but I'm not sure. And it's built along a historic street here, so considering the age of the house and the historic street, it probably has some history with it. There was also a couple of other minor things that's happened, but I won't describe them right now.

20090227024727AAWkBpq	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	How can I recover (from the following incident that is adequately recounted below)?	I recently had a very peculiar and heart-wrenching encounter. Let me explain. I was recently fortunate enough to collect enough spare change from the church collection tray and my street stints as a hobo to be able to afford a trip.  I decided to holiday in Vanuatu - a short 2yr cruise among the tropical alligators - with my pet Goldfish (Hitler Rhianna Monroe), when I noticed on a chilly October afternoon, that my scarf had gotten stuck in a senile gentlemans coat pocket.  Suffice to say that the old (did I mention blind?) gentleman did not notice.  When he took off his jacket that night before undressing to take a cold and wrinkly shower, I was mistakenly folded up in his suitcase with his clothes. Suffice to say that his loving wife was not pleased, after a golden marriage of 3mths (she was a local Vanuatuan hooker).  Anyway my night and following morning was perfect until I realised upon turning on the television in his cabin, that George Bush had gotten lip implants.  It was the most revolting thing in the world to eyewitness observe through the television...I mean imagine it, the 'BEFORE PHOTOS'!!!! How on earth can I recover from that George Bush incident????!!!

Provided the person had a life sustaining space suit of some kind; If you placed a person in absolute dead space (this universe,but NO particles,planets,matter of ANY kind in it) with NO momentum what-so-ever (a dead stop/no direction), (a) would he be able to make himself move?, (b) If he couldn't "make" himself move, is there any reason he would not stay in that EXACT location in space forever? (c) let's say the man couldn't/didn't move his body by his own "will" at all, would he STILL stay in that exact same spot?   And if he can move (go from 1 point in space to another), what would be making him move? Why?      (same physics and laws as this universe, but absolutely dead empty space except for him)   I know this is a kinda' stupid, obviously hypothetical question, but it just floated through my head and got curious.
