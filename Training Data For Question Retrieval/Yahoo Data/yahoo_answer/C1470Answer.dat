MYO2k9EUaa	Supposedly, vampire's huge two front fangs are hollow, so they can suck up your blood through the hollow of their fangs, with their natural suction, I guess. <br>  <br>  Vampires don't take a bite out of a person, so it wouldn't make any sense for them to put their whole mouth on a person.<br>  <br>  No, I am not a Twilight fan. I hate the series.|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	Normal Vampires don't sparkle.|`|AzkEtvdcaa	Yes; however, according to olf folklore vampires had large, retractable fangs that, when they bite someone, their fangs would go deep into the skin making the holes signifigantly larger than in the movies so the blood could be sucked through them. <br>  Also, when you get a cut, even if it's just a surface wound, the blod surfaces to reach oxygen. So when a vampire bites a human the blood surfaces from those little holes and pretty much runs into the vampires mouth.|`|1IMGx7Hsaa	remember, its just a movie. usually,yes there is 2 visible marks of 2 rows of teeth.|`|XUkYVp3Uaa	The whole legend is unrealistic. Teeth aren't like butterfly proboscises. They can't suck.|`|tjRuKlJaaa	yea i guess so if you think about it...lol
1yGDFTieaa	Yes, it does!<br>  I work with children so when a child snatches something, I always say "can you hand that to me nicely please?", when they do I say "Did you notice how I took it out of your hand? I didn't snatch, did I?"<br>  Then I pass the child the item & they take it without snatching.<br>  <br>  I always do it with adults too, no need for bad manners.|`|54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Yeah, especially, as the kids around here do, they'll say, "Yoink" when the snatch it. And ya can't smack a kid like you could in the good old days... lol|`|avfJI5CGaa	I sometimes do that. XD  I don't mean to, though I just do it. Yes, snatching bothers me.|`|uvgXHrSYaa	Yea especially when its mine|`|loqsl5xXaa	yes!!|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Yes. That is extremely rude. My dogs are better behaved than that.
phCB66n1aa	Yes, but no one cares.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	yes of course becasue it's gonna make a sound anyway|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I think it would still make a sound, but it wouldn't be audible because nobody would be there to hear it.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	Yes, since as it falls and bangs into other objects, this causes a disruption in the air molecules surrounding the tree and whatever it hits. This disruption, or vibration, in the air is sound, and is produced whether or not you are there to hear it.|`|WLPDJ3Npaa	Actually, no.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Human and animal eardrums turn the vibrations into what we call sound.<br>  <br>  If recorded and played back to us however, we would hear the sound.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Of course it does. There's just no one around to hear it. What a stupid debate...|`|5JG4GDM0aa	Yes, it would make a sound. Just because no one is there to hear it doesn't mean its quiet. A tree isn't gonna be like, 'i'm not gonna make a sound cuz someone isn't there' or because someone is. it doesn't make a difference whos there and who is not. It still makes a sound.|`|dbJlZ4qCaa	NO because a sound is vibrations in the air which travel to the ear and is deciphered  by the brain so if no one is around to hear it it is technikly not a sound|`|hmEhHbNhaa	My mom says it doesnt because the vibrations need to go through our ears to make the sound.<br>  <br>  I personally do think it makes a sound.but what do i know??im only 12
YupMCYHlaa	Yeah, color TV was one.  A car with air conditioning.  An SLR camera.  A BMW motorcycle.  A tape recorder!  A refrigerator with a separate door for the freezer and an icemaker!  Believe it or not, an electric typewriter.  I never believed I'd ever own a house until I was in my 30s.  And when I was a kid, I never thought I'd own a computer.  8^) <br>  <br>  A few years ago I was lucky enough to get to borrow a little boy, the grandson of a friend, as a sort of adopted nephew. I'd pick him up one Saturday a month and take him to a zoo or a museum or something.  He lived in a little apartment all his life and he was shocked to see that we had our own washer and dryer.  He thought we must be really rich.  He also thought only rich people ate in restaurants.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Like you, color TV (which I never even knew existed till I was a young adult) dishwasher.  Never wanted the fur coat.  Oh, yes.  Also, air conditioning.<br>  <br>  I am middle class, and I have all those things, and more.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Impeccable table manners, maids, chauffeurs, chefs, servants. I never got any of these but I did develop table manners that are acceptable in most settings. Later in life I was happy that I never acquired any of these.|`|8G42oyydaa	A boat, to play recreational sports, happiness, love, fun, vacations somewhere other than at relatives, a cabin at the lake, new clothes, central heating, friends, pretty much everything..|`|XEbrGfZuaa	When I was a kid, and it was long before knowing about TV existing,<br>  I heard about rich people taking ocean cruises to Europe on ocean<br>  liners. And we'd see famous people on news reels at theatre's on<br>  board ships occasionally. So I never thought anyone not rich, could<br>  afford to go on a vacation aboard one. Especially when people in our<br>  neighborhood, only took fishing or beach vacations. Every dad was<br>  mostly a blue collared worker. Although my dad worked in an office.<br>    Another thing, I thougt only rich people did, was to stay at fancy<br>  hotels. When we'd go away, we only stayed at a motel. I've never<br>  taken an ocean cruise, or stayed in a fancy hotel. So there must <br>  be something to my thinking, back then. LOL.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	I thought rich kid's had Nannies, a cook and a maid.<br>  <br>  Someone to mow the lawn.<br>  <br>  We were poor - but my mom had a fur coat - but so did most moms have at least a fur collar on her coat.<br>  <br>  Lucky me - I have never envied the rich - just happy to be here.<br>  DeeJay.|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	Take a vacation . I never got to go anywhere until after i graduated from high school and got married later in 1961.20 years old at the time.|`|39rXZUeQaa	When I was five years old I thought I could change the world.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I came from a fairly well to do home. <br>  I wanted to be like Woody Guthrie but I wouldn't have plagiarized him the way the very well to do back then Bob Dylan did.|`|nwnILcEAaa	A dining room.|`|AA11296212	A new car.|`|AA11767291	A pool. That's not the case though. Yes I did get it.|`|gCAJaFnyaa	I thought rich people had swimming pools in their backyard, drove Cadillacs, vacationed in FL in the winter, belonged to the country club, lived in big houses, travel to Europe.<br>  My parents got a portable dishwasher when I was 16, a color TV when I was a freshman in college, and window air conditioners after I graduated.<br>  <br>  Today, I feel that I live and have lived a comfortable life, and don't really wish for much.  Although my husband and I have our list of what we want to do before we get too old to do it.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Do you know how embarrassed I am to answer this???????<br>  <br>  When i was a kid I was with my mother in a department store on an escalator. I actually asked my mother "What do they do when the basement gets full of steps"?<br>  <br>  I was in a grocery store, and years ago they used to have missing children on milk cartons (remember that?)  I asked my mother, "if the kid is missing, why is she smiling?"<br>  <br>  But the stupidest thing I remember saying and please do not take offense I was a little boy. Back in Baltimore I use to see a lot of black children in the streets, I actually thought it took black people less than 9 months to have a child. I am dead serious.<br>  <br>  All three of these are the truth.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	I don't recall knowing anyone rich as a child.  It seemed were all in the same "class". People didn't flaunt their wealth if there was any and there must have been.  <br>  I wanted a horse for many years, every birthday I'd ask for one.  Didn't get one then and don't have one now. Guess my parents knew then as I know now.|`|AA10528299	actually, we didn't even KNOW we were poor until someone pointed it out to us, LOL - so I guess we thought we had as much as everybody else did. After that, about the only thing I wished we had was a car, so my Mom wouldn't have to walk to work.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	As I was reading, I thought..."color t.v.!!!"...We were raised in a rural area, farms for miles in every direction.  We spent all our time outside, no time for t.v.  The other "item of the wealthy" was A/C!|`|24vQ8D71aa	nice clothes, a house. all the MATERIAL things.|`|AxtRjMlGaa	Travel all over the world. Still working on it.|`|mzXnweedaa	i thought how cars moved|`|2Ta73Ejtaa	Holidays away from home<br>  A car<br>  A house<br>  Clothes|`|YGezJAXGaa	i thought my house had a Ghost closes|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I had everything the rich people had only in a cheaper form.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	Air condition and for that matter way back when, inside plumbing.

aa0863fc5d2debdae1309819be399f5faa	I'd suggest checking with local churches, fire halls, recreation centers, or schools.  I think we could be more helpful if we perhaps knew your general location though!|`|wo8n1Xgkaa	If there is no liquor involved, a church hall
7gH7sgi6aa	Do NOT call again.  I would consider going to the establishment in person.  They are NOT ignoring your calls and it is much harder for someone to say "No" in person than it is on the phone.  Be sure to make clear that you need this for graduation and you will not be in any ones way.  Smile, be polite and professional.  Look neat and professional.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|AA11788494	I would call again and tell someone about your trouble with getting a hold of her on the phone.  Ask someone if it is better to schedule an appointment with her in person.
O7SshRl6aa	I also would prefer to have the bathroom empty or full and bustling with activity, so my sounds don't stick out.  However, if you're sitting on the potty and waiting for Slowpoke to leave, you could always just reach behind you and flush the toilet to coincide with the noise you need to make.  A good timing of flushing/pooing should leave you feeling fairly comfortable about the whole thing.|`|avfJI5CGaa	Noises and smells are implied with public restrooms. It's gross, but people should expect it in bathrooms. I however am self-conscious, and I HATE public restrooms. I try to use the bathroom at home whenever possible.|`|AA11788494	If you really have to go then go.  If you can wait without an accident then wait.  But who's to say when someone else will just walk in there too.  So I would just fill the toilet with some paper and go.|`|soKNqDd3aa	Let er rip.Youre not in there to impress anybody.|`|teIblDHiaa	For #1-- just go!!<br>  For #2-- I suggest waiting. Or fill the toilet with some toilet paper so that when you go, it won't make noise. If you really have to go, then just go. But don't get out until she's gone. That would be embarrassing.
84345fb35cbddd4e220aff8b3e3849d6aa	U are definitely from East Europe or Middle East<br>  I'm guessing Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, Moldova...<br>  Or even Turkey, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	Of course, the fact that one is not born in America does not mean that she does not look American, and of course, it is not plain from looking at your picture that you're not American.  In fact, it seems likely that you live somewhere around Chicago.  In any event, you look American to me.  <br>  <br>  However, given that you're not, I suppose one would guess from your skin coloring (which appears to me to be on the lighter side) and from your facial features that you were born in either Canada or northwestern Europe.  However, to be more specific, I'd be throwing darts at a map.  I suppose I could try to extract another clue from the "I speak more than one language" statement you made, which would make me look to countries in which multiple languages are commonly used (like Canada, Belgium or Switzerland), but again, I'd only be guessing.<br>  <br>  It's tough to guess a person's nation of origin from a photograph.|`|nsx7FfDkaa	I'm thinkin' Jamaican, or Chinese, but it's hard to tell consitering I didn't look at the pics lol<br>  <br>  <br>  but in all seriousness, I think ur russian, I live in a russian community and a lot of girls look like you:)|`|BXgBZ5KVaa	aww youre cute<br>  humm maybe russian or like in the western part of europe|`|Te9odBWCaa	Well, you look very much European.

People with schizophrenia are not the kind of people one whould need to take a stand against.  Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder, mabye you should get a psychiatric assessment to see why you have a deep down need for using certain people as scapegoats.<br>  <br>  Here is my analysis, you can have it for free.  You were teased as a child for being black, you feel some kind of insecurity in your racial phenotype.  <br>  <br>  The fact that you are alone and with out African American female companion is a sure sad state of affairs, becaue just based on the numeric facts you should already have a black women, especiallly a profesional black women who is educated and very loyal.  Maybe your are not familiar with the statistics but many black males are incarcerated, and the number is very dispoorporshinate to the per capita population count, which is evidence of institutional racism, anyways...YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH COMPETION! So we all know why your are single it is because there is something about your that a professional black women despises.  Anyways back to your question.<br>  1. Sarah Palin did not keep her legs closed, she has had several vaginal deliveries (4 kids or more)<br>  2. Sarah Palin is not professional, she is unethical which negates professionalism. 3.  Somehting is wrong with Sarah Palin, What kind of person needs to transfer college 6 times or more?  Why wasn't she supervising and educating her daughter, now her daughter is a teenage mother.  She gets all that state welfare when her Mom charges the state money to move her back and forth around Alaska.<br>  4. How come she was pregnant with her first child before she was married, again evidence that she does not keep her legs closed.<br>  HOMOSEXUALS ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST THEM!  I AM A VETERAN, I SERVED MY COUNTRY, AMERICA IS ABOUT FREEDOM AND EQUALITY, AND THEREFOR I BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THEIR SEXUALITY, BUT YOU DO HAVE TO AGREE THAT THEY ARE AMERICAN AND DESERVE EQUALITY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

(i dont know the details i didnt go to the link) and the gay people at the parade should be ****** ashamed of themselves. all that shows is that all the bullshit they put up with hasnt meant anything because the day im ridiclued, beaten or harassed just for being bi...will not be the day i take it out on straight people that had nothing to do with it. thats very ****** up.|`|wZ8HmrA2aa	No one should be forced into something like that, it's a choice to be made by the individual.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  If you are interested about learning Wicca and/or Witchcraft here are a few legitimate sources to glean knowledge from. One being Witchvox at <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/.</a> Here you will gain knowledge through fellowship with other of like mind and knowledge through the countless articles posted. If this is not enough one could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at <a href="http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour..." rel="nofollow">http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour...</a> or OZ Wicca at <a href="http://www.ozwicca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozwicca.com/</a> , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web.<br>  <br>  Also if you are close enough to a group that specializes in education and development like the SCWF try and join them even if it’s on a limited capacity. Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.<br>  <br>  I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. Also you cannot go wrong with anything by Scott Cunningham.<br>  <br>  If you are teen, I suggest Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf and Elements of Witchcraft: Natural Magick for Teens by Ellen Dugan.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|IJ17xFAXaa	Sorry,<br>  <br>  but Wicca is a "club" for wanna-be-witches. The stuff they do won't work, unless they have a psychic or traditional witch present. I would ty to become a psychic, that is cool!!!|`|cbY6NoHSaa	Just tell him its for research. Wicca isnt bad i wish ppl would stop thinking like that. its nature! Parents + gay= disowned so dont feel to bad
mXUKca6naa	...we have a better lifestyle to enjoy...|`|GrqsnWtiaa	I wouldn't say its lower, Its just different, depends on the student, i excelled in writing and reading so the teachers placed me in AP (Advanced Placement) classes, my other friends not as reading/writing savy as iam were in lower classes.|`|Gj0zOqTyaa	It's just the way the education system works.  The ages people enter and leave, what's on the syllabus, exam difficulty, teaching style... Every nation has it's own education system and the US one is rated particularly poorly, that's all.  Britain and Denmark I believe are thought of as having two of the worlds finest.|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	Laziness on the kids and teachers part.

eGtZXgRHaa	I wouldn't date a younger girl... I prefer older women :P Like I am 21, and I tend to be attracted to 25-30 girls... Oh and I had a crush on a 40 years old woman once... oh god she was so f**king hot ! lol So I don't really have an "age limit" to date... as long as she still has a young heart :) Oh and did I say I like butch girls ? :D|`|2DahzSWvaa	I actually have a thing for older ladies, and by older I mean 25-27. HA, I'm a teenager, and I couldn't see myself dating anyone younger than me. I'm immature enough at my age, I couldn't risk being with someone even MORE immature than myself.<br>  <br>  I think with the whole attraction to older women, I could just see them taking care of me. You know, a nice ham & cheese sandwich when I get back to my dorm. That's my type of woman.|`|lO5CCIB5aa	hey,<br>    well idk, every ones different. i think its cause there more miture and developed. well my limet is that as long as there older than 5th grade and younger than college im good with them. how old are u?  sorry im not trying to be stalkerish if it seamed that way. i was just asking.|`|Fac7qW8haa	I don't think it matters, really. If you like someone, I doubt you'll ask for their ID first :p<br>  And although I prefer dating slightly older than me, my current crush is a year younger.|`|E6bKH0UAaa	i've dated both younger and older.<br>  i think the attraction with an older woman...<br>  has to do with control.<br>  and being taken care of.<br>  i definately like an older woman.<br>  :)|`|wZ8HmrA2aa	I've dated women older than me, and younger than me. I like the older women better because they're more mature :)<br>  <br>  But obviously some like them younger, or none of us would ever have dates!!|`|aYqCb3olaa	I like younger men, cause I tend to baby them haha, and I like women my age or a little younger.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	I haven't noticed that...<br>  Well, I like people around my age.<br>  Maybe one or two years in both directions.|`|u04pBBq3aa	I would date someone between 17-25 lol a little older but no way younger lol|`|nkpj18xjaa	im 18<br>  my age limit<br>  18-25|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Hmm.

Older I wouldn't have as much in common with, and younger is a little pervy.|`|Y9qTbFFraa	I'm 14 and i haven't found anyone younger than that in person lol but i dated a 16 year old guy lol that's oldest i've dated out of both men and women lol oldest girl i dated is 14 lol so i guess i like older and same age lol|`|rCzKCCDJaa	im  16 and ill date<br>  <br>  15-19<br>  <br>  :]|`|xCfub799aa	I'm 19 and my boyfriend is 15.<br>  <br>  Oh, so I get two thumbs down for been with the one I love do I?

FATyhyZ2aa	Your brother's murder explains why, at the time, you chose the lesser of 2 evils.  But now when you see that you would not have given her that option had it not been for fear of her life, admit that you were wrong.  My kids were always forgiving or understanding if I made a rule that I had to retract b/c it was based on emotion as opposed to their well being.  I'd explain why I was wrong, give my new decision & explain why that was better. / You should speak w/ the boyfriend's parents B4 you make decisions for them by allowing him to stay the night. / Are you ready for your daughter to be sexually active?  As long as she lives in your home, it's still your choice.  If you do not accept that choice, inform her there are alternatives such as emmancipation or foster care.  And then inform her what the consequences of those choices are.  Just remain calm & let her decide & be prepared to let her go if you have to.  /  Emancipation consequences are that she will have to make it on her own w/o your help, but she is always welcome to move back in to your home if she accepts your rules.  Foster care options are that once she is in the system, she may not be allowed to exit when she wants to.  Foster parents may be worse than home; could be abusive; may not care for her & have the lax rules she wants but not the love you feel for her.  Explain that you'd rather her stay w/ you b/c you love her & want her to stay, but only if she's willing to let you finish your job as a resposible mother.  To let her make the rules means you don't love her enough to do the best thing for her ( explain that to her - it's not my opinion of you). / My mother taught me that I had to love my children enough to let them hate me.  Thank God I listened, b/c now, as adults, I could not be more proud of their love & devotion to me.  I bless them all the time for their honor, help, advice, concern & LOVE.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	I think you should talk to her and explain her calmly how worried you were, especially with all that murder thing... (sorry by the way..)<br>  <br>  Maybe if she wanna spend the night with her boyfriend she could do it at your home ? Because, even though you don't like the idea, your daughter probably has a sexual life already, so she's gonna do it anyway, with or without your consent. Better let her do it safe at home than anywhere else don't you think ?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little angel/demon daughter :P|`|elH6amrVaa	yes you did the best you could. you should do a curfew for her, even tho shes 17 she still lives in your house. your house = your rules.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Yes, I understand completely. But kids are going to do what kids do no matter HOW much you try to control them. Obviously, your daughter KNEW you'd probably say "Absolutely not" if she asked if she could stay over at her boyfriend's. It's that old "better to ask forgiveness than ask permission" thinking.<br>  <br>  But that does bring up a question: how well do you and your daughter communicate? Do YOU she feels comfortable coming to you and talking about adult issues? Some parents have a very low-stress, mutual respect for their kids which allows an easy and open exchange of thought and feeling. Other parents seem hellbent on controlling every aspects of their kid's lives which makes the child distant and resentful. Trust me, you daughter has NO IDEA what you've sacrificed to provide her with a warm home, comfortable clothes, healthy meals and sound guidance. But you can't really use that as leverage against your daughter. After all, that IS the responsibility of a parent, is it not?<br>  <br>  Your daughter knows about your brother's death, does she not? She probably thinks you need to "get over it" but unless she has actually gone through something like that, she may never understand your deep fear of losing someone else who is close to you.<br>  <br>  I think you were OK with telling her in no uncertain terms "my house, my rules." And she probably resented that, too. But until someone holds down a job, maintains a home, raises kids and stays SANE all in the process, one takes it for granted.<br>  <br>  You did OK. Don't sweat it. I think this world could use with a little more tough love.|`|ng8ILmkOaa	ummm.....I am only 19 but I totally understand what you did.....you are a mother and my mom always tells me " u never know hoa a mother feels until u step in her shoes"........BUT I think u should talk to your daughter about sex and make her aware of the consequences...good luck....you seem like a great mother|`|aWPmvPpfaa	ok, you had plenty of answers......i hope you come back to our section, you seem really nice. :)|`|qGVBxZZOaa	It's understandable.<br>  You should probably just talk to her about what was going through your mind, then she'll undderstand the importance of just one reassuring phone call.|`|wZ8HmrA2aa	That's not really wrong of you, you're a worried parent. You did alright :)|`|SAceGS46aa	I think you did good but maybe talk to her about sex and tell her how you feel.

If you do it in the later stages, it's more complicated and most states won't even do it if it's really late (third trimester).   Abortion is not an easy way out.  It's a lot of money, and cause damages to YOU.  Trust me, i've done research.  I actually don't even believe in abortion... =/<br>  <br>  I think you should give the baby up for adoption.  There are MANY couples who would be more than happy to adopt a child because they can't have a child of their own. It would make them very happy.<br>  <br>  But anyways,... keeping this as a secret is a surely going to bite you in the *** eventually.  Just come clean, and find a solution that is best for you.  <br>  <br>  read up!!!!  <br>  If you want abortion, read up on the consequences.<br>  if you decide to keep the baby,... read how to take care of a baby and be a good mother.<br>  <br>  all the best<br>  <3|`|zRc4Swewaa	What's done has been done.If I were in your place I'll tell my parents that I'm pregnant and tell the whole truth about the father.I don't agree with abortion and that's your destiny,you have to accept it and be responsible with what has been done.The father can't take the responsibility because you don't know who he is.Start a new life with your baby and i don't agree with adoption also.Look at the future in the bright side and this will be hard for you and with your parents in the beginning but you'll get over it.Be strong because you have a baby inside you and do your very best for you and for your baby.Goodluck.
Wy0lUjP9aa	Are you sure your not me? I am 17 and we are exactly alike, to being shy to hate when it is time to pick partners. Because you have to have the teacher to find a partner or put you in a group. When people say what did I do over the weekend. I say watch my nephews or something boring. I couldn't wait until I became 18 because I could be friends with older people. <br>  <br>  Then, just recently, I entered this trade school (Well today I got kicked out because they said I wasn't a graduate, I am currently trying to get back in) and I decided, Hey I was the quiet shy girl for 12 years in school, now it is time to change. So first when I started, I was quiet and alone. And my classmates noticed. And this week I started talking to everyone, joking around and now I feel more comfortable. They are actually shocked that I am talking. Like when this one girl (she is 27) said she missed me because I wasn't in their cooking group anymore, and I was like "Yeah, I remember when we use to laugh together." And we started laughing. I just get out of my comfort zone and people like it they said. So I am going to do this more often and then I will finally break out of it.<br>  <br>  You need to do it too. You will be so happy with yourself and comfortable. It will make you have more confidence and that wil get you a boyfriend in the future, not only that, plently of friends. So just for one day, just act like how you do at home (because like me, I know you are not quiet at home) at school. And watch how many people will talk to you and accept you more, I bet you. <br>  <br>  Just try it, one day. And then if you don't like it never do it again.<br>  <br>  Also, you are pretty, I don't know what you look like, but everyone is pretty in someone elses eyes, you just never found that person yet.|`|p4A3EIHnaa	You need to let people get to know you. Be a bit more out going, join a few clubs or teams at school and get to know people. <br>  <br>  Be proud of who you are and flaunt it. Create respect for yourself.|`|00cAPbToaa	Im kind(or was) going through the same thing, im so quit at school and never participate in class discussons etc. and then when i got home i let  my true self shine and be all wild and hyper and cool, but at school im a whole diffirint person,why?i dont quit know.I think its because im afrai of being judge for some odd reason?? But i have been trying my hardest and i often try to start a conversation with the person sitting beside me and im joining a sport, all this is helping my sociol life and i think you should try it too. Results will; slowly show dont exept  to be the coolest person in the block the next day or week, haha, just try your hardest or else you will look back as an adult and regret not enjoiny your school life :)<br>  Best of Luck!!!!|`|Gj0zOqTyaa	Don't worry you'll be fine - I'm 17 too so I know how tough teenagerness (think I invented a word there) can be.  Until year 9-10 I was super shy - now I am not so bad.  Just try talking to people, take deep breaths before you meet someone new and act yourself.  Until year 10 I only had a small group of friends due to my crippling shyness, but by the end of year 11 I was friends with half my year.  Just be yourself.  I did, and now I can have a chat with any random guy or gal should the need call, although I am still quiter than most.|`|BXgBZ5KVaa	listen it was my first day of highschool and i was scared out of my pants<br>  it was a new school and i only knew a few people and it started out pretty rough<br>  this girl named hanna my neighbor told everyone in the grade that i was annoying<br>  everyone. before i even got to know them they judged me which sucked bad<br>  and guess what? a year later all of the girls stopped liking hanna and finally got to know me and now we are all really close<br>  high school is supposed to make you feel stupid...idk but all because you havent had a boyfriend that doesnt mean that you will never have one<br>  i have never had a boyfriend and my first hookup was at this tenn club with a guy i didnt even know and im the the tenth grade<br>  <br>  you just need to start feeling more confident, not just acting like it. i was afraid to put myself out there but i did and it benefited me later on<br>  but you cant let people like that intimidate you. they are not worth it<br>  they get friends because they are outgoing and put themselves out there and since they are pretty people i guess are naturally drawn to them. i dont know why high school is the way it is but once you start living it, it can be great. just make an effort to talk to more people <br>  and there is someone for everyone :)|`|o4F1v1mqaa	I was just like you in school. But don't worry LIFE GETS SO MUCH BETTER. But just to speed up the process, you should try being more outgoing. I know that's what worked for me. I was so shy at school yet so ME at home. Just try acting the way you do at home (like yourself) at school, a little more and more everyday. And then one day you'll realize that it's so much better to just show everyone who you really are, and you'll start to gradually see how accepting ppl can be of that.|`|mXUKca6naa	...do your best in all your endeavors, love has a habit of hitting when you least expect it...|`|AA12027265	Hun, don't worry about it too much. I was just like that. Yeah, I'm still the quiet one, and just never that talented socially-speaking (lol), but it IS a lot better than it was when I was younger.<br>  <br>  Eventually you learn how to at least seem approachable enough for others to talk to you. To walk into a room with at least a slight smile and make eye contact, and keep the contact (not exactly a direct stare...just look back at them) with someone you sit down by long enough to just say hi. Maybe a how are you.<br>  <br>  Also, most others grow up enough and don't take the quietness thing so personally. Some likely will still and regard you as someone they can't approach, but whatever. Most get over it if they at least see that you won't bite.<br>  <br>  I promise it probably won't be as bad when you are older! : )
WeNWlYT4aa	Yes, and there's one right behind you btw|`|NEd2wsK3aa	Ich weiss nicht.|`|ibR6jJgHaa	no, but I saw a ufo once...but that was about...7yrs ago|`|2Lv37jg1aa	no because I dont believe in ghost but I think it would be cool.

dy28ZUsYaa	Yes, I do. I have wished that so for so very long. If they had never been brought to the USA, THEN, there would be no more racism, dopers, crackheads, hoods, deliquents, miscreants, crooks, thieves, muggers, robbers, car jackers, home invaders, rapists, arsonists, murderers, bullies, droupouts, losers, liars, and thugs.   There WOULD be a beautiful functioning public school system and a clean, vibrant and safe urban city center in every major American city today.|`|TkS3ttSvaa	Wow, interesting question. I guess I've never put much thought into that. Although, the first people to take Africans from their country were the Spanish, who then, sold many in Cuba. That's why there are so many black people in Cuba, Dominican Republic, etc. I was also shocked to learn that many Africans actually sold other Africans to Americans who came to Africa looking for slaves. If one of their fellow Africans owed them money, they would just make a deal with the American, and the American would pay them for the person. Pretty cutthroat stuff. But, to answer your question, lol, no I have never wished that Africans weren't brought here.|`|nPOS9d9Waa	yea umm lexy.. or whatevs ya name is..dont take this in a rude way or anything and im not being racist towrads white ppl either cuz im mixxed wit black and white too..but not ALL white ppl are nice..i hav 2 liv in missouri rite now for about another three months and im the only black kidd in my skool and all these white kidds are callin me a ****** n stuff so i been gettin into a lot of fist fights an kickin their a**es..yea so dont jump to conclusions sayin that all white ppl are nice cuz most of them arent..|`|cBNm64u4aa	no bcos i dont want 2 be in africa BOOTY CLAPPING and living in a invested aid HUT<br>  <br>  i like america bcos wite ppl r nice and sweet 2 me<br>  im mixed wit black an dhwite<br>  and i get duh best of both worlds<br>  dont hate cos im cute holla|`|GWgMx6moaa	i say kinda omfg wtf am i saying yes i wish they were gone becuz they r rude ubnoctios pigs who think they r better than white people like when my friend took her baby brother 2 go bannanas these group of black girls just cut her without even asking and then they called her a stupd white girl and then later on in the big place where you play around those poor kids were pushing and scaring her brother and hiz foot got stuck in the hole and it took 5 min 2 get him out cuz he waz crying so bad and grrrrr ugh  I HATE FUCKIN BLACK PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!

He/she won't last long.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	I don't think it the fact that the white man took Africans to America but more about why that worries me. I have a big problem with the why part. It also annoys me that the lack of respect for people of colour is still so obvious and in this day and age it shouldn't even be an issue. I live in Australia and our government has apologised to the Aboriginal people for the past wrongs that where done to them by the white men. It was a proud day for me as an Australian. I believe that your government should recognise their wrongs and apologise for what they done. It may have been a long time ago but the history is still there and people still see the African Americans as lesser that the white man. I think it sucks.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Um...I don't know. But you should be lucky you're living in a great country. This is all cause they had slavery and stuff. But what they did to the slaves wasn't good.

o5Tb8ZQ0aa	voodoo is a mixture of cultural beliefs. voodoo is originally from Africa and came with the slaves...however, the slave owners thought it was devil worship and banned them from practicing it. In turn the slaves refused to give up their religion but coated it in christian beliefs so no one would figure out they were actually still practicing voodoo. My old army roommates mother was a voodoo priestess and yes I do believe it can work on who the aim is against. Same with Santeria, the hispanic version of christian coated voodoo.|`|T9m0YQgFaa	yep it's real.<br>  anyone can learn/believe it in, so yes it can effect anyone too.|`|Dt3AkTgmaa	Here is a good book for you:<br>  <br>  "The Haitian Vodou Handbook" by Kenaz Filan|`|qDYzdz5daa	*shrug*<br>  <br>  All I can tell you is that it doesn't work on me.  People have tried.<br>  <br>  But then again, I'm not exactly normal.  Not superhuman, mind you... just not normal.  I have no superstitions.  I may have been born without the capacity for faith.

Anyone with half a brain knows that any military campaign in a place like Gaza is not going to be neat and tidy. Nor were we surprised when Israel went into Gaza to stop the rocket attacks.<br>  <br>  Your arguments are weak, so you have to drag religion into the picture in an attempt to slur their character. Fail.|`|xZBwnrGzaa	No offense, but most of the stuff you said has NO truth behind it. You see us Jews following the Sabbath every Saturday. Christians and Muslims were the ones that rewrote the Torah. We have never killed our prophets. We fought your false prophets.<br>  We Jews have lived in discrimination all the way since the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians. And now, now that we have our country, our people, and our culture finally reassembled since the Holocaust, terrorists and neo-Nazis come in and destroy our lives.<br>  But our Messiah will come. It was not Jesus. It was not Muhammed. The Messiah will stop wars and death and suffering and restore Israel. He will come. He will save us all.<br>  I hope for you. I hope you repent for your sins. The slander of an entire religion. The religion that started the idea of monothiesm. The religion that Christianity and Islam is based off of. I hope your people repent for the ruthless murder of my people. I hope for you.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	I am pretty sure I would retaliate with every ounce of savagery if some group launched rockets against me.|`|AFNiSC6eaa	If some satanists came into your house and tried to reform you would you fight back?

Give me One example.<br>  <br>  Ok now let me tell you something about the catholic society. Before Catholism took over rome it was a much better place. They had running water (hot and cold) Advanced architectural science, they had virtually no racism in there community, they were very healthy people with a high literacy rate and good social bonds. This was all around 50 B.C. They had also just created the steam engine when Catholism struck. All the Scientific Records were burned because they were "anti christ" and any new scientific activity or research was generally frowned upon. For a very long time anyone that made a suggestion like "maybe the earth revolves around the sun" was outcasted from the community and often executed.|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	eh, i think most ppl don't really give a crap about that part of the world.<br>  <br>  their all fanatics.|`|4INE794zaa	None of the savagery that comes out of the Middle East surprises me anymore........|`|lDEGaK7Laa	This conspiracy theory is obviously fake and obviously anti-Semitic.
21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	If you don't want others to know, I'd keep quiet for the moment. The moment you're out of the closet to one persno you run the risk of being out of the closet to others.<br>  <br>  Why does she need to know your sexual orientation anyway?  If you're wanting to be honest with her, simply don't lie.  Don't say you're intersted in certain boys when you're not, for example.  I mean, what the chances she's going to suddenly ask if you're a lesbian?  (And if she's asking, that means she already suspects, and its probably best to be honest.)|`|UbvglIS6aa	I know this is hard, but you will lose some friends when they find out you're gay.

AA11984147	Most arrogant people reveal themselves.  The more they talk, the more they tell.  You can spot them by listening to them.  They are often boastful, project a know-it-all attitude, might not allow others to get in on the conversation, may not be honest and forthcoming about information, hesitate or 'hem and haw' about a subject.  They might even walk off.  <br>  <br>  Being manipulative and deceptive starts with having no character or integrity, no love for people, no compassion or loyalty, no responsibility or accountability.  Relationships are null and void or plastic.

That is why.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	because if you're a man who's over 18 and you're hanging out with a 13-15 year old there's a BIG difference of age there and it's not right. Men know about sex more than a 13-16 year old and most of the time men just want sex. Therefore it makes you a pedophile to be hanging out with a girl of such a young age because everyone knows you're just looking for sex and ruining a young girl is forever and is not something you can fix.

Deism does not involve the idea that the deity created anything specifically in the universe.  At most, it believes that deity wound up the universe, then let it run.<br>  <br>  Being that a deity is generally assumed to be omniscient, it can be assumed that the deity would know what was going to happen, but did not directly play a role in it beyond the creation of the universe.|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	I'm atheist, and my personal answer to this would be "because he doesn't exist".<br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, the world was not suited for human life billions of years ago.

The assumption seems to be that all ideas are of equal value and should be tolerated equally, and that a religion should make no demands on its followers.<br>  <br>  The gospel of Jesus Christ contains many promises to those who choose to follow him. There is the promise of a future life in God's coming kingdom. There are also many promises of a rich and full life here on earth. These promises are available to all who want them. Anyone may receive them. It does not matter what your race, nationality, sex or social status is. <br>  <br>  It does not matter what you may have done in the past. <br>  <br>  You do not have to earn them. They cannot be earned. They are a free gift. God wants everyone to have them. In this sense Christianity is non-exclusive, it is open to everyone.<br>  <br>  But, as is the case with many gifts, you can accept them only on the giver's terms. To receive them, you must do certain things. Anyone is capable of doing them. But you must do them to receive the gifts. In this sense Christianity can be said to be exclusive. It is open only to those who are willing to accept its gifts on the giver's terms.<br>  <br>  In human affairs we understand that someone who gives us a gift is entitled to set the terms on which he will give it. If you choose to give $500 to everyone who refrains from smoking for a year, then only those who meet the condition - who do refrain from smoking for a year - will receive the gift. It's your money, and you are entitled to dispose of it as you choose, and on whatever conditions you choose. <br>  <br>  God is not bound by human rules, but if he too chooses to give his promises only on certain conditions, then we should be thankful for the gifts and not complain about the conditions. <br>  <br>  Besides, the conditions are really simple and far more generous than we deserve:  repent your sins, ask for forgiveness and believe and trust that jesus already paid the penalty for your crimes against God and your fellow man.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Not only does he say no to homosexuality, but all sin is equal to him.

Remember the reason why his most beloved creation(humans) die.  We all sin so we all die. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in[a] Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)  Yes people may have different consequences on Earth due to sin, but never forget; we all must face the judgment seat.  God is a just and righteous God and is willing to forgive all sins. He forgives women for abortions and homosexuals for their sins.  Christianity is based on our Lord Jesus Christ and not on man-based traditions.  If He is willing to forgive then so should his followers be willing to forgive.  May God Bless you.|`|5KZZtGnpaa	What do you consider his religion? Christian is not a religion.

Studies on multiple population of animals in-utero.  If multiple fetus in womb of different genders, they got consistent results of male-female behavior after birth.  Like female packed close to males ended up being an alpha female of something.  Then singular form of higher mammals developed either male or female traits based upon parents position on pack or herd.  If low in pack, stress hormones were very high & off spring (male or female) carried the weaker sexes trait.  By weaker sex, I mean that was dependent on whatever animal population was studied. i.e., Hyena's are female dominant packs.  /  So it just makes sense that a lot of that data extrapolates in some form to the human animal.  Note:  It was a documentary about gender identity, not animal behaviors.|`|9xvyjRuBaa	I'm bisexual. At least i think. I have fallen in love with a man and recently in love with woman.

PXMqXwflaa	Life is an adventure. Take it from me; someone 40 years older than you are. I feel the same way I do now that I did when I was 16. But I have a life-time of experiences to look back upon, along with a lovely wife and two daughters to give color and meaning to my daily life.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to live because things will change. If things always stayed the same, we wouldn't appreciate what tomorrow might bring, what were experiencing today, or what happened to us in the past. Sure, you will be sad at times. People you love die. My mother passed a short time ago, and two of my best friends in the last three years. But as long as I hold them in my heart and remember them, they will never be gone. Besides, you need to experience some of the harsh realities of life to fully appreciate the good it has to offer. <br>  <br>  So get out there and enjoy life. Love to be love, and don't be afraid of the consequences. And remember, life is too important to be taken seriously. O'yasumi Nasi Yuki san. (Nihon go Hanashimas desu ka?)|`|3r252UIRaa	You're only 16 (I'm 16 too) you don't need to worry about getting old for a long time. Yes, your current body is impermanent, because all things in Samsara (worldly existence) are impermanent. You can't be happy if you're constantly thinking about the future or dwelling in the past. If you try to live in the present moment, you will be happier. <br>  And as far as death goes, when you die you will be reborn. Reincarnation is a fact. So if you want to come back, you can as many times as you want. As for me, I'd rather attain liberation and attain the everlasting bliss of Nirvana. But if you want to keep coming back to this world lifetime after lifetime you can! But life has alot of suffering. Nirvana is everlasting bliss and freedom from suffering.|`|17XCcoopaa	Umm feel that u r so mature.I am not going to laugh at u ,don't worry.However, I think u shouldn't worry about it bc it is a nature.<br>  The important think is to use your life the best as u can.!!!!!!!

Those kind of thoughts come to me when I am very bored and couldn't think of anything. Believe me, I feel the same as you do. No need to worry about that though, because my mom said to only worry about something that is going on right now or today. That advice helps me a big much. Ask your mom too, moms can also have a lot of ideas when it comes to adult thinking. Don't feel like 80, or dead, because you are not. Be happy that you are living, just don't worry. Good luck on your life!

XN0cYCATaa	Do the badger and rabbit chew cud?  Leviticus 11:5-6    (Lev. 11:5-6) - "Likewise, the rock badger, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you; 6 the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you."          The problem here is that cud is food that is regurgitated from the stomach into the mouth so that it can be chewed again and neither the rock badger or the rabbit regurgitate their food into their stomachs to chew.       The solution is that these animals were categorized with other animals who appeared to chew cud because they move their jaws in the same manner as the other animals listed.     Lev. 11:3 Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat.   Lev. 11:4 Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud, or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you.   Lev. 11:5 Likewise, the rock badger, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;   Lev. 11:6 the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;    Lev. 11:7 and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud, it is unclean to you.               It is known that rabbits practice what is called "refection," in which indigestible vegetable matter towards certain bacteria and is passed as droppings and then eaten again.  This process enables the rabbit to better digest it.  This process is very similar to rumination, and it gives the impression of chewing the cud.  So, the Hebrew phrase "chewing the cud" should not be taken in the modern technical sense, but in the ancient sense of a chewing motion that includes both rumination and refection in the modern sense.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Eh, what's up Doc?|`|9PoGLVmXaa	Sounds to me like the scientists have changed the definition of cud.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Rabbits do not chew cud, they chew pellets.  Maybe it's a minor distinction.  They don't have a 'rumen', like a cow.  They are not ruminants.  Their food is compressed into pellets that come out the other end, and they eat them again.  (Kinda gross, but hey, it's nature!)    They also don't have a cloven hoof, so that's two strikes.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	This is from a Jewish site:    ------------------------    Dear Rabbi,    How can the Torah say that the rabbit chews its cud (Leviticus 11:5-6) when science knows that it does not?     Dear Steven Stone,    The Torah says that we should not eat "the arnevet, for it chews its cud but its hoof is not split." Most commentaries translate arnevet not as rabbit but as either coney, rock badger or hyrax, all of which do in fact chew their cud. Some point out that the rabbit is auto-coprophagous, which can be seen as a form of cud-chewing, where the cud "ferments" externally.

In the Mosaic law the animals people could eat had to both "chew their cud and have a split hoof"|`|macZI2dzaa	The translators of the Bible guessed as to what species the Hebrew word referred.  Obviously, the word does not refer to a hare.  Or, the reference to chewing the cud could be other than the technical modern view of chewing the cud, because rabbits do chew and rechew their food.    The Bible is accurate, but it makes not claims to use 21st century terms in describing situations.  Sorry, you have failed to discredit the Bible, you only do yourself disservice.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	first of all the bible is NOT God  and most people have never owned a rabbit   but where in science does it say rabbits dont chew their cud, need a source|`|AA12071655	Cud is a portion of food that returns from a ruminant's stomach in the mouth to be chewed for the second time. Rabbits and hares are rodents with a single stomach; they do not regurgitate their food to chew it a second time thus are not ruminants.    They may look like they're chewing cud, but they aren't. They do chew their food a great deal as their stomach is fairly rudimentary and so doesn't deal well with chunks.    There are a lot of things in the bible that are just flat-out wrong.

They eat their own poop for the same reason cows chew cud -- because grass is hard to digest, so they digest it twice.  And do you really want to eat an animal that eats its own poop?    I agree with the principle of what you are saying, I just couldn't resist the opportunity to tell a poop story.

Y7ZSaTOtaa	Excellent question, and I wonder the same myself. I am not sure.  I guess the fact that blonde hair is so rare or the combo of blonde hair and blue eyes NATURALLY is very rare idk...the skinny thing is all about some Hollywood bs. Its very pathetic and sad. They want to mimic the models on the runway.  The thinner the model, less fabric is used and because of that hanger ideal, its just chic to some ppl.  I think beauty comes in all colors, sizes and shapes its no one skin tone no one eye color or shade nor texture of hair. Its a little bit of everything.  I think the most beautiful people I have honestly seen had brown hair eyes and skin. But again that is me!|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I guess that all depends on how you look at it.  Sure, there are many beautiful blonde bombshells out there, but there are so many other beautiful women out there as well.  Look at Beyonce, Rihanna, Halle Berry, Ciara, Ashanti, Kelly Rowland, Thandie Newton = all extremely beautiful african american people.  Kyoko Fukada (Japan), Jeon Ji Hyun (Korea), Vivian Hsu (Taiwan), Son Dam Bi (Korea) , Kelly Lin (Taiwan/Hong Kong) are all extremely beautiful Asian women.     I think that almost everyone would agree that these people are very beautiful women, none of which are blonde or blue-eyed.|`|ImiMtrcqaa	I prefer green eyes.|`|Px5PLHAQaa	You are right about the fact that it shouldn't be about black vs white because it is not. However, Not many people buy into the flat back, big boobs, blonde hair, and blue eyes anymore. As a matter of fact most people looking to beautify are trying to tan and get bootie and lip enhancements. So its more like the golden skinned, dark haired, green eyed girl with the bodacious booty, thick hips, small waist, full lips, and delectable breasteses that's waz hapn now (like me) LOL.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	oh please. nobody thinks that unless they are white supremacists and/or retarded!!!|`|tEzWEmA2aa	Because whites want to brainwash everyone into thinking that they are number one. They've done a good job of it as well.|`|R2sgWuqUaa	Like Training day, I think society is a just vague expression and not something that you must take into account when you decide what haircut to have or whatever, otherwise everyone would be the same!  A free society is a place where it is safe to be different.|`|LYPWNxx5aa	I have always preferred brunettes with dark eyes and with curves. The bone is for the dog, the meat is for the man.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Well the majority of us here live in America or Britain and we are still feeling the echo's of English society from way back; I'm talking century's old ideas of what men wanted in women.    (Like China) men wanted women who were pale because it connoted they were wealthy. For example a person would be pale because they did not work outside much meaning they rich; thus making them more attractive.    Blonde hair was considered beautiful too because it was relatively rare (in the days before hair dye lol) and like anything, people love a rarity.    Since our society was built on these racial lines, it is not surprising to see we can still feel the old ideas through our media. However I think nowdays as the world becomes more multicultural people are beginning to see other forms of beauty. Blonde is beautiful but so is brunette, redhead etc!|`|3QNwf2eMaa	ask hitler|`|OtLqGZK8aa	I  wouldn't say that's true because I know a lot of people who find that boring, sure they CAN be very beautiful but personally I like dark hair, green eyes or a black woman with hazel eyes and black hair. That's what I see when I think of beautiful not dark orange skin (fake tan), big fake boobs, platinum blonde hair, and boring blue eyes.    lol @ Guru Sexbomb: You aren't attractive...why would you think anyone would be jealous of you. You look like a dirty amish girl playing dress up with some clothes you found in you're grandmother's basement.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	LMAO at dumb blonde sex bomb guru!!! lol. You think someone wants to look like that???     now, back to asker: it is perpuated by those who look like them and own the airways. that is the only reason why. It's like any other fad that comes in and dies out. Now, people are liking fuller lips, hips, butts, dark hair, and darker more mysterious exotic features. that standard is slowly, but surely, disappearing.    add: ladies and gents, the above link given by the oh, so homely lookin' sexbomb guru- is what some want to make others believe is beauty. lol.    I agree with Julia Z! lol. see how quick she took the pic down. dont blame her. ick.|`|PvPPivLJaa	That's not really true anymore.|`|FMwckpMbaa	Emm, i've heard it's more of the tanned, big boobed brunettes myself but whatever eh.    Media changes its mind all the time, but if you concentrate more on what actual people think then you'll see how varied opinions are.    I don't like muscley guys, with sharp blue eyes and a clean image.   I like brown eyed guys with shaggy hair and just an average body- however, that's not what society would assume.    Plus, there is nothing wrong with skinny, white, blue eyed, blond haired girls either. If they're pretty then they are.    Edit: And all this 'whites brainwashing' crap, is non sense. We have to get the blame for everything don't we?  I'm white, but i have dark hair, green eyes and i'm curvy.  Don't really fit into the 'accepted' image either.  Most white people are brunettes, and the most common eye colour is brown so.... white people have the same negative affects of the media.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	what society ? you better switch off the tv. your brain is getting fried|`|iad9mqaXaa	guru sexbomb looks like a "truckstop pro."    Because some people never think for themselves. Good thing they have their media influences. I think after a certain age, some of them should become disposable.  Because wrinkled skin and age spots are nasty and ugly.|`|t1VthewCaa	I don't know because I think everyone is beautiful in the eyes that matters...which is God by the way!|`|j5uO9LL7aa	Society hasn't had that mentality in a looonnnggg time.

Both he and I thought she was being ridiculous and then she complained about him to me and asks me ... "I'm right, aren't I?  Isn't he being ridiculous?" which of course I disagreed so I kind of just sat there, knowing if I disagreed with her I'd be in the doghouse... it blows my mind sometimes.|`|AA11328507	We do not have to be right...we just are!|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	Nahh, that's just spoiled brats who are afraid to admit they're wrong.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Here are the words to a song that explain women to a "T".

9RvOhmY1aa	I was an angel all the time.|`|AA10614226	I was a demon disguised as an angel.|`|64d77l4qaa	Brat.    -I threw a rock through a stained glass church window.  -When my mom broke her leg I stole her crutches and hid them under my bed so she couldn't catch me as I misbehaved around the house.  -I socked my sister on more than one occasion.  -I shot my sister in the eye with a rubber pellet (toy, not real gun).  -When I was younger I was short, and I was in fights consistently throughout my school years by taking on anyone who thought they could push me around.  -Me and my friends cut down the rival high school sign senior year.    etc etc    I wasn't a good kid. Worse than a brat. My grandpa and 2 uncles were exactly the same, so I blame their influence... hehe.    Luckily I have settled down as an adult.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	If one were to ask me=Angel  Ask my sisters=Brat    So I guess I got the best of both worlds.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I could be both ways and usually was.  I was also quite could at the 'who me?'  look.  I still feel bad for my poor folks, who raised 5 of us hellions.|`|VQNHDTeQaa	I was in three stages I think.  Very young I was an angel, I've been told.Then in later I was an brat ( at times disguised as an angel ) and then full blown BRAT.  Oh yea I sure was for several years.  I think my poor parents were ready to run away from home.  lol|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I was the average boy. I got the other kids in the neighborhood to do bad things. We would make forts and play doctor. I would get them to help steal neighbor's garden produce or fruit from the orchards. We would start vacant fields on fire. One woman accused me of doing naughty things to her girls. I told her that I didn't do anymore than what the girls let me. I was banned from their house and property for a long, long time. (I really didn't do anything to her girls, the woman just didn't like me.)    Yep, I was the average boy: A brat.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	A little angel with big attitude.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Always an angel. I am a giver not a taker and have been all my life. I will go way out of my way to help someone if they need help and never expect anything in return. I have many friends, few if any enemies and I care about people, all people regardless of race or religion. So far I have had a very rewarding life.|`|acaJSqW6aa	At home as a kid I was a silent angel.  Never spoke much at home or away from home.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	I was both but probably more brat.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	If there was such a thing as speed dial back then, the nuns would have had my parents on it.

Got on my big brothers, never got told on for miss behaiving at home cause I knew more on my brothers, all older.

That means I was smart enough not to get caught. Oh, that stopped working when I got married !|`|SsfnitjXaa	Angel|`|dXrHoLMCaa	I LOOKED like a little angel, and used that to my best advantage while I was actually being a little turd.... er.. brat....

LOL!!)  only child, adopted and blessed....|`|8G42oyydaa	At home started out as an angel, it didnt work, so the brat took over to survive.      I think I was always. as a kid, an angel outside the home, kind, considerate, polite to the neighbours, helping the elderly ones, visiting them etc. Concerned that they might be lonely. A good student, well behaved, never got into trouble, didnt drink etc     But I wouldnt back down from anyone, stood up for myself and others.     I wouldnt call it a "brat" but the "wild child" who loved to do dangerous things, if I didnt almost die doing it, it wasnt fun.       Three words I could NEVER resist were "I dare you". I still cant.   Does that mean brat?|`|GrKiEDb1aa	I wasn't either.  I was somewhere in between.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I certainly was no angel and I was not brave enough to be a brat. I guess, all boy, would be the best description of my childhood. My Dad was lord and master and only an idiot would have crossed him intentionally. I did cross him every once in awhile but it was purely by accident or dumb luck. He allowed me to be less than an angel while he dared me to try and be a brat.|`|C2sZREuAaa	angel    I always cared about people when they never asked me too.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	A brat. My sister was the "little" angel. I would tell her scary stories at night to make her cry. While she was sleeping I would push her off the bed and tell mother it was an accident. I would put a lot of salt in her oatmeal when she was not looking and she would tell mother the oatmeal tasted awful and mother made her eat it anyway.(mother did not know about the 'added' salt)  Sometimes I would hide her favorite doll and she would look everywhere for it. What a little angel she was, always so good, so sweet, the darling of the family. She was the informer of the family. Everything I did, no matter how small and insignificant, she would tell and make it a major story. One time I locked her in the closet for telling and got in big trouble, but it was worth it.   Poppy|`|nwnILcEAaa	I was good, but just wanted to be left alone and not bothered.

b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	It's so they know what job to give you as, for example if you're English you work on the west side of London, if you from Holland you would work on the east side of London, it's there to separate races from working together and to keep the level of how mixed the worker are in a workplace; for example they might be a building site offering this:<br>  <br>  Building Construction Site Need a 100 Workers<br>  <br>  Needed amount of races<br>  <br>  55 from European countries. (Cheap)<br>  5 from actual country. (in this case England) (Expensive)<br>  25 from Asia. (Cheap)<br>  15 from Anywhere else. (Variates, no accurate estimation)<br>  <br>  Although the example I just showed you is what a job firm like Connections sees and not the public.|`|TfXKL4X1aa	Forget what everyone else says. It really is for satistics. To learn more about britain so it can better cater for them. Huge surveys happen al the time as companies, governments, organizations need satistics for the most random things. Thats why on certain forms you may get asked a question that has nothing to do with anything. In terms of uni applications, I know I would like to know what percentage of black people are going to uni and whether the number is greater than previous years. Someone dosent sit there personally and mentally document that a person is black or asain. It is simple entered into a computer. I'm not sayin that britain isnt rasict. It definetly is. But i''m sure theyve figured out much better ways of being racist then making you tick a box on a form lol. Seriously|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	I ask that question all the time myself.

FyLfEPv0aa	Valiance is standing in that jail cell knowing that he was about to be killed for his religion and not backing down.    He was mobbed, beaten, and said often that he knew that he wouldn't live to the age of 40.  Leaving for Carthage jail he said "I am like a lamb going to the slaughter" while declaring his innocence.    He was summoned to court over 200 times, but never charged.  Some feel that the fact that he was summoned to court proves guilt; yet Smith's hero, Jesus Christ was likewise summoned on trumped-up charges and executed.    People can say what they want about him, but it's stupid to claim anything other than valiance in his life.    If he were a con-man, wouldn't he have just left with money and been gone rather than dying a martyrs death?    The Good Shepherd gave His life for His flock, and some of His prophets have done likewise.    Nobody in it for sex or money or fame would submit to die and loose all; his submission in murder was to gain all, not loose all.  He sealed his testimony with his blood.  He obviuosly beleived in what he said!|`|wuPTBIIuaa	yes,  in my opinion by degrees though    he was good at some things and failed at others. so not so perfectly valiant in giving away the translation of the large plates. but he was faithful in repentance and obtained a Sure word of prophecy|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	I don't see much difference between Paul, Joseph Smith, or L Ron Hubbard.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Well, "valient" isn't actually a word, but beyond that I really don't think that someone who lies in order to place himself at the head of a made-up religion can be considered "valiant".|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Actually I heard that he was a well known con artist before he created the Mormon church.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	J Smith was a con man and a dabbler in the occult... he, along with others, started the mormon cult... he was nothing special otherwise.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Sorry, you LDS people, Joseph Smith was a rogue.  It's well documented, not a matter of opinion and it's a shame you've been brought up to distrust reliable sources.  If today's Mormons met Joseph Smith they'd sling him out of their churches and rightly so.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	I think JS and Paul both had valiant moments in their lives.  But they were human - the condition in humans is fleeting at best.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	John Taylor, who was in the Carthage Jail with Joseph Smith and witnessed him being murdered by a mob, later wrote that the generations of men will either look at Joseph Smith as a prophet of God, or look at him in negative terms, that his name will be "held either for good or for bad," as John Taylor said.     But either way you look at it, everyone must admit that Joseph Smith gave his life for what he believed in.  And he believed in the Savior Jesus Christ.    I for one, hold him as a prophet of God, a man that gave his life for the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth, and as someone who loved God and someone that dedicated his life to his beliefs, never wavering in those beliefs.   Joseph Smith once said that if he were someone else, even he "would have a hard time believing what he taught.  But that since he saw what he has seen, he has to belief it and knows that it is truth."|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Joseph was promised that his name would be known for good or ill by the whole world.  Was he valiant "all his life"?  He was valiant as a boy when he had to undergo painful surgery.  He was valiant when he stood up to a bullying minister who wanted him to deny what he say.  He was valiant went he preached after being tarred and feathered.  He was valiant to stand in chains before his jailers and demand they cease their blasphemy.  He was valiant to go to Carthage and be martyred.   He was not valiant at times, because he didn't always trust.  He didn't trust Emma enough to openly live plural marriage.  He caved into Martin Harris and gave him custody of his manuscript against to counsel of the Lord.  He caused a critical paper to be silenced, not trusting in the strength of the Saints.  He was of a mind to flee Illinois to avoid arrest, because he didn't trust the Governor.|`|cO8b7Pniaa	Joseph smith is a liar who started the religion of mormonism.|`|vlt8KoXRaa	joseph smith was a con man and a crook don't let him take advantage of you!|`|8uJVN1n3aa	There are tons of different opinions and accounts of Joseph Smith. Anyone who says that they know for certain, either way, is just pretending that their opinion is fact. There is allot of proof that he was a good man, and allot that he did bad things.|`|8IHfytEvaa	If you meant "valiant" then the answer was yes.    Joseph Smith was only in jail a few hours to a couple of days at most before he was hung.    Paul was bold and courageous and correct, since Paul was following the One True God.    Smith was bold and courageous and wrong, since Smith was not following the One True God.|`|cLcQKGu3aa	I need to catch my breath and keep within community guidelines.  I am usually an open minded person and I don't blast beliefs that differ from my own.    I have little respect for someone instituting a community for the purpose of securing many sex partners and then creating a whole religion to hide the motives behind.    I hope I haven't offended anyone.  I speak honestly.|`|s37fnYJ4aa	Who am I to judge and compare these two great men?  Yet, given that I have read the claims of people who like to defame and prayed earnestly about it, I know for myself through the Spirit of God that Joseph Smith was not a fallen prophet.  He died true to God, having sacrificed his whole life to bring forth "a marvelous work and a wonder."    Perhaps this is a good example for us.  Rather than searching for ways to defame people, always look for people's srengths and their acheivements (including your own), give acts of service and try to create union/love between all people.  We are all children of God.  He loves us all and sent His Son to be our Saviour and Redeemer.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	was it joe smith or john doe|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	There is no evidence that Smith ever abandoned his Christian faith, and he was brutally murdered and then mutilated for defending it and the Mormon people.  The hands that killed him were supposedly Christians including several Christian ministers who were not valiant.    Salacious abstracts from books full of errors published by Smith's enemies are not evidence to decent people searching for truth.      There is misunderstanding, decontextualisation,  gross exaggeration, and even deliberate lies in many of the books written to show Smith as being what some responders to this question accuse him of being.  Yet they offer no proof, no evidence.    It is to be remembered that it was the 'religious' people that accused Jesus of being "a glutton, a winebibber, a blasphemer, a usurper of the title and authority of God, of consorting with sinners, and of sedition."    Being accused of something is not the same as being guilty of anything.  Paul was accused and imprisoned, Jesus was accused and imprisoned, and Smith was accused and imprisoned.    All three were put to death by their enemies, who were also the enemies of truth, and, therefore, enemies of Almighty God.    Paul the tentmaker and apostle, and Joe Smith the Prophet were valiant to their divine commissions even unto their deaths.      QUILL    Addendum:    Smith was taken to court forty-three times on various false charges, but was acquitted each time, there being no evidence against him, except the mendacious words testimonies of knaves and devils.    Because something is written in a book sold in a Christian Book Store does not transmogrify the writer's lies into Gospel Truth.    It was my hero, Saint Paul, that said,    "Test everything,   throw away the trash,   and hold tight to everything   that is good and true"|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Yes, he died a martyr.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no and dont fall for that....THE ONLY REAL REVELATION IS IN THE BIBLE.

What a dick.|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	Hey you just described whats on TV this week!     Why shouldnt they read it since they have already been so desentized by these things that the accounts in the bible that are factual and not over explicit are there for a reason not just for 'entertainment' value. They are there so we learn from them.    Not like you are making it out to be ,nastyness just for the sake of nastyness like many things that people watch today.    I have read the bible and guess what? There is also lovely promises from the only True God Jehovah ,such as this messed up system where these horrible things occur, will end and soon and will be replaced with a new system ruled by Jesus and Jehovah.    I invite you to look at this article with bible scriptures to point you to the good stuff     You can beilve in paradise on earth  http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031115/art...|`|FhHklqkhaa	many cherry-pick to suit themselves  many don't see why rape is bad|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	So true.  A book on spirituality should be focused on the aspiring, the beautiful, the positive.  It should be encouraging, reassuring and peaceful.  I have such books in my collection.  The Bible I ditched many years ago.  I couldn't handle the bad energy in my home any longer.      What also bugs me is the way people try to emphasise 'but humans are evil, humans do ugly things'.  True, but is it any wonder when this so called guidebook for life reinforces into these peoples minds on a daily basis.  Messages of peace and love would change a lot more people for the better then messages of violence.  For what you think is what you become.  The mind is the matrix.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	George Bernard Shaw said it better than I ever could: "No one believes the Bible means what it says; everyone believes it means what he says."

They have other people "interpret" the bible to them.  And these priests who "interpret" are obviously not so great either if they go after little boys the way they do.|`|WD6XuJOiaa	I know, I read a story in the bible about two daughters that seduced their dying father to pass on his family name.  People pick and choose what they want to promote in theyre religions and try to ignore the rest.|`|hLiwqo5Laa	nowhere in the bible does it condone those actions, but rather outlines them to provide a basis for the human condition, that being that we as a people are imperfect and cruel by nature. i read my bible thank you very much, but apparently you haven't otherwise you'd have seen the full story, you can't just pick and choose a part of the bible to prove a point, you need to see the entire picture before making a choice of that sort.|`|AA11551690	Well, you're right.  There are some awful things in the Bible.  It is in the Old Testament you will find these things.  This was during a time of great trial and God was very disappointed in man.  This is why He became flesh and brought to us a Savior and gave us a choice...so that we could change the way things were.      No Christian is "ok" with rape, murder, etc.  It is simply that Christians believe that what is told to us in the Bible is fact and we have been given hope to overcome these things.  God does not promise that there will be no sorrow or suffering.  In fact, He tells us just the opposite but He does promise to be with us in all we experience.      Noone should be brow-beating anyone.  That is not what God tells us to do. He does not tell us to try and force anyone or scare anyone into believing in Him.      Don't worry about those who are brow-beating or judgemental.  Focus on those who offer guidance and love with sincere hearts.  There are plenty of Christians who will do that.  Not all Christians are brow-beaters.|`|UWsyqLrwaa	You are the height of ignorance and stupidity!!!  the things you listed is what Humans are capable of...We are not okay with all this because we are against most of it..And how human sacrifice is an ugly thing??|`|CCN2PneTaa	You haveto take into account that just because you're a Christian, it doesn't mean you believe in the faith. Tons of people get baptised every year but do not follow the religion. And I think this is disrespectful, because if you were a true Christian, then obviously, you would have read the Bible, or at least some of it. You say there is some awfully ugly in there, but there is an awful lot of ugly stuff everywhere you look. That's the point. By being a Christian, the idea is you are meant to forgive those who do wrong and be a better person, even though there is badness in the world as you will be rewarded with heaven when you die.|`|qhiEVoRqaa	You are very confused. The bible talks about many religions and how it is to confused people towards the right way, It talks about Jews those are not Christians, pagans and if you read closer the history of catholicism which from there came 850 denominations of religion. The bible is like a warning to pay attention|`|IS7Xubkfaa	It is explained away, glossed over, ignored, denied, omitted, and forgot about.     http://www.skeptic.com/  http://www.randi.org/site/|`|kDzaQC9waa	Morganie4 is absolutely correct.   Let's not discount the 300 prophesies that Jesus fulfilled. Written about the Messiah up to 1200 years before He cam to the earth.     You might have read a few verses to support your argument but it is pretty obvious that you haven't studied the bible to any particular degree. Not saying that that is a bad thing, now you just have your work cut out for you so get to studying. God is not an angry tyrant. The main reason that people do not want to believe in Him is because they do not want to be held accountable for the way that they live their life.    One ironic point of comparison though:  "rape, murder, incest, genocide, human sacrifice, cannibalism, misogyny, slavery, and child mutilation."    ...sounds like the United States huh?|`|349974840c2ddf946cda1b9160ff2645aa	This is all you need to know!!!    Jesus : I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes unto the Father, but by me.    Shema Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself.|`|b44ceed71244692699d1ef1c43cb6193aa	there were a lot of horrible things that happened in the Old Testament like there are alot of horrible things that happen now but there are also a lot of wonderful things that happened in the Bible. How about reading about all the miracles that Jesus preformed while he was on the earth? and there are still miracles that happen today. God doesn't make bad things happen to us, he may allow them to happen, such as with Job, to test our faith and love for Him, but he doesn't make them happen. A lot of times when bad things happen it's because WE have brought that on ourselves with the choices we make... but when bad things happen to "good" people then that is either God testing our faith or Satan trying to turn us from God. I've always heard that if you are a Christian your life is not going to be trouble free, Satan is going to throw everything he has at you to get you to turn from God and turn to him.. and sadly, a lot of times it works.  Because of free will we have a choice. God gave us free will so we could decide things for ourselves, such as believing in Him. I've often wondered if God wishes he'd never given us free will. those of you out there who don't believe in God or Jesus and aren't born again will surely be in for a surprise when the Rapture occures. I hope for your sakes that you come to your senses before it's too late...|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Uh huh....  And God commanded all of that to happen?  The human race were complete puppets and didn't have anything to do with that "ugly stuff"?    First of all....  All that "ugly stuff" is going on now.  Today.  And it's the human race doing it to ourselves.  If you hate all that ugliness, put the blame where it belongs.  Blame us humans.  (That includes you too.)  Humans commit those crimes.  Humans condone those crimes through apathy.        Secondly, your argument seems to be "why worship a god who condones such behavior".  So, you're acknowledging that you accept there IS a God.  Just a bad one.  Is that what point you're trying to make?  Kind of makes you sound like you are the proverbial "Satan" trying to convince humans to rebel.    Thirdly, what exactly do YOU believe?  And how can we as a world stop such things from happening?      If you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the problem.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	Of course there is ugly stuff in there, that is the point...Man does infact do ugly things and God holds us accountable for them...And offers forgiveness to those who will admit them and repent....    If you didn't know it's purpose you really should have asked before assuming anything..THAT is the height of ignorance...    Your comments just go to show how out of touch you are with what the Bible actually teaches...God has every right to deal with His own creation, and if you actually read the Bible you would see that the people destroyed were the result of their OWN actions...God gave everyone the heads up to get in line...|`|NlzlBV8Haa	The bible convinced me to become a Christian.    There is ugly stuff in life and the bible is a practical, realistic book.  It doesn't gloss over or excuse human ugliness.  But God deals with it head on, cluminating in his self-sacrificial death on the cross at the hands of brutal human beings.  That is what life is like on this planet because of sin.    God doesn't condone it, he conquered it on the cross.  -----------------------------------  You talk about rape and murder and incest, but you've only give it a cursory glance - if you dug deeper you'd see that each of these acts brought punishment and suffering upon the families where they occurred...     That's the tragedy is that some people are so biased when they come to the bible that they never dig deep enough to discover the jewels of truth therein.|`|NCRfZRopaa	I also wonder that myself...|`|FpMS47sXaa	If one has done their homework, one would know that the Bible is riddled with inaccuracies.    The Bible is only a map on the road to life - not an instruction manual.      One can still be Christian and not pay too much attention to the writings of men. Being a Christian has nothing to do with the pages of a book.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Not many of them.    The reason I stopped being Christian is just that, I read the Bible.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The more I read the Bible, the more I see how much Jesus loves me, and how much of a Savior He is from all things!  :D
Kz7BsZk6aa	That's like sitting around contemplating what you would do if you won the lottery.  Sure it would be fun but it just isn't going to happen.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Hard to see even a slight off chance unless we all become "god" or something, become part of the all again.  Individuality post-life is impossible to imagine since we figured out a long time ago you need a brain with oxygen rich blood pumped into it for the neurons to do their thing.  But I will answer your question - I would be freaked out that I could never die.  Frankly, I can't do infinity.  I'd be stark raving mad after just a few millennia, if not sooner.|`|pO8OzblHaa	I'd mostly be sad. I mean, I'm eighteen and already think that I've experienced enough of the people on this planet. I definitely don't want to be stuck with them (and even more of them) for forever. That would be way too much.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Probably sad, because I'm sure the Christians will be there harassing them for all eternity saying, "See, we told you so!"|`|ViZH5twNaa	Depends. Living a few extra years after I cash it sounds fun, but living for eternity sounds like Hell in its own right.    First 10 years, 100 years, even the first 1000 years I might get some if not a lot of enjoyment out of; but the next 10,000 years, 100,000 years, 1 trillion years will be utter misery. I would probably be begging for nonexistence. Human level consciousness was never meant to last that long.    *edit*  In this "Quantum-Immortality" would one remember their past lives? If not then it wouldn't really matter if such a phenomena exists because it wouldn't be me who is being reincarnated. If I could remember it all then after the trillionth life I would probably just lay down and wait until the next life. I would have experienced everything prior to that point so what would possibly motivate me to keep going?|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Ah - yet another christian that does not know the definition of atheist!!    ATHEIST -  someone who does not believe in a God  any God  not just the Christian one.  But that does not mean they do not hold strong moral or religious beliefs!  They can follow any religion that does not have a god and there are a lot of those!!    Great ones like BUDDHISM  Religious teaching from Buddha and his followers that by destroying greed, hatred and delusion (the cause of all suffering) man can attain perfect enlightenment!!    They can believe in an afterlife, a soul even supreme beings as long as non of it is connected to a god!!

I dunno, frankly I think one life is enough for me. I'd be interesting to see something else, but I'm not sure I'd be overjoyed about it.    So, neither. I'd probably feel like "Sigh... well, let's hope people don't get hit by cars in this one, 'cause eternity is a long time to spend with a shattered pelvis..."|`|URO3gDXcaa	very sad.  i get bored easily now.  an after life would drive me to tears.|`|WynOhlMZaa	Honestly, bittersweet.    Sad that I was going to have to live foreverandeverandeverandever.    Happy that I wouldn't have to cease to exist yet, and that I would get to see my deceased best friend again.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Happy...I would think.|`|ul1P1qAQaa	I don't know... do I go to heaven or hell?    If this after-life meant a polarized place where we were all ultimately placed according to our worth and obedience to one will, I think that sounds really terrifying... even if I we're judged best of the best and I got to sit right next to god, if I still had the capacity to analyze my circumstances and the conscience I do now, it would weigh on my chest and turn my stomach until it twisted my mind with the question of whether god was truly just a self-serving and subjective tyrant or I had in fact been sent to a cleverly designed hell. So that prospect would be hell for me either way...    Any other concept of an afterlife: a rebirth, a collective consciousness, a purely physical and electrical continuation of matter type after-life, ...or a mental realization during life that evil is nothing more than the turbulence caused by forces that are moving in different directions than my person, outside of which I would not have a positive or negative opinion about, other than maybe the awe of the sum total and sheer complexity of existence... that sounds like heaven to me, and I have no qualms then with any of them...    Eternity doesn't scare me though because after much contemplation of the latter, my concept of time melted with it... I now "suffer" disassociative disorder... in other words the completely objective and unattached depersonalization of all experience, and the unhinged experience of time without my self to experience it by... without which there is no difference between a second and a year... sometimes it is overwhelming and horrifying to think that all understanding of the world by human is so circumstantial... most of the time it feels like a continual relief of all earthly social constructions that make no sense... it IS what I've come to believe was meant by an afterlife, the death of the person... and the heaven and hell of the realization of consciousness without self... I just kept trying to learn everything and then one day I blew a fuse and it felt like the ultimate epiphany at the time... and now "it", "he", "everything"...whatever you want to call it... it just IS.|`|283tO9j9aa	Valhalla would be pretty awesome, if I died and went there I would be happy.    Otherwise, I don't know. I'm not keen on the idea of eternal life, I think I would get bored!    If it was anything like Heaven is described I think I would attempt to get out :P It sounds like it's not much fun.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	I believe in an afterlife but I'm indifferent to it. I believe you should only be focused on this life.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	I think anyone would be happy if we had assured knowledge of an afterlife (unless it was in hell)   It's not impossible that our conciousness might go on after our bodies die, just unlikely.|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	Fncking everything is fake. Why do you believe in anything? Everything is fake.|`|YfbC1m3haa	Pascals Wager    Do you think that your deity will allow you to the afterlife, especially if the sole reason for belief is to believe "just in case"?|`|zWj6HXHNaa	If there is one I would like to become a ghost, like those in the Star Wars movies.|`|wM7pprr1aa	I'd be devastated, I mean, a literal eternity, regardless of whether it's a good one or a bad one, and regardless of what activities are available, will eventually bore me.  I mean, how long until I've seen / heard / done / experienced EVERYTHING that afterlife has to offer?    No matter how varied things are, with in infinite amount of time to experience them, I would eventually go insane from the ennui (boredom).    Now, if the afterlife was finite, that I'd be cool with.|`|e62bd07bcb636d0b96228f498abf49fdaa	whatever is going to happen when we die is already in place, no matter what we believe. If we just decompose there is nothing we can do about it. If there is a god we can be sure that we will stand before him (judgement day) alone. No ones input can help us there. The best we can do is search inward for our own truths, not worry about what someone else believes.  In either case it seems like the golden rule of all major religions "Do unto others" (the empathy concept) would be the way to live your life no matter what the belief system.

I don't at all believe that the lives of the kind of people who think it's acceptible to murder a baby at any stage of development are completely equal to an unborn childs, but rather that the unborn child's life is far more precious and that if anyone deserves to die it is the people who support depriving unborn children of their basic right to life and use the technical loopholes like "it's not technically a person until X stage" in a sorry attempt to defend their stance.    I'm not bombing abortion clinics, for one thing, because it would get me put in jail for life if not the death penalty and for another Jesus died for me when I didn't deserve to live so I am in no position to to kill someone who I don't believe deserves to live.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I don't understand the reasonings behind them..How is killing a doctor who performs an abortion any more righteous?

tdNaZ9qAaa	Thebible talks about people like this at 2 Timothy 3:1-17        1 But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3 having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4 betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. 6 For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, 7 always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.    how sad...    that is good that you helped her. keep doing that|`|qbelhflAaa	Old people are cranky.

If you listen to what has been said about it you can be deceived.<br>  The Book of Revelation talks about the Old Testament concerning where it is in the future of man. It also tells about some of the claims from the New Testament that may go against the Old Teachings. It tells us about the so-called deep Secret of Satan in which we have been deceivingly taught as the very words of God.<br>  It reveals to us who the real Lucifer is that is never claimed nor mentioned as the Dragon, The Ancient Serpent and the Devil named Satan.<br>  If there is anything you do not believe it is only because you never did understand.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i dont beleive what ALL peopls say it says it says. <br>  <br>  no<br>  even the rapture is "supposed" to be biblical. but there is just enough other bible verses to discredit the possibility.<br>  <br>  <br>  for example the mark of the "beast" it has existed since cain was marked by God. yet Right now only a computer chip is defined as the actual mark. although it fits every description|`|WjRqYf6naa	The proper title is The Revelation of Jesus Christ.|`|mSFjbetxaa	No way.<br>  <br>  I believe very little of what is written in the buy-bull.|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	I don't know a book containing REVELATIONS.

AyEkA6Flaa	He is attracted to you.  So the question is, are you -- honestly and truly -- attracted in a passionate way to him?    If you are not deeply attracted and passionate for him -- if you don't *want* him -- then love and support your friend, but keep things as being buddies...don't be boyfriends in that case because it would be a lie.    However, if you are passionate, romantic and loving in your feelings toward him, then you could enter into a boyfriend relationship with him because that would be your honest feeling.    BUT, don't do anything romantic like making out, being naked together, oral, whatever, unless you FIRST agree that you will remain good friends no matter what.    Because being best friends is a special gift, and you want to preserve that at all cost.    So, if you get romantic, but one or the other of you gets kinda weirded out from kissing or being sexy, then just agree that in that case you will be honest, put the brakes on the romance, forgive each other, hug each other -- and go on being excellent friends.    On one hand, if you really are into him deeply and he gives you intense energy, this could be a really cool thing.  But on the other hand, you don't want shallow experimenting to ruin your friendship with jealousy or bitterness.    So, be honest...and if you both want to get romantic, do it.  But, talk each step over ahead of time, and agree to dissolve the romance if it is not working, but to put your friendship first.    Are you both willing to do that?    Good luck!|`|k3TKEOJBaa	Hello Love, you are in a pickle by not being out yet but that should be the least of your worries. If you love him and you know he loves you back then there is nothing at all wrong with being with him. But keep in mind that love is complicated and relationships are hard work by you guys being drunk it sounds a little vulnerable and I would be careful that you dont fall into lust. By having sex with him you would damage your friendship and then things would be difficult because then you would have nothing but memories. If you truely love him start things slow and be careful    -Love Danni|`|4KNESOnlaa	Have sex and worry about the friendship later....you will always find new friends in life......who know's maybe he is your life partner, don't pass it by....................|`|WDbE5gffaa	I'm assuming you like him back?  Well, you're both not out yet, so yes, its going to be hard. I don't know your situation, but i imagine you don't want to come out yet.  Well, why should you? Its your own business. You don't have to tell people you've been with him or what you two are doing.  If you want to be with him well,,,then do it. But make sure understands what you want to do in regards of being out and stuff, before getting to caught up in it.   But, if his friendship means more to you than a possible relationship, then don't do it. But it sounds like he wants to be with you....The question you really need to ask yourself, is, do you want to be with him?|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	1st of all - Danni, I'm sure you are a lovely guy, you just creep me out. Sorry, I had to get that out there.     2ndly. Are you gay? Do you want a relationship with this guy? If so, go for it. Your friendship will most likely never be the same after the kiss anyway.|`|AA11589320	At first you are wonderful at painting your self as the innocent young man who's friend attempted to take advantage of you in a moment of fun.    Yet your closing line gives the game away.     It was you not him who took advantage of the moment.   You knew all along by his behaviour that he is interested,  You then agree to sleep over, drink lots of alcohol and sat next to him,  arms open.       You wrote.  "because we're both not out of the closet"    In that case, go back, have a few more drinks and enjoy the experience.      If one day one of you decide to marry a women (YUCK) you don't need to let a few sexual encounters cause any trouble.  Just keep it between yourself.   Lots of friends have done just this and even now and then revisit their past.

eybHcHz9aa	I sometimes have trouble understanding the Dumfries and Galloway accent, and Northern Irish accents confuse me greatly.  You'll find that accents vary within Ten Miles in the UK, but you can tell a born and bred northerner from a southerner as easy as you can in the USA. The Northerners have Baths, the sought have Baaths!     You have to watch out for colloquial language too, my own County of Cumbria says "Bar" for pounds "Scran" for food and "Chore" for steal.

t7KHxE2Iaa	Wilson is a good example of a patronymic name, meaning "son of Will". Or Ivanovich (son of Ivan), as they'd use in Russia.     A matronymic name would be similar, only using the mother's name. Or, the mother might give her child her maiden name. For example, my sister's middle name is Wolf, which was my mother's maiden name. That's matronymic.|`|XvWotokIaa	Other examples of Patronyms:    Irish: O'Riley Son of Riley  Turkish: Murato?lu: Son of Murat    Also, in Turkey, in official documents you are recorded as X son or daughter of Y and Z, where X is your name, Y is your father, and M is your mother.    e.g. I am Marion, Edward ve Elsie k?z?.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Patronymics are the father's name. Like Katrina Ivanovna Ulyanov. She's Katrina, daughter of Ivan Ulyanov. Or Bj?rk Gutmundsdottir. She's Bj?rk, daughter of Gutmund.  Can't think of a culture that uses matronymics at the moment.  Why? Tradition :D
RIQi2znLaa	im sorry friend you cant. to be a vampire u have to be born a vampire. getting bitten by one doesnt make you one. but they are quite real. at some point in your teenage years usualy between 14-17 you are "awakened" there are 3 kinds. sang who consume blood. psy who feed on the emotional energy of others. and hybrids like myself who are a mix of the two. we are just as human as you like you we to bleed. like you we will die. obviously we are looked down on people say we are not real. they are the fools.  this whole "twilight" nonsence has upset people. we are no more or less attractive as other people. now a days its hard to be a sang. obviously you cant really get your hands on blood now. and i mean you cant really go around bitng people ether! its a complictated thing. but no you cant be "turned"|`|8k6kxOh2aa	if you mean such as psychic vampires.  you can't become one. you must be born one. i have spoken to a couple of psychic vampires, and they all agree, this is the only way to be one. sorry.   ~stardriven09|`|FLOjzbKEaa	you dont need to be.  it seems you already are.|`|mU0608klaa	get bit|`|94PHAJw9aa	Drink the blood of an innocent.

EzrdyxAiaa	speaking what i thought when i was younger say 50 years ago i really did not appreciate or care what others had done before me!!!|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I'm 18 and of course I greatly appreciate what others have done in history including WW2.     I probably wouldn't have been born if Hitler had won the war because I have Jewish descendants and a Jewish surname. If I had been around in the 1930's/1940's I would have been sent to a concentration camp. So of course I appreciate the people who fought against Hitler and the people who fought against other evil people before that.    Because without them I wouldn't be sitting at my laptop typing this.    EDIT: I know lots of people who aren't rich either. If everyone was rich there wouldn't be such a thing as poverty.
avxXptfCaa	Hola Alex,    Si es as, pero tambin hay que prestar  bien el odo pues a veces los Americanos blancos pausan mucho al hablar y puede ser que estn diciendo:    So I... uhh... might...  uhh (pausa )    y continan la oracin.   Los blancos por lo regular dicen el "might have"  que suena como un   " might of ."    Esta frase por otro lado  puede sonar como el might have ( might'a ) de los Afro-Americanos, ya que estos tienden a acortar mas las palabras y a hacerlas mas rpidas y a veces si el odo no esta bien entrenado puede el que oye  confundirse.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Oh yes you can! The Father is described in scripture as the only Saviour. That means he saves (Isaiah 59:1 & 45:21-22 - "There is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Saviour").    Scripture also describes Jesus Christ as the Saviour. That means he saves. (Titus 3:4-6 "God our Saviour appeared, he saved us, through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour").    Consider - all three Persons of the Holy Trinity save us; Father, Son and Holy Spirit.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	Our sins have already separated us from the Father...The Father provides the way back to Him by His son..|`|IqqaA2wIaa	Jesus is also part of God...He decided the word would become Jesus....Thats all we know....ITS THREE IN ONE...|`|9mLjDa5kaa	1 John 2:23  "Whoever denies the Son (Jesus), the same has not the Father: he that acknowledges the Son (Jesus) has the Father also."|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because the Father said whoever honor the Son honors Him too.|`|rcCYssKYaa	Because I was born of the Mother.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	according to Torah and the prophets   both Enoch and Elijah were Taken without tasting death.     but, else where it says that 3 were saved in their generations.   i think those 3 were Enoch, Job and Daniel.   but there was also the 3 who were cast in the Furnace     so God, if NOT jesus, does Save but for the most part NONE were truly saved like these.     in the new testament, however, Christ jesus is given the role of saviour and God the Father gave the throne to HIM. so right now i doubt God the Father is in the saving of souls (for planet earth)|`|jOwH96wKaa	Because he doesn't exist?|`|xyIZv6iiaa	Because His Son, Christ, is the mediator between this world and the Father.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	You can.

nuCXcLUIaa	I guess no one wants to get in on this question, so I'll give it my best shot.  He may be out of your league.  On top of that, the chance that he's gay is about 1 in 10, probably less if he's the "cool kid."  I think the first step would be talking with him in a friendship sort of way, until you get to know more about him.  Find out about his interests, and just approach him one day, best if he's alone.

We see the process happening befor eour eyes; the expanding universe, collapsing stars... it all makes perfect sense.|`|macZI2dzaa	I have actually heard a person with a doctorate in physics claim that the Big Bang may have been preceded by the "Cold Swoosh".    Anything to avoid the proposition that God is real.|`|AA12270622	Creationism doesn't logically explain the matter.  It simply stops in the middle of the road of inquiry, slaps together a wall, and hangs a sign on it that says "God did it here" so it doesn't have to look any further down the road.|`|LqyOHY37aa	Then where did the creator come from? If the creator could just appear, why doesn't he appear in someones house?|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	What caused the big bang?  We don't know.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	theres a problem with your logic.  you have the same paradox in explaining what created the creater of the big bang, as others do simply explaining the bang itself.  where did that creator come from?  you just added an identical layer to the problem.  simply saying he/she/it always existed, well that doesn't really make sense in a logical way does it? after all i could then say that the "stuff that caused the big bang" had just always existed as well.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	Okay, maybe the big bang didn't happen, but then how can anyone deny evolution? Seriously, how could evolution NOT have happened? We have skeletons of creatures that progress from monkey to human. In perfect order of carbon dating and closer to human. The newer the bones, the more they resemble humans|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	So you think the big bang theory is illogical because it involves creationism (according to your misunderstanding) yet you think creationism is more logical than the big bang theory.  And this makes sense to you?  Why do you claim that if the big bang happened then it should happen again in someone's house, when you presumably don't say the same bullshit about creationism?  In any case, just because you don't understand a complex area of science doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.|`|xy4z8bQraa	they dont think it came from nowhere, they think its what created the universe as we know it, maybe god is what guided the universe into what it is today . makes more sence than thinking it was a wizard or something like that.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I don't know.  But either do you.  The difference between you and me is that you feel the need to believe that an invisible man did it just because you don't know the answer.  I just believe that in time we will know and it will be a natural cause, like evolution.  Some theories say that the cycle of expansion and compression happen over and over eternally.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I don't know. Maybe God? Maybe something else? Who knows if this is the first Big Bang or the only Big Bang? Too many unanswered questions to say for sure what and how and how many and who done did it?    I don't think or feel that a creator that started everything has any concern for a human anymore than that creator has anymore concern for a bacteria.|`|AA10698792	Uhmmm...the big bang is supposed to have been caused by a hot primordial initial condition that, in causing the bang, destroyed itself therefore it couldn't occur again.    According to the theory, which you might want to read sometime, because clearly you haven't, the bang was caused by a unique cacophony of heat, radiation, nucleosynthesis, and a bunch of other big words I'm not entirely qualified to throw around.    Now don't get me wrong, I'm neither a Creationist nor an Evolutionist but I can see the rationale behind both principles and I, unlike you, respect people's right to believe what they believe especially since it's no skin off my nose when they do.|`|OMcIR0gYaa	could have been a fart... you can be worshiping a fart! O_o|`|zAih0Vx5aa	Maybe we just don't know.    Maybe we are too simple to understand.    Maybe we will never know.    Just because we don't have the answer it doesn't mean we have to look to a 'higher' being. I don't fully understand how my wireless internet connection works. No-one fully understands how quantum particles behave. Maybe, one day, I'll bother to learn about my internet connection and science will fully explain quantum physics. In the meantime, we don't need to look to a 'God'.    Where do those who hold religious beliefs think God came from?    Asking "where all the stuff that caused the Big Bang" came from is no different to asking "where did God come from". The question simply demonstrates that we have reached the limit of our current knowledge and comprehension.    Maybe one day we will know. Maybe we won't.|`|XwqePXrOaa	I don't know.    There are some sketchy theories involving multiverse fracturing, but these are closer to 'theories' in the conventional sense than 'theories' in the scientific sense.    The nice thing about science is, when you don't know something, you're honest and say "I don't know" instead of "a wizard must've done it!"|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Causality can only be applied within the concept of time. Time is a dimension of the universe, hence, it is nonsensical to talk of causes of the universe.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	The same thing that 'causes' fissionable atoms to pop - nothing but probability.    The world turns out to be deeply non-deterministic. Many processes don't require a 'cause' - they just happen. It seems that Nothing can decay into Something eventually.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	The first thing that comes to my mind is some erotically oriented fun! spiritually speaking, of course...      The Big Bang is not a perfect explanation on how we got here... The time element needs to be taken into consideration, too. The Big Bang is about the most intelligent explanation to this day!  Even God needs the time element to function...!|`|tsgP2JfBaa	Actually there are numerous ways to explain where the "stuff" came from rather than Creationism.  That fact that we haven't yet confirmed which of these explanations (if any) is correct in no way indicates that God is the only logical alternative.    Science knows that it doesn't know everything.  It doesn't just make crap up so it can have an "answer."|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Why are christians always ignorant of simple science taught in schools?!!    Science explains the big bang was not from nothing but from a singularity that was all the matter and energy in the universe compressed into a single point that then expanded rapidly!!    So in answer to your question it was always here!!    The mass grew hotter and more unstable until it expanded rapidly!!    But your stance was explained exquisitely well by Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put  Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth!!     Please realise that like a parachute the human mind only functions correctly when it is open!!|`|JqHkgWROaa	Christians believe in the Big Bang too...    It's when Adam and Eve had sex for the first time.    But atheism is nothing more than lacking belief in any god or gods. It doesnt mean they have any extreme knowledge in the way the universe works. Atheist != scientist.|`|wZEGi1EHaa	atheists would only have an informed opinion on this if they happened to work in cosmology or high energy physics.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Straw man. Nobody says it was created.|`|W0qNkROpaa	Someone's house isn't nowhere, though, is it?  There's no vacuum in someone's house.    Anyway, the big bang doesn't mean a big empty universe full of nothing and then some stuff appeared and exploded.  The entire universe began at the big bang.  All of space, everything.  It was not an explosion, it was the start of the expansion of the universe.    I don't know how or why the big bang happened.  Nobody does.  But people are investigating it.  It's very interesting.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	"To me creationism always seemed more logical then the Big Bang."    i'd love to hear the logic behind creationism.   but to answer your question, the issue of why or the first cause is not a scientific question.    do you think it's either science or religion? that's like saying it has to be peanut butter OR jelly, when we all know they work great together.    well, after creationism gets rid of the salmonella, that is.|`|mSFjbetxaa	If you are truly seeking knowledge there are a few good sites you can read.    http://www.allaboutscience.org/big-bang-...    But, if you are going to prefer to remain ignorant than why even ask the question?|`|AA12203324	The problem with your argument is the words "come from".  You're assuming that there's a "before" to the universe.  Science has shown that time is not some isolated, linear flow of occurrence.  Rather than whistle around any explanation of an irreducibly complex "creator", I prefer to consider the Big Bang as the temporally pointy end of a universe that always exists, the mathematical origin point of our time and space.|`|Tk4cr3UVaa	1. the big bang was caused by the big crunch  2.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Which one of us would have died in order to prevent others from suffering that eternal damnation? God did, in the person of Christ. He gave up his life, in an horrific episode of suffering and ignominity, to open the door to eternal bliss. All we have to do is accept, in faith, that his love was that great.

John 10  26 but you do not believe because you are not my(Jesus) sheep.    John 8:44  You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.    Romans 9  19One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us?  For who resists his will?"  But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "  Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,  'Why did you make me like this?' "Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?

Dante took the pagan notion of eternal torment and painted a lasting impression on the minds of church-goers that still infects most believers today - one that if we look into it, we would not be able to fine scripture to agree.    Perish does not mean "live forever in misery" ... and I know there are lots of reference to eternal punishment and eternal fire, but just because the punishment is eternal and the fire is eternal, doesn't mean that those subjected to the fire are likewise eternal.  Rather, the eternal fire destroys those subjected to it.     The word Gehenna referred to the NAME of the city dump, where a fire was kept burning by the trash thrown within.  Everyday the people would bring out their trash and throw it in Gehanna where a fire burned from before the time anyone could remember starting it.  However, the trash was new each day.  This is the biblical picture of the damnation.  It is permanent, and eternal ... but that which is thrown is has no eternality .. and neither could the damned have eternal life for they have rejected it.    Will there be gnashing of teeth?  Yeah, spoiled brats who thought the gift of life had no expiration will whine and complain on the way to the fire, like children being dragged out of ChuckECheese's ... it's over too soon ... the damned are selfish and give no thought to be grateful for the time they were given so they weep when it has come to an end.

He wants us to have loving and nurturing relationships with one another.    He gave us life and wants us to live it in happiness and in loving and helping one another.  He gave us a choice.  He did not want us to come to Him because we had no choice and were made to do so, He wants us to come to Him of our own free will.      There are always circumstances to our decisions.  Our human parents teach us that and that is the way it is with God...just like a Father should be with His children.|`|WD6XuJOiaa	I feel like God gave us life as a gift.  To do with it as we choose.

"Souls" DIE! (Ezekiel 18:4) The reward for sin is eternal death, NOT eternal life in an ever-burning hell-fire. (Romans 6:23)    HELL:  Hebrew - she'-ole = grave  Greek - hades = grave  Greek - Gehenna = the valley of Hinnom  Anciently, this was the trash dump outside Jerusalem. There was nothing manufactured that was a pollutant. All trash was burned there. The population was large enough that the fire never got a chance to extinguish before more trash was dumped. Those that are determined to be wicked as their own decision will be burnt TO DEATH there, never to exist again.  There are resurrectionS. Those that have never known the truth are going to be resurrected and taught the truth and given ONE chance.     Rev 20:5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the FIRST resurrection.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Werewolves do not exist. The body cannot withstand that kind of change - you would die from cardiac arrest induced by massive system trauma long before you could resemble a wolf. It would require massive loss and growth of bone structure, reshaping of the skeleton, a complete rearranging of all major organs located in the torso as well as the nervous and circulatory systems. The skin itself would have to thicken and all your hair follicles would have to repattern themselves to grow fur. Lastly, the brain would change, and when you lose brain tissue you lose the memories and functions associated with it, such as in a stroke. If a person could change into a wolf, and then back, they would return to human form with the mental capacity of a wolf, and be a drooling idiot at best and a homicidal maniac at worst.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	I am not sure, but I always keep a gun loaded with pure silver bullets just in case.|`|n53HeORBaa	yes they are, and they are being controlled by a secret satanic group  the transformations are bought about by demonic control that makes them possible to transform without dying although this can be very extremely painful, this is used by the satanic sect to punish their members for not following their laws|`|XxZQ72J4aa	No. I have an explication as to where they came from, though. I learned it in LA class, believe it or not. :P<br>  <br>  This might sound crazy and awkward, but the idea of the werewolf actually came from women with PMS! Once a month, often around the full moon (ring a bell?) women would get so moody and angry, making them seem feral, that they were often asked to leave. The woman might go out into a house in the forest until she was done menstruating.|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	Who's asking about me? *looks around*<br>  Oh, you?<br>  Nope, we're not real.

Yes werewolves are real, and there are two types of werewolves. There is a m-shift werewolf and a p-shift werewolf. A M-shift werewolf does not physically turn into a wolf, only they think they are a werewolf deeply so at some points they go savage. Now, a P-shift werewolf includes alpha werewolves and beta werewolves. Alpha werewolves are the ones that can control themselves and change when ever they want. Then, beta werewolves are the ones that are uncontrollable. They have to change every full moon and they attack anything that breaths basically. The only way to become an alpha werewolf is to be born and beta werewolves come from being bitten by an alpha werewolf. If you are an alpha werewolf then you would start to notice it around 14 or 15 years of age, as this is when you are mature enough to change. The first few times you change will only be on a full moon and you will not notice it, but about 4 or 5 months later you will. Every night you will get Extreme pains as your body starts to change, and it's not like the movies how it happens fast. No, the change happens very slow at first, but over time it goes faster. Now, beta werewolves come from being bit by an alpha werewolf, saying you live. If you were a beta werewolf it would probably take you a while to notice. As you don't feel the change because you black out, and you always wake up normaly as there are no side effects. Like you don't get cravings for anything you don't feel hyper, nothing. As an alpha werewolf your wolf characteristics effect your human daily life.|`|AA10236380	We often use the expression "There's no such thing as a stupid question."<br>  <br>  We also often use the expression "For every rule, there's an exception."<br>  <br>  Congratulations, you are the exception to the rule.<br>  <br>  There are no werewolves, zombies, vampires, aliens or compassionate conservatives.|`|4FR9d17Xaa	not, hints why they are mythological creatures.

Okay?<br>  Is that considered coming out of the closet?<br>  No, seriously: you should know all about them, it's fascinating. Werewolves transform every night except the new moon, becoming more wolfish as the full moon draws nearer. But there are medicines that can be taken every night (except the full moon when the transformation is complete) that stop the transformation entirely. We lovingly call them "werewolf pills". That's why they only come out on the full moon, because they can't take the pills.<br>  Werewolves are formed by either or both parents being one or from being bitten - however, it can also be spread in the same way HIV/AIDS can be - contact with bodily fluids. Intercourse can spread it, though the risk of that is very slight. I got turned into a half-werewolf by open-mouth kissing a half-werewolf (the first recorded case of that, I believe).<br>  Half-werewolves are formed by being bitten by a half-werewolf or having your mother become a werewolf while pregnant and then give birth to you before the next full moon. Half-werewolves can take the pills every day because the transformation is never complete. So they can't be tracked as easily, and they are around. Here's how to distinguish them among the crowd:<br>  1. Twelve hours after taking the pills, the pills wear off, and the person can experience short bursts of anger or splitting headaches. If this occurs frequently around the same time in a person, they could be one.<br>  2. They tend to have more energy around noon to six in the afternoon as it gets closer to the full moon. This energy is never spent out and comes regardless of what they ate or didn't eat that day. If this energy gets stronger as the full moon approaches and weaker as the new moon approaches, the person could be a werewolf.<br>  3. They tend to look more tired towards the full moon. They need less and less sleep as the full moon approaches, and they can get more things done with that less time for sleep. So they will look tired as the full moon approaches and well-rested when the new one arrives.<br>  Thanks for your time.|`|H2iX8Ht7aa	They might but they might not. some people say yes because they said humans came from animals orignally and some people might have not transformed all the way.

In America a person can adopt, marry, and join the forces but not drink. I think it is dumb and leads to more binge drinking becuase people are so wanting to drink.

rThIVk2maa	Breaking down of communication and ultimately of understanding between groups with different interests and customs.
hHjPFxEdaa	They do seem to have a thing about skinny women. I think maybe they are more worried about what other people think and about trying to impress. Don't get me wrong, there are guys like that in all races (especially Asians) but more White guys do seem to be concerned about fitting into some mold of what is acceptable to society and about seeing women as status symbols.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I think as much as you say white men have brainwashed by all this, isn't it possible that white women have been brainwashed to think that white men feel that way?  I live in Texas and white girls are certainly not anorexic here and they have absolutely no problem getting and keeping a man.|`|grBxTsK6aa	Just the gay ones.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	Not all white men....my bf is white and i dont think he is particularly picky...everyone can be picky at times with who they wanna date....just really depends on the individual, an i think black boys are the pickiest|`|Shp5riE6aa	I like a woman with a little chub.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	That's very, very true.  Maybe men of color learn to appreciate the finer things a woman has to offer, rather than the package itself.  Makes you wonder.  And maybe they should teach their white buddy's a thing or two?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I think it's just you, I haven't noticed that.    My cousin is white and his girlfriend is probably 3 times his weight...|`|vk1TcfTeaa	I totally agree! It's way harder to please white guys! Black and latino men seem to accept more varieties in the ladies. Although black men tend to like girls with big booties! Latin men take anything...arrrriba!    ps- my friend who is japanese said that japanese men are hard to please. She said she gained like 10 pounds in the US when she lived with me and the boys kept telling her she was fat! (she's was about a size 5!)|`|Uh2vfl5Uaa	I kind of see where you are coming from, but I don't think it's a matter of brainwashing. There are a ton of hot, thin, and famous woman of other colors to set that sort of precedent: I.E. Eva Longoria, Rhianna, Selma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, etc. So, if it was brainwashing that caused this (and I don't really think that your thought is a hundred percent accurate) wouldn't everyone, in every race, be in the sam boat?|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	They can be but if you polled white men regarding who was hotter between Paris Hilton and Beyonce, I think Beyonce would win because of her stunning...personality???

I have some real close buddies that are mex and black and they straight up tell me they like a fat ***. I have a white niece married to a black and he tells me its "cause of da backside" I almost killed the F*****R!!!!I myself do not I like it to jiggle 2 or 3 times when you slap it not create a tsunami. I also think there is a direct link with the self ersteem of these people too.|`|3QNwf2eMaa	White men are pickier.

They think a UK Size 10 is fat, my husband is a pakistani, and although he's not that bad, he is quite picky.|`|AA11660242	I think it just depends on the person as an individual rather than what ethnic group he belongs to. I'm Hispanic, but I'm not ecessarily more accepting to plus size women than white men are. I like my women in three sizes; thin, normal, and big. They have to have certain proportions though.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	it is a matter of taste men may like fatty women and other like the skinny but at the end the both size of women do the job !!|`|PvPPivLJaa	The men who are sticklers regarding size and appearance are usually those men who have what it takes to be able to choose (meaning looks, money, status). You get your average joe in any race, and seriously, they don't care so much. I live in a white suburb and I can tell you that most of the white couples I see where the man is an average joe include a woman of average or larger size.|`|PM32r1rPaa	Let's be honest. Here's why....    1) White men, on average have more money than black or latino men.  2) Hot women tend to like guys with lots of $$$  3)Therefore, White guys can generally AFFORD to be picky|`|7sgJuukQaa	I don't think it's a colour thing.....it just depends on the guy your asking.|`|iad9mqaXaa	I don't see this as a bad thing. No one with taste will be seen in public with some slob. But their obsession with anorexics is definitely bad. Ex. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jessica Simpson.|`|t1VthewCaa	I don't know about all white guys but I have dated two before. I was pleasantly surprised that they even came at me the way they did. I am by no means fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm what a guy would refer to as "phat" and full lips. I do have long hair and I am light skinned, but I just didn't see it coming to be honest. One of the white guys was real "trailer park" too. He was like he thought he'd never date a black girl until we met. They were really cool though. One thing that I did notice about a white man versus a black man is that they seem to be a little more controlling and are surprised when you say certain things to them. I would definitely date another white man though.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	I have a whole family of white people, and a bunch of white friends. You can't generalize like that, even saying "usually" is not accurate. Some of my family has fat wives, some are gorgeous. How can you say "usually?"     I think people that have, or have had, pretty girlfriends have high self esteem. That may effect the way you look for girls. People that have dated hot girls might feel like they should because they could.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Paris Hilton is pretty???? wooot Heck no.   Fake hair color, fake eye color, fake face (had surgery), fake boobs, what's real about this girl!    That's the close up of her face and her new lips.

Men of color see there women in more then one way,I think men  of color tend to be more into women of different sized and looks,  I think that's A great attitude because know is alike, I myself is  Hispanic and Italian and the women tend to be short and kinda  curvy in my family.|`|mSVlAsGhaa	Yes. They are brainwashed from the time they are little boys. Not only by the media version of the perfect white woman but also by observing their mothers as they strive to fit that 'barbie' mold.  I am not sure why white men are more this way. It is surely something in upbringing as well as society.|`|GU9NHJXMaa	it's just you, my dear!|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	all people are picky about what they  want|`|4mpO3i8vaa	Yes! I demand only hot women. Got to keep the hot looking gene pool going. The ugly people breed at a faster rate so looks like I'm gonna have to step it up!!|`|38IZfJqiaa	one factor you didn't mention is maturity. Immature men look at women and think with their eyes. Mature men examine the entire person, not just the shell. I am married to a woman that I love and think is beautiful. She is 5'11 and weighs more than the women you listed above, but she has a great personality and is a wonderful mom too! When I was 17 I probably fit into the guy in which you are sterotyping, but now as a mature adult, I don't find those women attractive, because in most cases those 'hot women" having nothing more behind that shell. (now I'm stereotyping) Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and shallow attractive women with no personality don't do it for me.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	jessica and paris are dogs and no. some men are very superficial and some men are not. i find black men to be just as superficial as other races personally.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I think that society has directed the men to believing that a woman who is over 120 lbs is overweight, which is entirely not true.  I have this one friend (white male) who will only date tall white women with large breasts, and they have to weigh less than 130!  How picky is that!!  He won't date anyone that is shorter than 5'7", as a rule.|`|VEoURHoCaa	let me start out my saying Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton are ugly lol    i think Asian men are way more pickier then white men(just what i see) yea i think so most are but really it depends on the person. i mean theirs a lot of fat white women out there who only date in their race.|`|sEq75g5Zaa	There is nothing wrong with having high standards or liking people that actually have respect for themselves. Why lay down with a pig ...unless that's all you can get?|`|tEzWEmA2aa	From what I've seen white guys prefer girls who are built like 12 year old boys. That's their choice though|`|sNzCvfuBaa	I have noticed that white men (not all, but most) can be picky, but black men can be just as picky....but then again all men are picky in their own way (evil bastards)! lol|`|YBSDSSaxaa	im not racist at all bu yea I agree, its like all the white guys i know have such high standards or women...I don't get it.|`|WxjlBU13aa	No. I have met plenty of Latinos who care about a woman's size. Its just some guys in general tend to like women who are fit. Just like some guys like women who are a little extra curvy. It all depends on the dude, not really if he is white or not. But then again... who knows. And jessica simpson got fat recently and has a butt chin. And Paris Hilton has a huge nose. So if white guys Do like them, then they have not taste in woman.  Hope it helps you!

And what makes you think some muslims don't drink, buy pornography or eat pork products?  Just like in Christianity, not all muslims are practising.   As for smoking, that is not illegal in Islam. That is forbidden in Sikhism.  I am insulted by the insinuation that you think I personally hate you. I do not even know you.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I think you're a bit confused.

The Qu'ran teaches intolerance to non-Muslims (unbelievers).  I have read a lot of it, so Muslims that follow true Islam can deny it all they want, if their book teaches it then that is what Islam is about (If you don't like it, then maybe Islam isn't right for you).|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Omg generalizations.

But, you cannot blame the entire community because of one person. It would be devlish of you.|`|6W61fS5paa	You got it wrong, there is no such thing. Muslims are humans like christians. They can drink, watch porno, smoke etc.   Some radical muslims don't do these, I know that some christians are also don't do these and hate muslims.     This religious hatred makes nonsense. Islam accepts Moses, Jesus, Abraham and supports them. Abraham's religions are for uniting people, not to separate people and cause hatred between them.|`|JiaGiVexaa	The troll is back.

In Muslim countries, a lot of them want to come to the USA because they hear how great it is.|`|Mm18SDwVaa	First of all let me educate you my dear friend .Kafir is the one who is an idol worshiper.Who worship idols .So christians ,jews and muslims cannot be kafirs because they all believe in one GOD.Secondly Muslims dont hate non muslims it is mostly due to media activities  . I am Muslims my self and very well educated and very well travelled person and top of that married to a christian woman who is the love of my life .if that was the case of hating non muslims i wouldnt have done that .them read about Prophet Muhammad's(pbuh) life one of his wife was the daughter of a slave who was christian .Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) freed her family and marry her to prove the fact that christian and jews were not kafirs  and they need to be loved just like muslim love muslim.All the problem is because of the bunch of uneducated people who claims to be the religious gurus and became the infection in the systems.As far as hating some one i think muslims hate muslims more then any thing . i visited saudi arabia long time ago and was praying in the mosque . After the prayer i was kicked out of the mosque because i am shia muslims and they did not want me in the sunni mosque . I just pray to God to help those how are on the wrong track and all the problems will be solved but it is going to be very hard unless we all dedicate ourselves to do the right things.God bless|`|5EL12Tjuaa	As far as I know kafoor does not mean animals or scrums, it basically just means unbelievers, and you are not refered to that because Muslims are taught to respect other cultures if they want to gain respect, so I hope that clears out for you.   Your not show if kafoor came first or muslims but I think they both came together. Money doesn't only come from alcohol, cigarettes and stuff and if it did stop which I don't it will there's other things that makes you money such as clothes, drinks like coca cola, food, jewellery and ect. but it wouldn't only effect muslims but other people too not just a certain religion, I think it's not about religion it's just about people helping and feeding each other.    Muslims don't hate non-muslims, I know where some people can get that from, like when you meet a muslim who has a bad attitude you think other muslims are just the same but it is not true because everyone is different some muslims might think the same towards non-muslims, I am a muslim and I've got loads of friends from different religion and cultures and I respect there religion, which i was taught to do.

a1208f486df80a9010c503bf6d891c8eaa	I don't know about in the US, but in Ireland where the name comes from, the "GH" is not pronounced as F, it is pronounced a bit like CH in German or in the Scottish word Loch - a slightly softer version of the comic pronunciation of X in Mexico. The "I" is pronounced as in the word  "in", and the stress is on the first syllable.     Pronunciation of names in the US can be different, presumably because many people allowed the pronunciation of their names to slide into whatever was easiest for a community made up of people who had diverse language backgrounds.|`|REC4YgOuaa	KOFF-lun|`|DZB0WCmmaa	kaflin|`|XqpRYh52aa	Cofflin|`|aahbhllNaa	cuff-lin|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	I've known a lot of Coughlins. They all pronounced it KOFF-lun.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	I new I guy by that name once, he pronounced it CAHG-lin.|`|clHBMWpKaa	Could depend on where you are; you don't specify.   The -Cou- part is 'Kau', like 'cough', but the -gh- represents an Irish sound, like the Irish words 'Och!' or 'loch', as in "Loch Ness". "Loughlin" ('Loch linn') is exactly "Coughlin" ('Kough linn'), except for the initial 'C'.    I have heard broadcasters in England use a hard -g- sound, like ("Kogg linn") that is wrong, even offensive to Irish, (ignorance, speech defect, predjudice?), yet they always seem to say "Kenneth Branagh" better.     Every Coughlin I ever heard of, including Olympic sprinter Eamonn C., says it the Irish way. But it's true you do hear odd recreations of names in English countries, created in response to bigotry.    Example, on his TV show, US comic Bill Maher was once chided on his ancient "beautiful Irish name" by Irish ex-President Mary Robinson "and why don't you say it (Meagher)... ?". He insisted on "Maerr".    --------------------------------------...   Your best bet: ask nicely. "Excuse me, your name, is it Irish? Did I pronounce it right?" If she's Irish, hope she'll be impressed by your attempt at manners, if American, she'll love to talk about being Irish.

When I lived in Hong Kong for a year, I came back to Texas with some definite British English.  I think you just tend to repeat the sounds you hear and unconsciously imitate them.  You might try study a foreign language and see if you can actually learn the language with little "foreign" accent.|`|LIRbmKbtaa	pretty damn durable if you ask me|`|a5f9ff7596516a58763fd06c0cfcf987aa	It definitely sounds like it.

Maybe he feels you are handy, and available. But you'd think<br>  if he wanted to sew his oats, he'd try to approach someone not as in-<br>  volved with he or his wife. Another clue, that he's not thinking right.<br>  Well, they do say, a man has the urge til he's dead and buried. So I<br>  suppose this is proving the point. <br>    I think you have to be firm and rather than laugh it off, tell him out-<br>  right, that you want to remain friends, with he and his wife, but if he<br>  doesn't stop pestering you on the subject, you have no choice but<br>  to stop being friends with them. And his wife would surely want to <br>  know what happened to cause that. And he wouldn't want his wife<br>  to know he's been trying something behind her back. And he'd be<br>  unwilling to give up his home, and extras, just for a fling. The old<br>  codger, probably thinks he's still got it. Remind the old rooster, that<br>  he still has a hen in his hen house.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Make sure he totally understands he is compromising your friendship with them. Let it be known that the subject is permanently closed, never to be brought up again. Ask him to please respect your wishes, and not put you in an awkward position as he has. <br>  This is a tough one, just be careful of what and how you say things to him so he is not drawing on something that you do not intend him to. Nip it in the bud immediately and also ask him to please not call you as he has been doing. Be civil, but firm and direct when you speak to him. If he has any respect for his wife or even for the friendship, he will stop. If not, he is only looking out for himself, and I would not want to be friends with anyone put a friendship on the line as this. Good luck.

b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	Yes I believe we do, but I must say that forgetting is no easy task, but if we believe in God we know deep in our heart, that we must not only forgive we must forget. Just think if we were to always rehash our past hurts against us, how in all actuality would we really being forgiving...when our remembering would reopen the old wound, making forgiveness a falsehood. Life is not always easy, nor fir...but our faith will help us not only to forgive and forget, but to be stronger with God and truer to ourselves...also we all have sinned, and have been forgiven and God also forgets...what a strength forgiveness is, not a weakness..much easier to harbor hate, resentment,anger etc. than to forgive and forget.|`|t9htoO50aa	Forgiveness is not saying you are alright with what the person has done to you. It is letting go of it. If you don't let go and carry it with you, you are not hurting the person who did the wrong in the first place. My sister was murdered 25 years ago and I held onto the anger for 18 years. I met a girl who helped me to understand forgiveness. I was able to let it go and it took a huge load off of me. All my anger never hurt the guy who did it just me.|`|xWqKKp0Naa	sweetie , i believe in our Creator & yet i can forgive someone & still never forget .<br>  it does me no harm to not forget as i never want to have it happen again & that memory makes me aware but not a bad person.

I think it's nice to forgive but don't think you can always forget. If someone does something really bad to you how can you ever forget it? I think it's impossible to forget bad experiences just as it's impossible to forget good experiences. I forgive most things but some things in life fall into the unforgivable category and shouldn't be forgiven. I don't really hold grudges but almost :)|`|G6Uy43coaa	I forgive and I try to move on .  Unfortunately, when someone that I have forgiven for something wants to hold me to a higher standard than others in their lives and cannot offer me the compassion they so freely gave others, it hurts and I bring up their faults as a defense mechanism.  So although I will forgive, I tend not to forget depending on their actions towards me.|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	Hebrews 12:15 says "Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"<br>  <br>  I think this verse is kind of telling us that if we hold bitterness (or a grudge) in our heart, it could open the door for Satan to lead us away from God. So yes, I think we should forgive and forget. I do think that if someone keeps sinning against you, there is only so much forgetting that you can do until you just have to cut yourself of from that person.|`|67q4ElJtaa	Well, think about this:Since we do love ourselves, we would not want to burden ourselves needlessly, would we? Yet that is what we are doing when we nurse grudges and refuse to be forgiving, for as one person wrote: “A grudge is too heavy a load for any man to carry.”<br>  Wisely God’s Word counsels us: “Let the sun not set with you in a provoked state.” (Eph. 4:26) A deliberate effort should be made to write off the wrong and restore the fractured relationship as soon as possible, the very day the rupture takes place, if possible<br>  Yet, in most cases when our brothers sin against us, we can forgive in the sense of overcoming resentment and we can forget in the sense of not holding the matter against them indefinitely into the future.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	Honey, the lord tells us to forgive.  I don't remember him saying anything about forgetting.  That's how you guard yourself through learning.<br>  <br>  I used to pray and pray about forgiving my sister.  I used to wonder if God would understand that I didn't want her in my life anymore.  I prayed about it.  He showed me some passages.  One said not to rewelcome thieves into your home.

It also holds us back in life and hurts us more than it hurts the one who offended. The way it was explained to my husband is how I like to look at it. My honey had a baby sister, Susan that he was closest with out of his three siblings. Susan was shot by her estranged husband at point blank range with a shotgun. My husband has forgiven her husband, he does not condone what he did but he forgives so that he can move on in his life. So that the Heavenly Father can forgive him his sins, since all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. And forgiving this person helps us let go and let God take that so we don't have to carry all of our burdens, or else what was the point of Christ dying on the cross?<br>  Now Creator says in the Bible that He forgives us when we ask as far as the east is from the west. Like once we ask, it's over, if we bring it up again we'll look foolish or rude because He doesn't remember and will be saying to us if we keep bringing it back up, "Frankly sweet child I don't know what you are talking about."=OVER. Is this expected of us? Well, we should move on but whether we can forget as the Heavenly Father does is questionable, he's perfect, we are not yet until we meet Him in Glory. And in some cases it might be foolish to forget while we are still here in our earthly lives to forget some experiences completely. What if one was a victim of some abuse, wouldn't it benefit us to remember enough to be motivated to learn from the experience and trust our feelings and instincts and get ourselves out of situations that may be similar in the future?|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	As Christians we forgive so we can BE forgiven. When we forgive someone we do not have to have a relationship with that person, we don't have to tell that person they are forgiven only God needs to know that we have truly forgiven from our heart and no longer desire revenge or carry resentment or anger against the person. We do not forget what was done we just don't need to hang on to that moment in time. God does not require us to forget like it never happened, because if we did that, they could do the same thing again in the future. Forgiveness is a selfish decision and it is a decision to forgive. Forgiveness releases us from that moment in time so we can heal and be in relationship with Jesus and receive forgiveness in the same manner we gave it. What God does for us over time is lessen the pain of the memory, and lessen the times we remember. We can even feel love for that person over time and even pray for them to receive Jesus as savior. I know I forgave my rapist, and I have lifted him in prayer.

AA12059450	The actual word in the Greek text is the word from which "orphan" is derived... "Fatherless" was a 17th century English interpretation and not necessarily a valid translation of the word.<br>  <br>  Here is some background information on this Greek word which may help you understand its significance and use. This relates directly to Classical Greek, but the thought remained the same in New Testament times:<br>  <br>  "In secular Greek, orphanos is used from Homer onwards as an adjective meaning without parents, fatherless or more generally, bereaved, bereft of; and as a noun, orphan." (NIDNTT, v. 2, p. 737.)<br>  <br>  <br>  James' specific use here relates this basic idea: If a person claims to be a Christian but lacks ACTIVE CONCERN for the "downtrodden," then their claim is MEANINGLESS. <br>  <br>  Pulling this into a modern context, children of a "single mom" could fall into this category, but not all will. It is more to do with the "bereaved, bereft of" portion of the definition. It seems quite a stretch to automatically include the child of a millionaire celebrity in this category simply because the parent is single. In the more "general case," the passage certainly would apply however. <br>  <br>  I know several families where the parents are still married, but one of them is never around. This seems also to fit within the broader scope and meaning of the original language word.|`|OugNf0x6aa	Anyone who has no father.

lxQ8dLC5aa	The Bible speaks of Heaven, Earth, Hades (Matt. 16:18), Paradise (Luke 23:43), Abraham's side or Bosom (Luke 16:22), Hell (Matt. 5:29), death as a place (Rev. 1:18), the fiery lake of burning sulfur (Rev. 21:8) and the Abyss (Luke 8:31).<br>  <br>  With that in mind we need to start to put the pieces together. The Story of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) tells us that Lazarus went to the place were he stood by the side of the Patriarch Abraham (called in literature Abraham's Bosom). The Rich Man (known as Dives in literature) on the other hand went to a place called Hell. From this we can conclude that the after-life has at least two parts - Hell and this other place for righteous people.<br>  <br>  Now for another story in the Bible, the Bible tells us that when Jesus was crucified two robbers were also crucified. The robber on the left mocked Jesus and the one on the right asked to follow Jesus. The robber on the right, the penitent robber, (known in literature as Saint Dismas) went to Paradise with Jesus (Luke 23:43-). Therefore we know the place Lazarus went to was most likely also called Paradise. Now we have the names of a least two places people go to after they die - Hell and Paradise. <br>  <br>  Collectively, these places are called Hades in the Bible (Rev. 20:14).<br>  Hell is discussed in many places in the Bible. Matthew 5:22 warns of the danger of the fire of hell and Luke 16:23-24 tells us, hell is a place where people are tormented and the fire of hell keeps them in agony. Further, 1 Peter 3:19 says they are kept in prison.  And 2 Peter 2:4 tells us that even angels have been sent to hell. Hell is therefore reserved for the damned where they fearfully await the Lord's final, White Throne judgment (Rev. 20:11) in darkness or in fire . At the white throne judgment the goats (Matt. 25:33) those on the left will be cast into the eternal fire (Matt. 25:41) known as the fiery lake of burning sulfur (Rev. 21:8). After this Death and Hades will be also be thrown into the lake of fire and be no more. The lake of fire is the second death (Rev. 20:14).<br>  <br>  The third place where people can go is Heaven where Elijah went (2 Kings 2:1) and possibly Enoch (Gen. 5:2) and Moses (Jude 1:9). Elijah and Moses appeared in the Transfiguration of Christ described in Matthew 17:1-3, which would indicate they are in Heaven.<br>  <br>  Another place is the Abyss where the demon, Legion, asked Jesus not to send him (Luke 8:31) and where Satan comes out of (Rev. 17:8) and from which the stinging Locusts will come from (Rev. 9:1-11) and where Satan will spend one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). After which he will cast into lake of burning sulfur forever where the antichrist and the false prophet already are (Rev. 20:10).<br>  <br>  The last place is the 3rd Heaven mentioned by Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:2, "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know-God knows."

AA11047076	What you are understanding is a very surface understanding of what Ben Sirach taught and what is discussed in other Kabbalisitic sources.<br>  <br>  So let me try and explain it in simplistic terms.<br>  <br>  G-d is an unique singular being who has no sexuality or gender.  G-d is completely beyond those concepts and is not manifested physically that such a dsitinction would be meaningful in any way.<br>  <br>  So, what is Ben Sirach referring to here? <br>  <br>  There is a Kabbalistic concept of Ten sephirot (sphers) which are in a form of a ladder through which the essence of G-d is filtered through to this world.  These sephirot (also called the tree of life) act like lenses, the aspect which G-d chooses to show to us being the sephirah through which his essence is filtered into our world..<br>  <br>  Now some of these are seen as masculine as they are involved with kingship, judgement etc, others are seen seen as feminine since they are involved with understanding, nurture etc.  Now the three top sephirot are Chohcmah, Binah  and Da'at-<br>  <br>  - wisdom, knowledge and understanding.  Of these, Chochma is the feminine sephirh in its placement on the tree of life.  So what Ben Sirach is talking about here is the fact that the aspect of G-d involve din the creation was the feminine chochmah- wisdom, that hovered over the aters- imbuing the whole creation with wisdom, letting us know that the world was created with wisdom, and thus it has a higher understanding which, while beyond us, is imbued into the very essence of the world.<br>  <br>  As for what dominates- the masculine vs feminine- in Judaism that os a moot point.  G-d is neither, represents both and we see strength, virtue and the necessity for both in every aspect of life.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	When you get into the mysticism of Judaism, you find a LOT of male-female duality, and a recognition that since G-D is not a man, but spirit, that G-D is neither truly male nor female, being that G-D does not have, shall we say, certain definitive anatomical features.|`|DTog0VZWaa	JP & Paperback answered well (& others have added well since.)<br>  <br>  In Judasim there is no sense of God as masculine per se.  Only as abstract & complex.  So there is room for much in the understanding of God.  Since masculine endings in Hebrew are used both for males & for groups of male & female, the references don't give a sense of male the way they do in English.<br>  <br>  I'm going to conjecture that in ancient & pagan cultures there was often a focus on a female element of gods & fertility.  So it would be natural for Judasm's concepts to move away from that as they tried to move away from the other cultures ways of worship.  However, the idea of Shehina (I'm not spelling at all correctly), I thought was a old one, that there was always a sense of a female along with the male essenses.  <br>  <br>  My impression is that the male image in Judaism grew more out of contact with Christianity & it's male father figure image.  That's where I get that picture in my head - from all the Christian books & writings generally present.  If I look only at Jewish images, there is nothing like that & it's a much more abstract energy sense.  The "voice" heard by Abraham & Moses was always a voice, not a person, a presence is how it's described in Torah from the images of energy lighting up the crowd awaiting to hear from God.  (See national revelation, #4, & the links to Torah passages from there: <a href="http://www.simpletoremember.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpletoremember.org</a> )  The omnipotence was much more the presence in Judaism than any humanness.  <br>  <br>  Even in Torah there is a sense of the famous women connecting with God themselves (though not through the voice) but as though they have an easier time & don't need all the existential means.  They are very much a part of the stories, & influencing them & the directions the stories go in.  Miriam was a guide & critical to Moses's actions, Rebecca decides who gets the birthright, and on.  So that vibration with God in a female way is present & implies that God is not male, is not for males & is not a male world.  God has a connection to women.  Therefore God must contain some female element.  <br>  <br>  God in Judaism also involved connection with earth & trees (Tu'B'shvat, argricultural laws), which is so female in all religions, so it isn't left out in Judaism either.<br>  <br>  In Judaism there isn't a submissiveness required of women.  It's just not there.  While men & women traditionally have different roles, some of those roles elevate women's power particularly in the home & family.  Within marriages it's rare for a male to say "he's the one in charge."  It's more of a shared arrangement.  Fiddler on the Roof described it just fine.<br>  <br>  =====================<br>  Starpent<br>  You are mixing up your literal reading of the books, wtih Judaism.  Judaism reads them with methods that go way beyond literal.  You're bashing, your own reading but not understanding how Judaism contains the works & what JUDAISM sees in them.  Furthermore, Judaism has always understood that they were history telling of the times in a male dominated culture - so it adjusted for that problem - simply acknowledged it.  <br>  <br>  It's not that women are "unclean" but are spiritually unpure - AS men can be & it describes.  It often is very hard for a non-Jewish person (such as one raised in a Christian focused  world) to image how Judasim functions or absorbs our own books.  What I described wasn't the exceptions.  They are key elements to any Jewish perception.  A lot of the main reduction of that perception arrived during the time periods living with Christianity (as I described.)  If you were raised Jewish, then you haven't spent enough time in Jewish study classes.<br>  <br>  Also the question wasn't about gender equality at all.  It was about the female essenses of God & when & how they existed in Judaism.  They do exist in Judaism & have a long & full history.  From what I gather they are not present in Christianity at all - & often people are surprised to find them when they come to Judaism.<br>  <br>  Thanks Moo.  You hit a whole bunch of points I skipped over very well!!|`|TVJsOEKNaa	I am not sure about this specific excerpt but perhaps I can help to explain a few concepts which may be helpful.<br>  <br>  In Judaism, God simply has no gender, shape, or form. The Torah mentions God in both feminine and masculine terms in order to express this idea. <br>  <br>  Lets take a random object like a printer and apply this concept: When you think about it, is a printer specifically male or female? Of course not! -- The very implication that a printer has a gender seems like an alien concept in itself right? The printer simply is. <br>  <br>  God is also looked at in a similar fashion -- not exclusively male or female.  Trying to place a gender on God is just as awkward as trying to place a gender on a chair.  <br>  <br>  Does God have different attributes? The simple answer is yes.  The different names for HaShem also help to give us an idea of this.  This kind of duality lies within many Jewish concepts. <br>  <br>  The goal is not to say one gender is better than another, rather to express the different attributes and qualities that the genders have. This is dualistic in its' own right and psychologists emphasize that while both genders are inherently the same in nature -- they each possess characteristics and attributes that are unique. <br>  <br>  The articles linked below help to answer your question (specifically the first one) on the different characteristics/attributes that God possesses.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  ---------<br>  Oh god starpent here we go:<br>  <br>  "It's a wonder that many Jews and Christians don't realize that those books also say a woman is 'unclean' during her period or after childbirth"<br>  <br>  Stop right there: Christianity and Judaism are two separate beliefs and ideologies.  Anyone who combines the two is in serious need of a theology lesson.  <br>  <br>  Our texts aren't even the same: Christianity follows the OT/NT while Judaism follows the Tanach/Talmud (Tanach being Torah/Prophets/Writings - Talmud being Oral law).  They are different in wording, translation, interpretation and application when compared to Christianity. <br>  <br>  Secondly: Jewish people are quite aware of the laws of separation in regards to niddah (menstruation) and child birth. Spiritual (not literal) impurity is a completely different topic.  <br>  <br>  The laws of separation simply mean that a husband and wife refrain from sexual relations during menstruation.  If you are going to do a comparative analysis, lets include the *many* cultures and religions who have historically followed similar guidelines in the past, shall we? <br>  <br>  Now, if you can name me ALL of those cultures: I'll disregard the fact that you basically told Jewish people we don't know about our own faith. <br>  <br>  Third:<br>  <br>  Have you ever had a child?  I have (I have a one and a half year old daughter who is an absolute joy).  <br>  <br>  Let me tell you something: Having sex is the LAST thing on your mind after having a child.  The only thing on your mind after having a child -- is spending time nursing/caring for your child, recuperating from the stitches/pain and resting.  <br>  <br>  Those laws were put in place for a very good reason.  Physicians even request to refrain from having sex with your significant other for a certain time frame after having a child: Are you going to imply that they are misogynistic as well? <br>  <br>  "...a few key women's names-like Noah's wife or daughters-in-law or Moses' wife...there are other examples where women are obviously ALWAYS the inferior ones when it comes to men. "<br>  <br>  Differences between Judaism and Christianity once again: <br>  <br>  - Naamah, daughter of Lemech was Noah's wife (Gen. 4:22)<br>  - Did you mean to say Tzipporah, Moses's wife in Yitro?<br>  - Judaism holds that there are several prophetess's: Christianity does not.<br>  <br>  *Please do research before making ignorant statements. <br>  <br>  "There's some junk about women being worth kess shekels than a male.."<br>  <br>  -- Did you mean in reference to working on a field and payment? Yea: Women didn't get paid as much to sow a field according to the King's decree of a specific story where you're taking this from.<br>  <br>  PS Starpent: Are you even aware that many Jewish women pioneered the feminism movement? Probably not ...|`|mYpVOSKfaa	The Divine spirit you mention is the Spirit of God.  In fact, in Genesis 1:1, this spirit is identified.  "And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters."  The Book of Wisdom mentions a female spirit, created by God to help Him with creation, but I haven't encountered her in any other book; and, considering I don't believe that the book of Wisdom fits Biblical cannon, I don't think there actually was a spirit named "Wisdom" .

Athens in ancient Greece was a prime example of this. The city was named for the goddess Athena, and she was by far, one of the more important deities to Athenians, however, Athenian women, unless they were poor or prostitutes, lead very oppressed lives. Much like women under the taliban in Afghanistan, they were not to be seen in public. If a married women went out, she was to veil herself and she was not allowed to roam around the city. Women other than prostitutes were forbidden from many public places and were generally held in low regard and even thought of with disdain. However it's not uncommon in such societies for negative attitudes towards women to stem from the fact that the men often felt helpless in their emotions towards women....in other words, men often felt women held some supernatural power over them and so had to be oppressed.<br>  <br>  In judaism though, this generally isn't the case. Most interpretations of judaism hold that women are spiritually superior than men, and so most of the rituals are focus is male oriented because men are more liable to stray from a righteous path and must be kept on a tighter rope, so to speak.

To find out what the future of this world will be according to the bible go to www.watchtower.org.<br>  <br>  Who Really Rules the World?<br>  <br>  Many people would answer the above question with a single word—God. But significantly, nowhere does the Bible say that either Jesus Christ or his Father are the real rulers of this world. On the contrary, Jesus said: “The ruler of this world will be cast out.” And he added: “The ruler of the world is coming. And he has no hold on me.”—John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11.<br>  <br>  So the ruler of this world is in opposition to Jesus. Who could this be?<br>  <br>  A Clue From World Conditions<br>  <br>  Despite the efforts of well-meaning humans, the world has suffered terribly throughout history. This causes thinking persons to wonder, as did the late editorial writer David Lawrence: “‘Peace on earth’—nearly everybody wants it. ‘Good will toward men’—almost all the peoples of the world feel it toward one another. Then what’s wrong? Why is war threatened despite the innate desires of peoples?”<br>  <br>  It seems a paradox, doesn’t it? When the natural desire of people is to live at peace, they commonly hate and kill one another—and with such viciousness. Consider the cold-blooded excesses in monstrous cruelty. Humans have used gas chambers, concentration camps, flamethrowers, napalm bombs, and other heinous methods to torture and slaughter one another mercilessly.<br>  <br>  Do you believe that humans, who long for peace and happiness, are capable, in themselves, of such gross wickedness against others? What forces drive men to such loathsome deeds or maneuver them into situations where they feel compelled to commit atrocities? Have you ever wondered whether some wicked, invisible power is influencing people to commit such acts of violence?<br>  <br>  The Rulers of the World Identified<br>  <br>  There is no need to guess at the matter, for the Bible clearly shows that an intelligent, unseen person has been controlling both men and nations. It says: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” And the Bible identifies him, saying: “The one called Devil and Satan .?.?. is misleading the entire inhabited earth.”—1?John 5:19; Revelation 12:9.<br>  <br>  On an occasion when Jesus was “tempted by the Devil,” Jesus did not question Satan’s role as the ruler of this world. The Bible explains what happened: “The Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him: ‘All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.’ Then Jesus said to him: ‘Go away, Satan!’”—Matthew 4:1, 8-10.<br>  <br>  Think about this. Satan tempted Jesus by offering him “all the kingdoms of the world.” Yet, would Satan’s offer have been a real temptation if Satan was not actually the ruler of these kingdoms? No, it would not. And note, Jesus did not deny that all these worldly governments were Satan’s, which he would have done if Satan did not have power over them. So, then, Satan the Devil really is the unseen ruler of the world! The Bible, in fact, calls him “the god of this system of things.” (2?Corinthians 4:4) Yet, how did such a wicked person ever come into this powerful position?<br>  <br>  The one who became Satan had been an angel created by God, but he became envious of God’s position. He challenged God’s rightful rulership. To this end he used a serpent as a mouthpiece to deceive the first woman, Eve, and was thus able to get her and her husband, Adam, to do his bidding rather than obey God. (Genesis 3:1-6; 2?Corinthians 11:3) He also claimed he could turn all of Adam and Eve’s yet unborn offspring away from God. So God allowed time for Satan to try to prove his claim, but Satan has not succeeded.—Job 1:6-12; 2:1-10.<br>  <br>  Significantly, Satan is not alone in his rulership of the world. He was successful in persuading some of the other angels to join him in rebellion against God. These became demons, his spirit accomplices. The Bible speaks of them when it urges Christians: “Stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but .?.?. against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.”—Ephesians 6:11,?12.<br>  <br>  Resist Wicked Spirits<br>  <br>  These unseen, wicked world rulers are determined to mislead all mankind, turning them away from the worship of God. One way wicked spirits do this is by promoting the idea of survival after death, even though God’s Word clearly shows that the dead are not conscious. (Genesis 2:17; 3:19; Ezekiel 18:4; Psalm 146:3,?4; Ecclesiastes 9:5,?10) Thus, a wicked spirit, imitating the voice of one who has died, may talk with that one’s living relatives or friends, either through a spirit medium or by a “voice” from the invisible realm. The “vo|`|9PoGLVmXaa	No, God is also responsible for punishments. But I am thankful that He is long suffering and will still take us back and make things right if we turn back to Him.

For example,  Rhinoceros Unicorns, Acanthochelys/Actinemys<br>  <br>  Fossils<br>  95% of all fossils are shallow marine organisms, such as corals and shellfish. <br>  95% of the remaining 5% are algae and plants. <br>  95% of the remaining 0.25% are invertebrates, including insects. <br>  The remaining 0.0125% are vertebrates, mostly fish. (95% of land vertebrates consist of less than one bone, and 95% of mammal fossils are from the Ice Age after the Flood.)The number of dinosaur fossils is actually relatively small, compared to other types of creatures. Since the Flood was a marine catastrophe, we would expect marine fossils to be dominant in the fossil record. And that is the case.<br>  <br>  And Cavemen? Did we evolve from apes or what?

If we turn our backs on God and refuse to have anything to do with Him, then we will eventually pay the consequences for our stubbornness.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't need to be this way! God is our loving Heavenly Father, and He yearns to forgive us and welcome us back to Himself. He loves us so much that He has done everything possible to win us back, by sending His only Son into the world to pay the price for our sins. We deserve to die for our sins—but when Christ died on the cross, all our sins were placed in Him, and He took the punishment we deserve. The Bible says, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).<br>  <br>  Jesus warned, "Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin" (Mark 3:29). Blaspheming the Holy Spirit simply means saying that what the Holy Spirit says in the Scriptures about Christ is false. When we do that, we reject Christ and all He has done for us—and we are committing the only unforgivable sin.<br>  <br>  May that not happen to you, or to anyone else reading this post. Instead, turn to Christ and by a simple prayer of faith invite Him into your life today. Jesus' promise is for you: "Whoever comes to me I will never drive away" (John 6:37).|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well the early monks almost unanimously cited SLOTH as the very worst.<br>  I think this data shows the ignorance and lack of intellectual virtue in those surveyed.

Exactly how did Busa get his information?  Recollections of priests? And how wide was his sample?  If it was just the vicinity of Rome, he may simply be sampling Roman cultural values.  Perhaps because women are inculturated to be submissive and humble, they confess sins of pride more often. And why is it "avarice" for women and "greed" for men?

RuOTJLyvaa	Convincing mankind he does not exist|`|iAXmdQOEaa	A couple of things on satan.  Satan is a Hebrew word meaning adversary or enemy.   That's all it means.  In latter years it was capitalized to make it a person in the middle ages.   <br>  <br>  It will be noted that in Psalm 109:6 and Zechariah 3 :1-2, where they have 'Satan' in the text, they have 'adversary' in the margin, dissolving any support for the personal Devil theory. In fact, in three other places in the same Psalm, they have rendered the same word correctly as 'adversary' And even in v. 6 where they have 'Satan: the universal principle of parallelism in Hebrew poetry - (saying the same thing twice in different words: see Psalm 105 all through for a striking example) - confirms the true meaning -<br>  <br>  But what does the Bible say? AN IMMORTAL SINNER IS A SCRIPTURAL IMPOSSIBILITY If there is one thing the Scriptures make plain, it is the inseparability of Sin and Death --<br>  <br>  This is God's immutable law. He is righteous and holy, and this universe is His. It has no place for immortal sinners. Immortality is related only to holiness. Immortal sinners are a pagan superstition. The myths of the heathen are full of them. Similarly, and on the same premise, a sinning immortal is a scriptural impossibility.<br>  <br>  There is no Hebrew word for "devil" or "satan a fallen angel".   no word for bad angel in the bible!!!<br>  <br>  We have to remember that angels are immortal and cannot sin!!!   They are perfect, sinless and praise God everyday.   So the word satan and devil must mean something else.......  and it does.  LIke I stated before,  they are just Hebrew and Greek words that mean adversary or enemy.   Jesus called Peter satan,  so is Peter really satan???   Why dont we know Peter is really satan?  Because we know he is really not and that Jesus was just calling him his adversary.  Peter did something that Jesus didnt like.  That's all.  <br>  <br>  We really need to think about what the bible really says about words....<br>  <br>  1 TIM 4 V 1  "Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,"|`|AA11048813	That if you don't believe the way fundamentalist Christians (or Muslims or Jews) do you are damned.<br>  <br>  Any religious statement that divides people is Satanic.|`|1NTjyGblaa	Which do you believe, is the best lie that santa ever came up with?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I haven't actually been told a lie by satan or santa.|`|xrl96EHTaa	I don't believe in Satan, however, the best lie out there has to be "God created everything"|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	Convincing people that he and Hell are not real.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	There is no Satan.

Either, (1.) “It is not certain that you shall die,” so some. “It is not so sure as you are made to believe it is.” Thus Satan endeavours to shake that which he cannot overthrow, and invalidates the force of divine threatenings by questioning the certainty of them; and, when once it is supposed possible that there may be falsehood or fallacy in any word of God, a door is then opened to downright infidelity. Satan teaches men first to doubt and then to deny; he makes them sceptics first, and so by degrees makes them atheists. Or, (2.) “It is certain you shall not die,” so others. He avers his contradiction with the same phrase of assurance that God had used in ratifying the threatening. He began to call the precept in question (Gen_3:1), but, finding that the woman adhered to that, he quitted that battery, and made his second onset upon the threatening, where he perceived her to waver; for he is quick to spy all advantages, and to attack the wall where it is weakest: You shall not surely die. This was a lie, a downright lie; for, [1.] It was contrary to the word of God, which we are sure is true. See 1Jo_2:21, 1Jo_2:27. It was such a lie as gave the lie to God himself. [2.] It was contrary to his own knowledge. When he told them there was no danger in disobedience and rebellion he said that which he knew, by woeful experience, to be false. He had broken the law of his creation, and had found, to his cost, that he could not prosper in it; and yet he tells our first parents they shall not die. He concealed his own misery, that he might draw them into the like: thus he still deceives sinners into their own ruin. He tells them that, though they sin, they shall not die; and gains credit rather than God, who tells them, The wages of sin is death. Note, Hope of impunity is a great support to all iniquity, and impenitency in it.

Hell was originally prepared for the Devil and his angels (Mat. 25:41), but, since man chose to enter the domain of sin and death, Hell has become his place of torment as well. We read in Revelation 20:14 that Hell will eventually be cast into the "lake of fire." <br>  For those who are opposed to "hell fire preachers, " you may find it interesting to note that "hell fire" was first used by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ Himself (Mat. 5:22; Mar. 9:47).

WsZPwSX1aa	Yes, I agree. If Judaism is careless about the afterlife. Christianity is full of nonesense. Islam is the one true religion.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	No, I don't.<br>  <br>  Having studied them all, both in theory and in real world practice, I find that Judaism is the most spiritual of the three because it recognizes the spiritual in the material (try eating a meal at an Orthodox Jewish house -- there are blessings after blessings after blessings for every single aspect of the meal).  Islam mirrors Judaism in some regards.  Christianity, however, so thoroughly demonizes and rejects the material that it becomes its own counterpoint, and becomes entirely materialistic in its rejection of materialism.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  Actually, most of the people on Forbes' top ten list are atheists, agnostics, or deists.|`|4sUqTjc8aa	Spirituality, in a narrow sense, concerns itself with matters of the spirit, a concept closely tied to religious belief and faith, a transcendent reality, or one or more deities. Spiritual matters are thus those matters regarding humankind's ultimate nature and meaning, not only as material biological organisms, but as beings with a unique relationship to that which is perceived to be beyond the bodily senses, time and the material world. Spirituality in this sense implies the mind-body dichotomy, which indicates a separation between the body and soul. But spirituality may also be about the development of the individual's inner life through specific practices.<br>  <br>  I found in my studies of religion that the Buddhists are the most spiritual, over Judaism and (Christianity for sure). They believe they have shared insight of sentient beings that help end suffering by understanding the true nature of phenomena, thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth (sa?sāra), that is, achieving Nirvana. Among the methods various schools of Buddhism apply towards this goal are: ethical conduct and altruistic behaviour, devotional practices, ceremonies and the invocation of bodhisattvas, renunciation of worldly matters, meditation, physical exercises, study, and the cultivation of wisdom.  They are also kind beyond anything we can perceive.<br>  <br>  I don't feel Materiality has any place with Spirituality as defined. In fact, they are very opposite.<br>  <br>  All religions embrace spirituality but some religions feel that unless you subscribe to their particular belief set that you are not considered spiritual. Christians are so caught up with their beliefs, that the Religion itself becomes a materialistic possession. Some go as far to say that unless you are a member of religion, it is impossible to be spiritual. I don't agree. I prefer those who are on a "spiritual journey" far more than those who are on a "religious" journey.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, hope it stirs up thought.|`|0yTM98Odaa	No I don't.  Why is Judaism materiality?|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: disagree.  I believe you're approaching this from a Christian bias. We're taught that Jesus preached poverty and self-denial of wealth, education, etc and Christians find the acceptance and embrace of those by Judaism as threatening and not spiritual.<br>  <br>  That's not the case. If one is blessed by G-d with success we are mandated to share that success with those less fortunate (and there is always someone less fortunate).  Education was often viewed with hostility in Christianity but always embraced by Judaism as well.  <br>  <br>  There are spiritual/religious Christians, Jews, pagans, Muslims - no one has the corner market on being religious.
Yw1k1W19aa	'Do they work?' depends upon what you want to use them for. There are broadly three uses.<br>  <br>  Tarot cards were created in the mid 15th century Italy for the Milanese court. They comprise of a standard pack of Latin suited playing cards and an additional suit of picture cards. These extra cards took as their theme, not an occult philosophy or magical symbols but a Christian triumph procession, hence their early name of trionfi, meaning triumph and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the introduction of trumps in card games - and this is what they were invented for, a family of card games that continues to be played throughout continental Europe to this day.<br>  <br>  For this purpose, no myth, they work. Let's face it, any game that spreads throughout the continent and endures for 600 years is going to be good!<br>  <br>  As for fortune telling with tarot, well, without an occult origin, this is no different in kind as fortune telling with tea leaves, dominoes or knuckle bones - and so just as hard to take seriously. There are also objections to the notion of knowing the future from both philosophy and science, as it falls foul of the the same logical problems and paradoxes that plague time travel. So, no, I don't think that works.<br>  <br>  Some people also use tarot cards to represent their spiritual beliefs and meditate upon them. Well, in so far as they see their beliefs in the cards, they will suit that use just fine. So, for this, I would say they will work fine.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Tarot cards are simply a tool to help one access their subconscious minds and bring forth information to the conscious mind.  This is how they provide "answers" to your questions.  They use symbolism and numerology to help you take a look at your life situations from different angles.<br>  <br>  They work for those who learn how to use them properly.  Their purpose isn't really to attempt to "tell the future".  But a reading that assesses your current life situations will give you some insights into what the outcome is likely to be - based on the current heading you are on.  We make thousands of decisions every day that may alter the course of our life's path.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/</a>|`|c9cTrfqEaa	I have fortune cards and they always some managed to read whats going on i guess its the way they are interpreted|`|AA11605393	MYTH<br>  <br>  no such thing as being able to read your future, etc.|`|7ZRv62Hjaa	Yes they do.

Supposedly it is the person who picks the cards who has the power, so the actual cards are not significant. I personally think that we read what we want to read from them and this is usually the truth, but you could have read them in countless other ways as well. But they can help you organize your thoughts and if you know that they aren't really magical, they can help you psychologically mature.

Rt4bJfVAaa	I think the biggest concern for me is how different species can appear simultaneously.  Stay the same for how many years.  And some can even become extinct.  And that new species appear spontaneously.  And the fossil record itself bears this out.  There is a huge lack of transitional fossils to bear this out. <br>  <br>  This is explained in the link below.  And here are some key points with the conclusion as well.<br>  <br>  The second line of attack is to underline the gross unfactuality of ‘descent with modification’. The reality, for the naturalist and for domestication, is that ‘like produces like’. Darwin’s contemporary critics (among them Thomas Huxley) objected that the fossil record is completely at odds with the gradualist thesis. Instead of continuous change, we find long periods of stasis, followed by wholly new assemblages of taxa with no evidence of gradual change. The Wallace-Darwin response was to speculate that as the fossil record expands, it will document the currently missing gradual changes. The casuistry of this response is well exposed by L?vtrup. Suffice to point out one fatal objection: the fact of stasis by itself falsifies the gradualist principle. End of theory. <br>  <br>  As for Darwin being careful in his research here is the conclusion:<br>  <br>  the eminent physiologist Walter F. Cannon: ‘Two of Darwin’s chief virtues were ones not usually praised in a scientist: jumping to conclusions which go well beyond the evidence available; and maintaining his faith in his position regardless of the valid arguments that could be brought against it’. <br>  <br>  Evolution itself is a theory under attack not by nonbelievers but scientists themselves who wish to escape the notion or charge that they are dogmatists equal to religionists in their presentation.<br>  <br>  As for me believing in a creator it's not that the answer is a default one.  For me it is more logical to believe it.  Because of the intelligence and complexity of design of each living thing.  And that variation can occur yet one species does not blur into another one.  A rose by any other name is still a rose.  Plus lack of fossils as well.<br>  <br>  Later.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	You were born, that's creation.....you live in a mysterious universe that had a beginning, that's creation....The biblical account of creation is a beautiful metaphorical way to explain what we still don't understand.

Ne9rXERpaa	Simple -- by staying mired in the 19th Century and pretending like the last 150 years haven't happened, they can attack evolutionary theory when it was weakest.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	Chuck D is my homeboy!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, many Christians; as in Creationists, do nothing to substantiate their claims. All they due is resort to lies, quote mining and outright ridiculous made up "theories" of their own.<br>  <br>  I would like Creationists/Intelligent Design proponents to come up with a sound scientific theory that is an alternate to Evolution without attacking it. They think by attacking Evolution it makes the Genesis account true. If I believe the creation story of the Mayan Popol Vuh is true and attacked Evolution, would that mean the Creation story of the Mayans was true?!|`|f0JLp4hFaa	I don't understand why they criticize Darwin and evolution at all!<br>  <br>  Most Young Earth Creationists seem to focus only on evolution as the science that challenges Biblical Creation, but in fact many sciences are incompatible with Young-Earth Creationism:<br>  <br>  1. Most of biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry, genetics, comparative morphology, developmental embryology, immunology, bacteriology, virology, zoology, and botany ... all of these fields are so reliant on evolution as a central *CORE* idea. that to deny evolution would reduce them to disconnected, unrelated shreds.<br>  <br>  2. All of taxonomy and cladistics ... the *classification* of organisms into a hierarchical *tree* of related groupings. The entire structure of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, subspecies breaks down without evolution (and diverging ancestry) to *explain* it.<br>  <br>  3. Much of medicine. The development of vaccines and antibiotics depend on evolutionary principles, as well as epidemiology (predicting where the next epidemics will arise from last years bacteria and flu viruses). The treatment of diseases such as AIDS, where we use evolutionary principles to control the mutations of viruses, and keep their population from rebounding. The testing of medicines on animals (as knowing what animals share what systems with us depends on knowing evolutionary relationships ... e.g. knowing what kinds of insulin are candidates for human use would be reduced to total guesswork without an understanding of evolution). Etc., etc.<br>  <br>  4. All of paleontology (the study of fossils). Everything from the way fossils are dated, to how they are compared structurally, to stratigraphy and biogeography (the depth and location of fossil finds) has to be rejected outright to avoid admitting evidence of long-term evolution.<br>  <br>  5. Most of geology. From continental drift, to basic geologic timescales, to the mechanics of igneous and sedimentary rock formation (as these mechanisms are key to dating fossils), to the mechanics of erosion (as these are key to explaining things such as the exposure of polystrate fossils/petrified forests to the formation of the grand canyon or the burgess shale and the fossils they contain).<br>  <br>  6. Physics of radioactivity. As this is the basics for the science of radiometry ... measuring the age of rocks and fossils based on radioactive decay. A creationist has to reject the basic notion that radioactivity is constant ... but to such an absurd degree that the phycisists, geologists, and geochronologists are off by *MANY* orders of magnitude.<br>  <br>  7. Physics of light ... including Einstein's theory of relativity. If the creationist insists on a young age not only of life and the earth, but of the Biblical age of the *universe*, then they have to reject the basic relativity result that the speed of light is a constant. A widely variable speed of light is the only way they can refute the distance of far galaxies into the billions of light-years away.<br>  <br>  8. Most of astronomy and astrophysics and all of modern cosmology. Including the processes for the formation of the earth, stars (like the sun), and galaxies ... as these establish the *timescales* during which life on earth could have evolved. E.g. the age of the earth as established by geologists by dating rocks, is confirmed by astrophysicists by their calculation of the age the sun and its planets, and by astronomers by observing similar stars to the sun.<br>  <br>  <br>  ... But wait! There's more.<br>  <br>  Besides all the specific fields mentioned above, the creationist also rejects the very BASICS of science. By this I don't just mean mangling basic concepts such as the 2nd law of thermodynamics, or information theory. But things like demanding that supernatural explanations become a part of scientific explanations. Or mangling the concept of "theory" as if it meant "unproven fact." (Hint: a theory is NOT an "unproven fact" ... it is an *EXPLANATION* for facts.) Or thinking that science is based on "proof" instead of *EVIDENCE*. Or that science is about what you *believe*, when science is really about what you *understand*.<br>  (list courtesy of Y!A member secretsauce)<br>  <br>  So basically, you can choose a dogmatic, literal interpretation of the Bible that most Christians reject, or you can choose to accept the validity of science.<br>  Why I left young earth creationism: <a href="http://home.entouch.net/dmd/gstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.entouch.net/dmd/gstory.htm</a><br>  What you must deny to deny evolution: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nj587d5ies&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nj587d5i...</a>|`|3e24a6214bf0826951332197b013d146aa	when someone believes Darwins theory is crap, they arent impressed with expanding on that crap. <br>  when people focus on dispelling false teachings, they go to the source. darwin is the source.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	150 years since and yet, science still cant disprove God.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -Christian|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I never argued against Darwin by denying that in "the last 150 years scientists have expanded on his theories" !

I've had this debate many times, but still Judaism is not a race it is a religion.<br>  <br>  When you are a Jew it means you practice the Jewish religion. Jewish people are from all over the world not only Israel. The reason we look like Jews from Israel is because<br>  <br>  1. Maybe your Jewish ancestors are in fact from Israel. Which would then make you Israeli (which is a nationality)<br>  2. Your Jewish ancestors are from a countrylike Hungary where the natives share very similiar looks. After all it's from the same part of the world.<br>  <br>  The best way I've ever defended myself in the debate of whether being Jewish was a nationality or not was by saying this.<br>  <br>  Italians are from Italy<br>  Germans- Germany<br>  Hungarians- Hungary<br>  Syrian -Syria<br>  <br>  These are all NATIONALITIES.<br>  <br>  Where are Jewish people from... Jewland??<br>  <br>  Most people will answer Israel. When in fact if you are from Israel you are Israeli. Not all people from Israel are of Jewish faith, though don't get me wrong MANY of them are.<br>  <br>  Jews are from all over the world and look many different ways. Although we associate dark features with being Jewish, I do in fact have a blonde hair blue eyed grandfather who is %100 Jewish. His family is from Austria. Making him an Austrian Jew.<br>  <br>  Hitler used a stereotype to classify people as Jews. Which is why he killed Gypsies as well because heritage wise they shared many similiar characterisitics to Jewish people.<br>  <br>  Stereotypes are innacurate. Like I did say many Jewish people share similiar characteristics but that's just because they descend from ancestors from similiar regions of the world.<br>  <br>  To sum this up being a Jew means you follow the Jewish religion as opposed to Catholicism, Buddism, Hinduism, etc. Either a Jewish person is born from a Jewish mother or converts at some point in life. A child is not a Jew if born from a Jewish father and Non-Jewish mother. Which I think is why many people debate this because people can be %100 Jewish but not follow that particular religion.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps....<br>  <br>  Sorry for rambling.|`|rCF8UtNTaa	Who cares what people say?

T389Yzi3aa	I am a fervent christian....and I agree with you :-)<br>  <br>  I know christians that are doing time for murdering....when they were "christians".<br>  <br>  I know Athiests that are some of the most MORAL people I know.<br>  <br>  God says that he has written his law on the hearts of men.  We are born with the instinct that we are not "supposed" to kill or sleep with our kids or steal someones spouse....but there are times we do it.  Just because of circumstances and we rationalize....<br>  <br>  Christians rationalize telling a "white lie"  and they rationalize raping their own children.....Athiests do the same thing.  Without forgiveness both have the same fate.  Its not about one group doing it and another group doesnt.....its about ONE group eventually realizes they REALLY screwed up and that there IS a way to find forgiveness.  <br>  <br>  That is the only difference....now, do they get forgiven by the people they have hurt on this earth?  Many times no.  But they do find a way to CHANGE and they get forgiveness from the God they believe in.|`|AFNiSC6eaa	No i dont. I think by instinct human's don't kill. We aren't predetors. We might steal because we are scavengers. But even long before christianity people had there own morals. Before Catholism the romans weren't very relegious. They had a better social life then we did. Very little crime or racism or anything of that sort. Mostly because people got what they wanted most of the time. If two people wanted to have sex, they would. Why not? That society made a lot more sense to me. Religion often twists our morals into things that don't make sense.

They don't have souls. God gave a human free will to choose their path. He gave them a conscious and a mind. He made man in his own image. Only the fool tells himself that there is no God. Every creature and all creation praises Him daily! Only foolish men convince themselves to ignorance. The spiritual world is much more real than this world. Go ask people who practice magic and calling of spirits, they will tell you that heaven and hell is real. and so is God. So please don't fool yourself.

Every activity of every other animal can be reabsorbed into the environment.<br>  <br>  My point is that,  we are such a trajically intelligent species, that even if YOU feel that atheism will not cause violence, there will be very MANY that will use it as an excuse for disruptive behaviour.<br>  <br>  <br>  When we start saying things like " everyone makes his own morals"<br>  <br>  we are tredding on a thin line between harmonious living, and chaos.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Plenty of Christians use the Bible to propagate their own personal agendas.

It's because s/he is afraid of losing power.  I beleive that the people who say mean things instead of a, "I beleive that this will give you a happy afterlife.  Take it or leave it, it's up to you,' are afraid because they aren't sure.  They were born with this religeon but were never allowed to explore.  They were given the Book but not allowed to read between the lines.  So they find comfort in numbers, and the more numbers that they have, the more confort that they have.  There is something in the back of their mind screaming, "What if it's not true??  What if it's not real??"  And so while the people who say these things beleive they're helping another person, they're really taking a security blanket with them so that they don't fear quite as much.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to generalize and say that all Christians are mean people who go around saying mean things to other religeons.  But missionaries have always irked me in a way I couldn't get over easilly.  If they truely cared about other people, they would be QUESTIONING the Lord.  It may seem a nasty thing to say, but Christianity condems more than half the world's population to burn in hell because they don't beleive.  And so missionaries, instead of thinking, "why is that?  What would it be that the Lord of mercy would condem his people to an eternal suffering?' they go out to these countries who are content with their beleifs and try to convert them.  I wouldn't say that every missionary is like this.  To mention it over the dinner table is one thing.  But to go out disturbing people's everyday lives to turn them into Christians seems too bold, and a bit rude.  But, then again, that's just me.  I personally think we should only give the answers when ASKED.  When the way of Christianity is REQUESTED, it should be given.  It should always be there if someone wants it, but it shouldn't be forced down their throats with tales of grandeur.  It shouldn't be seen as charity.  It should be seen as a friend sharing with another upon request.  Same should be with all religeon.|`|vEobDY1haa	although Its not good to sit there and group all christians together I have to say that I agree. I too have had bad luck with  certain christian communities.

Many books were taken out and much was re-written. It is not much like the origional text used to be.<br>  <br>  Even today preachers justify things by saying things which are obviously way out in left feild to justify and reconcyle their dogma with the text of the bible. Like when Jesus was on the cross, talking to God, he was supposedly asking himself why he had forsaken himself? When he was baptised and supposedly decended on himself (as he was all three) as a dove, because he was also the Holy Ghost?  All the talk about his fathers work? I mean if those preachers are right, Jesus was one very weird and crypticall complicated dude.

Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one [of them] is missing.<br>  So who came first the Bible writers or the scientists? A circle according to the dictionary is a circumference.From space looking down from God's position,the earth is round.Astronauts proved this.Other cultures taught that the earth was sitting on the shoulders of a God.Or that the earth was sitting on the back of two elephants standing on turtles.Compare the reasoning.Isaiah talked about dynamic energy before there was any proclaimed scientists.(1 Corinthians 15:39-41) Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. 40?And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort. 41?The glory of the sun is one sort, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another; in fact, star differs from star in glory.<br>  <br>  Paul explained that one star was hotter than another before there were any scientists,he was a smart man,a lawyer ,but he couldn't have known this on his own.He explained to us the difference in animal and human life long before evoloutionists brout about their theories.<br>  So who came first the Bible or the Scientists.<br>  Too bad they don't acknowledge the great scientist who knows everything about everything.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	"He stretches out the north over empty space<br>           And hangs the earth on nothing."<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that can mean anything.

The Catholic Church will be the first to stand up and say that is wrong and against God. Statues are, though, visual aids. When we kneel before the crucifix, it is not the crucifix we are kneeling to. We are kneeling before and to God, but we use the crucifix as a way to keep our minds focused on God and Christ’s sacrifice. A person’s average attention span is only about 10 minutes and so kneeling before the crucifix helps us visualize and thus keep of focus on the Passion of Christ.<br>  <br>  Actually, a good example is that movie. I’m sure you have read the Passion of Jesus Christ in the Bible and it is moving, but that is just the facts of Jesus’ Passion, not the emotions. Watching the movie, The Passion, has such a larger affect on us because we are visual people. Seeing the suffering, the torture, the humiliation and the scandal Christ went through for love of us has such a higher impact on us because we can actually see it.<br>  <br>  It is the same way for us. Kneeling before a statue of Mary, we can focus on her willingness to bear the Savior of the world, knowing that it would end in his death. Looking upon the Pieta statue shows the anguish Mary felt while holding her dead son and that helps us focus our prayers.<br>  <br>  We do not worship that statue nor do we pray to that statue. It is a visual aid for someone who is alive and in Heaven and it is to that person we kneel before and pray to, but we only ever worship God. All worship is prayer, but not all prayer is worship. Remember that. To pray means to ask and nothing more. When we pray to a Saint, we are asking for their prayers and help, nothing more. We do not believe we can be saved by a Saint, nor do we believe that a statue has any power to save us or hear us. Again, it is a visual aid and nothing more. When I kneel before a crucifix, I know I am not kneeling to that crucifix, I am kneeling before God, I am kneeling before my Savior who suffered so horribly for the remission of my sins.<br>  <br>  When you kneel before a Christmas tree and place presents under it, are you worshiping your tree and offering sacrifices to it? No! Of course you aren’t, but someone looking through a window with no idea of what you believe may think that. When you pray before your Bible, are you praying to your Bible? No! Of course not, you are using it as an aid to help you pray and focus your mind, nothing more. Do you need a Bible to pray? No, neither do we need a statue to pray, but sometimes it helps. <br>  <br>  One of the best examples I have ever seen is from the movie “Over the Hedge”. In this movie, a raccoon is taking other forest animals around and showing them all the food people have. At one point, they’re all looking through a window at a family praying before they eat and the raccoon exclaims “And this is the alter upon which they worship the food!” Of course, this is supposed to be funny and it is, because it’s not true, but it’s a perfect example of what many Protestants do. You are looking through a window and seeing what we do and making assumptions based upon what you see and believe about Catholics, even if it isn’t what we believe or are even doing. <br>  <br>  This question has been asked many times and we have answered it many, many times. Unfortunately, many people just want to keep peeking through windows and coming up with their own conclusions. It’s not a matter of what’s true, it’s a matter of finding people who agree with you. I do hope you are truly seeking the truth and your question is not offensive in the least, but I do ask you to learn about Catholicism before you decide you know and understand what we believe. <br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	As the Tao of Atheism (poster before me)  mentioned,  this is because we don't pray to them.  <br>  <br>  VERY early on in Christianity,  this matter was largely settled by Theologians. <br>  <br>  Non-Catholic Christians who completely interpret the bible on their own, with little to no check if their interpretations are consistent with theologians and OTHER christians throughout history, don't know that this has been thought about and largely settled. <br>  <br>  The distinction is that,  1) Is the person showing respect or actually Worshipping the thing as a god?<br>  2) Is the object serving as a visiaul reminder to the person or the group to be better Christians?  Does it actually serve to direct people BACK to the one true God? -- Another wards, does seeing an image of St. Anthony,  remind me to be like him and therefore WORSHIP God better? <br>  3) Is the object a form of ART,  to make our places of worship (which could be a home,a s well as a church) more beautiful? It is natural for us to adorn what we LOVE. If we love God, it would be natural to adorn images of him and make our places of worship beautiful.  Kinda like putting on our "Sunday Best" when we go to church,  we naturally want to look good for God, if we love him and respect him.<br>  <br>  Therefore,  all of these 3 are different aspects of how a statue or image can be considered "religious art" <br>  <br>  The Bible prohibits worshipping other gods,  However, it does NOT say we can't make religious art to worship God,  the one TRUE God. <br>  <br>  Non-Catholic Christians have largely lost the connection to this teaching, to this cultural attitude towards religious art.  <br>  When they separated themselves from Catholicism, they ALSO lost a whole cultural heritage which understood the DISTINCTION between religious art and idoltry. <br>  <br>  To most non-catholic christians,  any image other then that of Jesus or God,  is idoltry.  They don't understand that we can use imaginary to FOCUS our faith.  To REMIND us.  To show RESPECT. <br>  <br>  <br>  Many of us probably have pictures of Athletes in our house or as a kid. We might have images of Rock Stars or Actors in our house as well.  <br>  We might have an image of a Car or automobile on our computers. etc. <br>  No one would ever say these are forms of "idoltry"  BUT I bet you respect those people  and I bet they sometimes "inspire" you to emulate them,  maybe to train harder, to strive for your goals, etc.<br>  <br>  Well it is largely the same with Catholics.  Images of the Pope, inspire us to follow his principles.  Images of a Saint, make us want to be more like them.  Images of Mary make us remember how she cooperated with God, and accepted her role, and became a role model for how we ALL should be.  etc. <br>  <br>  We don't worship them,  we respect them. We are inspired by them. But we don't pray to them as gods.<br>  <br>  The latin term that the Catholic church uses is "lateria" and "dulia" <br>  Non-Catholic christians don't even KNOW what these are, because they are disconnected from the Catholic church. They don't understand the difference between them.  BUT to Catholics,  there is a HUGE, insurmountable difference between them.<br>  <br>  Dulia merely means 'respect' -- that's all. Like the respect you give the President if he visited your home town. <br>  <br>  Lateria on the other hand it TOTALLY different.  Lateria is "worship"<br>  ONLY God gets Lateria.  For anything to get Lateria besides God is a GRAVE sin.  Is blasphemy.  Is heresy. Could be grounds for automatic excommunication from the Catholic faith, because that's how opposed the Catholic faith is to worship anything besides God. <br>  <br>  The Saints and Mary may get a special form of dulia, called "hyper-dulia"  - but it is NOT the same as God.|`|4sUek7ugaa	They don't worship the statues.

Where I live I have a corner where my holy pictures etc. are put on display on a little table.  Where I sit these pictures cannot be seen without turning around in my chair 160 degrees, which is uncomfortable.  Anyway, I rearanged my furniture to face my little corner.<br>  <br>  When It was hard to see everything I found myself distracted and not praying as much. They serve as visual reminders. Now my chair faces these things all is much better, I see and recall to mind much easier and without distraction.<br>  This picture I have of Jesus is not an idol. Would you consider the famous stallman head of christ picture an idol? Of corse not, Jesus is not the picture, but rather the pictures remind us of who we are loving in a very beautiful way. Who I am praying to when I look at the picture or kneel before it, is not the picture of corse, but  the who of the picture.<br>  the bible is talking about exchanging idols for the true God. Todays idols would be:  money wealth, tv, cars, power, our bodies take presidence over our souls, so the more skinny and tight they are the more they are worshipped as some kind of ideal to live for.|`|AA11440601	Have you ever saluted or taken off your hat to a flag? You do this to salute the country represented by the flag.<br>  <br>  Do you have pictures of your loved ones? Have you ever looked at the picture of someone while talking on the phone to them?<br>  <br>  Statues and pictures of people we love are not idols.<br>  <br>  Statues and paintings of Jesus and the saints are just like pictures of the people we love and respect. <br>  <br>  The King James Version of the Bible states in Exodus 20:4: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth"<br>  <br>  Why were the Jews commanded not to make graven images? Graven images were the standard method of pagan worship. They were representations of false gods.<br>  <br>  This is a very clear command. <br>  <br>  However God commanded the Jews in Exodus 25:18 and 1 Chronicles 28:18–19, "And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them" <br>  <br>  And in 1 Kings chapter 7 Solomon made bulls and other images out of precious metals.<br>  <br>  It seems obvious that the Jews did not worship the cherubims and Solomon did not worship the bulls he had made. These images did not violate the command of God. Therefore, an image not made for worship is acceptable. <br>  <br>  In Numbers 21:8-9, "And the LORD said to Moses, "Make a saraph and mount it on a pole, and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover." Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole, and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent looked at the bronze serpent, he recovered."<br>  <br>  And in John 3:14-15, Jesus says in correlation, "And just as Moses lifted up the [image of a] serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life." <br>  <br>  How can a statue of our Lord Jesus Christ dead on the cross be considered an idol to a false god? A crucifix is the message of the Gospel without words held up for all to see, a visual reminder of the sacrifice of Jesus, no different from a painting, a play, or a movie.<br>  <br>  How can a nativity set set up in your house to constantly remind you and teach your children of God's love for us be idolotry?<br>  <br>  Catholics do not worship statues but the almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	We Catholics Do NOT i repeat Do NOT pray to statues.

He used this for a teaching opportunity.  <br>  <br>  He knew the attitude of his disciples to Gentiles, so he "reflected" that attitude, giving the woman the chance to answer it, shame his disciples, and settle the issue of whether or not Gentiles could receive from God.  She gave a perfect answer, and - at least for the 12 - settled what would be a major issue in the first century church - whether Gentiles could be saved.  Note that all of the disciples would go on to be among the first to carry the message of Christ to the Gentile world.<br>  <br>  In his teachings, Jesus was smart enough to use all kinds of different types of speech and "tricks" to get his point across in a memorable way.  This is just one of many such examples where Jesus uses words to draw the truth out of another person.|`|a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	It seems to me that Jesus as portrayed in this story is something of a Jewish redneck, kind of intolerant to start with, but his divine nature or his holiness or whatever then lead him to have compassion on the woman and to reach out to her past the normal ethnic stereotypes and religious boundaries.<br>  <br>  So this shows Jesus growing in spiritual maturity and tolerance, doesn't it?  I'm an agnostic, but I think you're unfairly putting the worst spin you can on the story instead of seeing its positive side.<br>  <br>  BTW - Can some Christian scholar in here tell me whether Jewish men in the time of Jesus were even supposed to talk to strange women, especially non-Jewish women?  <br>  <br>  The liberal Christian writers I've read have all focused on how unusually open towards women, and relatively non-judgmental towards women, Jesus seems to have been for a man in his very patriarchal society.  <br>  <br>  To many pious and highly religious Jews of his generation, the fact that he'd talk to a non-Jewish woman at all probably marked him as a wild and immoral hippie.|`|8UqDCPjRaa	He was testing her faith, to see if she really believed He was her God and not just the God of the Isrealites.

Jesus therefore had disavowed himself of being a Jew and therefore was goyum or a Gentile himself, which the Jews to this day still despise and want to kill, as evidenced here in the US and the world and so offensively and barbaric in Gaza.<br>  <br>  So I would say that this story about Jesus is either a lie concocted by the Jews to discredit Jesus and Christianity, which the Jews hate and want to destroy, or Jesus was testing her faith and was going to help her regardless, Jesus was a holy man and the savior of mankind, and wasn't simply a jerk, you jerk.

The various groups are quite divergent in their beliefs and philsophical approaches. Some are oriented toward Christianity, while others look more to Egyptian mysticism, and there are other approaches, too. Try to find out which group issued the manual (Fraternitas Ros?

Incense, candles, bells, genuflection, etc. all add to the experience by involving more senses than merely eyes and ears.  The Sign of the Cross is both a prayer and a sign.  (A sign is like a symbol, except that it's something you do rather than something you have.)<br>  <br>  The prayer is a dedication, a statement that what one is doing or about to do is done in the name of God, Father, Son and Spirit. The sign is a tracing in the shape of the cross of Christ, reminding one of Christ's sacrifice and of ones call to carry ones own cross.  At times, the gesture has contained additional signs.  Some people touch head, chest and shoulders with two fingers, signifying the two natures of Christ.  Some use three fingers, signifying the Trinity.

And by this ritual we inhabit the spiritual if only for a moment.  That is the power of ritual, that it is a mystical participation with the Divine.  The rant against icons and ritual is misplaced because it is misunderstood.  Ritual is facilitation, not an end to itself.  Therein lies its power and truth.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The sign of the cross serves as a personal re-dedication to God, a reminder of our baptism, and a sign of our eternal destiny as Christians.|`|AA10181489	It is done with the prayer, "in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit," or "Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit," but usually silently.|`|sLenHdnTaa	Father son and holy spirit.

It reminds us to carry our cross daily. It reminds us of the Holy Trinity.  <br>  <br>  "The Sign of the Cross is primarily a blessing. We use it to call God's blessing upon us. We also use it, in both large and small versions, to bless others or things, such as a rosary. When used in this way,the large Sign of the Cross is made in the air. Laypersons as well as clergy can use it to bless others. Parents,for example, may use the Sign of the Cross to bless their children.<br>  <br>  When we make the Sign of the Cross upon ourselves, we are also expressing our belief in God and the Trinity. Through it, we remind ourselves of God's love for us, of the sacrifice Jesus made to give us eternal life, and of the presence of the Holy Spirit within us.<br>  <br>  The Sign of the Cross also gives us a way to express our belief in Jesus' death and our hope in the Resurrection. We embrace the cross of Jesus and express our willingness to take up our own cross, all the while bursting with joyful hope in the Resurrection."|`|QLDMmp6Taa	The cross of Christ is the crossroads of history and the central event of Scripture. Just as in the Church year Good Friday stands between Advent and Easter, so the Crucifixion stands between the Incarnation and the Resurrection.<br>  <br>  The early Christian apologist Tertullian wrote, "In all our travels and movements, in all our coming in and going out, in putting on our shoes, at the bath, at the table, in lighting our candles, in lying down, in sitting down, whatever employment occupies us, we mark our forehead with the sign of the cross."<br>  <br>  The cross is the mark of Christianity so we mark our body, which is a temple for the Lord, with the sign of the cross.

GGmaSpHDaa	Cogent explanations are available for questions about the Bible that people have.  In most cases, apparent contradictions in Biblical accounts are actually complementary perspectives.    <br>  <br>  Of course, as with any field of inquiry, some questions remain open, but in my opinion, they pale in comparison to the strength of the arguments for God’s existence. No cognitive dissonance.<br>  <br>  Most questions that new readers of the Bible have about various passages in scripture are well known and covered in a concise manner in good study Bibles. <br>  <br>  Two examples are: NIV Study Bible and ESV Study Bible. <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/cms_content?page=1960297&sp=57355&event=1003NIV|169342|57355" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/B...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=502415&netp_id=524958&event=ESRCN&item_code=WW&view=covers’" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/B...</a><br>  <br>  For detailed explanations of Biblical passages <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=26067&netp_id=276901&event=ESRCN&item_code=WW&view=covers" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/B...</a><br>  <br>  Specialized books address questions about the Bible as a whole or its message, in any depth and intellectual level you desire. www.cbd.com<br>  <br>  I would recommend a book written on a popular level to get the big picture, like one of Lee Strobel's books.

The Bible was written by a bunch of people inspired by God but they all put their own agenda in their writing.

They dove tailed many stories by different authors and so it is difficult to sort out and confusing in many places.  There was a book titled, How to read the old Testament, I think.  It is a small book but very good.  Good luck.|`|lXaAFIHfaa	Read the book The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel.It is written by a reporter trying to prove that Jesus wasn't the son of God.

P5rczL0Saa	Amen to that. JESUS is the absolute TRUTH!  <br>  Also, satan has his hand in those other religions. he is blinding them to the real TRUTH. <br>  Some claim there are many different ways to salvation, some claim God is "yourself."  And if you examine them closely, they all are about "SELF."   JESUS said to DENY YOURSELF, pick up your cross, and follow Him. <br>  <br>  Another point is that satan wants a "one world religion" that will be set up by the Antichrist and the False Prophet. All those other religions you mentioned claim to be "TOLERANT" OF ALL RELIGIONS. Nowhere in the Bible does God TOLERATE other religions. He calls them HARLOTS. You always hear them saying, "Why can't we ALL JUST GET ALONG?"   Because, Jesus said, " YOU ARE EITHER WITH ME, OR AGAINST ME."     <br>  There's only 2 ways.   JESUS or satan. <br>  Thank you for standing up for JESUS!!   God Bless|`|6aIuZZi7aa	It is apparent that you have not read the book "The Satanic Bible" by Anton LaVey in its entirety, because Satan as an archetype represents opposition to ALL religion and spirituality which suppresses human nature! In "The Satanic Bible," Anton LaVey expresses his hatred of the hypocrisy of "white" magicians, and the philosophy in Satanism, materialism and egoism, is in opposition of Buddhism. But it is undeniable that Christianity has been the most suppressing religion, as its "Christ" and "God" have caused people to believe that human nature is a "sin," deserving of condemnation or redemption!|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Most evil religion? I do beg to differ.

DiIAaFgzaa	I can't make laws that make you believe that it is wrong to steal.  I can't make laws that make you believe it's wrong to murder.  Laws simply state what is legal and the consequence for breaking said laws.  They never change the attitude of the individual toward the action, but they might cause a person to think twice before committing a crime.|`|66bb11f746dab3f91de4830e79c7f479aa	I think that most laws are based on morality, so legislating morality happens all the time, all over the world, successfully.<br>  <br>  Morality is NOT a personal thing.  Stealing, murder, and insider trading are all immoral, they all hurt others, and laws against them are good.|`|sUBA3Ecgaa	I think is true!!<br>  Because the morals and ethics of man is not made up of laws and set of rules to follow each day, but is about within ourselves that we're righteous and  decisions we make and how we interpret man-made laws! You cant discuss whats right or whats wrong because at the end it really depends on all of us! some people choose to kill others, while the law says is illegal and wrong, but others don't kill people because they understand that its wrong at every moral level!!( is hard to explain, but its an easy example)|`|AA10031161	Morality is about what's right and wrong...<br>  <br>  Laws can't really define that. Defining right and wrong can only happen within an individual's mind and heart.<br>  <br>  Case in point- Proposition 8<br>  Some feel that gay marriage is wrong.. while others feel that it's a fundamental right... and we all know how much fun that attempt has been!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	God IS Morality!!

They have all been abject failures.<br>  <br>  Morality is a personal issue (as long as it doesn't intrude on others) and no law in the world will ever make it happen.  It has to come from the individual whether to be moral.<br>  <br>  And don't forget, not everyone's morals are the same.

But what loving father sends their own children to hell? God makes us, apparently, so God is our father, NOT SATAN.<br>  <br>  The problem here isn't whether God exists or not; the true problem lies in the definition of "all-loving" that you Christians preach and babble on about.

I simply choose my own conscience.<br>  <br>  <br>  If God did exist as he is described in the Bible, he would most likely condemn me to Hell. And why?

eO2rnf7yaa	The sins of which you write might better be thought of as tendencies to engage in more sin.  They all lead people into committing more sins. That is what is so serious about them.  All sins tend to make us more likely to commit sins, unless we purposely repent and are reconciled with God. Sins such as pride, lust, gluttony and avarice are especially deadly because they tend to lead us into very serious sins,  and to do so repeatedly.  <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic and I take these sins very seriously.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	most honest people dont do them at all<br>  a few honest people get snared <br>  <br>  but i would say everyone that is religious and even the criminals who do them take them seriously. <br>  <br>  because if they get caught even according to human justice they either get capital punishment or jail.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	I think you make a good point, and I myself have been guilty of all 7. I hope I'm forgiven. I think it's an individuals interpretation don't you? lust, greed envy, vengeance, sloth, pride, gluttony.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Even though I am not a Catholic, I take these (and all) sins very seriously. I must admit that I do struggle with gluttony, which is very dangerous to me as a diabetic.|`|G49lKR56aa	O.k. let's take gluttony. It does not only mean food! In the case of the seven deadly sins, it means, too much of anything! Money, sex, food huge home, huge car, huge ego etc... <br>  So yea, everybody sins. The difference being, Christian ask for forgiveness! I'm sure you have heard this, I'm not perfect, just forgiven! This fits the seven deadly sins perfectly!<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|j0zDQQG2aa	OK, this is what I think.<br>  <br>  Lust is not a sin - People have a right to want to date other people, otherwise doing things like forcing people who want to divorce would be rape and keeping them against their will would be hostage taking.<br>  People have rights, though it is not the sort of thing you do if you respect someone because you want to stay with them.<br>  <br>  Gluttony is not a sin - You can eat as much as you want, just that if you do so, you may get ill, fat and die eventually from heart problems.<br>  <br>  Greed is often a sin but not always - If you take too much and it does not have an adverse affect on other people or animals etc, it cannot be wrong to take more than you need.<br>  <br>  Sloth is often a sin but not always - If you are lazy, it can inconvenience people, but at other times, it will only affect you not living your life.<br>  <br>  Wrath is sin in most cases - This is when there is violence and abuse, but you can use anger and channel it into determination to do something.<br>  <br>  Envy is not a sin on it's own - You are only bad if you take it out on someone else when you envy.<br>  <br>  Pride is not a sin - Pride is a good thing, just arrogance is bad.  Humility is bad but not a sin.<br>  <br>  I hope that clears things up.<br>  <br>  CREED|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	I take them seriously.  However, your perception of the seven deadly sins (SDS) and my understanding of them are a bit different.  <br>  <br>  Allow me the chance to explain the SDS to you in a different light.  There are many sins and many reasons to sin.  We can break each sin down into categories of the SDS.  Did I sin because I gave into desires to be prideful, lustful, gluttonous, angry etc. or even a combination?<br>  <br>  'Sin' is the decision to reject the will of God.  We can do this in many ways.  Those different ways are described in the SDS.   It is through them that a Christian can reject God and the Salvation he has offered to all.  In a number of ways, the SDS is a teaching tool.   Here are a few articles that go deeper:<br>  <a href="http://www.whitestonejournal.com/seven_deadly_sins/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitestonejournal.com/seven_d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2307/why-are-the-seven-deadly-sins-so-deadly" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadl...</a><br>  <br>  "I thought that if you broke them, you went to Hell?"<br>  - Not necessarily.  The faith and salvation is much more relational than your court, judge, verdict view.  While simple, 'going to hell' is different than your understanding.<br>  <br>  "Saying 'Proud to be Christan' - would that be sinning?"<br>  - No.  There is a correct amount of pride, then there is a pride that is disproportionate or in excess.<br>  <br>  Read the links to learn more.<br>  <br>  May God grant us peace.<br>  JSW|`|3lEyZnP9aa	Seriously serious.

The theory is scientifically acceptable and this rampant ignorance of evolution is wrong.

We know from the ratio of hydrogen/helium that the sun is just over 4.6 billion years old.  Mathematical models as well as astronomical evidence from other planetary systems suggest that planet formation in accretion discs is probably rapid, requiring at most 100 million years.  For our planet to begin approaching its current size may have been 4.4-4.5 billion years ago.  The Hadean stage of the early Earth featured a sometime molten landscape.  It took a while to cool and avoid being constantly bombarded by large asteroids.  The oldest rocks on Earth are 3.85 billion years old.<br>  <br>  Our moon, made from rock shed by a planetary impact of Earth, was formed 4.4 billion years ago.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	I believe the earth is no more than 6000 years old and that may be to old.

The Bible doesn't put a date on it and Science's estimates keep getting pushed back further and further into to the past, but it's dates are an unproven hypothesis based on assumptions that can't be tested.<br>  <br>  Some of the things people call “science” are really outside the realms of science because they’re not observable, testable, repeatable. The areas of conflict are beliefs about the past, not open to experimental testing. <br>  <br>  Take radioactive dating; you can measure decay rates and isotope ratios today, but you can’t extrapolate back to some time in the past when you couldn’t measure it. <br>  <br>  If radioisotope dating  is foolproof, how is it that when you test recently formed rocks of known recent age  they incorrectly date as being Millions of years old?   <br>  <br>  Why do isochron dating methods contradict single-sample radioisotope dates?   <br>  <br>  If different scientific dating methods yield different ages and there are variations with the same method, how can scientists know for sure the age of any rock or the age of the earth?   <br>  <br>  Can science absolutely guarantee that there is no chance whatsoever that nuclear decay rates might have been grossly accelerated during a past catastrophic episode or episodes?  <br>  <br>  How does science get around the problem of  excess Argon when Potassium-Argon and Argon-Argon dating Crystal Rock samples which suggests a much younger earth?<br>  <br>  Why do we find so much Helium in zircons from deep underground, when the diffusion and leakage rates of Helium are so great it should have worked it's way out millions of years ago?  <br>  <br>  Why couldn't Po radiohalos be an indication of accelerated radioactive decay in the past and/or suspension of normal geological processes and process rates?<br>  <br>  The simple answer is we just don't know how old the earth is but there are indications that it may not be anywhere near as old as science would have us believe BUT is probably somewhat older that young earth creationists would have us believe.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	42 years old.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	4.55 billion years old.

Non belief is not a burden, it allows the freedom to explore problems in a way unrestrained by preconceived ideas and rigid religious dogma. Loss and guilt? No, I have lost nothing from non belief and I have nothing to feel guilty about, no matter how much certain sections of the population may try to convince me otherwise.<br>  <br>  > Do you ever wish that someone could show you the way to a better life?<<br>  <br>  Everyone wishes for a better life at some point. However I take it that your comment defines a "better life" as a religious one in which case, no I do not. I am much happier and more content without religion than I ever was trying to force myself to believe it.<br>  <br>  You should bear in mind that atheism is not denying or casting away of a deity, it is simply non belief.

How much money is made 'in the name of god' by various preachers which goes into their own pockets rather than to help the poor and needy?<br>  <br>  The problems I face on a daily basis are things like will I have trouble getting to work on time, will my day go ok, will I run out of milk.  Just ordinary mundane things.<br>  I don't object to religion, but wish that people would keep their beliefs to themselves and stop trying to convert me.<br>  <br>  There are good people in the world and bad people in the world.  Religion does not make you good, atheism does not make you bad.
0JE41mXsaa	No.  <br>  <br>  The Orthodox Divine Services have a certain prayerful dignity where dancing, clapping or cheering would feel inappropriate.  <br>  <br>  Its a very Old Testament form of worship to dance as part of your religous observance.  Orthodox Christianity has not participated in this way from the commencement of the Early Church - at least as far as I am aware.<br>  <br>  OT Dancing in worship...<br>  2 Samuel 6:14<br>  And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.|`|K4k7mADVaa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  Be Blessed!|`|i2RxJAYeaa	They disco dance.

The church was filled with teenagers.  They would get up and do ballet in the front of the pews.  I have never seen anything like it.

I never went back.|`|LLey4VRzaa	You can get up and dance in any Church.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	If you want to, although I am a little more subdued.|`|TMb076n6aa	Check this out You Tube Joyconference.com<br>  Just one of many examples|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Why yes! Just as the patriarch David did, full of the joy of the Lord, danced before the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol of God's presence in his day. <br>  <br>  Not like ballroom dancing. But rather a spontaneous response of an individual Believer seeking to worship God with his/her whole being. Of course, all of these expressions are to be proper and in order, in a worship service that is directed by the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  So, in the same way David danced, we who have the reality of God's Spirit (and not the symbol), are privileged to worship God in this manner.<br>  <br>  2 Samuel 6:14 says: "And David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod."<br>  <br>  Psalm 149:3 says: "Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp."<br>  <br>  Psalm 150:4 says "Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs."<br>  <br>  Let's dance!<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  ~SFECU~<br>  pray4revival<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTi2wjeyyBc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTi2wjeyy...</a><br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mdcaklfw8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mdcaklf...</a>|`|AhJaRRlbaa	No way.  There is nothing wrong with dancing per se, but it would be blasphemous to do so during mass.  That is that time when we partake in Christ's suffering and the gift He gives us through the Eucharist.

Now as far as christians go, they are free to pray any time they choose and should.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Allowing mandatory prayer? That makes no sense. Is it different from forcing people to pray optionally?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	First, tell me the difference between allow mandatory prayer and mandating optional prayer !!! That is a word confusion the likes of which I haven't seen in a dog's age.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	"allow" and "mandatory" don't seem to quite go together.

What some suggest is mandatory/forced led Christian prayer imposed on all children. That is just plain arrogance.|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	Even as a Christian Pastor I would not support "mandatory" prayer in school or anywhere else for that matter. Forcing someone to pray or to acknowledge my personal beliefs is not right. However... in saying that .. at the same time I do not feel it is right to "disallow" prayer in school either. Each person should be able to make their own choice about that. If a group of Christian students want to gather around a table at school and give thanks (grace) prior to their meal they should be allowed to do so. If a child has a free period in school and is allowed to use that time as they want if they choose to read a Bible that should be allowed also. If members of the FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) wants to have prayer before a sporting event that should also be allowed...this harms no one, it is their right to worship as they see fit, not mandated from anyone. Mandatory prayers or observance is wrong, but also is restricting the freedoms of religion of an individual or group of like minded individuals from exercising their faith as they see fit to do so.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I think Ben Affleck said it best...:<br>  <br>  "What, are you f***ing RETARDED?!?!"<br>  <br>  Things that are MANDATORY are not "allowed"; they are FORCED!|`|AA11907123	Uhh...if it's mandatory you're not "allowing" it you're mandating it.|`|YfbC1m3haa	Yes, especially the ones to Zeus, Marduk, Allah, and Kukulkan.|`|dDprsKZYaa	I think you should look up the definitions of 'allow' and 'mandatory' and then get back to us.

MvZMA5BGaa	It is God and God alone that does the seeking.<br>  Not a single solitary human being seeks after God.<br>  <br>  God begins the pursuit of individual men and women.<br>  A man is to respond to God in seeking back the God he<br>  has heard from.

Leaving Christianity was a terrifying experience for me.  I didn't WANT to be an atheist.  But no amount of prayers, pleading, begging god to show himself to me changed anything.  These people that say god will answer if you open your heart to him are liars.  I was a devout Christian that earnestly tried to maintain my faith.  There was no one more sincere about it than me.<br>  <br>  There was no answer, because god is imaginary.|`|RJRantBfaa	R/L,<br>  <br>  Here's my gut level answer (from one of your favorite Christians.... lol)<br>  <br>  You know from my profile that I've called myself mystic and creative;  there is also an implied third descriptor. You want to take a guess as to what that is?<br>  <br>  Eccentric.<br>  <br>  I'm weird.<br>  <br>  I like to think I'm sensitive to people.... their emotions.... and the universe around me. Certainly not as much as I would like. <br>  <br>  In my wierdness, I've come upon ideas like, "how can the history and science of humanity possibly be an accurate representation of the rest of the infinite universe?" No one, atheist, Believer, or otherwise, has come up with answer that I can accept. Or is logical, for that matter.<br>  <br>  Our tiniest speck of dust (called "Earth") is how it is out there in the rest of the never-ending universe? No no no no no. Not only is this NOT logical, to believe this statement is gross hubris.<br>  <br>  I seek God because there is room for him/her in the universe. And I believe there is room for a Gospel of Love. Does God seek me? Yes, in that I can be a part of the Gospel of Love if I so choose. And its so that I've chosen.<br>  <br>  I ain't perfect at it, for sure. I'm not even 100% sure I'm right. But I walk in the hope that I am somehow partly right. After all, I don't know what I don't know. And to claim that I DO know what I don't know is not "weird," but delusional.<br>  <br>  Whew.<br>  <br>  Happy weekend!|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	You can say what you want to, but God knows your heart, obviously what you are saying from your lips does not match your heart...<br>  Because if there is pride in your heart, and only God knows that, He will not come to your rescue, God does not react to tears and pain that we have, He only reacts to faith, and a broken spirit...meaning that you are giving up yourself in order so that He can take over your life...|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Can I be honest with you?<br>  <br>  You say  "I was too weak and hurt to even ask for help"<br>  <br>  Do you recognize that as pride?<br>  <br>  Do you know that God resists the proud and pride must be broken in us.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	He doesn't. We have a free will. We can't answer for God. I just know that I have a desire to grow. It's not a feeling. The Holy Spirit gives me that desire based on my decision to accept truth.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Is this related to your dating diver question?  <br>  <br>  God is not a diver!!!  :P|`|UWsyqLrwaa	God is always with you even when you're going through tough times, but like your parents who help you because you love and believe in them you should do the same thing to God..God loves you more than your parent will ever do and he will help you if you open up and start to put all your trust in him..you have to love god and seek him through rough and happy times..you should thank God for giving you good parents, some of us don't have them..|`|7f65e028a9299be65138de1d8d61b165aa	This is how I see it.  God gives a test of quantum mechanics to 2nd graders.  None of them could actually pass on their own.  But the ones who pass are the ones who ask the teacher for help.<br>  <br>  Let me be honest.  i don't know why God thinks this is more fair than just passing everyone or any other way, but I trust him.|`|YIElevidaa	God is there for those with the capacity to imagine him and deny all rationality while indulging in the sanctuary of "his" love.|`|79uzTFl7aa	You just have to ask.  Even with parents you need to meet them halfway else they will know you're not serious.|`|ms0eYsD5aa	he has a ego problem|`|7utlNXpKaa	Because his love and wonderful grace is a gift, but you don't have to take it. He left that up to each of us and if we do want it we just need to ask for it and it will be given to us. When I first opened my heart to Jesus, I didn't even know if it was really opened. My heart was sooo hardened. It needed to be completely broken before I could trulely feel the awesom prescense of God. But when I did, it was like all of the air around me was thick with the Holy Spirit! Tears came out of nowhere and I finally new the purpose of life. This world is only a tiny little fraction of what life really is, we just have to get through it. Don't give up on God, invite him into your heart, ask him to allow you feel his prescence, ask him to show you that he is there for you! He will do it. Try opening the Bible, this is what I did when I first came to Christ almost 3 years ago and he spoke to me through those words. If I can be delivered from alcohol and drugs, cigarrettes, depression, and have a marriage saved that by the worlds standards would be considered unsaveable, I truley believe you will be delivered from your troubles! It just means that there is something better for you even though it doesn't feel like it right now! I will pray for you!|`|FOZGMadaaa	God wants to save us.

You're quoting PEOPLE on YA, which is NOT the same as scripture!  Christians are all reading the same book, but we aren't all reading it in the same way.  I read almost as dumb stuff from Christians as I do atheists.  So, be careful!  Don't dismiss Christianity based on some of the silliness you see here.<br>  <br>  In fact, God is not passively sitting around waiting for you to do anything!  Here is a link that explains the doctrine of predestination:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.calvinistcorner.com/predestination.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calvinistcorner.com/predestin...</a><br>  <br>  It is based upon three basic premises:<br>  <br>  1. Mankind is so terribly lost in sin that we would NEVER come to God on our own.  Every Christian is a little embarrassed to admit how much fun sin is.  You think we're going to voluntarily leave the bars and strip joints and crack houses and just out of the blue come knocking on the Lord's door?  No, no, no!<br>  <br>  2. God CHOOSES us to be saved.  It's not based on any sort of merit or anything, but God does make the choice who is saved and who isn't.<br>  <br>  3. God woos us to Christ.  They call this "an effectual call."  <br>  <br>  NO WHERE in this brief description do you find a passive God sitting around HOPING that people will come to His son.  As R.C. Sproul put it: "Do you really believe that God would have sacrificed His only son for our sins and then left it up in the air whether anyone would take the offer of salvation?"  (Pssst!  It's a rhetorical question.  The answer is no.)<br>  <br>  Now, the question on the table is ... is God coldly waiting on you to come to Him, the way some have said?  Let me tell you a quick story to try to answer this question:<br>  <br>  A friend of mine, a completely Godless woman, and her husband helped out her mother-in-law once during a bad financial crisis.  She told me about the woman's reaction later.  Sneering, my friend said: "We have just given her $5,000 and you know what she had the nerve to say?"  I asked, "What?"  "She said: 'Praise God for what He's done!  He always provides.'"  <br>  <br>  She summed up her anger this way: "We've just given this woman $5,000 and she's praising God!  WHAT ABOUT US?"  I said ... "Well, who gave you the money?  I mean, can you control whether you had that money or not?  You and your husband lost your jobs once.  You two were flat broke for more than three years!  What if she had needed the money THEN?  You wouldn't have had it, would you have?"  She looked down, sort of sheepishly.<br>  <br>  I said, "What if you didn't love her and were willing to help her?"  WHO softens people's hearts to the needs of others?"  She got the points.  Sort of.  I said, "Look, I think she should have thanked you two.  I believe sincerely that God did provide that money for her, but ... God used you two to do it.  You are to be commended for that.  But God deserves praise too!"<br>  <br>  So, did anyone help you through your bad times?  How do you know that the person saying or doing just the right thing isn't inspired by God?  Maybe He knows that you would reject Him outright if He came to you more directly, but He can help you through others.<br>  <br>  It's just food for thought!  No matter how low your lows have been, no matter how bad your bad times have been, I know that you've been blessed mightily.  Do you have your sight?  Of course you do!  Can you hear?  Of course you can!  Can you walk?  Talk?  Do you have family that loves you?  Did the sun rise for you today?  Will it set for you tonight?  Do you have your health?  Food in your belly?  Clothing on your back?  Are you married?  Do you have children?  A job?  Shelter?  I could go on and on, but you get the point.  Many of us take ALL OF THIS for granted and then say, "Where's God?"  He's there in the details, friend.<br>  <br>  He loves you.  He's showing Himself to you everyday and you're ignoring His grace and His comfort, choosing to give credit elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Lord bless.

I've know tons of "Good Christians" that lie, cheat, steal, are violent and alcoholics but think because they are "saved" none of that matters.  Morality and religion don't always come hand in hand many people use their religious beliefs to justify their own immorality, hatred and bigotry.  Non-Christian tend to dislike the people who are "holier than thou" and try to shove their personal beliefs down others throats.  If you are a genuinely good person and also happen to be Christian most people won't have a problem with you, but as the tone of your question seems to indicate you are of the "holier than thou" type that could be your problem.|`|41db5b486612d71aef27d2e88a94662caa	it's because you guys wear belts with short pants.<br>  I simply can't respect that.|`|LF4vun1maa	I just answered this one.<br>  <br>  It's because you're wrong on the internet.<br>  <br>  But also being told I won't believe someone's lies because I'm afraid of the truth is very frustrating.<br>  <br>  See, all this talk about light and righteousness in your post?

I don't dislike christians, that's your path, and i respect it. But let me set you straight. Most pagans DO have morals. They don't steal, cheat, or anything 'evil'. And I know more than my fair share of christians that do all of the above. The reason most pagans don't like christians is because they run into jerks like you, who want to insult them and shove christianity down their throat and try to tell them that their religion is evil. in case you didn't know, many pagans follow this one rule: 'an it harms none, do what you will. Also, we have a sort of 'karmic' law, so basically we believe that if we do something to harm another person, it's gonna bite us in the butt. so maybe read up on paganism before you decide to insult us, mmkay?|`|MTuUZBzIaa	I don't get drunk, I don't go to parties, I don't steal from my neighbors, I do have a little of the sex from time to time sure we all do, and I never cheat on a woman I love.<br>  <br>  I live with honor, and I expect for you to not judge me and mine like this.

If you are suggesting that non-Christians are immoral, give it up. Christianity and morality are two different things, and one can be highly moral without being Christian (or religious at all).

Go god!<br>  <br>  Ok, as an adult, try a little self control if you want to remain abstinent. If you can't stop having sex, use a condom or other birth control measures to prevent pregnancy. There are no magic pills or programs that will keep you celibate. It's all about personal discipline. I'm sure if you found a 12-step like sponsor to call on when you feel weak would be helpful.

The yelling and arguing  heard in all the lower class area?  The slum look of many of the cities.

Socrates, Plato, Sir Isaac Newton, Shakespeare), or are you blinded by your arrogance?<br>  <br>  AND by the way, your precious romans are not so great as you regard them as, considering they took a lot from the GREEKS. They are an amazing culture who had Alexander the Great among others; introduce one of the democratic governments.

It STOLE technology from them. The majority of its art, technology, and literature were inspired by Greece. However, just as much of Rome's technology was home grown, but the engineers were schooled in Greece, once again. 2) Attractive people come from ALL ethnic groups. But I dare say that American women are considered to be the most attractive on Earth, due to our superior nutrition. I am partial to Oriental and Latina girls myself. 3) Be wary of being too proud of your heritage though. For every good thing any culture or civilization ever did, it committed an atrocity to over shadow it. <br>  Even though I am proud of my Nordic roots, the thought of the Nazi murdering of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust saddens me immensely.<br>  By the way, most of the scientists and engineers who put the US into space and on the moon, are of either German, Russian or Oriental descent. There are very few Italians at NASA. Also, Japan produces the best cars in the world.<br>  American music is the most popular music. Especially, music with an African influence. That includes jazz, rock, rap, hip hop, etc. It's popular even in ITALY! <br>  As far as fine cuisine is concerned, yes, Italian food is outstanding. But I think Mexican Food is better.<br>  One very last thing. You mentioned of course that you are of ITALIAN descent.

zKOZ8Gafaa	I know the answer.  Since God speaks about giving Christians a "purpose" and that purpose is the give life to the unbelievers (life meaning everlasting life), Christians care enough to love their fellow man to want them to share in an eternity without damnation.  Trying to convert you is an act of love meant for your salvation.

I know from experience that after I studied the bible, it just made too much sense for it not to be the truth, of course there is going to be a lot of things that are not going to make sense to us, but that is the reason I know for sure that it is God. We cannot bring God down to our level. There's no way. We have put a man on the moon. and we only use about two or three percent of our brain, can you imagine if we could use one hundred percent like God does? Wow what we could do. Anyway I respect your beliefs and you have a great evening.|`|eL3jebRzaa	God has sent christians into the world to help save those who don't know him. He wants everyone to be saved, thats why God has sent us to help convert people, to show them the light. God wants everyone to go to heaven, but that can't happen unless we speak out and tell others about him. We're doing what the Lord has called us to do. He loves us and needs us to follow him.|`|gTA1hmYKaa	Athiest people are living like animals.  this is no insult,  becuase they believe they are in this world without a purpose.  i met athiests that believe that they can do everything such as various crimes because they think no one is watching them and that they will get away with it.  <br>  <br>  i am shocked when people say there is no scientific evidence to sugges that there is a god.  HELLO.  look at the things around you from the cells inside your body to the planets in the universe.  e.g. if you see a toy then you will immediatly know that there was a creator.  is it possible that all the things arounds you, doesnt have a creator?<br>  <br>  wake up before its too late.  life is too short.|`|vciEtUcPaa	Because first of all the Bible says that the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,therefore it's the love and compassion of God that compels us to try to reach others with the good news of Jesus.We realize that there is a life after physical death and what we decide while living on this earth determines our destination,heaven or hell.Regardless of how nasty people are out there,we don't want them to go to hell.The reward we get for doing so doesn't influence us to the point where getting the reward is all we're concerned about.It's the lives of countless millions that are heading to a place of inhuman torment that lasts forever.Even if you atheists knew that something like that existed,you'd do all in your power to prevent people from going there!|`|OuaTRZXraa	not all Christians.  These are radical, in your face Christian.  I am a Christian and do not do this to people.  I dont think athiests are going to hell either.  I'm not the judge.  To these Christians you might say to them that it is ones like them who have scared you away from the faith.  They'll think twice next time, promise.|`|MFcSwTFpaa	They do it to reinforce their delusion.  They think that if you can convince someone, it somehow makes your beliefs stronger.  I'm sure the fundies have some religious explanation like, god tells us to," or something.  Faith is finally on its way out of American life.  It's getting so difficult to get converts that they are left with the morons.|`|a4fec9ef194ad0c800457a3bf99c262baa	Christians are ordained by the Lord to preach the word.Lets just say your best friend was about to commit suicide, you would do all you could to save him/her. Well its rather like that for us we know the truth we experience the truth in our daily lives so yes we have to do the Lords work. If we didn`t on the day of judgement we would have a lot of explaining to do. Look Jesus loves you come step into the light and except him as your Lord and saviour today.|`|c9xy59Ymaa	I don't, but I know, a lot of other Christians do. People should be whatever religion they want to be. I don't pity or hate atheists, I don't think they're going to hell either as long as they're good people.|`|xmy94psMaa	Because trying to convince other people helps them forget about their own doubts and because they don't believe differing opinions are a good thing.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Pity is a manifestation of pride, which is separation from g-d.|`|7bgg4jgJaa	The more people they have, the less delusional they feel, since others believe in the same thing they do.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Because of love|`|LHcdLTOxaa	not ''all'' Christians convert people.

Ha, ha. Ironic, huh?|`|SBL1t3ZSaa	People can be very cruel and mean and most if not all Christians just refuse to believe that there are many paths to God, not just one path, "their path". I don't mean that in a nasty way I truly believe it.<br>  <br>  In my opinion they are so brain washed by their religious beliefs they are on a mission to preach the good news of salvation and they are trying to convert everyone else to their faith and beliefs.<br>  <br>  I have always felt that everyone is entitled to believe or not believe what ever they feel is right for them, and no one should judge someone for what they believe or don't believe, If people would just live and let live the world would be a much better place to live in.<br>  <br>  Religion has been the cause of more blood shed in the history of the world than anything else, and sadly I don't see it stopping.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Babby envy.|`|3EudCWEuaa	If you really think about it, it is because they care for your well being.<br>  <br>  I would take it as a compliment. It may even surprise you that they include you in their prayers at night, or wish well for you.<br>  <br>  I know some have a bad way of trying to "convert" people, but deep down they just want happiness in eternity for you. Kinda nice of them really.<br>  <br>  Plus you have to remember that people like to get others to believe and do the things they want to do. That is why there is such a thing as "peer pressure." Friends do something, and don't want to be alone, so they convince their friends to do it also.|`|AA12079397	They think it's their great service to God. I think they get more money through several sources. They can use them for the welfare of poor and handicapped. I think they are doing it already but if they stop this unnecessary propaganda they can help more people and they can get more grace of good spirits and God. The people who work for money can tell people only what is said to them by their superiors. If the said things don't have proper sense and intelligence then they are making this propaganda not to spread their sacred principles but to destroy themselves and religion and belief in God too. They must change and proceed in the path of sense and intelligence.|`|AA11586837	Because Human Beings Who Have Asked "Jesus" to "Save Them",  Start Becomning "Like Jesus" and JESUS WANTS TO "SAVE"---EveryBody.<br>  <br>  So There.<br>  Yes, Jesus Wants to SAVE ALL HUMAN BEINGS---and satan Wants to: "Damn Them".<br>  <br>  So there.<br>  Accept Jesus as YOUR SAVIOUR---and Then!, Tell satan to: Go To Hell, for Good and For Ever<br>  <br>  Jesus LOVES---"You"!!!

8rbQBaIeaa	Hahahaha....I'm a Christian and I haven't either. I don't have signs coming at me...wish I did tho. It would make having faith a lot easier during hard times. But, faith is what we live by, the bible is our concord and the road has been laid out. We decide which road we want to take and go for it.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Many people mis-interpret certain events as "signs" even though there are other, more realistic and mundane explanations for those events. Why? Because they want desperately to believe that god is communicating with them in some way. The fact that you don't see these events as signs only means that you're a bit more rational in your approach to the world than they are. That's also probably what makes you an agnostic.|`|MEny7pBHaa	because faith is not born from a sign. if a sign is what saves you then a sign will have to keep you and sustain you... and people are prone to be fickle, wandering like sheep. you'll see something amazing and say it is amazing and then live the rest of your life looking for something more amazing. there is nothing more amazing than walking the path of righteousness without ever seeing where you plant your foot. we walk by faith. not sight.<br>  <br>  <br>  the Lord would absolutely love to divulge miraculous things before your eyes and in your heart, but if you are an agnostic, you do not belong to Him. what business does a stranger have in a servant's affairs? why should you come into the house of God and be allotted deep mysteries and profound gems of knowledge and understanding? God does not throw His treasures to the swine. you want to see a sign? wash yourself in the blood, lean upon the Lord by faith, and die with Him in baptism. only those who are born from heaven can peer into it.|`|pbabXHd2aa	Faith is a gift from God. Ask God for the gift. Ask God to believe in his Son, Jesus Christ. Try to believe in Christ and the power of baptism. Take care.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	Happy or blessed are those who believe and not need to see.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	If you seek God, you will find God.<br>  C.S.

dc0a07ce34883d4af43a326a660d000aaa	If you wanted an accurate answer to this question, you would not limit yourself to a specific collection of ancient literature in seeking the answer.<br>  <br>  The bible says that deceased folks go to another realm, Heaven, and they do not stay near us.  Some mystical philosophies say that there can be 'lost souls' that 'live' in limbo between being earth-bound and being in Heaven (these are the 'ghosts' that haunt certain locations).<br>  <br>  In reality, once a person has died and his brain ceases to function, he does not 'exist' anywhere other than in your memories and dreams.|`|AA12194228	I don't know, there were a couple of things that happened after my husband died that made me think so.

It is very sad for a person to be alone, Maybe it was an easy passing for him. God Bless him and you too.|`|4uike3ARaa	For me, when a person passes on, all that is good within that person returns to the Creator. What is evil stays behind, usually hovering near the body. This explains chindi, or evil spirits.<br>  It is not good to say the name of a dead person, as this will attract the attention of the evil spirits.<br>  Do I really, really believe this? No, but it gives me comfort to conform to cultural norms. <br>  Better than a talking, burning bush, anyway. :-)

Like destroy and remake then preserve and destroy again to make a better one?<br>  And since we, believers, believe without doubt that God "created" us for His purpose, we do not question what he did to those people you think He murdered in the Bible. You can compare them to your creation that has quality defects.<br>  Just as it is commonly practiced by quality inspectors of imported items in the world who have the authority to declare a product defective, he also have the power to declare everything as unacceptable even by just seeing the first product as unfit.<br>  As for murder among humans, whether there is or there is no God, each has the right to protect himself from being killed therefore the common concept is to prevent each other from destroying one another without valid reasons.|`|71afbaedac2a285cf2c6b5606a092e32aa	Because Allah (SWT) doesn't murder, no matter what name you give him.

I believe that mabe you don't understand the Bible completely. You see, During the Old Testament things where very very tough. It was tougher to find salvation, and there where constant battles taking place. After Christ died for our sins, everything totally changed. Anyone, both Jew and Gentile could obtain salvation. Animal sacrifices where no longer needed. ect. But during the medival period you had some hypocrites who went around killing people who where thought to be "Witches". Even though most of them probably where not to say the least. The bottom line is: Jesus Christ gave man kind new hope. Anyone can find salvation if they want it. We no longer have to stone people to death for committing adultery. ect.|`|LF4vun1maa	Empathy.

Despite what christians may try to tell you, the secret of living on this earth is not that hard to figure out I'm about to tell you the secret and meaning of life, and why killing is wrong, even outside of religion....ready?<br>  <br>  The meaning and purpose of life is to NOT DIE for as long as you can. Anything after that doesn't matter. People want to live, because nobody wants to die. That's it. Deep as it gets.|`|RFLibWncaa	Perhaps it has something to do with your brain. On an instinctual level, even if there were no laws against murder you are probably aware that if you went out and murdered someone that the community would hunt you down and kill you. Self preservation perhaps? Past that, we have empathy and we know that it isn't polite to take things from people that don't belong to us (like they're life).|`|WYk0zYdhaa	Good question...

But I also hope that I'm doing it for self-expression and also to help people with their struggles.  So, when I get thumbs down on some of my answers, I try to remind myself that not everyone is going to agree with me and that's OK.  I have a right to my opinion even if everyone else in the world disagrees with it and others have that same prerogative.  And that self expression and being true to myself is sometimes more important than giving a popular answer.<br>  A lot of times, you can kind of see what the asker is looking for when they write the question.  Like they don't want the truth, just affirmation for their beliefs.

For one thing, Jehovah's Witnesses are a world-wide organized effort to preach the good news of God's kingdom to all who live in any country.<br>  <br>  In some languages, THERE IS NO NWT BIBLE. So we use what is common to that language.<br>  <br>  We have nothing to do with the occult. That is the farthest thing from true. When we go into parts of Africa, and Central and South America, where the occult is more commonly followed or dabbled in, we teach others that to do so is not according to the Bible. We show them that Deuteronomy chapter 18 says such practices are "detestible" before Jehovah.<br>  <br>  We abide by the Bible. We love our families, we love our neighbors.<br>  <br>  We know that one of the many promises and teachings of the Bible are Jesus' words, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth". Most churches teach that the earth is not going to be a future home for righteous mankind. But Jesus did. There are so MANY scriptures that talk about a paradise for the righteous. But this is just totally dismissed by the churches as "fantasy" or a "lie". <br>  <br>  Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers - 2nd Corinthians 4:4. He wants people to miss out on this wonderful opportunity that the sacrifice of Christ made available for all mankind.<br>  <br>  We want all our neighbors to know what is in the Bible that may have been overlooked in their churches' teachings, so we go door to door sharing what we have found.

So if you are a murderer, rapist, felon, bank robber, gangbanger, drug dealer, car jacker, drug addict, philanderer, fornicator, or masturbator then Jehova's Witness is the place for you.

Generally, they both teach that God is the Creator of everything, as opposed to naturalistic evolution, and they both share the belief that Jesus Christ will ultimately return to earth to destroy Satan and establish God's eternal kingdom. However, this is where the general similarities cease. There are many important differences in doctrine between the Jehovah's Witnesses and evangelical Christianity, most important of which is the person and nature of Jesus Christ. The deity of Christ is the central point of the entire Bible. Scripture clearly teaches that Jesus Christ is God. The Jehovah Witness teachings concerning Jesus Christ clearly contradict the teachings of the Bible. Multiple passages tell us that Jesus Christ, who existed as God, took the bodily form of a humble servant so that He could die on the cross in our place. <br>  <br>  Jehovah Witness doctrine considers the 66 books of The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT) as the only true and divinely inspired Word of God. The NWT is produced and published by an "anonymous" translation committee of the WBTS. The NWT is regarded as the best and only translation of the Bible, because "the translators held so closely to what is in the original Bible languages." In addition, the "governing body" of the WBTS is regarded as God's only true channel of accurate biblical interpretation. As such, Jehovah Witness doctrine requires that we be "associated with God's channel, his organization" in order to be true followers of God. This means that there is no salvation apart from the WBTS. Christian doctrine holds that the Bible is indeed composed of the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, and is indeed the inspired and infallible Word of God. However, the NWT is not a legitimate translation, and merely reflects Jehovah Witness theology, especially its bias against the deity of Jesus Christ and the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. For example, John 1:1 in the NWT reads, "and the Word [Jesus] was a god." All other legitimate Bible translations say, "and the Word [Jesus] was God."|`|2BBKHggeaa	A witness for God (the Creator of the Universe) whose name is Jehovah ( Ps 83:18)<br>  <br>  Please visit the official site for Jehovah's Witnesses for more detail.<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks,...I hope this helped.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	I am not a hundred percent sure but who cares?They don`t have the true faith so they will burn in Hell for ever.Simple as that.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14.

LjsRfaskaa	Because the ignorant are gullible. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks .|`|VYLEfiSTaa	“I have spoken to the world publicly. . . . I spoke nothing in secret.”—JOHN 18:20.<br>  <br>  However, there is a fascinating, intriguing secret that Jehovah has revealed in his Word. It is called “the sacred secret of [God’s] will.” (Ephesians 1:9) Learning about it can do more than satisfy your curiosity. Knowledge of this secret can lead to salvation and can provide you with a glimpse into Jehovah’s unfathomable wisdom.<br>  <br>  Revealed Progressively<br>  <br>   When Adam and Eve sinned, it may have appeared that Jehovah’s purpose to have an earthly paradise inhabited by perfect humans had been thwarted. But God immediately addressed the problem. He said: “I shall put enmity between you [the serpent] and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”—Genesis 3:15.<br>  <br>  <br>  These were puzzling, cryptic words. Who was this woman? Who was the serpent? Who was the “seed” that would bruise the serpent’s head? Adam and Eve could only guess. Still, God’s words provided hope for any faithful offspring of that unfaithful pair. Righteousness would triumph. Jehovah’s purpose would be realized. But how? Ah, that was a mystery! The Bible calls it “God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom.”—1?Corinthians 2:7.<br>  <br>  As the “Revealer of secrets,” Jehovah would eventually unveil pertinent details regarding the outworking of this secret. (Daniel 2:28) But he would do so gradually, progressively. To illustrate, we might think of the way a loving father responds when his little boy asks, “Dad, where did I come from?” A wise father provides only as much information as that little boy can grasp. As the boy gets older, the father tells him more. In a similar way, Jehovah determines when his people are ready for revelations of his will and purpose.—Proverbs 4:18; Daniel 12:4.<br>  <br>   How did Jehovah make such revelations? He used a series of covenants, or contracts, to reveal much. Likely, you have at one time or another entered into some sort of a contract—perhaps to buy a home or to borrow or lend money. Such a contract provided a legal guarantee that the terms agreed upon would be fulfilled. But why would Jehovah need to make formal covenants, or contracts, with humans? Surely, his word is a sufficient guarantee of his promises. That is true, and yet, on a number of occasions, God has kindly backed his word with legal contracts. These ironclad agreements give us imperfect humans an even more solid basis for confidence in the promises of Jehovah.—Hebrews 6:16-18.|`|m6PnfBvOaa	Dumb question.
XagdEMnraa	Depends on how you interpret religious teachings and what religion you follow. There are religions that teach the existence of a god but not the existence of a devil.<br>  Even if the holy book of a religion talks of a devil that does not nessisarily have to mean that a devil exists if you follow that religion. The 'devil' may just be a metaphoric personification of evil that exists in humans and not a man that lives in hell.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Just because you believe in something doesn't make it real...(kind of like Republicans who perpetuate a lie and seem to think that if they say it enough times it'll magically become true.|`|si3eq11haa	definitely. and the devil hates God and he hates us too.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	The devil is definitely real.|`|v80N4JB0aa	only the christians believe that Satan is a actual God|`|LUiiAlsJaa	the devil is a christian god only|`|Fyb9UTSUaa	Bet he lives in Peckham.|`|uzIiaT4oaa	Im afraid so.|`|eL3jebRzaa	Yes, you can't have a good without an evil. The Devil is here because he turned against God. If Satan wasn't real then everyone would go to heaven, even if they didn't believe in God, and thats not right. We have to except God into our hearts to go to heaven, and some people may not choose the right path in life.|`|Nxolwd5Baa	i think its why many people dont like to believe in god, cos if you do then you also have to believe in satan and demons and goblins and trolls etc, me, personally i live a 3rd of my life in a world where they all exist, luckily im the boss tho' (its my dream world of course, and in there, im God)|`|NnzSeFhbaa	In the Bible, it stated that Satan was God's #1 angle. Then Satan thought he was more powerful then God so God casted him out of Heaven. Because of this, Satan was angry, and he made Hell. Unfortunately, still to this day he roams the Earth making people sin o get back at God.|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	Believing in God is of little consequence.<br>  <br>  The Devil also believes but trembles.<br>  <br>  Whether you believe God is the vital question of eternal consequence.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Christians invented the devil just as they have invented god so the only way you can believe the devil is real is to be a christian|`|3LSYhYs7aa	No, God can exist without the Devil.|`|nq2LWqoKaa	Yes the devil is real.

God warns us about the devil.<br>  <br>  All those who do not know God and have a right relationship with Him are the children of the devil. <br>  <br>  He is very real and he is out to get many for himself even if he has to lie and deceive to get his way.<br>  <br>  Beware of him, but fear Him who has complete control over our lives, namely the Lord Jesus Christ. Turn to Him today and be saved.|`|AA11225089	Yes the devil is real. You believe in God, you should trust his word, and the Bible says the devil is real. The state of the world should confirm this, and I think it does. The evil in the world cannot come from God.|`|CNJyyYIpaa	Yes. The Devil aka Lucifer was originally an angel. He got greedy and wanted to be like God. God told him to stfu and made him go to hell. <br>  There is no good without the bad.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes he is.
dmCAiuMGaa	It guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  (But I guess someone's pursuit of happiness overrules someone else's life.)|`|GHdscZ2Haa	The declaration of independence has no legal status.<br>  <br>  The laws are determined by the constitution.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ignoring that for a minute, the declaration talks about men.  Not about zygotes.<br>  <br>  It also talks about liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  If there is no age restriction, then children are legally able to take action against their parents for grounding them (restriction of liberty) or punishing them (interfering with pursuit of happiness).<br>  <br>  You really have a pathetic argument here.  You are twisting the words and meaning of a document that has no legal binding.|`|PDJjy0bPaa	*sigh*|`|oC0HfFm1aa	Pity the Declaration of Independence has no legal power in the U.S.|`|buly56vFaa	Wow, it REALLY bothers you that you can't control what women do, doesn't it?|`|5AbCtkWFaa	Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Liberty and choice are not synonymous, but I have the freedom to decide whether or not I have a kid.  That is what you're asking about, right?  You care more about zygotes than about the women carrying them or the resultant kid, right?<br>  <br>  What's your damage, honey?  Did someone drop you on your head as a child?<br>  <br>  And since "babies" is plural, it should not be preceded by the pronoun "a."  You mean "baby's," don't you?|`|6UEK1TPaaa	The Declaration of Independence guarantees nothing.  It is not a law.  It was drawn up as an indictment against the British Crown for having violated principles upon which Deists and Calvinists were able to reach an agreement.  It is simply a DECLARATORY statement that:<br>  <br>  1.  Because we deem these principles to be inalienable...<br>  2.  Because the British Government has violated these principles...<br>  3.  We have a right/duty to throw off the previously mentioned government.  <br>  <br>  It really says nothing more than that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Soli Deo Gloria|`|uK3tkaOJaa	You also don't seem to be able to remember what the "Constitution" is.|`|cSCK1sq5aa	Uhh was abortion invented yet back then? Wrong document btw.|`|37LKDbtsaa	It guarantees freedom. Including freedom from theocratic laws.<br>  <br>  Is your dick that small, that you need full control over women, in order to feel manly?
dFBccLExaa	I have always wondered that. The closest thing I've seen to a sex area is Women's Health or Men's Health, but I love the suggested category. <br>  <br>  But yeah, they should have a sex section. I wish they would. God knows I'd be there fairly often if there was one. Lol.<br>  <br>  And I've had "fun" with a woman before... so I guess my answer would be yes. Best strap on=the feeldoe.. in case you're wondering lol.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Maybe they just figure that if you're having sexual problems, you'll go to the Women's Health or Men's Health section...and if it's psychologically-related, you'll go to the Mental Health section.<br>  <br>  They've also got the section for Singles & Dating...which we know usually involves sex...and the Marriage & Divorce section...which we know usually doesn't involve sex, but whatever.  ;-)|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	All of a sudden my lifelong loathing of homework has evaporated.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	I find sex in the Etiquette section.

Try posting your question there.|`|MTuUZBzIaa	I completely agree, but you have to remember how those fundies feel, if a child sees some ones arm get ripped from their body and then be beaten to death with that arm the kid will be fine, but if the same kid reads a question about masturbation, why it's clock tower and deer rifle time|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Maybe the "Singles & Dating" section?<br>  <br>  Or maybe going over to the "Adults Only" section of AnswerBag.com?|`|T588vfJDaa	Yeah I know I tried asking some stuff in women's health (totally politely) but got deleted, that's why I'm on my fifth account now|`|YIAZmSW7aa	You of all people are just now noticing this?|`|i2RxJAYeaa	Because this is the masturbation section. <br>  <br>  DUHHHH.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	WTF You mean that the S in R&S doesn't stand for sex? Now it is starting to make sense to me why there are so many fundies here?|`|Lm3JBhfzaa	There really should be a sex section.|`|EOQ03aAeaa	There is a wrestling section.<br>  Unless you mean my sex life, which would belong in mythology.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	im thinking you could sell that sh8t on the internet and men would pay to watch<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: holy sh8t this is awesome!|`|buly56vFaa	I agree.

Oh my goodness!|`|iBcqLtT3aa	Maybe we should raid the Cleaning & Laundry section.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Probably because they think people would just post porn in there.<br>  <br>  You could try the health section. Sometimes girls post about sex and masturbation in Women's Health.|`|6DQSkKgWaa	Hi Phoenix,<br>  <br>  I know.  It makes  no sense not to have that category, since it is something that people wonder about and have questions about all the time.<br>  <br>  I guess the Health section would be the next best choice.<br>  <br>  LOL I like Ruby's answer!|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	Reported. *jk*<br>  <br>  Prolly because even safe questions would get deleted as fast as they could be written. <br>  <br>  Besides, do you think the Yamster really wants an open forum answering questions about sexuality when there is no way to confirm the poster's age?|`|UWKF7x4faa	The Yahoo categorization system is a mess.  Maybe singles and dating.<br>  Or just ask your friends here in this forum, spiritually speaking of course.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	I'd suggest Women's health.
AA11225089	I follow Jesus, it's faith not religion|`|cl4wdRnvaa	This is how I would describe my personal beliefs:<br>  <br>  I'm a Deist/Pantheist. I believe the consciousness of the entire universe is God. I believe God created the Big Bang by knowing it's on consciousness. [ "I think, therefore I am" -Descartes]. I believe all living things have a soul and collectively make up the mind of God. I believe in Karma and Reincarnation. I think of God as the underlying laws and rules of the universe. I see God at the quantum level of all laws. God to me is a Physicist, Geneticist and Mathematician. An ancient book doesn't tell me what to believe. As Science uncovers the laws of the Universe, we uncover God. I also go to science first, since I majored in Anthropology and have a B.A. in it.<br>  <br>  My principals:<br>  1. I can't interfere with the free will of others.<br>  2. I can't withhold knowledge from anyone.<br>  3.

They think this is an exclusively christian discussion forum, when in reality, it is an open question and answer forum on the topic of religion and spirituality.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to educate them on this difference, as it is hard to teach them about reality in general, as they think their faith-based beliefs is reality.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	They have an innate drive to convert people.

They never believe in the trinity until someone teaches them about the mystery. That's because the word or teaching is not bible-based.|`|5pB2QAPUaa	No, never. This is what experts say:<br>  <br>  The New Encyclopedia Britannica observes: "Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament."<br>  <br>  A Short History of Christian Doctrine states: "As far as the New Testament is concerned, one does not find in it an actual doctrine of the Trinity."<br>  <br>  The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology similarly states: "The New Testament does not contain the developed doctrine of the Trinity. 'The Bible lacks the express declaration that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are of equal essence' said Protestant theologian Karl Barth."<br>  <br>   The book Origin and Evolution of Religion says"To Jesus and Paul the doctrine of the trinity was apparently unknown; . . . they say nothing about it.".|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	When I was a child, my mother who had no religious affiliation while she was young, use to tell me that there were many who will try to convince me that God, Christ and the Holy Ghost were the same person and not to believe them.<br>  So as a rebellious teenager...I read the bible trying to prove that they were the same person as taught in Christendom churches...and I never found any scriptures that would indicate that God, Christ and the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit were the same thing.<br>  Instead, what I did read was that God has a name, Jehovah, and a son, Jesus Christ who has the same purpose, same desires, but were parent and child.<br>  The parent teaches and works along side of the child and when the child becomes and adult, said child is a skilled and qualified worker, competent, as well as 'like minded' in beliefs, practices, habits and actions.<br>  Thus Jehovah and Jesus are 2 different individuals with one purpose, to sanctify Jehovah's Holy Name and to bring to ruin, those ruining the earth and to restore a faithful mankind to perfection, while mankind restores the earth to a paradise.  And God's Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost will accomplish that purpose.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	In the Bible when Jesus teaches us almost every time he mentions the Father he gives all credit to him there are dozens of scriptures.Have you noticed they only use 1 scripture John 1:1? It say that the word was God of course because Jesus is a God.Isaiah 9:6 tells us that as Jehovah's people we understand this clearly.He is a God but not God Almighty <br>  Almighty according to the dictionary means<br>  Able to do all things,omnipotent<br>  Mighty means Possessed of might or powerful.<br>  <br>  But not powerful enough to do all things,that is why Jesus called out and relied on his Father for help,he was humble and knew his limitations. He asked for help when resurrecting Lazurus He asked for help in his prayer in the garden before he died.<br>  Nowhere in the Bible does it speak of Jesus as almighty God.<br>  (Genesis 17:1) When A′bram got to be ninety-nine years old, then Jehovah appeared to A′bram and said to him: “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and prove yourself faultless.<br>  <br>  (Luke 1:31-32) and, look! you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus. 32?This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father,<br>  <br>  Who is the most high God?<br>  (Psalm 83:18) That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.<br>  The word alone here is used to emphasize that.If people do not want to open their eyes and see the truth we cannot help them.<br>  <br>  The Encyclop?dia Britannica relates: “Constantine himself presided, at Nicaea actively guiding the discussions, about the trinity and personally proposed .?.?. the crucial formula expressing the relation of Christ to God in the creed issued by the council, ‘of one substance with the Father’ .?.?. Overawed by the emperor, the bishops, with two exceptions only, signed the creed, many of them much against their inclination.”<br>  <br>   Constantine’s role was crucial. After two months of furious religious debate, this pagan politician intervened and decided in favor of those who said that Jesus was God. But why? Certainly not because of any Biblical conviction. “Constantine had basically no understanding whatsoever of the questions that were being asked in Greek theology,” says A?Short History of Christian Doctrine. What he did understand was that religious division was a threat to his empire, and he wanted to solidify his domain.<br>  <br>  Constantine was not a Christian. Supposedly, he converted later in life, but he was not baptized until he lay dying. Regarding him, Henry Chadwick says in The Early Church: “Constantine, like his father, worshipped the Unconquered Sun; .?.?. his conversion should not be interpreted as an inward experience of grace .?.?. It was a military matter. <br>  <br>  People need to know who they are following are the following men or Jesus Christ?<br>  This pagan Emperor used his power to force the Catholic Bishops to sign (300 of them <br>  from Nicaea) against their will because he knew that religion was a threat to his empire.|`|332vXA6oaa	No, the Trinity belief was passed on from the Catholic Church to the religions that belief in the Trinity.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	The average person has no idea what the Bible teaches.  Even highly educated people have no clue.  Unless a person is guided by Holy Spirit they will not even know what it teaches.  Most people are led to believe what their priests or ministers teach them.  You have to be honest, humble and hungry for the truth in order to see the truth in the Bible. As the Bible says in Matthew 7:13, 14 few people will gain eternal life.  That is because they worship God by practicing the traditions taught to them from their parents or clergy.  Not by what the Bible says.  They are fat, dumb and happy.  They are not interestd enough in God to find the truth. They put making a living and having creature comforts above worship of God.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	If they were open to the leading of God through The Holy Spirit(even if they were not consciously aware of being open to God) they would find what God has there for them...

However, I also think that the person would be very confused about the exact nature of Jesus, as it appears clearly in some passages that he *is* God, and in other passages that he is *pleading* with God.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of trinity is not the kind of something that comes to you after a single reading.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) or would he believe jesus is gods son, and not the same person?<br>  <br>  Well, guess what the doctrine of trinity says:  it says that Jesus is God's son, and not the same person.<br>  <br>  So, yes, they would believe that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	They will not believe nothing.

If legislation rules abortion illegal because it is the taking of life then the punishment should be the same as taking any life.

In most abortions it should be 1st degree premeditated murder.

bfWcfCKXaa	Exactly! If God wanted us to know him, why all the lack of proof? Why not just have the knowledge of our creator implanted in our genes? If the Christian or Muslim say, "well, God wants us to love him willingly," my response is: Fine! Let him show himself to everyone all around the world rather than to one prophet. Then we can all decide whether we like him or not. He can just as well speak and reveal himself to me directly through an angel and everyone else as he does to "prophets"! This whole "prophet" nonsense I never understood. Either God wants me personally to do something or he doesn't. If he does, he will just tell me himself! Prophet Horton never heard a "Who"!

But religion in itself is not true. The love of God. The God of Love, is true. Gods love can be felt like the warmth of sunlight upon your skin. Like a heavenly embrace. Like a word of encouragement. Like a tender kiss of approval from a loved one. Like loving correction to keep you from harm. The love of Christ, the sacrifices he made for us because he loved us so deeply... The desire of the heavenly father to have intimacy with us.. all create warm feelings of Joy and a desire to grow close and please ones maker. In the circles that I find myself, religion in itself is not the important thing. It is the relationship. The time we spend in intimacy with our creator and the love that we share that matters. For each person that will look different. Some sing, some read, some dance, some walk in nature and talk with God.. They look to the sky and trees and ask their questions and they find answers. I think a seed has been planted. But we don't have to water it. It is not like a weed seed that grows without your permission. It is a gift, a rare and wonderful flower to behold.. faith through the awe in its presence.. The fragrance, an aroma that we cannot see, in its sweetness touches us.<br>  If we choose to water that seed. This is just my personal experience therefore my beliefs.

No-body can be born a Southern Baptist, a Sunni Muslim, a Theravada Buddhist.  You have to be carefully taught.  Which some call indoctrination, even brainwashing.<br>  <br>  But why do we want to engineer religions, if there is nothing "out there" to respond to?  I am aware of some of the evolutionary explanations here, but they seem to beg the question.  For example, if religion serves the purpose of comforting us in the face of death, how come we need such comfort?  Why can't we be matter of fact about it, oh when you're dead you rot, that's it?  Why have we evolved with such a capacity for angst when we contemplate the possiblity of ceasing to exist and never knowing that we aren't around any more?<br>  <br>  Seems to me that religions exist because of the human need to transcend our own nature, to aspire to be more than the animals we know we are.  And that need IS innate.  We are not naturally religious, but we are naturally spiritual.  How we have evolved to be such, from creatures which are creatures and nothing more, is a fascinating question, but so is "how come we're intelligent, if the evolutionary forces that brought us here are completely mindless".  And that one foxed Darwin himself.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	I am certain that the religious truly believe that they were born religious.|`|J8uhpecYaa	You haven't heard of 'the god gene?'

One leading idea is that religion is an evolutionary adaptation that makes people more likely to survive and pass their genes onto the next generation. In this view, shared religious belief helped our ancestors form tightly knit groups that cooperated in hunting, foraging and childcare, enabling these groups to outcompete others. In this way, the theory goes, religion was selected for by evolution, and eventually permeated every human society<br>  <br>  It turns out that human beings have a natural inclination for religious belief, especially during hard times. Our brains effortlessly conjure up an imaginary world of spirits, gods and monsters, and the more insecure we feel, the harder it is to resist the pull of this supernatural world. It seems that our minds are finely tuned to believe in gods.|`|3ZzlrChgaa	God gave you a chance to choose.

Jesus never said, do not pray. We are all sinners, even the saved. They are just forgiven. God listens to the heart of a repentant sinner that is seeking Him.

HQrqA2I1aa	Why support something you clearly don't like? church is a choice. Go to a less money driven one and find a better pastor. Or go to one that requires no patronage|`|cx8SnAnVaa	"Tithing" for almost every church goes directly to the pastor or the priest as his income.<br>  Tithing as taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints goes to the construction of buildings and the "establishment of the kingdom of God". Not a dime goes to someone's pocket. It is used to help in times of crisis and national disaster. I feel much better paying when I know how it is being used, than if its just going to the pastors BMW car payment.|`|xR2wnheVaa	What you give need only be between you God.|`|RnC2mF5Faa	The initial illustration in the Bible about any tithing concerns the account of Abraham and Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Following the slaughter of the kings, Abraham returned to central Palestine with his nephew named Lot, the other captives, and with a large amount of spoil that was taken from the northern kings (verses 16–17). Abraham then met Melchizedek and gave him a tenth of the spoil. "He gave him tithes of all" (verse 20).<br>  <br>  "And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: ‘If  God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God ... and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."<br>  <br>   Tithing is an issue that many Christians struggle with. In many churches tithing is over-emphasized. At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the Biblical exhortation in regards to making offerings to the Lord. Tithing / giving is intended to be a joy, a blessing. Sadly, that is rarely the case in the church today.<br>  <br>  Tithing is an Old Testament concept. The tithe was a requirement of the law in which all Israelites were to give 10% of everything they earned and grew to the Tabernacle / Temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5). Some understand the Old Testament tithe as a method of taxation to provide for the needs of the priests and Levites of the sacrificial system. The New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system. Paul states that believers should set aside a portion of their income in order to support the church (1 Corinthians 16:1-2).<br>  <br>  The New Testament nowhere assigns a certain percentage of income to set aside, but only says it is to be “in keeping with his income” (1 Corinthians 16:2). The Christian church has essentially taken the 10% figure from the Old Testament tithe and applied it as a “recommended minimum” for Christians in their giving. Although the New Testament does not identify a specific amount or percentage to give, it does talk about the importance and benefits of giving. They should give as they are able, “in keeping with his income.” Sometimes that means giving more than a tithe, sometime that may mean giving less than a tithe. It all depends on the ability of the Christian and the needs of the church. Each and every Christian should diligently pray and seek God’s wisdom as to whether to participate in tithing and/or for how much he or she should give (James 1:5). “Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).<br>  <br>  If you feel that your pastor is rich & is not using the money for the Glory of God.Then I suggest you go to another Church that uses the tithe for God's glory and not to feed their greed.|`|nHizaTiDaa	I know what you mean.  The Bible says we should support the one who "feeds us"...<br>  <br>  But to see the "country club" "churches" of today- yes, the pastors living FAR far better than I do!  Big big buildings, and yet you feel funny if you go before the church (which ARE the PEOPLE not the building)- to ask for money because your friend has no insurance and needs a dental trip badly~!<br>  <br>  This is all skewed up I think.<br>  <br>  You have the Roman Church all rich and powerful. <br>  <br>  You've got the TBN nuts living like kings and queens.<br>  <br>  WE are the church.  Our pastors should "be one of us" and be on the same level I should think.  No more salary than the rest of his flock.<br>  <br>  A good pastor IS worth his salary however.  A proper functioning church- the elders, the pastor should be available for FREE counseling! That is his function. Not just giving the sermon once a week! <br>  <br>  Sadly- I have noticed that not many church even do that!!<br>  <br>  A daughter of mine needed marriage counseling badly and HER super huge country club church with FIVE pastors...<br>  <br>  NO free couseling available!!! They were given names of couselers and expected to PAY hourly for it!<br>  <br>  This is SO SO SO messed up.<br>  <br>  That is not right.|`|AA10471892	You are quite wrong in your premise.  You are not "supposed" to give 10% or a tithe to ministers or churches. The tithe was an old covenant requirement, and it was not based on money.  If you have a pastor who teaches you have to give him 10%, you have a wolf for a pastor.<br>  <br>  Ministers are supposed to be supported through free-will offerings.<br>  <br>  .|`|3WYcPsm4aa	The money does more than pay the pastor... it goes to pay the mortage, the utilities, staff, worship supplies, Sunday school supplies, missions work, insurance on the building, your share of pastor's SS and Medicare tax, on and on.

If it's not... then you can start questioning!|`|AA11503457	Jesus himself said tything was right, and he didn't mention animals, he mentioned spices (I believe Luke 11:42).

But I don't think you have any excuse for disobeying the Bible.|`|4kuWOZowaa	The bible says 10% of your earnings no matter what it is.<br>  <br>  I agree the tithes go to the church not the pastor of the church.

The bible is not smart at all.  It is a book - paper and ink.  It is no more intelligent than your average rock.<br>  <br>  The dinosaurs, modern scientists tell us, are all extinct.  As often as they are wrong about animals becoming extinct, I find myself questioning the accuracy of that theory.  Still, I haven't seen any...<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The earth being 6,000-8,000 yrs old!<br>  <br>  Who told you that, and why did you believe them?<br>  <br>  <br>  3) Where are the dino's in the bible?<br>  <br>  The same place as the cats, the squirrels, the ducks, the clams, etc. etc.  The bible makes no effort to list every animal species - not even every animal species found in the region in which it was written.  Not even close, in fact.  Why don't you ask, "where are the ptarmigans in the bible?" or "where are the serval cats in the bible?"<br>  <br>  <br>  4) We obviously have evidence of them, and dating puts them back millions of years.<br>  <br>  So, what's your point?  Oh, right - you believe in that 6,000 year old earth thing that someone who hasn't actually read the bible told you.  OK, let's pretend for a second that the earth *is* only 6,000 years old.  You mention "dating".  How does that dating work?  I'll tell you:  it's called radiometric dating.  Radiometric dating is based on several assumptions, the most important of which are that<br>  a) isotopes have always decayed at the same rate as they do now<br>  b) isotopes have always appeared in the same proportion as they do now<br>  <br>  Now, these are not unreasonable assumptions - that is, they might be true, and we have never seen a case (in recent times, of course) in which they were not true.  IF you believe that they are true, you can trust radiometric dating.  Since we have no other way of dating such ancient things as fossils with anything even remotely resembling accuracy, scientists are forced to adopt these assumptions when attempting to date a fossil (or anything else using radiometric dating).<br>  <br>  However, it is quite possible - and reasonable - that both of these assumptions are incorrect.<br>  <br>  SO, if you DO believe in a 6,000 year old earth, you can claim - reasonably - that radiometric dating techniques are questionable - and, the longer the time span that has passed, the more likely it is that conditions varied from the 2 primary assumptions .  In other words, the older the date, the more "off" radiometric dating is likely to be.<br>  <br>  There is one final thing, though:  apparently we have historical records that predate 4,000 B.C.E.  I can't recall the details, but remember reading that we have historical records reaching back at least 2,000 years before this.  Perhaps that is where you get the "8,000".  Radiometric dating is contestable, but if there are actual human records of a time that can be proven - without radiometric dating - to go back 8,000 years, we have to admit that the earth is at least 8,000 years old - right?<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Even among christian researchers, the best guess for "behemoth" was a hippopotamus, NOT a dinosaur.<br>  <br>  As for "leviathin", the bible claims it breathed fire and smoke.

You have asked several questions recently aimed at trying to discredit The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it's members.  <br>  <br>  Did you find anything else in the bible while you were finding Jesus - like maybe some of His teachings?  Teachings like "love one another" -"judge not" or "do unto others as you would be done by?"  Did you learn while "finding Jesus" that He is the Christ, the Promised Messiah, the Savior and Redeemer of the world?  And did you read about Jesus throwing corrupt people from the temple?  What do you think that the temple was supposed to be used for?<br>  <br>  Utah County is a beautiful place with beautiful people.

Not just in the New Testament but the Old testament as well. <br>  <br>  It talks constantly of the temple.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the verses which talk about priests and the clothing they wore in the Temple. <br>  <br>  Exodus 28: 3-4 <br>  <br>  3  And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br>  4  And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br>  <br>  It goes on and on about Priests and the various sacred clothing they wore. <br>  <br>  Many of the scriptures also talk about how the Temple was constructed. The word Temple in the scriptures is mentioned quite frequently. Obviously the Temple was of importance in Old and New Testiment times. Why do you think it's not of any importance now? No the cermonies are  not directly mentioned. Why do you think that may be? Perhaps the people of that time held the same reverence and consideration that these ceremonies were sacred. but...  Jesus also mentioned <br>  <br>  Mathew  7:6-8<br>  <br>  6  ? Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.<br>  7  ?

P0MRKEHXaa	Well, according to some channeled information that I have been reading, and it sounds possible to me, everything is energy at different levels of vibration. The first and unending form of this energy is consciousness. Supposedly the original creative entity commonly known as "God" was a part of a vast sea of this consciousness. This part of the "allness" decided it wanted to experience individuality and to create. So it created a spherical border between itself and the rest of the allness, so as not to corrupt it.Then to make room for it's new creations, it contracted itself into a dense singularity. From thre it started to create, first some other individual sphere's of consciousness which it taught and were like it's first children. Then they became the first co-creators who in turn created lower beings whom they taught, and so on, and so on, until you get what we have here today; basically directed evolution with a purpose of both collecting experiences to share with the rest of the consciousness we are all a part of, and at the same time an educational experience for our individual consciousnesses, so that we too may grow to become co-creators someday.|`|P6atY3xXaa	The Bible says he always existed, that he is from everlasting to everlasting (eternity backward and forward).<br>  <br>  Jude<br>  25to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!

And a deviation from the teaching against homosexuality would be a deviation from Orthodox teachings.<br>  <br>  If a cleric is found in this sin, then his bishop would normally remove his ability to serve (i.e. he is defrocked) or very occasionally will permit this cleric to continue to serve provided he sincerly repents of this sin and does not repeat the activity, and thus bring confusion and turmoil to the flock.  <br>  <br>  2) Irrespective of a persons individual sins - an canoncially ordained priest in "good standing" (i.e. not prevented from serving by a bishop) can still effect the Mysteries (Sacraments).  <br>  <br>  This is a reference to an ancient heresy called Donatism.  Which implied that the good deeds or lack thereof of a cleric had a bearing on the effecting of the Mysteries.  i.e. it is not God doing the work but the "worthy" cleric.  <br>  <br>  We know of course that we are all sinful (priests too) and it is only through God's grace and mercy that priests are able serve the mysteries.|`|AA11521494	There are an incredible number of homosexual priests in the church.

Pagans and Satanists have no trouble with homosexuality at all.<br>  <br>  Not getting at you personally but if you could spell better it would make the question more understandable.|`|AA11849917	You need to narrow down your question, because as it stands right now, it is both arrogant and presumptuous, and anytime you ask an accusatory question, you better make sure you have some facts to back up your accusations with!<br>  <br>  If not, then you're just slinging mud, boxing the air, tearing down straw men.<br>  <br>  So, where's your evidence that all Christians have gay priests?  Either "Put up, or shut up".  In other words, "Put your money where your mouth is."<br>  <br>  At least I'll give you credit for realizing that homosexuality IS a sin according to the Bible.  Thank you for not twisting THAT one like so many people try to do.  So, you don't get an "F-" for this question, you only a "D".|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	I take it you're not Christian.  I'm not sure if you are atheist or not.  But I personally do not have nor am I responsible for what priests do or dont do.  I dont explain the Bible or try to justify my beliefs about anything.

However, skin tones of people change to fit the region that they live in.<br>  <br>  Yes, if that were true then it would mean that the human race is just a giant puddle of incest.<br>  <br>  As for your last question, that is just one of the many plot holes of the Bible.|`|1NTjyGblaa	- because bible/religion is bull...<br>  <br>  - because bible/religion is bull...<br>  <br>  - because bible/religion is bull...<br>  <br>  - because bible/religion is bull...|`|968sJIY1aa	There are no dinosaurs in the Bible because the people who wrote the stories in the Bible didnt know about dinosaurs; they wrote it long after dinosaurs were gone - so they didnt even know about them until hundreds of years later when scientists discovered dinosaur bones.<br>  <br>  - The Bible doesnt mention every single thing what happened, only about the people - so even if they did know what dinosaurs were, they would probably not mention them anyway (unless it was to do with some sort of event orienated with God).<br>  <br>  - Some Christians believe that the existence of dinosaurs was mentioned because it mentions some type of animals which were dinosaur-like:<br>  Behemoth (see Job 40:15)<br>  Leviathan (see Job 3:8, Job 41:1, Psalm 74:14, Psalm 104:26, Isaiah 27:1)<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve might not be all true, because before Genesis was written, story-telling was a big thing and for many generations the Adam and Eve story was passed on through stories (so there was probably a bit of 'chinese-whispers' going on there) and by the time it was written in Genesis, it was probably changed quite a lot.<br>  <br>  The people before Jesus still went to Heaven or Hell. You go to either of them according to what you've done on Earth and how well you obeyed God, people had good relationships with God long before Jesus came. e.g:<br>  Genesis 26:12 Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.<br>  <br>  So this man, Isaac, already knew about God and had obviously been worshipping him for some time now, because it says God blessed him. <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped|`|nq2LWqoKaa	Before Jesus, there was still God. those who obeyed him went to heaven.|`|ChIFashLaa	In answer to your first quesiton:<br>  The bible does mention Dinosaurs in  Job 40<br>  15   Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.<br>  16   Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.<br>  17   He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<br>  18   His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.<br>  19   He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.<br>  20   Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<br>  21   He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.<br>  22   The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.<br>  23   Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.<br>  24   He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares<br>  <br>  In answer to your seconf question:<br>  You will find in Genesis 11: 1-9 Here is the short summary-<br>   <br>  Up until this point in the Bible, the whole world had one language - one common speech for all people- one race. The people of the earth became skilled in construction and decided to build a city with a tower that would reach to heaven. By building the tower they wanted to make a name for themselves and also prevent their city from being scattered.<br>  <br>  God came to see their city and the tower they were building. He perceived their intentions, and in His infinite wisdom, He knew this "stairway to heaven" would only lead the people away from God. He noted the powerful force within their unity of purpose. As a result, God confused their language, causing them to speak different languages so they would not understand each other. By doing this, God thwarted their plans. He also scattered the people of the city all over the face of the earth.<br>  <br>  In answer to the third question-<br>  Yes we are all slightly related to one another<br>  <br>  For your fourth question I am honestly not sure. I believe God decided who He believed were His followers and who were not and took His followers|`|ci6f63Ifaa	It's a fact that the Bible is full of contradictions and things that don't add up when you take real life evidence into account. <br>  <br>  I was raised a Christian and when I was a child,  I asked a lot of questions about certain things and never got a satisfactory answer. <br>  <br>  I started researching a lot of things for myself and what I found is that the Bible is a collection of books that were written by human beings and edited by human beings.  There were ancient meetings of church officials that were held to decide what would go in the Bible and what books would be left out.<br>  <br>  One of these famous meetings was called the Council of Nicaea (google it). The Roman Emperor Constantine presided over the council which was made up of leaders of different sects (divisions) within Christianity. Many of these early church leaders disagreed over many issues regarding Christian doctrine.<br>  <br>  The Emperor Constantine wanted one religion (and one form of Christianity) that everyone in the empire would have to follow (by law).  <br>  The church leaders argued back and forth and eventually certain views and opinions won out over others.  <br>  <br>  The views that won out were then declared the official doctrine by Constantine.  He decreed that all dissenting views would henceforth be considered heresy and it would be a crime to follow any of them.  Things got so bad that one guy named Arius (who taught that Jesus did not exist at the beginning of time with God), was declared a heretic and exiled from the empire by Constantine. <br>  <br>  The point of all of this is that the set of beliefs that we consider to be Christian doctrine today is the result of man-made decisions and actions that happened centuries ago.  If the other views that lost out at that council had won instead, we would have grown up with completely different beliefs.<br>  <br>  The reason why so many things that are taught and accepted in church don't make logical sense is because the truth is the Bible and Christian teachings are the result of ideas human beings decided on and declared to be the official Church dotrine.  <br>  <br>  The men who put together the book that we call the Bible were just as human as you or me.  Napoleon said, "History is a set of lies agreed upon".  I'm not saying that everything in the Bible is a lie (the Bible does contain some truth). <br>  <br>  However,  the reality is that it is a flawed book (actually a collection of 66 books) that was written by flawed human beings who each had their own ideas, personal agendas, etc.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, I still believe in God but I view God and life in a more spiritual sense than a religious sense.  Organized religions like Christianity usually have some spiritual truths in them but the problem is that you have to learn what to listen to and what to ignore.|`|hMNOBYHCaa	1.  Not every single second of history is recorded in the Bible.  Some of the Bible is written in terms that humans will understand, like God making the world in 7 days.  God is outside of time, so a day for God may not be 24 hours.  On one of those days when he created animals, the dinosaurs were there.  Genesis doesn't mention penguins either, but they exist.  <br>  <br>  2.  People spread out to different areas, and their pigment and hair acclimated to the region.  People who moved to hot sunny places have darker pigment to protect their skin from sun damage.  <br>  <br>  3.  Yes, everyone is related if you search back far enough.  In addition to being descendants of Adam and Eve, we are also God's children, making us all brothers and sisters.<br>  <br>  4.  We don't know the fate of any individuals.  We assume that the people from then that loved God and followed his laws are with him in heaven, but we really can't know that.  God is merciful, but also just, so everyone has to do he can and live according to God's laws, and trust in Him for salvation.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	why arent the dinasours in the bible, even though we have ACTUAL proof of them existing?<br>  The term 'dinosaurs' is relatively new. Back in Moses' time they were just animals. They were there and they were on then ark. Now they are much smaller as are we.<br>  How are there many different colors of people and many different languages if Adam and eve were white?<br>  Adam and Chava (eve) were Hebrew. As were all of their offspring. When the tower of babel was built out of sin G-d showed them His power by spreading them out all over the world and causing them to speak in different languages.<br>  Adam and Eve were the 1st 2 people on the earth, then would that mean that EVERONE is related to each other?<br>  We ALL came from them. If one could trace their lineage back to the beginning of time one could see that we were all once Hebrew.<br>  If Jesus came after all that good stuff was created and many people have lived and died before he came, and Jesus came to earth so that normal people could go to heaven and stuff, then what happened to the people before Jesus? Where did they go?<br>  This is a tough one. The Jewish people were expected to follow The Torah as closely as they could. im not sure what gave them salvation b4 Yeshua (you refer to Him as jesus) but clinging to G-d and to Torah was what they were commanded to do.

And they even have them online!|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	"As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinner and allowing him to be reconciled to God."|`|G2PRIe3laa	I think recognizing your sins and repenting for them|`|Ne9rXERpaa	It's when you try to make up for past wrongdoing.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	To bring the separated back together. <br>  <br>  Jesus is ATONEMENT for our sins.  We are separated from the Lord by our sins, and we are only brought back to the Lord by believing in Jesus alone.  HIS atonement alone paid for our sins.  Nothing else forgives our sins.  Jesus paid for all our sins past, present, and future, we simply believe to be saved.  And all believers are still sinners.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|JTQOTrrFaa	let's say you were held for ransom.<br>  the money paid to set you free is<br>  an atonement.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Has to do with Jesus as the mediator, True God and True Man, able to bring mankind back to unity with God, provided we want that<br>  <br>  <br>  atone (v.) <br>      1555, from adv. phrase atonen (c.1300) "in accord," lit.

I pray all day long for him to no avail, God told me it's time to move on, I listened but didn't know what to do, a few weeks later God sent me to see a beautiful apartment, if I'd been looking on my own I couldn't have found a place so nice, satan has my husband so blinded until he don't even see I've just about than packed up the whole house! Like I said I love my husband but I am not going to let satan take me with him, I talk he lie. it had gotten to the point that I couldn't take it no longer, that's when God stepped in. I know it's gonna hurt for a while but I know with God on my side I'll be alright! I know if God don't answer you prayers it's because what you're asking for is not what He feel you need at that point & time.

FOk9gcuWaa	*goth* - Someone who likes the darker side of things. They usually listen to rock and metal music. Goths are fun to be around and aren't afraid to laugh at themselves every so often. They don't worship Satan and aren't evil despite what some ignorant people might say. Goths don't all dress alike either. They like to create their own unique style. Goths are also very intelligent and creative. A lot of them are writers and artists. Goths DON'T envy the popular people. They are what they are because it makes them happy. Goths would rather stay who they are and be among the so called "freaks" than be like everyone else and be popular. They understand that there are more important things in life than popularity, and usually succeed in life while the popular ones don't become much of anything.<br>  <br>  *emo* - emo is short for EMOtional. it started as a music genre that came from punk but was more sensitive and emotional called emotive hardcore or emocore, but it evolved into fashion and a whole lifestyle and stereotype. emo kids are usually very sensitive, once again, emotional, creative, artistic, and quiet. they usually dress in mostly black and other dark colors like navy blue and dark green (the girls that are labeled emo but wear bright colors and dress like a little kid are scene which is like emo+prep). emos usually have facial piercings, especially lip rings. emo hair is usually short and covers one eye a common misconception is that emo means you cut yourself. IT DOESN'T!!! Not all emos cut themselves and not everyone that cuts themselves is emo.<br>  <br>  *Scene* - Like I said above, emo+prep. Kinda like emo, but happier. Wear bright colors and love Hello Kitty, Invader Zim, robots, dinosaurs, etc. Hair can be pretty much any color, but often has bright streaks in it or a blond streak in dark hair or dark streaks in blond hair. Hair is about shoulder length and is in a bunch of sort, choppy layers (real short on top but longer on bottom) Likes bands noone but other scene kids have heard of. Can be stuck up or MySpace whores.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Emo: dress in black and dyes hair, depressed, wanna die, usually black hair (dyed)<br>  Scene: they don't wanna die, similar style of clothing just more colourful, same for hair

uK3tkaOJaa	Not at all.  Muslims don't own exclusive rights to them.  And when you're in their country, it can be more comfortable to blend in with a head scarf.  You definately need em when you're in a mosque.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Yes, only Muslims can wear head scarfs.... NO OF COURSE NOT|`|93r3nCM1aa	No. They make you wear it if you want to attend their mosque (even if you're a non-muslim). <br>  <br>  Plus, many other people wear head scarves than just muslims.

Play with different ways to wear it with out looking traditional Muslim. Try placing it across your head about an inch below your hair line and then tying the whole thing back into a pony tail. <br>  You can also wear it like a wide headband. <br>  <br>  If you feel like it might be rude, or you feel like you shouldn't get some normal headbands and some dry shampoo for the trip.|`|XYDymAtYaa	?<br>  <br>  Sounds reasonable to me. When I've traveled to Muslim Countries, I always take a scarf in case I want to visit a place where it is requested...a shawl or something that I can simply wrap around at a moments notice..It is respectful.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking about a full head scarf to cover your hair later in your travels, perhaps you should consider a small tie back scarf..I can't imagine the benefits of wearing a full head scarf to cover greasy hair lol|`|IGYa2yF6aa	No, it's not rude. Head scarfs are worn all over the world. They're quite fashionable in some (non-Muslim) places. Can you say Hermes? They're extremely practical articles of clothing, particularly on windy days, when riding in convertibles, and in the cold.|`|VM1bGLhzaa	i am not muslim and i don't know too much about it. <br>  Canada is a free country and you have the right to use whatever you want, well within some limitations.<br>  what i want to say is that wearing or not the scarf is not rude, people respect different religions.|`|AA11977154	You wear whatever you like to wear, so long as it makes you feel good babes..:-)|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	i think it would depend on how you wore it.  if you wore it correctly it probably wouldn't be offensive.  but, if i were you, i'd consider just wearing a stocking or baseball hat or putting your hair in a ponytail.|`|LJik2RjRaa	It shouldn't!

Of course it takes a bit of money as well.<br>  <br>  Now flying without an aircraft, that's just crazy talk.<br>  <br>  Edit:  By the way for excitement/terror getting up to about 10k feet over the land surface and entering a spin stall beats any roller coaster or amusement park ride I have ever tried.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|u7o75zipaa	None.<br>  I'd probably think you were a freak.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I dismiss them NOW...for two reasons<br>  <br>  1) Is it important that I fly ?

3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	First of all, I read the bible & compare it with the Hebrew & Greek versions.<br>  Being born of God & spiritually sealed by the Holy Spirit, I ask God regarding His Written Word. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth & leads me in Gods Truth.<br>  So? I claim the Biblical scripture that promises me Salvation. Heaven is Salvation. Eternal Life. Eternal Life is what Jesus purchased for us on the cross of Calvary. And He raised from the dead with an everlasting flesh & bone. For us.<br>  <br>  The Word of God tells me to Love God firstly, Love my neighbors as myself. And love my enemies... Forgive others. Don't critically judge others. So?<br>  <br>  I couldn't go around stoning sinners. Because we are living in the age of Grace. Today is the day of salvation. Any sinner can turn to faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God & receive His atonement for their sins, & be washed clean & born of Gods Spirit becoming Gods child.<br>  <br>  The law of sin & death came by Moses. Truth & Grace came by Jesus Christ. The Old Covenant is between Israel and the LORD. While the New Covenant is between Jesus Christ the Lord & all who are redeemed by His blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is written that to be absent from this body (that gets buried), our spiritual soul is with the Lord forever. So? But it is true that Jesus is returning to reign the Millennium Reign of Christ, And the redeemed will raise up flesh & bone like He raised up and will rule & reign on earth with Him.|`|mQwyWWHtaa	God did something like that before there was Jesus, before you could accept him and automatically go to heaven. He did that because they did not command his law and there was no way that they could really be saved. There is a logical explanation to everything that God does and everything happens for a reason. <br>  <br>  I know that I am going to Heaven because I have accepted Jesus Christ as my personal saviour. God said that is all I have to do to receive his eternal love and life and salvation. Now I must go out and spread the word of his eternal love and the gracious gift that he allows everyone to receive.|`|nXxtBkguaa	I think it can...

What do you mean by "watered down" version, the Bible is the same as it was since it's inception, made more remarkable by the fact it's words carry so much meaning today.  As for God "killing hundreds", God is the barometer of morality, and is not to be judged by our human standards.

lxQ8dLC5aa	People want to know were they came from.  To some, being part of the Ape family makes them happy. The answer to evolution and the creation of man is a mystery that God has not given us a definitive  answer.  <br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that when God spoke to everyday people, he normally spoke in parables.  A parable is a story that illustrates a moral/religious concept or explains complex matters to ordinary people. The story of creation is just that - a parable, so that humankind could and can understand that God created this earth, everything living here and us.<br>  <br>  There is no reason you should assume that biology and the Bible disagree if you assume the the creation story in the Bible is a parable. Only certain religious groups believe every story in the Bible must be taken literally, word for word. No one, let me say that again, no one, takes every part of the Bible literally.  For example, the story of the wheat and the tares isn't literal.  It is a parable. So, is the creation story, a parable, telling us that God is our creator, that's it.<br>  <br>  Rest easy, if you believe, are baptized, receive the Holy Spirit, and ask for forgiveness; you will be in heaven with the righteous in Christ Jesus. I hope to see you there, beside Abraham, Moses, Elijah and all normal Christians with a big smile and a halo above your head.<br>  <br>  Godspeed.

H8WqMK1eaa	From Genesis 3 (NIV):<br>  "6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves." <br>  <br>  It looks like both of them ate it...although Eve technically took the first bite.  There was no seduction or trickery on Eve's part.  As you can see, her husband was with her, and it wasn't until BOTH of them ate of the fruit that their eyes were opened.|`|fz8PCFRgaa	It was a fruit, not necessarily an apple.  Eve ate it first, talked with the serpent (which means smooth in Hebrew) while Adam looked on and said nothing. She offered it to him and he took a bite and later blamed it on God who gave him the woman.  It is just a story, don't take it literally.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	I did, it was a yummy fuji apple too|`|QlB3VXWraa	They both ate the forbidden fruit but it was all Eve's fault.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Both|`|yAoldffKaa	Hate to be technical with you but, it wasn't an apple it just says 'fruit' in the Bible. <br>  <br>  Okay! I'm done, to answer your question both. Satan tempted Eve to take a bite, and she thought it was good so she also convinced Adam to take a bite too and he did. So, it was both.|`|cf84769c39c0ba4a53a95535563ec1e3aa	It's an allegory about temptation and the punishment/consequences that occur when doing something "forbidden".  In other words it doesn't matter who ate of the apple the result would have been the same...God was into guilt by association.|`|0QzASZQraa	Eve ate the fruit first then Adam.|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	Fruits don't exist. Also humans never existed.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	There is no evidence the fruit was an apple.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.<br>  <br>  Point of Order: Vlad Tepes and Elizabeth Bathory were not vampires. They were sadistic tyrants who abused their power to feed their homicidal impulses, but they were humans who lived and died. The act of drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating grass makes you a cow.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	to all the twilight fans out there vampires are not real in they do not exist plus it will warp in rot your brain just cause you seen the movie in read the book does not make any one or you a real vampire just make believe but hey if you want to live in that fantasy world knock your self out as long as you don't bite nobody for real or you mite get your butt kicked for real<br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|CCf6Y7DIaa	there actually is a very rare blood disorder, reported on by scientific american (2004 i think), where the hemoglobin that transports oxygen on blood cells is malformed and violently reacts with contact to radiation. a severe burning sensation is felt upon contact with the sun's rays, due to the blood actually cooking away exposed skin and connective tissues. <br>  <br>  -over time, frequent exposure to the sun can -and will- actually burn away the nose, lips and all other exposed areas, while causing severe anemia like symptoms. the tendency for skin to scar means the wounds will not heal without disfiguring.<br>  <br>  these people are often very sickly, exhibiting symptoms of blood disorder and historically, have made use of blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  the article that reported on this made an assumption that these unfortunate souls may be the origin of both the zombie and vampire myths. certainly, a shambling, hooded, groaning, noseless, faceless, skin-less, possibly enraged and insane human ought to be the origin of some monster tales.<br>  <br>  EDIT: it may have been a discover article<br>  <br>  EDIT: disorders known as porphyrias have also been fingered as being the originator of the vampire legend <br>  <br>  "This is a disease in which the body doesn't produce enough heme, an iron-rich pigment in the blood, making victims sensitive to sunlight, sometimes with reddish mouths. (Remember the Master in Buffy? He had "fruit-punch mouth.") There are different varieties of porphyria; the rarest, and most severe, leads to blistering and scarring of the skin, with the lips and gums becoming so taut that teeth protrude like fangs."<br>  <br>  from wikipedia: "Porphyrias are a group of inherited or acquired disorders of certain enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway ... They manifest with either skin problems or with neurological complications (or occasionally both).<br>  ...<br>  The acute, or hepatic, porphyrias primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in abdominal pain, vomiting, acute neuropathy, seizures and mental disturbances, including hallucinations, depression, anxiety and paranoia. Cardiac arrhythmias and tachycardia (fast heart rate) may develop as the autonomic nervous system is affected. Pain can be severe and can, in some cases, be both acute and chronic in nature. Constipation is frequently present, as the nervous system of the gut is affected, but diarrhea can also occur.<br>  ...<br>  The term derives from the Greek πορφ?ρα, porphura, meaning "purple pigment". The name is likely to have been a reference to the purple discolouration of feces and urine in patients during an attack.<br>  ...<br>  The cutaneous, or erythropoietic, porphyrias primarily affect the skin, causing photosensitivity (photodermatitis), blisters, necrosis of the skin and gums, itching, and swelling, and increased hair growth on areas such as the forehead. Often there is no abdominal pain, distinguishing it from other porphyrias.<br>  <br>  In some forms of porphyria, accumulated heme precursors excreted in the urine may cause various changes in color, after exposure to sunlight, to a dark reddish or dark brown color. Even a purple hue or red urine may be seen. Heme precursors may also accumulate in the teeth and fingernails, giving them a reddish appearance."|`|LF2t9DPZaa	No. They're mythical.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Do chickens have lips?|`|PJZRGsc3aa	well, someone has been watching too much twilight.|`|e3aZsDqwaa	nope too much twilight|`|XxZQ72J4aa	No, I don't think so. There are tons of theories as to where the idea came from, here's one:<br>  <br>  After someone has died, it's not uncommon for people to imagine that they saw the person walking around alive again. Determined to prove whether or not the person had risen from the grave, they would dig them up. Methane gas is produced inside dead bodies, causing them to swell, but sometimes it will be released through orifices. This might have made the dead body look like it was breathing, making the people think the person was alive and had, in fact, risen from the dead.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	I really want to know why you think they might be.<br>  <br>  They are not real as they are medically impossible.<br>  <br>  I challenge ANYONE to prove me wrong.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	*explodes|`|AA11605393	NO|`|BTkHkkJTaa	you can't be serious......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh wait, you are! hahahahaha. uhmm i'm done.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	no twilight is fake|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	Wha?

Because science is not the cause/creation/purpose.  so it's impossible to answer your question with complete certainty.  I do know that ghosts/witchcraft and things like that are real.  And is there a possibility that werewolves/vampires are real, yes there is.  is there a possibility that they don't yes there is.

6Zi7cA5Paa	There are five "pillars" of Islam-five requirements expected of all Muslims: <br>  <br>  1. The Creed (Kalima) <br>  <br>  La ilaha illa Allah; Muhammad rasul Allah-"There is no God but Allah and Mu-ham-mad is his messenger [or prophet]." <br>  <br>  This is the shahadah, the "confession" that Muslims recite at least once every day and more frequently when necessary. They are often the very first words a baby hears whispered in his ear, and the last words to be uttered by a dying man. An action worthy of praise brings the response, Alhamduli-llah, "Praise be to Allah." Speculations about the future are always accompanied by the words, Insha Allah, "If Allah wills." <br>  <br>  Allah is definitely center stage, not Muhammad. The prophet insisted he was never to be worshiped. "Muhammad is not more than an Apostle; many were the Apostles that passed away before him" (Qur'an 3:144). <br>  <br>  At Muhammad's funeral, when some believers found themselves hoping for a resurrection or Second Coming, Abu-Bakr, caliph ("successor") to the prophet, was quick to remind them: "O ye people, if anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead, but if anyone worships Allah, he is alive and dies not.…" <br>  <br>  Christianity considers its founder to be God, the Second Person of the Trinity. Muhammad wanted no such designation from Islam. There is only one God in this solidly monotheistic religion. That is Allah. Muhammad, the Holy Prophet, was just the messenger. <br>  <br>  2. Daily Prayer (Salat) <br>  <br>  The faithful are called to pray five times a day, though in America, at least, the two afternoon prayers can be combined. They ritually wash themselves (sand can be substituted for water in dry climates), face toward Mecca, and recite the Arabic prayers they learned in childhood. Hands will be raised to the side of the head as the words, Allahu akbar, "God is great," are spoken. Then the first sura of the Qur'an will be recited, followed by prayers and other verses. The worshiper will then bow, placing hands on knees, declare "glory to God," and, after again praising God in a standing position, descend to a posture of complete submission with knees, forehead, and hands on the ground, praying, "Glory to my Lord, the Most High!" After sitting and then repeating the posture of submission, the worshiper will resume a standing position, completing one full cycle of prayer. Two cycles are offered in the morning, four at noon, afternoon, and night, and three at sunset. After prayer the Muslim will turn his or her head to both sides and offer a blessing of peace to other Muslims and all who need God's guidance. <br>  <br>  Men will often go to the mosque if it is convenient, pausing at the entrance to remove their shoes. Women usually pray at home, but in these more liberated times there is a separate area for them at the mosque. The women will, of course, first cover their head. Modest dress is a requirement for both men and women. Shorts and T-shirts are very definitely out of order. If it happens to be Friday, the holiest day of the week, the Imam, or prayer leader (sometimes called a sheik), will deliver a sermon. In America, the Imam is usually the administrator of the community as well, much like clergy of other traditions. <br>  <br>  3. Almsgiving (Zakat) <br>  <br>  Between 2 percent and 10 percent of income is to be shared with the poor of the community. This pillar emphasizes the need to remember less fortunate neighbors. It is to be given voluntarily. But, as in other traditions, it is usually collected (in some countries it is an actual tax) and a record is kept. Wealth is not frowned upon in Muslim communities. After all, Allah blesses the faithful. But it is to be shared in a way that is not demeaning to the recipient. <br>  <br>  4. Fasting (Sawm) <br>  <br>  During the month of Ramadan, no food (even medicine), drink, smoking, or sex is allowed during daylight hours. The hours are computed and published these days, but it used to be understood that day begins when there is enough light to distinguish between a black thread and a white thread. <br>  <br>  After the sun goes down, however, it's time to joyfully feast with friends and family. <br>  <br>  During Ramadan, Muslims greet one another by saying, "Ramadan Mubarak," which means "A Blessed Ramadan," or perhaps "Salaam," which means "peace." <br>  <br>  5. Pilgrimage (Hajj) <br>  <br>  At least once during their lifetime, during the month of Dhu-al-Hijjah (the "month of pilgrimage"), Muslims are expected to make a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Muhammad and a holy city even before his time.For their whole lives, the pilgrims have faced Mecca during prayer.

It is worth seeing if only to see how this genius eventually managed to cope with his visual and auditory hallucinations.<br>  <br>  It took him some time, but he eventually became convinced that certain things he saw and heard did not exist in reality,. but there was something in his mind that convinced him that these manifestations were real.<br>  <br>  When he came to accept them for what they were his life took on a new and much happier dimension.  The hallucinations did not stop, but he was no longer deluded by them because he then understood them as products of his own mind.<br>  <br>  This insight allowed him to carry on with his life and not be sidetracked by the voices in his head or the characters he saw, as he had been for many years.<br>  <br>  Schizophrenia can be extremely destructive of the personality if not properly treated.  there are today so many good psychotropic drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of hallucinations, and can also restore peace to persons so afflicted.  <br>  <br>  If you can accept that they are delusions, however powerful they seem, then that is a good first step to acting under your own will rather than re-acting to hallucinatory diktats.<br>  <br>  I wish you well, and pray for your pain to cease.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL|`|wMrWVOsZaa	God  loves you infinitely.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofYrt9ymTRo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofYrt9ymT...</a>|`|pQfnXMRraa	try meditating on the notion of love for a few minutes a day.Gods Love is there in your heart you just need to be still.<br>  Lots of Love and cyber hugs|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Hoooo ray for Schizophrenia!

Since God is my judge I shall be judged fairly, He loves me and shall work Justice on my behalf because I depend on Him<br>  <br>  Has to do with Jesus as the mediator, True God and True Man, able to bring mankind back to unity with God, provided we want that<br>  <br>  <br>  PS The area of study known as Biblical Onomastics is fascinating.

We seek to live by the standards that He set forth in the bible, trusting that He knows what is best for us.  As such, the Bible tells us that we are to love, not judge, our neighbor - and leave the "judging" for God.  <br>  <br>  Daniel was one of God's prophets and I believe the name Danielle is the female form of Daniel.  Daniel followed God's ways closely and did some amazing things in telling others about God.  He definitely left "judging" others to God and did exactly what God wants all of us to do - follow His ways.  That's why I would suspect the name translates to God is my Judge in Hebrew.<br>  ~k

Instead many are preparing materially, by hording their money, buying guns and stocking up for the change which is ahead.<br>  <br>  If one loves the world we live in, and does as the world does, they will not be prepared spiritually as needed.  If one loves God more than the world, they shall be watched over in these changing times coming upon us.<br>  <br>  1 John, 2; 15,16.<br>  <br>  15.  Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.  If any man love the world, the love o the Father is not in him.<br>  <br>  16  For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br>  <br>  If you understand not what these scriptures truly mean, then you are not prepared spiritually for what's coming, <br>  <br>  America has entered the last stage of falling, as all other world power followed before they fell or were conquered.

zjzfWaGXaa	as far as swearing goes it doesn't turn me off, that would make me a hypocrite but some guys try to hard to use swear words where they just aren't needed. So as long as your not focusing on it I wouldn't be bothered and I don't think other guys would be. I just don't really put that into the thought when I'm deciding about how attractive a guy is. <br>  <br>  Besides swearing though language is a big deal for me. I don't care if a guy swears as long as the rest of his words are clear and intelligent. One of my big turn offs is a guy who can't make it through a sentence without using slang.|`|PNw70xuLaa	Honestly, it bugs me when guys (or anybody) swears all the time for no reason. But that doesn't mean you're not nice... I swear when I'm joking or there's no other word to use to describe what I'm trying to say. But I don't really cuss that much... I guess the main thing is that for me a guy has to have a good sense of humor, think I'm funny (get my jokes XD), but also be able to serious and have intelligent conversations. If he doesn't meet those qualifications then he either has to be REALLY hot or have some other great aspect, but that probably wouldn't last long anyway... As long as you're not too perverted XD|`|qJkRPhIKaa	Depends on the guy.<br>  <br>  Also the age group.<br>  <br>  Most guys age 13-18 are complete idiots who have no idea what they are doing besides looking at boobs and ***.<br>  <br>  however adults i would say someone who is just herself.|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	I like a girl to be easy going.

u7Vp848Oaa	1 (Isaiah 1:26): You are taking what they say to be a prophecy for Jesus. This is not. In Exodus 11:1, it says:  Now the LORD said to Moses, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely. Would that be a prophecy by to Jesus? No! Only where it talks about what will happen in Jesus' time is it talking about the prophecy's for his first coming. <br>  17 (Zechariah 8:23): This just says that back then people looked towards the Jewish Prophets to hear from the Lord. What does that have to do with Jesus?<br>  If you have more questions please e-mail me at fartfignuggem@yahoo.com<br>  thank you.|`|AA10153636	The first time he came to die for our sins.<br>  The second time he will rule the whole world..<br>  And yes I will say he will fulfill this when he comes again.<br>  A lot of what you have stated, he has fulfilled..<br>  Psalm 37:4, he has already given me the desires of my heart.<br>  Ez 40  The temple will be rebuilt very soon.<br>  Israel is now abundant and fruitful.<br>  Isa 25:8 will happen when the world is made new.  <br>  Most of the Jews have already returned to their homeland and more will come.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	You misunderstand.

8W066zbJaa	DICTIONARY OWNAGE|`|gxw1fP2aaa	No, you are not right.  First, you're selectively choosing to attach one definition of force to fit your question.  That's fine, but it's not very scientific.<br>  <br>  Second, the word force is someone's interpretation of that word and/or it's association with the word luck; namely, the guy who wrote that particular dictionary entry.  Perhaps he had too much coffee that day.  Who knows.<br>  <br>  Luck is a perceived thing.  Events occur, untold numbers of them all threaded together ... and eventually, a particular set of threads all add up to some other event or action which is perceived a luck.  Of course, if something other than that exact thread of events occur, you may end up at something other than luck.<br>  <br>  So luck is attached to some positive aspect of the event (winning lottery for example).<br>  <br>  It's the same as someone being astonished that they received a total of exactly $4.00 in change back from the store.  Wow, imagine that, exactly four dollars in change.  Of course $4.03 cents was just as likely really, in which case it would not be so amazing.|`|8f2e6b2b77e98982ec1a14639f6d0a1baa	1) No. Lucky is supernatural, actually. It's kind of like a superstition that people kind of like to indulge in. Like, if there was a lottery. It's statistically likely to choose anyone, but it chooses one particular person. There's no reason why, per se. It's just that it has to choose one person. Could have been anyone. Lucky is like... a compliment. <br>  2) The force... as in like.. .from the Star Wars movies? Or as in Physics?<br>  3) A living being is anything that can moderate its internal environment (according to my human physiology book!)<br>  <br>  Force isn't really an existing object. It's just a measurement of some quality. Think of an inch. Can you hold an inch? Can you eat a mile?|`|Blajij6iaa	You give an obscure reference to an event that may or may not have taken place and expect people to assess exactly how a person survived this incident?  What kind of answers were you expecting?<br>  <br>  Why didn't you use this definition of luck?  <br>  "a combination of circumstances, events, etc., operating by chance to bring good or ill to a person"<br>  It didn't sound supernatural enough?|`|waz8ONEEaa	luck is a statistical probability.<br>  <br>  research has shown that people who think they are lucky, tend to take more chances, and thus, see more positive outcomes or ill-probable situations.<br>  <br>  this is because people who don't take the chance, never see a positive outcome for them.<br>  <br>  luck is nonexistent. <br>  luck is nothing more than what someone perceives it.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Being hit by a big truck and surviving is not a miracle.<br>  <br>  Nearly getting hit by a truck, but being saved at the last minute by an invisible force that lifts you into the air and sets you down safely 10 meters away...

Luck is not necessarily used like that very often. When people say lucky they generally mean very fortunate.

We haven't heard from the unlucky ones.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	No, there's a difference between "lucky" and "miracle".<br>  <br>  "Lucky" does not imply the intervention of a supernatural, magical being.  That's the difference.  It means "Occuring by chance".  In the case you're talking about, it's a positive occurance, but still one that's occuring by CHANCE.|`|pfdIK6Opaa	If you're implying God is involved in these situations, isn't he playing favorites with us? 999 out of 1000 times a person will die in that situation so why do you think God would decide to intervene just this once?<br>  <br>  You know what luck is, that definition you derived is not what everyone was using.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Feel free to call it a miracle, if by miracle you mean lucky.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	luck is merely the run of probability either good or bad.

5axNEp8jaa	There is a Difference between being Racist and Being Racially aware.<br>  England is a Small nation and its losing its character and identity at an alarming rate due to the fact its being given away to those who just don't deserve a piece of it, Nature abhors a vacuum and when those so different and who haven't culturally evolved and have no Identity in an already established nation come in such huge numbers, what may appear to be racism will be a by product of the indigenous population.<br>  I believe Multiculturalism is a good thing, but in England's case its about the numbers and Quality of the immigrants that's so unsustainable.|`|8RmazUuBaa	Who are these BNP folks, they sound like they LOVE thier country..<br>  If I was in England Id join that party..|`|hKP5sQewaa	I don't know what Propaganda you've been watching,<br>  I Live in England and its not racist here where i live, Of course there are a few racists, but not many.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Probably is, not necessarily due to the actual white British population but because of all the different races who've gain British Citizenship are racist against each other as well against the real British population who origins are in England rather than people from overseas who've have British Citizenship, I would say the BNP actual intentions I've seen out of the media are positive, but because of how the media shows things and how people are there is a large scale of racism and as a result walking in one part of England to another can be like walking into another country, generally the way of viewing how divided places in England are is by displaying the % of races in areas and that will show how divided England is, then again this is what should of been expected by Labour when they went and loosen the security of immigration which have made migrants flood into the country gaining Citizenship very easily as a result the British Tradition itself is near enough gone.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	I can't speak for the people of England 'cos I'm from Scotland so I'll give you my perspective on racism.I know very few people who are racist,but I know many who are sick and tired of immigrants coming to our country and telling us how we should live our lives and making demands on our resources.They should only be given permission to live here if they are prepared to accept our way of life,our education system etc. and to become part of our society and not the other way round.They have no right to preach hatred on our streets (and I apply this to all groups who encourage racism and religious bigotry) We are sick to death of political correctness and being told we are racists because we don't agree with their views or beliefs.|`|aTS9NoTNaa	I'm from England and trust me everyone I know hates The BNP...it's actually pretty sad that you think they represent us...|`|km2rYhTcaa	na i think its russia...have u ever seen the russian neo nazi beheading vid...google it and youll see that they are crazy in russsia|`|2EHpbdwIaa	Try going to Spain....Ive heard some pretty shocking things said about African Americans by Spanish people when I was over there. <br>  <br>  Theres obviously racist people in Britain.

It might seem that way because race issues get blown up out of all proportion by the media over here. And Britain is deffinitely not openly racist if you ask me, with the exception of the BNP I think that there are very few English people that fall into that catergory. <br>  <br>  Ive travelled extensively and from what ive experienced Britain is actually one of the least racist countries ive visited. But for some reason a minority of people seem to want to make out that the overall white population are all racist.

AA10034051	Jesus commanded we have a physical baptism.<br>  <br>  John 3:3,5 - Jesus says, "Truly, truly, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." When Jesus said "water and the Spirit," He was referring to baptism (which requires the use of water, and the work of the Spirit). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BAPTISM:<br>  <br>  is done FOR the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38)<br>  <br>  is done to SAVE us (1Peter 3:21, Acts 2:40, Mark 16:16)<br>  <br>  Is done to WASH AWAY OUR SINS (Acts 22:16)<br>  <br>  is done to be REBORN to new life (John 3:5, Romans 6:3-6)<br>  <br>  is done to CLOTHE ourselves with Christ (Gal 3:26-27)<br>  <br>  is done so that GOD will RESURRECT us from death (Colossians 2:12, Romans 6:3-6)<br>  <br>  is done as a REQUIRMENT to enter heaven (John 3:5, Mark 16:16)<br>  <br>  is done to put us INTO CHRIST (Romans 6:3-6, Galatians 3:26-27, 1Corinthians 12:13)<br>  <br>  Peter explained what happens at baptism when he said, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38). But he did not restrict this teaching to adults. He added, "For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him" (2:39). We also read: "Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name" (Acts 22:16). These commands are universal, not restricted to adults. Further, these commands make clear the necessary connection between baptism and salvation, a <br>  connection explicitly stated in 1 Peter 3:21: "Baptism . . . now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	First of all the word baptism means immersion in greek. It was a burial of ones old self.<br>  Here's what the bible says: <br>  1-Mark 16:15,16 - "He Who Believes and Is Baptized Will Be Saved." <br>  Man says; He who believes is saved and may then be baptized. <br>  bible says; "He Who Believes and Is Baptized Will Be Saved <br>  <br>  2-Acts 2:38 - "Repent and Be Baptized for Remission of Sins" <br>  Are sins forgiven (remitted) before baptism or as a result of it? Note that the purpose of baptism is clearly stated: it is for remission of sins.Consider the people to whom Peter was speaking. <br>  <br>  If "for" means "because they already had remission," then Peter must have been talking to saved people. Was he? <br>  <br>  He had just convicted them of the sin of killing Jesus (v36), and they were pricked in heart and asked what to do (v37). They did not already have remission, but stood in need of receiving it. <br>  <br>  Peter then told them to "repent." If they already had remission, why did they need to repent? The command to repent proves these people were not already saved, but were still sinners needing to receive remission. <br>  <br>  3-Acts 22:16 - Be Baptized and Wash away Your Sins <br>  <br>  4-1 Peter 3:21 - Baptism saves us. <br>  5-Galatians 3:27 - We are baptized into Christ. <br>  6-Romans 6:3 - We are baptized into Jesus' death.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	it's an empty and meaningless ritual kept around by indoctrinating systems and stemming from thousands and thousands of years ago when they couldn't even clean water and develop indoor plumbing.

aaCMNSB2aa	I won't tell either of them unless you don't want to be friends with him anymore. Even if they break up, taking his ex would not end very well. Good friends don't do this. If you feel hurt bottling it up inside, think about this- You tell him he's going to feel hurt and you're STILL not going to feel good. Though what I feel doesn't matter. You asked a question and I'll give you the best answer I can give you that YOU'RE looking for, not what I'm looking for. So here it is:<br>  <br>  1) Get to know her but keep it friendly. Nothing to close just ask her questions about who she is; favorite colors, favorite band, her interests. She'll feel closer to you and you can deceiver if she's worth ruining your friendship. After you decided whether or not you still want her- back off. If you don't want her then you don't need to be so close. If you do then backing off will be good because you don't yet want her to know. If she finds out she'll dump it on her unexpected boyfriend which nobody wants. Not to mention she'll think you're a jerk for doing that to you best friend.<br>  <br>  2) Tell him, without telling him. Mention how she looks, or how funny, sweet, smart she is. Later mention how he's very lucky because she's perfect and how you would love to be with a girl like her. After a while he'll start to wonder what's up. (He can start distancing himself from you or even get a little upset if he's suspecting. If he asks if you like his girl then go for step 4.)<br>  <br>  3) When you get alone with her mention you HAD a crush on her but you just tried ignoring her because how your friend and her are together and everything but now you just think she's cool. If she responds badly- abort plan! If she acts like cool with it then there is only one thing to do...<br>  <br>  4) Here is where things can get messy. It's up to you to decide on how far it will get- It's confession time. Do something really nice for him to butter him up a little. Remind him how good of a friend you've been throughout the years so maybe he won't be too mad at you. Then tell him that you've put a lot of thought into this and even tried to back off but things just didn't work out. You like his girlfriend and you wished you didn't because you don't want him to be mad at you. But now that you know your feelings for her isn't subsiding for her you're not sure what you should do. From here you can take the rings. He can get angry and not listen or you guys can come up with a conclusion. Just try to be the up most understanding to how he's feeling.<br>  <br>  ::Note:: You guys are still young. They may break up before you even finish the proses. In that case find out if she likes you first and then tell him before you ask her out.<br>  <br>  Again, I don't think it's a good idea. There are so many girls out there you don't need that one. You can talk to someone you trust that have no connection to him about it until you can move on to someone else. I hope you make the right decision.<br>  <br>  --Good luck to you three, CutieNiki|`|e5VUwaRsaa	You don't. Simple as that.

I3rjYVUFaa	Not. Evolution does NOT go with the Bible.<br>  <br>  Philosophical naturalism--the worldview undergirding evolution--can provide only three explanations:<br>  <br>  First, the universe is merely an illusion. This notion carries little weight in an age of scientific enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Second, the universe sprang from nothing. This proposition flies in the face of both the laws of cause and effect and energy conservation. As has been well said, "Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could. Or, to put it another way, there simply are no free lunches. The conditions that hold true in this universe prevent any possibility of matter springing out of nothing.<br>  <br>  Third, the universe eternally existed. The law of entrophy, which predicts that a universe that has eternally existed would have died "an eternity ago" of heat loss, devastates this hypothesis.<br>  <br>  There is, however, one other possibility. It is found in the first chapter of the first book of the Bible: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In an age of empirical science, nothing could be more certain, clear, or correct.<br>  <br>  Rom 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<br>  <br>  The bottom line of evolution is the mathematical model:<br>  NOTHING + TIME + CHANCE = EVERYTHING<br>  <br>  Of course, this is ridiculous, so they need LOTS of time...But they just don't have it.

I was going to tell you that that wasn't a good idea. But your explanation is even worse. Your fiancee is just using you to pay for her tattoo. It has nothing to do with your engagement at all. I also have a problem with her not announcing the engagement until she has a ring. The point of getting engaged is because you are planning to get married, it's not so you can show off a shiny new bauble to your friends.<br>  I think what you need to get is a less materialistic fiancee.

Remember also that President Bush said that he felt God wanted him to invade Iraq; if we hadn't toppled Hussein's regime, the rebuilding on the scale described in the OT and in Revelation would not be possible; Hussein would not have been able to do it.  So I believe God spoke to President Bush and I feel sorry for him because he's so mocked for following God's command.<br>  <br>  I believe that, once the world's economy gets going again, it's quite possible that Babylon's rebuilding will be funded by Dubai and Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  @ Seenotes:  you misunderstand the prophesies.  God said He would destroy Babylon and it will never be rebuilt and it will never be inhabited again.  HOWEVER, these prophesies have NEVER been fulfilled, because to this day, Babylon exists as a city and people still live there.  In fact, Saddam Hussein built one of his palaces there, where he lived with his family.<br>  <br>  @ Bam, please read Jeremiah 50 and 51.  You evidently haven't read the OT Scriptures.<br>  <br>  SECOND EDIT:  Greg H makes an EXCELLENT POINT.  Alexander the Great wanted to build up Babylon and make it his Eastern headquarters.  However, he died in Babylon at age 33 before he could impliment his plans.  Saddam Hussein ALSO wanted to build Babylon into a thriving city again.  He also died before he could do it.  But when we see that the city is being built successfully, we'll know that a major prophecy is being fulfilled.

We will all go on forever, either in the presence of God or the presence of the devil and wicked.  I will give you the verses to help you know a little bit:<br>  <br>  As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one….  Romans 3:10<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  …that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17<br>  <br>  So, when you are ready, you can let Jesus in your heart.  You must repent and ask forgiveness and ask Jesus to be your Savior and Lord of your life.  If you do that sincerely you will be born again.  God bless you and keep you!<br>  <br>  Marcia|`|gdYN39gtaa	Most all Protestant Christians believe in the Holy <br>     Bible and included in it is about the afterlife.|`|iPUhrIhfaa	Christianity=]|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Most of them.|`|AFNiSC6eaa	Most of them believe in an afterlife or some kind of "eternal unending life" such as rebirth or ghosts.

mGfCY4Ytaa	more often that not. there was actually a test done on this. they took a bunch of self-proclaimed straight guys - some that are comfortable or ambivalent toward gay men and some that claim to be homophobic. and they put this measuring device on their penis - it either measured movement or bloodflow. maybe both. but either way it would show up if they were horny. and they showed these guys gay porn. guess which group had more hard ons? the homophobes!!!!<br>  <br>  some homophobic ppl are repressing sexual urges they have toward the same sex. they see those feelings as wrong for some reason and get angry at themselves for feeling that way and take it out on gays that aren't afriad to act on their feelings.

Is it science? Every thing that you and has movement is so because of some force like your fan rotates because of electricity and so on and so forth….<br>  Does quantum physics and science teach you to LOVE?<br>  Can you through science and with all the knowledge you have make someone love? If that’s the case then there would be no divorces because you would be knowing the mechanism. There would be no war because countries through science would cause another country to love them……<br>  Can you explain this phenomenon wherein when the so called scientists began to calculate the number of days the nights this earth has seen. They fell short of one. Can you explain that? (Joshua with the help of God causing the sun to standstill)<br>  <br>  When Charles Darwin himself disowned his theory why do we like OXYMORONS believe it?<br>  <br>  Don’t be so haughty and proud in saying “I know everything” You are being foolish. <br>  <br>  Life is something that cannot evolve from one thing to another.

Many people have forgotten about serious things like 9/11 when we where attacked by terrorists. Obama wants to try to sugar coat everything for the enemy and I don't believe that is very smart. There are many things that Obama is for that I am not. Which is why I didn't vote for him. But terrorism is something you have to hit in the mouth, and hit it hard! If that means war, so be it!

The key component involved is a filter through which they approach the religion. The religion itself is a basic framework which they hold in common but the models are so different that the worldviews are worlds apart. Now, to cut to the quick, evangelicals tend to filter Christianity through a social, political and philosophical Conservatism formed in the political arena. This is why they emphasize small government, personal responsibility, are not passionate about caring for the poor when it comes to government programs and a whole mix of other things.|`|e31499ab54c662a4df8d9ae2be1630f7aa	Sure, it is a nice idea. <br>  <br>  The problem is that twofold.  I do not like the idea of forced socialism.  This is because it can breed laziness and discontent.  There are records of the earlier church having all things in common.  This was by choice and entered into selflessly.  The second reason is the depravity of man.  We are all born evil.  We do not need to be taught to steal or envy or be greedy.  That is the problem greed.  If people are greed socialism can not succeed.
2Hot9EJiaa	If you are a Christian, everything about your life is important to God.  He knows what and who is best for you. Your BF may be a wonderful person, but He may not be the man that God has in mind for you.  There are good things, and then there are best things.  God will ask you to give up something/one you love to find the true love that God has for you- first in Him, and then in others.  Where does it say that having a love and a companion is stronger than being single?  If this were true, Paul would have married.  If you are truly believing that God is telling you to leave your BF- you can be very sure, He has your best interest at heart.  Your bf may not be the person that he wants you to believe he is.  Be very careful though,  God may not truly be telling you think.  The key to knowing is peace- if you don't have peace about this decision, don't jump.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Probably. Love fogs up the mind.

If he's pulling you down in your walk, i.e. putting you in the position of temptation, not protecting your purity, not having a passion for purity himself, then yes, God's will is probably to separate.  Otherwise, if he's just spending a lot of time with you and it's a little bit of a distraction, tell him he's distracting you from God and why.  Distractions from God are gonna happen when you're seeing somebody.  It goes away in time.<br>     The Bible says not to be unequally yoked.

It is a crusade on the tobacco companies. <br>  <br>  The tobacco companies were getting so strong that they can control any government.It was not because of health reason that they start the anti smoking but to cripple their power.

If you do a search on the term Propaganda, you will get a sense that it attempts to explain a false sense of reality or give misconceptions about the product.  <br>      I don't get that "false sense"  or any misconceptions when I think of God's Words.  They have led me to great peace in my life, success beyond measure, a family to enjoy it all with, and an understanding about people and the universe as if it were a 6th sense.  When I tried to stray off the path of God in my earlier days, God would always "Reel" me in back to his side. That's how I came to know the truth of God.  Because you CAN test his Words for us.  You can examine his morality by our own definition of the word.<br>       As for the tobacco industry.  I knew 50 years ago that smoke was not healthy for the lungs, no matter how pleasant and enjoyable and appealing they tried to make it sound.
f8d5b1b2cf6cc3996a13cbe0bd92ccc7aa	Well, I am not pro abortion by any stretch and I don't think that tax dollars should support it.<br>  The woman who had the 8 babies I believe have a moral, ethical, and social responsiblity. Did she make a wise ethical, social, or moral decision? Well, lets take one fact that we know of. She had the babies simply because SHE liked children. Did she consider the long term ramifications of her actions, such as being able to raise productive individuals and care for all their needs? There does not seem to be evidence to support that idea.<br>  Now, I would wonder where she came up with the money to have IVF if she has no Job, which implies no income? Was the doctor playing experiment? This seems probable since the Doc's actions went against medically recognized procedures.<br>  <br>  As for tax dollars going toward raising her children; well, that's a complicated issue. You see, the children are here now and if they don't recieve the proper care, then its more probable that they will become a menace to society rather than a productive member. While I don't believe that the children should suffer, I think the mother should not be or feel enabled because society suppports her children and should bare some form of resposibility for her actions.<br>  <br>  I think that tax dollars for sex education is good.|`|118h96Q8aa	That woman had embryos implanted into her. It wasn't like she accidentally had Octuplets. She had them on purpose. Regardless, yes, it was her right to decide this. I just don't think it was a wise decision to bring 8 more children, on top of the 6 she all ready had, into the world when she didn't even have the means to support them. It's not fair to the taxpayers and it's not fair to the children. <br>  <br>  Still, I repeat, it was her right.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	Every mother has some right to decide what to do with her body.  She can exercise, eat nutritious food, and get restful sleep.  Or she can stuff herself with candy and potato chips, lie around watching TV, and have her face pierced and tattooed.  However, she can't decide to become addicted to cocaine, chop off her hand, or sell her essential organs on eBay.<br>  <br>  Her rights over her children are much more limited. No mother has a right to kill her child.  Regardless of the usurping edicts of recent courts, the right to life is an endowment of the creator.  Governments can either secure this right or neglect to secure it, but no government can take away the right to life. It is inalienable.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, I think a women has a right to decide for a body and have an abortion if her life is in danger, or any circumstances that will jeopardize her well being.And about the women with all of the kids, i feel for them because they need all of the help they can get.

I think women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want too.  God gives them that choice.  In my opinion it is like murder and no one should get an abortion.  But women should be able to make that choice for themselves I think.  On second thought abortion should be illegal.  If murder is illegal than abortion should be illegal.  If I killed a two year old I would be considered the worst person ever.  But if a woman kills an unborn child it is OK?|`|eBKJRmEgaa	The woman you are talking about had IVF with six embryos implanted (no more than two or three is the norm) despite the fact she didn't have a job, she lived with her parents who had filed for bankruptcy and already had six children - she should never have been given IVF to begin with. Not to mention, having octuplets is extremely dangerous and it was probable that none of them would have survived.|`|7aK81hsbaa	your question is intentionally misleading and bigoted. no one should decide what  a woman does with her body except the woman herself, hence it's none of your business!|`|AA11297267	Why is it always men who ask this question?<br>  <br>  I think octomom was very irresponsible -- but it was her choice, not mine.<br>  I know that abortion is legal, so it's every woman's choice, not mine.<br>  <br>  Yes, tax dollars are OK for abortion and for sex-ed in schools.  And if octomom qualifies for food stamps or welfare or other tax-funded programs, she'll receive them.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	I believe it is a woman's choice to have an abortion or not.  However in the case of the woman with the octuplets it shouldn't have even come to that.  The doctor should not even have considered implanting her with six embryos given the known circumstances.  I think this doctor was just thinking about the money and the notoriety.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	She's going to end up losing those kids, just you watch. There is no way an unwed, non-working woman, who has already put her mother in dept trying to care for the first six, is going to be determined to be able to properly care for all those children. It's all going to get out of hand and fall apart on her.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	1) Calling a fetus a "baby" is begging the question, a fallacy.<br>  2) There is no way she can give the 6 she already has enough attention. That means there are clear victims here. <br>  <br>  Apples and Oranges|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	Well, here's a list for convenience:<br>  <br>  1. That woman that recently bore eight babies paid to have babies put in her, now she needs to pay for the babies that came out of her. I don't like how the tax payers have to pay for her, nor do I like how she goes out and gets manicures while she asks for money on her website. She needs to grow up and straighten things out. Of course she has a reproductive right to them, but because she chose to bore them (as opposed to a selective abortion, narrowing down the number of embryo's), she needs to take that responsibility of bringing them into this world.<br>  <br>  2. 100% agree, yes tax dollars should be put into Sex Education in schools. I feels as though so many teenage and unintended pregnancies could be prevented just by the knowledge obtained in those classes.<br>  <br>  3. I'm pro-choice. Women should have the right to what goes on in their bodies, period. In no way is a choice of abortion for another woman my choice, and I feel as though it should be no one else's choice but the pregnant woman. I'm not sure where to put tax dollars in relation to abortion, but the money should be put towards aborting pregnancies particularly involving rape, incest, the potential death of the mother, or the possibly painful life of the child.|`|v7Wflu78aa	You are talking about two things:<br>  <br>  1) Yes, women have the right to have abortions<br>  <br>  2) No, killing babies is wrong<br>  <br>  If you think a fetus is a baby, do you think an 85 yr old is a corpse?<br>  <br>  Is a motorcycle a car?  Is an acorn an oak tree?<br>  <br>  I apologize if English is your second language:  A fetus is not fully a baby until it is born.  So abortions are not killing babies.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	I am not in favor of abortion for MYSELF but I will not tell another woman what to do with her body.  <br>  <br>  The woman with 8 babies is a different story entirely.

You have to take it by faith in order to understand.  Read this:<br>  <br>  Simply Believe <br>  February 21, 2009 By Joyce Myer <br>  <br>  We who first hoped in Christ {who first put our confidence in Him, have been destined and appointed to} live for the praise of His glory! Ephesians 1:12 <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ In the world, you don't believe anything until you see it. When you pray, believe that you receive, and you will get the manifestation of it. In God's kingdom you have to believe it first, and then you see it. <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ Jesus said, "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer" (Matt. 21:22 NIV). God's ear is turned towards those who pray to Him in faith. Peter was the only one who walked on water besides Jesus, but he was also the only one who got out of the boat. Until you make a decision to believe, and then act on it, nothing will happen.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	You guys ask this question about a zillion times a week. The Bible is an unfolding narrative. All narratives depend on conflict and (apparent) contradiction -- it's what makes them interesting to read. But those conflicts and contradictions are all resolved at the end -- which is why the end is called the resolution. You guys treat the Bible as if it were some list of doctrines - as if it were a law text or a catechism -- when it's a narrative. If you have such a difficult time understanding narratives, you might check out an "Introduction to Literature" course at the local community college, and they'll help you learn how to read narrative texts. I know that many of you may find that exceedingly difficult, but there's hope, even for those, because most local school boards offer remedial reading, sometimes even as a night-school class. Just so that you and your atheist buddies know...|`|gKHgJJIwaa	Do your own internet research, the answer is there!<br>  <br>  I have not found a contradiction that held up to examination.<br>  <br>  Also note, all critical doctrines remain intact with 100+ solid verses to support them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://groups.myspace.com/BibleContradictions2" rel="nofollow">http://groups.myspace.com/BibleContradic...</a>|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Bible contradictions is rather a large subject to deal with here. It depends on the text. Remember The Bible is a very complex book written over 1,500 years by 40 different writers. It wasn't dictated by God. <br>  If you are really that interested many websites have dealt with it already. The site below will go through them with you. <br>  <a href="http://kingdavid8.com/Contradictions/Home.html" rel="nofollow">http://kingdavid8.com/Contradictions/Hom...</a><br>  Do you think that through 2000 years of Christianity the subject wouldn't of been dealt with already. You make the mistake equating being ‘religious’ with some form of stupidity and the non-religious as somehow intellectually superior.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I think you can be a Christian and not believe in a literal translation. I remember being a kid and reading some passage about God telling them to be nice to their slaves and I was like "wha...isn't slavery bad?" I don't think it's all or nothing. Harold Kushner said something that stuck awhile back. It was like you don't love your mother because she is objectively the best mother in the world, you love her because she is yours. Why would you drive 30 miles to have dinner with her when there are so many nice old ladies in your own town? I realize religion isn't exactly the same thing, but I think it's relatable. That's why people who are very attached to the catholic religion use birth control, etc. It's not because they have looked objectively at every religion in the world and decided it's the best one, it's because it belongs to them and has a place in their heart. Yes, I realize you disagree with me, but hopefully you can look at it from a different point of view.|`|mOaG5ueZaa	Your question and this website are not impressive. It is an atheist lie, or uneducated argument, that the Bible contains contradictions. The Bible in its original texts was inerrant. Unfortunately, we don't have the original texts any longer, but we have more manuscript evidence than *any* ancient text, so we know within a 99.95% accuracy what the original texts said. However, the translations are not perfect, and are certainly not inspired (only the original texts were). I am not going to sit here and explain every alleged "contradiction", however in the case of numbers, it's quite easy to see how a scribe either midread a certain number, or added a zero, whatever the case was.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	The Bible is an anthology of dozens of ancient Near Eastern writings produced by dozens of authors over several centuries. Why would anyone expect it to be free of conflicts?<br>  <br>  But the word "contradiction" is actually incorrect here, and most of the lists of supposed "contradictions" are utter baloney, and presuppose a strict fundamentalist understanding of the Bible.|`|4b0017b6f1d17e1bc52f602c5a3f0a30aa	Contradiction? Or is it that you are contradicting to yourself?<br>  <br>  Do you have commonsense? You can see that all the reference given is contradicting itself.<br>  <br>  Aww cmon fool, you never will understand the Bible even if you try.<br>  <br>  Hey don't kid around! You are a liar to say you were raised a Christian. If you said that you were raised by the Devil, I would have believe you for once.<br>  <br>  It was all answered, fool. (www.carm.org/bible.htm)|`|9oCrDNe2aa	When the Bible was translated, the words sound a little different, but essentially have the same meaning.<br>  <br>  The point of view is biased. You can't just look at the side of the atheist website. Of course they're going to come up with every little reason to disprove the Bible, however stupid it may be.<br>  <br>  The Bible didn't say "And God created man and woman at the SAME time. It just said He created man and woman...<br>  <br>  Many people have studied the Bible for thousands of years.<br>  It would have been changed or edited if these were legit reasons and the Bible was false.<br>  <br>  You can't understand it if you don't have the heart to learn. Not everything was literal in the Bible. Some of it was figurative, and metaphorical. But God gives understanding to those who seek Him.<br>  You can't just take bits and pieces out of the Bible. That's like taking little sound bytes out of a taped conversation, and putting them in random order. It doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  That's from a 13 year old. And don't think you're wiser because you've lived longer. Someone can be blind and not know it because they've never known what it's like to see. Just because you've been taught lies all your life doesn't make it the truth.<br>  Things that have been predicted are happening today, and have happened. <br>  <br>  But people will be stubborn and ignore what is right in front of their eyes. People are quick to fall into cults and other "religions" or put their faith in people, but for many their hearts are hardened and they mock God, or believe in tolerance and "coexisting".<br>  We shouldn't be violent, and should obey the 10 commandments (Thou shall not kill, steal...etc..) Because when we do not teach and obey them, there is chaos. We just can't do everything on our own. You think the world would be a better place, but it wouldn't.<br>  The world is not a perfect place. Cain killed his brother. But it's not a myth like where Cain goes up and lives as a constellation in the sky because Zeus rewarded him.

cb41f4e9fe3dc15f10b1d4abbbbdaa19aa	It seems to me your original question is a mere side thought to the real issues that you are having. <br>  <br>  Here is my break down, take it for what it is worth... Just words on the internet. <br>  <br>  He says he respects your believes, do you respect his ?   One has to be able to respect the other believes enough to know, that they are not going to change them. One also must not think they can change the other one.<br>  <br>  You also need to know how to talk about the subject.  you both have to be able to talk about it openly, again with the knowledge that the other's view isn't going to change.  It is important to know where each other is coming from.   <br>  <br>  There also seems to be a problem in regards to skin color.  Again, if you are comfortable with it, he should be as well.  Sit down and talk to him, and if you are truly not bothered by it, you should let him know, you show him.  That way there will be no questions about it.<br>  <br>  Is he Mr. Right ?   To be honest, I feel there is no so called Mr. Right.  There are those we are more compatible with on a mental, physical and emotional level.   But firstly you need to be able to get past the bigger issues ( Religion, skin color ) first, once those are dealt with then you can sit down and answer if he is the one that makes you happy. <br>  <br>  A good father can be a horrible husband, a horrible husband could be a great father, a husband could be both or neither.  The only way to know is for him to be your husband.  But honestly before you answer that, you both need to think long and hard about your relationship, and where you see it going in the next 5..10...15...20 years.   <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|3yk9rcCUaa	be firm on ur beliefs.<br>  judge him for what he is now and not what he might change to in future.<br>  He may be finding someone to help him in looking after his daughter.<br>  think before u commit to a relationship|`|eBKJRmEgaa	What exactly is wrong with this guy, then?|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	"Can a good father be a good Husband?"<br>  <br>  Of course.

If he treats his daughter well and takes care of her, then that is a true sign of good character. As for the religious issues, I think this is a HUGE thing. Although I think people should be open minded about things, it could cause a lot of problems down the road. For instance, if you two decide to have children, will they go to church? If so, will the dad go with them? When your child goes to him and asks him a question about the Bible, and he's honest saying he doesn't believe it, are you going to like that? However, whether or not he could be mr. right, is your decision. It sounds like you still have a lot of doubts, so I don't think you should rush into anything. I think down the road, the religious differences are going to cause a lot more problems, and the fact that you mentioned that in your question, shows that you aren't completely indifferent about this fact. I'm not saying you don't accept him, but I think a small part of you is still conflicted with this idea. You should not marry someone because he "could be mr right." Anyone could be. You need to be absolutely sure of it. Good luck with everything. I hope I helped.|`|ekTtIliKaa	Ok, I'm not a religious person, yet not an atheist... but here's my opinion<br>  <br>  He sounds like a really good guy, and if he is a really good father it is likely he would be a good husband. Not 100% but very likely. A lot of times it's the same issues that make one not very good at either. And you know he's good with kids!<br>  <br>  I think that judging people by their religion (or lack of) is little different then by race or sex, and you already said you had no problem with his race. I hate to see people that limit themselves because of religion.<br>  <br>  NOW, I am not saying you need to change yourself either, or to think of God any less, it is what you believe in and what you are comfortable with.<br>  <br>  What you should be asking yourself is, are you two in love? Does he treat you and others right? if so, religion should not come between you as long as he continues to respect your religion. Then you should respect his choice to reject religion.|`|uegmmnOpaa	Do not settle!  If he were the one you would not be on here asking us if he was.  He may be a nice man, doesn't mean you should marry him.  Religious beliefs go deeper then just what you do with your Sunday morning.  I am also not racist but each race has certain aspects that differ from each other.  Anyone can get along with anyone but it doesn't mean a lasting marriage.  I think if you go slow you will find that when times get tough your and his core instincts are going to differ greatly.  How you were raised and what you believe deep down like god influence many things, I don't think you and he have enough commonalities to last.  Once this curiosity and admiration for his fathering skills wear off what is going to be the glue that binds you.  If you believe in your God enough to ask him to send you Mr. Right then have faith enough he will make it known that he has delivered.  Do not marry this man hoping to bring him to God.  You can lead people onto the path of the Lord without marrying them if you feel it is you duty to do so.

Unwin sought to prove that the traditional monogamous model for marriage was not essential to the maintenance of a healthy society.  After studying 86 different cultures, across time and continents –and much to his surprise — he came to the inescapable conclusion that the traditional male-female monogamous model for marriage was indeed the best foundation for a healthy and productive society.<br>  <br>  Unwin found that societies that adopted this model typically took about three generations to reach their peak of productivity and progress.  After that, frequently, a gradual development of complacency and licentiousness would take place and what he described as an ”outburst of homosexuality” would sometimes occur.  When that happened, and the society started to move away from the traditional model of male-female monogamous marriage as its foundation, it would begin to unravel.  It would then take another three generations of deterioration from that point for the society to collapse...|`|ZvmwnLlfaa	Depends on what you mean by miracle.

Mark and Luke wrote their gospels to Gentiles<br>              1) To avoid possible misunderstanding by non-Jewish <br>                 readers, they worded the disciples' questions to reflect<br>                 what the discourse is actually about<br>              2) I.e., the destruction of the temple and the sign when<br>                 its destruction would be imminent

A lot of them saw how many other things their religion opposed that were allowed to occur in the past 8 years because they voted for the "pro-life" politicians. Some of them are now prioritizing and deciding which of their stances are more important because they've seen the dangers that come from voting on one single issue.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Yes.

That's not the point.  Are you suggesting that because Roe is the law of the land, we should just shrug and move on?  Perhaps you are.  But if someone believes that abortion-on-demand as a "choice" is wrong -- intrinsically evil -- then it makes no sense to vote for someone who supports it, if there's an alternative, just because this particular Supreme Court ruling is in place and unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future.  The Supreme Court defines law, but legal doesn't necessary mean right.  So we vote according to our consciences, like any citizen, and if that means being castigated as a "single issue voter" then so be it.  <br>  <br>  During this last election I can recall hearing several people express a "single issue", other than this one, which drove their decisions to vote for a particular candidate.  In many cases their vote wasn't particularly well-thought out at all.  But I don't recall hearing them challenged or lectured about casting their vote based on a broader range of issues, or something of more substance than a candidate's personal charm.  In the endless game of semantics that surrounds the abortion issue, it seems that "single-issue voter" is just another code phrase for "pro-lifer".|`|AA11796124	<<Is it foolish to support a political candidate for president based on their abortion stance?>><br>  <br>  Not at all foolish. I mean, who IN THEIR RIGHT MIND is going to elect a president who believes in the legal murder-on-demand of unborn human beings?<br>  <br>  With that in mind, it's not unreasonable for the abortion issue alone to be enough to sway someone's vote hopefully away from the candidate.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<There's not much they can do about the issue. If a supreme court justice dies or retires, they can appoint someone that they think will vote the way they want, if the case comes up before the court.>><br>  <br>  Once a case with a given legal concept has been tried, the Supreme Court doesn't ever go back and "change it's mind".<br>  <br>  Sometimes it can appear to "change it's mind" but only because a given issue may have been revisited BUT from an entirely different legal angle.<br>  <br>  In order for the Supreme Court to overturn Row-v-Wade, the abortion issue would have to come up again BUT from a totally different and legally unprecedented angle. The odds of that are, well, very slim.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<And Roe v Wade has become bigger than abortion,>><br>  <br>  This is a rhetorical statement.

And I thought the great cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 12:1 were physically dead but spiritually alive saints?<br>  <br>  The confused people we are surrounded by today are very much alive, as this Site demonstrates! Perhaps the weight we need to cast off is the weight of sin (as opposed to 'so great a weight of glory' that the saints have). There's a lot more to sin than just legalism. It demonstrates itself even when we are not trying to keep any laws! Running the race is a moving steadily towards eternal glory; although it's not the same as fleeing from the wrath to come (which is a turning to Christ) it does result in not being judged in wrath. We know we're running the race correctly when all that we do results in glory to God.|`|UR4mWefGaa	The question is?|`|iHDYncuXaa	Is there a question in this?|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Sounds like Jabberwocky to me.

So there are a lot of references paralleling what we need to do as Christians to achieving great athleticism.  And in this verse he is saying that we are being watched by many Christians to see how well we will do so get rid of any sins we have that may get us into trouble with the people who are judging our ability to spread the Gospel of Christ.
iHDYncuXaa	The devil is trying to take you down by having you doubt your salvation. He knows God has you and Satan is tormented with the fact he lost you to his "enemy". He's losing his armies and it's really killing him. As you will notice with all new Christians, you are the ones that Satan loves to torment the most. Because you are new in your faith, you don't know the Word yet. Read the bible as much as possible and you'll see him fleeing before long. Meanwhile, you can always rebuke the demons in Jesus' name. God Bless!|`|AA11232725	Here's how the Devil works...<br>  <br>  Genesis 3:1  Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, "Has God indeed said, ...<br>  <br>  Romans 10:8  But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:  9  That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  10  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.  11  As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame."<br>  <br>  Believe in what God says and don't listen to the lies of the deceiver, in Jesus' name, amen.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	This is an act of faith:<br>  Fasting.<br>  <br>  When I wanted to nail stuff down between me and God, I fasted. I continued to pray, and prayer means talking, talking to God. Like He is right there with you (He is).<br>  <br>  Read your Bible during those times, but put aside your fleshly desires (it's too hot, it's too cold, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, I wanna go shopping, etc, etc, etc, ).<br>  <br>  You don't have to do this for days or hours. Get that part out of your mind. All you are doing is setting up the habit of fasting. <br>  <br>  Fasting is telling your body that it needs to shut up for a while. It's time for the spiritual things for a while. Even if you start with 15 minutes, you will benefit from it. You may work up to more time, but get used to it first.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't be like taking a timeout for something you did wrong, so begin slowly, and work into it.<br>  <br>  Matthew 6<br>  16 "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. 17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."<br>  <br>  God bless you, I am rooting for you.<br>  <br>  Prayer done.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Read Romans 8:1 and meditate on that, the devil will attack a new believer all the time , because he wants to confuse you , God is not the author of confusion...keep reading your bible and get help from your pastor or any of the ministers at the church that you belong to, they will help you...keep hanging in there and speak back to the devil when he gets in your thoughts...tell him what Romans 8:1 says, and he will have to leave you alone...God bless you ...|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Believing is a journey.

Even if you aren't able to quote scripture like Jesus did, but that doesn't mean you can't just tell him what you think of him.<br>  <br>  Also, when you start to feel negative things, just start praising God, telling Him how much you appreciate what He's done and how good He is. <br>  No, God doesn't need His ego stroked, but the devil HATES to be around anyone who praises God.<br>  The more you want to get rid of the devil, the more you want to talk about how great God is.|`|d3ac39dc206f4be0d8fd3fd39a087fe8aa	Ask Jesus to also fill you with the Holy Spirit. This will seal you, the Holy Spirit is like God's seal on you.

Let me help you, it will get easier and if you did mean it then you will start to act it. Like James said, "I will shew thee my faith by my works." (James 2:18) For the ultimate showing of faith look at 1 Cor 13, it talks about what a true disciple of Christ will have, charity.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	You will be hurt here for only sinners gather here and many speak lies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please don't expose yourself here but seek someone you can trust who has become  a sinless saint by believing in the heavenly gospel of the water and the Spirit.|`|TbZeLX6laa	The prayer doesn't save. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation!  It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!  Saved, period!  :)|`|xxijbx4Waa	just keep studying your bible,and the lord will continue to cultivate your walk,and increase your knowledge and understanding....which will increase your faith and wisdom.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Please do continue to pray. One thing to pray for is for God to show you you the right way to worship him. Pray specifically for Him to reveal the truth to you. He draws people to him through his son that is true. Doubts are sure to plague many of us until we are sure we have found the correct way to worship him. Do not listen to those who tell you it is ok to worship God just any old way anybody wants to. This is misleading and false. Jesus said on the Sermon on the Mount that the road to life was narrow and cramped and few are the ones finding it. see Matthew 7:13-23 Most were and are on the road leading to destruction. That is why it is of the utmost importance for you to pray for the right religion to be revealed to you that is acceptable to him. In the scriptures above you will note that he condemned some for claiming to worship him but he says get away from me. They are ones not doing the will of Jesus' Father as Jesus notes in those verses.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Hi Sister, welcome to the kingdom!<br>  As soon as someone gets saved, the great deceiver will start to put doubt into your mind.<br>  Please know that you now have power and dominion over him. Tell the devil to get behind you.......in Jesus name. He has to go. The stronger you get the more he will come at you, but, the beautiful thing is, it won't bug you as much. Just keep your faith strong. Read Eph. chapter 6, starting at verse 10. It's putting on the armor of God. Do that ever day and tell people about this so they can pray for you. Get together with friends at church. Corporate prayer is very powerful.<br>  God bless you and thank the Lord we have another soul in the kingdom go God!
A8LCP4Bkaa	I used to believe that reason and factual evidence would eventually sway most of them.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this does not seem to be working, as Fundamentalists (like cult members) see any evidence to the contrary of thier insane beliefs as "the work of Satan".<br>  <br>  Now, I'm beginning to believe that the only cure is high-velocity buckshot, or "45 caliber asprin"....<br>  <br>  as for IRev. Albert Einstein's false quotes, here's some REAL quotes from the Founding Fathers: <br>  <br>  George Washington, in the Treaty of Tripoli: As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.<br>  <br>  Washington, again: All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it were by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson: Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their "legislature" should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between church and State. <br>  <br>  Benjamin Franklin: I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absenteed myself from Christian assemblies.<br>  <br>  James Madison: What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson: And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerve in the brain of Jupiter. But may we hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away with this artificial scaffolding, and restore to us the primitive and genuine doctrines of this most venerated reformer of human errors.<br>  <br>  Thomas paine: All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. <br>  <br>  Article Six of the United States Constitution provides that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States".|`|xo4iux9gaa	I guess you'll have to start with all the founding father's.<br>  <br>  " It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible". - George Washington<br>  <br>  " The Bible is the cornerstone of liberty". -- Thomas Jefferson"<br>  <br>  "That Book (the Bible), sir,  is the Rock on which our Republic rests". - Andrew Jackson<br>  <br>  "It is God who gave us life and liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed the conviction that these liberties are a gift from God?" - Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  "It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God and to obey His will". -- George Washington<br>  <br>  "God in His Providence has given us a Christian Nation...and IT BEHOOVES US TO PREFER AND SELECT CHRISTIANS TO RULE OVER US". - John Jay ...First Chief Justice of  Supreme Court of the United States.|`|TinNG7k7aa	Just expose people to reality.

PvgZUzHjaa	That's why the first religions historically -- and probably pre-historically, too -- were sun worship.  It totally makes sense.

A very small star.  It is a very small star that is part of a very small solar system.  This very small solar system is one of thousands of solar systems in the milky way galaxy.  the milky way galaxy isn't a very big galaxy either...  They're are many, many galaxys.  <br>  Your question asks, is the sun God? I say no.  For the Universe to be created, there has to be a creator, not just a tiny star in huge universe.  <br>  God created the universe and everything in it.  including the sun.  Without the sun we wouldn't exist, and that is why God put it at exactly the right distance from our earth.|`|WifkEh18aa	Sure you have a point there. But think of this in another way. If you worshiped the Sun, believed it would always be there when you prayed to it, then what would you do when the Sun sets? It isn't always there. Sure it doesn't completely disappear or turn to nothing, but still it's not always there. The same thing's there with the Moon. If you thought of it as your god, it would still go away when the Sun rises. I'll give you an example. Say what you want about it, but it's true. <br>  Let me take you back more than 2000 years ago. . .<br>  Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), when he was young, didn't believe in the stone idols the Arabs worshiped in those days. The people also believed in the Sun, the Moon, the Stars etc.<br>  One night, whilst watching the stars shining in the sky, he told the people, "I will worship the brightest star." The people were quite happy thinking that at last Ibrahim was beginning to follow their beliefs. But slowly when that star became dim and the Moon came out, Ibrahim said, "Oh no. I can't worship a star that dims! I'll worship the Moon."<br>  Again, when the Moon set, and the bright Sun came up, Ibrahim said, "Oh this is far bigger and brighter than the Moon. I'll make this my god!" But when, at sunset, the Sun disappeared as well, he turned to his people and said, "Oh, my people! If my God hadn't shown me the right way, I might have gone astray!"<br>  And since then, Ibrahim believed in the One and true God. One who cannot be seen but exists. For if there were more gods, they would always keep fighting and competing amongst themselves.<br>  I hope you understand now. I've made my point clear. And if you really are religious, you will not just ignore this.<br>  Hope you heed my words.<br>  P.S. If you've been keeping track of the latest news, you might know that scientists have discovered that the Sun is dimming. It is losing its light (very slowly) and one day it will be just like the Moon, a huge body in space which does not have its own light (since the Moon shines only because the light from the Sun is reflected onto it). Judgment Day is coming.<br>  P.P.S. There is a God. One God. One whom you cannot see, but still exists. Believe me.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	"Homage to thee, O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra,<br>  thou restest upon law unchangeable and unalterable. <br>  Thou passest over the sky, and every face watcheth thee and <br>  thy course, for thou hast been hidden from their gaze. <br>  Thou dost show thyself at dawn and at eventide day by day."|`|zPfgFXU5aa	Except that the Sun has no ability to create life or to create the Universe it inhabits, the sun is itself a created thing and without whoever or whatever made it, the sun would not exist.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	From what I know about ancient cultures, the sun was almost definitely the "first" "god".|`|EczLqAIKaa	What?

It never ceases to amaze me how someone can come on here ranting about someone "imposing" their views on others, and at the same time are doing it themselves. Isn't that what you call a hypocrite??<br>  <br>  My son was born 10 weeks early. He was in an incubator for 2 months because he needed extra care. He weighed a little over 2 lbs. There were MANY babies in that NICU that were born even earlier. They weighed like 1 lb.  I know a little about premature babies.  They aren't suppose to be born yet, but sometimes that happens. Those littlest babies were still BABIES. They cried and everything, so don't tell me what they are. Many of them still make it, and grow up to be wonderful people. My son is 19 years old now. He is an intelligent young man who is going to college to be a Doctor. To think that someone would rip a child out of a womb when they are alive, sickens me. God is going to judge those who would have anything to do with this, and if you voted for it, you are just as guilty as the one who rips that babies body out. <br>  You tell it to those parents of those tiny 1 lb babies. You tell them that they were not babies, that they were "just a mass of cells."    God have mercy on you!<br>  <br>  Guess where all those aborted BABIES are now, "proud atheist?"

Right because if you honestly believe that you are not killing someone then you are obviously or should be ok with the fact that your own mother could have killed a fetus not a person.<br>  Children don't ask to be brought here ,but if they are then let them decide either they want to live or die because just cause person is in a vegetative state does that give you the right to just go ahead an kill them. Heck cause they after all are born, but like babies, oh excuse me fetus's, have no voice. Then we should kill everyone who can't fend fort themselves.

f9fmvB9gaa	I think so. I think a lot of people cling to religion because of the fear of not knowing what happens after we die. They want to believe so badly that there is something afterwards, something better and that good people get rewarded while bad people get punished. Also, not knowing WHY we are here, religion gives people a reason to keep on going everyday. The thought that we are just here because of some random chance event and then evolved over billions of years for no reason doesn't sit well with people. People need something to believe in, and faith in God and religion keeps them going. I think the fear of not believing forces people to have faith--"If I don't believe in God...I run the chance of going to hell so I better believe..." **Not for me, but that's just a small portion of my view of God and religion**|`|9OuOUZLAaa	if people do not know something they can not fear it. <br>  it is the knowledge of knowing there is an unknown and not being able to know what it is, that people fear.  <br>   is it a cornerstone to faith? no. it is the foundation of progress, to overcome the unknown.|`|2TavF36Daa	Faith is:<br>  <br>  believing what can not be seen.

bVHnNqzBaa	Atheists such as myself realize that every situation is unique and requires a response suitable for that particular situation. We are not blindly rigid in our beliefs or actions.<br>  <br>  Morals come from socio-culturing, parents, peers, and life experience.<br>  <br>  Many Christians claim that only those who believe can live a moral life and those who do not believe in god have no moral compass. That implies that one lives a moral life, not because it is the right thing to do, but because god expects us to be moral. Again, the fallacy with this reasoning is that mitzvahs and morals should be followed because god or a holy book dictates rules to us and not for personal philosophical or spiritual reasons.<br>  <br>  Whose morals are based upon a stronger footing?<br>  <br>  ATHEISTS - who have an intrinsic sense of positive and negative behaviors and actions, understanding that each situation is unique and calls for flexible rules and reasoning. Atheists possess an internal compass – call it a golden compass -- to help guide them toward positive and negative outcomes. Atheists possess great courage by taking a stand on something they comprehend, not some set of rules blindly followed.<br>  <br>  BELIEVERS - who would have no sense of morality in absence of god or bible. Believers whose only sense of morality comes from an external source yet possess no internal compass to guide them through life. Believers who have to constantly ask, "What would Jesus do" because they are completely devoid of internal sense making or judgment. Believers only have a book to point to for their beliefs.<br>  <br>  From responses I've seen in R&S, some Christians are jealous of us, believing we atheists are getting away with something. That we get to live a life without morals and then don't have to suffer the consequences. Not sure by what irrational logic they arrive at that conclusion. As an atheist I am moral, kind, and selfless because it is the right way to live. I have no expectation of any reward for proper living. Wouldn't a true Christian be good in absence of salvation, or are they only good to be saved?<br>  <br>  EDIT: By the way, the Hammurabi Codex predates your Bible by about 1700 years.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Society makes rules.

His name was Joe Smith and he claimed he was visited by an angel who told him the location of golden plates buried in the ground with another biblical text written in an old language on them. He claimed he translated these golden plates and wrote the translation in the ‘Book of Mormon.’ He then claimed an angel took these golden plates to heaven when he finished translating them. During the translation, he claimed the golden plates were in his hat along with some magical rocks and he hid behind a curtain and talked aloud whilst holding his face in his hat and a guy who owned a printing press wrote down what he said. A lot of what Joe claimed was new biblical scripture was actually taken from the Old Testament. Here’s a link explaining the connection: <a href="http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomnames.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomn...</a><br>  <br>  Now if you think this is weird; wait, it gets worse! What this Joe Smith claimed was written on these golden plates was that Native Americans are descendants of a lost tribe of Hebrews that somehow made it from the Middle East to the Americas over 2000 years ago. He claimed they founded civilizations and fought wars with each other and apparently Jesus even visited the Americas. DNA evidence alone proves that what this guy said about Native Americans being descendants of Hebrews is nonsense. There has NEVER been any evidence found of pre-Colombian Hebrew civilizations in America. Here’s a link to what the Smithsonian Institute has to say about the ‘Book of Mormon;’ <a href="http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smithsonian-letter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smit...</a> <br>  <br>  It's also a well established fact that before Mormonism came to be, Joe Smith used to trick people into thinking he could find buried treasure by holding a crystal up to his eye then putting his face in a stovepipe hat and receiving ‘spiritual information.’ That's the kind of thing Americans used to believe back then. They believed there was Spanish treasure buried all over the place and scammers like Joe Smith, who learned the trade from his parents, roamed around like carnies looking for gullible people, and in the USA, there was no shortage of gullible people...some would say, there is still no shortage today. This is how Joe made a living before he concocted the stories that he claimed were on the golden plates that no one else ever saw and convinced a publisher to write down his words.<br>  <br>  Mormons used to practice polygamy and some of them still do but mainstream Mormons try to distance themselves from the polygamous ones. The Mormons who are the most fervent believers of their phony doctrine and do their utmost to spread Mormonism get special treatment in the temples and are rewarded with special underwear which has Masonic symbols sewn into it. Mormons believe this underwear protects them from bullets, fire, knife wounds etc. They have weird ceremonies in their temples and only favored Mormons are allowed access to the temples during these ceremonies. Mormons are expected to give 10% of their gross income to their church; if the church leaders feel as though their members aren’t giving enough of their income to the church, they are interviewed by the church leaders and have to explain their actions. If Mormons leave the church and don’t attend services anymore, they are hounded by other members of the church for a while, then all contact is broken with them and friends and family are discouraged by the church to contact the member who has left.<br>  <br>  Mormons used to be considered a racist cult as well, listed right alongside the KKK. They used to have as part of their doctrine judgment from their god that people with dark skin were cursed folk unequal to white people and people with dark skin weren’t allowed to attain high positions in the Mormon hierarchy. It was during the civil rights movement of the 60’s that the Mormon leaders realized that society had shifted and laws were changed outlawing segregation and discrimination against dark skinned people. The Mormon leaders, each claiming they were prophets of the Christian god, claimed that they had received revelation from this god that the Mormon doctrine had to change to allow dark skinned people better treatment in the Mormon churches. This was a similar occurrence when they had to give up polygamy in order for the Mormon home state of Utah to be granted status as a state; again the Mormon leaders claimed they had revelation from the Christian god outlawing polygamy even though the founders of Mormonism were known polygamists.<br>  <br>  Mormons believe lies; blatant lies. They try to make other people believe their lies too. They are active proselytizers and if you ever encounter a Mormon, it’s almost guaranteed they will try to get you to join their organization and believe the lies that they believe. They claim things like, “Oh, but I am a law abiding person and I have a happy life and a good family and even if my religion is based on untruths, I can live with that because I know it makes me a better person.” Sure, believing nonsense can make people into decent law abiding folk who are good parents, but it’s such a trade off. They trade reason and accountability for an illusion of wholesomeness. They trade intellect and individuality for phony, contrived spirituality. They trade their freakin humanity for delusion!<br>  <br>  If the missionaries were honest, they would tell people right from the start about the weird tenets of the Mormon faith. They would tell them things like the magical underwear with Masonic symbols on them, Jesus going to America, ancient tribes of Jews in America for which no evidence exists, golden plates, seer stones, magical glasses and the 'prophet' reading out his ‘prophecy’ whilst holding his face in a hat. They should tell people that Mormons are expected to “follow the brethren;” this is a term used in the Mormon organization to indicate the importance of Mormons doing as they’re told by their leaders. Of course, if the missionaries blurted out this stuff to everyone they meet, they would scare people away, but anything short of this is inherently dishonest as it’s a clear indication THEY ARE HIDING THE TRUTH TO PERPETUATE A LIE.<br>  <br>  Mormonism as a business; compare it to McDonald’s – they both started in the USA, they both took an existing product, jazzed it up and marketed it in a different way, they have both spread all over the globe, they both recognize the financial benefits of getting children hooked to their product, they both update their menu/doctrine along with societal changes, they both have high paid lawyers on their pay roll, they have both made truck loads of cash, they both make out that they do good in the community, they both have extensive public awareness campaigns, they both act quickly to silence dissenters…and lastly, they both take money from the public and sell them poison and misinformation in return.|`|CLB32006aa	what prophecies has he made that came true?<br>  as for the civil war one, it was going to happen based on the conflict of slave and free states, which was started right at the beginning of the nation and the 3/5ths compromise.|`|WyICbuPqaa	Joseph Smith made many prophecies, and most have been fulfilled.  Here is a short list:<br>  <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_prophecies.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_pro...</a><br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon only makes a few prophecies that hadn't already occurred by Joseph's day.  One was the return of the Jews to Israel, which was also a biblical prophecy; one was a prediction of Joseph himself, similar to the Messiah Ben Joseph prophecies:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_ben_Joseph" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_ben...</a><br>  <br>  Another Book of Mormon prophecy that is worthy of mention, is the prophecy that three witnesses would be called to testify of the Book of Mormon.  This prophecy was literally fulfilled after the Book of Mormon's translation.<br>  "12 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein. <br>    13 And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead. <br>    14 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God! <br>    15 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them. <br>    16 And now, because of the glory of the world and to get again will they say this, and not for the glory of God. <br>    17 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed. <br>    18 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it. <br>    19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned. <br>    20 Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. "<br>  (2 Nephi 27)<br>  <br>  This prophecy is comparable to the prophecy in Isaiah 29:11.<br>  "And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: "<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith was well deserving of the title of prophet.  He is certainly one of the greatest prophets who ever lived.|`|CTxGUFZOaa	To specify Joseph's prophecy concerning the Civil War, Doctrine & Covenants 87:1 states:<br>  <br>  Verily, thus saith the Lord con-<br>  cerning the wars that will shortly<br>  come to pass, beginning at the rebel-<br>  lion of South Carolina, which will <br>  eventually terminate in the death<br>  and misery of many souls;<br>  <br>  This was received in a revelation on December 25, 1832.  It was reaffirmed in another prophecy on April 2, 1843, found in D&C 130:12-13 :<br>  <br>   12 I prophesy, in the name of the<br>  Lord God, that the commencement <br>  of the difficulties which will cause <br>  much bloodshed previous to the <br>  coming of the Son of Man will be in <br>  South Carolina.<br>   13 It may probably arise through <br>  the slave question. This a voice <br>  declared to me, while I was praying <br>  earnestly on the subject, December <br>  25, 1832.<br>  <br>     Confederate forces started the Civil War with an attack on Union forces at Fort Sumpter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861.<br>  <br>     No, this isn't from the Book of Mormon, but it is a prophecy from the Lord through Joseph Smith.  <br>  <br>     The Book of Mormon, in 3 Nephi chapter 29 connects the coming forth of the Book of Mormon to the timing of the restoration of the nation of Israel.  Bible prophecies of the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the Jews was fulfilled by the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and subsequent scattering of the Jews from their lands in about 70 A. D. and after.   Verse 1 states:<br>  <br>   And now behold, I say unto you<br>  that when the Lord shall see fit, in<br>  his wisdom, that these sayings shall<br>  come unto the Gentiles according<br>  to his word, then ye may know that<br>  the covenant which the Father hath<br>  made with the children of Israel, <br>  concerning their restoration to the<br>  lands of their inheritance, is<br>  already beginning to be fulfilled.<br>  <br>     The Book of Mormon was published in 1830.  The Zionist movement which began in the late 1800's for a Jewish return to Israel culminated with the establishment of Israel once again as a nation in 1945.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i have checked many anti mormon allegations of prophecies and studied the sources and citations. All of the allegations are false. <br>  <br>  even if the prophecies were fulfilled in the slightest degree. <br>  <br>  some can be seen to be no fulfilled YET, this is true. but even the book of mormon is Not completely perfect in doctrine, there is still debateable "contentions" of some FEW verses in it.|`|dL82oSHTaa	Joseph was a false prophet, having sex with over a 100 13 yr old girls just to see if there virgins in his so called sealing room. The Mormons were bloody murderer's just to keep there cult alive. You should read your history my friend. There is no prove that he had visions from the lord or from his fake angel. Isaiah  8:20 is the key to any prophet.<br>  <br>  There may be good people in the church now but there doctrines are from the devil and they don't even know it.|`|MVT34FZsaa	There is already so much evidence that he was not the prophet of God.<br>  <br>  He also made another gospel and that is very bad
ylaGS5EHaa	Job (pronounced with the long 'o' I saw someone thinking it was the short one) lost his children, flocks, and home. In other words all signs of earthly riches, but he waited on the Lord. His wife and friends all turned against him and he still waited on the Lord. And eventually the Lord did return to him more than He had taken away. It was a test for Job, more than most of us will ever have to face, but one that he faced with patience. It's a saying for someone who seems to be able to suffer endlessly without giving into despair.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	Job was some guy who allowed God to torture him to the point where he suffered like no other human being... but still loved god.... its a story...... like all the stories in the bible... written by men.... to create desired behavior in the masses...... so basically job is used by christians to say " see.... job endured, you can endure the suffering too... just believe blindly, follow us into the land of fairy tales"<br>  <br>  dont buy into it...|`|borw2oKCaa	I believe its from a bible. It means that when working, doing labor, or a "job" of some sort great patience is required. This could be applied in the typical workers day to day life as to say that life requires patience.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Patience of a saint!|`|OLiH8pSvaa	If something requires the patience of Job, it requires great patience.<br>  <br>  James 5:7-11 and Job 19:1-27, Hebrew bible.|`|j4j8TXSVaa	I think it may refer to the fact that he stayed around for the ending of the tests that Satan was putting him through and found God waiting there to answer all his questions.|`|iIQyGAH6aa	The patience of Job most likely means having patience when performing a task.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	Read the Job and you will see|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Even after Satan ruined his sh*t, he still had faith that God would make things all better.
iHDYncuXaa	Do chickens have lips?|`|FI916ISFaa	Psychics are real people.  They have no psychic ability though.  Some are genuine frauds and thieves while some are just deluded.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	No.|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	I've only met psychics a couple of times in my life and not because I was seeking one out for advice of something, because I wasn't. But both times, it was quite unnerving - they basically listed off what was in my mind and what I had been doing all day. I know no one was following me around all day, and reading my mind ?!?!?  PLEASE. It was scary, but interesting - psychics can be quite useful, but from what I understand, they've gone through some kind of terrible pain that caused them to become psychic... I wouldn't wish becoming psychic on anyone...|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Yes! <br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|nooi0ldjaa	no...just another good money scam..|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Of course not, or they'd win the lottery every week, silly!|`|9yP43Peiaa	No they are not real.

Of course they'e real!  Cats and dogs have such abilities, why not people?<br>  Sensitives:  People who can "sense" energies and other things, like people, emotions, etc. without seeing or hearing them physically.  This IS proven by science, that energies are recepted and transmitted by certian individuals.  proven by thermal imagers, electron scanners, and more.<br>  Clairvoyants:  people with the ability to forsee certian events, or get "feelings" of things happening outside of their own range of vision, hearing, or touch.  The lotto can NEVER EVER be won by a psychic because it's randomly drawn, it's an accidental numerical anomoly based of the "chaos theory" (also proven by science).  So, had you written down the powerball numbers, and traveled backwards through time, they would be re-drawn different, even without altering anything.  Because the randomness is nearly infinite in it's capacity, and a psychic cannot forsee what doesnt exsist.  Chaos doesnt physically exsist, it's just a matter of chance and luck.<br>  DeJaVu falls under the catagory of clairvoyance.<br>  INTUITIVE Psychics...people who have psychology understanding or sometimes degrees, and can alter peoples mind sets by talking to them, sometimes pulling information from their sub-concious mind.  This is a skill in itself, and some people are born with an inborn knack for this skill.  But it isnt quite the same as "psychic" ability...it's just an evolved form of communication with information some people have "forgotten" or "supressed".|`|rCF8UtNTaa	most are frauds, some are hearing spirit guides which are demonic spirits pretending to be good.  Thats why sometimes they can tell you things they shouldnt know.  You have an abilty to communicate with God and he will speak to your heart if your willing to listen.  Psychics will open the door to many wicked things in your life and it will most likely destroy your life as you know it.|`|mnJLWLN3aa	Greetings Miss B,<br>  <br>  TY for this question sweetie.  As you can see there are many different view points here. <br>  <br>  If you mean are the psychics that you pay to go see for real?, well...some just want your money {that was proven by Houdini} & some can really have psychic abilities, yes...& then there are those that have the wicked dark side to them {stay away from those hon}.<br>  <br>  The reasons why pyschics can't stop bad things from happening is because it was already written in the Big Book upstairs darlin...nobody can stop that, or win the lottery easy either.<br>  <br>  I, know that there are people that pick up on things and are in tune with the Universe for a fact, because I am one of those people.<br>  <br>  So, hope this answers your question.

AQBow7Glaa	Yes, according to Christians it's a limited time offer.  <br>  <br>  God runs salvation like an infomercial--you have to call in the next ten minutes to get the special bonus eternity in paradise.<br>  <br>  Seriously, 1 Peter 3:18-22 is usually used by U.S. Protestant doctrine to support the idea that you have to accept salvation while you're still alive.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It's too late once you're dead. If you die as an unbeliever, then you won't even get the chance to see the gates of heaven.  You'll be immediately in hell. <br>  <br>  The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed in Jesus alone in this life or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	once your dead, all hope is gone.

I think in the Old Testament I just made it up to Numbers so tomorrow will be Numbers 1 and 2, and in the New Testament I am near the beginning of Mark.  I am also taking an old testament course on Genesis and Leviticus so I'll read whatever that course has me read too.|`|OQlanljQaa	I will read Genesis again..

3BHPJweWaa	"WHY didnt someone write these gospels immediately after Jesus died?" you asked.<br>  <br>  Matt. 10:23 -- "When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes."<br>  <br>  Luke 21:32 (& Mark 13:30) -- "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all has taken place."<br>  <br>  Mark 9:1 And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."<br>  <br>  There was no NEED to write any of it down if everything in Mark 13: 24-27 was going to happen before everyone listening to Jesus had died -- & if Jesus was returning -- in Power -- within a decade or three at the most.  <br>  <br>  Paul believed the end of the world as they knew it would come during their generation, too -- which is why he recommended people *not* marry -- because there was no marriage in heaven, as the Lord had taught & they should prove to the Lord they were *ready* to join him in Heaven by living unmarried as if they were with the Lord in Heaven, already.<br>  <br>  Well... they were FALSE PROPHECIES, folks!  But those people *believed* them.<br>  <br>  When those prophecies did NOT come true -- & that generation that was alive, then, were dying off... & the "oral traditions" (ie: *gossip*) was getting wilder & further removed from what the (probably already distortive) memories of those who'd been On The Scene remembered, *then* it became necessary to get it written down.<br>  <br>  30 to 60 years later -- those are nothing *approaching* dependable historical records -- when based on what people told other people & the degenerating memories of people from 60 to 90 years *old*!<br>  <br>  MiLady & i had dramatic upheavals in our lives happening to us about 33 years ago.  We *lived* thru it.  i *know* how UNdependable our memories are (in our early to mid 60's) about what happened in our lives in the summer-fall of 1976.  & remember what was actually *said* in those hundreds of thousands of words of conversations that went on amidst a dozen of us, backthen?  Ya gotta be *kidding*!  It would be nothing but a semi-fictional reconstruction, doing our truthful *best*!  (Because i kept a Journal and she kept a Journal, too, *some* moments are recorded shortly after they happened -- & would be, presumeably, accurate.)<br>  <br>  Ask one of my brothers & 2 of my sisters to give an accurate portrayal of the other sister?!  *Impossible* to get any accurate portrayal from them because of their biases.  You'd get nothing *but* horrendous distortions of her reality.  & tho i did my best (i who have been closest to her) i wouldn't be able to do a truly accurate portrayal, either.<br>  <br>  Mom's & Dad's memories about their own lives were slipping, considerably, in their 60's & 70's... & in their latter 70's & early 80's, you couldn't trust much of anything they said anymore... because their minds, relative to *accuracy* of memory, were gone.<br>  <br>  Mary Magdalene having 7 demons cast out of her?  Superstitious *gossip* that never really happened any more than Pecos Bill roped a cyclone & rode it!<br>  <br>  "...take the four New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection and compare them in detail. <...> you'll see that they differ on just about every point.  Who went to Jesus' tomb on the third day after his crucifixion?  Was it Mary alone or Mary in the company of other women?  If there were other women, how many others were there and who were they?  Was the stone in front of the tomb when they arrived, or had it been rolled away?  Whom did the women see there?  Was it a young man?  Two men?  An angel?  What were the women told to do?  Were they instructed to tell the disciples to go to Galilee to meet Jesus, or to stay in Jerusalem to meet him?  How did the women react?  Did they do as they were told, or did they keep silent and not tell, out of fear?  And what then did the disciples do in response?  Did they believe the women or disbelieve them?  Did they check it out for themselves or not?  Did they head up to Galilee or stay in Jerusalem?  And did the women themselves (or Mary herself) have a vision of the resurrected Jesus?  If so, was Mary the first to see him, or was someone else?  And when she saw him, did she grab hold of him or not?" -- Bart Eerdman, pp. 186-7, _Peter, Paul, & Mary Magdalene_. (My book order arrived in the mail, yesterday.)<br>  <br>  And all those contradictions are "God's infallible words," eh?!  <br>  <br>  Now if the oral traditions of fallible memories can't even get what actually *happened* accurately recorded -- is what Jesus *actually* said being remembered with any *more* genuine accuracy!?<br>  <br>  What people hear from others about an accident that happened, locally, two *days* ago is not accurate to the facts.  A tremendous number of distortions enter in when they're not even *intended* -- simply thru mis-hearing & the mind *changing* things.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	yes; they were part of oral tradition and from some of Paul's writings, which predate the Gospels, we can see that stories about Christ and beliefs of the new religion were forming before they were written. The stories were understood by these people as just that: narrative. We should derive from them a basic sense of who Jesus, the character, is but not draw specific conclusions as the literalists do. That is and has proven to be dangerous.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	The Gospels were written by eyewitnesses and first hand accounts from eyewitnesses.  They were not stories "passed around".  Thanks for asking.|`|z74a7wvlaa	The early christians bonded [Acts 2:44-47] shortly after Jesus ascended to Heaven. At the beginning, there was no need to write as the gospels were taught orally but as the gospels spreads outside of Palestine, they start writing so as to preserve the gospels. e.g. the council ask Mark to write all what he heard and learned from St Peter and St Peter approved it. The writers of the gospel were close  associates of Jesus and people who heard or learned from the apostles, from Jesus' relatives.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Sure, and the Jesus myth wasn't the only 'savior story' that was going around at the time.

Then came Matthew and Luke, about 70 AD, both of which were heavy-duty borrowers of whole scenes and phrases from Mark. About 90 AD, John was written, and material from Matthew, Mark, and John were copied extensively. However, look up the "Q" document (which may have existed as a list of sayings and parables) and which might be as early as 40-45 AD. Still, there is nothing from the period 25-35 AD, which would be the time when the historical 'jesus' was living.|`|m9zviqlzaa	what is your source? the gospels were written by people who were either directly involve in Jesus's life, or worked with Jesus's disciples. <br>  it is best to remember that the Bible may have been written by men, but it was composed by God.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	those gospels don't exist either only translated copies.|`|hZVJRW7uaa	Yes, basically.<br>  <br>  Which the problem with atheists, that they have to assume it's completely wrong, because as Chinese whispers, things change.

The field of source-criticism studies which sources went into the four canonical Gospels. The Pre-Markan Passion Narrative, Signs, Q, and early Christian liturgical formulae were all composed within decades of the death of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Also, first century Judea was a highly oral society. Religious teachers frequently formulated their teachings in a format that was easy to remember, and students often passed on immense amounts of information with nearly word-for-word accuracy. The Talmud, for example, is tens of thousands of pages long, and recounts word-for-word conversations and debates from the second temple era. But because Jewish religious teachers frequently discouraged writing things down, the Talmud wasn't put on paper for hundreds of years. Still, Talmudic students often learned the entire corpus by heart.<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that Gospels were apologetic works. Much of what they contain is considered historical simply because they are difficult for the early church to explain. The works are compendium of difficult passages and hard-to-explain events. It is highly unlikely that a single generation after Jesus his followers would have made up a biography that was devastating to the early Christian argument that Jesus was the Messiah.    <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that scholars don't know who wrote the Gospels. The traditional names were appended shortly after the Gospels were written, and were based on oral traditions surrounding the original documents. Scholars are quick to point out that just because the Gospel is attributed to Matthew, that doesn't mean that Matthew wrote it. But it certainly doesn't mean that Matthew *didn't* write it. The authors of the Gospels may have been eye-witnesses, and they may not have been. We simply don't know.

An "acolyte" is an altar assistant, in other words, an altar boy.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	he's right.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Altar boys or sacristans.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13322a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13322a.h...</a>|`|bXeHr69Vaa	they are called altar boys, not alter. also known as acolytes|`|UO9x4Curaa	The Roman Rite of the celebration of Mass, Acolytes have the following responsibilities (depending which type of mass) during<br>  <br>  Mass of the Catechumens <br>  Processional: Acolytes carry the thurible, incense boat, processional cross and candles (flambeaux) in a Missa Cantata. <br>  After the sacristy bells are rung and first genuflection at the high altar, the Acolyte takes the Priest’s biretta, kisses it, and places on the Presidential Chair. <br>  <br>  Altar boys are an important part of the tradition of the Catholic Church as well as other churches such as the Orthodox and Anglican churches. Altar boys appear in the written record as early as 251 AD, meaning that the tradition must have developed even earlier. Altar boys in the early church lived in the church building and dedicated their whole lives to the Church, usually becoming monks and priests. We have very few historical images of altar boys. We do not know what altar boys wore during the medieval era. We know more about altar boy costumes with advent of the Renaissance and the availability of more paintings. We Have some images from the 19th century. Some 19th century images show altar boys wearing caps. We no longer see this in the 20th century. Most images we have found come from the 20 century. <br>  <br>  <br>  The age at which boys serve as altar boys varies somewhat from church to church. One American Orthodox cgurch informs parisioners, "Upon entering the second grade, all boys are invited to become altar boys. The boys are organized into groups which serve, in rotation, at the holy Altar during all worship services. Extracurricular activities are also planned to encourage fellowship, partnership, and teamwork."|`|8IHfytEvaa	They are called "Altar Boys"<br>  <br>  Note the correct spelling above.<br>  <br>  They hold the candles due to the fact that traditions in the Roman Denomination die hard.<br>  <br>  You see years ago, before electricity, they needed Altar Boys to hold those candles so the Priest could see to read.<br>  <br>  Now that we have electricity, they have kept the Altar Boys.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to keep them, except . . . . tradition.|`|YnGIccE8aa	Yes, they are "Alter Boys" but nowadays we call them "Alter Servers" since girls preform the duty too. Their job is to not only help the priest, the liturgist, and the Eucharist ministers -- it's to learn the intricacy of the Mass so that they may discern their future callings. It's also a fine reminder of Jesus' teaching about children being pure of heart.<br>  <br>  (So don't feel like reading Atheist/Anti-Catholic bigotry that's bound to be occurring on this thread so I am just answering without reading other answers.)|`|qOGh6ODLaa	Altar Boys also known as Altar Servers|`|akvrwpywaa	They are called altar servers (or altar boys).|`|zefFTf8Aaa	alter servers|`|shiiRrcoaa	Hi,<br>  They are called altar boys...that's correct.<br>  <br>  P.|`|tqIaTWkHaa	alter boys|`|f1fYwYMVaa	see i am roman and i got to   romancatholicchurch they are called alter boys But if they werent wearing a gown like the preist but white then no they arent the priest will just sometimes call on some boys or sometimes girls to help him out Usually he will call on someone he sees at the church aot of the times
N5Nn1B2daa	answer: No, the temple is not being rebuilt because a mosque sits where the temple stood originally.  There is the hope among the Jewish people the temple will be rebuilt one day when there is world peace.<br>  <br>  The Tanakh is the holy book (containing the Torah). The original Hebrew has been mistranslated or misunderstood from a Christian bias into the OT of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Christians often say it's only a few words that are different but those words change the entire texts and meanings of verses in the Tanakh.  <br>  <br>  Zechariah 12:10 ? The Hebrew Tanakh: “and they shall look upon me whom they have stabbed/ thrust through [with swords”)   The King James Version of Zechariah changes one word [stabbed] to “pierced.” <br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14 ? The Hebrew Tanakh says “Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman (alma) is with child, and she will bear a son and she shall call his name Immanuel.”  **Take note, this was written in the present tense. <br>  But the Greek Septuagint changed “alma,” saying “Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (Matthew 1:22-23). The church changed the entire verse from present to FUTURE tense and then went further to change the Hebrew alma, meaning a young woman to virgin. <br>  <br>  Isaiah 9:5 ? The Hebrew Tanakh reads: “For a child has been born to us, a son has been given us and authority has settled on his shoulders. He has been named “The Mighty God” Isaiah was referring to King Hezekiah, son of Ahaz.  Again, in an attempt to insert a Jesus prophecy, the KJV changed the tense from the present to the future, making it, “A child is born, a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God”. [In Hebrew Hezekiah means “the mighty God.”] <br>  <br>  are some examples|`|rGEZup0Zaa	The Jewish holy scripture is the Tanakh. <br>  <br>  The Torah is only the first five books contained in the Tanakh; the Torah is commonly referred to as the "Five Books of Moses".<br>  <br>  The Tanakh is NOT the same as the Old Testament; the Old Testament is a version of the Tanakh that was altered to conform to a Christian perspective.|`|msNXomjTaa	The Torah (or Law) is basically the first 5 books of the Bible - the Pentateuch.  Jews also have the Prophets, Wisdom, and the Psalms, all also in the OT, and also recognized as Scripture by Christians.  There are a few OT books not accepted by Jews, namely the ones written in Aramaic, not Hebrew.  These date to around 300-150 BC.  Most are part of what is known as the Apocrypha, or Duetro-Canonical books.  These are books beyond the 66 books of the Bible that are accepted by some denominations (notably Roman Catholic, but also Anglicans and others) as part of the Bible, but not by others, notably fundamentalist denominations,.<br>  <br>  Jews also have the Midrashes.  These books extend the stories in the original books, with lots of interpretations, and more details.  There are two main types, one from the Jews who were in Babylon, and one from those who stayed in the Holy land.  They are different, but comparing them can be interesting, especially when studying a particular OT passage.  I have forgotten the actual names of them, but saw some passages while studying Theology in university.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	There's the Torah, which is basically the Pentateuch; the first five books of the Bible.  Then there's the Talmud, which is what Jewish scholars study.  It's several books in length, and goes into details about the law, and examples of decisions based on the law.  It's sometimes referred to the law and the commentary.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	The Torah is the first five books of the OT that you know, called the Books of Moses. The rest of the OT is included in the Jewish Tanach, but they divide the books up differently. They don't divide large books into two parts, like 1 and 2 Kings, for instance. Also, the minor prophets are all contained in one book called simply "The Twelve". In this way, their Tanach is only made of 24 books, where our OT is made of 39, but they both have the same text in them. I don't know about the temple thing.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Ruth has given you an excellent answer. There are small but hugely significant changes between the Tanakh (Torah + Prophets + Writings) and the 'O.T.' Things like a change in verb tense from past to future, which makes it sound like a prophecy. Or different words altogether ('pierced' instead of 'like a lion', 'virgin' instead of 'young woman') that appear to indicate Jesus as Messiah. Christians insist that they're minor and therefore negligible changes, yet they hang their entire theology on them.<br>  <br>  There are preparations to rebuild the Temple, basically keeping materials and such at the ready in hopes of being able to use them. But there is no actual work being done, as a mosque sits on the site.<br>  <br>  Your friend may be 'well educated', but anyone's education is only as good as their sources. And there's a substantial industry in Christian books, someone could read for years and never run out of material. The problem is that Christianity has turned 1st century political propaganda coming out of Judea's desires for independence and Rome's abhorrence of that into 'Gospel truth'. Few Christians understand what Judaism *really* says, yet they've been taught from birth or baptism that they know our religion as well as their own.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Your friend sounds highly confused. <br>  <br>  Judaism follows the Tanach: A compilation of the Torah (first Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Kethuvi'im (Writings). We also follow the Talmud or Oral Law.<br>  <br>  The OT is different in translation, interpretation and wording in some cases.  It is also a precursor to a "New Testament" which we do not believe in or follow. <br>  <br>  Jews are not building the third temple: That is the messiah's job and will not happen until there is absolute peace in this world.<br>  <br>  Torah (The Law):<br>  * Genesis<br>  * Exodus<br>  * Leviticus<br>  * Numbers<br>  * Deuteronomy <br>  <br>  Nevi'im (The Prophets):<br>  * Joshua<br>  * Judges<br>  * I &II Samuel<br>  * I & II Kings<br>  * Isaiah<br>  * Jeremiah<br>  * Ezekiel<br>  * The Twelve: Hoshea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nachum, Habbakkuk, Zephaniah, Chaggai, Zechariah, Malakhi, <br>  <br>  Kethuvim (The Writings):<br>  * Psalms<br>  * Proverbs<br>  * Job<br>  * Song of Songs<br>  * Ruth<br>  * Lamentations<br>  * Ecclesiastes<br>  * Esther<br>  * Daniel<br>  * Ezra & Nechemyah (treated as one book)<br>  * Chronicles<br>  <br>  Mishnah:<br>  <br>  * Zera'im (Seeds): Agricultural laws<br>  Berakhot<br>  Peah<br>  Demai<br>  Kilayim<br>  Shebiit<br>  Terumot<br>  Maaserot<br>  Maaser Sheni<br>  Challah<br>  Orlah<br>  Bikkurim <br>   <br>  * Mo'ed (Festival): Dealing with Shabbat and festivals<br>  Shabbat<br>  Erubin<br>  Pesachim<br>  Sheqalim<br>  Yoma<br>  Sukkah<br>  Besah<br>  Rosh Hashanah<br>  Taanit<br>  Megillah<br>  Moed Qatan<br>  Hagigah <br>      <br>  * Nashim (Women): Dealing with marriage/divorce/contracts<br>  Yebamot<br>  Ketubot<br>  Nedarim<br>  Nazir<br>  Sotah<br>  Gittin<br>  Qiddushin <br>      <br>  * Nezikin (Damages): Dealing with tort laws/financial laws<br>  Baba Qamma<br>  Baba Mesia<br>  Baba Batra<br>  Sanhedrin<br>  Makkot<br>  Shabuot<br>  Eduyyot<br>  Avodah Zarah<br>  Avot (also known as Pirkei Avot, Ethics of the Fathers)<br>  Horayot <br>  <br>  * Kodashim (Holy Things): Dealing with the Temple<br>  Zevachim<br>  Menachot<br>  Chullin<br>  Bekhorot<br>  Arakhin<br>  Temurah<br>  Keritot<br>  Meilah<br>  Tamid<br>  Middot<br>  Qinnim <br>      <br>  * Toharot (Purities): Dealing with ritual purity and impurity<br>  Kelim<br>  Ohalot<br>  Negaim<br>  Parah<br>  Tohorot<br>  Miqvaot<br>  Niddah<br>  Makhshirin<br>  Zabim<br>  Tebul-Yom<br>  Yadayim<br>  Uqsin <br>  <br>  Here are some translation differences:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Psalm 22:17: "Hikifuni ca'ari yaday veraglay"<br>  Means: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"<br>  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the Tanach do the words ca'ari or hikifuny mean anything resembling the word pierce.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14: "Hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"<br>  Means: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."<br>  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."<br>  <br>  In Hebrew, 'ha' means 'the' and 'almah' refers to young woman. Betulah is Hebrew for virgin and is used in the Torah.<br>  <br>  The term mashiach literally means anointed one and refers to the practice of anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The word does not mean savior. Every King/High Priest was anointed with oil each being referred to as a messiah.|`|AA11485682	The Torah is one of the holy books of Judaism. There's nothing saying that a religion can only have one holy text. The others are the Talmud and the Midrash.<br>  <br>  The Torah shares some of the same texts as you'd find in Old Testament  but it's not exactly 100% the same. Your friend probably was told otherwise to make things simpler for them when they converted.<br>  <br>  And well, there is a temple in Israel. Several. So I'm not sure what your friend is specifically referring to. (Well, I think I know but I'm not going to try and guess.)

Go figure that one out.|`|Wt398Yueaa	I was all set to type a sarcastic comment when saw the statement by a Mormon that they only baptise dead people with their relatives permission. I still think the practise is ridiculous, but this is a step towards sanity. Not so long ago many people were getting very upset that their loved ones were being baptised as Mormons. I think that was a bit silly as well, but if the Mormons are becoming more sensitive of others, then the universe becomes happier.|`|3bBv23BNaa	I personally think it is a deplorable practice.

hzMpdFFBaa	Crowley was somewhat influenced by raja yoga and other eastern concepts. In my opinion, this adage (which Crowley borrowed from some French philosopher) means that a person needs to realize and act from his "true self"--which is the person who is there when all conditioning and artificial concepts and restrictions have been stripped away. Then one is a true self and acts accordingly, spontaneously and appropriately to the situation and without excuses, apologies, or regrets (ie, according to True Will).|`|e4tvh1d2aa	no, the whole of the law is not what you will.<br>  what is the law?<br>  it is a decided morality of the people of a society.<br>  humans being animals naturaly tend toward selfishness.<br>  if do whatever you want is the law.<br>  our society will end up entirly hermetical and would not be able to function.|`|P5rczL0Saa	It's the opposite of "God's Will Be Done."  It's in the satanic bible. <br>  The opposite of God's will is satan's will, and that is "do what thou wilt."    because satan doesn't want us doing God's will, so if he makes it pleasurable for ourselves and about ourselves, then it is enticing and it draws in those who are self indulgent and lovers of themselves instead of lovers of God. However, if anyone lives by this "law" of satan's they will pay the price in the end along with satan. And I keep mentioning satan because Alistair Crowley said that he was possessed by satan himself. He was called the most evil man on the face of the earth. Sounds like you like his book.  Turn to Jesus, and live!<br>  <br>  It means just what it says, "Do whatever YOU wan't"  So, if YOU WANT to kill someone, then do it; or if YOU WANT to steal, do it; or if YOU WANT to commit adultery, then do it; There's no law except DO WHAT YOU WANT. It's really not that deep, people. It's satans words.|`|seHL9nveaa	well translated isnt that like, do what you will do be the full of the law?<br>  so i think it sounds cool but it doesnt really make sence, sorry.<br>  but if ur tellin it 2 people who dont understand thees and thous its ok.|`|A4cBCHKmaa	That is what God meant by "free will". You might burn for it, but it is within your right. The problem is, when people do what they want, it usually involves hurting someone else.

Perhaps not. I suppose it would depend on who you really are, and not who you THINK you are, to determine the truth of Crowley's statement.

A reality created out of two imaginary points joined by an infinite number of other imaginary points which creted a line.  Out of imaginary points that, of course, didn't exist there became the 1st dimension.<br>  <br>  Then, in much the same way two other imaginary points became joined by an infinite number of imaginary points and became a line of the 1st dimension which crossed the other 1st dimension creating the 2nd dimension.  But like the 1st dimension with an infinitely short line there became an infinitely flat 2nd dimension.<br>  <br>  The imaginary points of these imaginary lines crossed at an imaginary point tri-secting all three imaginary points cresting the 3rd dimention.<br>  <br>  Given that there is no real difference between the infinitly small and the infanitely large within an imaginary situation the reality would be be an imaginary singularity.<br>  <br>  Then, in the vacancy of imagination the nonexistant points began to move and we now have the fourth dimension which allowed for motion or deterioration of the nonexistance of everything.<br>  <br>  So== are we the non-existant imagination of God or retroactively are we the creators of gods that do not exist?|`|MzKTLRgpaa	So... if i don't feel like sharing my thoughts... does that mean no pears for me?<br>  <br>  Well, in that case... hierarchy or not...pass me a slice of that pizza! ;-P<br>  Oh, and I'm baking chocolate chip cookies... =D<br>  <br>  A cookie for everyone!

"the fool has said in his haert that there is no God." Don't leave till you meet Him and have to bow before Him knowing it is too late to be saved. For the answer that calls christians "brainwashed kids" you should think again. I was 27 when I searched out the truth and accepted Jesus.  I was not even told about it before that. That is 40 yrs ago and I'm more sure than ever. I know of others who chose Christ as adults' One Christian told me his fathers occupation was a criminal. He lived by robbing, This son accepted Jesus and spent his life helping others. The story of Richard Green is too long to put here but he came out of a family of alcoholics and later saw them all saved ang changed. There are no second generation Christians. No one is christian because parents are. Many christian's chirdren go the wrong way. We trust God to bring them back hopefully. All Christians in the world today are there by choice. No other religion has this record. Don't get nominal Christians mixed with real saved ones.  I honestly with all am heart am convinced and beleive.   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to<br>  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be<br>  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the<br>  Bible and owning Him before others.

Ancient man believed that his breath was also his soul or "essence of life." When God made man, he "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." A rapid departure of that breath--a sneeze--is the same as expelling life from one's body. Also, it leaves a vacuum in the head which evil spirits can enter. Roman citizens feared sneezing when a plague hit their city during the reign of Pope Gregory the Great. Since they regarded the sneeze as a sure sign of approaching sickness, Pope Gregory in situated the use of the phrase "God bless you" to shield sneezers from any ill effects. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trivia-library.com/a/origin-of-common-superstitions-sneezing-and-bless-you.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.trivia-library.com/a/origin-o...</a>|`|CgwEfwOZaa	i think it means that someone is thinking about you|`|AA11043457	I always understood that when one sneezed that they thought they might lose their soul.

Nobody knows what happens, but your soul has to go somewhere.|`|7NTaAKLQaa	Well, if they believe Jesus died on the cross for their sins, they will go to heaven. No, there's no such thing as reincarnation. Need proof? If there was, and people were just dying and coming back, the world's population would be staying the same. But it's growing more everyday. Therefore, no. But you can be "reborn" in Christ. Those who don't believe in Christ die two deaths. The death of their body on earth. and the death of their soul in hell. But those who simply ask Jesus to forgive him and believe in Him will be born twice. Once on earth and then again in heaven.|`|7bgg4jgJaa	nobody knows for sure it's all a matter of faith.

But you are still kind and loving LOL|`|Mnm35sjNaa	The operative word here is "force".  You can easily force the robots to worship you: just include that requirement in their programming.<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist, so I don't have a problem with free will: it's a function of human intelligence.  God had nothing to do with it because there is NO God.  Everybody should keep in mind that NOBODY knows anything whatsoever about the supernatural -- and God is as supernatural as you can get.<br>  <br>  But IF there were a God and he forces us to worship him, then how come there's so many atheists?  Obviously, God doesn't force worship upon us.  So, if there is a God, then he must leave worship up to our free will.<br>  <br>  Let's assume there's a God who wants us to worship him.  What would he do to make this happen?<br>  <br>  There MUST be free will or else worship isn't possible.  So God should give us a reason to worship him, right?  I mean, if we have free will, then what's to stop us from choosing atheism?  In the absence of a reason to worship God, we can't be blamed for NOT worshiping God.  That's what free will is all about!<br>  <br>  Well, that's the problem . . . without any evidence of God, the only reason we're given to worship God is "holy" scripture (whether it be the divinely inspired Torah, Bible or Qur'an).<br>  <br>  But divinely inspired, holy, scripture is full of holes!  They're books of contradictions, ignorance and lies.  Their God is petty, jealous, vindictive and genocidal.<br>  <br>  In other words, without evidence all we have is scripture.  But scripture is reprehensible and unworthy of emulation, much less worship!<br>  <br>  So what's the reason God gives us (as free agents) to worship him?<br>  <br>  There is none.|`|NWopkX4baa	Robots may claim spiritual experiences.

It does seem that way sometimes, reading certain scriptures.<br>  <br>  But as we read and ponder all the scriptures, and especially as we live by their advisements, we begin to both comprehend and experience, by our own behaviour, a God who is wholly antithetical to pride and narcissim, who does all things thanklessly for his children's benefit, always ready to forgive their endless blasphemies if they ever ask forgiveness, and ready to show mercy to those pressured by culture to hate him.<br>  <br>  And this is the God who tells us to worship him -- not by constantly offering empty platitudes, helping nobody, but by learning of him and emulating him, which exalts and happifies not only God and not only us, but those around us too.  We serve God best by serving each other.<br>  <br>  Why does God care about his children helping each other?  Well, look at how ugly the alternative is.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	God does care because he loved us so much that he sent his only son jesus to die on the cross for all of our sins

In more technical terms it is a method or a theory "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive" (Bourke 263). Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position "that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge" to the radical position that reason is "the unique path to knowledge" (Audi 771). Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, "rationalism" is identical to philosophy, the Socratic life of inquiry, or the zetetic interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, Leo Strauss sought to revive Classical Political Rationalism as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as maieutic.|`|G49lKR56aa	An rationalist would and does have the ability to look at all evidence and come up with the best sound conclusion.<br>  I have talk to a few atheist and it is "there is no gods, period".

WyICbuPqaa	The Mormons are the only major Christian denomination that believes in latter-day prophets and modern revelation.  Their current standard restricting the use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea is based on modern day revelations given to latter-day prophets.  <br>  <br>  The first revelation concerning these substances is called the Word of Wisdom and can be found in Doctrine and Covenants, section 89.<br>  <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89</a>|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Leaving the many problems of the LDS to abstain from something harmful for the love of your God is no small sacrifice.  If you look at the Jews when they were called out they gave up many things.  Many Churches likewise require their followers to abstain from various things.  The Church of the Nazarene requires their members to abstain from drinking and used to avoid movies and dancing.  Though they would unlikely kick some one out for these things they may not be able to teach classes.|`|AA11297267	It has nothing to do with the bible.<br>  Joseph Smith claims to have received a revelation from god that mormons call the "word of wisdom" which tells them to not take strong drink (which they've interpreted as alcohol), hot drinks (which they've interpreted as coffee and tea), or tobacco.  It also tells them to eat meat sparingly and only in times of winter, which they mostly ignore.  That's the basis for mormons not drinking alcohol.<br>  <br>  Interestingly enough, when Joseph Smith was in jail just before the gunfight that led to his death, he sent out for a bottle of wine -- which he enjoyed with his fellow prisoners.  He was very much a "do as I say, not as I do" kinda guy :)<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|93r3nCM1aa	They don't drink because it goes against the word of wisdom. It's not a docterine of the church per say, but LDS people do not like the behaviors and health problems associated with drinking alcohol, so they abstain. (the whole "body is a temple" thing.)<br>  <br>  Your argument is weird though. It almost seems like you're infering that "If mormons want to be considered Christian, they need to drink like the other christians".<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist, and since I was raised in Utah, I abstain from alcohol. I don't know why...that's just what I do, and was part of the culture I grew up in. I just choose not to drink alcohol (even though my parents drink beer and wine). I don't care if others drink it, I just don't. <br>  <br>  So should I have to drink alcohol to be considered an atheist, since other atheists might drink?|`|kG9oI68eaa	whether or whether not someone drinks has nothing to do with their Christianity.

God will now be giving the rest of saved humanity their final reward - the New Heaven and the New Earth.<br>  Here are some of the things that will be happening:<br>  <br>  1.  Our earth, as we know it now, and our atmospheric heaven will pass away. In its place, we will be getting a new earth and a new atmospheric heaven. There will no longer be any seas. 2/3 of the earth is water. With all of the sea waters being taken out, we will have more land space in which to accommodate everyone.<br>  <br>  2.  There will no longer be any night. It will be daylight all the time. There will no longer be any sun or moon to shine their light. The Bible says that we will no longer have any need of the sun or the moon because the glory of God will now be illuminating the earth!<br>  <br>  3.  There will no longer be any more death in any way, shape or form. The curse of Adam and Eve will have finally been broken and done away with. In the Millennium Kingdom, as good as it is going to be, there is still going to be physical death for those humans who survive the Tribulation and enter into it physically. Though many of them will live long lives, they are still going to have to physically die.<br>  <br>  In addition to any kind of death being taken out, there will also be no more pain since we will all have new spiritual glorified bodies. The Bible says that all sorrow, pain, crying and death will be taken away. Every tear will be wiped away. There will be no more sickness or disease! Our new spiritual glorified bodies will no longer age, corrupt, die or be subject to any kind of illness or disease.<br>  <br>  4.  All things will be made brand new. I don't think our imaginations can even begin to conjure up or imagine what this verse is trying to tell us.<br>  <br>  5.  God the Father Himself will now be coming down to our earth to live and dwell with all of us forever and ever. The Bible says that we will no longer need the temple that will be in Jerusalem in the Millennium Kingdom. The Bible says that both God the Father and Jesus Christ will now be the Temple Themselves! The Bible says that the tabernacle of God will now be with men, that we will dwell with Him, that we will be His people, and that He will be our God forever and ever.<br>  <br>  6.  In the Millennium Kingdom, Jesus will be ruling this earth from the city of Jerusalem. It will be God's capital. However, in the New Heaven and New Earth, we will be getting a New Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that this new city will be like a square. It's length will be as great as its width. Bible Scholars feel that this city may literally be 1500 miles wide. It will be huge! This new city of Jerusalem will literally be descending down from Heaven itself. This brand new city will be coming directly from God.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that its walls are constructed of jasper and the city will be pure gold like clear glass. It says that the foundations of the walls will be adorned with all kinds of precious stones - the first foundation being jasper, the second foundation being sapphire, the third foundation being chalcedony and the fourth foundation being emerald, etc. The Bible goes on to state that there are 12 of these foundations and that each foundation is made with a different beautiful element. This is all described in Revelation 21:19-20.<br>  <br>  There will be 12 gates with each of the gates being made of solid pearl. The streets of this city will be pure gold. Each of the 12 gates will have an angel on it. There will 3 gates each to the north, south, east and west.<br>  <br>  Since all of the bad and unsaved people will have already been taken out, there will be nothing left that will be able enter into this holy city that will defile it or cause any type of abomination to occur in it. As a result, the gates to this city will always be open for all to enter in at anytime.<br>  <br>  Now here are the Scripture verses specifically telling us all of this.<br>  <br>  The Scripture Verses<br>  1.  This first verse will tell us that our earth and our heaven as we know it now will pass away, and in its place we will be getting a New Heaven and a New Earth. This verse also tells us that there will be no more sea in this new earth.<br>  <br>  "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had PASSED AWAY. Also there was no more sea." (Revelation 21:1) <br>  2.  This next verse tells us that the tabernacle of God will be coming down from heaven onto this new earth and that God Himself will literally be dwelling with all of us. It says that He will be our God and that we will be His people.<br>  <br>  This verse is also telling us that God will be wiping away every tear and that there will be no more death, sorrow, crying or pain. It then ends saying that all of the old and former things will now pass away, which will now make everything completely brand new!<br>  <br>  And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Beh

Once again I felt that incredible sense of peace & calm.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that you have to believe...just ponder it in your heart or as I said, store it for sometime later.  As for your friends, they mean well, so just accept them as they are.  Respect their beliefs & ask that they do the same for you.  And for heaven's sake do not be ashamed of your lack of belief.  You believe what you believe   You have nothing to be ashamed of.
iHDYncuXaa	Genesis 7:<br>  17 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. 18 The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 19 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. 20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet. [b] , [c] 21 Every living thing that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth.

Not really. Indeed, to some extent the earth is still flooded. Seventy percent of it is covered by water and only 30?percent is dry land. Moreover, 75?percent of the earth’s fresh water is locked up in glaciers and polar ice caps. If all this ice were to melt, the sea level would rise much higher. Cities like New York and Tokyo would disappear. Further, The New Encyclop?dia Britannica says: “The average depth of all the seas has been estimated at 3,790 metres (12,430?feet), a figure considerably larger than that of the average elevation of the land above the sea level, which is 840 metres (2,760?feet). If the average depth is multiplied by its respective surface area, the volume of the World Ocean is 11 times the volume of the land above sea level.”14 So, if everything were leveled out—if the mountains were flattened and the deep sea basins filled in—the sea would cover the whole earth to a depth of thousands of meters. For the Flood to have happened, the pre-Flood sea basins would have to have been shallower, and the mountains lower than they are now. Is this possible? Well, one textbook says: “Where the mountains of the world now tower to dizzy heights, oceans and plains once, millions of years ago, stretched out in flat monotony. .?.?. The movements of the continental plates cause the land both to rear up to heights where only the hardiest of animals and plants can survive and, at the other extreme, to plunge and lie in hidden splendor deep beneath the surface of the sea.”15 Since the mountains and sea basins rise and fall, it is apparent that at one time the mountains were not as high as they are now and the great sea basins were not as deep. What happened to the floodwaters after the Flood? They must have drained into the sea basins. How? Scientists believe that the continents rest on huge plates. Movement of these plates can cause changes in the level of the earth’s surface. In some places today, there are great underwater abysses more than six miles [more than 10?km] deep at the plate boundaries.16 It is quite likely that—perhaps triggered by the Flood itself—the plates moved, the sea bottom sank, and the great trenches opened, allowing the water to drain off the land.<br>  Traces of the Flood?--If we grant that a great flood could have happened, why have scientists found no trace of it? Perhaps they have, but they interpret the evidence some other way. For example, orthodox science teaches that the surface of the earth has been shaped in many places by powerful glaciers during a series of ice ages. But apparent evidence of glacial activity can sometimes be the result of water action. Very likely, then, some of the evidence for the Flood is being misread as evidence of an ice age. Similar mistakes have been made. Concerning the time when scientists were developing their theory of ice ages, we read: “They were finding ice ages at every stage of the geologic history, in keeping with the philosophy of uniformity. Careful reexamination of the evidence in recent years, however, has rejected many of these ice ages; formations once identified as glacial moraines have been reinterpreted as beds laid down by mudflows, submarine landslides and turbidity currents: avalanches of turbid water that carry silt, sand and gravel out over the deep-ocean floor.” Another evidence for the Flood appears to exist in the fossil record. At one time, according to this record, great saber-toothed tigers stalked their prey in Europe, horses larger than any now living roamed North America, and mammoths foraged in Siberia. Then, all around the world, species of mammals became extinct. At the same time, there was a sudden change of climate. Tens of thousands of mammoths were killed and quick-frozen in Siberia. Alfred Wallace, the well-known contemporary of Charles Darwin, considered that such a widespread destruction must have been caused by some exceptional worldwide event. Many have argued that this event was the Flood. An editorial in the magazine Biblical Archaeologist observed: “It is important to remember that the story of a great flood is one of the most widespread traditions in human culture .?.?. Nevertheless behind the oldest traditions found in Near Eastern sources, there may well be an actual flood of gigantic proportions dating from one of the pluvial periods .?.?. many thousands of years ago.”20 The pluvial periods were times when the surface of the earth was much wetter than now. Freshwater lakes around the world were much larger. It is theorized that the wetness was caused by heavy rains associated with the end of the ice ages. But some have suggested that on one occasion the extreme wetness of the earth’s surface was a result of the Flood.|`|gAl41HtGaa	The flood<br>  Ge:7:17: And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.<br>  Ge:7:18: And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.<br>  Ge:7:19: And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.<br>  Ge:7:20: Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.<br>  Ge:7:21: And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:<br>  Ge:7:22: All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.<br>  Ge:7:23: And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.<br>  Ge:7:24: And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any trouble finding anything in the bible or if you have questions about the bible please email me at straightisthepath@yahoo.com or look me up on myspace  search for me with the same email address straightisthepath@yahoo.com I hope I can help thanks and God bless|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Yes it really ended and everyone died except Noah and his family.

Then everyone is judged, the blessed are given new bodies, while the cursed go with Satan into the Lake of Fire. That is the Second Death.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Immediately upon death. What did Jesus say to the thief on the cross? <br>  <br>  Luke 23:43<br>  Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."|`|EM0kiImHaa	We go to heaven or hell immediately. There is no waiting room for dead people. <br>  <br>  This is also known as soul sleep.<br>  <br>  Soul sleep is a minority belief that the soul sleeps unconsciously between the death of the body and its resurrection on Judgment Day. The concept of “soul sleep” is not a biblical doctrine. When the Bible says a person is “sleeping” in relation to death (Luke 8:52; 1 Corinthians 15:6), it does not mean literal sleep. Sleeping is just a way to describe death because a dead body appears to be sleeping. The Bible tells us that the instant we die, we are taken to heaven or hell based on whether we have placed our faith in Christ for salvation. For believers, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23). For unbelievers, death means everlasting punishment in hell (Luke 16:22-23). The moment we die, we face the judgment of God (Hebrews 9:27). Until the resurrection, though, there is currently a temporary heaven, “Paradise” (Luke 23:43; 2 Corinthians 12:4), and hell, “Hades” (Revelation 1:18; 20:13-14).<br>  <br>  In a sense, a person’s body is “sleeping” while his soul is in the temporary Paradise or Hades. This body is then “awakened” and transformed into the eternal body a person will possess for eternity, whether in heaven or hell. Those who were in Paradise will be sent to the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1). Those who were in Hades will be thrown into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). These are the final, eternal destinations of all people—based entirely on whether or not they have trusted Jesus Christ alone for salvation from their sins.|`|HZqi9XyJaa	Death is referred to as sleep throughout the entire Bible.<br>  <br>  One passage which proves this beyond a doubt is Acts 2:29-36. Here we read "For David IS NOT ascended into the heavens". The dead know nothing. There are only a few people (other than Jesus) that went to heaven, Moses and Elijah for example.<br>  <br>  Man does not have a soul that is a seperate entity, man IS a living soul. What is returned to God when we die is the rememberance of us, it's who we are, the lifesource that was given to us. <br>  <br>  Jesus said when He returns His rewards are with Him AT THE SECOND COMING. Eternal life is a reward that we will receive. The belief that we die, go to heaven, then get yanked out of heaven to return to the grave so when Christ comes to bring us back to heaven just doesn't make sense. When Christ comes back is when He takes his followers home, those who have fallen asleep, then those who are still alive will be caught up together to meet them in the air and from then on will be with the Lord for eternity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF2xsTjgQ80&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF2xsTjgQ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.truthaboutdeath.com/immortal_soul.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthaboutdeath.com/immortal_...</a>|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	The resurrection occurs once the world is rid of wickedness.  Then the dead are resurrected to judgment or life.  Jesus gave the comforting assurance to mankind: “The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live.?.?.?. Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.”—Joh 5:25-29.<br>  <br>  But when someone dies, they are asleep, conscious of nothing as the following scriptures indicate:  “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages.” Since the dead “are conscious of nothing at all,” they cannot hear, see, speak, feel, or think. They no longer earn any wages. How could they? They are incapable of any work! Moreover, “their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished,” for they cannot express any emotion.—Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,?10.<br>  <br>  So when we die, our consciousness returns to exactly the same state it was before we were alive. It is as God told Adam after he disobeyed: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) In that sense, humans are no different from animals. Regarding the condition of the dead, it is just as the Bible says: “There is no superiority of the man over the beast.”—Ecclesiastes 3:19,?20.<br>  <br>  The Bible is clear on this: When a person dies, he ceases to exist. Death is the opposite of life. The dead do not see or hear or think. Not even one part of us survives the death of the body. We do not possess an immortal soul or spirit.<br>  <br>  After Solomon observed that the living know that they will die, he wrote: “As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” He then enlarged on that basic truth by saying that the dead can neither love nor hate and that “there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in [the grave].” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,?10) Similarly, Psalm 146:4 says that when a man dies, “his thoughts do perish.” We are mortal and do not survive the death of our body. The life we enjoy is like the flame of a candle. When the flame is put out, it does not go anywhere. It is simply gone.<br>  <br>  Therefore the resurrection takes place at a different time that God has set to do so.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	Well there is biblical evidence that there is an immediate judgment, the parable of Lazarus and the rich man explains that Lazarus and the rich man were both immediately judged and sent to separate place however in Rev. 20:12 it talks about a final judgment when all the dead are brought before God and judged. I am of the opinion that there is an immediate place of punishment and paradise, but at the end the final judgment will come and then will we find our permanent place in the afterlife, for I believe that there is a chance to repent for those that never knew about Jesus or God and that is why the Corinthians were baptizing for the dead. 1 Cor. 15:29|`|waz8ONEEaa	different versions of christianity will tell you different things.<br>  <br>  what particular denomination are you?|`|QoTfQfRFaa	It is BOTH ways. as in the next verse some people will go to heaven and they will come back to earth as "angels" to labor more.<br>  Remember Moses and Elijah came and talked with Jesus while peter, james and John were there with him.<br>  <br>  2Co 5:9  Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.<br>  <br>       Some people will rest in their grave until the trumpet sounds<br>  <br>  Joh 5:28  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<br>  <br>       BUT you can rest assured all will be doing this in the next verse.<br>  <br>  2Co 5:10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<br>  <br>       hope this helps. Oh be nice to your Mom. Remember..Honor your father and mother.<br>  <br>  Col 3:20  Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord<br>  <br>  <br>  HADASSAH: it is true David did not ASSEND meaning he did not carry himself up to heaven. ONLY Jesus went up on his own power all others will be "caught up" by the power of God. His coffin was there and his bones were in it but does that mean "David" was in the coffin?<br>  <br>  FIRECHILD: since the dead know nothing then how did Moses and Elijah talk with Jesus about how he was going to die, while on the on the mountain top while the 3 apostles were there. I might be wrong but I don't think God talks to nothing, and the apostles ask to build a tent to nothing. AND how did they know who they were if they were nothing and why would Jesus tell them to tell no man about this "nothing" untill after his death?<br>  Mat 17:3<br>  Mar 9:4<br>  Luk 9:30

Her femoral head was small and her femoral neck was short, both primitive characteristics. Her greater trochanter, however, was clearly derived, being short and human like rather than taller than the femoral head. The length ratio of her humerus to femur was 84.6% compared to 71.8% for modern humans and 97.8% for common chimpanzees, indicating that either the arms of A. afarensis were beginning to shorten, the legs were beginning to lengthen, or that both were occurring simultaneously. Lucy also possessed a lumbar curve, another indicator of habitual bipedalism.<br>  <br>  Johanson was able to recover Lucy's left innominate bone and sacrum. Though the sacrum was remarkably well preserved, the innominate was distorted like a carnivorous child or infant, leading to two different reconstructions. The first reconstruction had little iliac flare and virtually no anterior wrap, creating an ilium that greatly resembled that of an ape. However, this reconstruction proved to be faulty, as the superior pubic rami would not have been able to connect if the right ilium was identical to the left. A later reconstruction by Tim White showed a broad iliac flare and a definite anterior wrap, indicating that Lucy had an unusually broad inner acetabular distance and unusually long superior pubic rami. Her pubic arch was over 90 degrees, similar to modern human females. Her acetabulum, however, was small and primitive.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	Here are some sites. Start reading and studying.

97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	I understand exactly what you mean.  <br>  I always try to be polite, honest and accurate.  But sometimes I run across a question which, to put it bluntly, is little more than a rant.  <br>  There is no direct commandment in the Bible to tell you to be firm with people who commit transgressions of one kind or another.  But we can infer from Christ's actions some things that He never said.<br>  When He saw the merchants in the temple, Christ too a stand against what they were doing.  He even chastised his own disciples for always asking about what was coming or about things that did not concern them.<br>  So when you come across people who are trying to get into my business, I simply ignore their questions or comments or at the very worst simply state that what they are referring to has nothing to do with the subject matter and in the same breath ask them if their arguments are so weak that they feel the need to change the subject or use misdirection .  That usually gets the message across.<br>  On the other hand, if you open a discussion or are making an argument, and the issue that they bring up does have relevance, then I do not dismiss it, because doing so would weaken the position.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|vQe5WTkraa	He is whatever you want him to be.

We have laws for a reason and NO ONE should be exempt, including people who are "Of God."

Babies who die before they get the chance to grow up who had true CHRISTIAN parents, will be saved under their Paren'ts salvation.

Mnm35sjNaa	You should challenge your idea of sin.<br>  <br>  Have you ever done something you regret? Well, if so, how does that compare to eating a fruit from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil”? If all sins are the same to God and all sin is disobedience to God, then eating the apple was, by God’s own terms, a pedestrian sin.<br>  <br>  Yet God condemned all of us to death because of a single sin by a pair of humans with no life experience. Are you guilty of Eve’s sin? Of course not! No more so than for Hillary Clinton’s sins or for mine. Right off the bat, common sense tells us that the Bible, in Genesis, is preaching a twisted morality. It puts us in opposition to ourselves by claiming our nature is sinful. Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt. I reject that neurosis: I believe most of us are basically good but we sometimes make mistakes. If we live life believing we’re no good, then we probably won’t be.<br>  <br>  But that’s definitely not what the Bible preaches, is it? We’re ALL unworthy sinners.<br>  <br>  The Bible says God created the universe, including Adam and Eve. They were pure and sinless and had all eternity, in Eden, to bask in God’s glory.<br>  <br>  Unless they pissed Him off, of course.<br>  <br>  And it doesn’t take much to piss off God. No sir! And second chances? Forget about it. One mistake and you’re history. By the way, all of your offspring, forever, will also be cursed with death. How do you like them apples?<br>  <br>  To recap:<br>  <br>  Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)    Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)    God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)    God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.  Any religion that demands we deny our nature is NOT healthy.  Period.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	1)  No.  Heaven and hell are determined only by whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not.  For this is the forgiveness of sins. <br>  <br>  2)  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)<br>  <br>  3)  All saved believers are still sinners.  <br>  <br>  4)  There are no "seven deadly sins" in the Bible.  <br>  <br>  5)  All sins past, present, and future, are forgiven when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation.
GEfUTyi8aa	yes, because these religions are abusive to the human mind.... most serial killers were abused... neglected and in some cases tortured and told it was gods will...... I know sad...... I feel tortured right now....I should leave R&S|`|NWnOTkwCaa	So, apart from the fact that "devout" is a pretty fuzzy and inaccurate adjective for these people, what's your point, precisely? <br>  The real truth is that the most brutal, violent, and prolific serial killers in America are the several thousand gruesome men who kill unborn babies for a living, and not one of those monsters is a Christian.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	And... they are white males for sure, white doughboy males.<br>  <br>  Just stop and think for a moment, would a "true Christian", one who imitates Christ (Christian) be a serial killer?<br>  <br>  True Christians do not kill other humans and do not behave in a way contradictory to how Christ and his Father, Jehovah God, would have us behave.<br>  <br>  The ones you speak of are "false Christians", those who talk the talk but meanwhile do not walk the walk.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Maybe they should do a similar profile in communist China where the number of atheists is significantly higher. (No offense intended to anyone). Just stats seem to be able to manipulated when suitable. Ethan I got a chuckle at some of the points on your link. Higher than average I.Q.  Are you sure you want to correlate this with us Christians. Besides I don't wet my bed I wear depends. I also get a chuckle at the asker's comment "many of these quote the bible as a basis for their murder".  Like what? Jesus said "turn the other cheek" and like it or not I'm here to turn some cheeks. Or let him that is without sin cast the first stone.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	I guess that also correlates to the fact that more than 60 percent of serial killers were still wetting their beds over the age of twelve.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I read a book that shows that they were also mostly Geminis.

Yes, because the vast majority of the population as a whole are addicted to chocolate.  <br>  <br>  But the fact that they were/are specifically from very conservative sects is more revealing.  It may have to do with the "have the name, you may as well have the game" philosophy that happens when some people decide that they are going to hell anyway, so it doesn't matter what they do.  <br>  <br>  That's one of the many, many problems with Christianity in general and the most extreme sects in particular.  The other goes the opposite direction:  if they do what they do in the name of God, it's right and not wrong.  Jack the Ripper may have been one such; he killed prostitutes.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	Well they can't have been too devout if they ignored the basic core teachings of Christianity.<br>  <br>  And what does that statistic prove anyway?<br>  <br>  If you profile serial killers in an Muslim country what religion are they likely to be?<br>  <br>  If you profile serial killers in a Hindu country what religion are they likely to be?<br>  <br>  If you profile serial killers in an buddhist country what religion are they likely to be?<br>  <br>  If you profile serial killers in an Atheistic Communist regime would you be shocked if they turned out to be Atheists?<br>  <br>  you cannot judge a religion by its practitioners for they may not be practising it properly. <br>  <br>  You have to look to the original founder; and the original scriptures; to see if they are doing what their religion teaches or whether they are acting of their own accord.<br>  <br>  Then and only then can you judge if the religion is at fault or if the people are the problem.<br>  <br>  As Jesus and the Apostles never murdered anyone and never commanded the killing of anyone, I would suspect that in the case you mentioned it was the people who were the problem and like I said they can't have been as devout, fundamentalist or 'hard-shell'  as you think if they did the opposite of what the founders of Christianity taught and did. On the contrary, they sound like very bad Christians who couldn't have got it more wrong!|`|LYnuEdKUaa	It kind of sounds like the fundamentalist or "hardcore" aspect of their faith was the influence, not the religion itself.

Rn4GXoJAaa	Lots of things.<br>  <br>  1. Catholics believe that salvation is by baptism, confession, receiving the eucharist, etc. Christians believe that salvation is through faith in Christ (ie asking him to forgive you), separate from the need for "good works" or ceremonies.<br>  <br>  2. Catholics pray to Mary, saints, angels, etc. Christians pray only to God.<br>  <br>  3. Catholic mass is highly litergical, with a focus on the visual (statues, etc.), Christian church is focuses on hearing the word of God (ie "sermon")<br>  <br>  I could give you much, much more if you are really wanting to research it.

There are Protestant Christians, Catholic Christians, and Orthodox Christians. Catholics and Protestants agree on the divine inspiration of Scripture, the trinity, the virgin birth, the historical accuracy of Scripture, salvation by faith, the Virgin Birth, and lots of other doctrines. Protestants believe in the authority of the Bible alone; Catholics don't. Protestants believe in salvation by faith alone; Catholics don't. Catholics believe the Pope is infallible; Protestants don't. Catholics pray to Mary and the "saints"; Protestants don't. Catholics believe baptism is necessary for salvation and that Christ is "literally" present in the communion wafer; Protestants believe baptism and communion are symbolic.<br>  There's more, but that's the main stuff.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Catholic is one of the many denominations of the christian religion.  The difference is mostly on dogma and doctrine, and also on liturgical practices.  One major difference between catholics and other christian denomination is the basis for salvation.  Most christians believe that faith alone in Christ is enough to be saved.  Catholics believe that faith is just the starting point of salvation, that transformation into the image of Christ, thereby becoming another christ in the way he deals with others is necessary for salvation.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Last I heard, Catholics were Christians.|`|7cLYgf2raa	Christians are born-again by the incorruptible seed, the word of God.

They have many truths of the faith but they have piled up doctrines not taught by Christ or the apostles.  Catholics make many claims that directly contradict the bible.  This is why latin was read in catholic churches until just a few decades ago.  The catholic church did not want regular "lay" people to have access to the bible because they didnt want them to question the authorty of the church.  There is nothing infallible about the "church"  see the inquisition, crusades, dark ages, etc... The faith has been corrupted by ritualism.  Protestantism is not free form error either.|`|UIgDmhnIaa	Well, here are some things:<br>  <br>  Catholics have confession(like the confessions booth, Christians believe in confession but like, we dont have the booths) priests, they pray to the virgin Mary, they have books that they added to the bible, they call their priests "father". They believe they can pray people into heaven after death. <br>  <br>  Christians don't do any of this.|`|E0CZ69FYaa	It is important to remember that at least some Catholics are Christians. The difference between Protestant and Catholic churches vary. Catholics believe in something called transubstantiation. Some Catholic's believe that you must be baptized to be saved. Protestant churches say it is through faith that you are saved. <br>  In Ephesians it says "4But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. 6And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9not by works, so that no one can boast."<br>  The main thing is that some Catholics believe salvation is works based and Protestents believe you attain salvation through faith.|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	The definition of Christian is:<br>  <br>  adj.<br>  1. Professing belief in Jesus as Christ or following the religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus.<br>  2. Relating to or derived from Jesus or Jesus's teachings.<br>  3. Manifesting the qualities or spirit of Jesus; Christlike.<br>  4. Relating to or characteristic of Christianity or its adherents.<br>  5. Showing a loving concern for others; humane.<br>  n.<br>  1. One who professes belief in Jesus as Christ or follows the religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus.<br>  2. One who lives according to the teachings of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Therefore any religion who teaches about or professes faith in Jesus can be called Christian.  However the dispute lies between those who feel there are Christians and then there are TRUE Christians.  Which means THEY have the right faith and understanding of the Bible and teachings of Jesus.  Christianity is not a denomination, it is a specific category of belief system.  <br>  <br>  Many of the reasons that people will specify a difference between Catholic and Christian is because Catholics were the Holy Roman Empire which was a whole society, then once they fell from power, they still exist as one of the worlds largest and most pervasive religions.<br>  <br>  Also there was a Reformation that took place where many people broke off from the idealogy of the Catholic Church and gained new perspective and insight regarding what the Bible says.  This is where you get all the different branches of Christianity now (tho not all started that way).  <br>  <br>  Many people also feel that Catholics can't be called Christian because of what they perceive to be serious hypocrisy on their part.  <br>  <br>  But that is for everyone to make their own determination on.  Careful study and comparison can help you do so if you choose.|`|akwVAZcEaa	True Christianity is based entirely on Bible information, Commandment-keeping, prophecy and individual faith in a sovereign God.<br>  Catholicism is based on ancient pagan ritualism, privately modified Commandments, little or no prophecy and reliance on what an ordinary man (the Pope) dictates.<br>  <br>  There are many wonderful Catholics and Protestants, of course, but both are greatly misled by false teachings by corrupt institutions.|`|erRAnTBSaa	Catholics are Christian.  Christian's believe in Christ.  Catholics just believe a different set of principles than do the Protestants.

You confess to God through a priest,  they confess only to God.  You have Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests & Nuns, they have only Ministers & Deacons.

It's best to keep an open mind.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	Astronomy, cosmology and Earth sciences tell us how - it took billions of years for our lovely blue planet to evolve to its current state.  And evidence does indeed point to the universe starting with a bang some 13.5 billion years ago.<br>  <br>  If your god isn't powerful enough to wield the cosmological forces of the Big Bang, or clever enough to create something as elegant as evolution, or patient enough to work over billions of years, then maybe you should get a better god.<br>  <br>  I have nothing against Christianity. But when you think of the Bible as an exact history and science textbook, you diminish your god to a few 2000-year-old campfire stories told by shepherds.  And you close your mind to the true, factual wonders of our world and universe.<br>  <br>  If you work to understand the sciences that so many people here dismiss, you'll learn things that are truly divine and glorious.|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	I am not a scientist so I actually have no idea.

Well God always existed, no beginning and no end, he also lives outside of time.

But we do know there was a beginning and that leads to the problem.<br>  If all the mass in the universe was condensed into a pin sized ball or what ever size you pick, than it, without outside-supernatural intervention, would not have banged at all because objects at rest tend to stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. What force?

That sex duality continued to evolve through the duality of sexual opposites, because God needed the experience of opposites to evolve consciousness.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Your question includes an unstated assumption... that some hypothetical god put nipples on men.

It's an unfolding narrative, so it only tells stuff that's important to the story. (In The Wizard of Oz, we aren't told why Dorothy lives with her Aunt Em. She just does, so the reader accepts it. The reason why is not important to the story.) The Bible's not here to satisfy our idle curiosity, even if we're Christians. It's here to reveal God to us, and to tell us how to get saved, and to tell us what God's plan is for this creation.

He is for real. ( I am quorting form another answer I have given)<br>  it is a sense of belonging.<br>  You need to belong in all aspects of your existence.<br>  the thinking logical brain will trail analysis to the beginning of all things the beginning of creation.<br>  to the cause behind our existence<br>  to the question dumb and smart people asks why am here<br>  to the questions philosophers and scientist how come I am here.<br>  <br>  the answer would be a mere unintelligent, ignorant, weak, chance accidentally out of all odds caused this intelligent universe (that we know lots about, the atoms the electrons, the mass, the gas, the time, the place, the dimension, the direction, the order, the mechanics, the quantum, etc.) to pop up out of nothing.<br>  or<br>  there is an Intelligent knowledgeable, powerful cause/entity (beyond our thinking of how this came to be, since we can not comprehend what we do not see or measure) that caused all this to pop-up. <br>  <br>  It is up to you which choice to take, and hold yourself accountable to it.|`|h07uBpjNaa	My answer has two parts: Evidence and experience.<br>  <br>  From the point of view of the evidence, we can start with science. The Big Bang Theory, which is gaining more and more support from scientists around the world, and Einstein's equations say that the universe had a beginning at a fixed point in time. Since the universe is not infinite, something had to create it.<br>  <br>  Some say that the universe is expanding and then collapsing back on itself only to re-explode (many Big Bangs) again and again. The laws of thermodynamics show that this cannot be the case as matter tends toward chaos (more random) and a sequence of Big Bangs would eventually convert the energy required to sustain it into other forms and it would die out. So looking at it from this point of view, the universe is once again finite. Anything finite had to have a beginning. Anything with a beginning had to have a creator.<br>  <br>  When we start to examine the world, the way things work so closely together, the way we have minds and emotions and so on, we can conclude that this creator must be personal, must have been intentional, and must have had a plan. All of this points to the existence of a god of some kind.<br>  <br>  Then when we look through history, we have eye-witness accounts of times when this creator-god inserted himself into his creation. People in all cultures in all parts of the world know something of this god. There is a universal human longing to connect with this creator. Some hide it, some embrace it, but it's there nevertheless.<br>  <br>  On the experience side, I can tell you that my walk in the world changed dramatically the day I started believing in God. I was 24 at the time, and an avowed atheist. Jesus Christ got a hold of me and my life was radically changed. My life has purpose and meaning that it previously lacked as I sought my own pleasure. I have a tremendous hope for the future--life doesn't end at the grave. Following Jesus has also altered my view of the world such that I understand where I came from, why I'm here, what I can do to help the world, and where I'm going when it's all over.<br>  <br>  These are the reasons I believe in God. I hope this helps.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	You don't have to believe in God, everyone has their own beliefs and the list would go on too long. No one knows for sure if he exists, but they believe in him anyways. It has good moral teachings although it disrespects gay/lesbians/Bi people in some religions. when isn't he supposed to love all his children no matter what? I don't know, it's pretty confusing. <br>  <br>  Science has some pretty good information to back it up.<br>  <br>  I personally, believe in science.|`|FKR45WLPaa	I believe in God. I know that science can explain how living things were created.  They can explain defending your young for the sake of survival of species.  But nothing in science can explain the love that people have for one another, that's not science or evolution.  I don't believe in medical miracles, I don't believe in coincidences.  I DO believe that God performs miracles.  I believe that when I asked for God to take the cancer away from my uncle, that it wasn't a coincidence when my uncle began to heal.  I don't really know how to convince people to believe in God, I just know that He is there, everywhere, all of the time.  And I have found great comfort in that.  And why not believe?  What would it hurt?  God loves people either way.  Hope that helps.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	-All the good that comes in the world could not be from this world.<br>  -A month ago I had an ear infection but was crying over it because I just got over the flu the week before.  I begged Him to make it stop and I heard Him say in my heart that I was okay.  I believed Him and that same night, right then and there the aches and the soar throat and the deaf ear was gone.  I could hear again.  My personal miracle that I love.<br>  -All the miracles written about the lives of the saints.  Their stigmatas, apparitions, visions, voices, and experiences.  They are too real and similar to be made up or though up.<br>  -Every "coincidence" that happens is God speaking to me.<br>  -Every joy in my life I know comes through and by Him.<br>  -Every tear in my life hadn't passed through His eyes first before my own.<br>  -How can a love so strong be denied?  Think about WHO God is for you and what he has DONE for you....YES, for you personally.  Everything He has done in the Bible was for you because He would've died if it were only YOU in this world.  If you were the only one he created, he would've died the same death.

I wish I could give you some solid evidence but there is now so all I can give you is this--look at your eyes--how they can focus on your eye lashes or somethng so tiny like a flee and at the same time focus on on the farthest thing from you( is it possible that evolution did this? and yet we still see apes which some say is our closest relative so why did apes turned to men and this apes at the zoo still look like apes?) look around you and see the mighty creation our Creator has done for there is no other god that did this even if some believe in the greek gods and others.   <br>  J. seek a church where they preach the Bible--the whole gospel of God and you will slowly see God--spirtiually speaking of course and if you still feel lost think, what else is there in this world--look around you for there is so much hurt and pain around us but this is related to men's disbelief--they think for themselves--care for no one but themselves.

[Job 12:10]<br>  <br>  Eternal Life is Offered<br>  <br>  And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

[1 John 5:11-13]<br>  <br>  Rebirth is required<br>  <br>  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  [John 3:3 ]<br>  <br>  GOD’s GIFT OF LIFE<br>  <br>  Death is Inevitable<br>  <br>  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: [Romans 5:12]<br>  <br>  Eternal Life is a Gift<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Romans 6:23]<br>  <br>  Jesus Shared with us in Life and Death<br>  <br>  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. [Hebrews 2:9]<br>  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage [Hebrews 2:14-15]<br>  <br>  POWERFUL LIFE<br>  <br>  Jesus Rose From The Dead<br>  <br>  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  :5  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?  He is not here, but is risen: [Luke 24:1-6]<br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul wrote of Jesus Christ<br>  <br>  And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: [Romans 1:4]<br>  <br>  RESURRECTION LIFE<br>  <br>  Death is not the end.<br>  <br>  “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?”  [John 11:25 ,26 ]<br>  <br>  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?   Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  [John 14:3 ,6]<br>  <br>  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?    As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.    Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.   For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,   Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

If you look at the history of religion, you will soon see that it has developed from primitive nature gods, which explained the natural forces that primitive men did not understand and could not control.  From those gods of thunder, sun, wind, and other natural forces, the concept has matured - but each new version can be traced back to older versions.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, science has steadily found natural causes and explanations for all those phenomena once claimed to be the province of deities.  There's no good reason to expect that process to stop.  A lot of religious people will tell you that certain things are too complicated to be explained by science - creation of the universe, self-awareness, development of species, and so on.  But religious people used to believe that thunder and lightning were too powerful and complicated to explain by anything other than a thunder god.<br>  <br>  There's no reason to assume any god exists, and no evidence pointing to such existence.

It speaks of decievers, the anichrist, the corruption of the church, and how seven nations will lead to the end. Christ is supposed 2 return and rule Earth for 1000 years. This will be the final battle for souls for 1000 years until Satan is released from hell. At this point there will be 1 more battle and then God will destroy the universe. You will be condemmed 2 heaven or hell.<br>    Ask me any questions you need 2 ascertain on deciphering RTevalations, especially chapter 13 (the slaughtered lamb).

The Bible indicates that God's communication to Moses was centered on the relationship between God and man and the rules by which God wanted man to live. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the creation account mirrors the content of the rest of the Bible, which centers on mankind and his relationship to God. <br>  <br>  The question, "Why would God leave out a description of the dinosaurs?" is a bad one to begin with. A more appropriate question should be "What would God want to relate to man about His description of the creation?"<br>  <br>  Many who have studied the Bible believe that it does mention dinosaurs in the text. Specifically, Genesis 1:21 says that God created "great sea monsters" on the fifth day.1 The Hebrew word tanni?yn, can have several meanings, including "dragon," "serpent," "sea monster," or "venomous snake."2 An analysis of other Old Testament verses indicates that this word usually refers to contemporary aquatic animals or snakes:<br>  <br>  Verse3 Animal <br>  Genesis 1:21 Ancient (?) Aquatic Animal <br>  Exodus 7:9 Contemporary Snake <br>  Exodus 7:10 Contemporary Snake <br>  Exodus 7:12 Contemporary Snake <br>  Deuteronomy 32:33 Contemporary Snake <br>  Job 7:12 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  Psalms 74:13 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  Psalms 91:13 Contemporary Snake <br>  Psalms 148:7 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  Isaiah 27:1 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  Isaiah 51:9 Ancient Land Animal <br>  Jeremiah 51:34 Contemporary Land Animal <br>  Ezekiel 29:3 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  Ezekiel 32:2 Contemporary Aquatic Animal <br>  <br>  So, although tanni?yn could refer to a dinosaur in Genesis 1, in most other usage throughout the Old Testament, the word refers to species that existed at the time the Old Testament books were written.<br>  <br>  The second instance where the Bible might refer to dinosaurs occurs first in the book of Job. The Leviathan4 is described as being an armored aquatic creature in the book of Job, the Psalms, and Isaiah.5 The descriptions claim that the creature was contemporary with the writers of the Bible, and are not inconsistent with large alligators or crocadiles. Although dinosaurs are not specifically mentioned in the Bible, the fossil deposits they produced are described as being used by early humans in the opening chapters of Genesis.6|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	They didnt have to worry about that when that story was written, because the people who wrote it didnt know that dinosaurs ever existed.|`|AA10641825	Dinosaurs came so far before the Bible that God didn't even know they existed.|`|TxV2DRpNaa	all animals came before man.
HbCWNCQzaa	Jesus is your best friend|`|f0LpNwHdaa	I'm sorry about your lost but if you really cared about him, you would except him for who he was. <br>  God also said to never judge someone what they do or believe in, but by the measurement of there heart. God wouldn't want you to not be his friend because he's a homosexual, only if he was trying to make you do bad things. <br>  <br>  Not being friends with someone because there homosexual is just like being racist. <br>  <br>  A true friend wouldn't judge there friend just because there homosexual, or race, or religion. If you really loved him (as a friend) you would except him for who he is.<br>  <br>  Also isn't against your religion to be mean or cruel to people, because telling someone you dont want to be friends with them because there homosexual is VERY VERY mean. <br>  <br>  God said to love all.|`|SpTCiDQUaa	Dude, that's rude. And it's not a good testimony. If he confided in you that means he trusts you. And I don't think he was looking for the reaction you gave him. A holier than thou attitude IS a turn off. We are supposed to love unconditionally..whether the person be gay or straight, black or white. I believe you need to repent. Pray about it. Pray for him.|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	Just because your friend is gay is no reason to turn away from him. I have a gay nephew so what am I suppose to walk away from him? NO and I do not love him any less.<br>  JUST BECAUSE, you are a christian and so am I does NOT mean that you have to give up your friendship with your best friend. GOD IS LOVE and we as christians is suppose to be representing god in that fashoion....LOVE ALL.<br>  You may want to think it over before you lose your best friend. Best friends are very hard to come by.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Good luck finding a friends when you put an imaginary being over someone you can see, touch, and feel.  Honestly, I have little sympathy for homosexuals, us atheists are in that same category and it's not so bad.

I think you should open your eyes and not be so confined to what religion says 'must be'. <br>  <br>  However, I know you're probably upset because ending a friendship is never easy. My only suggestion is that, since you are a religious person, you should seek friendship within your place of worship, that way you can build relationships with people who have similar outlooks on life. Good luck in your search for a new friend and hopefully you can look past people's sexual preference and realize that they have souls that will go to heaven no matter what you may think.|`|oNJwCXxNaa	I feel sorry for you|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	I would not allow you to be friends with anyone I know. <br>  <br>  You might as well be saying, "you're black, I can't hang out with you"<br>  <br>  -Atheist<br>  <br>  (You make me sick to be a human)|`|l1ctIW7eaa	it's against your religion to be a homosexual...not to be friends with a homosexual|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	How sad, your friend probably needs even more of a shoulder and all you can do is think of yourself.<br>  <br>  I mean, you did turn around and basically tell the person you call a BEST friend that you yourself were not actually a best friend after all. Since your friendship was apparently conditional.<br>  <br>  You might not approve, but real friends don't turn their backs on each other over stuff like that. Especially in arrogant ways that cause one to say "he refused my offer" like you are superior.<br>  <br>  Friends aren't just picked up someplace, to fill a void in oneself, they are found.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Its good that he came out the closet for you, a closet gay is pretty scary. But the truth is we cannot really have gay friends, they will always try to pull us away from the truth. Maybe the friendship has to end, but you still climb on for victory in Christ. Dont be angry, but pray for him and then move on. Its hard but he will only try to lure you into a world that you really dont want to parake of.|`|nhGIZE71aa	You can't be serious.  If you really did that, I hope you never find a best friend.  For his sake.|`|usfVqbajaa	get out of the closet|`|GBKaftrJaa	Honestly, I think you did the best thing you could do.  I no longer believe in having male friends at all because too many times I've been friends with guys and they've hit on me, even married ones that I thought were safe to be friends with.  <br>  <br>  But I kept one male friend that I'd had since high school who was now gay. I figured, and told him, that the reason why I'd still be friends  with him is he was safe and I'd never have to worry about that with him.  We'd been friends, good friends that confided in each other and did fun things together, like movies, for about 22 years or so when he stopped taking my calls, and just dropped out of my life. He finally called me out of the blue saying that he'd decided to end all his old friendships because they were too much "work" for him.<br>  <br>  When he said that I knew his life choices had become so depraived he must be keeping a lot of secrets from me. He had already told me about going to sex parties and how depraved the places he was going to were. I never judged.  And for him to suggest our relationship meant work for him, told me there were much worse things he must now be doing that he is so ashamed of that he can't even come to one of his most open minded friends about.  I never outed him. I never did anything but accept him the way he was.<br>  <br>  And I'm telling you, he had been such a social outgoing person, I think his homosexual lifestyle just really changed him and not in a good way.  In my heart of hearts I hope he can change his ways and come back to his old friends and repent of his ways.  But, sadly, in that case if he decides to be straight, then I can't be friends with him because I'd have the male/female thing to worry about.<br>  <br>  And I never once said one word of reproach to him and accepted him as he was.  I sympathized with him because his uncle was a bishop and talked against homosexuality around him without knowing his nephew was gay and his uncle said things that would have been hurtful to him. So I was nothing but supportive and he still dumped me as a friend.<br>  <br>  So I can't be your shoulder to cry on (because of my no male/female friendships rule) but I did want to boost your spirits and tell you there's nothing you can do to maintain this friendship.  And I've lost many female friends too and it always hurts. I hope to find many new friends and hope you do too and soon for the both of us.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Methinks I smell a troll. <br>  <br>  But if you are serious, then you're better off without him as your friend. You obviously place your religion above loyalty and friendship, so you chose to end the relationship. How terribly stressful on poor little you, that you need a shoulder to cry on.<br>  <br>  And I *know* he's better off without a judgmental, self-righteous condemning twit whose sole purpose in the friendship apparently was to have someone they could use as a crying towel.<br>  <br>  But I still think you're a troll.|`|tIoZXHctaa	what are you serious....look if he really is your friend you shouldnt be mad at the guy for being gay anywayz how long yous were friends shouldnt you have been figured out by now...its not like the guy is asking you to be ******* gay with you....plus gay people make money how can you kick your rent buddy you should worry about paying rent and as for a shoulder to cry I cant help.....srry :(|`|FarsCSY1aa	Have sex with him.

I see that you have a reason for what you believe and I accept it as that. As far as pushing my religion on others I don't agree with that. I simply see it as if you went to a restaurant and it was good, or got a good deal on a car. You would share that with your friends or people that you knew right. <br>  I feel believing in God is the same way I enjoy God and I want to share that with others. I will admit there are Christians out there that do force their idea's, beliefs, on others, but so do atheists, criminals, drug users, people in general have opinions and feelings. All I'm saying is that as a Christian God has always been there and supported me in my life and I have so much admiration and respect for God that I want everyone to have something they can rely on too. Still, you don't have to take my word for anything after all. Everything in life is a suggestion nothing can become anything without an action. I hope this answers your question.|`|SBL1t3ZSaa	Most Christians just refuse to believe that there are many paths to God, not just one path, "their path". I don't mean that in a nasty way I truly believe it, and In my opinion they are so brain washed by their religious beliefs that their way is "the only way" they have gotten to the point where the only thing they can focus on is *saving you* It's almost like they have been programmed to do one thing and one thing only, and they have forgotten all the other words their New Testament says Jesus spoke about how to treat others.<br>  <br>  "Judge not lest ye be judged" <br>  <br>  Christianity is the only religion that says if you don't accept their teaching and their beliefs that Jesus is your lord and savior who suffered and died so that your sins could be forgiven you are going to burn in hell for all eternity, and most Christians are very judgmental on anyone that will not accept the teachings and the beliefs of their religion, even if the person they are condemning to hell does believe in God, it does not matter to them if you will not accept Jesus as God. This is a factual truth because I am that person. I believe in God, The God of the Hebrew Bible. <br>  <br>  Most Christians say that they don't judge others, they are only witnessing, that is not true. If they were true Christians they would remember all of Jesus' teachings including;<br>  <br>  Matthew 10:4) If anyone does not receive you or listen to what you have to say, leave that house or town, and once outside it shake its dust from your feet.<br>  <br>  Mark 6:11) If anyplace will not receive you or hear you, shake its dust from your feet in testimony against them as you leave.<br>  <br>  Luke 9:5) When people will not receive you leave that town and shake its dust from your feet as a testimony against them.<br>  <br>  Most Christians are the ones going around judging everyone else, trying to convert everyone, condemning everyone, but they expect people to respect them when they show no respect to anyone.|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	look i personally agree with you, being a christian myself, i apologize for all the christians out there who have either judged yall or tried to force our beliefs on yall..

An atheist who walks in love is more "Christ-like" then a rude pushy "law-giver" of religion.  Christ never pushed himself on anyone.  He just said what he had to and let conversion happen on its own course.  Notice the only people Christ ever had heated discussions with were religious zealots who only had a form of godliness, not the real thing.  He didnt argue with them, nor try and convert them.

How can I cope when I have ill feelings toward another? Is it okay to want God to even the score? Does forgiving imply forgetting? When I wrong someone, what, besides asking for forgiveness, can I do? Is it ever right to overlook the wrong things people do? Is it right to not get mad but to get even instead? If we forgive a person who committed a crime, should they be prosecuted? What does a genuine apology sound like? What about wrongs done in ignorance ("Father, forgive them for they know not what they do)?<br>  <br>  Main Thought: Forgiveness is conditional, but what do we do when people don't meet the conditions?<br>  <br>  Forgiveness, In It's Fullest Sense, Requires Repentance on the Part of the Offender <br>  What forgiveness really is: Re-establishment of the relationship like it was before the offense occurred...release of the wrong done...forgetting <br>  Many people call "letting something go" forgiving...real forgiveness addresses issues.<br>  <br>  Proposition One: We forgive as God has forgiven us (Ephesians 4:32). <br>  So take a moment and actually THINK about how God forgives, WHO He forgives, and WHEN He forgives.<br>  <br>  If God automatically forgave everyone unconditionally, everyone would be saved. No one would be lost. God's forgiveness is therefore NOT unconditional, but conditional...that is the pattern for us.<br>  <br>  God is not ashamed to say He has not forgiven the non-repentant, neither should we!<br>  <br>  Proposition Two: God Does NOT Forgive Us if We Do Not Meet the Condition of Repentance (Confession)—1 John 1:8-9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." <br>  Proposition Three: God Does Not Hold Us to A Higher Standard of Forgiveness Than He Does Himself <br>  Though sometimes repentance is assumed, some Scriptures clearly declare that we are to forgive an individual when he/she repents <br>  Luke 17:3 So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him." <br>  Principles of Interpretation: <br>  The brief is interpreted in light of the lengthy; truth vs. whole truth (prayer) <br>  The context provides us with a foundation upon which latter texts add, but do not subtract; so, in other words, verses like 1 Corinthians 13:5 are interpreted in light of 1 Corinthians 5:9, not the other way around. <br>  Interpret the short statements in light of the longer, more detailed ones<br>  <br>  restitution should be made when possible (Luke 19:8; Rov.14:9 NIV) <br>  Credibility Is A Related But Separate Issue; Forgiveness Does Not Mean Instant TRUST. <br>  Forgiveness does not immediately mean the re-establishment of credibility. <br>  2 Corinthians 7:18 <br>  Luke 3:7-9 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?  Produce fruit in keeping with repentance." <br>  An unfaithful spouse (Matthew 19) <br>  John Mark (Acts 15:36-41 and 2 Timothy 4:11). <br>  Can you forgive without trusting? You can Initiate the forgiving process. <br>  Part II: Credibility and Ignorance<br>  <br>  Questions we will attempt to answer in this series include: How can I cope when I have ill feelings toward another? Is it okay to want God to even the score? Does forgiving imply forgetting? When I wrong someone, what, besides asking for forgiveness, can I do? Is it ever right to overlook the wrong things people do? Is it right to not get mad but to get even instead? If we forgive a person who committed a crime, should they be prosecuted? What does a genuine apology sound like? What about wrongs done in ignorance ("Father, forgive them for they know not what they do)? <br>  <br>  Last week we answered: Do I have to forgive someone who has not repented?  Our answer was "no," and even implied you really cannot HONESTLY do so in instances of great offense without repentance. <br>  <br>  Proposition One: We forgive as GOD has forgiven us (Ephesians 4:32)<br>  <br>  Proposition Two: God Does NOT Forgive Us if We Do Not Meet the Condition of Repentance (Confession)—1 John 1:8-9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." <br>  <br>  Proposition Three: God Does Not Hold Us to A Higher Standard of Forgiveness Than He Does Himself—see Luke 17:3 <br>  <br>  Today, we shall address two issues on the fringe of the subject of forgiveness, two issues we need to understand clearly. <br>  <br>  The Issue of Credibility <br>  You don't need to immediately trust someone you have forgiven... <br>  Restitution should be made when possible (Luke 19:8; Rov.14:9) <br>  2 Corinthians 7:18 <br>  Luke 3:7-8 <br>  <br>  Please read this to understand the meaning of true forgiveness<br>  <a href="http://www.highlandpc.com/sermoutl/forgvcnd.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.highlandpc.com/sermoutl/forgv...</a>|`|Wr09qsYMaa	Well since God is in your mind (take that either way) it is true.

The Book of Enoch--an OT scripture that used to be included in the Christian OT-- is all about angel lore (it tells the story of the war in heaven and the fall of Lucifer).

Dd0muPF6aa	Many so-called "Christians" say that the Bible's Adam and Eve story is just a myth. But reading the entire Bible will tell an honest reader that God's Word revolves around the story of the first man Adam.<br>  <br>  The Holy Scriptures start out by telling us how God lovingly prepared the Earth  before He put the first man Adam on it. On the first to the fifth creative day, God made light, a comfortable atmosphere, bodies of water, trees and vegetation, luminaries in the sky, flying creatures and the fishes. On the sixth day, he created the animals and then the first man, Adam. Later God created Eve as a complement of Adam.[Genesis 1.1-31]<br>  <br>  God placed Adam and Eve in a paradise garden called Eden. They were given the assignment to multiply and make the whole Earth a paradise [Gen 1.28; 2.15]<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were to live forever. Further, God gave them a law which impressed on them the fact that they have freewill and that obedience to God will keep them living forever. [Gen 2.16-17]<br>  <br>  That law prohibited them from eating the fruit of "the tree of the knowledge of good and bad". Disobedience would mean death as penalty.<br>  <br>  The tree was literal. Further, it symbolized God's right to determine what is "good and bad" for them being their designer and Life-giver. In other words, God's right to give them laws and govern them. <br>  <br>  Adam and Eve's obedience would have shown their appreciation and love for God as their life source,  and their respect for His right to rule over mankind.<br>  <br>  God created hundred millions of spirit persons called "angels" in heaven before man came into existence. One of them nurtured the wrong desire to be "like God". He wanted to be worshiped. So he made himself Satan which literally means "opposer" and Devil (lit. "slanderer").<br>  <br>  Gen 3.1-6 tells us that Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve. This unseen rebellious person spoke behind a serpent to hide his true identity while slandering God saying He lied to Adam and that as a ruler He was selfishly withholding something good to His subjects.In short, Satan raised moral issues against God's manner of ruling.[Rev 12.9]<br>  <br>  Sadly, Adam and Eve believed the serpent (Satan) more than they believed their Life-giver. God's law would have given  them opportunities to show their love for their Creator by their obedience. On the contrary, their disobedience showed they rejected God's rule. They wanted to be independent from God, determining on their own what is "good and bad" for them. So, today humankind is separated from God and on self-rule.<br>  <br>  God in his great wisdom and justice, implemented the law. Adam and Eve "died" as penalty for disobedience of the law. But because of God's mercy, He came up with a plan to save mankind from death and restore what Adam lost--a fine standing before God, God's rule, the Paradise and everlasting life.<br>  <br>  In Gen 3.15, the first prophecy in the Bible, God promised  a "seed" for the salvation of Adam's offsprings. For many generations God progressively revealed who that "seed" was.[ Gen 21.12; 22.16-18; 28.14; Samuel 7.12-16]. It was the subject of many prophecies in the Bible, e.g. that of Psalms, Isaiah, Daniel and the minor prohets to name a few.<br>  <br>  Eventually, Bible accounts revealed the promised "seed" to be Jesus Christ who "gave his life in exchange for many". After providing his ransom sacrifice, Jesus was resurrected by his Father to heaven awaiting his time to be enthroned as God's appointed king. <br>  <br>   In the near future, Jesus will apply the life-giving power of his ransom sacrifice by saving faithful millions in Armageddon and leading them to everlasting life during his glorious reign of 1000 years [Rev 20.6]. <br>  <br>  Even billions of the dead will be resurrected to be given the chance to live a new life in a restored Paradise on earth! [John 5.28,29; Rev 20.12,13]<br>  <br>  So we see that the story of Adam and Eve is the foundation on which the whole story of the Bible rests. Had our first parents not rebelled against God, they should still be living today. There would not be a need for a Saviour. The Holy Bible, if still needed to be written, will be wholly different.<br>  <br>  No, the story of Adam and Eve is NOT A MYTH AT ALL.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  for Bible answers to your question(s) pls send in your email.  cheers...|`|4VouLn4waa	God made adam, put him in the garden, saw that he was lonely, took one of adam's ribs and made eve out of it, they lived happy, god told them not to eat from the tree of knowledge, then satan took the form of a serpent and tempted eve to eat fruit from the tree, she ate it then gave some to adam and they were both thrown out of the garden forever. This is women are afraid of snakes and why we wear clothes. <br>  Doesnt that make so much sense? Instead of focusing on this nonsense try doing a project about evolution|`|hr4zqzLJaa	Read Genesis. It is the source. Not the stories on Internet <br>  <br>  At first Adam and Eve did obey God. But then a serpent or a snake spoke to Eve one day. Of course, a serpent cannot speak all by itself. It was an angel that made it seem as if the serpent was speaking. That angel had begun to think bad things. He wanted Adam and Eve to worship him. He wanted them to do the things that he said. He wanted to take God’s place.<br>  <br>  So that bad angel put wrong ideas into the mind of Eve. He said to her: ‘God did not tell you the truth. You will not die if you eat from that tree. You will become wise like God.’ Would you have believed what that voice said?—<br>  <br>  Eve had no right to believe what the serpent said. Everything she had was from God. But now she began to want something that God had not given her. She ate from the tree. Then she gave some to Adam.<br>  <br>  Adam did not believe what the serpent said. But his wanting to be with Eve was stronger than his love for God. So he ate from the tree too.—Genesis 3:1-6.<br>  <br>  What was the result?— God had not lied. Life does depend on obedience to him. So Adam and Eve died. And they brought death to all mankind.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that the angel that lied to Eve is called Satan the Devil. He is the enemy of God. And he is our enemy too.—Revelation 12:9.|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	The story is in Genesis Chapters One and Two.  It is pretty straight forward.  There is only one biblical version.  But, here is it in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  God created Adam and Eve with the ability to fellowship with their Creator.  God placed them in a beautiful environment and perfection reigned.  Then Satan suggested to Eve that God was perhaps holding back from giving her something she would want and should have.  Eve fell for it.  <br>  <br>  That something was the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil.  For reasons we may not fully understand God told them they could eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden - but not of that tree.  Of course, that was the tree Eve ate from.  Then she suggested Adam partake as well, and he did.<br>  <br>  The result was literally earth-shattering.  Sin entered the world.  From that point on, the Bible points to the need for a Savior, and looks forward to the Messiah - Jesus Christ, who is called the Second Adam.  That's the story of the Bible.|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	The link below has a short and concise version for you.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Moral of the story: God hates intelligence... or fruit.|`|AA12238733	All you need to understand is that Adam & eve is a myth, a fairytale.|`|p5aZtaiwaa	Adam had sex with Eve and they populate|`|jQXza1aSaa	This is what it says:<br>  <br>  God made Earth<br>  God made Man<br>  Man lived in Paradise<br>  Man lived Naked and Proud<br>  God made Man a Wife<br>  Man's Wife talked to snake<br>  Wife ate fruit (most likely a fig)<br>  Wife made Man eat fruit<br>  Both gained Knowledge<br>  Both had revelation of being naked and covered up<br>  God got Pissed<br>  Paradise was lost<br>  <br>  For the record, the devil (by any of his names) is not mentioned at all in the book of Genesis.

Adam and Eve were told not to eat from the tree of knowledge. But they had free will and Eve was tricked by the serpent and she ate the fruit and gave it to Adam. Then, since they were naked, the made clothes and put it on. When they ate the fruit, their eyes were open and noticed they were naked. For that God banned them from the garden of Eden. They settle outside of it and they had 2 children. Cain and Abel.

6aIuZZi7aa	There aren't any protection as rituals outlined by Anton LaVey in the book The Satanic Bible. But it depends on what you wish to "protect" yourself from during ritual. If you wish to protect yourself from being cursed by another witch, then you could perform the ritual as outlined in the book The Satanic Witch, or you could create your own ritual. But if it is to protect yourself from "impersonal entities", as Anton LaVey wrote in the book The Satanic Rituals, "the magician should treat the entities he calls upon as friends and companions, for even an "impersonal" device responds better to a conscientious and respectful user."<br>  <br>  Edit: I find the best way to protect myself from curses is not to piss people off. ;-)|`|iQZpv42raa	It is included in compassion. Sorry, I have to hide my books, so I couldn't give direct quotation, but you can guess by it's meaning. <br>  Also there is some kind of protection ritual in Satanic Witch<br>  Generally, Lavey's rituals are very free-styled. You don't have strictly follow the same order.<br>  If you want to protect yourself , use compassion invocation and then invite something by yourself, that you think is most relevant for protection.|`|fpDVR5a9aa	Maybe|`|QyAyQf3Laa	----------------------<br>  Magic/Sorcery<br>  <br>  Leviticus 19: 26<br>  <br>  "YOU must eat nothing along with blood.

For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you.  You should prove yourself faultless with Jehovah your God.<br>  <br>  Acts 18: 18 - 19<br>  <br>  And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly.

And they calculated together the prices of them and found them worth fifty thousand pieces of silver.<br>  -----------------------|`|IKb6RYmNaa	True Satanism is not limited to what is written in the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey as he didn't invent Satanism. He just made one branch of it popular. True Satanism is based upon the Original Pagan (NOT WICCAN) Religions predating Judeo-Christianity and anton lavey by thousands of years. Everything of our ancestors was deemed as "evil" and "Satanic" by the Catholic church and this was done to keep the unknowing populace afraid and enslaved.<br>  <br>  If you want real Satanic Magick I suggest you research Spiritual Alchemy books like "Initiation into Hermetics" by Franz Bardon or such sites like www.joyofsatan.org and other Spiritual Satanic sources.<br>  <br>  Protection, destruction, lust....there is NO limit in True Satanism.

After his death, those who he preached to carried on his ministry and Christianity in the form of the Catholic Church and Catholicism.

If you started counting now you would die before you reached that number. <br>  <br>  Sir Fred Hoyle a mathematician and astronomer calculated that the probability of one simple enzyme forming by chance is 10 to the power of 20 (one with twenty zeros behind it), to 1. Hence for one cell to form, about 2000 enzymes are needed, which makes the probability of the first self replicating cell forming by random movement of atoms as 10 to the power of 40000 to 1. One bitter critic of Hoyle begrudgingly says that that this figure is 'probably not overly exaggerated'. <br>  <br>  It has been said that this is as likely as a cyclone going through a junkyard and producing a fully functional jumbo jet. <br>  <br>  It is also claimed that life came from another planet. Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick recognized the problem of the extremely low probability that life could come from non-life on earth. He concluded that the earth was not old enough, and postulated that life may have come from another planet. Hence in order for us then to have a 1000 to 1 chance of life forming by itself, (and lets assume that an asteroid will definitely take the life to earth) there would need to be roughly 10 to the power of 38970 planets out there (fairly close to us) capable of supporting life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/27407/creation/chances.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/27407/crea...</a>|`|zM327P5Taa	The laws of the physical universe NEVER existed before the big bang.

HZqi9XyJaa	A Christian is someone who professes belief in Jesus as Christ and who lives according to the teachings of Jesus.<br>  <br>  The word Christian is used three times in New Testament (Acts 11:26; Acts 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16). Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.  <br>  <br>  The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word.  <br>  <br>  Just as you can identify a tree by it's fruits, so you can identify people by their actions. Matthew 7:20 <br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfullness, gentleness, and self control.

Christian: Who follows Christ .<br>  (1 Peter 2:21) 21?In fact, to this [course] YOU were called, because even Christ suffered for YOU, leaving YOU a model for YOU to follow his steps closely.?<br>  <br>  Jesus said to his followers: “You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you.” (John 15:14) Since Jesus’ teachings affected all aspects of their lives, Christ’s disciples initially referred to their religion as “The Way.” (Acts 9:2) Soon thereafter, “[they] were by divine providence called Christians.” (Acts 11:26) This new name they bore meant that they believed that Jesus was the Son of God, who had transmitted to mankind the will of his heavenly Father. This belief led them to follow a way of life that differed from that of the world around them.<br>  <br>  Christ’s teachings moved his followers to follow Bible teachings, which meant avoiding “fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, .?.?. drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these.” (Galatians 5:19-21; Ephesians 4:17-24) The apostle Paul reminded Corinthian Christians that some of them had once practiced these very things. Then he added: “But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—1?Corinthians 6:9-11.<br>  <br>  E.?W.?Barnes relates in his book The Rise of Christianity: “In its early authoritative documents the Christian movement is represented as essentially moral and law-abiding. Its members desired to be good citizens and loyal subjects. They shunned the failings and vices of paganism. In private life they sought to be peaceful neighbours and trustworthy friends. They were taught to be sober, industrious and clean-living. Amid prevailing corruption and licentiousness they were, if loyal to their principles, honest and truthful. Their sexual standards were high: the marriage tie was respected and family life was pure.” Such were aspects of being a Christian in the early days.<br>  <br>  Another distinctive sign of early Christianity was its zealous evangelizing work. Christ commanded his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” (Matthew 28:19,?20) Jean Bernardi, a professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France, noted: “[Christians] were to go out and speak everywhere and to everyone. On the highways and in the cities, on the public squares and in the homes. Welcome or unwelcome. To the poor, and to the rich encumbered by their possessions. .?.?. They had to take to the road, board ships, and go to the ends of the earth.”|`|MOcAhQXcaa	I'm a Christian and here is what I personally believe being a Christian is.A Christian is someone who has asked Jesus Christ to save them from their sins& 2 come into their heart.

2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	>> If god is so good, WHY did he let my daughter die?<br>  <br>  ????????Before I say what I must, I'll let you know that I understand your pain perfectly -- though differently.  How can I say that?  My 17-year-old son was suddenly diagnosed with 4th-stage cancer.  Ten months later, he was dead -- just three months after turning 18 years old.  I did everything... prayer, anointing, you name it.<br>  <br>  ????????My son was also very spiritually oriented.  He loved to read his Bible.  Yet, I had to watch him waste away, suffer, and die a death of asphyxiation as the cancer filled up his insides and squeezed the life out of him from the inside.  But through it all, I felt not one moment of anger at God, nor questioned His Will and His Plan for my son.<br>  <br>  ????????Why?  Because I know that it is not God's will for *anyone* to die.  I know that it is God's Will for *everyone* to live in peace, happiness, and perfect pleasure in a perfect world.  But this world isn't perfect.  This world is marred by sin.  Things happen in this world of which God is not the source.  There is another being in this world whose sole mission it is to seek, kill, and destroy.  God's Son came to seek and to save that which was lost.<br>  <br>  ????????So, what is the answer for you?  The only thing you have to do is to not forget what you have always known about God and compare that to what you have always known about the devil.  Of those two beings, with which one's character is the death of your daughter more in line?  Hang on to that.  Don't forget that.  Have faith in God that He will make all things right in the end.  Remember...  We all have free will -- free choice.  We don't know your daughter's reason for her choice.  God does.  Your only duty is to make your choice as to whom you will serve: come what may.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Why do you think God let her die? We have free will and it sounds like your daughter had a mental condition..  I hope you find peace somewhere somehow.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	So tell me, has staying bitter all these years been any help?<br>  <br>  For a start, she might have been your daughter, but she wasn't YOUR daughter.<br>  You didn't own her, you didn't even make her; you had her and you had time with her, but she was never, never yours to keep.<br>  <br>  If and when you eventually come to this understanding, you will begin to find peace for yourself.<br>  <br>  BTW, I lost my infant son due to natural circumstances on May 12, 1996. It was Mother's day of all days so I know a little bit about what I'm talking about.|`|M3sVQm2Maa	I am so, so, so, so sorry about your daughter. That is heartbreaking and tragic. I don't know if you care to hear an atheist's perspective, but one of the things that led me to atheism is that I could not reconcile a loving, all-powerful god with all the suffering and tragedy in the world.  It made no sense.<br>  I kept thinking that if I prayed hard enough that somehow things would work out. Sometimes they don't. There is no god involved, that's just life. <br>  Your daughter is gone, and anybody who hasn't experienced that themselves has no right to give you platitudes about god or to tell you she's in a "better place" or any of that junk.<br>  <br>  Some of us seem to get more than our share of heartache, that's why I think it's up to us to help each other when we can. No god is going to do it for us. I'd rather someone give me a hand or a hug than tell me they're going to pray for me. <br>  <br>  You've suffered a tremendous loss...and I hope you will reach out to trusted friends for support, seek out a bereaved parents group in your area, talk to a counselor, actively do things to help yourself through your grief. Plant a tree in your daughter's name, speak at a local school to raise awareness about suicide...but do not try to deal with this all alone. It's too much for one person.|`|5512018d53cae3a1c939ecb7fdca2d55aa	My son died in February of 1993, he was only 8 months old. His mother had put him to bed the night before, around midnight. She tied him up with the blanket because he was a little fussy that night. She left him to sleep on his side, according to her. I found him around 4 AM, face down on his bloody pillow, with his hands tied to his sides. If she hadn't tied him, he would have been able to push himself up from the pillow. Now the "experts" say don't give your babies pillows, because too many have lost their young lives because of pillows. Sacramento County Coroner's office could not determine the cause of death...even with the evidence provided, and filed him as a victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.<br>  You want to know what she said the night before when I had asked her (for the very first time in his life) to put him to bed (because normally, I was the one who put the children to bed)? She said, "Fine, you'll never have to hear him cry again!" I thought she was just being dramatic...and I would have put him to bed myself, but felt unusually tired that night since I had been studying for a Chinese test I would have taken the next day.<br>  I questioned God. I asked God to let me go instead of my son. I could not understand so much...more than a decade later, and I do understand so much more. I cannot blame God for the actions of my ex-wife that caused the death of our son. If he had not died, perhaps he would be suffering more now because of some of the other things his mother did to us (including his two surviving sisters and his half-brother). God did not cause the death of my son, but he allowed me 8 months to get to know him, and be blessed by his unselfish love...when I took my son to be dedicated at church a few weeks earlier, the photographs of the ceremony and afterward, that day showed a light on his face coming down from above. The Sabbath before he died, he actually kneeled and folded his hands and closed his eyes when it was time to pray, like the older children in his Sabbath School class did. He was 8 months old, and I am a better person for having had the opportunity to spend time with him. He's at rest, with no suffering from a broken family...no manipulation from his mother...and he did not have to endure the hardships his step-mother put on his sisters, nor did he have to raise himself like his half-brother did after his mother took him when she left our family.<br>  *ADDENDUM* I am still surprised about the fact that she got away with a heinous thing, and is allowed to go to Europe so she doesn't have to pay any child support.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The Psalms are full of poems dealing with such things. Why does a loving God let such astounding suffering happen? <br>  <br>  I have another question. Why does God let anyone die?<br>  <br>  No doubt, God could have made the universe in such a way that nothing ever went wrong. But he didn’t. He created a world that is free to be itself—and to express its identity in continually fresh and creative ways. For some reason, he thinks that is good.<br>  <br>  Maybe that’s because it takes such a world, a wild and free world, to be the breeding ground for things God values in human beings—things like courage, devotion, loyalty, self-sacrifice, kindness, generosity, hope, trust. By anybody’s reckoning these are a few of the noblest features of humanity. Would they be in a world without risk, danger, calamity—and death? And where would love be? Love isn’t just a matter of getting along. Love is made real in the crucible of suffering, of self-sacrifice, of loyalty and devotion against the odds. <br>  <br>  As much as we hate to admit it and hate to talk about it and throw stones at those who do, we all die. We all die of something. Whether we die of "natural causes" or of "natural disasters" makes little difference in the end. Either way, we die, and nothing will stop it, regardless of how kind we are or how mean we are or how smart, careful or wise we are. But the good news is, regardless of how or when we die, Jesus resurrects the dead.<br>  <br>  God could stop all natural movement of earth, air and water. He could stop humans from making mistakes, making unwise decisions, being selfish, or stubborn or rude. God could have made a "Stepford" creation in which everything worked automatically. But he didn’t. God created a world in which something far more valuable than long physical life could exist. He made a world in which love can exist and grow. In love, humans pull together and respond to suffering and calamity. In love, humans forgive one another, help one another, encourage one another and stand by one another.|`|8Fh8Pmahaa	I do not have answers to your questions, but I have a few thoughts (an inkling or two) that I use when thinking about such things.<br>  Suicide is a very difficult topic. I have often thought about suicide and about doing it throughout my life. I also have a relationship with God.  Nonetheless, God lets me struggle through these matters, as well as other things.  There is so much that doesn't make any sense to me. The tree that grows the deepest roots is the one that is most blown around by the various storms.  I think it is also so with the life of the person. Even though I go through sufferings, it simply causes me to go more to God. I don't blame God for what's going on here, but I do look to God for strenght to get through whatever is happening and wisdom when I am confused by life events.  I don't get answers. A lot of things still don't make sense. But God can make sense of it all and I suppose that God's plans will not be hindered by what we do.  You know, the thought occurred to me that even though your daughter killed herself, there is the possibility that she is with the Lord, especially since you faithfully prayed for her. No one in this world can know for sure what the final outcome is for any individual who dies - but the Lord knows and gives the final verdict. Maybe you can start from this basis of hope as a beginning point for healing. I hope this helps.|`|cbEa0uKNaa	The bible says that "they world is in the power of the wicked one". So that means the devil is ruleing the world today which is obvious so much bad is going on. He wants us to feel that god is terrible because if your not on gods side your on his because he can make us think some crazy things sometimes. We are suffering because of satan remember in the garden of eden satan tempted eve through a serpant. So he is called the father of the lie, so dont let him control your thinking. I am so sorry about your daughter but their isnt no telling what was going on in her mind at that time. so please dont follow that path. I know that must be a terrible thing to get over and it isnt going to be easy and you may not ever who knows. BUt dont allow him to make you believe that god has caused this to happen and anger will overwhelm you and that isnt a good state to be in......i wish you luck, just look forward, we cant change anything that has happen we cant just have positive attitude to change things that may happen in the future.|`|542e578901be4c8e7844768f8ea65df9aa	wages of sin is death Rms 6:23<br>  <br>  Read also Eph 6:12<br>  <br>  Romans 8:22<br>  <br>  God loves us and in that love, he grants us choice, to do as we please, including, rape, murder, terrorism, suicide etc.<br>  <br>  But also the good things<br>  <br>  We cause our own problems, Not GOD!!!<br>  <br>  We need faith in Christ, so that we will not weakened by the earth the flesh or the devil.<br>  <br>  You did not have a firm relationship with God, If you did you would not blame him for your daughters choice!!

Why is there death in the first place?<br>  <br>  Romans 5:12: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.<br>  <br>  Death comes because of sin. Christine, if your daughter chose to kill herself, how is that God's fault? <br>  <br>  Just because your daughter died does not mean your prayers were not heard. Why...why will YOU let this destruct your faith? <br>  <br>  Do you remember Hurricane Katrina? It wiped out whole families. In many cases, all were killed except for one member. How do you think they feel? <br>  <br>  We should not abandon God because of the results of evil. The whole creation groans and travails in pain because of sin and evil. You are not alone and your struggle and I'm sure it is one heck of a struggle.<br>  <br>  Ask God for healing. You will come out of this a Conquerer. Don't give up. Keep trusting God. God LOVES you.

It destroyed my mother with grief and, at a time when there was no counselling, my life was irrevocably changed and affected by this tragedy.<br>  <br>  I was moved from school to school because of anti-social behaviour after her death and, eventually, upon the recommendation of my wonderful old GP, was placed in a private school, where I received a much better education and have travelled the world many times over using this bedrock of learning.<br>  <br>  I am trying to emphasise the broader picture and the positive side to any negative.  It is so very, very hard to see through one's tears but, I firmly believe, there is a higher purpose and all things here are merely stepping stones to a better way in the future.<br>  <br>  It took me 50 years to resign myself to the fact that, had my sister not died, my life would have taken a far different course, as would my mother's life and only now do I begin to have come to terms with the path taken.<br>  <br>  It is said that, there can be no joy without knowledge of sorrow and I wish you peace and that you may be able to reconcile yourself to your loss..

5yFnjp56aa	Sikh religion unlike others does not go for rat race of converting. Guru just placed a simple test before anyone want to go for bigger picture ie realizing God in this life. Spiritually enlightened people in every religion kept their hairs uncut(eg Jesus , Muhammad, kabir, Ravidass, Buddha etc.).|`|0Mi6AQwxaa	Who told you all that BS ? <br>  <br>  Almost every 'Khalsa' breaks his religious laws. Of the 5 K’s the Kesh ( hair and beard, eyebrows, body hair ) is shorn by a massive ( maybe 99 %, yes 99 % ) majority of the young 'Khalsa', weather they are in the UK or the fields of Punjab . Even the 'Khalsa's who keep the hair will reject 3 other physical symbols. For convenience sake - without batting an eyelid. Ask a religious 'Khalsa', - if you take so much trouble over maintaining your hair at the right length, do you keep ‘the Kacha’ ( large undergarment / drawers ) or do you wear a Calvein Klein brand of underwear. Do you keep ‘the Kanga’ ( comb ) of the right length or only a miniature Kanga – for convenience sake ? The ‘Kara’ is convenient so almost everyone ( including I ) wear it.|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	It's part of living with what god has given you I think.

I pray for them and cry out to God :)|`|LJkPRqN0aa	innocence should not be punished with death, murderers and people that are not innocent that have done a horrific crime should be punished. its not that hard of a concept to understand.|`|AA11849917	I can only guess that you don't know the difference between an innocent baby and a depraved murderer!<br>  <br>  What exactly does that say about YOU?  Just what kind of a monster Are you?  (You make me sick!)|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	We prefer to wait until a human being is found guilty in a court of law of a serious crime before killing him.|`|fbrdhY1aaa	I suppose you could look at it like this:  Babies (or fetuses, whichever you prefer) are innocent and haven't committed crimes punishable by law.  However, murderers have killed another human being for one reason or another and should be punished for it.  It's innocence vs. an eye for an eye.  <br>  <br>  In any case, I don't like the idea of capital punishment because we're judging people and are ultimately murderers ourselves.  However, you can't just keep them locked up and force the tax-payers to support them for the rest of their lives (especially with the way the jails are filling up around here), but you can't put them back on the streets either... So, what do you do?|`|dmCAiuMGaa	Who do so many people care more about the lives of sadistic brutal child rapist-murderers than they do about the lives of unborn babies?|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I suppose they delineate the two by identifying the former as innocent and the latter as guilty.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Why are so many who oppose capital punishment for abortion??<br>  <br>  Either way, I oppose both|`|6TuyXuJRaa	They believe in the innocence of a child.

God makes it clear that if man sheds blood (an old fashioned way for saying kill) then by man shall his blood be shed.  The Bible also makes it clear that the unborn child is designed by God and is already human.<br>  <br>  The abortionist, technically, should then have his (her) blood shed because he (she) shed the innocent blood of a human.  There is nothing two-faced about it.  A child whose life is ended by an abortionist had no choice in the matter.  A grown person who willfully kills another made that choice, and should therefore pay the consequence.|`|82AAOxCfaa	im not against capital punishment because it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. if a person INTENTIONALLY murdered someone else, then deal with the punishment that laws have to offer. if a innocent life is taken, then deal with the consequences that follow. unborn babies have not and can not commit crimes that are punishable by the law. <br>  <br>  i will fight for those who are being innocently murdered. its not a double standard nor is it hypocrisy. i believe in justice. i will fight for those who are wrongfully put to death. unborn babies to senior citizens.|`|3BB9drn6aa	I can only imagine that those who are against abortion believe in the life of the fetus which develops very quickly to show signs of life. And being that life is innocent without choice of what is done them him or her while in the belly of the mother. However, once a child is born, and grows, each individual in the world makes conscious choices about what they do; be it right or wrong. They were given life to begin with, and had every opportunity in this world to do good for themselves and for others if they so chose. <br>  <br>  But, once a person starts taking lives by murder of others, and are condemned to death, then that was by their own choice. A fetus or unborn child has no choice, but as anyone grows, we all make decisions right or wrong that will determine our fate. Bottom line, fetus/unborn child totally innocent; criminal who murders by his own choice and actions doomed to death if caught in a state that has capital punishment.|`|4LeHbW2raa	I think its because they realize that not every baby will grow up to be a homicidal lunatic. Some babies may actually do something useful when they grow up . They may grow up to become scientists, doctors, engineers , workers and contribute to the betterment of society. They may also grow up to be wall st. bankers and ceos  .. but i guess you need to take the bad with the good. I am all for women being allowed to decide whether they want to have a child or not but is it really that difficult to differentiate between an unborn child which cannot even claim its right to live and serial murders/rapists/ child molesters ?|`|o35cQe3Iaa	People are not against capital punishment because a criminal who has done something very bad (like killing or raping someone) is getting executed.  They are against abortion because a baby (who has done nothing) is getting executed.  I personally am against abortion and for capital punishment.|`|SMv0Xj20aa	because those innocent babies never did anything... it's that girls fault for getting prego... she should deal with the consequences. same with the capital punishment, that person did the crime and some of those crimes deserve death... so they should deal with the consequences|`|cs0YDOTbaa	i really like the first answer.  but i honestly think both should be legal.  <br>  <br>  if there were no law and cities of no more than 5000 people, it is highly likely that somehow or another child molesters and serial killers would mysteriously end up missing or dead.<br>  <br>  what should happen should happen.|`|DBxaU0Tjaa	Hah no clue.

Which is for your own personal benefit because if you want to continue on your spiritual path, you are most supported in doing so by those who have similar goals and ideals.  But the opposite occurs when you associate with those who don't uphold your morals, beliefs or perspective on life and God.  But please be aware this is in relation to CLOSE associates/friends.  We are to do good to all and treat everyone with respect and love.  So choosing your companions wisely does not mean you are not able to speak to other people.  <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:33 states "do not be misled.  Bad associations spoil useful habits"  Which is true.  The bad rubs off on the good, not the other way around.  That is unless the bad wants to learn how to have a life exactly like the good, and puts forth the effort to do so.  But only under those circumstances.  <br>  <br>  Those who desire God’s approval choose as their companions persons who are devoted to righteousness and truth. (2Ti 2:22) They also stop “associating [literally, mixing themselves up]” socially with members of the congregation whose way of life has led to official censure of their disorderly conduct. While continuing to manifest love toward such ones, they make it clear that they do not approve of their disorderly conduct. (2Th 3:6-15) Whereas good associates can be a real aid in one’s continuing to walk in harmony with divine wisdom, there is no denying the damaging consequences of bad association. The inspired proverb states: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (Pr 13:20; compare Pr 22:24,?25; 28:7; 29:3.) The Hebrew word ra??ah′, translated ‘have dealings with’ in Proverbs 13:20, is also rendered ‘associate with’ and is related to the Hebrew word re′a?, meaning “fellowman; companion.”—Jg 14:20; Le 19:18; Ps 15:3.<br>  <br>  That unwholesome companions are indeed hurtful to one’s welfare is evident from many Scriptural examples. Jacob’s daughter Dinah unwisely chose Canaanite girls as her associates, and this led to her being violated by Shechem, the son of a Hivite chieftain. (Ge 34:1,?2) David’s son Amnon listened to the bad counsel of his companion Jehonadab and raped his own half sister Tamar. Thus he incurred the hatred of Absalom, her full brother, who later arranged to have him murdered. (2Sa 13:3-29) Contrary to Jehovah’s commands, the Israelites began associating with the Canaanites, formed marriage alliances with them, and adopted their degraded form of worship, resulting in Jehovah’s disfavor and abandonment. (De 7:3,?4; Jg 3:5-8) Even Solomon turned from worship of Jehovah when he took worshipers of false gods as wives. (Ne 13:26) It was the influence of Baal-worshiping Jezebel that made Ahab worse than all the Israelite kings prior to his time. (1Ki 21:25) Close association with the royal house of Ahab nearly cost godly Jehoshaphat his life, and the marriage alliance that he had formed with Ahab later almost destroyed the royal house of David.—2Ch 18:1-3, 29-31; 22:10,?11.

The "YHWH" means "I AM THAT I AM" Or eternal one. The Hebrew pronunciation is lost and is probably Jehovah or yahweh. Jesus was accused of blasphemy for saying He is the "I AM". The pharisees knew that meant God YHWH. He really was God with us, Immanuel and the Alpha and Omega see Rev ch 1;8 and 1:17-18. Two places the new testament talks about God being there before time began. This is why the evolutionists can't work Him out. God is outside of time and space. When you accept Him as saviour you have the right to call Him Father just as in an earthly family you don't call your father by His name. This is one error of JW's. They worry about His name.

The usual account, however, describes them as earth-born. <br>  <br>  Orphic Hymn 70 to the Eumenides (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.) :<br>  "[Erinyes] from Zeus Khthonios [Haides] born, and Phersephone, whom lovely locks adorn."<br>  <br>  Statius, Thebaid 12. 557 (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :<br>  "[Hades] the father of the Eumenides."<br>  <br>  II) ZAGREUS<br>  <br>  Aeschylus, Fragment 124 Sisyphus (from Etymologicum Gudianum 227. 40) (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :<br>  "Now [I came] to bid farewell to Zagreus and to his sire, the hospitaler."<br>  [N.B. In this fragment Sisyphos describes his departure from the lower world. Haides, the “hospitaler of the dead,” is the husband of Persephone, and so the "father" of the chthonic Zagreus. His putative father however was Zeus.]<br>  <br>  III) MELINOE<br>  <br>  Melinoe was a chthonian goddess identified with Hekate. In Orphic myth she was born when Persephone was seduced by Zeus in the guise of her husband Haides. <br>  <br>  Orphic Hymn 71 to Melinoe (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.) :<br>  "Melinoe, saffron-veiled, terrene, who from Phersephone dread venerable queen, mixt with Zeus Kronion, arose, near where Kokytos’ mournful river flows; when, under Plouton’s [Haides’] semblance, Zeus divine deceived with guileful arts dark Phersephone. Hence, partly black thy limbs and partly white, from Plouton [Haides] dark, from Zeus ethereal bright."<br>  <br>  IV) MAKARIA<br>  <br>  Suidas s.v. Makariai (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.) :<br>  "Makaria (Blessed). Death. A daughter of Haides. And a proverb : `Go to blessedness', instead of go to misery and utter destruction. Or `Go to blessedness' is said by euphemism. Since even the dead are called `blessed ones.'"|`|AA11043457	Didn't he capture Ceres (word from which cereal comes) and take her to Hades as well until she was rescued by someone - lover or a son.<br>  <br>  I don't recall a child from the one of darkness.

To Have a tree that withdrew its fruit when he reached for it and a river of water in which he stood and to have it recede whenever he tried to get a drink.  Sure does point out what tantalize is.

HyAFA5Jpaa	What an interesting question - what kind of fight?  Any intellectual discussion between people who believe differently - whether that is God, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or any other religious belief system (including atheism) comes down to something which is not truly 'provable' - a belief.  People see facts differently - someone who believes the validity of evolution sees evidence all around, yet a creationist sees those same facts and attributes them to the creator.  I gave up arguing beliefs a long time ago - either someone is swayed by an argument - indicating the really didn't believe 'their way' to begin with, or they get far too emotional - and interpret challenge to their beliefs as an attack on them - and may respond physically.   There is far too much conflict in the world over belief - and little acceptance of differing beliefs.|`|7d4eebc1b191ad4bf37b0e895a8008bdaa	Believers of god are incapable of having such a fight/debate or discussion so don't bother.<br>  <br>  What would you call someone who believes in  and lives their life around the commands of a fictional evil characer?|`|GEfUTyi8aa	non... believers only fall from grace when they do something themselves.... they rarely listen to the enlightened.|`|AA11466759	you're weird.|`|qY9svA3taa	Agnostics because we leave open the door for the possibility of God.

It's probably a generalization, but maybe Americans tend to more self confident and sort of active and Europeans more reserved?|`|090XbTRwaa	It really depends on the area in Europe you're from -<br>  Northern Europe (Scandinavia, Germany, Holland) : blond, blue eyed.<br>  British Isles (England, Scotland, Ireland) : reddish blond/medium brown hair, pale skin. <br>  Southern Europe (Italy, South of France, Spain) : darker skin, darker eyes, usually brown to black hair.<br>  Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia) : strong features.<br>  <br>  This doesn't apply for every European of course; my dad is from Italy and he is blond and green-eyed.<br>  <br>  Maybe people didn't speak to you because you hadn't spoken first.
GGf3XRBCaa	Unfortunately, there is no easy way to determine if you are gay. There are no scientific tests or sterotypes that determine your sexuality. You will find out through experience and feelings.<br>  <br>  Most define being gay as having a strong bond or sexual attraction to another man. Others define it as a lifestyle which includes behaviors and social interactions.<br>  <br>  You should ask yourself several questions about your sexuality and sexual preferences. Do you prefer sex with a man? Are you physically attracted to men? Do you feel an emotional bond with a man? Would you consider an intimate relationship with a man?<br>  <br>  Try not to fall into the trap of stereotypes. Gay men are just as diverse as straight men. There are no mannerisms, music or clothing preferences that can define a person as gay. The Kinsey Scale is a good start in determining your sexuality.|`|ACsFkSV6aa	Well, you cant keep burying your true feelings deep inside a closest you need to come out and be true to yourself.|`|w5l7De7Daa	i know you really don't want to<br>  <br>  but tell your wife.

I was concerned that since I'm not completely repulsed about being with a woman people would say that I was faking being gay. Which is definitely not the case I also didn't want people to think that I was choosing anything when it comes to my sexuality.<br>  <br>  Shew it's confusing.|`|9xM1JPjCaa	oh my god dude!  ok i'm gay and i feel like that all the time, like especially at parties when i meet all these girls, i feel this weird attraction, like not aroused by them but like i want to kinda fool around with them or something, but its complicated cause its not the same way i'mn attracted to men|`|08dca73a192562add8559247b6523a7caa	Most definitely.

The quality that this woman seems to allegedly have is none different than your own.....it is chemistry yes...but you are an incredibly approachable person from what I have garnered on Y!A. I would have to go into my travel trunk of theories and epiphanies and say "This woman caught your eye.....but even in that ...it is not always sexual....for I...yes 'Me' am one of those incredibly approachable people and would venture to say that this lady and chemistry is what it is.....is most likely extremely approachable ...though and even though the watch word upon first glance were those of an ilk that you normally would not attend to. I have often...more often than I can count......connected with an individual who was so very different than myself....gay, bi.....no difference. No difference in gender wither...it is NOT a gender biased thing. it is the keen and wonderful matter of being able to 'connect' with another person.....good for you. better still that you shared it here. It was NOT my intention to join a Boys Only question here.....but it struck a chord..one that has proven to bring out some of the best friends of my life.....gender and proclivities not withstanding.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|fFmbBRbcaa	hahaha the only girl i have ever been attracted to was a lesbian and she fit the same description except more butch lol its weird shes sorta like an older sister to me now lol idk the attraction kinda faded away after some time interesting Duey!!!!!!!|`|DIj072Sqaa	That's happened to me as well. Some lesbians have a lot of the qualities of cute guys. As other people have mentioned attraction and sexuality aren't always related. By coming out as gay doesn't ban yourself from looking at a girl and thinking 'she's nice'.|`|N4APv37Gaa	To their looks no....but to their personality....but if theyre FUGLY no i wont, but if they look pretty hot and have a great personality(like make me laugh, etc.) then ya...but its more of like "i want to be ur bff" and not i want to F u!HAHAHAHAHAHA ;)|`|n55igpCUaa	Sexual orientation lives up to it's name.

pcHCLfZkaa	It's called stress, hun. <br>  <br>  Do you know the kind of things you enjoy doing? Surely you do. <br>  Rather, why don't you do those for a little while?<br>  <br>  If I were having insomnia of this nature (which is totally called for in my circumastances *cough*), I would read or post in my blog.<br>  <br>  Maybe look at cute puppies? :)<br>  <br>  Things that would relax me. After a while of doing these calming things, you'll get tired. And no matter the worries that pop into your head, you're not going to be able to hold your eyes open.<br>  <br>  So just be mellow. <br>  Go with the flow, and eventually drift to sleep, baby. :)|`|ErN3pbTeaa	Masturbate, then drink a beer or two, and if you don't have beer (or are not old enough). Take a sleeping pill, and then lay down. But when you lay down try focus on one thing. Don't think about words, numbers, and don't talk to yourself. <br>  Try flexing different muscle groups too. It helps relax you.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Take two Benadryl , within 30 minutes you will be out like a light!<br>  Or try warm milk!
a9r82MRIaa	Our own fear may be what's stopping us, there is a point in our own minds many of us fear to tread, like in my dreams I fly around the earth but sometimes fear going out to space. Also like when it is very dark at night and you go near an old, empty house in the middle of nowhere with noone around, as you approach, you hear a rattle in a nearby bush, this would cause you to get paranoid, you can choose to walk over to that bush and check it out or you can walk away cautiously, or you can ignore it and go into the house, but have you ever gotten a strange feeling that told you "everything you fear lies within this house, are you prepared to face it now", for what have any of us to fear but what is unknown of ourselves, that which we call "death" (happens to us all) and what else? Torture? If we could face all our fears, we would be unstoppable perhaps. But then again, perhaps "playing it safe" has a role too, it may be what keeps us alive, so long as one allows oneself to experience of infinity, one can have no fear, but in todays society, fear is the norm, one without fear may have little respect for societies rules and be thought of as "mad" perhaps...|`|8PjHFUdfaa	Yes ...

Then the spirits of life held captive emerges into freedom.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|LjsRfaskaa	I think it has more to do with the frequency we are vibrating at. Obviously we have settled into a particular range of frequencies but within that we change up and down depending on our health and outlook quite easily.<br>  <br>  But we are not as restricted in that as we think we are. We actually have full control to feel any emotion we desire. We don't have to wait for something funny to make us laugh, for example. We can just laugh for no reason at all. And the same is true for any of the emotions, we can chose to go with it or change it. This is called shape shifting. <br>  <br>  All matter vibrates at a particular dense frequency. We can pass through water because it is vibrating at a less dense frequency than we are. We can't pass through rock because the rocks frequency is more denser than ours. It's actually quite simple. <br>  <br>  Our reality is basically observed, like a really fascinating tv program we are so engrossed in, that we are there, mind body and soul. But we are not in that place we just believe we are. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.
qcQm8eIbaa	Love, spiritually.<br>  <br>  When wandering into other realms, one notices that the higher up the vibrational level one goes, the more cohesive and well put together it all is.<br>  You are happier, you feel loved. Knowledge is gaciously given.<br>  <br>  When you wander down, it's heavy and dense and not exactly dark, but with an absence of light. Base emotions are to be found. Depressive. An absence.<br>  <br>  Putting using this observation, I would speculate that Love is the very vibration that feeds us, sustains us, and helps us as beings move forward.<br>  <br>  Love is all elements rolled into one, or rather, love rolled out into the seperate elements.<br>  <br>  Love is life. Literally. Spiritually speaking.|`|KDm8kLGpaa	not god lol|`|a9r82MRIaa	Perhaps it is the light within us all that may dim but never goes out... or maybe not (theory in progress).|`|AA10554783	Sorry it's a little long but it does explain love from one standpoint.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	4. Spiritually speaking, love is an experience of being connected with all that exist ( animate and inanimate ) and being inseparable part of the flow in the connected chain.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Love is the absence of fear, so it is probably our natural spiritual state.<br>  <br>  There are only 2 emotions.  Love is one.   All the rest are based on fear of some kind.<br>  <br>  So I would say that the closer we get to pure source, and the more we are able to release the negative emotions, the closer we get to Love, which seems to be some kind of dynamic force.<br>  <br>  The closer we draw to the source the more intense this dynamic feeling is.   Can get glimpses of it in higher states of consciousness.|`|GtazNrplaa	Contained in the dynamic electrical energy transmitted by the chemical reaction to our senses of reality activated by our brains.<br>  <br>  Love is life.<br>  Like the earth<br>  Don't know how it existed.<br>  Don't know when it'll perish.<br>  And life is like that.<br>  Thus satisfying our lust for sex.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Platonic love is where we care for someone more than we care for ourselves. The love of a parent for their child for example, is built in to us, hot wired like a pc programs coding. <br>  <br>  Lust love on the other hand is chemicals (hormones) and being on the same energy frequency. Kind of takes all the fun out of it when you quantify it. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	It is an ability, not an emotion. <br>  It is a mindset, not a conscious choice. <br>  It is a feeling, not a thought.<br>  <br>  A wise man once told me "we are what we FEEL, above all else", so if I feel Love, I can BE Love (the embodiment of Love)  that's a cool thought.  :-D|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Well, none of those make any sense at all. Love is not really explainable because there is nothing else to compare it to. Some people like to break it down to a neurochemical reaction that evolved to ensure the continuance of the species, but that is not sufficient, since love exists between all kinds of people who will never reproduce and are not necessarily even attracted to each other. Love exists between parents and children, people of the same sex, the elderly, and those who just cannot reproduce. Only the parent/child relationship actually has any evolutionary value, of the ones I mentioned. The rest have nothing to contribute to the species as a whole. <br>  <br>  As Christians, we are taught that God is love. We are also taught that God is one (unity). People who love each other unite together and do for each other without thought of self. At the risk of turning loose my inner hippie, if love spread across the globe, the Kingdom of God would come, finally, as the human race would unite as one being. This is why Christ said that the number one commandment was to love God, and the second was to love thy neighbor as thyself. "On these two hang all the Law and the Prophets," He said, and He was right. If everyone did these two things, what would the world look like?|`|AA11894640	I've always FELT and maintained that love is 'the dynamic electrical energy'.  Haven't you seen the sparks fly?!?!  We hand over the switch to the loved one,  and let him/her manipulate us any which way.  A loving word,  glance or action activates us....and absence,  indifference simply puts us off and out...as good or as bad as dead then.<br>  <br>  Love is that kind of powerful flow of energy between two or many souls...|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	In biochemical terms, no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.<br>  <br>  <br>  I've never fallen in love.

But, in fact, many are asleep. Yes, psychically, spiritually, they are in a deep sleep, which can be compared to sleep on the physical plane. Deep states of sleep are necessary on the physical plane because human beings have accumulated too many toxins, or else they have greatly weakened their organism through disorderly activities. This is why they not only need much more time to recuperate but why, when they wake up, they are still groggy and sluggish. In the same way, when people accumulate impurities in their hearts and minds, when they exhaust their energies in passionate emotions, they remain for a long time in a kind of psychic torpor.

IaWlzcNsaa	Keith "Mac" MacLeod, who taught Donovan his "clawhammer" style of fingerpicking.  Donovan and MacLeod were friends who hung out with others in a group loosely defined as The St Albans Group (not a band, rather several buddies who hung out with each other).<br>  <br>  In 1968,MacLeod asked Donovan to write some songs for his band, Hurdy Gurdy.  Hurdy Gurdy was a power trio based in the UK.<br>  <br>  Donovan originally wrote Hurdy Gurdy Man for MacLeod's band, but decided to record it himself, as he envisioned it as a softer, more melodic song than the hard edged "heavy metal" version of Hurdy Gurdy (the band).<br>  <br>  As a side note, Donovan passed on MacLeod's clawhammer technique to both John Lennon and Paul McCartney whlie .they were in India studying  Transcendental Meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Examples of this clawhammer style can be heard on various songs on the Beatles White Album which was recorded shortly afterwards. Listen to Blackbird, Dear Prudence (written about Mia Farrow), Julia (about John's mother), and Mother Nature's Son for some examples of the clawhammer style.<br>  <br>  It is said that ALL  members of Led Zeppelin except Robert Plant played on this song but this has be disputed.  Some sources at the time say that Alan Parker was the lead guitarist (not Page) and that Clem Cattini was the drummer (not John Bonham) but it is widely accepted that John Paul Jones was the Bassist.  It is said that Donovan originally wanted Jimi Hendrix to record on Hurdy Gurdy Man, but he was unavailable at the time.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.macmacleod.co.uk/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmacleod.co.uk/reviews.html</a>|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.<br>  A "hurdy gurdy" is a stringed instrument that has look and sound that's a cross between a violin and mandolin.<br>  <br>  "Who is the hurdy gurdy man"? . . .A man who plays a hurdy gurdy is a "hurdy gurdy man".<br>  <br>  If songs chosen to be played on the hurdy gurdy are tranquil and are songs about love . . .Then that's where the spiritual meaning comes in<br>  <br>  A "hurdy gurdy man playing songs of love" . . .that's beautiful and spiritual.

It was a restructure of the mode and Liturgy of Worship in the Mass to attend to modern times as the Spirit moved our Catholic Church to do.

But this type of no-nonsense thinking is also what makes them deny the existence of an intelligent creative force at work here.  I won't pretend to understand that aspect - my relationship with my creator is as real, if not more so, than my relationships with humans. But we all come to our own truths in our own time. <br>  <br>  My brother Atheist says "there is no God", I say "cool - do you like waffles?"<br>  <br>  My bother Catholic says "Jesus loves you", I say "cool, pass the butter please."  :-) <br>  <br>  There is no right and wrong here guys... we're all learning exactly what we need in this lifetime.

We just haven't made contact.<br>  <br>  The problem with deity is the lack of contact when the belief is that God is all around us. If that is true, then why hasn't God revealed himself to all of mankind? That's the most logical of all questions that an atheist can ask and make a strong point.<br>  <br>  The believer is left with no answer for a very obvious reason -- we cannot, as humans, convey experiences to others. We can describe them, but if they are subjective (like tasting some substance), then unless the other person has had the same experience, we have no means to actually convey the experience.<br>  <br>  And so it becomes a matter (for some) of faith, experience for others, and lack of experience and faith (skepticism) for the atheist.<br>  <br>  It has become a matter of perspective more than anything else.<br>  <br>  I learned a long time ago that even though a person might believe that I am an honest person and that I have borne witness to my path, if that person has not had some personal experience with that path, they cannot relate to it and there isn't much I can do to help them.|`|AA12360579	I think there may or may not be life on other planets.

There is a good probability that there is intelligent life elsewhere, there are 100 billion stars in this galaxy and we can make out at least 400  billion galaxies. So that is 40000 billion stars. seeing that the star of our solar system seems to be the most typical type and size and we now know that most stars have planetary systems. Most of those stars will have rocky planets in the Earth type comfort zone. And given the propensity of carbon atoms to form complex organic molecules, I think it would be miraculous if the universe was not teeming with life.<br>  So, I can make a statistically substantial argument for the existence of extra-terrestrial life based upon known facts: show me you argument for god based on known facts, 'cause I ain't seen one that stands up yet.|`|EHozsofQaa	Well, I'm atheist and I don't believe in UFOs or Aliens, and I don't know any atheist who does either.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'll reverse your question: how can YOU believe there IS a creator behind all the universe?

28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Mythology begets more mythology. Most of the bible and nearly all of Christianity was lifted from earlier, more obscure religions. The virgin birth, the murdered/resurrected savior, demons and devils, the end of the world scenarios... all lifted from older religions. The Code of Hammurabi was used as the basis for the Ten Commandments and most of the Mosaic laws; the Code predates the Ten by almost 300 years. All the Jews did was add the spooky language of the first three commandments. Hammurabi was not a religious man, or at least, not a monotheist.<br>  <br>  Get over it, boys and girls: Your religion is nothing new.

LcRLwwSmaa	“Have you not seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it…”(Quran, 24:43)<br>   This quote taken directly from the Quran from the 24th chapter named “The light” is a perfect example of the clarity within the Quran’s poetic and highly accurate verses.  The process stated in this quote is the exact process that takes place when clouds produce rain.  It is clearly stated, and fully accurate. Above it states, “then joins them together”, this is a reference that can be specifically related to cumulus clouds, which are tiny pieces of clouds that move together to convergence zones, which form cumulonimbus clouds. This is the same cloud, which can be seen stacking up and forming a tall structure, which will then precipitate.  This example from the Quran is clear evidence of the scientific accuracy that is found throughout, however some might say that it is merely the description of nature, which can be fulfilled by an observant person, but the Quran goes further. <br>  “…And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills. The vivid flash of its lightning nearly blinds the sight.”(Quran, 24:43)<br>   This quote is also pulled straight from the same chapter, the 24th, “the light”.  This quote is yet another clear and accurate verse of the Quran that has direct scientific facts that are easily found within the meaning.  It states, and he sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky…” This line states, quite literally, that there are mountains in the sky, the reasoning for not simply saying clouds is because the cumulonimbus clouds can reach heights greater than five and a half miles in height, therefore this description is indeed very detailed.  Furthermore, within this quote there is a clear reference to hail and lightning, it states, “…And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills.” this line in fact, is not saying that He (God) strikes people with hail, but rather, “The vivid flash of its lightning nearly blinds the sight,” it is lightning that strikes.  Now why is hail and lighting being put into relation with one another in the Quran? Well it turns out that hail is a key factor in producing lightning.  When hail makes contact with water droplets, they freeze on contact and produce heat, this heat remains on the hail stone and when the hailstone makes contact with ice crystals the transfer of electrons takes place, this results in the top of the cloud becoming positively charged and the bottom of the cloud becoming negatively charged. From this process within the clouds, lightning is formed thereof, and how obvious it may seem now within the text of the Holy Quran.  Certain examples from the Quran may be considered to have easily been written by man, but this factual accuracy found in the text regarding the production of lightning is well beyond observation, at the time of the Quran’s appearance, Aristotle had his own ideas for lightning, but none came close to the truth, that hail is the source. This is clear evidence of science within the Quran and a higher knowledge providing it; only recently did we use highly advanced technology to understand this information on lightning.<br>  <br>  This is obvious proof of a higher knowledge from a higher power, to be written in the Quran 1430 years ago, and to have never been edited, well cmon, its right there for you, problem solved!|`|KEoChTcdaa	My favorite quote sums it all:<br>  <br>  "I've never seen the wind.

I also know that those who claim he doesn't don't know what they are talking about.  They say there's no evidence.  But God doesn't give the evidence they are demanding.

There will be no evidence for them because they refuse to believe.  Here is an enlightening word from Joyce Myer on this subject:<br>  <br>  Simply Believe <br>  February 21, 2009 By Joyce Myer <br>  <br>  We who first hoped in Christ {who first put our confidence in Him, have been destined and appointed to} live for the praise of His glory! Ephesians 1:12 <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ In the world, you don't believe anything until you see it. When you pray, believe that you receive, and you will get the manifestation of it. In God's kingdom you have to believe it first, and then you see it. <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ Jesus said, "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer" (Matt. 21:22 NIV). God's ear is turned towards those who pray to Him in faith. Peter was the only one who walked on water besides Jesus, but he was also the only one who got out of the boat.

U7sBZKUuaa	People today still say that a disaster is a punishment from God, and they are still wrong. Hurricanes, viruses and floods are all perfectly natural elements of the physical realm. Even Christ said that in Luke ch. 13:1-5. His disciples thought the same way and He had to correct them on it. He also included accidents and human malice.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Because the Bible historically documents God using natural disasters to punish bad people. This has happened. The Bible is God's word.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	"In the past"?<br>  <br>  You haven't heard pat robertson before, have you?|`|ExCAedp4aa	I think it was simply because they had no scientific explanation for natural disasters. They didn't understand geology, meteorology, medicine, and oceanography. So, they provided the most rational explanation for what they did know, or thought they knew.|`|lBKfmRWCaa	Today we know why things happen through science and study. Then they had no way of knowing why things happened, when a storm or flood came along it was deemed that something had angered the Gods to bring a disaster because that is the only way they could reconcile the matter.|`|kKSq5VFKaa	Sound like you need to open up the Bible and find out the truth yourself.<br>  Your talking speculation. the true answer is in the Bible.

'For as in Adam we died, so in Christ shall we live', this is physical (immortal) life. Everyone is given this gift freely. But, the spiritual life is for those who accept Jesus and follow His commandments. They who endure to the end will have their sins washed from them and their garments shall be white. Everyone else will be judged according to how they have lived their lives.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	People reap what they sow.|`|CueEJOVFaa	Well, God doesn't want to torture anyone. In the Christian view, God is long-suffering; he usually punishes after giving chances for repentance, and he doesn't rejoice in anyone's death. Using your example of Sodom and Gomorrah, God bargained with Abraham. He was willing to make concessions and save the city if there were only a few righteous there.<br>  <br>  To give a more direct answer, many Christians are agreed that, among the people who have been exposed to the Gospel, Jesus' sacrifice only covers those who have accepted it.|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  I heard a preacher speaking about this story:<br>  <br>  The preacher (woman) was in the restroom one day getting ready to go and preach. As she was dressing she got a run in her stockings. The lady in the next stall said "bragging" I have not had a run in my pantie hoses since I asked the Lord to bless them. See I used to go through a pair a day, but not anymore. "smiles"<br>  <br>  Days later she met back up with the preacher and told her. "Do you remember the time in the ladies room when I told you about the blessing GOD had given me about my pantie hoses?" The preacher replied, "Yes, Why?"<br>  <br>  The woman then told her that ever since that day she had started getting runs in her pantie hoses again. Yet she was unsure why GOD had STOPPED BLESSING HER. PUNISHING HER SO TO SPEAK.<br>  <br>  The preacher then replied. "See when GOD blesses you for whatever reason you are to go and witness to others about his good doing. NOT BRAG about it and since you BRAGGED about it GOD TOOK AWAY YOUR BLESSING."<br>  <br>  Point yes, GOD can and will punish those who DON'T fallow his word and those who rub their blessing in other peoples faces. "BRAGGING"<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :-)|`|FP3vBHUjaa	jesus paid the penalty for all man's sins, past present and future <br>  <br>  ... but unless you hung on to the coupon, you have to be punished in hell anyway|`|stHol8ITaa	Depends on who you ask.<br>  <br>  Some will say yes (which is unfair to those who got sent to Hell in the first place).<br>  <br>  Others will say no (then the scale tips and becomes unfair to those who were forgiven while everyone else burns in Hell).<br>  <br>  Then you'll have those who dismiss this all as nonsense and/or untrue.|`|PlVMilvxaa	Jesus completed the Atonement which means we can now go back to heaven if we REPENT of our own mistakes and follow Him (have faith, baptism, and receive the Holy Ghost). Those who do not repent must be punished additionally (hell). I imagine this will be mental anguish when they realize that they were wicked. But I think that wicked people often get the ugly end of the stick anyways.|`|TyJuZnZhaa	What a great question.<br>  <br>  But I have another question, "Why is it that you believe in that book and look to it for all your beliefs?"<br>  <br>  For me, I've found my own beliefs in faith. You should do the same. I'm not trying to say The Bible is something you should just forget about and not care about. I'm just saying that I honestly don't believe in it. In my opinion, finding your beliefs should be something you go through on your own. Use your own head to think about what that Bible says and think about all the possibilities.<br>  <br>  And honestly, your question is incapable of being answered.

0aN1xIxfaa	The Bible portrays sex within marriage as entirely honourable. The bringing forth of children is described as God's blessing. The reason why marriage between man and woman is the only legitimate basis for sex is that marriage is a union where the two become one flesh. The Bible uses that as an illustration for the way Christ died for the Church (i.e. people who become part of His spiritual body).<br>  <br>  People who have no respect for the God-ordained sanctity of marriage will view His rules on that to be limiting. They often rebel and try to be sexual libertines for whom nothing is taboo. That displays a totally carnal approach to sex, making it nothing more than mere physical pleasure - an entertainment, a way of gratifying sexual desires in any way they want to. At the other extreme are religious people who go beyond God's own limitations, e.g. forbidding priests, nuns or monks to marry. Then they wonder why their lusts cannot be contained. Don't blame God for that, please!|`|6jAVElX7aa	The Bible doesnt condemn sex, He told Adam and Eve to multiply and inhabit the earth. Having sexual relations within a marriage is nothing wrong with that, it is when people have extra marital affairs the children suffer, as for homosexuals they cant reproduce can they?|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	There is no contradiction. The bible says only within a foundation of a pure marriage. One man, one woman. And, mark 10:12, says divorce and remarriage is adultery. Luke 16:18, Romans 7:3 says the same. God is always right.. there is consequence for the sin.|`|PlVMilvxaa	The bible doesn't condemn having sex. In fact, it's ordained of God if it's with your spouse. If you think it does, then you're grossly misinterpreting the bible. Homosexuality on the other hand is a sin.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	No, the Bible does not condemn sex, only the rampant and uncontrolled abuse of sex with just anyone who will spread 'em for you.|`|DYnvacFVaa	Sex within marriage is encouraged, sex out of marriage is discouraged.|`|NDNnTTwIaa	indeed the bible DOES condemn sex EXTRAMARITAL sex, not martial god made a world full of freaks and it wasnt an accident HOWEVER he never made sexually immoral male or female you were created to go CRAZY with ONE person not two +.... and as for the practices of churches.... do not be swayed for church in today's era are more of the world than they should be its in the bible, it is a warning, its in revelations, read it..... dont have a bible go to biblegateway.com<br>  anywho, whatever church you are referring to is corrupt. period, they are not following the word.<br>  homosexuality is the enemy breaking down people to turn them away from god.... theres a lot to it... but it is a sin just as being a promiscuous is. the same way a promiscuity is a feeling you just  "cant help"..... never the less 1corinthians 6:9 reads........ Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders........|`|apnOVubMaa	Sex is a wonderful gift that God gave us.  We just have abit of a problem keeping it under control. So God says its better to Marry than to burn in lust. If you have sex out of marrage you will be committing adultry. One of the sins of the the 10 commandment. This is a no no.If you hold on to sin with a mind set that I'm going to do it anyway then there won't be any heaven for deliberate sinning.  If you have a problem with this then you will have to over come this with Gods help. Satans is pulling your chain.I think this is a biggy for everyone, You find a nice mate who loves God and knows I'st Corinthian 13 and treats you like this chapter. Also that will mean he will respect you and not try to jump in the sack with you. Know the Bible together and talk alot. Homo sexuality is never the right choice. God didn't burn up Sodom and Gomorrah for nothing. He thinks this behavior is an abomination to God. That one is pretty clear. Get a support group, they are out there, get a therapist or pastor or church friends you can trust that you have known them a long time.  God  Bless you in this matter love in Christ--missleslie|`|kHTdkrV7aa	maybe homosexuality should be offered to christians as an alternative to keep them active yet maintaining their abstinence?

Whites are stereotypes as being intolerant of others, slavery, colonization, looking down upon others, etc.<br>  <br>  Just the way it is.

Many are stupid and don't understand that everyone in this world can't be exactly the same. They are "stuck" in their complete ignorance and racism that I don't think they even notice. I can't understand how they don't when they don't know anyone but themselves. They are too impressionable. They believe everything they are told. They can't seem to think for themselves. They are mean. They don't care about anything in the world that doesn't effect them. They are racist w/out knowing it (that gets me)...... my list could DEFINITELY go on, and I'm talking out of my a** either, I'm a black girl born and raised around nothing but the whitest of the white people.

There is a huge European sex slave market throughout the world.<br>  <br>  Google it. or whatever....<br>  <br>  I suggest you learn a little more about history AND current events before advertising your ignorance. Learn about the civil rights movement and how blacks were basically enslaved until the 60s; Realize that although your ancestors may have been enslaved too, they are no longer living in that same culture with their oppressors - the Irish in Ireland are still bitter about English oppression. <br>  <br>  You talk about black people still bringing up slavery?

Your questions is offensive alone. Everyone does not hate Carcausion people.. <br>  <br>  I'm Black and Cuban and I will be the first to tell you there are some amazing Carcausion people I've met in my life. So I'm a witness that everyone doesn't hate Whites, but as a minority my history is full of rich, beautiful culture, as well as struggle and injustice..<br>  <br>  I can tell your very young, so I will break this down for you.. There are people who are racist and don't like White people, just like there are some White people who hate Blacks and other minorities..<br>  <br>  No, you or "White" people don't owe anyone anything, however, it's just not about slavely honey.. It goes deeper than that.. African's were taken from their homelands and put into the most unsanitary conditions where many got sick and died. Those people lost their mothers, father, sisters, brothers and everyone that loved dearly. Chained like dogs and sent to a country forgein to them, which was the "New World." <br>  <br>  African's were forced to build this country, whether you want to believe it or not.. They were beaten, starved, murdered, raped.. These people had no way out.. How would you feel if you wanted to learn to read and the daylights was beaten out of you for that reason. These people spent hundreds of years in fear...<br>  <br>  I know you don't want to hear about slavery, but you asked and I'm giving you a solid, truthful answer. <br>  <br>  As time progressed, Blacks also did in baby steps.. Sneaking to learn to read and guess who helped them to learn? The few good White people back then.. Blacks beganed inventing things that you can't live without till this day..(Look it up.)  Even the very first President was a Black man named John Hanson 1781-1782. He served only a year, but it would have been nice to give the recognicition he still deserved.. George Washington was really the 8th President, but because he's White, he get credit for being the first..  Sounds pretty unfair to me.. Do your research.. Read on it..<br>  <br>  But do you think that was fair to not recongize John Hansen, simply because he was a Black man? It hurts when people don't give you credit or treat you with respect when your human with feelings... Thats how the Blacks felt.. They were human with a heart, lungs, brain and emotions.. How dare someone believe otherwise...<br>  <br>  From Jim's Crow until today in 2009 Blacks are being mocked.. Have you seen the recent news, with a cartoon of two White cops shooting at a monkey who is supposed to be President Obama?.. Now, how do you think miniorites are supposed to react. For goodnes sake, we have a BLACK PRESIDENT, yet there (some) White people who can't stand to see Blacks and minorites progress and will do everything in their power to bring them down.. ***Note: Not every White person is like this... <br>  <br>  Whites have brought misery to many countries and continents, from Africa, Asia, Mexico, the Carribean to the Native Americans.. I urge you again to read on it. It's funny how Blacks can't trace what part of Africa their from, nor can't speak the language of their ancestors.. Why? Because slavery stripped these people of it..<br>  <br>  Yes, every culture has been through slavery at one point or another, but does it make it right? People are never going to forget their own history, and by right they don't have to.. Many are not going to let things go why? Remember Gina 6? Not to long ago.. Racsim is still alive and well..<br>  <br>  American soldiers are in the middle east killing innocent people, ruining their city and country.. America is known for making bitter deals with other countries..  and guess who runs America.. Whites.. Think about it..<br>  <br>  I think people would get over slavery if things were better today.. Honey, its hundreds of years of pain.. Pain that is greater than you.. Yes, the "slaverly" thing is played out, but who are you tell someone else their own history is played out?<br>  <br>  Reality is, people will never forget their history and it's still pain behind it all.. The best thing you could ever do, is be sympathetic and not repeat the cruel actions of those in the past..<br>  <br>  I'm not talking against noone, I think every race and culture are beautiful.. But like I stated before, you ask a touchy question and I told you the frank truth.. <br>  <br>  With a Black President now, with time things will heal and get better, because the process had begun Jan. 20th, 2009..|`|OLvNK5FOaa	its because all white people were racist in the past , they were slack to the native people of South Africa, Australia and they brough African people to America so they could be slaves.<br>  White people were really racist and prejeducice<br>  thats why everyone hates them, because they are so narrow-minded.<br>  they stole peoples families away from them, tried to take the 'black' out of them by inter-breeding.<br>  raped the 'blacks'. <br>  research apartheid laws it has to do with South Africa|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Haha good question. <br>  something that most African Americans don't know is that whites bought them from there tribe leaders. I'm not saying that it was justified its just that they are set on blaming whites. I hate it when people say "your people enslaved my people". my usual reply is "hey i didn't do anything" lol. Really whites are becoming oppressed. Look at the list of scholarships available.

As the LDSs and the Jehovah's Witnesses state that both of them were created by God, that gives us two denominations that teach they are brothers. I've heard JWs deny that they do, but how can they escape the logic when they insist Jesus was a created being - created by the same God who created Lucifer? I think they dig themselves even deeper into this hole by going on to say the Jesus did all the creating after God created him. That would make Jesus Lucifer's father!!!<br>  <br>  LDSs have a warped version of the Trinity whilst JWs deny it totally. Only the Trinity doctrine saves people from the heresy of saying Jesus and Lucifer are (or even were) created by the same God and, hence, brothers. Lucifer was created. Jesus never was because he is the eternal Son, just as God is the eternal Father - without beginning.|`|Khw6v2Gcaa	No no no no no no no and NO again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  The trinity consist of three, thus the tri: God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son. NOt four. just three<br>  <br>  The Trinity always was and always will be. They are the Creators.<br>  <br>  Lucifer was the created.<br>  Granted, he was the most glorious of the created, but he got power lusting and turned sinful.<br>  <br>  Never forget this:<br>  God didn't create sin, it was an option that Satan chose.|`|AA11402196	LDS teach many things, but they believe they are eternal beings. One eternal being was Jesus another eternal being was Lucifer. They believe they were brothers.<br>  <br>  As an eternal being, do you really know differently?|`|udUzdU7Raa	Yes. I am actually LDS, so I believe that (spiritually) Jesus, Lucifer, and in fact all of us, are spiritual brothers and sisters. Mortally, however, we obviously aren't. That is why, if you go to a Mormon church, everyone calls eachother brother or sister.<br>  Satan, in the Pre-Earth life, was good like us. However, when God presented the Plan of Salvation (the plan to create the Earth and send us here so that we could be perfected), and said that one would have to die to save us all, Lucifer offered himself. Jesus also offered himself. The only difference was that Lucifer was determined to force everyone to do the right thing. He believed that everyone should be made to be Christian, and follow God. Jesus said that he would offer himself so that anyone who chose to, could be saved. God obviously went with Jesus as this was fair. 1/3 of all of us followed Satan, who was cast out, and from then on called Satan, or the devil. He is always trying to lure away the rest of us. He wants us to be evil and cast out like him. Jesus was chosen and came as the Messiah to allow us to be resurrected. Because of the atonement, repentance from sin is also made possible without the sacrifice of animals.<br>  Also, when you read the Bible, Jesus always refers to God as "Father". Most Christian religions say that we are God's sons and daughters. Therefore, Jesus is our spiritual brother.<br>  <br>  It is an interesting and thought provoking concept.<br>  <br>  One thing you must realize (this is what makes Jesus different from the rest of us) is that Jesus is God's only begotten. Joseph is not his mortal father. The Bible says that the spirit of God impregnated Mary. Hence, unlike everyone else, God is Jesus' spiritual AND mortal Father. Many people cannot come to terms with that idea.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps you out!!!|`|xLKPKgZXaa	The Latter Day Saints have got that wrong. Jesus is the only begotten Son of God. Lucifer (Satan or the devil) was created an angel and dwelt with God but was thrown out for rebelling against God and trying to get one third of the angels of help him to overthrow God.<br>  <br>  He now knows that he can never do that so has spent every moment since then doing what he can to prevent human beings from believing in God. He wants no-one to go and dwell with God and experience what he threw away.|`|HCzA9m3Faa	well,,,,,,no,Jesus created Heaven and earth and everything Visible and Invisible,therefor Jesus would be the father aka creator of Lucy|`|7zbj4jU1aa	That is what they believe yes.<br>  They also used to believe that black were the son of saten, whites the son of jesus, and us brown brothers were the worse cause we didn't make up our minds.

Here is a great verse for you concerning Jesus being God and creator.<br>  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:<br>   I hope this helps you.|`|a7BWdTeJaa	you dont have to think of it in any religeous way. <br>  if you take the half that jesus was one with god then of course the two were not brothers. more like jesus was the father to lucifer.<br>  on the other hand if you take it is they were both created by god then all of us would be brothers and sisters anyway because we were all created by god.<br>  <br>  either way it doesnt really matter, lucifer= rebellious angel cast out of heaven, jesus= prophet, god, son|`|6yiBCu7Eaa	I think this pic shows their true relationship:  <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/d30-14/jesus-and-satan.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/d30-14/jesu...</a>|`|eNarABwNaa	No.  Jesus is the Son of God.  Lucifer/Satan/Devil is just a fallen angel that got to big for his boots.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	According to the LDS Church: Satan, also called the adversary or the devil, is the enemy of all righteousness and of those who seek to follow God. He is a spirit son of God who was once an angel "in authority in the presence of God" (D&C 76:26-27; see also Isaiah 14:12). But in the premortal Council in Heaven, Lucifer, as Satan was then called, rebelled against God. Since that time, he has sought to destroy the children of God on the earth and to make them miserable.<br>  <br>  We believe that every person who has ever lived, now lives and will live are also actual spirit children of God. So yes, Jesus and Lucifer are brothers. And, guess what, so are all of us. Jesus is our elder brother and Lucifer is our brother as well. But, like can happen to families on earth, Lucifer has been disowned.|`|AA10057370	Not in bible.<br>  NO.<br>  <br>  Read and follow bible not LDS.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	@Tabitha Tea. You're lying or being purposely deceitful. Most LDS that have been asked that question have answered that we do believe it. <br>  <br>  Anyway where did Satan come from if God didn't create him or his soul? If God didn't create him, that would put Satan on a co-equal position with God. And unless you're a Satanist, any one who holds a Christian belief knows that Satan is not more powerful than God. So therefor God created Satan. <br>  <br>  God is the father of our spirits. This also includes Satan/ Lucifer. <br>  <br>  I think most anti-Mormon ask this question because they want to elicit shock among people. Is it so horrible to admit that Satan was a spiritual being albeit a rebellious one? And to admit that God calls of us children even the fallen ones? Plus most people think that since Jesus and Lucifer are brothers then they must be equal. Of course any traditional Christian teachings would exhort that that is so far fetched it's not even funny. <br>  <br>  Peace|`|yp8y1jrCaa	Maybe in a spiritual sense. <br>  <br>  Jesus is (in my opinion) 5 spirit influence that guided the man on earth - Jeshoua (spl?). The man was 100% man - the spiritual influence  may have been both genders. <br>  <br>  Lucifer is an anger created from fire, who chose to come to earth to supply man/womankind with light, warmth, cook our food, and regeneration (Example: some seeds need the heat od fire in order to germinate...Spontaneous fires clear underbrush making room for new growth of plants).<br>  <br>  Lucifer is the Light-Giver. An angel created from fire. In my belief, gave man fire for the first time. Supplied us with warmth, light and a way to cook our food. "He" has been known as the "morning star"... and when in comprehension...The morning star rises in the morning and sets in the evening... Our Sun is a star, and is a huge fireball. I cannot prove this, it is merely a thought. The universe is called "uni-verse" for a reason... One body, many parts. <br>  <br>  I do not consider "Him" the same as Satan. They are different entities.<br>  <br>  In my thought, Lucifer came to earth to supply mankind with fire as a choice, not because of "naughtiness". <br>  <br>  If you consider flame, for me it has many analogies of a greater God Force Energy. <br>  <br>  When used carefully, is a source of warmth, romance (candlelit is very romantic), light and a way to cook our food. Some types of seeds need the heat of fire in order to germinate... and spontaeous fires clear overpacked underbrush, allowing room for more plants to grow. <br>  <br>  When in careless hands, can become destructive.<br>  <br>  The way such energy is utilized determines it's course. <br>  <br>  The colors displayed in fire: blue, orange, yellow : <br>  <br>  Blue - truth and creativity<br>  Orange - inner child<br>  yellow - survival<br>  <br>  My theory unproven: Flame may bring forth angelic essences that would coincide with the reason you might be utilizing fire, as in a candle.. <br>  <br>  For celebration - birthday candles - might bring happy spirits. <br>  <br>  If you light a candle for a loved one, may bring spirits that bring forth prayer carriers. <br>  <br>  If you light a candle for healing, may bring forth healing spirits.<br>  <br>  A candlelit dinner may bring forth spirits of romance. <br>  <br>  I do believe the intentions in your heart matter. <br>  <br>  This is not "magiK" to me, I believe "He" is an angel that chose to supply us with caring ... (may be mischevious at times). I believe it is a way that we were meant to work among others in a spiritual life.|`|E870WbAsaa	Brother,<br>  <br>  Jesus (may peace be upon him) was a mighty prophet of God, who did miracles with the permission of God.<br>  <br>  Lucifer or satan is a fallen angel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prays for you :)|`|YUAegpPoaa	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

97sKOWQ0aa	Mother Teresa was always her own person, startlingly independent, obedient, yet challenging some preconceived notions and expectations. Her own life story includes many illustrations of her willingness to listen to and follow her own conscience, even when it seemed to contradict what was expected.<br>  <br>  This strong and independent woman was born Gonxha (Agnes) Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Yugoslavia, on August 27, 1910. Five children were born to Nikola and Dronda Bojaxhiu, yet only three survived. Gonxha was the youngest, with an older sister, Aga, and brother, Lazar. This brother describes the family's early years as "well-off," not the life of peasants reported inaccurately by some. "We lacked for nothing." In fact, the family lived in one of the two houses they owned.<br>  <br>  Nikola was a contractor, working with a partner in a successful construction business. He was also heavily involved in the politics of the day. Lazar tells of his father's rather sudden and shocking death, which may have been due to poisoning because of his political involvement. With this event, life changed overnight as their mother assumed total responsibility for the family, Aga, only 14, Lazar, 9, and Gonxha, 7.<br>  <br>  Though so much of her young life was centered in the Church, Mother Teresa later revealed that until she reached 18, she had never thought of being a nun. During her early years, however, she was fascinated with stories of missionary life and service. She could locate any number of missions on the map, and tell others of the service being given in each place.<br>  <br>  A lot of times when something devestating happens to you.<br>  <br>  You turn to God and want to help people.<br>  <br>  It's an aching feeling in your heart for the poor.<br>  <br>  Great Question Hun.|`|Yr7SEREzaa	Religion is for the weak-minded, whose lives are defined by absurd theories from a corrupt system.<br>  <br>  www.zeitgeist.com<br>  <br>  try this website. it will make you think about big issues in our world.|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	<a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=How+did+having+a+religious+faith+change+Mother+Teresa%27s+life%3F&page=1&qsrc=2417&zoom=&ab=0&u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMother_Teresa" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=How+did+having+...</a><br>  <br>  That's all I can find at the moment<br>  :-)|`|fER8XF68aa	It may have helped her justify being such a monumental hypocrite.

After Keating was convicted of fraud, Turley wrote to Mother T and pointed out that the money which she had received from Keating was, in fact, money that Keating had stolen.

But to come in unannounced, and make an insensitive comment like that so early on, was nothing short of an insult to the dead and suffering.

No public accounts were made available by her 'missionaries of Charity' but enormous sums are known to have been raised.

In one on-the-record interview, Mother Teresa spoke with pride of having opened more than 500 convents in 125 countries, 'not counting India.'

NQ2ctdKyaa	I don't get the question exactly...But I'll just answer to everything i understood.<br>  In the Islam there is a concept of punishment in the grave.It depends upon the deeds of the believer(Muslim).If the Muslim is a good Muslim then he will have a grave which will be wide and open.No trouble will come upon him.BUT If the believer is a bad person then there will be all sorts of punishments for him.e.g His grave will tighten on him such that his bone's will entangle in each other.Scorpion and snakes will bite him all the days and night.<br>  All of this is spiritual by the way.The soul is given the punishment not the physical body.<br>  So if person's body is burned after death.Or if he isn't buried it doesn't matter.He is still dead.His soul will get reward or feel the pain.<br>  As for Jews I have no idea...<br>  And the christian burial is quite similar to the Muslims.Rather its actually the same thing.But one thing differs.In Islam we don't prefer the Coffin.He bury the body straight into the grave.<br>  There are scientific advantages of that.<br>  We know that the body decomposes.And rots.So after about 30-50 years We can wipe out the grave yard.Demolish it and use it for agriculture.There is no Prohibition.|`|0tn43Pywaa	The concept of suffering in the grave was borrowed from the Jews.As they believe that the grave is a suffering.But this torment will just be for a little while just to get you purified.<br>  <br>  The hindus basically believe in reincarnation.If they were good hindus in their earlier life as a reward they will come back as Kshatriya or even as Brahmans depending on how good they have been.<br>  <br>  The Christians do not believe that the grave is a punishment but rather as a place to put your body to rest and when the day of judgment comes they will raise to face judgment and also to note that they believe that after Jesus comes the second time they will have resurrected bodies that will never die.So the concept of Christian burial does not fit with the muslim concept. <br>  <br>  Muslims believe A hadith in Sunaan Tirmidhi (45) says that a grave is a horrible place. It is the first stage in the resurrection process.<br>  <br>  Here is what Allah does to a freshly?dead, buried corpse:<br>  Once people have buried a dead, and start departing, the dead man listens to the sounds of the shoes of his relatives after they have put him in his grave (Sahih Muslim, 40.6863). Sunaan Abu Dawud (2.20.3225) writes that a dead man, when placed in a grave, hears the stepping sound of his departing companions.<br>  <br>  Further, in Sunaan Abu Dawud (3.40.4734) we read that when a man is placed in his grave and his friends leave him, he hears the beat of their sandals; then two angels come and speak to him. Sunaan Tirmidhi (50) writes that upon burial in a grave, a Muslim will rise up, see the setting sun and offer prayer.<br>  Obviously, we should have no doubt about the fate of the unbeliever’s corpse, as he will not offer any Islamic prayer.<br>  <br>  Sahih Muslim (40.6862) writes that after the burial in the grave, and after the mourners have left the burial site, two angels enter the grave and ask the dead person regarding Allah and Muhammad. If he were a non?Muslim he would be shown his seat in hell fire. Once the angels are satisfied that the corpse is that of a Muslim, they expand the grave of the believer to seventy cubits, and he will be shown his place in paradise. Sahih Bukhari (2.23.450, 451) further explains, in connection with verse 14:27, that the dead man sits up in his grave and the angels talk to him about Allah and Muhammad.<br>  <br>  The names of those two angels who interrogate the freshly?buried corpse are Munkar and Nakir. In Sunaan Tirmidhi (44) we get a description of these two angels of graves. This hadis says that Munkar and Nakir, the two angels of grave, have black faces and blue eyes. They will question a Muslim in his grave. When satisfied with the answers regarding Muhammad and Islam, these angels will increase the volume of the Muslim’s grave to 4900 cubic feet, light the grave, and instruct the Muslim to have a peaceful sleep. For a hypocrite his gravesides will be squeezed so much so, that his bones are crushed.<br>  <br>  Each faith has its own concept of burial, except for the Jews and muslims who kind of have the same concept as Mohammad borrowed the concept of grave torment from the Jews of Medina. But the description or the extent that a Jew will suffer is not known.|`|mOWyzwubaa	No Punishment in Grave according to Glorious Quran.None. just nightmares of Jhanum,and nothing else<br>  <br>  36:51 The horn will be blown, whereupon they will rise from the graves rushing towards their Lord.<br>  <br>  36:52 They will say, "Woe to us.

Do not invite them to your wedding. It will mostly likely cause some very awkward and tense moments for some and especially your husband-to-be. This I know.

No one likes "competition", even if the competitors are no longer in the same arena.|`|LcdaUleUaa	ask your fiancee - this should be a mutual decision.  If you're both comfortable with it, then it's fine.  Have a really honest conversation about it.<br>  <br>  Make sure it's clear that there's no penalty if one of you refuses in the end.   You just say "ok, no problem" and move on.|`|Poht8MR9aa	If your questioning it, then the answer must be don't invite them.

SZdVYrSSaa	Indeed. It was warm, and Asian, and throbbing, and about 5 and a half inches long. <br>  <br>  Just kidding.<br>  <br>  I'm not all too sure love is a tangible thing. One can't really hold "music" or "happy" or "rejection" or "hate" in their hands. So how can one honestly grip on to "love" another linguistic symbol which by definition, like the others mentioned, are merely descriptions we use to attempt to convey in language a set of experiences which is different for each individual. We can all hold, or see a rose. But each person has a different idea of love, or experience with love, or lack of love, and they are all so diverse, that the word itself is really a symbol for something that none of us can ever really understand when it is said by another person, as well as we understand it for ourselves.|`|863D1b94aa	Nop....but I was so close to held it in my hands...and that also twice!!<br>  I am dying hard to held love!!<br>  Man...I just love love!!|`|I4JyxwSZaa	Yes!

6eDn9SPpaa	I doubt you have a personality disorder. I understand how you feel, I'm the same way around people. I think I must have some kind of social anxiety problem because I dislike being around other people and I actually get very nervous, stressed, anxious, tense when people are around. I avoid social events at any cost, I've missed college orientation and other school events because I get so nervous being around people. I understand you wanting to get out of the dining hall as fast as possible, I believe you actually felt scared to have someone come sit next to you. I've gone so far as to purposely miss getting off at my bus stop because I didn't want to draw any kind of attention to myself by standing up (and this was when there were only a few other people on the bus). I completely understand your feeling that it's more than just shyness, it's a phobia of some sort..that's what it feels like and I don't know why it feels that way either. Sorry, I'm not able to answer your question or offer any help, I knew my answer would be useless, but I just wanted you to know that you're not alone. Good luck :) x|`|N26qrTd3aa	You know, that honestly does sound like a phobia.. I think its called agoraphobia, or is concidered agoraphobia.. but I'm pretty sure the real meaning of that word is fear of open spaces.. but anyway, your best bet is to see a psychiatrist because yes, they can work on getting over this fear with you.|`|863D1b94aa	Well...answering to your main question..the only way to get rid of shyness is to throw it out of your mind.I can understand what it feels like.,.I used to be the shyest boy in my whole family two-three years ago.But I dared and challenged myself.Yes,I started thinking that there's no one seeing me always,so what's the need to be shy..why be shy???I started with a bit confidence..and now I am boosted with it!!<br>  Dare...man..Dare...go out in more people...so what if they are seeing you???Talk with more people,visit public places alone and get involved in activities with more people!!!<br>  I hope you will get rid of it like me...hope this helps!!|`|AA10092952	I used to be like that. It was really bad. <br>  I would dread doing anything with anyone even though i was lonely.<br>  I would shake and blush constantly. Get sick at my stomach. <br>  Fidget and drop everything. <br>  I was depressed at the time though.<br>  <br>  I got sick of it and went to the doctor. They started me on a light antidepressant called Citalopram and i had no side effects what so ever. But it helped me.<br>  <br>  I started making myself do things and the more i got to know the people the more my shyness would go away. The people i hung out with actually thought me shaking and blushing was cute instead of thinking i was weird like I thought they would. I eventually made friends with this really outgoing girl and her confidence somewhat rubbed off on me.<br>  I still get a little nervous in crowds, and i blush way to easily. <br>  But that sense of dread isn't there anymore.<br>  That medicine gave me the boost i needed to make myself do these things and now that i know the outcome, I Know i don't have to be nervous anymore and i don't need the meds.<br>  <br>  You could be like me. Or you could be nothing like me. =P<br>  A lot of people just simply don't like being around crowds. I mean a Lot of people. <br>  And a lot of people are just naturally timid or shy.<br>  But if you think you might have some sort of personality/anxiety disorder then get it checked out. <br>  It wouldn't hurt anything.<br>  Don't suffer through anything when you can help it. <br>  Good luck sweetie.|`|I4JyxwSZaa	Honestly....stripper pole worked for me! I wanted to be a big slut when I grew up....and I was.  Then I got married...15 years ago...I settled down.|`|Ao52XHjCaa	It's natural, y'know, to be a bit shy of strangers. If we weren't, we would have died out as a species long ago. But I meant to write this the other day when I read your response to Daoie's question on shyness that debilitating shyness and awkward shyness are different things. Your personality is probably just fine. No crime in being an introvert, or socially withdrawn, and you don't scare people away with your personality (or no one would invite you bowling), and you don't show up here as El Chango one day and Tara J the next. But you probably should not be feeling physically ill around crowds of strangers or social situations. If your heart is a poundin' like you're expecting a bomb to go off on a regular basis just because you're in a room with other people- well that might be worth checking out. (emphasize regular basis) Shyness in general can be solved by confidence building exercises, but its always worth checking out things that cause physical pain.|`|Jf9EBze2aa	Hm, it kind of sounds like social anxiety disorder. But I don't want to diagnose you, I'm just a kid. You should talk to a psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  I've got Selective Mutism, (well, the counselor at school thinks so).<br>  If I ever eat in the cafeteria, I always sit at an empty table or at the far end of an extended table where nobody sits. I, too, eat as quickly as possible before people decide to crowd me, (actually, if ONE person sits next to me, it feels like crowding).<br>  <br>  I don't go out much, or at all really, just so I won't have to be around people.<br>  <br>  I tend to blush a lot and I HATE when people point it out, because they take it as if I like someone. It's something like, "Aw,she's blushing."  Very embarrassing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry to go on like that.<br>  But if you can handle it, I think you should go to a psychiatrist.<br>  I'm sure they can help you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|QeWbIQ5qaa	Yes, there is. Just get rid of it. I am Mary Ann from Philippines since birth i am timid, quiet and shy. But as i grow up I realize that being a shy person will not help you to become a mature person. If you want answers from others or advises, you'll need to overcome it. What i've done was before I talk to a person or going to a place i don't look at their eyes. I just look above their heads. Yeah! it is very effective we had a contest at school and I need to join for it is required, what i did i just look at above their heads. I felt like it was only me singing and dancing. Before approaching to a person or going to a place you'll also need to pray or use a sponge. Try to crumple it to control your fear. <br>  <br>  note: never let your fear invade you.|`|ddWK5JRKaa	Joel, my friend, it sounds like you are painfully shy, but I wouldn't assume it's a personality disorder.  Some people get terrible feelings of anxiety around strangers because everyone is a stranger. Once you get to feel more comfortable around them, it should get easier. That is not to say you have to become friends with everyone in the dining hall!  If you eat with friends or your roommate, do you still have the anxiety?  If you are afraid, you could visit the mental health clinic on campus. I think most colleges have one if there is a hospital nearby. I'm pretty sure you have one in the New Brunswick area.  No shame in admitting you need help to get over some difficulty. I wish you the best. If you want to talk about it, you can email me any time, my friend.  <br>  Hugz<br>  ~Rob|`|oY4vwdjVaa	See a psychologist - they have pills for anxiety disorders.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It might kill you before the good effects started coming forth, lol, but I think you need tons of hugs!<br>  <br>  What changed my personality to become more outgoing was a two-step process:<br>  <br>  1.  At college, I fell in with a pretty affectionate group of guys.  This was the first time in my life that I was around people who were physically demonstrative, and I'll admit I was a hug sl*t.  Yes, I was!  My friends accused me of having negative personal space, lol.  But when I knew it was really okay, and really safe, and everyone thought it was cool, I just ate up the hugs.<br>  <br>  2.  This was reinforced at church camp, where the whole message was that we are unconditionally loved.  I got so many hugs in one day I was amazed.  Imagine a big state trooper with a big smile on his face saying, "Lift up your arms" -- and when I did, he gave me a bear hug that lasted three minutes.  I finally gave in and let myself rest in his hug and hold it -- yeah.<br>  <br>  Basically, when you know you are loved and loveable, and there is nothing to be ashamed or frightened of, no judgment, just love -- amazing things happen, because you are free!<br>  <br>  Until you meet a crowd of huggers, though, most universities have excellent counselors at no cost or minimal cost.  Take advantage of that.  Counselors are really nice and cool, and you will feel tremendously better going to one, even if it makes you nervous as hell thinking about it at first.  It gets better -- much better.<br>  <br>  Cyber hug to Joel!  =)

Go ahead and give me a thumbs down, I don't care.  :)<br>  <br>  Edit: $3.33 an hour?  That is hardly high end; were it a high end place, your salary would reflect it.  And if tipping were mandatory, it would be enforced, and you shouldn't be complaining.  If a 15% gratuity were, in fact, figured into the bill, as many places do these days, then there also should be no reason for you to complain.<br>  <br>  If the low wages give you such cause for complaint, especially in singling out and generalizing an entire segment of the population, take the advice of the one answer you liked, and try eating top ramen for meals yourself.  It is much less expensive, and will stretch your salary far.  :)<br>  <br>  Edit 2:  You come on here with a racist posting, and you are saying * I * sound ignorant?

I have a hard time believing that in all of your work experience you have only been tipped poorly by just black people. In fact you are simply making a generalization of all black people due to a few bad seeds. Bad tippers come in all colors. Secondly why should you feel the need to be extra nice to black people in general. We are human just like everyone else and prefer to be treated the same as everyone else. The simple fact that you feel the need the make an extra effort to treat someone with some dignity shows you have a bit of prejudice. Regardless of if you think you are racist or not. Also people tip according to the service they recieve. Perhaps you extra effort is being interpreted as patronizing. And the simple fact that you do not like serving black people is being subconciously expressed towards your customers. We can always tell when we are not welcomed or wanted. Why would someone want to tip someone who looks down on them. Frankly with the recession and your poor attitude you are lucky you get tipped at all. P.S. Alot of restuarants are going out of buisness due to the lack of customers because of the recession. These poor tippers are not only keeping the restaurant you work in, in buisness. But they are also keeping you employed regardless of their skin color.|`|Mo3EXKNraa	I can't believe with all of the filthy, ignorant ranting you post here that you are surprised you get lousy tips.  YES, you ARE RACIST.  The fact that you refuse to recognize it doesn't mean it isn't true.  <br>  <br>  People like you disgust me.<br>  <br>  I read your whole question and details. You are an ignorant racist.|`|dy28ZUsYaa	Because it is one of the very few times that blacks can "get back" and take a little revenge on the white race, whitey, the white waitress. <br>  Here is my tip: give your black customers lousy service, and bring their food last. They will complain anyway, because they are never satisfied. My sister has been a waitress at Red Lobster for 8 years now, and she says the exact same thing.|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	have you ever thought that they dont have that much money??or they didnt like you as their servant?<br>  or hmm people are trying to save their money now since you know the recession...come on now

And of course we have democratic elections for local, country and UK governments. <br>  <br>  And in Wales, we do have separation of Church and State. The Anglican Church in Wales is already disestablished, unlike the Church of England over the border.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	You've hit the nail on the head when saying "The Bible N.T sounds like enough evidence and proof that Jesus is a God?" If Jesus is a god, he cannot be God. That is because the Bible says God is only one God (though it's not a numeric 'one'). This is taken by Jews and Muslims to mean that any god other than the Creator must be a false god. The logic is understandable. The Bible condemns polytheism - the worship of more than one God. This leads Jews and Muslims to reject the New Testament part of the Bible as Christians have it.<br>  <br>  Read your NT again, friend, and check out John 1:1 - Jesus is the Word of God, who was already with God in the beginning, who is God, and who created everything. He is not a second god, but one with the only true God. The Holy Spirit equally created everything and was without origin. All three persons combine to form the one and only true God. Hence, the Word of God had to take on human form and be born as the baby of Bethlehem, whilst the Father and the Holy Spirit did not. This is part of the Trinity doctrine of Christianity. Jews and Muslims reject this explanation because they refuse to accept the NT testimony of, and about Jesus. By the way, eye-witnesses of Jesus and the resurrection wrote about Jesus from within 30 years or so after Jesus was raised - well within living memory!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Jesus was the messenger of God like Abraham(PBUH), like Moses(PBUH) and like Mohammad(PBUH), not the son of God.  God is unique who always was and always will be, neither God is born of anyone nor anyone is born of God but they are all his creations.  <br>  <br>    As for resurrecting dead people, there have been several saints that were able to do that who weren't even Prophets like Jesus.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

A divine savior deity was perfect for the pagans that Paul took the story to, its the EXACT opposite of what the Jewish Messiah will be.<br>  <br>  The Jewish messiah will be human, not divine.  He will actually accomplish the 23 prophecies (not the distorted 300+ Christians have been taught to believe pointed to Jesus).  He will not perform miracles like a street magician.  He will NOT be worshipped.<br>  <br>  the last one is a deal breaker for Jews. They worship G-d and only G-d, not G-d as a trinity, not Jesus and not G-d as human.<br>  <br>  The prophecies that Jesus didn't fulfill in order for him to NOT be the Jewish Moshiach (Messiah) and also note that these had to have been done on ONE visit on this Earth, since our Moshiach is a human:<br>  <br>  * The Sanhedrin will be re-established (Isaiah 1:26)<br>  * Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance. (Isaiah 2:4)<br>  * The whole world will worship the One God of Israel (Isaiah 2:17)<br>  * He will be descended from King David (Isaiah 11:1) via King Solomon (1 Chron. 22:8-10)<br>  * The Moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with "fear of God" (Isaiah 11:2)<br>  *****In other words - this must all be accomplished in a human lifetime*****<br>  * Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)<br>  * Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9)<br>  * He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10)<br>  * All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)<br>  * Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8)<br>  * There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)<br>  * All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)<br>  * The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)<br>  * He will be a messenger of peace (Isaiah 52:7)<br>  * Nations will end up recognizing the wrongs they did to Israel (Isaiah 52:13-53:5)<br>  * The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance (Zechariah 8:23)<br>  * The ruined cities of Israel will be restored (Ezekiel 16:55)<br>  * Weapons of war will be destroyed (Ezekiel 39:9)<br>  * The Temple will be rebuilt (Ezekiel 40) resuming many of the suspended mitzvot<br>  * He will then perfect the entire world to serve God together (Zephaniah 3:9)<br>  * Jews will know the Torah without Study (Jeremiah 31:33)<br>  * He will give you all the desires of your heart (Psalms 37:4)<br>  * He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful (Isaiah 51:3, Amos 9:13-15, Ezekiel 36:29-30, Isaiah 11:6-9).<br>  Thanks to Mark S and Plushy Bear

UzLnEnJCaa	The Bible is the box.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	All the evidence says the bible is simply "faction" a fictional story in a factual setting!!<br>  <br>  The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!

Theists are unable to suspend belief long enough, if at all, to critcally analyze an argument or proposition.<br>  They have the answer (i.e. - God did it) before really understanding the question.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	If you want to have a philosophical discussion with atheists, it's  perfectly acceptable. Such a discussion with a fundie gets you threats of hellfire.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Abstract thought is not welcome in Christianity.<br>  <br>  They might discover the earth revolves around the sun.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	assumptive thinking smart to who?|`|6ZkXL8mRaa	its ur choice. but God expects us to live right.|`|80JBvRdFaa	The box is a comfort zone for the faithful that makes it difficult to critically analyze all viewpoints because the answers are all based on preconceived notions. Speaking as a former Christian I can understand the amount of uncertainty and fear in viewing the world without the help of the biblical beer goggles. But once you put yourself outside the box and let yourself question your beliefs (at least for me) everything starts falling into place.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Who stores their thoughts in boxes to begin with?<br>  I thought a thought,but the thought I thought, was not the thought, I though,t I thought.<br>  Is that what happens when one thinks outside the box?<br>  <br>  Christians do not assume God exist. We know it to be a well known fact!!!|`|TCNDX14Daa	no, in fact you are supposed to have doubts but when your doubts go away based on life experience or a reason to believe, your faith is stronger. Thats why we have problems, god is testing you.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	Yes it is.. believers have to think outside the bos so GOd can continue to lead us to truth and try to save those that are lost.. so yeah, we think outside the box allthe time...we have to to deal with nonbelievers|`|d3A83djHaa	You obviously don't believe in God, so why do you care what the bible says?|`|t2uqotpFaa	only if it leads you to some logical conclusions|`|8qctM0B4aa	im straight, i only think about the box|`|cdFqekzZaa	Seems so,eh?|`|AA10574017	As long as the box stays within the parameters of the Bible the thinking is allowed to go outside the box.

96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	According to the Bible, the women must keep silent in church dear.<br>  I guess they could preach in sign language...|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It largely depends upon the traditions of any given denomination. Besides Deborah, there is also the prophetess Anna, to whom the child Jesus was brought in the Temple at Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  Paul wrote several things that make it appear that he did not approve of women even speaking in church. The isolation of the comments in one of his letters seems very specific on the matter, but when other instructions are considered, it appears to be a matter of authority that starts with God and as each party in the "chain of command" lives in accord with the command and will of God, then those lower in the chain are (somewhat) bound by the righteous authority of those above them.<br>  <br>  The are active women pastors and ministers in a number of denominations, including the Episcopal Church (Anglican Communion). In many churches, women take an active role in teaching classes.|`|AA11466759	Women have been allowed to be ministers, but not priests.<br>  Up to a certain age, even priests were not allowed to preach, however, (probably due to the fact that reading was a scarce talent), only bishops were allowed to explain the Word of God....this goes back to the tradition of keeping the scriptures in a Holy Place, and giving them the consideration that would be due to God.|`|J8uhpecYaa	There is a small percentage of pastors who are women, but women are still unable to become priests.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Women are not allowed to preach, because the Bible says so.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Because God wanted it this way. Woman have a bigger role in this life, the nurturer and teacher of our children. Oh, she preaches alright to the most important group in the world, our children. This is a very big responsibility and now-a-days woman have passed off this responsibility off to anyone but who it should be the MOTHER! They have made the role of housewife and mother seem like a sin in this society.<br>  Usually when the child first utters a word that word is mama. And when a child comes home from play or school, the first words out of a child's mouth is mama. Listen sometime and notice, it's not dad, they call for it is mama. But the NOW org. has made it so these little darlings are confused and mom is no longer home. They are out making the almighty dollar and are too busy to even raise their children, and now we have something called Quality time for the mother to justify her not spending most of her time raising her child. No wonder our children are in such disarray, they are being raised by the day care person, the teachers and the streets where they hang out because mom is not in the home anymore. God bless you|`|0WB5Tru5aa	It's against the bible cuz the bible says so.<br>  <br>  Actually there are female priests here in Finland, but everyone advocating womens' priesthood is simply "selectively interpreting" what's written in the bible. Not that it's anything new to do so..|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Nothing that stops women from doing anything.  Even preaching.  Maria, mother of Jesus, was a priestess ~ educated in the synagogue. How else could Jesus know so much at 12?  His father was a carpenter.<br>  Peace.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	Christianity is not the only religion where women are not allowed to hold higher positions equivalent to preachers. What about Buddhism for one? Judaism? The Hindu faith?<br>  <br>  Sorry to answer your question with just another question.|`|AMkMHOAyaa	WOMAN CAN TEACH BUT WHEN GOD MAD THE EARTH HE MADE MEN FIRST AND I THINK THAT IT WILL BE INNAPROPIATE FOR THE WOMAN BECAUSE ALOT OF GUYS LUST IN THE CHURCH|`|MTi7r9l6aa	No, it's forbidden in Christianity for women to become preachers.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Well, it's against the bible.|`|aOUjMhUmaa	Hey sister, I just want to say, I think it's great that you're concerned about knowing the truth in the Bible. Even if I'm wrong, you need to keep reading and searching the Scriptures.<br>  <br>  These are my thoughts. I mean no offense.<br>  In Judges 4:9, it says:<br>   "Very well," Deborah said, "I will go with you. But because of the way you are going about this, the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman."<br>  So it shows that it wasn't the best thing that Deborah was a judge in Israel.<br>  Men are supposed to be responsible, trustworthy leaders, in the world and in the home. When they are not, women are forced to fill their shoes, but this is not the ideal.<br>  <br>  Women should not be pastors because that places them in spiritual authority over a man, which is not in line with the Bible.<br>  Read this, 1 Tim. 2:12-13, but remember that God values both men and women the same.<br>  <br>  Different roles does not mean different value.<br>  <br>  Also, read Ephesians 5. Why does God tell men to love their wives, and women to respect their husbands?<br>  Because men run the risk of taking their wives for granted, which is the most hurtful to a woman, and women run the risk of bossing around their husband and controlling him, which is most hurtful to a man.<br>  (Neither sex wants someone to take them for granted or boss them around, but if you ask any woman what is worse, they will say being taken for granted or treated like crap, and a man will always think it's worse to be bossed around by his wife).<br>  <br>  Say what you want that this is all culturally learned or whatever, but I'm just trying to answer your question.|`|VQmHIrStaa	We find this in 1 Corinthians chapter 14:<br>  "As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."|`|qGw6FSY8aa	There are quite a few women preachers, on television (example Joyce Meyers) and some in churches. <br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic church does not allow women to preach on the pulpit but many nuns find a way to let their voices be heard loud and clear through the media and just by setting an example in the way they live.|`|Poht8MR9aa	Its in the new testament, but I can't remember where. Basically its man being the father figure. The old testament was the law which with the sacrifice of Jesus was replaced with the new testament and how we are to live.<br>  Women can teach other Women, but they are not to lead "men". Continue to study it.<br>  I know with today's society there are some things that are hard to agree on which is also talked about in the bible about the moral decay that would come.........and we are seeing that now for awhile.<br>  There were a few things I had a hard time with but through prayer and asking for the Lord to reveal his word for me I had a moment of clarity that If I believe what the bible says I can't then go through it and pick and choose what I will and will not believe, so when I come upon something that is difficult for me I often find that some where in there my pride is involved .|`|jc4xttvkaa	According to the bible women shouldn't even speak in church. I dont agree but what ever.  1 Corinthians 14:35<br>  <br>  If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church|`|SyBIuKzdaa	It depend on the religion. Some religions allow a woman to become a minister while others don't. <br>  <br>  But then I'm Unitarian Universalist and they are the only religion with over 50% female ministers.|`|x3OnQn25aa	i think they are allowed to, i've seen some women pastors in churches and women pastors for teenagers.|`|oQzjoPlGaa	Woman are too intelligent.|`|AA12233315	women do preach nowadays|`|6FsZykp1aa	Not in the Catholic Church.|`|d9nVMAuiaa	Instead of preaching, they should be making me sandwiches.|`|dLKTEhnyaa	women don't have a lot of common sense anyway|`|79aZQf4qaa	well if you're in the US there is something called "freedom of speech"|`|FDsopi1Taa	Women are not allowed to preach in church. But I think they can preach outside on the lawn.
WnLLU2Jlaa	Why do people believe there is not God when there is a whole damn universe up above us as if that was just automatically there by itself? **Planets Included***|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	Yeah, you got me on that one.  I for one, am going to get shitfaced now.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Yay!<br>  <br>  *drink*<br>  <br>  EDIT: It's so funny when people don't get the joke.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Sometimes atheist assert that there is no proof that God exists.  The only problem is that an atheist cannot logically make that claim.<br>  <br>  In order to state that there is no proof for God's existence, the atheist would have to know all alleged proofs that exist in order to then state that there is no proof for God's existence.  But, since he cannot know all things, he cannot logically state there is no proof for God's existence.<br>  <br>  At best, an atheist can only state that of all the alleged proofs he has seen thus far, none have worked.  He could even say that he believes there are no proofs for God's existence.  But then, this means that there is the possibility that there is a proof or proofs out there and that he simply has not yet encountered one.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, if there was a proof that truly did prove God's existence, would the atheist be able to accept it given that his presuppositions are in opposition to the existence of God?  In other words, given that the atheist has a presuppositional base that there is no God, in order for him to accept a proof for God's existence, he would have to change his presuppositional base.  This is not easy to do and would involve a major paradigm shift in the belief structure of the atheist.  Therefore, an atheist is presuppositionally hostile to any proofs for God's existence and is less likely to be objective about such attempted proofs.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	In simple terms academia states that in the absence of proof of the existence of something it must be deemed not to exist until verifiable proof is found - thus god is held not to exist pending some sort of verifiable evidence.<br>  <br>  There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!<br>  <br>  There is nothing to suggest the bible is anything other than "Fation"  A fictional stroy in a factual setting!!<br>  <br>  The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!<br>  <br>  Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!<br>  <br>  What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|MgiK02Zbaa	just because a book says theres a loch ness monster would you believe it? same concept.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Thanks.<br>  <br>  *drinks*|`|hHGNE0IRaa	Ok, never mind that question.

YBXKq5Jkaa	I used to until I got married. I was only 18 at the time. Very soon after I was married I opened my eyes and realized that I am no man's slave and men are just as capable in washing the dishes as women are.  The women who still believe they need to serve their men were brought up to believe in this. My mom is just like yours. You can't blame them though. They were probably not exposed to any other way. I would be very frustrated if I were in your position. If you are old enough, maybe it's time to move out. That would probably be easier then trying to change your moms ways.|`|KfM8ApsKaa	I suppose this ideal was acceptable when men worked outside from sunrise until sunset to support the household. But, now when most men (and I used that term loosely for males over the age of 18) work the same amount of time outside the home as most women do, the "under the roof chores" should be shared.  In my opinion, a set of testicles doesn't turn playing Halo for hours into a valid contribution.|`|LCdOocBAaa	No, men SHOULD be doing half the house work. Seriously, don't call yourself a real "man" if you can't even participate in things like that. The wife should not have to do everything around the house, after all, men do usually make the messes lol i should know, I am one!<br>  <br>  My girlfriend and I split all the housework equally.|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	If the men are doing other things that help out, it shouldn't be a problem as long as everyone does something.|`|QsCPOHAraa	I think your mom is comfortable fulfilling the traditional role of wife... and that's fine.

Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  next:<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  The is a God, Allah almighty|`|TyJuZnZhaa	I don't believe God exists.<br>  But I don't believe God doesn't exist either.<br>  <br>  More or less, I find it impossible to get rid of the possibilities.<br>  <br>  There is no solid evidence that proves or disproves God's existence.|`|uJO0MbShaa	I absolutely do not believe there is a Cloud Santa with a long white beard looking down from the sky sending people to hell.

01f0dac47a423ecab2421c4e39d16905aa	Yes.  They are covering their butts.  You don't work in a professional environment you work in a workplace that is driven by fire.  You added fuel and they all jumped on it.  Probably a boss was there and they wanted to look good.  Never be that person.  Always and I mean always let it go.  Walk away knowing that you are influenced by others.  Be professional.  Help the company by helping other succeed not hurting them.  Never hurt a co-worker in public and I am saying in a meeting where it isn't just you and her.  You are really putting yourself out there.  <br>  <br>  Be very careful of these environments many times as a boss I know, that when you talk about each other then you are viewing the workplace in your eyes as you see it.  Be careful of what others are saying.  This is very counterproductive to a company.  Decisions are not "bought in" and others can take a "we" approach to decisions.  The company is blaming others not taking responsibility and making changes.  This is horrible and the climate of a survey will point that out.  There was no way for you to know how your supervisor believed that climate was.  Did your supervisor believe the person was doing a good job.  Was the person doing a good job and didn't get along and making the company money.  You didn't know.  NEVER PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE UNLESS SOMETHING REALLY BAD IS HAPPENING THAT IS COSTING THE COMPANY MONEY.  Never second guess the boss.  But stand up for your beliefs when it counts.  Make sure it's professional.  It is really hard.  Never ever just decide to stick yourself out there in a meeting.  <br>  <br>  Americans are very forgiving and if the other person you are attacking shows any emotion of upset the others will follow with empathy.  Be very careful with that.  Knee jerk reactions with zero backup can stab you in the back.<br>  <br>  Your next steps should've been to apologize.  Then get yourself out of the loop and let others know why.  Your only response is that I want to be very professional and that isn't professional.  Do your job to your best ability and make your company money.  A boss won't forget that.  Remember that we always forget we are American.  So don't think that your public outburst you thought would go so well didn't, but rather you are still the hard working employee you were when you were hired still persists.  Let the others work themselves out.  The bosses will find out the truth.  If you are effective then everything will be OK.|`|BcDXC47haa	Yes.And we need to pull ourselves out of this mess.Bad offices practices bad politics.|`|TGu0LTQTaa	I think there are a lot of politics going on in your company. It is not a healthy environment in a 'dog eat dog meat'. Your superior may or may not support you and may belong to one side. Try to see who he support. It's no point to go against them. Either you follow them (hopefully on you side), you may have a hard them. Stay on, and if you feel pressurised as nobody are at your side you have to look for other job but don't resign as it would be hard to find a job at this recession until you find a new job.|`|mGhzmZC2aa	Yeah, I have been in that situation before. Especially the way things are at the moment, most people are feeling more negative than ever. I've also noticed that making negative comments makes me feel less happy about my job, so it is even more important to stay positive.<br>  What I try to do is avoid joining in with the negative conversations. (If you have a real grievance, that is different, but there are correct and incorrect ways of dealing with these things.)<br>  Secondly, I try to influence the group towards the positive. Walk into the office and say "hey, have you heard the great news?" and share something positive about work. Or try to counteract the negative comments: "that may be, but have you thought about it like this...?" Etc...<br>  Easier said than done I know, but if you practise a positive frame of mind, you will get better. You never know, some of your colleagues' attitudes may change too!<br>  <br>  As for being mean to your coworker, I would take them to one side and apologise for what you said/did. Then leave it at that and make sure it doesn't happen again. :)|`|E6WWBEM2aa	its especially hard for me because i have a supervisor who's good to you not based on your work but if you hang out with her during lunch.....one time i had to go to a doctor appt and when i came back she was like upset.....

BE59y5E2aa	Eli may not be aware of your particular stance on matters of religious and spiritual nature.   Since no one can absolutely be 100 % sure of anything it is purely an individual's opinion.<br>  <br>  None of us will really know for sure, until we get there.  Until then, it is only a feeling and not a fact.  I respect that atheists feel otherwise....<br>  <br>  Me?  I am only a wiccan, and that is how I feel..|`|2iLLZBjyaa	I'm not quite sure how that bet would take place. <br>  <br>  If a gunman is standing in front of me and says "Renounce God or your family dies!"

My God understands that I'm weak and will forgive me.<br>  <br>  If I have a choice between medicine and praying for a cure, we'll take the medicine - but didn't God provide the drugs?  <br>  <br>  If I have a choice between taking a helicopter off of a sinking ship or praying that the ship rights itself, I'll take the helicopter - but didn't God help them find me on the ocean?|`|KDm8kLGpaa	Why are you wasting all your time thinking there is a guy going to save you and bring you to some nice place.

VQmHIrStaa	The Bible supports forced sex slavery. You could try to find someone who follows the Bible and buy a hoe.<br>  <br>  "When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment."   (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)|`|aOUjMhUmaa	Ethan, dude... where did you get that verse?

I ended up losing some friends but they were never really friends to begin with.  My college friends are all cool about it too, so I am happy. The guy I love is awesome and he's of course supportive of me.  <br>  When I told my parents, I said I wanted to talk to them about sometihing. My mum came and hugged me. She asked me if I was getting ready to tell them I was gay. I was shocked because I didn't think it was obvious at all, but they sort of suspected it and wanted to wait until I was ready to tell them. They are cool and so are my brothers and sister.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. So many people on Y/A talk about parents rejecting them or friends, or both.  It's so sad. I would be a supportive friend to anyone who is gay and feeling alone. <br>  I'm glad your friend is cool about it (most of the time) too.

HH90Eghaaa	Yes!<br>  Money, providing benefits that were previously denied to 10% of the population will cost employers and the government more money! Unfortunately the $50-$100 cost of a marriage certificate will not cut it!<br>  <br>  But look at it from another perspective! We have been supporting straight people's marriages and lets not forget multiple marriages since we were born, its time to get ours!|`|FtVRYkI4aa	I think that basically all of the arguments against gay marriage come from religious points of view. I do believe God exists and that God created a man and a woman... but the thing is that some of us, are just attracted to the same gender, and there's nothing we can do to change it. Therefore, eventhough I believe God created everything including men and women, I think God is okay with gay people. I mean, homosexuality does not hurt anyone.<br>  <br>  Also, I do not believe that if they allowed gay couples to get married, that more straight people will turn gay because THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN TURN GAY. They were born straight and there is no way that they can change their orientation. Therefore, that assures that there will be enough straight people reproducing the human species.<br>  <br>  THERE'S NO WAY TO CHANGE ANYBODY'S ORIENTATION WETHER YOU ARE STRAIGHT, GAY, BI, T, etc. YOU WILL STAY STRAIGHT, GAY, BI, T, etc. YOUR LIFE.|`|n55igpCUaa	First answerer is correct... unfortunately he's a douchebag.<br>  <br>  <-- First answerer made Bolt cry ='(<br>  <br>  There's the religious "it's a sin" argument.<br>  There's the "secular lifestyle" argument saying that gays are simply people that enjoy the thrill of rebellion.<br>  And there's the "screw goes in the hole" argument.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Ehm.....well, there are the traditionalist movement, and the 'unable to make a child' movement. <br>  <br>  Oh, and the 'anti-gay-lifestyle' movement.

What a tool!|`|81f426ea1d682a8c468eb0927ea64972aa	Well, Mr Neil, from a scientifically crude point of view the creationism of the male and female races are based upon the fact that the combination of genetic traits can cause an organism that can better adapt to hostile environment (as if Mother Nature is always hospitable). The theory of evolution without the entirety of creationism kind of supports the idea of the separation of genders, being that those who asexually reproduce/clone themselves cannot vary their genetics, therefore are not fully able to actually "pass on adaptive traits to future generations."<br>  So in a crude, summarized, and I suppose ad-libed way, men and women were created, yes for procreation, but so that natural selection can make with the weaker of the species. All sort of biological...<br>  <br>  NOW, for the actual question itself. Most arguments cannot deviate from the religious cage that is publicized now. One argument is that homosexuality can "confuse the raising of children" in that the child would see both hetero and homo relationships. However, I believe as modern society advances and becomes more "corrupt" anyways, the knowledge of sex and orientation becomes more and more common than common sense itself. These children of which the parents want to "protect" would eventually learn of such knowledge. Though the understandable argument that the child might see homosexuality as okay is seen, it should be taught that it isn't a taboo in terms of modern society, not as a religious text mandated by people who were oppressive towards the different: referring to almost all religions. In all sense, religion shouldn't be involved with sexuality at all. Parables and moral values should be taught with these religions. But then again, I am not as devout as certain others.<br>  <br>  I digress though. In reality and realistic logic, there are none. Most arguments against gay marriage based on religion should be dissolved. Like salt...like salt...|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	All comments regarding the origin of adam and eve are considered religious, so any of the people who use reproduction as the reason to be together are off. <br>  If it weren't for religious beliefs there wouldn't be any hindrance to gay couples getting married. Hey some of us are keeping the population down. LOL|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	They argue that the human race is going to die off because everyone will turn gay.

Between them was a yawning gap (the phrase is sometimes left untranslated as a proper name: Ginnungagap), and in this gap a few pieces of ice met a few sparks of fire. The ice melted to form Eiter, which formed the bodies of the hermaphrodite giant Ymir and the cow Aueumbla, whose milk fed Ymir. Aueumbla fed by licking the rime ice, and slowly she uncovered a man's hair. After a day, she had uncovered his face. After another day, she had uncovered him completely: Búri.<br>  <br>  Ymir fathered Thrudgelmir, as well as two humans, one man and one woman. Búri fathered Borr. Borr had three sons, Vili, Ve, and Odin, who killed the giant Ymir. In the vast flood of Ymir's blood, Trúegelmir was also drowned, although not before he had fathered Bergelmir. Bergelmir and his wife hid in a hollow tree trunk and survived. Odin and his brothers used Ymir's body to create the universe : they ground his flesh into dirt, and the maggots that appeared in his flesh became the dwarves that live under the earth. His bones became the mountains, and Odin strew his brains into the sky to create the clouds. The universe comprises nine worlds, of which this earth (Midgard) is central.<br>  <br>  They placed four dwarves: Noreri (North), Sueri (South), Austri (East), and Vestri (West) to hold up Ymir's skull and create the heavens. Then using sparks from Muspelheim, the gods created the sun, moon and stars. As Odin and two others (differing between the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda) walked along the beach, they found two pieces of driftwood. From these, they created the first human beings: Ask and Embla. Ymir's eyebrows were used to create a place where the human race could live in; a place called Midgard.<br>  <br>  The gods regulated the passage of the days and nights, as well as the seasons. Sól is the personified sun, a daughter of Mundilfari, and wife of Glen. Every day, she rides through the sky on her chariot, pulled by two horses named árvakr and Alsvier. Sól is chased during the day by Sk?ll, a wolf that wants to devour her. It is foretold that Sk?ll will eventually catch Sol and eat her during Ragnar?k; however, she will first give birth to a daughter as fair as she. Sól's brother Máni, the personified moon, is chased by Hati Hróevitnisson, another wolf. The earth is protected from the full heat of the sun by the shield Svalinn, which is placed before Sól.|`|oihouY7Naa	Sounds good, give me empirical evidence of this creator..|`|KDm8kLGpaa	Why waste all your time thinking there is a guy going to save you and bring you to some nice place.

Whether I agree with Freud or not is irrelevant as you were asking about Freud, but it's interesting!<br>  <br>  "While he was very up front about his atheism and believed that religion was something to overcome, Freud was aware of the powerful influence of religion on identity. He acknowledged that his Jewish heritage as well as the antisemitism he frequently encountered had shaped his own personality. "My language is German. My culture, my attainments are German. I considered myself German intellectually, until I noticed the growth of anti-Semitic prejudice in Germany and German Austria. Since that time, I prefer to call myself a Jew," he wrote in 1925."<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires." --|`|ttCkz39aaa	If people were ok with life and themselves already it wouldn't matter about god or the bible or life after death,  It is the idea that we think we need to keep alive somehow or some way,<br>     Everything is going to die it is just a part of life,|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	he likened it too a childhood neurosis and a developing society grounded in the basic wish fulfillment of survival instincts .you really should just read Freud .

The church claims that what we think we are is only a temporary vessel in which we progress through the trials of human life. <br>  <br>  Before the fall of man, death of a star simply meant its collapse on itself. The death of vegetation was simply a means to another organisms beginning. In a sense, nothing dies. <br>  <br>  Death, in the religious days, didn't have much significance. One reason being that no one understood it. But as time grew on, our frontal lobes developed and we became self conscious being, yearning to find out where we came from.<br>  <br>  The definition of death today, in a religious sense, pertains only to animals with souls; in short, people. the scientific definition of death is much different. <br>  <br>  Feel free to message me with any additional questions.|`|fjidmhxsaa	God told Adam before Eve was created that he was not to eat of the of the knowledge of good and evil. (Gen. 2:17) Further God warned that in the day he did eat fruit of that tree man would surely die. <br>  <br>  Adam was without sin, but God had given him a will which gave Adam the potential to sin. At first, Adam exercised his will toward God and had fellowship with Him. How long a period of time between Adam and Eve's creation elapsed the Bible does not tell us. The only clue we have is that they did not have children before the Fall, which seems to indicate a short period of probably a few weeks. However, this is speculation. <br>  <br>  Eve was tempted by Satan who took the form of a serpent. (3:1) The serpent is described as being more subtile or clever than any other animal of the field. This probably is why Satan choose to take the form of a snake. Eve, seems not to think it unusual that the serpent could speak to her. Possibly, Adam and Eve could communicate with animals, but again that is pure speculation. <br>  <br>  After Adam sinned, both their eyes were opened and they saw themselves as their had made them to be, naked and ashamed. The had succumbed to temptation, and instead of being elevated to the status of a god, they had been plunged down into the depths of destruction. What a awful realization it must have been. What emptiness and depths of shame they must have felt. <br>  <br>  They immediately sought to cover their nakedness and sewed fig leaves together into an apron. There was no way to hide or undo their sin. The leaves sewn together were a poor and useless substitute for the purity they had before they sinned. Genesis 3:7<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve, having sinned had broken intimate fellowship with God. The effects of sin is always separation from God. This does not mean that God does not love us, but it means God by His nature must be separated from sin. <br>  <br>         The sin that plunged mankind into sin was not murder or some other gross sin, but a simple act of eating the fruit of a prohibited tree. The sin was disobedience. It shows that man was not capable of determining what was good and evil and that man must trust God in the matter. The tree was placed there to define good and evil. On all the earth there was only one source of temptation, that one tree. Adam and Eve, in reality did already know what was right and wrong. It was wrong to eat the fruit of that one tree. That had to exercise trust in God; God said it was forbidden and thus they had to accept that it was. Gensis 3:8-24<br>  <br>  God's judgment on woman was that her sorrow and conception be multiplied. The result of sin was that the length and pain of child birth was increased. Genesis 3:16<br>  <br>  Man's sin brought the judgment of having to toil and have great hardships in making a livelihood. The same word which describes the pain of women in childbirth is used her to describe man's pain in laboring for a living. Genesis 3:17-19<br>  <br>  Man's death was spiritual as well as physical. When he sinned he died spiritually being cut off from the source of life, who is God. In time sin works its way and all men eventually die. Romans 6:23, says, "The wages of sin is death...". Man is given time; time to live experience life and also to seek God and be saved. <br>  <br>          As we close Chapter 3, the record of the Fall of Man, the picture looks bleak. But we have the promise of God, in Genesis 3:15, man had forsaken God, but God had not forsaken man. The Savior was promised and he would come and all that would by faith accept God's provision for atonement would not be taken in the "second" death, that being eternal separation from God in Hell's fires.

9xM1JPjCaa	honestly i'd say money is about a 4.<br>  all my life i have grown up fairly wealthy and had a pretty comfortable life style.  Having money takes away so many worries in life, you never have to worry about paying for college or bills, and money allows you to see the world in amazing ways.  having said that, money is only a perk in life but it is not life.  money doesn't make your parents love you any more or make your friends any more loyal.  money won't keep you warm at night or make you laugh when your bored.  <br>  really when you think about it the worries in your life don't seem that bad when you have loved ones to go to for advice|`|GlHHz1ehaa	I think money would be about an 8 because honestly, who doesn't love money. Yeah, you need to have friends too. Okay, fine. But everyone loves money and it honestly does make you happier because you can buy things you want. Of course you need to put some of it away to save, but you get more things when you have money. You can't get EVERYTHING you want but you can get a lot more with money than without money. Think of what its like to be poor and not have any money, food, home, friends or anything except a cardboard box. I would love to have a ton of money. I sometimes say to my dad that I wish Bill Gates was my father. He takes no offense to that because he replies "So do a lot of other people". Imagine what his children get! I'm sure they're pretty happy.<br>  <br>  It isn't everything, but it's a lot.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	I want enough to pay my bills and go on a vacation once in a while. <br>  I have never been money hungry, maybe that's why my business went  down the toilet. Even if I won the big one, I wouldn't end up spending that much on myself. I am just not that into possessions.|`|d44FBZwZaa	1 my family doesn't have much money but i would just be happier to get by and be able to be with them these rich snobs make me sick to my stomach they have no hearts sure i would like to have it all but at the cost of being like them i don't think so.|`|JYXDj402aa	About 9. because my family is poor and i live in a poor neigherhood. getting money and having a better life is one of my top priorites|`|0pVXLyGhaa	A certain minimum amount is a 10.  <br>  <br>  Like....... $50,000.  <br>  <br>  But above that I don't really care.  And money becomes like a 2.<br>  <br>  I don't mind a middle class lifestyle with no kids.  And I don't want to work a lot of overtime.  If I could be a millionaire and have to work 60 hour weeks, I would pass because I really value my free time.

I don't know.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is not easy. It requires effort constantly.  I see many young people just quit & walk away. They never want to work on anything. They want everything to be handed to them, without working for them. <br>  Everything is always someone elses fault. <br>  Marriage is a commitment. Once for life. People do not want that anymore. They would perfer to find the easy way out!|`|I5PYvCz8aa	People still get married because every idiot thinks he or she is an exception to the grim statistics and the overall fact that marriage and monogamy are social constructs running counter to the natural instincts of nearly all men as well as the majority of women.|`|iDScOWBIaa	it should be fought for. is chilvary dead? revive it. is marriage dying? heal it. pray about these things|`|bW6NpTXdaa	Idiot is a bit harsh of term to describe them.<br>  <br>  Religious, naive, romantics...I could go on.  But why does the divorce rate really concern you?  Why do people date others, knowing that it will mostly likely end in heartache?  I think the "break-up" rate is even higher number than the divorce rate!<br>  <br>  <br>  I do think marriage will eventually be a relic of past.  For one, people in the US are becoming more cynical towards religious institutions and the shift away from them will lesson the pressure from the doctrines of those institutions.  Another factor is that many will see how their own parent's marriages ended in divorce and therefore, will be more cautious to enter into a marriage, if they do at all.|`|INLQHsl7aa	bcoz they get married not to get divorced
a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Although most people would accept a man hitting a woman if it was a case of dire self-defense, we have a double standard.  Our society seems to accept a woman hitting a man but not the other way around.  For example, how many movies can you think of where a woman slaps a man across the face?  How many times do you see a woman getting mad at a man and kicking them or throwing something at them?  Seldom do you ever see this portrayed as being unacceptable and you usually don't see the man defending themselves.  They are shown just standing there and taking it.  How many movies can you name where it is portrayed that a man slapping a woman across the face, kicking her, or throwing something at her with her standing there taking it?  The man is always portrayed very negatively.<br>  <br>  This is the double standard that I see.<br>  <br>  I think that all physical violence is wrong if it is not in self-defense.  However, society seems to disagree with that sometimes.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Men are usually bigger and stronger, so getting into a fist fight with a woman isn't fair.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I'm a fairly big guy (about 6 feet tall & 235 pounds).  I don't think I could ever hit a woman.  If a woman was that mad with me, I'd probably just take all the blows.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because it is not ok if  you don't get along get counselling.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	You're right.|`|Ek3O7SmBaa	You're absolutely correct to an extent. Mutual respond from both parties. <br>  <br>  Honestly, this is a good question because its difficult to answer without sounding too misogynistic. I guess people says its not ok because our society sees women as weaker physically, but this would also depend on the woman, lol.<br>  <br>  I would say if ever you encounter this situation just be on the offensive side and protect yourself, regardless of gender.|`|I5PYvCz8aa	It's bad form.  If a man hits a woman, it had better be self-defense.  If she's little and couldn't hurt him anyway, he's a stud if he can just stand there and take it.  When my parents were getting divorced, my mother lost it one time and wailed on my father for a while.  He didn't lay a hand on her, and I think he did the right thing.  Otherwise, it's okay to block or dodge, unless things really get ugly.|`|0tNCtgzbaa	because men are physically stronger so it's wrong to fight some one who is weaker you can just leave before she beats you up don't let her have that chance to beat you and come back after she calm down you know some people don't realize what they are doing if they are angry.|`|bW6NpTXdaa	I think that is used in the context of a man ABUSING a woman.  <br>  <br>  but I think if woman is attacking a man, then the man should definitely do something.<br>  <br>  A real man can think for himself, and does not rely on oft quoted phrases to make decisions in his life.|`|A9EydXySaa	idk the most my boyfreind has done is pushed me on the bed. and shook me.<br>  lol i laughed.<br>  i had him push me as hard as he could into the bed :D<br>  it was soooo fun !<br>  lol he was like what no!!!<br>  lol|`|4UBC8hBoaa	because men are stronger than women.<br>  <br>  yes....  2 wrongs don't make it right.<br>  <br>  right.|`|4D7cuMZ0aa	hitting in general is wrong|`|TwPF7EzYaa	I honestly think if a man hits his wife, he is insane and disgraceful and same for a woman. For goodness sake we are living in the 21st century. I think we should have other ways of dealing with our problems rather than hitting, abusing and Revenge. <br>  The majority of Men don't do this. Only a very small percentage of men do.. Probably have mental issues or haven't had a very nice past.<br>  <br>  Basically I know a woman who used to be pregnant, however she was abused by her husband without any excuses or reasons. He used to drink do drugs and played big style on a mild personality disorder. <br>  Seriously men like that are just scum, they are cowardly bullies and control freaks. My heart goes out to every fellow victim and I think all these men should be locked up together so they can abuse each other, preferably in a secure prison on a remote island somewhere!!<br>  <br>  "Men should never hit women and women should never hit men."<br>  When did it become cool to give anyone a free pass to do whatever they want with the assurance that they are always in the right?<br>  No one earns or deserves a beat-down, we need to teach ALL of our children coping mechanisms to deal with difficulties in a relationship and to know when it's time to leave before things get out of hand.<br>  <br>  If you really think about it...Why would she hit you and why would you hit her anyway. If there are any problems sit together and solve them before it gets out of control. If you both respect each other, then nothing will happen.<br>  <br>  I don't think we are being against you by turing this statement against you; however we are just giving our opinions and views about your question. Remember that we are all different and we all think differently<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|xDcLGnKgaa	you r right real men and women dont hit eachother. but even if a women does hit u, it still makes you less of a person to hit her back because either way it goes if a relationship turns physical, it should be stopped.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	I agree that women should not hit men either but look at it this way; if a man hits me what chance do I have if I fight back? I'm a small woman, there is no possible way I could win. Very few women could win in a fist fight with a man. So if a man hits me (and this has happened to me before) all I can do is take it and try to get away because if I fight back I will be hurt worse. <br>  <br>  Now reverse that; say I went off and started hitting him (something I would never do) should he beat the heII out of me just because he can? Or should he try to get away from me like I would have to do in the same situation? If he fights back he will hurt me a lot worse than anything I could do to him.<br>  <br>  True some women are psycho and if a guy is in a relationship with one he should end it. Why stay with someone who gets violent on you? The fact is some men don't need a reason to hit a woman. They do it because they want to and they can. Nobody, male or female, should stay with a violent partner.|`|QsCPOHAraa	I think you're right on. Ideally, nobody would hit each other and we'd live in a peaceful world where everybody got along!<br>  <br>  And as much as I would personally hate to have to hit a woman, I believe that there are situations where it would be necessary.<br>  <br>  I recall an episode of Macgyver where a woman had just triggered a nuclear bomb to go off, and a countdown started. Macgyver comes in and she explains that everyone will die in T-minus whatever time. She's standing in front of the controls for the bomb and Macgyver, after taking a moment to realize what he has to do, knocks the woman out and proceeds to disarm the bomb!

And I didn't see a light or a tunnel anywhere but I hadn't moved from where I was so there might have been something to see but I just hadn't looked around before I revived.<br>  <br>  I wasn't scared.

Anoxia causes a narrowing of the visual field, known as "tunnel vision." During a cardiac arrest, bright lights are shined into the patient's eyes to check pupillary reaction; this is a prime indicator of the effectiveness of CPR. <br>  <br>  NDEs described by survivors include material consistent with their religious upbringing. During a time of stress the brain will produce hallucinations, and most of the time the content of the hallucinations will follow preconceived or learned information. <br>  <br>  Sorry to burst your spiritual bubbles. NDEs are not spiritual events; they are merely the physiology of a dying brain. Get over it.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	I was sixteen, swimming at a beach with a friend.

AA11616515	You need to keep this in the context of what Paul by revelation was writing.<br>  This whole chapter is dealing with the worship manifestations’ {tongues interpretation and prophecy}<br>  We are exhorted to prophecy and to speak in tongues. In fact as verse 37 states, these are the commandments of the Lord|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.<br>  <br>  In the proper place, and at the proper time, as Paul explains in his letters, those things are gifts of the Spirit. He tells us to desire spiritual gifts, but things are done in order for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  (Some people try to abuse these things, and create disruption, and tell false things)|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  You must read verse 40 to be clear on what Paul meant.<br>  <br>  In 39, Paul is saying that people should desire to prophesy, and to be willing to accept the gift of speaking in tongues.  In verse 40,  Paul tells us to be sure to do so in an orderly fashion.<br>  <br>  I believe verse 40 refers to the importance of doing any such prophesying within the context of The Church.<br>  <br>  I think it is very unwise to focus on isolated verses outside of the context of an entire letter from Paul, and outside of The Church.   Chapter 14 of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians is very clear about the relative importance of speaking in tongues.   Paul tells us that this gift is less important than many other gifts from God.   This is a True Grace that some people receive,  but if no one is there to interpret,  Paul tells us that we should not reveal to others any prophesy we receive through this gift of Tongues.   The proper interpreter is The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.   <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	Those gifts were done away with when the Disciples died. <br>  <br>  They were given to Jesus Disciples to teach the people of the area at the time and among those gifts was also raising people from the dead. They needed miracles to shock people so they wouild listen.<br>  <br>  But those gifts in me, healings, speaking in tongues were done away with.<br>  <br>  Is the Gift of Tongues Part of True Christianity?<br>  <br>  “I FELT, as I listened to him praying in tongues, as if there were an electrifying charge in the air,” said Bill after he and six others had gathered before the preacher near the church altar. Do such experiences repeat the first-century operation of the holy spirit? Do they identify the religion of the Bible? We can find satisfying answers by carefully examining the Scriptures.<br>  <br>  The Bible record reveals that when any miraculous gift of the spirit was transmitted, at least one of the 12 apostles or the apostle Paul was present. The first of three recorded instances of speaking in tongues occurred among 120 of Jesus’ disciples gathered in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33?C.E. (Acts 2:1-4) Three and a half years later, while a group of uncircumcised Italians were listening to Peter preach, they received the spirit and began “speaking with tongues and magnifying God.” (Acts 10:44-48) And 19 years after Pentecost, about 52?C.E., Paul spoke to a group in Ephesus and laid his hands upon 12 disciples. They too “began speaking with tongues and prophesying.”—Acts 19:6.<br>  <br>  Why the Gift of Tongues?<br>  <br>  Just before he ascended to heaven, Jesus told his followers: “You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and .?.?. to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Notice that he thus gave indication of just how this monumental witness work would be accomplished—with the assistance of the holy spirit.<br>  <br>  Modern communication technology that enables us to send messages earth wide in many languages did not exist back then. The good news had to be spread primarily by word of mouth, and in this the miraculous gift of speaking in foreign tongues would prove very helpful. Such was the case as first-century Christians preached to Jews and proselytes in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33?C.E. Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Cretans, Arabians, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and the district of Asia, as well as sojourners from Rome, heard “the magnificent things of God” in their own language and understood what was said. Three thousand quickly became believers.—Acts 2:5-11,?41.<br>  <br>  An oft-overlooked fact is that speaking in tongues was just one of the nine operations of the holy spirit that the apostle Paul mentioned in his letter to the Christians in Corinth. Although Paul viewed speaking in tongues as a lesser gift, it was valuable to the early congregation in spreading the good news about the heavenly Kingdom of God. It was one of the “gifts” that contributed to the numerical growth and upbuilding of the infant congregation of Christians.—1?Corinthians 12:7-11; 14:24-26.<br>  <br>  The various operations of the holy spirit in the first century, including speaking in tongues, were also a visible evidence that God was no longer using the 1,500-year-old congregation of Israel as his special people. Unquestionably, his approval now rested with the new Christian congregation, established by his only-begotten Son.—Compare Hebrews 2:2-4.<br>  <br>  These manifestations of the spirit were key building blocks in establishing the young Christian congregation and helping it to grow to adulthood. Paul explained that after having served their purpose, these miraculous gifts would cease: “Whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease.”—1?Corinthians 13:8.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Bible is clear that the gift of tongues would cease. But when? Acts 8:18 reveals that the gifts of the spirit were received “through the laying on of the hands of the apostles.” Evidently, then, with the death of the last apostle, the passing on of the gifts of the spirit would stop—including speaking in tongues. Hence, when those who had received these gifts from the apostles also passed off the earthly scene, the miraculous gift would cease. By then the Christian congregation would have had time to become well established and would have spread to many lands.<br>  <br>  “Unknown Tongues” and Their Interpretation<br>  <br>  The present-day resurgence of speaking in tongues has been “regarded by some as the emotional extravagance of unstable exhibitionists, while others regard it as identical with the phenomenon of speaking with tongues of Apostolic times.” In modern-day?church gatherings where speaking in “unknown tongues” occurs, it usually involves an ecstatic outburst of unintelligible sounds. Accordingly, one person confessed: “I use my gift of tongues mostly in private for my own meditation. .?.?. I feel a little embarrassed in front of other people.” Another related: “I hear my own words, I don’t understand them, but I keep feeling my tongue pushed to talk.”<br>  <br>  What information of real value is conveyed by such unknown tongues, and what about an interpretation? Those who claim to interpret this speech have offered different explanations of the same unintelligible utterances. Why different? They explain away such a disparity by saying that “God gave to one person one interpretation of the speech and to another person another interpretation.” One individual acknowledged: “I have noted occasions where the interpretation was not of the accurate type.” D.?A.?Hayes, in his book The Gift of Tongues, referred to an instance where a man refused to interpret the speech of a woman who spoke in an unknown tongue because “the language was the vilest of the vile.” What a contrast that is to the speaking in tongues that existed in the first century and that was actually for building up the congregation!—1?Corinthians 14:4-6, 12,?18.<br>  <br>  Some today do claim to have heard wonderful interpretations, and they may sincerely believe that God uses this gift when he “wishes to give a direct message to the people.” But what message from God do we need today that Jesus Christ and the apostles did not supply for us? Paul, who was himself gifted with holy spirit, said: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for?setting things straight, for disciplining in?righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—2?Timothy 3:16,?17.<br>  <br>  The fact is, the Christian congregation is no longer in its infancy, and thus divine revelations or miraculous gifts of the spirit are no longer needed to confirm its role. The Bible cautions: “Even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond [“at variance with,” The New English Bible] what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed.”—Galatians 1:8.<br>  <br>  Miraculously speaking in tongues is no longer necessary, and there is no Biblical basis for believing that it is part of true Christianity today. Now that the Bible is complete and widely available, we have what we need in the Word of God. It allows us to gain an accurate knowledge of Jehovah and his Son that leads to everlasting life.—John 17:3; Revelation 22:18,?19.<br>  <br>  Even in the first century, the apostle Paul was compelled to write the congregation in Corinth to correct their view of why the gift of tongues was given to early Christians. Seemingly, some had become fascinated with the gift of tongues, and they were acting like little children, spiritually immature. Too much importance was being attached to “tongues.” (1?Corinthians 14:1-39) Paul emphasized that not all Christians in the first century spoke in miraculous tongues. It was not necessary to their salvation. Even back then when it existed, the gift of tongues was secondary to miraculous prophesying. Speaking in tongues was not, and is not, a requirement for Christians to gain everlasting life.—1?Corinthians 12:29,?30; 14:4,?5.<br>  <br>  The Force Behind Unknown Tongues Today<br>  <br>  Some believe that the driving force behind today’s tongue-speakers is charismatic church leaders who prompt members of their flock to acquire this ability. In some cases it is brought on by emotionalism and imbalance. Cyril G.?Williams, in Tongues of the Spirit, says it has become “in many instances a badge of elitism within the group” and gives a person “stature and authority in the sight of the group and also in their own eyes.” The motivation, therefore, could be a desire to belong to the superior unknown-tongue group.<br>  <br>  Then Loyola University president Donald P.?Merrifield noted that “tongues could be a hysterical experience, or, according to some, a diabolical one.” Clergyman Todd H.?Fast said: “Tongues is controversial. The devil has many ways of working at us.” The Bible itself warns that Satan and his demons are able to influence people and control their speech. (Acts 16:17,?18) Jesus acted against a demonic spirit that had moved a man to shout and fall to the floor. (Luke 4:33-35) Paul warned that ‘Satan would transform himself into an angel of light.’ (2?Corinthians 11:14) Those today who seek the gift of tongues that God no longer bestows on his people are really opening themselves to deception by Satan, who, we are warned, would use “every powerful work and lying signs and portents.”—2?Thessalonians 2:9,?10.<br>  <br>  Tongues—And True Christianity<br>  <br>  The first-century Christians who received the gift of speaking in tongues used it to explain the magnificent things of God. Stress was laid on the need to interpret clearly the message conveyed in tongues so that it could be understood by all and result in the edification of many. (1?Corinthians 14:26-33) Paul admonished: “Unless you through t|`|LQsh261waa	Another translation can be Therefore, my brothers,be eager to prophecy,and do not forbid speaking in tongues.

Basically everyone was heaps keen to use their gifts and so their church services turned into chaos with everyone fighting to have a go. They were also trying to rate who's gifts were better. So Paul says whatever you do is cool as long as you are serving people in love. If that means you dont get to use your gift dont worry about it because the point isnt the gift - its the giver of the gift which is God. And the main aim is to tell people about him. So then at the end he says go for it - use your gifts but make sure first of all you are loving people and serving them and not demanding your rights to use your gifts. the message version paraphrases it and says "39-40Three things, then, to sum this up: When you speak forth God's truth, speak your heart out. Don't tell people how they should or shouldn't pray when they're praying in tongues that you don't understand. Be courteous and considerate in everything."|`|Khw6v2Gcaa	I think, but not certain, that it is telling us to eagerly preach the Good Word to others, whether is is your language or not.

This kind of tongues occurs in church, with others around.<br>  <br>  So as I said before, there is a proper order to these things according to Paul.

What is the context the letter is to the Corinthian Church? Paul wrote the church because after he left it they started to adopt pagan practices.  Paul's style was not to come right out and say it, possibly because the chance of losing someone. An example was when he was in athens he told the people "I see you are a religious people, you have statues of all these gods, there's even a spot for an unknown god, well let me tell you about Him". Paul when teaching didn't say not to worship the other gods but saw an opening to introduces the gospel to them. If he came out and said don't worship the other gods the would have turned their backs on him.  So as Paul wrote to the Corinth church he didn't come out and say don't speak in tongues but  its what he said that ties up the speaking in tongues issue, a kind of punchline.<br>     14:19  "  Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."<br>  And the word tongues in chapter 14 is from the word glossa, which means the languages of man not an unknown spiritual language.

AA10254694	Draw stuff on his face with a sharpie.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	As long as he is on his side he probably won't choke to death on his own vomit.  Go to sleep...but first, make sure you get plenty of photos of him in a drunken stupor.  Put some eye make-up on him or something. Then distribute the photos to EVERYONE you both know.|`|5aKUV5afaa	I've been to College.  I'd just get a blanket and pillow and sleep close to him.  Check on him every couple of hours or so.  You can sleep, but you have to wake yourself up to check on him.|`|89b7405201feaf6d3fdb7bfe0c1d09a9aa	I would probably stay up a little bit longer just to make sure he doesnt role over on his back.  My friend I knew growing up passed away a little over a year ago from choking on his throwup when he was drunk.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	you're not ready for big boy school if you are going to wanna babysit|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	I would stay up for another hour or so (if you can!) just to make sure that he isn't being sick as often. If you don't think you can stay awake, see if a friend can watch him for a while. <br>  If he stops being sick within the next hour, then you should be ok to go. Just leave a glass of water and something starchy for him to eat on his bedside table - oh, and make sure he's got a clear path to the bathroom (leave the door open lol).<br>  <br>  Hope he's okay soon!<br>  <br>  Riley.|`|97sKOWQ0aa	Just keep an eye on him.<br>  <br>  Make sure he is breathing.<br>  <br>  Get a wet luke warm wash rag and wipe his face.<br>  <br>  Never ever take a Tylenol when you drink.<br>  <br>  Or when there is Alcohol in your system<br>  <br>  If you have get your stomach pumped.<br>  <br>  It can damage your liver OK Dude.<br>  <br>  Henley Listen: Talk to Him .Try to wake him up before you go to sleep OK.|`|lKpHd1yOaa	check his skin color, blueish is bad.

KvmjaU86aa	He sounds like an arrogant, ignorant, rude, egotistical, ares hole. You're lucky we live in a more modern world that accepts different lifstyles because he sounds like the type of people that would put you on a stake and light the fire after accusing you of withcraft or blasphemy. I feel sorry for his girlfriend. You on the otherhand has no reason to associate with him so why torture yourself. From my understanding he seems to like the reaction he's getting from you and that's why he won't stop. Hell, you even post this on the internet. Stop trying to prove your point because he won't accept anything you'll say. Leave him alone and ignore him. Why does it matter what he thinks if he is of no importance in your life. Why would you allow someone like that in your house? Are you a glutton for drama? Leave it alone and leave him alone and move on.|`|p4A3EIHnaa	Dude can you stop bashing religion like that? Some of us actually have faith in religion and I totally think that you shouldn't react to someones opinions so negatively.

Right now, your ******* contaminating it by bitching about something you don't have. Are you seriously this bothered by this guy? Can't you ignore him?

If you ask me, bashing Christians the way you did makes you look like even more of an idiot then your "friend." Your so upset about him putting your beliefs down but yet you go an make yourself look like  fool and do exactly what he does to you but you are actually saying it to the whole freakin world. I am Catholic but I don't expect the whole world to believe in what I believe in. I do have friends that are other religions and it's actually interesting to learn about other religions or beliefs.  <br>  I really don't know what your question is. It is very unclear what you are actually wanting to hear from people and sorry but that was just way too long.You need to take another look at the guidelines for yahoo answers.|`|bYU77eteaa	Well, I disagree with you about the religious part. I'm Christian and I have full faith.  But your guy friend is still a jerk...he probably knows nothing about his own religion and is putting you down and calling you names...being nasty towards you and what not. <br>  Only God can judge...Christian or not, we are not to judge each other. <br>  He's not living the Christian way, and the Devil is using him to portray Christianity as a bunch of hypocritical loony bins...<br>  Stop hanging with him and just live your life to the best of your abilities|`|0pVXLyGhaa	You choose who you bring into your life besides family.<br>  <br>  Just don't hang out with this very bull-headed person anymore.<br>  <br>  And I like Edgar Cayce, too.

DYUfnPzhaa	I'm straight and one of my best friends came out to me two years ago.  It was a big shock too- but I think the most supportive thing to do is to try to remember that she really is the same person that you loved before!  Like you said, she knows that you're straight- so I'm sure she'll respect your boundaries.  *And sure-- at first I wondered, "Is she attracted to me?  If I act silly like this might she mistake it for flirting??!"  But things always get evened out quickly.*<br>  <br>  I'll bet she was even more freaked out about telling you then you were freaked out when you heard the news.  If you don't feel comfortable with her talking about girls- you could let her know that you're not quite sure how to respond or act.  My guess is that she'll just want you to act the same way you guys have always been.  That's what she needs right now.<br>  <br>  You're great for being such a good friend to her and loving her for who she is.|`|bbWzitisaa	don't let anything change between you. she should respect you enough not to try anything, so don't worry too much about it. she may have a crush on you, but most likely will not act on that. she would not want to lose your friendship. be honored she was able to tell you, it can be very difficult for people to come out. just support her as much as you can, i am sure she would appreciate it.|`|sSMegQBFaa	If she hasn't come on to you before she's not going to come on to you now. She's clearly been gay all along. The only thing different now is that you know. Sexual orientation does't define who you are or change you, it's apart of you, just like your hair color or eye color.

States include Texas, Arkansas, Maryland.  The link is provided in the sources.<br>  <br>  2nd Edit Add: I've added another link and it has to do with the definition of a "Christian" -- there is probably no better example of religious discrimination than that which occurs within religion itself.

BTpNkxoeaa	It doesn't sound like you're a tranny-chaser because you do have some discomfort with her male parts.  You just have to ask yourself if it's something you can deal with, especially if you feel that you love her.  Another aspect to consider is whether or not she intends to have SRS.  Take the time and figure out if she's a person you want in life and can deal with the fact that she's transsexual.|`|ZzWQHOWWaa	You can still consider yourself straight, because she is a woman, regardless of the body she was born into.

ApG0DpzXaa	I'm not Christian.<br>  <br>  Start with the idea that God represents good, and that God wants his creations to do the right thing and be a moral person.<br>  <br>  Second idea, There are major underlying very important ways to do the right thing and be a moral person, and there are less important things to do that are right.<br>  <br>  Babies need to be taken care of and raised with the knowledge and skills to survive, communicate, and raise up their own babies.  This is a major underlying right thing to do.  God wants this.<br>  <br>  All cultures and all religions have rules to make sure that this happens.  Nearly all cultures have a concept of marriage to make this happen.  Most religions have rules like the 10 commandments saying it is wrong to kill except in self defense, it is wrong to steal, etc.. to help build safe stable families and communities that care for each other.<br>  <br>  They are all God's children and they are all following the basic requirement of God to be good people and do the right thing.<br>  <br>  Then there are the less important differences in religion and culture.  I don't believe God cares if the pope's ring is kissed or not.  I don't believe it matters to God if a Jew eats a cheeseburger.  I certainly don't think God cares if a Muslim woman has on a headscarf or not.<br>  These are differences made by man, not by God.  It's also possible that these differences are the work of evil, because the crusaders sent to the "holy land" (middle east) by Popes 700 to 1000 years ago literally murdered thousands of babies in muslim cities and wrote letters to the pope and had paintings made of themselves praying in the middle of piles of dead women and dead babies impaled on spears and they called this abomination "Holy Work".  Nowadays Wahab Muslims throw acid in the faces of girls in Afganistan who dare to go to school.  These evil men state they are carrying out "God's will".<br>  <br>  Separate out what is important to be a good person, like the golden rule "Do unto others as you would have done to you", and realize that that is the engine of Catholicism, and that rituals and no fish on Friday and other little things are ways to participate in the community God placed you in, but they don't make you good or bad.|`|WnLLU2Jlaa	lol.<br>  God doesn't make a "baby" bad, You make yourself 'bad'. Yes there are different religions, but God didn't make these different religions, we did, us humans did, not God.<br>  And again, he doesn't make people follow other religions, you decide that, its your free will.|`|00287c9623705b5d430277da928b2c67aa	God never invented religion. It was the religious crowd that cried out for Christ to be crucified. God wants a personal relationship through forgiveness of sins through his son. Keeping the sacraments, has nothing to do with Jesus. What Jesus did on the cross is enough for your salvation. He is the Lamb of God, who has power alone to cleanse and forgive you, Not a church. Hope this helps my friend. God can lead anyone to truth from anywhere.|`|LqyOHY37aa	Because god is not real.<br>  <br>  BTW, you made sense until you said, "I'm sorry if that didnt make sence!"<br>  <br>  Spell check is there for a reason.

Only the Christian religions think we're all supposed to go to Christian churches. Don't you think they might be a little biased?|`|fuPqQPvtaa	It is a legitimate objection.

How about studying it.|`|6yiBCu7Eaa	most of the world isn't Christian.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	God gives everyone free will to choose to have faith in Him or not. All humans are born sinners.  God gives them the choice to accept Jesus Christ as their savior and those sins are absolved, or they don't have to.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	You make a lot of sense, and you ask good questions.<br>  <br>  The reason why God allows some people to be born even though they will turn out bad is because of this:<br>  <br>  Romans 9<br>  22 What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? 23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— 24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?<br>  <br>  He means to show how His grace works with His children; as if God loves the drama where His children show themselves in distress that they remain loyal to Him. That would mean that God didn't want everybody. Because He makes some people for the purposes of making His saints work hard. And we do have to work hard at times.<br>  <br>  Do you notice that the world doesn't like to hear about Jesus? That is what I am talking about. They don't like the Gospel message, yet it is our duty to get it out so that the lost who are chosen by God can hear the Gospel and come to Him.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	It made sense.<br>  <br>  The classic reason to explain this is free will.<br>  <br>  Your God let's human beings make their own choices.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make sense to a lot of people, Christians and non-Christians alike, how your God would create people knowing full well that they were going to hell. Most serious Christian theologians have wrestled with this question for centuries without coming up with a good reason why it is so.<br>  <br>  Edit: Most likely, that kid won't follow Christianity. How many kids born to Muslim families, or kids born to Hindu families, end up as Christians? Statistically, not many at all. Religion has a very strong cultural bias; if you had been born in Saudi <br>  Arabia, odds are you'd be a Muslim today.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Yea, I don't believe that you have to go to a certain church to be "saved". I don't even really believe in heaven.

Even if you study the development of religion in history it becomes evident how contrived it all really is.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	There are so many things in the  world that we consider bad but is actually good when viewed in God's perspective of eternity.  The bad people and events in our lifetime are there for a purpose and it fits into God's design of the world and everything in it.|`|GoRFRY2naa	Simple, Because there is no god.  Evolution produces all kinds of people, and not all people are exposed to the preposterous dogma of Christianity, so not everyone has to fight to think for themselves and struggle to realize that they are indeed good people without such teachings.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	not everyone in this world will serve the true GOD... God talks about this in the bible. that is why he made a place for those that dont believe. all ppl on the earth that will ever be born now , past, present and future  were spoke into existence b4 the world was  even framed. this is also scripture. with that said, all ppl regardless of GOD knowing how their life will end up, will be born, in fact they must be born! God does not make us robots, so we are not made to only follow him, he gave us freewill to pick the religion we want to believe in and sadly some ppl pick other gods to serve instead of believeing the TRUTH! a kid born in any other religion will have heard of JESUS enuff to make an informed decision of whether or not they will choose that as their religion. in the bible it says all man, woman, boy and girl will indeed know of him b4 they leave this earth, and that can be supported by scripture as well!!!!!!!|`|SOlh57iKaa	God doesn't force people to do things, he created us and endowed us with the ability to choose for ourselves, the term is "Free Moral Agents."

Likely not, since building a house requires a huge investment of money and can take months or years. You build a house so that you or someone else can live in it. The same logic can be applied to Jehovah. He did not go to all the trouble of creating the earth and the living things upon it without having a reason, a purpose.<br>  <br>  Wise King Solomon said: “Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.”—Ecclesiastes 12:13; John 17:3.<br>  <br>  <br>  So God created us to worship him. to take care of the earth and to enjoy life.<br>  <br>   “God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection .?.?. every living creature that is moving upon the earth.’”—Genesis 1:27,?28.|`|apnOVubMaa	I don't know how much reading of the Bible you do. This could be a big answer to your question. When we pray we are talking to God and asking him for needs we need etc. When we read the bible then God is talking to us and explaining life' s purpose and telling us. how to live. He explains it very well.    Reading the Bible is a life time commitment and it does not happen over night. If your are really a christian then you will want to know all there is to know about the character of Christ and His way of communicating to His children. You will go through  Gods trials and its a learning experience. Do you want this? Are you teachable? Well here is the whole meaning of life and its found in ecclesiastes 12:13   "now all of this has been heard;here is the conclusion of the matter; Fear God[which means have repect toward Him] and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man. His commandments are the 10 commandments and He want us to follow all of them. If you can follow His instructions with obedience    and in love you will find your answers.p.s. don't rely on feelings  for any of life answers This is one of Satan' truths tricks.

I think you should continue to think about it and come up with specific questions in your mind - maybe write them down, and then ask your faith leader to answer them directly from the Bible.  If he/she cannot do this, then maybe it's time to leave your church.  The fact is that the Bible does give specific answers to questions like 'what is my purpose in life'.  Example:  very last verses of Ecclesiastes say that to obey God's commandments is the whole obligation of man.  But the Bible goes into a lot more about what God has planned for righteous mankind and the earth in the near future.  Please visit this website www.watchtower.org

fjsczTsMaa	I feel sorry for you, I know that the kind of behavior that you have experienced is very hurtful. Unfortunately, people all over the world like to stereotype, and people everywhere would rather take offense than see the good in a situation or population. <br>  <br>  I don't honestly believe that the reason people dislike Americans has got anything to do with the war in Iraq, as anyone with half a brain would realise that the American population (the third largest of any nation in the world) has any control over what their leaders do.<br>  <br>  The truth is, that although there are very many ingratiating qualities about Americans in general, they do come accross as quite arrogant generally speaking. I don't know whether they actually are, or it is just the way that they communicate. It is probably quite hard for you to understand being American yourself, but when many Americans come to another country they seem to almost expect a side show act from the locals, and treat them almost as a novelty in their own country. It almost seems as if American people see themselves as the default norm, and everyone else as 'different'. People often take offence to that type of behaviour.<br>  <br>  Anyway not to worry, please just ignore those foolish people they are just bigots, you are better off not knowing them anyway.|`|KgPPFo1zaa	I dont hate americans but a lot of your pple are ignorant and its ******* annoying no offense|`|TwPF7EzYaa	I'm from Australia and I honestly don't hate Americans..just easy as that|`|N8UKu0WUaa	it's simply arrogance, stupidity, and most of all, ignorance.<br>  <br>  the ignorance is proven by the fact that you had to ask this. and secondly, as is always done, you're using your recently former government as a scapegoat. let me say this now, and remember it. people do NOT hate americans because of their government!!! they hate americans because the VAST MAJORITY of american PEOPLE are ignorant, stupid, and arrogant. this can be seen ALL the time.<br>  <br>  America has one of the poorest education rates in the western world. im confident in saying that an Estonian student is twice as intelligent as an average american student.<br>  <br>  American culture is really quite sickening. i mean, look at the jonas brothers, and miley cyrus, and all those other pathetic teen idols-- and Britney spears and the rest of them. How pathetic and mindless does a society have to be to even care, never mind obsess over these people.<br>  <br>  americans are arrogant. they think they're the best in the world. when in reality, they're just a massive cockroach, spreading americanism throughout the world. america's hay day ended a long time ago, but no one seems to realize that.<br>  <br>  just take inventions for example. think the answer to yourself. who invented the light bulb? the car? wireless technology? electricity? none were americans, even though im sure you think they were. the lightbulb was invented by two Canadians, the car was German, wireless Tech. was a Serbian, and electricity was an Italian.<br>  <br>  i could go on, and on for long time.just realize that americans are arrogant, ignorant, and generally stupid/uneducated. THIS is why they are hated around the world, it has nothing to do with the W.

It's certainly not that you're a racist culture, you're far more tolerant than european cultures. But until you actually travel and discover europe, with an open mind, you won't really see how others view americans as arrogant and stubborn in their thinking as a whole culture. The one thing I always say to others that I talk to who aren't american, is that I find american's to be inarticulate and ignorant.<br>  Generalising is never a good thing but sometimes you're forced to.<br>  You're standard of education is lower than most of the progressive countries in europe so you're up against it from the get go. You're use of the english language is very very different too, I argue this with my wife ALL the time. So bear in mind, you may speak english, but your use of it is very very different. And also bear in mind, that the damage your government has done, worldwide, spans far wider than George W's reign. What's happened in the last 50 years is and always will be a huge deal for the rest of the world. From Vietnam to Cambodia, from Korea to Nicaragua, the list goes on and on. Read some Noam Chomsky and forget that the US has any bearing on the rest of the world politically or culturally anymore.<br>  And most of all, don't take anything to heart, personally. <br>  Google Oscar Wilde and see what he has to say about taking things personally. I love america, and I hate america. I'm Irish, and I hate Ireland, but I love it too. <br>  Nothing in life is clear.|`|qWu5F1O2aa	Honestly, i have to agree with Riley. Not so long ago, a very close mexican friend who travels often back and forth from Mexico to the US, opened up my eyes and showed me news we dont get in our media.  Before when i heard foreigners speak negatively about the U.S., I would think people were just jealous bc our army is one of the strongest (economically we're not doing so good though). Unfortunately, the government controls a lot of the media and that's why more than half of us americans dont even know what's going on. Basing it on the american news i saw, we were making progress in helping Iraq and cracking down on "the bad guys". Pardon our ignorance but clearly, the fact that SOME americans still decide to watch the news, says we try to stay informed, it's just our media and government dont relay the truth to us.|`|62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	I'm Australian, I'll be honest with you, for the last eight years everyday on television outside the USA. We all have been watching the genocide and torture of innocent Iraqi people. <br>  <br>  Being this was never shown on US television. You guy's would have no idea of the large worldwide global protests against the United States and George Bush to stop this illegal war.<br>  <br>  When you see bullet riddled young children in a pool of blood with a toy car or doll in their hand or see the blown up bodies or school children murdered in their class at school. Or innocent people like yourself going to work or about their business. Bullet riddled and murdered every night on the news, and seeing, hearing or reading countless news stories just like this day after day for eight years on TV. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJnbUJI7XyM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJnbUJI7X...</a><br>  <br>  Being human, it really affects you deeply, especially when a bragging smart mouthed arrogant Yank with no idea of the genocide and illegal  torture of over a million innocent people. Who never seen brains of a young child spilling out of their head clutching a doll. Or second grade kids bodies wallpapering the walls in their class rooms.  Starts mouthing off about nukes, bombing and blowing up innocent people and turning a Sovereign country into glass. <br>  <br>  This anger over eight years has increased and has made the world to dislike Americans. Even though Americans have voted a new non warmongering President the eight years of anger is still remains in many people.  <br>  <br>  People globally want to see Bush, Cheney, Tennet and Rice face the world courts for genocide, illegal torture and war crimes against the people or Iraq. <br>  <br>  There are only very few of us who understand that none of you guy's seen this devastation on TV to fully understand this deeply embedded anger towards Americans.<br>  <br>  I hope this explains a lot of your questions why many foreign people globally dislike Americans.
AA12059450	You seem to be mistaken... It is quite likely from his apparent education that Luke knew not only the shape, but the size of the planet...<br>  <br>  Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician writing probably at least 250 years before Luke, calculated the equatorial circumference of the earth to within a couple percent accuracy. Several clues in Luke's writing indicate that he was widely read in the ancient historians, philosophers, and scientists, so the odds would favor such exposure. (The work of Eratosthenes was very highly regarded at the time and was considered authoritative and accurate for hundreds of years.) To have an equatorial circumference, earth HAD TO BE understood as approximately spherical. Eratosthenes had calculated the tilt of the earth's axis to its orbit (which defines the "Tropics" and gives us our seasons) and calculated the distance from the earth to the sun, so he clearly understood things modern man rarely gives the ancients credit for knowing.<br>  <br>  Eratosthenes' work remains an incredible piece of logic and mathematics dating from a time when modern man thinks these things were not well understood. Lots of university mathematics professors like to use it as an example and sometimes assign its recreation... NOT an easy task, I assure you... Given the angle of the sun from vertical at "high noon" on the summer solstice at a point roughly 500 miles north of the Tropic of Cancer, find the circumference of the earth... That is basically what he did.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the claims about ancients thinking the earth was flat... Looking from ANY place on the planet with an elevation more than a few feet above the terrain and a clear view of the horizon will make it fairly clear that the earth is NOT flat. (You quickly notice as you climb higher that you can see further, beyond what had been the visual horizon at a lower altitude.) From the same point, sun rise or set will show the curve of the "terminator" shadow, again an indication of a curved surface... It DID take the catholic church to declare the earth was flat a few hundred years later. <br>  <br>  <br>  Luke's apparent classical education virtually assures us that he was aware of this widely accepted work. The fact that other ancient mathematicians commented on the work and repeated it makes this even more likely.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	They also didn't know about the Americas, Asia, England, Australia.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Daniel 12:4<br>  But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end.

I TOLD THEM<br>  <br>  My parents aren't together so I had to do it twice. And it was so awkward. But I realized that I was mad at them and they didn't even know why. And that wasn't fair. At first I awkwardly brought it up, while we were having conversation that it "fit" in to. Then it turned out they had their own things to say to me that they couldn't figure out how to bring up either.<br>  <br>  Sometimes family discussions really go far. We were able to settle a lot of underlying issues.<br>  <br>  And if that isn't an option. You know who you are, and what you want. Work towards that and ignore everything that annoys you. As hard as it is, it needs to be done. If you pay attention to their ignorance, it will take over your thoughts. Just focus on who you want to be, and sooner or later, you'll be able to live on your own.<br>  <br>   And according to older relatives who have just recently moved out, living without their immediate family made them realize how much they really loved them.

You brother will eventually grow up and get a brain; your mother will soon realise you are a individual and you will get to a stage where you know you are above being embarrassed, put down, etc.  It's easy for others to say, but maybe you need to just tell your brother to grow up and your mother to lay off.|`|TGu0LTQTaa	Your brother may be over protective or joking. Let him know how you feel of his actions and tell your mun/dad if you can't resolve. Leaving the family is not the solution.

uuQrhnJ4aa	perhaps a rephrasing to "why do some women not like...?"<br>  <br>  I like good guys. absolutely won't date the 'bad boy'. There's always frustration involved.<br>  <br>  There are some situations where it appears good guys are left behind, but many women are looking for these guys & holding out for them. Some seek 'thrills' of the bad boy, but know he isn't good life partner material.<br>  <br>  Looks initially attract a person, but personality gets them interested & keeps them around.<br>  <br>  I've dated plenty of blonds..as have my friends. The saying 'tall, dark, & handsome' is simply a saying...not every woman wants that. From a scientific standpoint, there are more dark-haired guys than blonds..so there are simply more from which to choose. I don't place much importance on hair color. It changes w/age & can be changed instantly w/a bottle...<br>  <br>  The appeal of the 'type' you reference is for the adventure factor. Many blond, nice guys can be quite adventurous...|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	what? who cares about hair color if hes hot then any girl will like him.. maybe you just have a sucky personality and your looks are not adding any brownie points to your sucky personality.. im just guessing here.. i mean i could be wrong.. maybe its just the vibes your giving off.. i think its dumb to group a whole people into this box and assume every blonde guy is lonely waiting for some girl to like him.. or some good guy is waiting on some girl to ask him out.. good guys will always have long lasting relationships, when the RIGHT girl comes along they will be happy.  Its all about putting yourself out there and testing the waters.|`|pfke6Jieaa	u r wrong. there are a lot of girls who like blond. i agree with the girl above me if ur good looking then ur good looking, ur hair color doesnt matter. what matters the most is the personality. if ur crappy as hell then no girl is gonna like u, no matter how good looking u r. unless she is stupid as hell.|`|tusCN8zpaa	I know a few hot blonds.

92373c108e6ba225edeef58fe8d9e131aa	there is a problem which is within your question itself. Using God as a solution to the problem nothing exists out of nothingness does not solve your questions dilemma either because thiests generally believe God has always existed. By that assertion alone you logically break the nothing exists from nothingness principle because God had to come after something as well. The Bible and other texts fail to explain that principle. What came before God? What makes God good or bad? How did God who came out of nothing in the Bible create everything including light?<br>  <br>  God is not a solution to your question. He is merely a stopgap people use to keep from having to answer your question about how can nothing come from nothingness.<br>  <br>  I am an atheist because using God as an answer is not something humanity needs to do any more. We now understand enough of our world through physics, biology, and other subjects to understand and answer why things are the way they are. Certainly abiogenesis and the big bangs answers have eluded us thus far, but we will answer them eventually. It is my faith in reason and knowledge's progression that causes me to reject the emotional and illogical answers to life's mysteries through faith.|`|5Vh51eazaa	ok i am atheist because i do not see any proof of god. a misconception that is often made buy religious people is that it is on our shoulders ( meaning atheists) to tell you why we don't think there is a god. if i told you that i thought that there was a tea cup in orbit around the sun would you believe me ? i would surly hope not. but it would not be up to you to tell me why you don't believe would it? again i don't think so. it would be up to me to tell you why i do think there is one. so it is up to you to prove that god is there not up to me to tell you why i don't think he is.<br>  <br>  <br>  and as for the hole PROVE that nothing exists from nothing how about you prove that god is there ? the grate thing about being atheist is that we don't have to have all the answers witch religious people do. we openly admit that there is much we don't know. but religious people say they have all the answers in some old book that only the fictitious god would know who wrote.|`|jUXzm8u9aa	I never became atheist, I was born atheist.

I have a girlfriend too, but I really want to be with a guy at times...anyway enough about me. You don't know if they're gay most of the time apart from really small things, and sometimes the only way you can know is to ask them. Try and make friends, and if they want to be friends, then there's a chance they might be interested. Gradually get to asking them whether they're gay, when you're comfortable.

UibsALccaa	Can you be a bit more specific please. What kind of topics?<br>  <br>  Sometimes talking can turn to gossiping and backbiting. In this case, yes. <br>  <br>  Some say the most dangerous weapon is the tongue, and this is kind of true. Not only will we be judged on our actions, but on our intentions too.|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Muslim's should abstain from topics of conversation that are:<br>  : Neither Deeni benefit nor worldly benefit.<br>  : Not speak sarcastically.<br>  : To deliberately make gheebat.<br>  : Dont use terms which are considered uncultural.<br>  : Dont indulge in story-telling unnecessarily - waste of time.<br>  : Dont crack such jokes which are hurting to others or speak in ways which embarrasses people.<br>  : Dont call anyone by detestable nicknames.<br>  : Dont speak mocking of anyone.<br>  : Never speak or blame anyone on the basis of mere suspicion.<br>  : Never engage in gossip, slander and scandalising.<br>  : Dont insult anyone by saying: faasiq, kaafir, mal'oon (cursed), the enemy of Allah (swt).<br>  : Dont be two-tongued.<br>  : Dont use the speech styles and slang of those who are ignorant of the Deen.<br>  : Dont mention such things which nauseates or disgusts other.<br>  The Qur'?n says we shall all be liable for all what we speak!<br>  "Think before speaking"<br>  Sometimes a wrong statement uttered without thinking leads one to Jahannum (Hell).<br>  The Prophet Muhammad  (saw) said:<br>  "One who takes care of  the thing which is between his jaws (tongue) and thighs, will with surety have their entry into Heaven".<br>  "The tongue takes a person flat on their nose and mouth, and leads them to Hell".|`|mVSC9aKoaa	"Talking" is an action of your tongue and sometime may have much severe consequences. Our faith start from testimony which is action of tongue.|`|qiHd8BCpaa	if you are asking them about certain things i dont think it is<br>  like if you're  curious about sex and so.. i dont think it is <br>  but if you talk dirty,if you already know those things and talk about it i think it would be<br>  but dont be afraid to ask anything to experienced people.. im pretty sure its not an issue|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	It is not permissible to discuss subtle matters of belief like those above in a social gathering in the form of an unbalanced dispute. As an uncontrolled contest, while being a panacea it becomes a poison. It is harmful for both those who speak and those who listen. It is permissible to discuss such matters moderately and fairly as an exchange of ideas.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	Actions are judged by intentions. There's no harm in just talking about something that is forbidden, as long as you don't do it. How else will you learn? If you're talking ill of a person though, yes its haram.

Keep bugging the school. The person who set up face book needs to be punished. He should be expelled. If you get the parents involved, something will get done. They can also write letters to the local newspapers complaining about the lack of action taken by the school. This is harassment just like gay bashing or going after someone because he is Black, Jewish, Arab, handicapped, etc. .  <br>  I'm not hi tech so I wouldn't know what to do about contacting facebook. <br>  Keep it up. There is an old yiddush word (Jewish) -- "mensch" ---it means a real human being.  That's what you are. You are sticking your neck out for another person. I admire you. Have a great life.|`|QXcbS8C1aa	tell the principle but tell him to keep it confidential. wrong section by the way, way uncool to post it here.|`|SZdVYrSSaa	Take a stand. Administration has a lot of pull in this area, you could print out the header page and take it to a school councilor, who will then have a list of all the members and be able to talk to them individually. <br>  <br>  Or, you could always put matters into your own hands (and this is only for the bold and reckless, not a suggestion, but more of a "if it were me") you could find the guy who made the group in the first place, and beat the hell out of him. Even if you just get his blood pumping, find him in a hallway, come up behind him, and throw him into a locker, then grip onto his shirt, look him in the eye, and ask him, seriously, if he thinks screwing with mentally ill kids is a truly great use of his time, if he laughs, looks away, tries to move, keep on staring and wait for an answer. Once they are out of breath, and realize you are serious, you know you've got them. <br>  <br>  Again, suggestion one is the preferable one, but I had plenty of success defending the weak kids in school here and there with a little physical encounter. It also earns you a fairly good reputation.|`|81f426ea1d682a8c468eb0927ea64972aa	CC's right. You have to report it. If not, then this can escalate into something a bit more serious, of which might be irreversible. Not to be brash and extremist, but there are cases where suicide over the internet is caused by hate, where there is a life lost and the hater being criminally tried. So if anything, to save the chance of danger, go report it.|`|ds78ZSSRaa	harassment.  Talk to one of the staff member at your school about it. Some schools have some type of training to prevent bullying for the simple fact,  Columbine and other schools that have gotten shot up behind those very same reasons.

If you are looking for people with similar interests look for clubs or take art classes, or join sports.

Your ego is getting in the way of developing close relationships with other people. Arrogance is like personality B.O... you can't smell it, but others can from a mile away.<br>  <br>  People are attracted to other people's DIFFERENCES, especially true between the sexes. Stop looking for someone who has similar interests and values, because that will only end up in a predictable, boring relationship. Find people who are different, so there's always something new to learn and discover.<br>  <br>  Opposites attract. Nobody wants to hang around with someone just like them.

Of those, pollution is the only immediate concern.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	I'm only scared of the idiots who think that the planet is being watched over by a being who will "soon" recycle the entire thing and fix everything we've wrecked.  Those are the people who want the world to end, who don't care about polluting the planet we live on, who think that if we ask nicely in just the right way everything will be sorted out for us.<br>  <br>  We're on our own.  We need to be responsable for taking care of the world we live on, since we kind of need it to survive.  <br>  <br>  As for the bit about "no support"...you have heard of this thing called "gravity", right?

You pollute the Earth as well and the way your saying it you don't want to worry about preserving the Earth because you believe God won't let anything happen to it.

This is for sure, once you leave your house and walk out the door you are exposed to all the elements of anything and everything that is out there. It’s sad to say but it is true, you can’t expect other people to think like you, do as you would do. Once you leave your home you got to be prepared for anything. And you should bear in mind that there are all kinds of people in the world, as a girl and a young girl on her own in the street, you got to be prepared for everything. You watch TV, you listen to the news, you hear about people getting hurt and worse. To get mad or allow yourself to get pissed off in the street could get you hurt. You can’t let anyone run over you but at the same time you can’t show your shook over it either. People will take advantage of you if they know that they are getting to you. As a girl you have to out think them with the mind like playing a poker hand, don’t let them see you sweat over it.<br>  <br>   I have been to many of the Islands in the Pacific to the Sea of Japan, Asia, Central America, Germany, Switzerland Holland and France, and in all those places the people, the culture were more friendly than the people right here at home. Don’t expect people to do as you do, think as you think, because everyone is different and if you allow it they will pull you down in to a hole or worse. The order of the day (each day) is to do what you got to do and get home safe. If you want to say something to a fool, do it in your own head so you don't get a response that will bring on trouble. Just out think those fools.|`|RDxbbCHwaa	Take pity on her. You have just met an individual who lives a completely wretched existence who feels that they have no voice and no true influence or control over their own lives.

This will quickly be replaced by their usual angry self-loathing personalities until they find their next opportunity.<br>  <br>  Once again take pity on her, because her life really sucks and is likely to never change.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	It really was a stupid over reaction. <br>  Try to be cool.<br>  If she had been in a better frame of mind, you could have asked innocently what she meant.<br>  <br>  But since she was over over the top, she might have gotten slapped.

He turned to you because he thought he could trust you and you walked away.........<br>  That is cold. <br>  Were you afraid that he would come on to you? That's a common fear with straight people. We do not like to come on to straight people. It is embarrassing and frustrating to us. LOL  <br>  If you care for this person, contact the gay center and pflag.org and ask to speak to someone about your discomfort. He is still the same person but he shared a secret with you. Your reaction must have hurt him badly.<br>  If there is any way that you can still be his friend, consider it. You don't want to throw away all the time spent together getting close.  Most people turn away because of all the rubbish they've heard thru their churches. Depending on how much you believe that will effect how you relate to your friend in this new situation. We  (gay people) still need our straight friends.

I hope you are living in a cave, because everything in this world we rely on to live has come about because of SCIENCE.

But Jesus made God's ideal very plain: At creation he approved one kind of marriage bond, man and woman. These become one flesh---one before God.<br>  <br>  People who claim to be "homosexuals" have chosen to give up their natural use of their bodies for complex reasons . At best, it is a human invention without any biblical precedent. Heterosexual monogamy is God's plan for marriage---the best plan, the only plan.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't cure it ,...nothing will.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is considered an acceptable practice by many in our world today---even by some churches . But society does not set the standard for God's Law. Many homosexuals believe that their desires are normal and that they have a right to express them. God does not encourage us to fulfill all of our desires. Desires that violate his laws must be controlled.<br>   If one has these desires, one can and must resist them. Consciously avoid places or activities you know will kindle temptations. Don't underestimate the power of Satan to tempt you or the potential for serious harm if you continue to yield to these temptations. Remember, God can and will forgive sexual sins just as he forgives other sins. People with homosexual tendencies must surrender yourselves to the grace and mercy of God, asking him to show you the way out of sin and into the light of his freedom and his love.Prayer, Bible study, and loving support of Christians in a Bible-believing church can help you to gain strength to resist these powerful temptations.If you are already deeply involved in homosexual behavior, seek help from a trustworthy, professional Christian counselor.|`|G7SiH0ohaa	Homosexuality is natural, it can't be cured.<br>  <br>  Bigot.|`|BMgIhRLOaa	Repenting and accepting the Lord is the first step in recovery!

mRLYY14Yaa	Japanese are not as homogeneous as they'd like to believe themselves to be. But are Polynesians related to Japanese? Well Japanese scientists have shown the makeup to be, 25% Chinese, 25% Korean, 16% Okinawan, 5% Ainu, 5% "Japanese", and 16% others.  Maybe the 16% others consists of the Malayo Polynesian-Austronesian groups, as Japan was a refuge for many types of people in the past. However, I don't think there were enough to say that Polynesians are really related to Japanese, or else Japanese would look more Polynesian, which they don't in any way. So no, you can't say that Polyneisan bloodlines have a connection with Japanese Samurai.

The source of this apparently lay in a Latin pun: by eating the "malus" ('apple'), Eve contracted "malum" ('evil')."<br>  <br>  "The Book of Enoch 32:4, dating from the last few centuries before Christ and purporting to be by the antediluvian prophet Enoch, describes the Tree of Knowledge: "It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!" "<br>  <br>  "In the Talmud, Rabbi Meir says that the fruit was a grape. Another Talmudic tradition suggests that Eve actually made and drank wine. Rabbi Nechemia says that the fruit was a fig while Rabbi Yehuda, is that the fruit was wheat."<br>  <br>  "Proponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is known now as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a pomegranate. This ties in with the Greek myth of Persephone, where her consumption of six pomegranate seeds leads to her having to spend time in Hades."<br>  <br>  "Some Slavonic texts state that the "forbidden fruit" was actually the grape, that was later changed in its nature and made into something good, much as the serpent was changed by losing its legs and speech. Other Eastern Christians sometimes assume that the "forbidden fruit" was the fig, from the account of their using leaves of this tree to cover themselves. There are also opinions that it was tomato (however, tomatoes are native to the American continent, thus unknown in Eurasia in biblical times) because this fruit in some Slavic languages is called "raj?ica" or "paradajz", (both words are related to paradise - "raj" means "paradise").

In a world where there is so little good compared to the masses of bad that is the only hope they have. And I, for one, am also "on the fence" in the topic of a "supreme being".|`|lgIHyNNAaa	to be honest i agree with u|`|pKwtA1siaa	listen, im not gunna tell u the whole story of the Bible but my grandpa explained it to me in a way that VERY few people think of. i wish thats how we all get taught the Bible because its literally fullproof and there wouldn't be these kinds of arguments. even my pastor can't explain it like that. you have to do research and read way between the lines of the Old Kings James Bible and do lots of research. and what you'll get is true facts that can be proven in modern science today. but you'll probably just sit there and cus me out over the comp so you dont have to listen to me but im telling you the truth. i thought the same thing as you thought untill i was enlighted.|`|qj9XKQXpaa	(Jk, just saw your additional details. Oh well, I'll post it anyway.)<br>  <br>  While I do agree with you philosophy as I am an agnostic atheist myself, with all due respect, I think it might be your presentation that make people laugh. Judging from the language you use when explaining your views, it appears that you aren't presenting an educated, informed decision about your views on religion, but rather an opinion formed after someone else's initial thought on the matter. This is just an impression and by no means an assumption about how you think.<br>  <br>  However, I do totally understand your frustration. I don't try to force my thoughts on this matter on people, but I seriously have to sit back and laugh at the naivete of some people. There are just some you will never convince, especially without a doctorate. "The God Delusion" by Dawkins is one of the best books I've ever read and is definitely one I recommend to almost everyone I have this discussion with.
OTnSwNwZaa	WTF is scene?|`|msNXomjTaa	Where I live, being "in the Scene" means you are gay, but living out - like, telling everyone you are gay, going to gay clubs, and so on.<br>  <br>  I'm kind of curious what the "scene" you are referring to is....|`|Uy58ixnvaa	I haven't met a lot of scene people, and the only one I know personally I think it is a fake.

One scene ,kids whow asn't a poser. he was a real scene kids. He listened to indie or rock bands that were not popular at ALL. He had glasses and long wavy brown hair going all across his face,yet he slicked it back. he was really attractive,he just kind of hid it. he wore thick glasses, he  dressed more like an asian grandpa than a loser "scene kid". he spoke his mind and didn't care what people thought. A TRUE scene kid.Funny thing is,the posers made fun of HIM. Also,my first boyfriend. Most scene kids you see are suburbanite white kids just trying to find something else to piss there parents off.
uAKBGfAlaa	It's good to see someone actually genuinely care about their friends.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is just let him know that you are his friend and that you will be there for him whenever he needs you.  Also let him know that God will also be there for him during the rough times of his life.  <br>  <br>  Joshua 1:9 <br>  "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the aLord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest"<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  D&C 121:7-8. <br>  "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes"<br>  <br>  Those two scriptures have really helped me through many hard times.

No specific talk comes to mind, but after doing a little searching there you will be inspired by something.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just read March's Ensign and it talked of single people using the scriptures. There was one in there about a man who started to read them because he felt lonely. Then as he read he started to feel the love of Heavenly Father through all the blessings he offers us. How he fave us this world and how he desires us to be happy. Heavenly father DESIRES us to be happy. See that talk and maybe it can help you explain this to him, and help he draw to learning how Heavenly Father does love us.|`|jTVbjyghaa	Then tell him something that will make him happy.|`|bKwCs8zhaa	A question would be nice.|`|LqyOHY37aa	Maybe you could let him wear your magical underpants...|`|udUzdU7Raa	Hello!<br>  Hmm... that's a hard one.

Explain that God always does what is best for us and he will be a better person if he can get through this trialling time. As for your feelings, just say it how it is! Tell them they are one of your best friends, and that you want the best for them too. Mention that it does upset you to see them feeling so down. You may want to invite them to Church for some spiritual uplifting. Or, print them some articles on trial from lds.org (I put a good one below).<br>  <br>  I hope your friend is feeling better soon!|`|dlXqtD99aa	Suggest to him that he should get a blessing! Also make sure that you listen to the promptings of the Spirit when you're talking with him.<br>  <br>  Also you can quote 1 Nephi 11:17 "And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things."|`|VQmHIrStaa	You could show him the Mormon South Park episode.<br>  <br>  I showed it to my Mormon dad and it cheered him up once.

We couldn't do that without discussion of one kind or another.  <br>  <br>  Everyone has the freedom to walk away when a Christian tries to tell them of Jesus, or put their 'phone down or rip up a letter or turn off the T.V. when the preacher comes on etc.  To my knowledge no Christians tie down people and say "You are going to remain there until I've told you all this".  <br>  <br>  The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gift, the best gift anyone could ever have, BUT, just like any other gift it will be either accepted or rejected.  Those who reject Jesus forfeit their future with Him. The choice is theirs and YOURS.|`|ExCAedp4aa	Universalism: Many religions believe that their truth is a universal truth that applies to everyone.

If I don't accomplish any of these before I die or turn 65 and a half (which ever comes first), then I can't get to Gargon 7 (that's the planet on the other side fo the universe where paradise is). I guess in the long run, it's just easier to insult 50 people than it is the convert 5. But killing might be fun too.... That's what the fundamentalist Kaidaoians do!!!|`|sQ2vg6jVaa	Because the truth can sometimes be divisive. All religions cannot be right and this causes friction.<br>  <br>  Jesus said in Matthew 10:34 '...Do not suppose I have come to bring peace to the earth.

If you knew only truth was relayed to you, what would your life be like?<br>  <br>  Some have love for others because they have chosen Christ. They have found that this is real. And from Him a great desire to share this overflows. They are willing to risk rejection because of their relationship with Christ, they know He is... He exists. How people reach out is as different as each one of us is different. We all can work on our people skills... getting along.<br>  <br>  Many on R&S will tell you there is heaven and hell and that you will spend eternity in one of these two places depending on your choice about who Jesus the Christ is. Might it be worth finding out the truth about this? Might this be more important than your 401K?<br>  <br>  The Holy Bible has much record of Christ and His words. Would you consider reading it? I believe God will show you a great many things if you are open.<br>  <br>  I would like to urge you to acquire a NIV or NKJV Bible.

6GNqMJB4aa	Well, not every use of sarcasm is meant to be rude.  But it does tend to take people off gaurd when it is used.  I know that I tend to get annoyed by it, even if it isn't being used in a hurtful way.  I used to work with someone like that and after awhile, I had to confront her about it.  She used sarcasm in a witty, meant to be funny way, but she also made me a constant target of it and I got annoyed by her after a while and finally put her in her place because of what she was doing.   But if it is done sparingly, then I let it roll of my back because I know that it wasn't being done in a mean spirited way.  But some people do use sarcasm to really put you down.  Sometimes sarcasm is used as a defense mechanism or sometimes it is used if someone is annoyed by someone and wants to hurt them a little bit verbally,  I sometimes use sarcasm if I am not being taken seriously if I try to tell someone something in a nice way.  I think that you can differentiate between funny sarcasm and meanspirited sarcasm by the tone, the circumstances, and the situation it is being used in.  Like if you and a coworker have a bunch of work to do and one of you says "Boy, this looks like fun", well that is a lighthearted use of sarcasm because you are commenting on the big workload by saying the exact opposite of what you mean. Because what you really mean is that the workload is a pain in the butt and you are going to be doing the work for a while before it gets finished.  A mean use of sarcasm would be if you told someone "Oh your hairstyle looks good" but you said it in a mean tone of voice and you really meant that the person's hairstyle was ugly.  The person that you are talking too will know that you did not really mean what you said and will most likely be offended by your comment.|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	It depends on how they say it and what it's about.

1eLOi65Zaa	As has been said, you should check the box with which you most identify if there isn't a mixed race box.<br>  <br>  You have what's called "white skin privilege" from what you describe, which means you aren't as discriminated against as others who share your ancestry, but that doesn't mean that is how you identify culturally.<br>  <br>  Would you say being a Pacific Islander has affected you or influenced your day-to-day life?<br>  <br>  My instinct is to tell you to check "Caucasian" because Portugal, Ireland and Scotland are all European countries and are anthropologically referred to as caucasoid.  Also, your father apparently descends from Hawaii after it was influenced by caucasion culture.<br>  <br>  It does confuse me when you say your ancestors trace back to Azores since they were originally unoccupied islands until they were settled by Europeans in the 15th century.  (No, I didn't just know that, I looked it up...)<br>  <br>  Overall, I don't know much about Hawaiian and Pacific Islander culture and what constitutes a Pacific Islander, but according to wikipedia, "Pacific Islander (or Pacific Person, pl: Pacific People, also called Oceanic[s]), is a geographic term to describe the Austronesian inhabitants of any of the three major sub-regions of Oceania: Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia."<br>  <br>  Portugal, of course, is not a Spanish speaking country, so it would not be considered Hispanic.<br>  <br>  Sorry for being disorganized and possibly repeating myself, but I hope I helped.|`|EuKGCrzkaa	Oi, tudo bem? well, if you dont know how to fluently speak portuguese, i suggest you dont check hispanic, because you sure as hell dont deserve the title. check white. but if you do know how to speak it, you should check Hispanic/latino, because that is your major portion of ethnicity.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	just say u belong to earth.<br>  <br>  my case is worst.<br>  dad's full from kerala.<br>  ma's mom half karnatakan and half marathi.ma's dad was half karnatakan and half from kerala.so mom is confused and so am i!<br>  three languages and a very bad mix.<br>  <br>  like they say in hindi,"teen thigada kaam bigada"<br>  meaning threesome causes trouble|`|o2N5zzEGaa	white/caucasion!!<br>  <br>  ur not from ne spanish descent countries so deff not hispanic nd ur father was born in hawaii a state in the states so unless he is hawian like looks it nd all ur not really a pacific islander ur white!<br>  <br>  hope ive helped!=]|`|uiDJlhy5aa	Caucasian.

If you are referring to the use of GOD in most Bibles, it is a replacement for the Tetragrammaton (Hebrew letters for YHWH or JHVH).  This is the true name of GOD.  Usually the English way of saying it is Yahweh or Jehovah.  At some point, somebody took the "hallowed by Thy name" part of the Lord's Prayer quite literally and decided that it was sinful to keep referring to GOD by his proper name (also, over the years the true pronunciation has been lost, so nobody truly knows how to properly pronounce the name of GOD), so almost all of the instances where the Tertagrammaton was used, the Biblical writers replaced it with GOD or The LORD.  This tradition continues down to today.<br>  <br>    If, however, you are asking WHY God created humans, then that's a simple question.  According to the Bible, humans were created because God wanted worshipers who had free will.  Angels are simply created creatures with no free will of their own (although that point can be argued because of Genesis 6:1-4).  Angels worship God because they have no other choice; man has free will and can reject God.  So the act of worship by free willed humans means so much more.<br>  <br>  If, on the third hand, you are asking which creation story (Christian, Muslim, Hindu, etc.) you are to believe, then that is a question only you can answer.  I can probably argue fairly well for Christianity, but someone of Hindu faith can probably argue just as effectively.  You and you alone must decide where to best place your faith.  Or you can simply have no faith at all and believe in Evolution.  As stated, you have free will and can decide on your own.|`|SqiDih7Zaa	IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION U LL  BE ABLE TO ASK HIM IN PERSON WHEN YOU DIE, ODNT WORRY ABOUT UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING NOW|`|3W9q3Emtaa	The God that believes in you and everyone else.

(Ps.83:18 KJV)  <br>  <br>  There's a scripture that comes to mind at Matthew 5:3 it says "Happy are those that are conscience of their spiritual need". <br>  <br>  We were created with this need to be filled and unless it is we will feel like something is missing.

Many people raised Catholic know very little about the Church.  <br>  <br>  The Catechism of The Catholic Church is available from Amazon.com for  less than twenty dollars.   <br>  <br>  I also recommend you get in touch with a Catholic priest to discuss your search for a richer spiritual and religious life.   <br>  <br>  Most people who are serious about getting closer to God have to work very hard at it.  It is not always an easy thing to do.   God's Grace is often received through a great deal of hard work in the forms of prayer, study, and good works.   <br>  <br>  You said you are depressed.  Perhaps you should consult a medical doctor for evaluation,  but it sounds to me like you are unhappy with specific conditions of your life.  That is not a medical disorder.  I know of no greater treatment for the sort of depressed mood you are describing than doing good things for others.  Volunteer at a homeless shelter, hospital, or nursing home.  Start going to a Catholic Church near you, and ask how you could help the parish in some way.  <br>  <br>  A great book about difficult human life is a true masterpiece written by Viktor Frankl.  The title is "Man's Search for Meaning."  Viktor Frankl was a Jewish medical doctor who survived the NAZI concentration camps.  His book is excellent.  He found meaning in that horrid experience.  I am confident that his book would be useful to you.<br>  <br>  I am praying for your well-being as I write this.<br>  I hope and pray that you come to find <br>  Peace in God The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	I am a catholic so I suggest to give catholicism another look.

I know that you are in southern California, which I know nothing about churches there.  The only church that I know of in California is in Desert Palm, CA.  The pastor is David Moore.  If I were you, and you are not near Desert Palm....I would call David Moore's Church and see if they could recommend a church in your area.<br>  <br>  I agree with the answer that states you need Jesus, not a religion.  The key is to have a relationship with Jesus.  Once you make the step of asking Jesus into your heart (based on your catholic background, you probably never did that) the Holy Spirit will live IN YOU!  That is the only thing you NEED to do.  You need to pray to God and admit that you are a sinner and need a Savior (Jesus).  You then go on to say that you accept Jesus' payment for your sins.  The Holy Spirit will then come into you.  You can't get more spiritual than that!!<br>  <br>  After that huge step, you need to work on your relationship with God by spending time reading The Bible, praying, and having fellowship with other spirit-filled believers.   <br>  <br>  One thing you need to know, there are a lot of people who claim that they are Christians who have NEVER asked Jesus into their heart and accepted his FREE gift of salvation.  They are just going through the motions.  Based on the fact that you used to attend the catholic church....that may mean everyone you know.  The catholic church fails to tell people that they NEED to make that step.  It is like they think salvation comes from the church or something.

You can go to church all your life and not feel happy, unless you have faith. When you say that when you pray, things get worse, well who or what were you praying to? Pray to God! I am telling you and guarantee that if you surrender your life to him, your life will definitely change for the better. In the Bible it says "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life." -John 3:16. You might have heard that before, but it's the truth. I may sound like a religious freak to others, but I promise you, it's the only way. Another verse says: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come." —2 Corinthians 5:17. Just pray to God and ask him to come into your heart and forgive you from your sins. Simple as that. Jesus loves you! :)|`|AA12230258	The Bible does not agree with the modern view that there are many acceptable ways to worship God. Ephesians 4:5 says there is “one Lord, one faith.” Jesus stated: “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it. .?.?. Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.”—Matt. 7:13, 14,?21; see also 1?Corinthians 1:10.<br>  <br>  Repeatedly the Scriptures refer to the body of true Christian teachings as “the truth,” and Christianity is spoken of as “the way of the truth.” (1?Tim. 3:15; 2?John 1; 2?Pet. 2:2) Because Jehovah’s Witnesses base all of their beliefs, their standards for conduct, and organizational procedures on the Bible, their faith in the Bible itself as God’s Word gives them the conviction that what they have is indeed the truth. So their position is not egotistical but demonstrates their confidence that the Bible is the right standard against which to measure one’s religion. They are not self-centered but are eager to share their beliefs with others.<br>  <br>  You can find them at your local Kingdom Hall or they will be knocking at your door to share Bible truths with you. All 7 million of us believe exactly the same thing all over the world, we are in complete harmony with the Bible.|`|HVLCWByKaa	Personally I wouldn't worry too much about a specific religion. Instead focus on spirituality, you don't need a religion to do this. Think about what it is you believe, if you are not sure read up on different beliefs and see which ones make the most sense to you. I gave up on religion several years ago because it just wasn't helping me. I started exploring other paths and found one in paganism. There are so many different beliefs and paths in paganism it was easy for me to call myself a pagan. Once you find your spiritual path, then you can start looking for a group that believes the way you do so that you may have fellowship with them.

But most people choose a religion based appeal, honestly a religion should be chosen based on the evidence of truth. Here are some evidences, SCIENTIFIC evidences provided by the holy Quran...<br>  <br>  1) The Sun and Moon.<br>  Whereas the Bible talks of the sun and the moon as two lights differing only in size, the Qur'an distinguishes between them by the use of different terms: light (noor) for the moon, and lamp (siraaj) for the sun.<br>  "Did you see how Allah created seven heavens, one above the other, and made in them the moon a light and the sun a lamp?" Qur'an, 78:12-13<br>  The moon is an inert body which reflects light, whereas the sun is a celestial body in a state of permanent combustion producing both light and heat.<br>  from: Whyislam.org<br>  <br>  2)“And We sent down Iron, in which is great might, as well as many benefits for mankind…”(Quran, 57:25). The reference to Iron in this quote is much more specific than it seems.  The fact that it states “sent down” infers that iron was not already a part of Earths matter, but later became a part of Earth during its birth.  According to the nebula theory, this description fully coincides.  Asides from these three quotes that have strengthened my belief in Islam and modern science, there is one more odd aspect of the Quran’s reference to Iron. In the Holy Quran there are 114 chapters all together, and the chapter that references iron that is also named “The Iron”, is the 57th chapter.  With simple division we can see that half of 114 is 57, this means that the chapter “Iron” is the center of the Quran.  Of what else is iron the center? It turns out that iron is the main component that makes up the core of planet earth.  This seems awkward to most, perhaps a coincidence, but we all know that the Lord works in mysterious ways.<br>  <br>  3)Expansion of the Universe<br>  <br>  Chapter ath-Thaariyaat of the Qur'an also seems to allude to one of the most imposing discoveries of modern science, the expansion of the Universe.<br>  <br>  "I built the heaven with power and it is I, who am expanding it." Qur'an,51:47<br>  <br>  The expansion of the universe was first suggested by the general theory of relativity and is supported by the calculations of astrophysics. The regular movement of the galactic light towards the red section of the spectrum is explained by the distancing of one galaxy from another. Thus, the size of the universe appears to be progressively increasing.<br>  from: whyislam.org<br>  <br>  - These evidences i provided are enough for you to see truth in one religion.

But please Neil, she wasn't talking about fiction...<br>  <br>  I'm versatile, and honestly enjoy both, and have been with women as well, but when pitching in Anal Sex, it's simply wonderful. I mostly played top to my first boyfriend and we were both virgins when we met, so every time (plenty "uptight" and no condoms) was amazing. It's like so warm, and you can feel everything, and the rhythm of your hand stroking him transfers to you while your inside him, and (due to positioning) your bodies are basically locked into each other as tight as they can be. It is wonderful, and loving, but mostly, the word I have for it is warm. <br>  <br>  I don't know that I can truly explain to you what it feels like, but I can tell you that it is honestly the best sex I have had, over bottoming for another guy, and being with a woman, pitching, bareback, to another virgin, was sublime.|`|HtKKcq98aa	Well it would be quite different for you since you are female and therefore lack a prostate gland. that's sort of like the equivalent of the male g-spot and one of the only ways you can stimulate that is through anal sex.<br>  <br>  At first it starts out where you are thinking "omg why am i letting you do this to me again?!?!" because the mussels need to be relaxed.

It can feel much more intense than masturbation with less control of when things happen - especially when there's a really cute guy bouncing on top. The just before feeling is so intense that there's nothing I can compare it against and it's a very addictive feeling.

These questions can be answered in the affirmative. Who is this prophet?...This "prophet" was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian Witnesses...Of course, it is easy to say that this group acts as a ‘prophet' of God. It is another thing to prove it." The Watchtower, 4/1/72, p. 197. (See Deut. 18:21) <br>  11 months ago<br>  1897 "Our Lord, the appointed King, is now present, since October 1874," Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 4, page 621.<br>  <br>  1899 "...the ‘battle of the great day of God Almighty' (Revelation 16:14), which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth's present rulership, is already commenced." The Time Is at Hand, page 101 (1908 edition). <br>  <br>  1916 "The Bible chronology herein presented shows that the six great 1000 year days beginning with Adam are ended, and that the great 7th Day, the 1000 years of Christ's Reign, began in 1873." The Time Is at Hand, page ii, (forward). <br>  <br>  1918 "Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old, particularly those named by the Apostle in Hebrews 11, to the condition of human perfection." Millions Now Living Will Never Die, page 89. <br>  <br>  1922 "The date 1925 is even more distinctly indicated by the Scriptures than 1914." The Watchtower 9/1/22, page 262. <br>  11 months ago<br>  1923 "Our thought is, that 1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures. As to Noah, the Christian now has much more upon which to base his faith than Noah had upon which to base his faith in a coming deluge." The Watchtower, page 106 4/1/23. <br>  <br>  1925 "The year 1925 is here. With great expectation Christians have looked forward to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of the body of Christ will be changed to heavenly glory during this year. This may be accomplished. It may not be. In his own due time God will accomplish his purposes concerning his people. Christians should not be so deeply concerned about what may transpire this year." The Watchtower, 1/1/25, page. 3. <br>  <br>  1925 "It is to be expected that Satan will try to inject into the minds of the consecrated, the thought that 1925 should see an end to the work." The Watchtower, Sept, 1925 page 262. <br>  <br>  1926 "Some anticipated that the work would end in 1925, but the Lord did not state so. The difficulty was that the friends inflated their imaginations beyond reason; and that when their imaginations burst asunder, they were inclined to throw away everything." The Watchtower, page 232. <br>  <br>  1931 "There was a measure of disappointment on the part of Jehovah's faithful ones on earth concerning the years 1917, 1918, and 1925, which disappointment lasted for a time...and they also learned to quit fixing dates." Vindication, page 338. <br>  <br>  1941 "Receiving the gift, the marching children clasped it to them, not a toy or plaything for idle pleasure, but the Lord's provided instrument for most effective work in the remaining months before Armageddon." The Watchtower, 9/15/41, page 288. <br>  11 months ago<br>  1968 "True, there have been those in times past who predicted an ‘end to the world', even announcing a specific date. Yet nothing happened. The ‘end' did not come. They were guilty of false prophesying. Why? What was missing?.. Missing from such people were God's truths and evidence that he was using and guiding them." Awake, 10/8/68. <br>  <br>  1968 "Why are you looking forward to 1975?" The Watchtower, 8/15/68, page 494. <br>  <br>  A JW might say that the organization is still learning. If that is so, then how can they trust what they are taught now by the Watchtower? Will what they are being taught now change also? <br>  A true prophet of God won't err in prophesying. Only a false prophet does. The Jehovah's Witness organization, that claims to be a prophet of God, is really a false prophet. Jesus warned us by saying, "For false Christ’s and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect <br>  Mathew 24:24<br>  <br>  these are quotes from your own Watchtower, these are the false prophecies your heirarchy have posted throughout its life. How do you explain them? <br>  <br>  it was only a far back as 1975, that TWTS predicted the world would end, this is modern time history, people sold their homes in anticipation of the end of days, the leaders (President, Fred Franz,) encouraged this action, they believed it that much they encouraged people to sell their homes and use the money to spread the good word. I am sorry! but TWTS has always, until recently, Prophesied several times the end of the world, these false prophecies are against the very source of your faith, the bible. <br>  <br>  How can a faith be true; if it can change its values and doctrine from the original, wouldn't that mean it loses credibility? How do you know, that what the TWB&TS teaches you now, won't change in the future? <br>  <br>  NMB; these are quotes taken from the WT relating to the many prophecies that the leaders of the JW's had released through books and pamphlets through the years until 1975.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	The apostle Peter wrote: “You know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his?

In a way it make sense when debbie said they have to die first, but would that be from 'natural' causes (ageing), rather than leaving their earthly existence when armageedon happens? We do know that before the end all the anointed must be 'sealed' that they must have proved their faithfullness to the end.<br>  <br>  The anointed were chosen from 33ce onwards when the holy spirit was sent to the apostles and others in attendance at Pentecost. Most of the anointed were in the beginning of the time when Jehovah's (bible students in those days) witnesses started their work. By 1935, a far more considerable proportion were of the 'great crowd' and so had the earthly hope.|`|94aceb82c6668e0fc341436367b2d246aa	No one knows for sure.

2NRCJgq2aa	Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species, in contrast with microevolution, which refers to smaller evolutionary changes (typically described as changes in allele frequencies) within a species or population.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Don't confuse them with facts.

That all living things evolved from a single-cell organism by small changes. Showing the small changes of a fish evolving into a land animal, or a wolf-like creature evolving into a whale would be a couple of examples.Imagination does not count; only reality.<br>  A dog being breed into different types of dogs, or birds evolving larger beaks would not be macro evolution.<br>  The fossil record does not blend together by small changes, so macro evolution did not happen in the past.<br>  If small changes in living things were cumulative, all life would be transitional forms. So macro evolution is not happening now.|`|AA11466759	Evolution means change that occurs over a great length of time<br>  It's opposite is Revolution:  change that occurs in a short period of time.<br>  <br>  all other definitions are convoluted and counterproductive to clarity.<br>  <br>  Adaptation is what you want for accuracy in this sense.|`|756012ab0251e75276bfcdb01caf9285aa	there is no such thing as macro-evolution or micro-evolution. there is only evolution|`|CkdSTD1Baa	There really is no such thing as micro and macro evolution.

qRFTEBlGaa	What will happen to young children at Armageddon?<br>  <br>  The Bible does not directly answer that question, and we are not the judges. However, the Bible does show that God views the young children of true Christians as “holy.” (1?Cor. 7:14) It also reveals that in times past when God destroyed the wicked he likewise destroyed their little ones. (Num. 16:27,?32; Ezek. 9:6) God does not want anyone to be destroyed, so he is having a warning sounded now to benefit both parents and children. Would it not be wise for parents to pursue a course that would result in their children being looked on with favor by God both now and at Armageddon?|`|zyxY4dbMaa	That is what they teach.|`|XlhR7ooHaa	I see you're point.

rADpGLeJaa	The reasons of why IT down in the world is a burning question before the world Scientists & Technocrats. If we go back history of IT then mostly the techniques come out from Radio Science or Physics . Radio Physics can be said birth of our present IT. In this regard, I would like to draw attention on the discussions of our Scientist of Eminence( Dr. A.P.Mitra,C.S.I.R. India) in Radio Physics(see, Website: www.rfrs.org.in,June 2007) where one can find that Radio Physics covers a wide spectrum of disciplines of IT industries which have become an integral part of our day-to-day life. The Radio Science was known earlier to worldly Scientists. Thereby, IT Industries have come in to the present shape. However, just after the second world war the other problem in Applied Physics remain unsolved such as Uncertainty Free Phenomena in Science & Technology. This problem was the origin of German Physicists and lucky one Indian Physicist  was also in that team of work. Thereby,Indian Physicists were able to guide to others to carry on work on such said Phenomena of Science & Technology.(see,www.opmisra.com). The lack of scientific thinking in IT Industries are also responsible for their limited boundaries. IT Industries have never helped to other Industry as pointed out about Uncertainty Free Phenomena In Science & Technology. They were only limited to earn money by their products. Also, these Industries have never permit to go in other directions. Thirdly, as stated our respected Maharishi Dayanand Sarswati in an answer to English Man during British period in India: British rule would not continue more in India as English men became more lasy and comfortable persons after getting power in India. Similarly, in the world,the power of thinking of persons have come down due to comfortable enjoyment by the IT Industries. Even the people have no faith on God and they say Men have given us Internet and not by God.In other words, misuse of IT Industries  by our young mind can also be said one of the factors. Thanks to the questioner for asking timely question about down of IT Industries and its reasons.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	When the income is down naturally the IT is also down.|`|GdJTQX6raa	Global melting and recession are the vital reason for IT down|`|0WB5Tru5aa	You mean 'spiritually speaking' of course.

i46hr7duaa	Xtianity is the belief that Jesus was God, and atheism is the opinion that there is no god. So it's a contradiction of terms.|`|rNaIRu4baa	That is because it is a ridiculous claim. It is comparable to saying that you are a communist but you believe in the capitalist way. The only way something like that can happen is if you are forced to be one way, in public, but feel another way mentally. For example, I know many people who were born into a christian family, who don't believe in their religion. They don't tell their parents because they don't want to upset them, but they feel the opposite way none the less.<br>  <br>  The collaboration of christianity and atheism is similar to the collaboration of an electron and an anti-electron. They cancel each other out.<br>  <br>  If an atheist ever claims that he follows the bible, he is blowing smoke. What he means to say is that he appreciates a few of the moral teachings of the bible, but picks and chooses what to believe.<br>  <br>  For example, if he works on sunday (the sabbath day), he is committing a sin punishable by death. If he lie's or disrespects his parents, and is not physically punished, he is not following the bible! If he doesn't forgive everyone and love everyone and give all his money and time to helping others, he is not following the bible!<br>  <br>  Don't be surprised though; In today's day and age, it is almost impossible to find someone who doesn't pick and choose what to believe from their bible.|`|i444oWjjaa	They try to live by the moral teachings of Jesus, but don't accept any of the supernatural.<br>  <br>  Think about what Jefferson did when he made his Bible by excising all the miracles, and you get the flavor of what they are trying to do.<br>  <br>  It isn't like "Jews for Jesus" because there's no deception involved. "Jews for Jesus" is an Evangelical proselytizing group, posing as Jews to better target Jews for conversion.|`|0WB5Tru5aa	It's probably a response to social pressure from being surrounded by hordes of Christians who don't like atheists. So instead of simply being moral atheists, they attach the word 'Christian' to their atheism and get social points.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	To a Christian-Atheist, Christianity becomes a personal philosophy rather than a theistic religion. That's the only difference.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	It might stem from a desire to take Jesus as teacher rather than Jesus as Christ.<br>  <br>  People look for meaning in their lives, for values to hold onto, for values to live by, for guidance, even Atheists.  Jesus can provide that for some.  This is why an atheist might add Christian to describe their worldview.  They may not believe in a supernatural benevolent presence, but they might like the teachings of a man who believed in love and made it his mission in life to teach a core group of students how to love after he left.  This in some ways sounds like a feel-good Robin Williams movie.<br>  <br>  Regardless of religion, the most important thing is that people love each other.  I think I get it perfectly.  Some people are uncomfortable with things that challenge their reason or their comfort-zones but are still looking for someone to believe in.  Jesus can be that, even for atheists.|`|CueEJOVFaa	I don't know why anyone would call herself a Christian atheist, but how do you know that this wasn't a Christian who attached the word atheist to her worldview?

We have hardly begun to explore the existing flora and fauna of our planet.  Just because we have only recently observed and recorded the existence of some creature for the first time does not mean that the creature did not previously exist.   Our knowledge is not the creative force behind the existence of any creatures.|`|3E6lf2cJaa	I don't know, but I guessing they didn't just drop out of the sky.. they must've been here before but were not discovered.<br>  <br>  And perhaps in some cases macro-evolution happened, such as how black moths suddenly appeared after the industrial revolution blackened the skies of England.

InAICv25aa	The plus side of living in a country with lots of language is that your kids, that grow up there, will probably be automatic bilinguals or more. If you lived in a country with only one language, you might find it hard to learn a second one. <br>  <br>  The con is that people tend to socialize less on the streets. I've noticed this in Quebec... People simply hesitate before they talk, because there used to be some tensions between the French and the English factions, so you hear a lot less casual conversations between strangers. Likewise, there are often tensions between the cultures with different languages, not that there aren't tensions between social groups in the US that speak the same language.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	People don't work together well unless they can communicate well.

9BeUbORtaa	"Islam and Hinduism are the by far the most popular religions in India, and are vastly different. How could there NOT be some sort of conflict?"<br>  <br>  That's lazy thinking. In fact, there have been long periods of relative peace between Muslims and Hindus in India, interspersed with periods of violence and conflict. <br>  <br>  The current situation - of communitarian politics and suspicion between India and Pakistan, as well as conflict over Kashmir - is largely a product of colonial times, where the conflict between Muslims and Hindus was both exaggerated and exploited by Europeans. This culminated in the British drawing lines on a map, arbitrarily cutting off large chunks of the sub-continent into "Muslim" and "Hindu" states, uprooting millions of people on the 'wrong' side of the lines and unleashing the massive bloodshed of partition. <br>  <br>  It is an unfortunate situation, and one that still largely prevails today. But it is not the result of a timeless and eternal struggle between Muslims and Hindus. In reality, it is a fairly recent scenario, which is still cynically exploited by political interests on both sides of the border.|`|E870WbAsaa	Hindu thinks that india belongs to only hindu people, that's why they kill muslims n christian in india.<br>  <br>  Moreover the tension between the two countries is over the "kashmir" territory which belonged to pakistan, and after partition it was sold out to the colonial guys by the hindus.|`|WbaN6osZaa	I imagine it's like protestants and catholics (Northern Ireland), or Tom and Jerry, or sunnis vs shiites<br>  <br>  It's all a load of w*nk and people get hurt.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Hindus hate Muslims as they slaughter and eat their sacred cows.

I think I am being Indian, Hindu and from Mumbai city, I am eligible to answer you.<br>  <br>  Firstly, Slumdog Millionaire is a movie and to make movie exciting, crowd puller directors tend to make it peppier through some exxageration. So don't believe everythign whatever they have shown in the movie.<br>  <br>  Now I will answer your question. Look, India has 60% Hindu population, @20% Muslim population and rest is other minorities like Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Anglo-Indians etc.<br>  <br>  India, or "Hindustan" this name has originaed from Indus civilisation. Aryans migrated from Scandenavia to India, and settled on the bank of river Sindu (Indus) and this civilisation is called Indus - Hindu - India.<br>  This is 5000 years old civilisation. They up to middle India.<br>  <br>  India was the most developed country, most flourishing nation then, so if you happen to see history books, every other king invaded India. Including Alexnder the great, kings from Iran, Afganistan and Monguls. <br>  <br>  Lately in 14th century, the invaders were Muslims or followers of Islam.<br>  They ruled India for almost 300 years until British East India company defeted them in 18th century.<br>  <br>  During their reins, Islam begin to grow in India. Many citizens were forcefully converted to Islam, many of them sacrificed their life to keep their religion mainly Sikhs and Hindus.<br>  <br>  Hinduism is not a religion, it is a way of life.<br>  <br>  There are some subtle differences in two religions. Islam says there is only one god "Allah" and "Mohammad Paigambar" got sermon from him. So they don't beileve in Icons of deities. Whereas Hindus have many gods, they have temples where they worship idols. Another difference is Muslims eat beef, which is nothing but cow's meat, Hindus worship cow as a god, Muslims speak Urdu language, Hindus speak Hindi.<br>  <br>  But frankly, over last 500 years even after the indipendence, both the communities could not gel well because of motives political leaders. Britishers created Pakistan by dividing India. Many of the Muslims migrated to Pakistan but a big population remained in India, they became minorities. Distribution of population is also uneven. For example Kashimr is largely Muslim populated.<br>  <br>  Secondly - religion is like an opium. India is a democratic country. It is a secular country. Anybody can practise any religion. But there are some very fundamental and extremist groups like Al Kaida, Lashkar E Toiba from Pakistan and Afganistan who misguide Muslims to fight against Hindus.<br>  <br>  Belive me, the educated, literate class of population has gelled well with Muslims but thoese who are illitrate get provoked by this agenda.<br>  <br>  For example our previous president was Muslim, current vice president is Muslim, Our prime minister is a Sikh, The ruling party president is a lady from Italy. So we are secular. The music director of that movie is a Muslim guy, our biggest filmstar is Muslim.<br>  <br>  But some faction of people amongst Hindus and Muslim fight for their vested interests. This has been shown in the movie.<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you brief idea about the situation. Should you need more information, please feel free to contact me.

We've already began our first tentative steps into space, so who knows what the future will bring. I just wish I could be around to find out.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	I have faith we are smart enough to solve this problem. And, we have billions of years to do it. That is quite a large number.|`|dPYotwUxaa	We have 5 billion years to stock pile suntan lotion.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	We will be lucky if we don't destroy ourselves long before the sun goes nova|`|rNaIRu4baa	God, in short, did not leave us with a ticking time-bomb. Now, I don't believe that the God of the old testament is real, but I will assume he is for the sake of answering your question.<br>  <br>  When God made light, he made the planets, the stars, the grass, the animals, etc. Basically God created everything and, as said in the bible, has a plan for everything. <br>  <br>  If you are a religious man, then you should notice that the bible vividly talks about a tribulation period and a rapture period. Yes, fire is mentioned in these, but not the type that the sun would provide. The bible says that demons will walk the Earth, and balls of fire will fall from the sky, and wormwood will collide with Earth. That is way different than what would happen if the sun grew larger. Its true, the sun will use up its hydrogen fuel and expand in order to burn its carbon, and it is also true that the Earth will suffer. But it will happen very slowly over many years; the earth will get hotter and hotter and basically cook.<br>  <br>  Since this is not what is mentioned in the bible, then arguing this from the religious stance, everyone will either be in Heaven or hell at that time, and no one will be left on Earth.<br>  <br>  Tackling this from a scientific stance, you have nothing to worry about. The event will happen billions of years from now. Also, the Andromeda will collide with the milky way and yes, there will be another catastrophic collision of a meteor with Earth.<br>  <br>  But all these events take time.. More time than you or I have on this planet. More time than anyone has on this planet!<br>  <br>  Well, to be completely correct, all but the meteor strike take time. A meteor can his any time; we are in fact overdue for a civilization ending collision. But I would honestly tell you not to worry about this at all either! The probability of this happening with the Sun's and the Moon's and all the other planet's gravitational interactions, is extremely small.<br>  <br>  If you want to feel more comfortable, you should write a letter to the president asking him to add more money into NASA's counter space rock collision organization. As of now very little money is being put into developing technology that would defend the planet from an asteroid, but I hope that with the democrats in control, the government will take this issue more seriously!|`|hdFn4Dobaa	The Lord did not leave a time bomb, for the sun shall not kill us.<br>  <br>  The sun will not blow up or disintegrate. I don't know where you got your information, but it is not valid.<br>   It is not even in the Word of God for such a thing to happen. What the Lord made is good.<br>  No need to worry dear.

You should be worried that we are screwing up the world now and making it a dump for the rest of the billion years.|`|WY4hDntHaa	thats something we dont need to worry about..do what you can to help what can be helped and to change what can be changed. It is sad. People are scum..and theyre ignorant..but we're all only human.

5MVQrmMfaa	I love Big Love....<br>  <br>  If you know enough about the stereotypes and fundamentalist culture, it's hilarious.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	yes, IMO. it's a bit like 'the sopranos', but with mormons... and about as 'true to life', I guess.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	It is worth watching on HBO.|`|7a1853a34fef93b27c82b0bacf06c7c6aa	nope, none are worth spending cash for.
CfZn9kK5aa	It REALLY depends on what scenarios he was talking about. If it involved a child, then no, that is not normal. 2 consenting adults is one thing (and actually, a fairly common fantasy if you look up the statistics), but with a child it is never ok.<br>  <br>   IF it does indeed involve a child, and he would like to participate in an incestual interaction with a child, please suggest that he get psychological help, because that is not normal, and it is dangerous.|`|QXcbS8C1aa	in my opinion, incest is the worse thing ever.<br>  the word in general makes me cringe and grind my teeth because i think its disgusting and just not right.|`|E23s2wSNaa	im sure he was, most likley, i have weird friends like him that were abused in the past and think about incest, i know its weird but true|`|DIj072Sqaa	Just be there for him and don't probe too deeply. If this starts to become more of an issue and you really start to think he was abused then you should seek professional help. Regression therapy is good for recovering lost memories. However you should consider if he doesn't feel hurt by anything is there a need to open a wound?
mUK240ykaa	As it says in the URL, these are anagrams. <br>  <br>  The title "Luhopysao Hehiesuoi" can be made into "Yo-ho-ho! Ha! Issue up lie." or "Yo-ho-ho! Eh! Is usual pie."
fEkKuGlEaa	It says something about the person who holds the belief. One person's gullibility is another person's faith. <br>  <br>  Take a marriage for example: a wife finds evidence that her husband might be cheating. She says "no, I have faith in him." Others call her a wife with faith in her husband; others call her a gullible fool. But unless they know the future and can predict if he's going to be proven unfaithful or not, her friends can't know. Their predictions are just their belief. <br>  <br>  Funny how everybody is stupid for holding beliefs but ourselves. When we do it we just "know."|`|WF085j2Daa	nessacary prerequisite to faith perhaps<br>  edit: or the other way around perhqps|`|6jAVElX7aa	no it doesnt because belief and faith go together, and if you have faith in Christ Jesus, you will show the fruits thereoff.

gLVbSrx6aa	it's a turn off if you can feel all their bones when you hug them.|`|ZzYy2szvaa	I was so used to hugging my guy friends and... um... meaty? girl friends that when I hugged one of my really thin girl friends, I was like "there's nothing to hug!"  I love hugging one of my chubby girl friends!  She gives such amazing hugs.<br>  <br>  Also, I saw a guy the other day in a speedo, and you could see all his muscles, but not because he was built, but because he was so skinny it was like his skin was vacuum-packed over his muscles >.< ew...<br>  <br>  That's why I love guys so much, there's always something to hug.  I don't like very muscular or too fat, but anywhere in between is fine for me =)<br>  <br>  Wow... I sound so mean =( ...  I didn't mean anything to be offensive, I just generally enjoy hugging guys more (but not because I'm gay, although that does make it a bit of a bonus).|`|SWYB8iQEaa	I was always very athletic the thin type. You know trimmed with defined muscles but not big. My body was really flexible and easy to carry around. For the last year i was gaining mass because my bf thinks of kind the same way like u. Now, i've got bigger muscles and mass but even when i try to turn it feels weird. My bf has these big muscles and it's so suffocating when he falls on me when we sleep. I came to respect lighter bodies. But the very skinny ones you know the ones you touch the bones and bodies that have not been trained are really not my type.|`|jBTBMzPpaa	I like skinny girls/guys. I love a flat stomach. <br>  But when their ribs, spine and stuff stick out that's too skinny for me.|`|JgNMqaPmaa	not 2 skinny|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I don't really like skinny people, we need to eat!|`|iSvDvFneaa	They're fine to me, I'd just put a tinyyyyyy bit more meat on them. : )|`|aYqCb3olaa	haha not really, but you could influence them to eat more.|`|jinyM8fyaa	Yea I'm not a fan of skinny. I love a chick with some meat on her bones. Phoarr, lol. :)|`|QXcbS8C1aa	i like chubby guys lol :]<br>  chubbychaser4lif<br>  <br>  <br>  rad.shoes@yahoo.com|`|gWJqarq8aa	2 me its a huge turn off i don't wanna feel ur bones all up on me...lol<br>  <br>  i prefer a curvy girl!|`|ybn6beqiaa	Yeah, I get turned off by hugging a bag of bones.<br>  I love girls with a bit to hold onto.. <br>  I dont like skinny guys either, nor do I like muscles.. I think this is the reason why I dont like men as much as women...<br>  But yeah anyway, skinny isnt sexy to me.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Yes it's a huge turn off.|`|mIj958p1aa	im a bi dude & i prefer my dudes & chicks thin or athletic thin bods ;] im stick thin my ribs stick out not my fault im a vegetarian of 8 years with a high fast metabolism & good genetics ;] im also cute too ;] so what if im confident in myself? =p|`|uD1UFdRsaa	If I can feel or see the bones then that's too skinny for me. And yeah I don't want to feel like I'm gunna snap them in half with my hugs either :S majorly turn off.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Well my BFF is male and FINE as HELL <br>  ( He looks like Johnny Depp) .. He is thin as a rail, but I really don't mind I am still crushing on him...|`|HH90Eghaaa	Oh thats sad!<br>  I love skinny girls, I myself am one!
X9rXRNUxaa	We have here an account of the life and death of blessed Paul: his life was Christ, and his death was gain. Observe, 1. It is the undoubted character of every good Christian that to him to live is Christ. The glory of Christ ought to be the end of our life, the grace of Christ the principle of our life, and the word of Christ the rule of it. The Christian life is derived from Christ, and directed to him. He is the principle, rule, and end of it. 2. All those to whom to live is Christ to them to die will be gain: it is great gain, a present gain, everlasting gain. Death is a great loss to a carnal worldly man; for he loses all his comforts and all his hopes: but to a good Christian it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery and the perfection of his comforts and accomplishment of his hopes; it delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to the possession of the chief good. Or, To me to die is gain; that is, to the gospel as well as to myself, which will receive a further confirmation by the seal of my blood, as it had before by the labours of my life. So Christ would be magnified by his death, Phi_1:20. Some read the whole expression thus: To me, living and dying, Christ is gain; that is, I desire no more, neither while I live nor when I die, but to win Christ and be found in him. It might be thought, if death were gain to him, he would be weary of life, and impatient for death.     May God bless you as you study His Word    |`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well, when you are actually dying you'd better believe it.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	That has to be one of the worst-written quotes EVER. "To live is Christ"? That makes about as much sense as saying "To live is uncle Mortimer".|`|58jwkbbSaa	Gain, because I will be in Heaven where there is no pain.|`|d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	It's a win-win situation with Jesus Christ.  I have Him now, and I will have Him forever; because He has me.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Paul did not fear death. As with others who have fought the good fight and overcome the world, he desired to be relieved of the burdens of mortality and rest in the paradise of God; yet his sense of duty caused him to know his ministry here was not over, that though his own salvation was assured, he must remain in the flesh and work further for the salvation of his fellow saints.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Out of this body and in the Spirit we can gloify the Lord much better!|`|kDzaQC9waa	death is definately a gain|`|yzRHAWNhaa	Death is Gain and a loss. You gain everything in paradise and you lose all your pain, anguish and mental cruelty the planet of the apes specializes in.   PRAISE JESUS ? ? ? ?|`|xo4iux9gaa	Gain because I will be with Jesus....and all suffering and pain will cease.    Good Scripture by the way....    God bless.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I think you should read that chapter in it's entirety.  It is actually quite beautiful.    Life is wonderful.  But, death can be also.  Everyone knows people who have been so sick that death brings peace for them.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	for those who are born again death is the beginning of paradise!!! HUGE GAINS FOR US|`|wuPTBIIuaa	if you take into account what one preacher said a couple of weeks ago! That no one has actually died since the resurrection. than death is a gain.   but if you take into consideration that if a sinner dies without atonement , that they go to hell, death is a loss.     so IN CHRIST to die is to Gain.    but the other half of this conversation and subject is that It is also JuST as Good to live despite tribulation and sacrifice ones life for the edification of the church to be their teacher and suffer the "arrows" and magic missiles that come our way.
o0I5YXMNaa	And food police can enter your home and look in your fridge to see if you are eating correctly......and microchipped fridges that can report what's in there?     It's not far away....|`|iybezfi6aa	Heck, we probably have it good now. In the future we will probably be micro-chiped at birth with a tracking device. Think it can't happen?|`|hsyI1DxDaa	"I for one am considering moving to a desolate mountain somewhere, if you havent got privacy in your own home then what do you have?"<br>  <br>  Oh, me too, I just want to be a hermit on a island or something, this crap is ridiculous.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I'm concerned but at the moment there is little we can do but try not to put to much information on the internet or other places about yourself.  But it is almost impossible not too.  If you want to save money at the store, then you have to do your card through the machine (Safeway card).  They know what you eat, about how much you eat, and how you eat.  Then you have to have a Costco card to even get that discount.  You have Credit Cards that they give you and they know your spending habits, but who wants to keep a lot of cash on them these days?|`|PD3qATQtaa	I don't think there doing it on a mass scale currently but it certainly something they can do. All those applications you harmlessly add on facebook normally contain disclaimers saying they gather your person all information and with laws coming into place for ISP to regulate and monitor there users its certainly something people should be more aware of.|`|TyI0jbcqaa	If it gets worse I'll be on the mountain next to yours.|`|70a47f94503a1953542e060626fbb52caa	This is a very believable theories and I would not be surprised, if we find out in 20 years time, that we are being watched in our own home. Don't forget the government wanted us to have papers with our names and address and DNA on it, in order to combat the problems of  illegal immigrants. They can now read our email, text messages and listen to our phone conversations. They even know where we go because of the sat nav Technology. Scary if you deeply think about it!!|`|NtodRnoUaa	yes I am concerned. But most people are too busy or ignorant to realise that all their basic rights are slowly being sneaked away. We are becoming a nation like that of Orwells 1984. If you haven't read it please do it will really open your eyes.
GGGmoyNeaa	I'm sick of him clogging up questions,and blocking and reporting has no effect as he just keeps coming back<br>  <br>  My questions don't even post anymore and he gets away with that nonsense. It sickens me.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	You know what?  He does not bother me.  He cuts and pastes a lot about his beliefs, but at least he's not promoting homophobia then screaming "intolerance" when others complain.  As long as it is not harming anyone, I say let him post.  No one has to read it if they don't want to.|`|80JBvRdFaa	If it really bothers you vote him down. I'm sure others are doing the same.|`|kksq9BtOaa	Just ignore him.|`|5MVQrmMfaa	He's short a few bricks....seriously, he's not a "regular" mormon.  None of what he has written makes much sense.|`|DeF8Ir5naa	You must be a mormonspammerist - shame on you!<br>  <br>  For real, that guy is quite annoying.|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	To many mormons on this site harvesting the weak, just like all cults.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	It's the holy spirit of R&S at work dear, and he works in mysterious ways.... (deep voice, eyes rolling)
e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	No.  That's a common fallacy in logical thinking:  the all or nothing fallacy.    The Bible is full of stories, allegories, poems, etc.  None of them were written to be read literally.    Jesus came and said He was giving us one salient commandment:  to love one another.    If you use that as a touchstone when reading the Bible, you'll have a pretty good idea of what should be taken literally and what shouldn't.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Its all God's Word.|`|06Z3fh4laa	As a matter of fact, it does. If you're going to claim parts are true, then admit others aren't and not provide any evidence some are real and some aren't, then logically, one would assume it's all false.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	Jesus quoted from most major books of the Old Testament.  So clearly Jesus believed they were true.  If Jesus were God, he would know if they were true or not.     So either they are true, or Jesus is not God.    That's my take.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Well, look at it like this...people who discount some of it have a very, very high tendance to discount all of it.     There are, of course, parables and such, but they are always identified as such.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It does but do you know what 'true' means.    I've got the book right in front of me. Aristotle's On Interpretation and the Bible.   "Thus a prayer is a sentence, but is neither true nor false"  Now that immediately eliminates the most popular and largest books of the Bible. Psalms, Song of Songs for instance.    Then the question becomes, Is this a book that even can be considered as true/false ?    See the problem.     What is capable of being true must be true but that just moves the question back.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	No - since the evidence says the story of Jesus is untrue!!    There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no but they are cuz HE INSPIRED ALL OF IT.|`|FpMS47sXaa	nope.      Jesus' message is the whole friggin point. Not the stories passed down from generation to generation by the oral tradition.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	No, some are slivers of what was written, added to and changed by men who didn't like what that alluded to or said about a race or culture of family.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Yes, though Jewish believe Job never existed but I believe he really existed..........the Story of Job is not a parable but that man really existed|`|AA11703455	If I am betting my life on Jesus, then I would expect that everything he taught to be the truth was such. And so it follows that every account in the Bible is true.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	No, so it's a good job there are many stories in scripture that are plainly invented.  Sometimes this is quite obvious: Jonah, for example.  The Burning Fiery Furnace?  Elijah and the soggy sacrifice that caught fire? Noah's ark?  Come on, let's exercise just a little discernment around here.|`|AA12194228	No, but there is truth at the core.|`|qCtbizzPaa	Yes, it does.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Apparently.|`|XqpRYh52aa	The bible is allegedly gods word,so yes,it does.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	Well does the Three little pigs, or Little Red Riding hood have to be true for it's message to be true?|`|QQbBM77Jaa	Yes.|`|CBUPymktaa	why not .. i assume theyre all true ..|`|xBGEcPvCaa	i dont know but Christians dont compromise, if you can take away one part then you can take away the rest that doesnt sit well with you|`|pxgIsS0Maa	When correctly interpretted, yes.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	Considering there are books of poetry and aphorisms, no.|`|b6rBHPMlaa	Religiously true, yes. Historically or scientifically true? No.|`|swvjPuiFaa	Yes. It has changed peoples lives. I recommend you read it and ask god to speak to you through it. Hope this helps:)|`|wM7pprr1aa	Would you accept a history book as true if it stated things about historical events that are obviously untrue?    If a history book stated that WWII never happened, would you take it's account of the Australian American War (1977-1979) seriously?    No, of course not, a book which purports itself to show fact must consistently show fact, or it throws all it's statements to be suspect, including Jesus' divinity.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	No.  The validity of Jesus' story does not hinge on whether there actually was a talking donkey 1000 years earlier.|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	I don't believe so. The Bible was still put together by man. Only 66 books choosen by King James. Alos, back in the day, there were no copy machines so people had to rewrite copys of the bible by hand... a tedious process.    Also, I don't think Job is literal, because the book is too long, outlining every thoughts of Job. Also, revelation was writen by John sentanced to years, alone on an island.     History shows Jesus was a real person. That much we can believe.|`|sGojEWOxaa	Some stories in the bible are just that - stories.  There are some that are called parables.  But we are instructed to believe that every word in the bible is true.  So if you believe in Jesus, you will believe in the rest of the bible.  Psalm 119:160  Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  John 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.|`|8OpFYoO4aa	A large portion of the Holy Bible is a record of the genealogy of Christ, who fulfills the prophesy of Genesis 3:15, that begins with Seth. (Gen. 5:3) And shows the works of Satan to break-up the line of the promised seed.|`|kDzaQC9waa	...it does help in the inerrant factor, yes.|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	If you read something that was based on a true story and found out that there was one fact that was not true, how would you be able to believe the rest of the story to be true also? Would you question the validity of the rest of the story?  God can't tell you part of the truth and lie about the rest of it and expect you to believe it and still find true salvation and have in Jesus.   God would be asking you to put your trust in a lie.  God has given enough proof and encouragement through bible prophecy that the Bible is true cover to cover and there is no lies or false statements in it.|`|zAih0Vx5aa	Yes. Absolutely.    The feeding 5000 using limited resources, the coming back to life, the walking on water, the 40 days and 40 nights in the desert, the healing the sick, the forgiving those who were really nasty to Him, the not walking on the other side, everything.    If there was one lie in the Bible (and I am certain that there is not) then the whole Bible could be called into question. I get very annoyed by those who say "It's all about interpretation".

rV1uAtt3aa	As Stuart said, it's human nature.  The big problem with revenge, as I see it, is that people can imagine all kinds of wrongs.

It was next to the hospital so we thought it might have been some sort of clinic in the past.<br>  <br>  Some mornings when I woke up I smelt strange smells, like antiseptic.  One morning I woke up to a little girl's voice saying my name and giggling.  Doors would always open and close on their own.  My housemate said he saw a little girl standing in the doorway for a second looking at him.  <br>  <br>  I'm usually uneasy in the dark, but in this house I was freaked out!

Satin is a defeated enemy of yours and you chose to serve him.

Once the transaction takes place, you would have NO real say in who or what takes plce there. You would ex[ect your son to use good judgment. Especially if you told him to stay away from ONE tree that was outside his property.<br>       Then you see he let in some very bad people. What could you do now.You would have no legal right to take the house back and kick the criminals out. Your son had given them legal residence.Now your son is in a bind. He sees what he did.All through m,an's history all God could do is what he was legally given permission to do. Power of attorney, if you will. He made covenants with Abraham and the other prophets. That gave Him rights to bless them. But if anyone thumbed their nose at him. he would just sit back and let their lives play out.That is all He can do.<br>      God does not know the future, he creates the future. Just like you create your destiny.Adam created the future for all mankind. Eternal damnation. God saw he needed a savior for man, so, he started speaking and creating.He said in the garden of Eden, " I will send one to put his foot on your head " to the devil. Then for 4000 years He speaks covenants and is creating Jesus. When the picture of Jesus was complete, He became flesh and dwelt among men.<br>      Now God has created a different future for you and all mankind in Jesus. But if YOU CHOOSE to ignore Him, then YOU will stay on the destiny Adam put you on.And that decision YOU will have to live with. Even though throughout eternity you will still be blaming God for being mean to you.YOU reject His love, and he is the bad guy, go figure.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	There was no suffering PRIOR to the fall.

God 'declares the end from the beginning' (Is.46:10) because he lives outside of time, in eternity.<br>  <br>  Yes, a loving God did create a creation that would suffer, for, whilst suffering is something that we think is the worst thing that can happen to a person, that is not God's opinion.  No, to be eternally lost and to suffer eternally is the worst thing, for our present suffering only lasts while we live, but suffering beyond that never ends.<br>  <br>  As you say, God did not start the suffering, but man did, out of his own choice to disobey the express commands of God.  Now, why did God make people like that, who he knew would disobey him and bring suffering on themselves?  Well, good question.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, if you believe in angels, you will see that it was the same way with them.  God made the angels before us, and he gave them free will.  He did not make a race of robots, pre-programmed to love and obey him, because that wouldn't be true love and true obedience, would it?  You see, these things are bought at a price.<br>  <br>  Not only that, within the Godhead, those three Persons of the Trinity behave in the same way to one another - they also love, respect and obey willingly, because they have chosen this way.  So, God made the angels, and he made us, according to the same pattern - he wanted creatures who were, in a sense, going to follow the same principle which runs throughout the inter-relationships within the Godhead.<br>  <br>  That's what he chose, whether we like it or not, because he wanted to come out of this whole thing two sets of beings - both angels and men - who would love him and serve him willingly, because they choose, their wills being free, just as in the Godhead.  God could've made robots, but he chose something better.<br>  <br>  So, suffering is what we pay for having free will.  Think about it, it is so in the world, too, isn't it?  For whenever a person stands up for what is right - the right to speak his mind and give an opinion, the right to defend the poor and underprivileged, the right to worship who and what he chooses - doesn't he generally have to pay for it?  Yes, if his personal rights, no matter how valid they are, go against the government or the societal laws where he lives, he will have to pay for his exercise of his free will, with his life or imprisonment.<br>  <br>  Now, in order to have a choice, there must be a right way and at least one alternative (ie. a wrong way), and if there were just a right way and no alternative, then there would be no choice available.  Therefore, man would be at a kind of 'baby' stage, innocent of everything that was 'out there' (which God knows, but he does not).  Not really a fitting companion for God, eh?  For a fitting companion for God must know as he knows and that's why Adam and Eve had a choice.  To give them no choice (and no tree to tempt them) would have been to keep them in innocence forever.<br>  <br>  These things are deep things and it's like unpeeling another layer of an onion, trying to explain, because there's always another level, because we are going to the very heart of why God made us as we are and to explain that we have to get very much closer to God than we are right now.  Because - properly speaking - God does not have to explain himself, but he will choose to explain these things to his friends:<br>  <br>  Joh 15:15  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>  <br>  When the Lord Jesus gave specific details in ch.24 of Matthew in what is known as the Olivet discourse, of what would happen at the end of the age, just before his return to earth, he spoke of many sufferings and disasters to come.  He called these 'the beginning of sorrows' - comparing them to the birth pangs of a woman in labour, leading on to the greatest pain just before the child is born.<br>  <br>  Now, he was concerned for mankind - he wept over Jerusalem, for he foresaw her destruction and her sufferings to come, fulfilled in AD70 - for no one ever loved his own, and all people in fact, as he did.  But he knew that these things must be (Matt.24:6) and told us not to be troubled (ie. in fear), for the eternal plan, even in these things, was being fulfilled.<br>  <br>  I am still being a bit cryptic, but understand that it is a matter of what best can be described as 'cosmic war carried out by unseen forces' - ie. spiritual forces of good and evil, with us in the middle, the 'prey' if you like.  For the evil one is after a 'prey' and God is also after his people, too.  <br>  <br>  We, in the middle of this, must, just as in the Garden of Eden, choose whom we will follow.  And, just as in any war, suffering is one of the effects, and casualties.  We knew that when we pursued World War II, that if we hadn't gone to war with Hitler, we'd all be speaking German by now (sorry Germans) and been saying 'Heil Hitler!'.<br>  <br>  You see, freedom is more important than suffering, it is so infinitely precious.|`|OyOQES3paa	i know the future!!! in a minute im gonna eat some licorice!!! <br>  <br>  ps i dont believe in god......

jmV009Kiaa	If you are born in Italy, depending on the stauts of the immigration in that country, you would be Italian of Irish origin. That is what we in the U.S have because whoever is born here automatically becomes a U.S. Citizen and therfore American of whatever ancestrial origin. You would say I am an American my parents originally from Ireland. Or I am a first generation American. Find out what immigration status Itlay has. Some places in the world will not accept you as an American does though you are born in that country. That is the difference. Hope you understood. You may marry someone who is not of the same country origin so it may not apply to your kids. If you marry an Italian your children will be Italians still depending in the nature of the immigration status of the country. In American its just American thro and thro.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	If you are born in Italy then you would be Italian with Irish decent. If your kids were born in the US, then they would be American with Italian and Irish decent.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	No. You would ethnically be Irish, and that is based on genes.  The rules of biology and genetics dictate that.     What you legally would be would be different, and depends on the laws of Italy and Ireland, and the legal status of your parents there.    I believe in most "western" nations, a person born in a particular country is generally considered a citizen, but maybe not a natural citizen.|`|t3w3cDduaa	You would be Irish Italian.  Like people from Nigeria born in America are Nigerian American.
