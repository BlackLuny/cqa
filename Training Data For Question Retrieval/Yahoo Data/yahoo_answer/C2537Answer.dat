gEw83TRTaa	No.  You call the DMV for Miami, FL and explain the situation.  You will need to talk to someone in professional licensing department.  Also, you may want to call someone in the title records department. They will advise you of the next steps.    It is likely that someone bought all the old finance paper.  So you may be contacted soon by a bank, dealer, or finance comapny that has assumed the account.  If that does not happen, the guy simply closed up shop and is in the wind.    If you have your paperwork from the sale, proof of payments made, and a bill of sale, you may get lucky and get the state to issue you title to the car.  this may be one of those times you went to a BHPH lot, and have actually bought the car for what its worth.  Cross your fingers and call the DMV|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Contact the Florida DMV...they're pretty good at fixing stuff like this. Good luck.|`|c7YlgvD5aa	mr trav   I don't know how you got your title, that's a different question. A few things could have happened. The dealer could have just forwarded his mail to home. The dealer could have sold your balance to a Financial Institution for .50 cents on the dollar or close and they are cashing your checks. Or someone has moved into the location and is cashing your checks. If you stop making your payments someone could repo your car. Legally or not that could happen. Even if your in Virginia. I would hire a lawyer in Fla or call the sec of state office and tell them you want to call the used car or vehicle board. Or call the office of consumer affairs. You probably owe someone for your car note. If I were the dealer I would have gotten a duplicate title that make yours worthless. Also look at the back of your checks. Good Luck  bs
eqLFfXfyaa	You'll need your insurance card as well.       Welcome to NC!|`|4tWbC3GPaa	Take the title and the reg. form signed by the lady.  along with all your id proof.    Take cheque book or credit card to pay for the sales tax..i guess you will be all set.
oiW7wZkuaa	Replace the O2 sensor and also the catalytic converter ...I'd also spring for a new muffler if the thing looks questionable.  O2 sensor is a primary input to the engine computer controlling the fuel/air mixture. Also, if your cat converter is plugged (or just fallen apart inside) this will cause a severe restriction in exhaust flow (as will a muffler).    What do you mean by your check engine light "died"? Is the bulb bad? ...if so, replace it so you can get any codes. Another way to get the codes is to use the diagnostic computer connection in the engine compartment ....you can connect a multi meter (volt/ohm) and read the needle swings. Get a copy of a shop manual (Chilton's ...used ...borrow one from the library) and it will show you the exact steps needed to trigger the codes using the diagnostic socket.    Finally, the poor thing has 224K on it ....engines don't last forever and no amout of parts replacing will revive an engine that's just flat worn out.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	yea, bad o2 sensor can cause bad millage. that is a pretty significant drop.    cat converter area is a good place to start looking.|`|Dvf3cPshaa	You should defenitely figure out how to pull codes or why you can't.  This will lead you in the right direction.  Just about any sensor on it can cause it to run rich.  You didn't mention any basic tuneup parts like plugs or wires.  Other problem see on these alot is fuel pressure regulator leaks through the vacuum line attached to them.   Just adds extra fuel to the engine.|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	A lot can happen to an engine in 50,000mi. especially if it's that high of miles, you could also look at, the muffler, the cat, the injectors, check the fuel pressure, fan clutch, O2 sensor, do a tune up and fix the engine light.

YvjTJPEfaa	It might be the battery, the radio and lights will work even if the battery is too low to crank the engine (radio is usually on a 5-10A fuse the starter motor can drain well over 100A).

A 3 year old battery should still be okay unless you live somewhere hot, in which case the battery can age prematurely.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	are the plugs getting spark? what about the fuel? maybe the gas filter needs changing.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	is fuel atleast going to the engine? check fuel filter      if it cranks normally, the battery probably isn't your problem.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Seems you had found the kill switch.|`|X6C6kZKKaa	check your fuses.

r5K5KgLpaa	First, you need to locate a drivers education course - either classroom (4 days)   or an online course.  Most new teens are opting to take the online course.  HOWEVER ~ while the course content online is good, it's very general and generic in nature.  It will not suffice for passing the DMV permit test.    Classroom courses are better if you can locate a class in your area.  Upon completing either classroom or online, you'll receive a Certificate of Completion (very important.)    Second, find a quality driving school you want to do your Behind-the-wheel lessons with.  Choose carefully, as this is the expensive part of Driver Training.  You MUST pre-enroll PRIOR to taking your permit test at the DMV.  You'll receive a Certificate of ENROLLMENT (different from 1st certificate.)  You MUST have BOTH certs. when you go to take your permit test.  You may go at 15 1/2 yrs. or older.   Also READ the DMV handbook BEFORE taking your permit test.  You'll have  a much better chance of passing the test.  Many teens are not reading the handbook and failing the permit test.  The online course is not enough to pass the test.  Good luck!
t49AF3y3aa	Yes, the cold air will effect your tire pressure just like the hot air in the summer time.   You should have them checked out and aired up.    Ask a tire dealer about the new stuff they put in tires now, it is better for tires, but it does cost you a little.|`|VOBYD2ZBaa	yes. plain and simple. if you are checking the air pressure in your tires the best time to check it is when they are cold. when it is cold the air molecules slow down and aren't expanded all the way. it like a basketball that you keep in your garage. if you get it out in the morning you notice its kinda flat then as you bounce it you see that its getting fuller and fuller. the more the air bounces around the more they expand giving you "more" air (when really all it is is the air being pushed further apart)|`|qUD3Kn1Eaa	im not totally sure, but in the cold weather, the air inside the tires will come toegether more, causing the pressure to be low. opposed to when it is hot out, the molecules move around more, making the pressure higher|`|7Vj0vaSyaa	of course! All materials expand in different weather conditions and your Tyre's are no different. Also depending on the heat depends how "active" the particles of air are inside the tyre...this will give different tyre pressures to what "normal" conditions would give
7Vj0vaSyaa	lol..idle problems will not damage your car, the worst that can happen is that you will stall and have trouble starting again (maybe not able to start). Depending on what make and model of car you have depends what you can do. The main thing is the idle control valve (an adjustable screw on older cars). By adjusting this valve, thie idle timing will change on your vehicle.     there are also a number of other problems if your car has idle problems. There could be a faulty sensor somewhere or even that you have a dirty throttle body|`|DF1JSIqWaa	idle high or low? if its idling high and you shut it off if it boggs (shakes violently and makes a lot of very unatractive noise) then its going to damage your engine heavily especialy if its an older car....try a fuel system cleaning and maybe have your intake cleaned...could be a clogged fuel rail or a bad throttle cable..
dVQdswtTaa	You should really get a manual for this, Haynes or Chilton's. While it's not mechanically complicated, it is easy to break something or even injure or kill yourself.        The truck has to be supported safely.The engine will need to be supported, and the transmission lowered safely. A transmission jack that can be secured to the transmission is best, since dropping a transmission on your head makes for a really bad day.|`|nAK8bm91aa	W/out a tranny jack, you could lose your life if not your arm or leg.|`|DF1JSIqWaa	not sure if there is a site but to do it you need a lot of tools and you need to drop a lot of extras...transfer case will come down center drive shaft will be disconnected the transmission for those is not very fun to play around with...the pan comes off very easy its like 10 13-15mm bolts be careful though...those snap VERY easily
t49AF3y3aa	If you have dual exaust on it that would be fine for now.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	Yes. after you save some money.
r5K5KgLpaa	STAY OFF ROADS and use private property only until you have your permit.  Private property might include - rural roads, church, bowling alley or motor vehicle parking lots.  Also school parking lots, IF large enough.    If you hit something and don't have a permit, your (parents) insurance might be cancelled.  You NEVER want to have your insurance cancelled.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Exactly what you think will happen.    You won't be able to get your permit on time, because your driving privileges will get suspended.    Dad in the car or not, you're operating a car without a license.    There's no exemption for that.|`|JsffWlnEaa	you wont be able to get your license until your 18
r1D9P4Vyaa	First tell them, There Is No Insurance on it. If they have FULL COVERAGE insurance on there car there insurance would cover it.  Yes let them drive it. I would never bye a car with out doing so. But when i sell a car the best thing to do is ask them to hold there drivers license, then you have there full name, address, picture Etc. All Legitimate people are glad to do so. I hope this will out some, Good Luck on the sale!|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Only an idiot would a used car without driving it first. You have to let them drive it. Keep insurance on it until you transfer ownership.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	you should let them drive it yes just ask to hold something  like their car keys or id|`|flkVehA9aa	You should keep insurance on the car as long as you own it.  It does not matter that you are trying to sell it, you still need to have insurance on it.    I have sold a couple of cars and always let the potential buyers drive them.  I don't think anyone would want to buy a car that they had not driven.  There is risk involved in selling a car yourself.  The reward is you get more money.  If you don't want that risk then sell it to a used car dealer.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	You have to let them take a test drive if you expect to sell it, but it's perfectly acceptable to ride along with them and tell them exactly where to go, just like at a dealership.
BgwTxzEFaa	Regardless of whether is gelled or not, the glowplug should come on.  IF your glowplug is not working, it is not because of gelled diesel.      If you are living in an area where it gets cold enough for gelling to occur, the fuel is usually already winterized and an additive has been added at the refinery.|`|AA11273149	probably your glow plugs are not coming on. Most diesel is sold treated for cold weather, not like the old days when you had to buy a bottle of treatment everytime the weather got cold.
Gn0nR2S1aa	Aftermarket or factory installed?
c48nm70gaa	A backfire usually points to a lean fuel /air mixture caused by a vacuum leak, plugged fuel injector nozzles, plugged fuel filter or low fuel pump pressure.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the fuel mixture wrong can make it backfire. if the timing chain jumped that can do it.|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	timing off|`|QCkanmR9aa	Ok  listen up.email me the code it should start with a p then 4 numbers I think it would be P0440 OR P0442.  Take your car to auto zone and ask them to hook up the OBD 11 computer and ask them to read the code/s they will tell you what it is and what parts you need.If you just get a code i can translate the code to the problem.I have the best system on codes so email me if you need more.I know that it goes on and off but now days you have to read it with the OBD 11 computer.so get over to auto zone tell them to read the code and ask them to clear it for you also if you like.I just had the check engine light on and i had a small vapor leak and believe me i read the code and it was air getting to my gas tank because when i pump gas i leave the car running.Cleared the code bought a new gas cap and shut car off when fulling no more problems.|`|uFQFRdczaa	If the car backfires, that means gas is exploding in the exhaust manifold and not in the cylinder where it belongs.  If it's kind of clunking that's probably an engine miss.    That plus a code for a large leak says you have a large vacuum leak.  The vacuum leak throws off your fuel/air mix, makes it impossible to burn completely.  Your car's computer is trying to compensate, but it's relying on bad information.  This can get your fuel/air mix even further off, which is why you have a miss and sometimes backfire.    Most likely a vacuum hose is off somewhere, or split open, or the intake manifold gasket has blown.  If you look under the hood with the engine running, you can probably hear a hissing noise.  A piece of hose in your ear can help you find where it's coming from.  Find the leak, fix the leak, and you're on your way.    PCV valve gone bad, probably not.  PCV valve broken off or completely missing, possibly.  PCV hose ruptured is more likely.
hMkb7H31aa	Obviously, there would be a savings.      However, many states require the front plate to better identify vehicles, i.e., camera equipped intersections for running red lights.  Also, there are other situations when only the front plate is visible and positive vehicle registration and ownership are required.

AA11435704	If the engine has been sitting for three years. It is very possible that the rings have rusted to the cylinders. Start by removing the spark plugs. Squirt some oil into each cylinder.     Take a socket that will fit the harmonic balancer bolt, and a large breaker bar. Gently turn the engine over, forward and back, until it seems to free up.     Once it is freed up, squirt some more oil into each cylinder, and try the starter without the plugs in.once it is turning over, then install the plugs and see if it will start. You may find that the gas has gone bad also, so the engine may be hard to start run poorly.|`|f444b157589dec9f85488a2adcc1f1e0aa	Remove ALL the spark plugs.  Squirt wd40 or some light oil in each cylinder.  Try to turn the engine again.    There may be some water in the cylinders.
xirQ0OtFaa	carinsurance.enacre.net - try this one. I have their car insurance and, as I know, they can provide such a service.|`|rutRnUj0aa	For car insurance the obvious way to get a low rate is do a rate comparison on auto policies. Make sure that you pick similar options with the same deductibles, car make, location, etc so that all options are a good comparison.    What I always recommend is an internet comparison quote at http://www.InsureAutoNow.info since they have top name insurers and can give multiple quotes on auto insurance polices.
E7e0Ur3Uaa	They are quite different vehicles. Chevy came out with a completely revamped Malibu in '04. However, they kept making the old style up to and including '05, but they called these Classics, or sometimes they're referred to as Malibu Classics. They continued to make the Classics for fleet purposes (rental car companies, etc.) The new style Malibu is a better vehicle by leaps and bounds in every way, and I would seriously discourage anyone from buying the old style/Classics as they are utter junk.  Best way to know is, the fourth digit of the vin will be an "N" if it's a Classic, and "Z" if it's a Malibu.|`|JLayHNZCaa	The other post is incorrect in their assessment of the older body style Malibu.  We have a 98 with over 150,000 miles, it has had very little in repairs and still runs and drives great.  A little over a year ago we upgraded with a used 2004 Classic which is basically the old body style Malibu.  It has been great so far, great mileage, drives great.  I would recommend any of the Malibus to anyone, they are roomy, powerful, ride great, keep their value.  There have been several years of Classics, in Malibus and Silverados.  Lately the 04 and 05 had a Malibu Classic.  They were made mainly for fleets, so they needed to be durable and dependable, and the one we have has been.

o9lQrcsYaa	You should be able to get another car from a different place just fine.     If you do get your car back, and you end up trading it in before you loan in paid off, BE CAREFUL, make sure your dad is with you and you understand all the paperwork, because I tried that with my Jeep, Had about 9 more months left on my current loan, and I went to a place that will pay your existing loan off, and give you a trade in value, Well all they did was give my like $3500 for my Jeep, tacked that onto a newly drawn up lease, to make my total $9900, and gave me a credit for $36.00. So basicly I was only getting 36 dollars on a trade in and they tacked the amount they paid on my Jeep onto the car I was looking at buying. I still have my Jeep to this day.    So be very careful when dealing with Buy Here/ Pay Here.|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	It won't go on your credit report for like 30 days so go now if you are trying to buy another car!|`|bW931jBaaa	"I mean, I held up my end up the bargain" You did not hold up your end if you defaulted on a payment. A late payment or non payment is not holding up your end. Let them keep your car and auction it off.

Hopefully your Dad can help you out.|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	basicly you were ripped off from the get go when you brought the car, and they were bating you in for the kill when you got so far down the line and started making payments and they saw most of their money you paid them they started plotting on getting more by not letting you make the paymant and then repoing the car , then selling it at the auction and then getting you some more for what the auction didnt pay which means they will be done made tripple the amount of the car worth, and look at this, they run and own the auction their telling you about. they get you one way or the other, coming or going, and thatas real low to be taking advantage of peple at a time like this, but I'm sorry for you, I'm almost in the simular situation.|`|eyXunHyKaa	Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|WxmNSxNGaa	The best thing to do is go ahead and pay the $396 and $100 to get the car back and get current, then continue to make your payments ON TIME. You got screwed on the whole deal, but you made your bed, you need to deal with it. $100 isn't the end of the world to get out of this situation, you're going to get screwed out of a lot more than that in your life, especially when dealing with your current and future cars (just wait until you need some major repairs. $100 will be a drop in the bucket).     Don't just let it go. You're way to young to be ruining your credit on principle. Pay your bills, finish school, then go get a good job with that degree you're working on. Don't put yourself in a back situation before your life even gets going.
r1D9P4Vyaa	What you are seeing is condensation from the beginning of the coolant of the coolant leak. It is a very small leak right now. This is why the coolant does not look like it is going down yet. What is causing the mayo at the top of the stick is the small amount of water vapor in the oil is condensing on the Cool part, (the top of the dip stick) of the oil compartment. So keep a very close Eye on the oil at the bottom part of the stick! ( the add-full lines )When that starts to get mayo looking bring it in right away to prevent any engine damage. This is what you are seeing. I hope this explains better what you are asking. Good Luck!!|`|T6d1NOwMaa	sounds like the head gasket is shot.

As a matter of fact they don't have cylinder heads because they don't have cylinders or pistons... or valves, camshafts, etc.  So therefore it's not a blown head gasket.     G-man 1 is absolutely correct. The "cream" is caused by condensation and this is why it goes away once the motor warms up. This is quite normal for a rotary engine and is nothing to worry about.|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	You just have to replace the motor oil often, it is condensation.  Water and oil just don't mix together very well.
Dv0LwrTIaa	Hi prob the easiest way to do this is to buy an active sub( has its own amp) and use a feed from your rear speakers (make sure the active sub has hi level inputs) ideally you would connect subs using low level inputs (rca's) but im not sure if the factory unit has these (most don't)  would also help if the sub has a external sub level control, this will allow you to control the amount of base you require as you will not be able to do this from the head unit.  by doing this you wont be able to achieve the same volume levels as normal as the feed to the rear speakers will now be shared.  ultimately i would consider upgrading the head unit to allow for proper sub woofer connection, but this way will work.  hope this helps, cheers.|`|dRozk0cCaa	you'll need an amp, amp kit and an rca converter since your stock radio doesn't come with rca outputs.|`|IYq1AsBXaa	You will wire the subs into the amp then take the power for the amp to the battery, and the RCA's to the back of the head unit(stock stereo). I have never bought a converter to use my stock radio before, I find that it is easier and more practical to just buy a new head unit if you are putting in sub's, This is because a stock unit does not allow you to control the sub's individually and you will not get the most out of them with out a unit that can control them. If you have the money I just recently purchased a pioneer avic f90bt, and it has made my stock subs and speakers sound amazing. Anyway get what he already told you and you should be in buisness.
HVQFVtelaa	If you are talking about wires on the factory plug off your original radio, best bet is to go to your chevy dealership, see the parts manager, he will pull down his shop manual (big dealership variety) and show you the diagram.|`|f349a8a84f3da84a716aa0eb53c91af1aa	What kind of vehicle?

Bl9zcqxQaa	A lot of different things can cause that problem, rather then guessing and putting part after part on the car trying to repair it, pay a good technician to properly diagnosis it for you.  If I had to guess, the most common problem we see on that vehicle this time of year is the DIS coil pack.   They are common for a weak spark condition when damp and cold, causing the engine not to start.    Good luck|`|AA11273149	I had one that did that but it didn't have anything to do with the temperature. It was the diode in the key not allowing the ignition security release.
r1D9P4Vyaa	Yes if the ABS light is on. It is usually one up front, from turning back and forth the sensor wires can break after time. You will need a scanner to see the code the ECU has stored and then can see what all of them are doing. this code & abs light comes on when the ECU see`s one wheel is at a different speed then the others at speeds above about 45 mph. I hope this helps to answer your question some. The ABS will not work with the light on, the computer will disable it. You will just have normal braking, no anti-lock.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	Do you *KNOW* that your vehicle has *more* than *one* speed sensor?  Does your dashboard control panel have *more* than one speedometer?

Or a lot.    There's so many different variables, it's not even worth really answering this question.    How much HP? At what PSI? With what other mods? What octane? What fuel control?     It's not like you buy a turbo and it magically provides a specific number. You can seriously bolt it up, and have it provide absolutely zero gain.    By the way, you want TORQUE. Horsepower is an imaginary number created for advertising.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower    Torque is the physical force that actually moves your car.    Ignore Jase, by the way. He often posts entirely wrong answers.    Horsepower is a number that is calculated, using torque as a base. Without torque, there is no horsepower. So, American, Japanese, European, or any other type of car...if you want horsepower, you need torque.

7YE2arJWaa	Falcon 4.0 has always been one of the more faithful flight simulators ever developed.  The last version, Falcon 4.0 Allied Force, is still available:  http://www.amazon.com/Falcon-4-0-Allied-...    $23 for a sim that many real F-16 fighter pilots have said it's the closest to the real thing you can get on a PC sim.  A steal.    The learning curve for flying the F-16 in the sim is not that steep.  The learning curve for air-to-air dogfighting is a bit complex but manageable.  It's the ground-attack missions that can be a bit hard to master, and fighting as a team with your computer-controlled wingmen is a whole other level and will take months of replay to master.  There should be something in it to suit your degree of sim interest, and is a great way to spend $23.  :-)|`|H5BnOnvlaa	FlightGear (www.flightgear.org) is absolutely free.

mR5ZtjqWaa	All airplanes will eventually sink if it is in water, even pressurized planes. (more on that later) But there are several areas in the airplane that have pockets of air that help keep the plane afloat. For example, in the area between the outside skin of the fuselage and the interrior there is a space that is usually insulated and has air that needs to be displaced by the water. In most airplanes built today, the wing is the fuel tank, and since water is heavier than fuel the fuel in the wings help offset some of the weight of the plane...not a lot but some.    [the cabin itself is also buoyant until filled with water]    There is also air in the cargo hold of larger planes that will help maintain buoyancy until the air is replaced by water. Anyone who thinks an airplane is water tight and will float because it is pressurized is nuts! The airplane is pressurized only while the engines are running and the air being pumped into the aircraft to pressurize it is almost escaping the aircraft just as fast as it is being pumped in. There are control valves in the forward and rear bulkhead that regulate the pressure inside the plane but all pressure is lost if the engines quit running.    thanks to Tyler Cowen    not all planes have a "ditch mode"  and most water landings result in some sort of fuselage breakup.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	man, everyone above nailed it|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Not very well.|`|AA10611297	u never know it sometimes does and some times doesn't it all depends on the aircraft|`|RbCry06Taa	It depends on the circumstance, if its a successful water landing or ditching and that the aircraft structure remains intact then yes it can stay afloat but only on a certain period of time. Also, if the cockpit crew is able to switch on the aircraft ditch mode before the water landing then most if not all the outflow valves and ports are sealed. Thereby delaying the water intake of the aircraft and buying the crew and passengers more time.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	By design, all aircraft are built of lightweight materials.  While the ability to remain afloat is not a requirement of design, if the fuselage remains intact they are pretty likely to float.  But even a large boat won't float if you fill it with water.      *|`|dVrHELZ2aa	Not on the ocean...    Lifejackets my ***. Don't expect that river crap to happen everyday.

pRuLTF9iaa	if you changed the thermostat and water pump im sure your smart enough to check that the radiator is full of coolant (not the overflow tank)  i'm assuming that you have 50/50 mix not straight antifreeze. also, it may be something insane like the pores in your radiator clogged (not likely though).  i would first check to make sure that all hoses are clear...  then i would check and see if your fan is working. ooh.. that's a good idea... do that first. let the car idle for a while and if the fan doesn't engage then go from there. im not too sure if the fans in a lincoln continental are electric or not. if they are electric then it could be some screwy electronic deal... i hate screwy electronic deals...

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	You could not find it because there is no cabin air filter on the F-150, and it is not equipped to install one.  The air intake is under the cowl panel, next to the windshield on the passenger side, a plastic mesh dome is all that is covering it.  It could be mold on the evaporator causing the smell, the dealer can spray a fungicide into the air intake and that may get rid of the mold.  You can try it yourself actually, take a can of lysol, and with the blower running on high, spray it into the air intake on the cowl panel on the passenger side, really load it in there, might kill the mildew growing in your evaporator housing.  I have seen rodents, such as mice build nests under the cowl panels as well, and possibly die there making a smell, nothing like sticking your hand into a pile of wiggling decay, which I have done before, ugh, charged extra for that one, lol.  I would recommend removing the cowl panel on the passenger side and having a look for yourself, leaves and debris like to collect under there too, might add to smell.  If the air intake is clear, I would try the lysol, if that doesn't improve it, the dealer can add the fungicide to the evaporator box.|`|BsMkp3nPaa	it could be a dead mouse in the heater box.  but some a/c systems are prone to grow a mold that stinks like that and they make a spray to kill it and eliminate the odor.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	The drain is likely plugged and you have stagnant water in the evaporator as a result.    --------    The newer R-134a systems are more prone to developing mold problems than the previous R-12 systems. To get the same cooling, manufacturers had to pack more coils and fins into the same space. Those fins trap the condensation and bacteria and before you know it, you've got a science experiment growing in your car. To make matters worse, the mold turns into slime and clogs up the drain tube. Then you've got a toxic swimming pool. So first, you have to find the drain tube and make sure it's open and draining. Look for water puddles under your car-that means it's draining. If it isn't, you'll have to clean it out. Next, you'll have to inject a bacterial agent into the A/C case. You can use Lysol type cleaners, but they really don't do a good job over the long term. I've had pretty good luck with this product: http://www.airsept.com/index.php?loadmod... Lastly, it helps if you turn off your A/C and let the fan run for a few minutes after you've used it. That helps evaporate some of the water on the coils.

One should always be hotter than the other.    Bring it to a shop and have them do a quick block test (25-40 dollars) to make sure there is no signs of a head gasket leak. You can have a head gasket problem without any noticeable white smoke from the tail pipe and could explain your overheating problems.    Not a real common problem for Honda, but it is always a possibility.|`|jp5ZO0rMaa	you got too much pressure build up in your top radiator hose.  This is very dangerous to do yourself, so id advise you to take it to a shop.

This will squirt hot fluids out and leave burns.
c48nm70gaa	Mobil1 5W-30 synthetic oil pours @ -47 below 0 Farenheit. Cold starts weather it be Winter or Summer is where 80% of engine wear occurs. It's to your engines advantage for the oil pump to force the greatest volume of oil to critical frictional surfaces as fast as possible. Regular non-synthetic 5W-30 stops pouring completely @ -35 below 0.     Synthetic oil has a far better formulation of detergents, anti-wear properties and it volatilizes at higher temperatures. Your car manufacturer calls for 5W-30. Low viscosity synthetic oil actually cools the inside of the motor more efficiently than as if you used regular oil. The oil temperature will be lower. Synthetic oil is more slippery by nature thus you may pick up some fuel economy. Your motor will make more horsepower also as the oil pump will turn easier.    Mobil Oil has a teriffic website where all techinical aspects of synthetic and regular oil are completely covered. You'll be able to compare facts and figures between regular and full synthetic. Not many oil companies publish these comaritive facts.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	The benefits are better gas mileage and you can  double the oil change mileage plus synthetic lubricates better than conventional oil, synthetic is man made and conventional oil isn't.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	The synthetic requires less oil changes than regular oil is an advantage.

Here is the basic's about oils. Conventional oil is a natural oil that comes from the ground. Synthetic oil is a man made material. natural oil does a great job at lubricating your motor. It does however tend to break down a lot more quickly. the Lubrication properties of oil is called viscosity. As any motor oil gets hot, the viscosity rating of the oil gets less and less. There for it must be changed. With synthetic oil, It tends to break down slower, therefor the viscosity level tends to be greater for longer periods of time. Because of the fact that it takes longer to loose its "lubrication" abilities you can go more miles with less oil changes. Most conventional oils requires you to change it at 3000 miles. With synthetic oils you can go up to 7000 miles. Now remember, all this depends on your driving conditions. If you are like most, then the 7000 mile oil change is were you are at.|`|fvq4TyOvaa	Advantages of synthetic:  1. It virtually does not break down during use. This means a clean happy engine that require far less oil changes.   2. Less oil changes results in 3 other things:     a. I save money because I am changing my oil less times.     b. I save time because I have to crawl under the car fewer times.     c. I am helping to save the environment because I am contributing less waste oil and less oil filters.  3. It provides better lubrication, especially in cold weather.   4.Often times actually improves fuel mileage (I did on 2of2 of the vehicles that I own)  5. Engines run cooler (Harley air cooled engines have been documented at 40 degrees cooler)    I run Amsoil, they wrote the book on synthetic fluids, since 1972. Way before Mobil. (Mobil laughed at them for many years thinking nobody would want synthetic!)      The Amsoil oil filter is also superior in that it filters much better because of their nanofilter technology.    While you are at it, change your air filter with the Amsoil air filter. It will help save you fuel again, plus provide better air filtration... better than stock, even better than K&N (plus other expensive but not so great performing brands.)

Read the forum for 30 minutes and look at how many Craigslist scams there are.  How many people buy private party and get screwed.    The major difference is this.  A dealer has to be licensed and bonded by your state to sell cars.  There is an oversight and regulatory body.  So if there is a problem with a dealer, a case of misrepresentation, or any other problem, there is a defined process for recourse.  Buy from a private party and you are strictly on your own.    That said, yes, there are unscrupulous dealers.  That is true in cars, Real Estate, storm windows and fresh produce.

Car-to-car, eXRS works about a half mile or so. eXRS is also free from interference from idiots, since there are anywhere from 1000 to 10 billion channels depending on what models you get.

However, some rental agencies will allow one to rent a car if you're under 25, providing that you pay an additional daily surcharge. For most agencies/states, the minimum age is 21, while a few may go as low as 18. If you can rent through an employer/group plan, you may also be able to rent. If you are on official military orders, you can probably rent if over 18, but if you're just on leisure travel/leave the usual rules typically apply.    http://www.bnm.com/uage.htm a good site to help you find such agencies and compare the surcharge rates in major cities, as is http://www.autorentalguide.com/car-renta...
QxJVD1Flaa	Some replies are redicilous! I had a ranger, awesome truck!     First you mentioned your check engine light burnt out. Is it because it was on the whole time? If so, your oxygen sensor went out. If you ignore that for long enough, the catalic converter starts to get clogged up, because the sensors aren't telling the engine computer what's happening at the exhaust end. After the catalyc converter starts to clog up, you will lose power and use more and more gas with time. Let me know if this helped, or if this fits the discription of your problem.|`|SLcZatQBaa	Have you tried changing the spark plugs and plug wires?  MOST people who are not mechanically savvy and have 2.3L Rangers tend not to mess with them because of it being an 8-spark plug system running off of a coil pack.  The spark plug wire boots under the intake runners are pretty much impossible to get to without a spark plug wire boot tool that is made for these 2.3 engines.  Here's a picture.    http://forums.corral.net/photopost/data/...      The universal tool won't reach.  If the plugs have not been changed they may have excessive carbon build up, they may be starting to bridge, the plug gaps might even be opening up.    As mentioned, it is a good idea to clean the MAF sensor, BUT DO NOT USE BRAKE CLEANER, regardless if an experienced mechanic says it works for him.  Parts stores sell a cleaning spray made just for the MAF sensor made by a company called CRC.    DO NOT put that Z-MAX garbage in your motor.  Stick with the factory specified oil.  It's just a four cylinder, not a race engine and those expensive lubricants are just expensive snake oils.    Maybe the bulb for the check engine light is burned out.  You will have to undo the dash trim around the gauge cluster then remove the gauge face to change the bulbs.  REPLACE ALL THE BULBS WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.  The moron that says your computer is fried doesn't know cars very well.  If it was your truck wouldn't run at all.    Get under the truck and see if the oxygen sensor is discolored (brown or rusted).  If it is then very likely it hasn't been changed or changed at factory recommended intervals.  These sensors don't last forever.    One last thing you can try and I have seen this work.  Go to a parts store and buy a can of SEAFOAM.  Run the truck to hot operating temp.  Have someone in the truck to feather the gas pedal and turn the truck off.  Take the vacuum hose off of the brake booster with engine running.  The gas pedal needs to be feathered because you want to suck in half the can and while you're doing this the engine will want to cut out.  Once you're down to half can have the person shut off engine.  Waiy 10 to 15 minutes.  Start it back up.  It should smoke like crazy for the first couple of minutes because the Seafoam has broken up a lot of oil and carbon buildup in the intake tracts and in the cylinders.  It also loosens up or removes gunk in the idle air control valve and EGRs.  Do a video search on Youtube for SEAFOAM RANGER.  You'll see what I'm talking about.  Dump the rest of the remaining Seafoam in the tank.    Join the Ranger websites I list below.  Lots of great tech info there.|`|teAtI3Itaa	gasoline/air mixture is based on water temperature, make sure thermostat isn't stuck|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	What do you mean, it can't be due to high mileage?

There is a good writeup on this site for pulling the pan on a Cherokee.  http://www.go.jeep-xj.info/HowtoRearMain...    It is unlikely that the pan gasket is leaking however.  They seal really well from the factory.  More likely is a front or rear crankshaft seal leak. The rear requires removal of the oil pan.  The front does not.    Mike    http://mikestrawbridge.com/jeep-cherokee...|`|AA11745513	You gotta get your hands dirty. you have to drain the oil and take the oil pan off and replace the gasket. The exhaust may be in the way so you may have to drop it first. Just put new oil and filter on it when your done. Oh and make sure you properly torque the oil pan back down so it doesnt leak. It isnt a first time repair job if you havent done something like that before. If your up to it you can buy a service manual from Autozone or something with instuctions and pictures of how to do the job.

R1vZHRIDaa	Obtain as many secondary qualifications as you possibly can as secondary school is compulsory and so are the subjects your school does. While you are still at secondary school it is best and most advisable that you begin flying lessons in order to obtain your PPL license. This is the very first license you should obtain and after gaining your PPL you should continue to gain many other licenses and ratings:   Private Pilot License.  Instrument Rating;  Commercial License;  Multi-Engine license/add-on;  Certified Flight Instructor (CFI);  Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII);  Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI);  Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI).  There are quite a lot widely available. The first one you will do, PPL, you can start the lessons at a minimum age 14 years old, go solo at a minimum age 16 years old and obtain license at 17 years old. From there your instructor can advise you what to do next and from then on.  After secondary school, go on to tertiary education (Known as A-level in the UK, short for Additional Level). You can choose 4 or 5 courses to take for one year. For the second and final year you will drop one course. Preferably you want to be looking at taking Mathematics, Physics, A Language and a subject you enjoy. (If youre doing 5 subjects which is very rare choose something else useful e.g. Geography, Engineering or most of all English).  For the second year as I stated you drop one subject. It is very advised that you drop the subject you enjoy as the other subjects are your main priorities. If you gain all of these then move onto university, choose any course you like, preferably the course that you are best at as airlines don't mind which degree you have as long as you have one (However it is sometimes possible to become a pilot without a degree but is unlikely). Remember that during all these stages and levels of education continue with your flying and gaining more ratings and try to log as many hours as you possibly can. This is very important when it comes to decision time.   Airlines say that a degree isnt required, which is partly true but the competition is extremely high and candidates with a degree are head and shoulders above the candidates who dont have a degree. For university it is best that you choose to do a 4-year degree of the subject that you excel at the most. So, the subject you get best at A-Level, carry it on to degree level as airlines don't mind which degree you have obtained but as long as you have one (although a degree isn't a necessity). Or you could do a combinational degree as I did; I did Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Spanish at A-Level and carried Mathematics and Spanish on to degree level. The choice is yours on which subject to do.  Also, if you really want to become a pilot then you will be a better candidate if you have logged hours in a light aircraft. It is advisable that you log a bare minimum of 600 hours but really try to excel that target.  So, while youre still at secondary school I suggest you begin taking flying lessons to obtain a PPL (Private Pilot License). Minimum ages are:  Begin lessons: 14  Go solo: 16  Obtain license: 17  Once you have obtained this you should log as many hours as you possibly can before entering university as you will be struggling financially unless youre rich.  So by the age of 22 you could have all your GCSE's, 4 A/S levels. 3 A levels, a degree and a PPL license.  With this you are an almost perfect candidate and stand an extremely strong chance of becoming a pilot. This is the way I did it so I like to think it would help other people as well.    For training for a PPL on a Cessna 150M here are the costs:  45 hours flying C150 - 5,175  Landing fees (estimate) - 300  Training items - 175  Annual membership varies for each school but mine is 99.50  Radio-telephony test fee - 55  Total - 5,804    GROUND STUDIES:  Ground school (when required) 25 per hour  Written exams - 30 each  IMC test - 65  Radiotelephony test - 65  PPL skill test - 130  Class 2 medical examination - 140    If you want to do it in a better plane such as a Tobago TB10 then add 21 for every hour you take.    Self hire for these aircraft are approximately 95 per hour including landing fee    Class 1 Medical examination  Study books (7 books at approx $30 each)  Instrument Rating  Radiotelephony equipment and test fee  Landing fees (varies on size of airport)  Ground studies and tuition  Written examination fee  PPL Skill test  IMC test  The only clothing you need is a highly visible vest (bright green or yellow)  Membership  Total cost approx 5500  I apologize that I dont know which country your from so I cant exchange the prices myself.  The prices vary with which aircraft you learn in.|`|75e9a4cd8078fe09c3480ee503f0a03aaa	I just want to disagree with "music gu......." , there is alot of money to be made if you fly for the big airlnes   100k plus.

If you can swing it, than start by getting your private pilot license. Attend flight school to get higher ratings and possible become an instructor, or get qualified to fly commercial and look for job with small regional company or as flight instructor. There is option of starting in the military. Check out opportunities in your area in the Civil Air Patrol. The flight plan which provides you with the most options seems best way to catch favorable  winds. Hope you solo faster than hoped.|`|ruenEu8Yaa	the VERY best way to go to be an airline pilot is to go into the service (air force, army, marines, etc.) and become a pilot and you can get your flight time while you're there.  then I would go to college (why not since its gonna be practically free) to get even more time and education in.       doing this will pretty much make you am asset to any company... haha airlines will be fighting to get you...    if you go the college, then CFI route, it will probably take alot longer since flight instructors usually fly maybe (and i mean MAYBE) 3 to 5 hours a day.  and they earn poverty level wages...|`|yvPA8FSsaa	There are colleges that have programs specifically designed to make a pilot out of you.  The largest hurdle is acquiring enough hours of flying time.  Programs such as these colleges have their own aircraft and instructors.  It is easier to get flying hours in that way.    But you can start right now.  Study everything you can get your hands on.  While current aviation regulations constantly change, basic knowledge and aerodynamics does not.  There are plenty of Aviation Book clubs you can join that offer monthly book choices at reasonable prices. You find ads in aviation magazines like "Flying"  That is what I did.  When it came time to start my actual flying lessons, I already had passed my written test and often knew more about the airplane and the forces acting on it than my instructor.    They used to get a kick out of me at the FBO.  They used to love firing questions at me and more often than not, I would know the answer.  They would then razz the other instructors that did not know.    *|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Get a college degree.  Get your airman certificates and ratings.  In any order.      Who is paying for all this?

People will then come up with figures "60% of people in the forces end up in airlines" .. Blahhh blahh blahh. When joining these forces you get all the flight training for free and i really felt bad knowing theres a choice between paying nothing or paying something. But then i came to me, why should i waist those professional pilots time by getting all the training and then walking out on them. So i was lucky enough to get flight training on a private level. At this time, im learning to be a private pilot, then i'll build hours and get a job building up money ready for my ATPL training. My advise is theres NO RUSH, but be sure to get it all planned out. Remember, if you really want it = You'll get it.
jf0UV1Bjaa	Captains license for what? Like a charter boat or tugboats or ships.  They all have different standards.  To get you captains license for a tugboat or any other large boat rated on weight you first have to get you Merchant Mariners License which is no big deal.  Find a place that has the paper work in your area, and fill it out.  Youll need to get a passport picture and youll have to be able to pass a physical and drug test.  Once you have the paper work filled out and the physical and drug test results youll have to go to a coast guard custom station, which may not be in your state, i had to travel out of state to go to one.  They will process your papers and in 4-8 weeks give you the MMD.  That puts you out as a green inexperienced sailor with entry level ordinary seaman and swiper credentials.  Next step is finding a boat to hired on as an O/S deckhand.  After you log and work 244 twelve hour days you can upgrade you license to an able bodied seaman.  You have to go into a marine training institute and learn about colors of vessel lights, navigation, rules of the water, basic knots, basic EMT, and youll have to take a physical test of having to rapidly don an exposure suit, quickly climb steep ladders, and maintain balance on a moving surface.  After you pass that, you become an A/B and then you can take a captains course and get your 100 ton captains license and be hired on as a first mate/relief captain.  Its all a long and tough process but stick with it because the pay is generous and you can retire nicely after 20 years.

VItj8zdAaa	yes, the lower rpm will save you fuel.  it's all about the gear ratios, final drive included.  the manual may save you fuel because it's a direct drive all the time, and the automatic may waste some fuel due to torque converter slippage, but ultimately, any newer vehicle, in 5th gear automatic, is going to have torque converter lockup, which is, essentially, a direct link.  in that case, the lower rpm cruising gear is going to be better on fuel.  hope that helps|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Since when do engine revs have anything to do with fuel economy.  Throttle position, not engine revs is what determines how much fuel you use.  For example, I can be winding out my engine at 6,000rpm but if I lift my foot off the pedal the injectors shut off and I'm not using any gas, even though the revs are still high.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I'm not so sure that this is as true as it once was.   A lot, of course, depends on the driver, but the standard is positive engagement and the automatic has slippage in the converter - but this difference is negligible once the converter locks up which is what the vast majority of modern automatics do when cruising in high gear.    And, for what it's worth, people driving automatics don't rev their engines at stop lights.|`|fXmUdJQgaa	The automatic is always under a load especially at a stop light in a stick there is no load on the engine with it in neutral.  The engine is actually more efficient crusing at 3k then 2k as long as ur not accelerating|`|a8m3HdDHaa	In a manual the drive train is using zero horsepower when the clutch is depressed. In an automatic you are always using horses even in neutral since you are spinning a turbine in oil and also running a hydraulic pump all the time the engine is running.  The automatic has a lot of parasitic loads the manual does not.
AA10582974	The throttle cable might not be adjusted properly - not enough free play and holding the slide up.  Adjust the throttle cable so you can turn the throttle a bit, without putting any tension on the cable.    Is the spark plug wet when you remove it?  The engine might be flooded.  Remove the spark plug.  Turn off the petcock.  Drain the carb float bowl.  Hold the throttle WFO (wide f'n open)  Kick start it a few times to blow any fuel out of the engine.|`|gsQU85fIaa	seek a profesional bike mechanic when it comes to carbs and the fuel system cause if you do something wrong and it goes boom you cant blame anyone but yourself|`|XJSWRHdiaa	Maybe u should double-check the carb was put back in correctly because it was working before u took it out so maybe u did something wrong when u put it back in.

dQrBlk4qaa	I agree - I have an 04, and except for some brake work, mine's been a solid, dependable car. It rides extremely well, and is even trustworthy in the snow. And the purchase price made it extremely worth it.    I see a couple things with this car that would cause it to rate low. First off, the V6 has had problems with intake oil leaks. The brake rotors do have a tendency to warp with repeated hard braking. The interior styling is a little unusual and a little cheaply constructed.  And when compared to other cars in its class, it tends to appear a little dated and "rental car" (which mine was, ironically).     For some reason, though, girls like the car!

My opinion I believe that Pontiac is the best car that you can buy.|`|e34ec130ff0f1fd7cdba13b91612b6aeaa	they do have some problems.     the lower intake manifold gasket is the main problem. it fails anywhere between 40-80 thousand miles. the reason for this is cause dex-cool (the orange coolant) eats away the gasket over time. this is about a $1,000 repair. you can prevent this by switching coolant. or if it does happen, they make a replacement gasket thats metal and wont fail. personally i changed both the gasket and the coolant.      anther comman problem is wheel bearing failing. aka speed sensors. if this goes out, you'll throw a service vehicle light and your abs and traction control will turn off. wheel bearing are about $100.    the blower motor tends to not work on speeds 1-3 cause of a bad blower resistor. which is under $20 but is located so damn close to the fire wall its really a b*tch to get to.    a lot of people have also had problems with there power window motors going out. i have never had this happen, thank god, but i'm told its no fun.    last comman problem is that there is a random turn signal blinking noise that comes from the hazzard switch. it sounds like your turn signals are on, when there not. the problem is actually in your turn signal/wiper motor controlls.    other then these things, its a pretty good car. i've had my 01 sense 04, and have put about 60k miles on it. its never left me stranded (knock on wood) and has been a pretty good car overall. all cars have problems no matter what it is. and aside from the intake gasket problem, everything is pretty miner.    good luck|`|AXNkmdbKaa	They are a low line vehicle not made as expensively as the Bonneville or Gran Prix and then the purchasers tend to be low income so they do not maintain them as well and treat them worse to begin with because they are not as proud of them as they might be of say a BMW.|`|dkPbRn95aa	some people are just haters. glad you like your pontiac.|`|eb0u1h4Oaa	haha i actually drive an 86 grand am and love it, it has the 2.5 motor in it (it was actually a rental car as well! for the first 4k miles of its life) now has 130 thou on it and still runs strong! knock on wood great tranny and never had motor problems, just keep up on spark plugs and good stuff like that|`|MgTPE5H0aa	they're good cars but they do have the occasional problem being one of pontiac's lesser quality cars they don't get the foolproof performance the better ones do "same as all car branches"  GM's in general are awesome cars and are very reliable if something does brake the parts for a GM cost considerably less than a ford or Mopars.and moco is right some people give cars bad ratings because of their company name.i own a 77 Trans am that had it's engine rebuilt and modded once in '82 and my beast still runs like a champ i towed my neighbors 2004 ford f 250 home the other day in it.GM rules and that's all there is to it.|`|HUluAQM3aa	It's no accident that this car has a low rating.

Your car automatically mixes OXYGEN and GAS together to cause a combustion.(FIRE) if you don't have enough Oxygen running through your air filter you gas will not burn properly or at all just clean it or replace it if you have access to an air compressor and a spray nossle just blow it out this should help some|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	It just makes the engine have to work harder to "suck" in air...you'll lose lots of power, and gas mileage will drop severely! Replace it...they're cheap. Good luck.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if the air filter is dirty the the engine will suck dirt up into the injectors and make it miss or sometimes not start. plus it will suck gas because it changes the mixture.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	when the filter can no longer block the dirt out of the engine. it will get in the cylinders and scratch groves in cylinder walls and crank bearings.  That leads to more oil consumption less compression and performance . All along while it has a blockage in the air filter will give the engine a rich fuel mixture . Which is also bad and accelerates wear in the engine. A $10 filter can cost you thousands in repairs if goes unchanged.  I make a point to change or at least inspect the air filter every time i change the oil..every 3 months or 3000 miles .. good engine maintenance can add 50,000 to 75,000 miles to the life of a engine. I have  90 chevy Corsica with over 300,000 miles and gets almost 30 miles to the gallon. Still runs great and no signs of oil use.  That is what taking care of you car's engine can do.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Not much will get into the engine to form anything.  Will have less power due to the filter being dirty and clogged up.|`|fuNlYxS9aa	the filter will restrict the air flow. in order for an engine to work, it needs fuel (gas) ,compression (the engine rotating) and air (air from the filter). if the flow of air is clogged then the cars computer will sense that and dump more gas into the engine to compensate for the lower amount of air. hence giving you really bad gas mileage and poor engine performance. hope this helped!

How *sudden* are these *stops* from 60mph(sometimes over) down to Zero? If you have a manual shift transmission, you *HAVE* mastered the art of *hitting the clutch pedal* at the proper time BEFORE the engine stalls out and stops, haven't you? If your transmission is automatic, you aren't *locking the rear--driving wheels* and *sliding* to a stop and thus, putting a *terrific* strain on all of the automatic shifting mechanisms -- are you?    I believe that you should go back to your authorized Toyota repair shop and talk with the Head Mechanic and tell him/her every detail of what YOU are doing in operating the vehicle and what "faults" the vehicle has in its performance to your operations -- in YOUR opinion.
UycnSRXbaa	Like the other guy said, check your coolant level, make sure you have the level is on the max.    Does this happens when the car is at a stand still?    It sound it could be 2 thing.    1. you could have an air lock in the system, some mechanics don't relies that when you drain the coolant system, you need to bleed the air out of it. If there is air in the system, the coolant cannot circulate.  This is often forgotten about because some cars self bleed.    2. one of the hoses or radiator itself may be split cause air to be drawn in or fluid to be lost.|`|QbRPW3tYaa	i have the same problem.....  check your coolant/antifreeze levels.... see if your heater works.... my heater doesnt work at all and my temperature level shoots up to the red, and sometimes it just stays in the blue.

Its causing the guage to shoot up or stay low and my heater doesnt work.  you probably have the same issue.|`|aaa541c5b479e070afff9a47a25ec1adaa	First, check your coolant level.  If it's too low, add the appropriate coolant.  If the coolant level is good, then your thermostat more than likely failed and you need to replace it.  Also, don't drive your car if its in the red zone.

In highly congested areas such as the North East the cost to store and service the airplane is much more of a liability than purchasing one.

If you insist on new you can pay as little as $75,000 for something with two seats. That's less than the cost of a house.

They're no different than someone who has other toys like boats, snowmobiles, ATVs, etc.    Most of us don't buy new. You can get a really nice used single for less than $50,000.|`|o5KbZk1saa	Yes. And usually nice planes at that.  I own a Mooney ( and i am not a doctor) and the guy in the hanger next to me is a doctor and he flys a Pilatus.

kfeXJVTWaa	1st of all... i wouldn't ever turbocharge a v6 automatic mustang!!!    2nd... what the hell is a cherry bomb exhaust and if you truly want to turbo charge that engine your looking @ a $6000 job at the minimum... Then your probably just blow a piston rite through your block and not be driving your mustang anymore.     3rd... That particular mustang wasn't meant to have work done to it... just drive the car and save your money... do alot of homework on cars and then spend your money wisely, but not on that!!!    4th... im not trying to be mean, but if you put money into that car and flash forward 1yr. to about the time when you will figure out that you wasted money and time on something not worth it and will have plenty of ideas to work on a real mustang then you thank me... some cars just were not made for performance extras.... if you wanted a 97 you should have went with a GT at least, but even still i wouldnt buy anything less then a 97 Cobra.|`|aIXeSThOaa	your safest option is to take it to a shop they will install it properly and most places will offer some sort of warranty, if you don't have the money theres heaps of turbo kits you can buy which simply just bolt on and theres heaps of mufflers and exhaust tips available on eBay but the general consensus is that they don't last very long.  good luck|`|nU84u2poaa	yell, take the cherry bomb to the muffler shop, but if you put a turbo in you will have to get stronger connection rods, & pistons,   all new internals, and you will have to improve the cooling system, and put in a turbo timer, & reprogram the cpu, and if i was you i would put in a 5sp, wit a racing clutch, but wit the auto, you will have to change out the converter wit a higher stall, because with a turbo you are adding like 200hp, and if you were to pull it out, and put it in drive and floor it, the tranny will rip its self apart,

Unless you know what you are doing.  The fit-all from the mid 70s will work with either a chevy or olds engine.  Otherwise, you will need an adapter.  Try JEGS or SUMMIT for an adapter.  Also trans-dapt may sell them on line.  It would probably be best to replace the olds engine with a chevy engine.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Your 84 would have likely been a 200r4.  A 350 is not going to be a direct swap.  The 200r4 was a longer transmission so that introduces other things that need to be swapped. Like the others are saying the first problem is the bell housing.  You need a 'BOP'  which is Buick Olds Pontiac (also Cadillac).  Chevy was(is) the oddball.  That pretty much means that you are going to be looking for a 70's car without a chevy motor since by the 80's the BOP's were usually 200's.   The next issue is things like the rear mount and linkage things.  Also speedo drive gear and output splines and drive shaft length.    A good transmission shop can easily rebuild that 200r4 to take more power than you could ever get out of that 307.  That way you keep everything 'stock' so it will be easier to maintain down the road and you still get the benefits of  overdrive and lockup.   The turbo Grand Nationals used that same transmission so even back then they had them tweaked to hold up better than the typical stock ones.  I know people that are running an honest 400HP and even go to the strip on the weekends with those transmissions and are very happy.|`|WMi9r95faa	the tranny will fit, but make sure you have the correct bellhousing and shift cables, and you may need to modify or get a new transmission crossmember
AA10582974	The choke on that model is cable operated.  Fix it.    2/6/09  No gas on the plugs - check the cylinder compression.  Perform a cylinder leak down test - the valves could be tight (needing adjustment), or leaking.    The engine will not crank fast enough to produce enough vacuum to lift the throttle slides, to get fuel from a different circuit, other than the choke, or slow speed (sorry about the run-on sentence).  That could be why the plugs aren't getting wet.    The carbs may need to be cleaned.  Open the gas cap and look in the tank - any rust or junk floating around - carbs need cleaning.  Drain the gas out of each carb float bowl (screw on the bottom of the carbs) into a clean cup - any foreign matter - carbs need cleaning.  No gas comes out - check the petcock (fuel on/off valve).    That petcock is vacuum opperated.  Vacuum from the engine cranking pulls a diaphragm open to allow fuel to come out of the tank.  Very small diameter outlet tube on the petcock is for the vacumm.  It should be connected to the front of carb  2 with a hose.  Attach a hose to that outlet and apply a vacuum source (mighty-vac, or suck on it).  Fuel should come out of the large outlet.  If not, replace the petcock (I'm assuming there is enough gas in the tank).    You're an auto mech - remove the carbs and clean them yourself.  It's not that complicated for someone with mechanical ability.  All that is needed is a few common hand tools and a can of carb cleaner.  With the aid of a parts diagram and service manual - piece of cake.  http://www.bikebandit.com/parts/  http://www.motocom.com/motorcycles/    Your bill is up to $50  If you want me to do the actual work, it will be considerably higher :)|`|lM9NvSwnaa	After cranking for an hour you should have seen some fuel or signs of it on the plugs.  I would suggest, now that you have it running, to dump an entire bottle-8-10 oz size down in the gas tank and run the hell out of it.  Run an entire tank of fuel out of the bike.    As for the $600 remark about it costing to have the carbs cleaned/rebuilt, I had to laugh, Should not be more than $300 tops plus any parts.|`|6xpyZCzbaa	My guess you're asked to run a carb cleaner or a fuel additive, I would recommend SeaFoam fuel additive.|`|5N8DRf4Jaa	Yeah you can clean those puppies yourself, especially being a car mechanic. Not that tough. :)    Also those carbs should be so full of gas that its leaking out the overflow tube, so yeah a good cleaning should do the trick. Unless of course there is not enough vacuum in the cylinder cause lack of compression and its not pulling the fuel.    But yeah apply same principles as you would being a car mechanic, think simple first. :)

nAzbLdBCaa	This is one area where I'm considered an expert,  both by trraining and experiance.  Recently I've been working with two other live-aboards, who are trying to reduce their electric bills.  From prior experiance I know that poly-urethane board has the highesr R value, but I caution that the use of R value alone is not useful in boats.  In these two boats  we used the foil "bubble-rap" ( for the fitst time),  fiber blanket (glass fiber) and Urethane board type as well as some water pipe insulation.  The "radiant foam" has the advantage of blocking off air gaps and being easy to conform to the hull.  The blanket (vaper barrier one side) has the advantage of lowest cost, and can be stuffed in void areas, where appearance is not a concern.  Then using ridged 1 1/2 or 1 inch board for the overhead and bulkhead.  On the overhead we used the existing headliner and or, a prefinished fiberglass planel from Home Depot at $30 a 4x8 sheet.  I worked on the design of spray equipment in the 1960's and I think it's use vs. effectiveness, is marginal in this case.  Also be forewarned that there are fire hazards in it's use. so far I'm a little disapointed in the foil-bubble effectiveness.  But we have reached our goal of a 20% REDUCTION IN ELECTRIC USE.  The foilrap may prove more effective in the summer sun.  The ridged board has proven the most effective so far, but was more difficult to install. I'm in my third year with this in my boat.  I was a little surprised at the cost effectiveness of the fiberglass blanket.  one of the boats I'm working on with the owner is a 74' 37 Tarton, which had no insulation at all.  Bottom line, so far, no one insulation has proven to be both effective insulation and cost effective to install.  I havent ben impressed with the 'pink' foam board, the "yellow' is much better. and I've got reservations about the foil-bubble insulation.  If I had to recommend an area to start, is remove the overhead paneling, if applicable and put 1 1/2 inch rigid urthane foam board on the overhead, then reinstall the paneling or replave with the fiberglass paneling.  It will give you the most for the least cost. Good Luck!|`|I7NkFJo2aa	The reason the original insulation had mold was possibly due to the sweating, or condensation that formed between the hull skin and the foam and whatever else sealed it.  Any other membrane you fit will have the same potential to create liquid, and it has to go somewhere...    Spray polyurethane insulation may be good, trimmed flush and covered with thin plastic sheet-board or thin epoxied ply to make a solid addition that will have much less potential for trapping moisture.  Perhaps sheets of expanded urethane foam cut to fit well, gaps filled with spray foam then glassed over and sealed with two pack will work well.    Ventilation is critical for any boat - also the air in the boat should be positively moved, ducted fans from solar panels, deflector scoops mounted onto deck vents or hatches.    The old polystyrene type sheeting often used back then is far less effective at insulating than urethane foam, about 6 to 1 less effective in fact.  It is why modern iceboxes are so much better than the older ones.    Whatever you do don't make a moisture trap against the hull!    You may want to consider a heat reflective coating judiciously applied to the topsides which will be more effective than the original idea.    Edit    Good points Richard C.    I stick with the urethane foam board glassed over as most effective - I have just installed four fish rooms / freezer storage in a 67m fishing vessel, using injected foam behind marine ply glassed over.   And have done several cool rooms and freezer containers for commercial use, including my own.   I haven't found a better way either on cost or effectiveness.      We are very fortunate in this part of the world with boating, might get a bit too much heat, not cold.  So we tend to put up shade and ventilation - and our winters are very mild so it's not too bad all year anyway.  We think its cold in the low teens centigrade.|`|JqJGlvCXaa	A boat shop will be able to answer your question
AA11754206	yeah its a good car but its expensive to maintain you can find them in the U.S.A. fairly easily they go from 80-100k depending on year, and any extras people may have had done if used. you can get info from honda motor company. and if you just want to find one seems to always be one for sail the the depont car registry.

AA11754206	you'd want an older one like a cj7 the new ones are ok as long as you stay up with the maintenance but the old ones are better. the bad side to these are they are very hard to insure my uncle has a cj7 is a cop(so they know he has driving training) with nothing on his record and had a hard time finding insurance at age 55, they don't get great gas mileage average about 14 if you don't have to heavy of foot in the city. you'd be better looking into an old fj40 they are cheaper to insure can go just about anywhere had a straight 6 in them that was though as nails, easy to work on since they are all mechanical, and they made so many of them its easy to find parts at wrecking yards for cheap if anything goes wrong with it.|`|AA11745513	they dont have the best reliablility but there well made. and they do tip over easy cause they arent a sports car and arent made to be doing right hand corners at 30mph. they have a high center of gravity. if you lift it and put big tires on it it will be really easy to tip.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	If you jerk the steering wheel or over correct, the jeeps are prone to rollovers.|`|LT9VHxr5aa	any vehicle can tip over if you go on the wrong angle.  i don't believe they are any good for towing a horse float,  they look good but,  parts can be expensive|`|nU84u2poaa	bad gas mileage, very unsafe, easy to flip, the breaks are crap,  high insurance, lots of problems with there tranny's, easy to flip, trust me i know, mine has been setting in my drive way for 3 years, no body wants it, my ex girl frind had 1 with 20k miles and it was the some story|`|6PEZcgwPaa	Your insurance man will love you$$$$$$$$$$$

All of those things are usually changed at 100,000 miles, then again at 200,000 miles.    Make sure they were changed. Other than that you should not have many problems depending on the brand.  If it is a Honda/Acura or Subaru or Toyota/Scion/Lexus, then you should be fine for at least the next 150,000 miles.    Replace sparkplugs every 2 years. Replace air filter every 6,000 miles.

AA11745513	drop the trans, replace the bearing. if your going through that much trouble it would really be pointless not to replace the whole clutch assembly and put on a new flywheel or have the old one resurfaced at a machine shop.

902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	An infrequent occurrence.    If approved (used to be both superintendents had to approve the move), the request for seniority exchange will result in the change of location, and the lowest seniority will apply to both after change.  It used to be father/son would exchange seniority with the kids always moving up on the ladder.  So, the least seniority was applied to eliminate this activity.    Which means, the oldest person may be looking at losing several years seniority in the swap.  The swap may have to have Lodge approval as well, if employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts.  Not sure, but seniority exchanges tend to draw attention...  considering it is also not unknown for guys to "sell" their seniority number as a part of the deal.  People who are at retirement age at the time of the swap aren't going to get away with it.    Seniority is THE only currency anyone has for a position on the board, so it is usually watched very closely by anyone who holds seniority...  and even one number can make a world of difference.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	I've heard of it being done when I was on the UP, not real common. I tried but no one wanted to move to where I was working, like me everyone wanted to leave LOL.   A swap might be better than transferring and starting over at the very bottom.   If I remember right both people swapping had to take the date of the youngest one doing the move, and it had to be approved by both union lodges.  If it allows you to move to a district where you are wanting to move, and vice versa with the other "swapee" it can be a good deal, it's just not something that happened very often.

At the same time, watch the tread area of the tire and see if you note any unusual up/down or side/to/side movement of the tire as it goes around.    The tech may decide that putting each wheel/tire back on the balancer to diagnose the problem may be easier...to each his own.

gTuUT4Wmaa	it sounds like a Pretty good deal.  2 things to look at first...  vr6 engines are Pretty good if taken care of but can get expensive once something breaks  the price is Pretty cheap which leads me to think that he's selling it for that much because the miss fire thing might be something more then just a tune up.i would recommend that you get a mechanic or a friend that could advise you about cars to come with you and check it out.  and get them to do the tune up first to fix that miss fire thing and take it for a test drive for like an hour or so(you can't really tell much about the car that you drove for 2 minutes) and if everything's ok then buy it.and make sure you get the warranty if possible.  good luck and be careful!|`|fdTgA1Svaa	Sounds ok. The misfire might be the coils. I'd have that checked as well. It does have alot of miles in my opinion. Price seems ok . I bought a 04 Jetta GLS, 1.8 turbo for 8400 with only 73k. WVs are great cars. I'd might look around for another one and compare the two. The coils for those cars are like $40 a piece too.
Fsmji7XNaa	NO them tips wont change the sound at all! If you want a rumble for the Dakota, check into magnaflow exhaust system! They sound great, but its giong to cost you alot more than 50 bucks! Good luck!
j34yVFR0aa	autoinsurance.noneto.com - check these plans. As I know their rates for bad driving record is not such expensive as from other companies.|`|AA10409227	It depends on many factors, including your location, what kind of car you will drive, etc. There is no way of "estimating" this. If you are smart, you'll talk to a lawyer familiar with MV issues, about the situation, and maybe he can give you some advice to minimize the damage (like attending a driver safety class).|`|9AUmp5jWaa	First of all, the rates vary by state.  It sounds like you are young so right there is an increase, driving w/o a license, strike two.  Those two are $2K increases.  Next, your insurance does not stay the same for 3 years...it goes up every year.  After the ticket comes off your license your insurance will not decrease.  Insurance is sometimes determined by your credit score, age, demographics.  Again, depends on your state.  If I were to give an estimate using my state's parameters, I would estimate that the insurance would be about $3000 for a 6 month policy.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Everything depends on what state your in.    In CA tickets stay on your record for 3 years.  After that your rate would go down when they come off your DMV record.    You need to go to the DMV and get a copy of your driving record to see what it shows.       There is a plan for people with suspended drivers licenses which are considered "high risk drivers" to get their license back.   It is called "assigned risk."    Find an agent that writes it and ask for a quote.   Some agents are better at this than others.   So, if you find one that doesn't seem to know about it, then move on.
KstxPYPTaa	You should be able to get that done for around $150.00 depending on the location your at. I generally do them for 130.00-150.00. Some dealers that I do work for on a regular basis I do a little cheaper.       But the thing to remember with a dealer is there is no way they can program a key for that car without having the car which means plan on having a tow fee on top of whatever they charge you to program the key. A locksmith will come to you.       I not quite sure why people insist on saying locksmiths can not program chip/transponder equipped cars. While there may be some shops that haven't invested in the equipment. Most can and indeed do these on a regular basis.  Aaron I'm sorry to say you are completely wrong and have absolutely no idea of what your talking about. I would invite you to check out a company called advanced diagnostics. they have been providing programming equipment to locksmiths for years.        The only difference in my equipment and what the dealer uses is I'm not limited to one make.|`|AA11264416	if the key has a chip in it then you'll have to go to the dealer, no way around it, sorry, if it was without a chip you could just get a locksmith to get it made without having to change the locks, but since yours has a chip in it you have no other choice but to go to the dealer|`|bvCkplELaa	umm I'd use a little bit of common sense as costs vary from where you live.

r5EwvgQHaa	I used to work for a couple of Goodyear shops, and the blue coloring is just a soap used to protect the letters during manufacturing, and shipping. A good tire  store SHOULD have washed it off for you, but if you need to do it yourself, take some hot soapy water, and wet the blue, and let it soak for about 20 minutes, then hose it off with fairly high pressure water, should come off with little effort.|`|1fjXNY7Waa	It is just glue. It will come off on it's own. It always does on all the sets of tires I have purchased in the past.|`|ThEm8DCkaa	You could have all 4 tires turned around with the letters facing the inside.

Freeze plugs can be expensive because often they are located behind exhaust manifolds or in an unaccessible location, and water pumps aren't cheap either.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	That would depend on what color fluid you'd like to fill it back    up with.

bvCkplELaa	No.|`|AA12095978	a leaky power steering system wont' affect the operation of the radiator fan.  they are completely separate.  if your fan isn't spinning as fast, it's morethan likely due to age. you have a 18 year old car, things are going to wear out. usualy though the fan simply stop working.  but spinning slow is a rare one.  you might want to check the voltage to the fan & be sure it's getting the proper 12 volts.

ruvjlMikaa	First of all if you ride through any water or mud your going to wish you had an box. A slip on exhaust, an air filter kit, and a jet kit.

RTBvQJHbaa	first off cork gaskets usually don't need sealant, second off are you tightening the pan properly? skip sides  and keep the bolts as even as possible when crossing sides. Also what did you clean the surface with?  Gasket remover I hope not a hammer and chisel ;) a little emery cloth to get a good little shine, and make sure the bolts are tight but not superman tight.  It could just be a couple of bolts need to be down a little more but if you have got them pretty tight I would start over from scratch. also make SURE there is not oil on either surface when tightening it back down.  If you see a heaping helping of sealant coming out that is not good, it will get in the internal engine parts and gum stuff up. usually a oil pan bolt needs around 15 to 25 ftlbs alittle less then a spark plug if you know what I mean just don't snap one off or mess up the holes, alittle sealant around the threads of the bolts would help as well. The pan just needs to be clean and dry before you add the oil back in as well or it can sneak through.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	The oil could be coming out of the rear or front main seal and you cant see it. The front and rear main seal are so close to the oil pan that it can make it look the the oil pan gasket.|`|9uAYLQz8aa	A few Questions: Where is the location of the Leak/drip, front of the pan or rear of the pan, middle of the Pan? What color is the oil after it hits the ground?  If the engine is dirty in that area of the leak, you may want to clean it off with some GUNK ENGINE CLEANER and a hose....then look for the leak while the engine is running. You may find it may not be the pan, but something else...Get back to me...thanx
MOv9fxjHaa	well, you could probably find a used Subaru WRX (4 cylinder turbo) for that much, its pretty fast, not STI fast but its easy to mod. Also look into a Mustang GT 1999-2004, Camaro SS, both V8's the SS is supercharged. You could probably get a Dodge SRT-4 for that much, You'd kill almost anything on a roll (under v8 anyway) WRX would give the gt and the camaro a run for its money from a dead stop. Just depends what you want.|`|39ixfEIraa	depends wat u want really, i like the 2001-2003 grand prix gt, idk wat types of car u want, but they are pretty fast in my oppinion, not bad on gass, u can get it four door and it looks sporty, it has a nice sound, its spacious has good options and u can get a 01 for about anywhere from 4,000-9,000$$ depending on conditions and such, and a 03' would probibly run u 11,000$ or so...good luck|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	My Dodge Caliber was over 18,000 and I guess I'm glad you think that's a cool car.

UTT6P72vaa	I have an NRA sticker on my car. That kind of acts like a scarecrow for car thieves. The image of them being turned into Swiss cheese if they dare to hot wire the car usually sends them scrambling to the next vehicle. Also religious ornaments. Some car thieves come from superstitious cultures. A plastic crucifix or a plastic Jesus on the dashboard usually does the trick. Better yet, get something of Mary and they would be cursed to Hell if they even think of stealing your car.    Seriously, my insurance company mailed me a list of the top vehicles in demand by car thieves in my area. My car was not on the list. If my car was stolen it would be worth more in the insurance claim than if I traded it in to a car dealership. Hence, ain't nobody gonna steal my car.   I actually helped some guys at my office nail a car thief at one of my former employers. We caught him after he broke the passenger's side window. We cornered him and threw him down on the street and called the cops. Don't know what happened to that guy.

A thief could be stalking an area, but if they are just walking up and down the street, they can't be arrested for that.      There are some people like store security guards who are really good at spotting suspicious behavior just by watching body language.  When you see someone suspicious, keep watching them.  If you have a video camera, even better.  Eventually, the thief will get caught.  It's just a matter of time, and a little luck, or a vigilant witness, or alert citizen, or dumb criminal who leaves his wallet at the scene of the crime or something like that.     Lights and cameras do wonders to discourage bad behavior.|`|KstxPYPTaa	Why, you trying not to blow your cover?|`|LOAg9w1Iaa	there's no way you can tell who's going to steal a car by looking at them. some people steals car for joy ride and some people steal to sell car parts.|`|cf9727f7ab8a1e4d60ac0d6d6265ba2aaa	According to a 2005 study, 92% of all car thefts were committed by 45 year old blonde-haired blue-eyed men wearing red shirts and khaki shorts.

I live kind of out in the sticks a bit, there are a few pubs plus one train station and 2 taxi ranks.  People would come out of the pub having missed their train home and drank their taxi fare so they'd look for old cars to break in to - the reason being that old cars (I'm in the UK so talking cars registered around the 1991 mark) as they don't have alarms or immobilisers and most of them are so flimsy the door can be popped open with reletive ease. This actually happened to my 1st car, bitter experience!    However, I also live near people who own top of the range Mercs and BMW's and these cars would also be targetted - hook through letterbox to grab the keys and then the car would be towed away and shipped abroad.    If someone is walking down the street checking car handles and looking inside, I'd be concerned no matter how expensive my car was.
36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	While I agree with Wrench and gmgypsy that you should stay out of debt. Most dealers offer financing from the manufacturer. Yamaha is offering $69 a month payments on that model with approved credit. But be warned that payment is only good for 2 years if you have not paid the debt off in that time the payment and interest rate will increase. To pay off the amount you say you need ($6500) in 2 years you would have to pay about $300 a month. Since you are still in college I would listen to Wrench and gmgypsy.|`|56l26dvCaa	Wrench said it.

You can do simple things like adding a highflow air filter, cold air intake, exhaust headers, high flow catalytic converter. If you want more then you can port an polish the head, add aftermarket camshafts for longer valve opening times, and bore and stroke the block.    Lastly you can make your engine forced induction by adding a turbocharger or supercharger.    If you still want to do an engine swap, I would recommend going to a custom shop and getting some input from them.

Example: Your Truck is  a 2008 Mistsubishi Raider and the sports a 1990's Chevrolet Camero. If he hit you either your side or drivers side you door would have been pushed at least a 2-4 feet into the cab of the truck. It is also possible that the truck would have rolled onto it's side or best spun around. Both you and your father would have injuries but speed will determine what these were.   If you hit the sports car depending on the side you hit then the driver of that vehicle would have some sort of injuries as your truck is higher than his car and would hit right about at his shoulder and the drivers door would be pushed at least 2-4 feet into his car. At 35mph he could sustain head injuries and left side injuries.     All this all depends on the speed, types of vehicles and year. Older model trucks were not required to have the same door protection as a car because they were considered higher and could with stand a T-bone crash. All trucks made after 1988 required to have doors like those used on cars to protect drive passenger from side impact collisions.     Check out these web sites and you can read up on this and check other sights also. I have this sites included to help you understand what can happen and how to try and prevent this from happening to you agian. Glad you two are safe. If you are still conserned about what happened you may want talk to your dad or church pastor or bishop about what happend and how you feel. It can help you over come what you are or might start to feel in the future espeicaly when you beagn to drive.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/car_crash  http://www.car-accidents.com/side-impact...|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well if you were hit, there could have been extensive damage done to both of the vehicles but it is based on the speed of the impact and the size of the vehicles.  Now if you are in an accident you do not want to panic.  Make sure that you stay where you are.  Do not flee the scene whether you caused the accident or you were the victim.  At the moment of the accident usually paramedics and police officers come to the scene to aid the victims.  Once they come, you and the person who hit you are expected to file a police report.  What that means is you give an account of what happened.  Secondly, you want to make sure that you have your insurance information handy such as the registration.  Then you provide that information to the person that hit you.  Basically you and the other driver exchange insurance information.  Now based on who hit who, the person that caused the accident is at fault, and their insurance if they have any must pay for the damages caused.  Also depending on how severe the accident is you may be taken to a local hospital, but the main thing is to stay where you are until the scene has been cleared.  Just be glad that you were not involved and that you are ok.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	Idk....boom, crash, damage, smoke, injury, possibly death??    Not sure why you're asking this....    Don't you know what a car accident looks like?|`|DekGIOImaa	The hit could have been tragic. I'm glad you and your dad are okay. He must have some good reflexes to avoid a car jumping a light.   Sometimes you can't help but wonder..."what if...". You guys must have had a guardian angel watching over you.
uDhiOQWDaa	No, HID's take only 20secs to a 1 minute to retain their full color. You most likely got a knockoff kit from China, I say this because I did the same thing. I got rid of that kit and I purchased a 8k HID kit from http://www.xenonvisions.com. It was only $110 and it was a great kit that was blue.       HID Kits at only $110  214-272-0297  http://www.xenonvisions.com|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Are the bulbs it came with supposed to?
ogSUrN70aa	The charging system on your car will hardly notice the additional load.  Besides once the unit is fully charged, it will not drain any energy from your car's charging system.  We're probably talking on the order of 2-3 amperes of current to charge this 'jump box' as we call it, where your system on your car is designed to provide at least 50 amps or more of power at it's peak.    I challenge you to calculate the cost in fuel that this negligible charging load will consume. :>)|`|ThEm8DCkaa	It will make your alternator work a little bit harder, and your gas mileage drop slightly. I doubt you will notice a difference. If you charge it during the day with your headlights off and your heater on low or off, your alternator won't know the difference.
buLYCudWaa	Are you sure it was a new radiator and not reconditioned one.  If it was reconditioned it might have a flaw.  Agree with the pressure check.  Sometimes you have to make sure that the hose line up so there is no kinks in them, even if you have the clamps tight it still might leak.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Did you change the radiator cap also? If the cap is bad, it cant hold pressure and will leak out antifreeze|`|bLjGM9yNaa	You went through all the trouble of replacing this and never replaced    the cap ?  Well, that aside, I would take the radiator back for another    one, And have the cap pressure tested for peace of mind. Replace    it even if it's good. You probably just got a defect.       I hope you have better luck on the next rad.|`|vJGsV0Yuaa	Best way to confirm where it is leaking is have it pressure tested and go from there|`|bvCkplELaa	I agree, use some common sense and pressure test it.
0Mj9b0Aoaa	I cannot tell you for sure what the problem is but I'd be leaning towards the intake gasket on that vehicle.  Your best bet is to get the dealer to diagnose the problem and if you don't like their repair cost then go somewhere else to repair it.  It'll cost you a bit more on diagnosis but the dealer has the best equipment, training and experience to look at your vehicle.|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	You're car is never too old to visit a dealership, it's just about the cost. There are some things that can only be fixed by the dealership, but they are always the most expensive route and sometimes it's a matter of fiscal savvy-ness. At what point is it more feasible to get a newer car then to be sinking money into an older car?|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	Unless the repairs/service is under warranty, I do not recommend going to the dealer.  I would recommend finding a reputable auto mechanic for assistance.|`|39WRk789aa	probably just needs a new thermostat, but your car is never to old for the dealership, most people don't' go there cause they are anywhere from 80-100$ an hr. for labor, but they usually know a lot more about your car that people like midas or jiffy lube. take it to the dealer they can get you fixed up if you can't do it yourself. Or if you have a family friend that is a mechanic ask them to see if they will help you out first try to save you some money.
Og3vKQeWaa	oooh that`s not good! When petrol gets compressed, by 20:1 compression ratio, it can be quite bad for a diesel engine. The heavy rattling you hear, is the sound of engine components, being put under enormous stress and if you are very unlucky, you may find your crank, con rods, or head gasket, may fail...big time!|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Put as much diesel in as you can afford, if the tank was filled right up then it'd nearly all be diesel anyway.  Before winter diesel was produced, when most diesels were in commercial vehicles it was standard practice to use a quarter petrol or even a third if it was very cold, to prevent the diesel from waxing (freezing) in the fuel lines.  It's probably a good idea not to drive hard or labour the engine at low revs on hills until you've further diluted the petrol.  At least it should start easily on a cold morning.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	modern diesels cannot function corectly with petrol in the system it can burn holes in the pistons. your fuel pump not be properly lubricated which will be rather costly too repair the high pressure pump. it used too be you could get away with a 10% mix of petrol in diesel this was on vehicles made before 1999. now the safe mix is 1%  contact local garage for imediate repair. you may get away with driving in the short term but i gaurentee you will have problems with the car in future.    have a butchers at this    http://www.nu-car.com/Diesel_Buyers_Guid...|`|BWXZf6j4aa	Old, primitive diesels could used petrol/diesel mixtures especially in  very cold weather as it stopped the diesel thickening.  The risk is that the petrol will damage the rubber seals and components in a modern 'common rail' type.   As you have presumably run the engine since, any damage will soon be evident.   You may be lucky!  The best advice is to not use the engine any more, get the tank drained and refill with straight diesel.    Also, garages will want to charge you extra to dispose of the contaminated fuel, so if possible find a large container to take it away -at least as a bargaining point!|`|f6ae2bf2ebd4ad49b32dea3818324e4caa	it should really have been drained out, modern diesels do not like petrol in their fuel systems.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You will probably need to have the tank drained and cleaned.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	it may rattle a bit but you should be ok,keep putting diesel in to dilute the petrol|`|21bf104810db24cdcc8e23a34e620563aa	I think that you have watered it down enough not to cause any harm but I would ring your local garage to ask their advise
f5ibT3WNaa	If the handle is broke your going to have to take the door panel off and reach up there and take the rod loose and take the 2 bolts off and the handle will come right out.|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	I would recommend taking your car to a reputable auto body shop for an estimate.  It may be repaired, or needs to be replaced, but at least you'll know once it is checked out.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Pick a fight 05 sure has it right.  I went through 2 pull-a-part junkyards looking for good handles for my Astro and they were all broken.  I got some cheaper at Certi-fit.  They are an aftermarket body parts supplier on the Internet.  Try some others also as they are much cheaper than the dealers.|`|AA10331789	http://www.mobil1.com/USA-English/MotorO...    http://www.junkyarddog.com/    http://car-part.com/|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!

LuqZXXyBaa	Are you currently insured? If so ask your insurer for a CLUE report or LOE(Letter of Experience). Either letter will list all chargeable claims and accidents. If you're wanting to know why your quotes are so high ask the agent running your reports. They'll tell you whats on the report and give you a phone   if you need to dispute any of the information.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Insurance companies run your motor vehicle report which they get from each states department of motor vehicles.  The program used to get the MVR is Choicepoint.  Just contact your local DMV and ask for a copy of your MVR.    Another report companies use is called a CLUE report.  This is also received from Choicepiont.  It lists all claims you've made going back about 5 years.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	You can get that info from your state's DMV, but you may have to pay a fee for it.  Here in Indiana we can do it online after setting up an account with the DMV web site.  Check your DMV's web site to find out whether you can, and how.    Your record may include accidents if they were reportable; it will depend on the state requirements.  Many companies use a system called CLUE--Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange--to list accidents, and you can't access that; it's only for insurers.  However, a company should explain its surcharges if you ask.
RTBvQJHbaa	Bob web is giving good stuff, mice and rodents are likely to build nests in the ducting as well.  If it has a lot of air moving its probably not that, Coolant should smell a little sweat and you may notice coolant on the floor or such.  easy way to see if your drian is working is to run ac at full tilt on a dry patch of pavement you should see a little water to a lot depending on humidity, give it about 3-5 mins before checking.  If the drain is plugged locate it and un-plug it, or replace the hose if it is hose style and use a pipe cleaner to get the rest out of where it hooks to.  If its pluged while your there spray some Lysol in there (remove cabin filter and spray)  If its not pushing the air like it should usually the fan can be taken out and the stuff removed, and DISINFECT!!!!!  Any problem resulting in contamination of that system should be cleaned because you will breath what ever is in there!|`|UKNmZsU5aa	You might need to change your cabin air filter.  It can get dirty and not filter polluted air.   This happens in my Saturn in the summer when I don't have the A/C button clicked in, just to put that out there.  Good luck.|`|3UQrUNMSaa	I have this problem too!    Spray aircon deodorizer into it.|`|AA10331789	If it smells like antifreeze engine coolant, you may have a leaking heater core.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	Alpine recommends 1.625 cubic foot of internal volume for a sealed enclosure.  That is without the sub displacement.  With the sub displacement it is 1.75 cubic foot.      You can read this in the manual.  The "gross internal volume" includes all displacment.  The "net internal volume" doesn't include any displacement from the sub.    Alpine gives a range of 1.3 cubic foot to 2.5 cubic foot for a sealed enclosure.  That is "gross" internal volume.  Whenever they say that they mean that the sub displacment is included in that measurement.     You have plenty of space for a ported enclosure.  I would highly recommend that instead of a sealed enclosure.  You will get more output from a ported enclosure.  If it is built properly you can get more output and maintain good overall sound quality from your subs.    Good Luck!!!|`|pI9Ebsymaa	i dont know alot on building enclosures, but i know a bit about type r's.    GO PORTED!!! either learn how to design and build ported enclosures or go to a local shop and have one built for around $200. It's definitely worth it to get a ported box for type rs. esp. 15's.|`|TJ1HMKL1aa	go ported for 15s|`|exYJISb3aa	http://www.fishercustoms.com/    They'll do it alll for you.  BJ Fisher is a very very very great enclosure builder.  He'll let you know if you should go ported, sealed, whatever.  He gives you cut sheets, keeps you up to date with pics whatever you want.    I personally would go ported.
RWjvcCYoaa	As long as your credit union does NOT use Rule 78 for their loans, you will be able to save a lot of finance charges by paying it off sooner. Once you get your money, call and ask for your "10 day payoff". That figure will be less than the total amount owed. It will only be for the principle, no interest included.     When you make an early payoff, you pay just the principle alone. You don't pay the remaining finance charges. Depending on your APR, that could mean $100's less. Or $1000's less!|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I have a large amount comming back to me on my taxes   --------------    That sucks.    That's YOUR money (not some bounus handout) that you could have already used to pay down on the principal of the loan.    Have your withholding adjust ASAP.    Nothing like letting the gubmint have your money for free all year long.|`|dPULl5hjaa	The day you want to pay the loan off call the credit union and asking for a pay off amount.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	you can try - but they do not have to accept it.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	They will let you pay it off early, which will save you a lot of interest. If that $25,800 is the cost if it runs the full length of the loan (interest and principal) then yes your payoff will be much less. Basically the payoff is whatever the current balance plus interest since last payment was made.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	They do not have to negotiate or accept less than the total amount of the outstanding loan.|`|213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	It's not in their best interest to accept less than your buyout. You are already obligated to pay a certain amount and if you want to pay it sooner, you will save interest. It's unlikely they will take a lesser amount because they will actually be loosing money. Good luck and I hope this helps.

ErGQOhjqaa	I'd check a couple of things.  If the engine is turning over fast enough to start, but just won't catch, then sputters to life, it may be getting too much fuel. Ask your mechanic about it.  If it does not spin fast enough, you might change the brand of oil you're using.  I had an old plymouth that simply would not turn over fast enough to start in cold weather.  A friend advised me to change from quaker state oil to Pennzoil, and I never had it fail to start again.|`|5M0FBU89aa	If it has EFI, did you clean the injectors?|`|vmNHuAKjaa	your oil might be too thick and it could freeze and make it hard to crank that and with a battery that don't have enough cold cranking amps would make it hard for you to start|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Uh, how can this engine not have a distributor?

Any of these could cause your car to bounce.
Ld7dOtGUaa	I see Demons and Dusters with 440's in them all the time.  It will take a little modification, I recommend that you buy one of the engine swap kits.   http://www.engine-swaps.com/   This will make the swap much easier.    Another thought is to buy a 340 or 360 block bore it out to 30 over and install a 4 inch crank.  This build will put out close to 600hp and 600 lbs torque if built right.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	its more than just a simple "bolt in / bolt out". the entire front end suspension cant handle the extra weight. you need a new radiator for better cooling. the whole car needs to be rewired. you need a new tranny. you need a new exhaust system. your looking at spending a lot of money.  i think its cheaper to just get a 340 demon(everythings already there)|`|7Jxk9IZDaa	You need a V-8 crossmember for the engine and then it will fit.No cutting is needed but you might want to and headers are available to fit under chassis or you can use the manifolds from a Super Bee and the pipes from a MonacoThe radiator I used was from a larger car with a 440|`|9496974db835ff1a0850895b0709efe8aa	In my humble opinion, you're much better off putting a 360 or 340 in that car. Not only is it more of a killer engine than a 383, but the car doesn't require the modifications you need for the 383. Plus, the small blocks breathe better in that little space unless you use some fenderwell headers - 383s in A-bodies had restricted exhaust manifolds (they were offered through 1969).|`|JvxrCb2Paa	It can be done without cutting up the front end using Schumachers engine kits (see G T's suggestion), no K-member change needed.    Different radiator, 727 trans, larger torsion bars, front disc brakes, stronger rear end, and under chassis headers (I think TTI has some) are some changes that will have to be made for a good car.    It will cost some dollars for the change, but it can be done. If this is going to be a daily driver I suggest a good small block rather than a big block, better fuel mileage and less front end modifications for a start. You can build a "300 horse at the wheels" small block without breaking the bank.

X6BNLeh0aa	Depends. Some cars store the mileage in the car's computer, so it wont change if you replace the speedo cluster. Other cars store it in the cluster itself, so if you replace it, your mileage will be off. I don't know for sure about a 99 trans am. You might call a dealer to see if they know. I am willing to bet though that this car stores this information in the speedo cluster itself, not the computer.|`|bvCkplELaa	Ugh I am sure it will know the mileage on your car and just change to that.

ef13c48ad14182423ab837ba6c4b4948aa	1969 dodge charger    you can view the pics on  http://www.classicdreamcars.com/69DodgeG...    the detail is as follows:    MAKE/MODEL: Dodge Charger [Road & Track (R/T)]     YEAR: 1969     ENGINE:  The engine of the General Lee was a 426 Hemi, with an Eldebrock torquer intake. Hemi is short for "Hemispherical", an engine design that provides more horsepower than any other V8, including the 440 Magnum. Some Generals had 440 Magnums, but the 426 Hemi was shown in many episodes. The General Lee also had headers with 3" exhausts. It had a street-stock stall converter.     FACTORY: Detroit, Michigan.     TIRES: Racing, black sidewalls.     CARBURETOR: A four-barrel Holly 780 Double-Pumper.     TRANSMISSION:   A Chrysler "Torqueflite" A-727, the most durable automatic tranny ever built. In some episodes, however, a manual transmission was shown.     LICENSE PLATE: Georgia CNH 320.     MODIFICATIONS:  To customize the car for the show, it was stripped down to the bare metal on the outside, the rough spots were sanded thoroughly, and then several coats of specially-mixed paint were applied. All of this work was done right at the studio, where the producers had set up a repair shop just for that purpose. The stock horn was replaced with a special horn that played the first twelve notes of "Dixie".   New manifolds were put in the motor and a special exhaust system was installed; all spark plugs were replaced.   A grill guard is also added, though it probably didn't protect much, knowing the way the General was driven.   The roof of the General Lee was supported by three-point roll bars that helped retain the strength of the metal in the event the car was flipped over during a scene.   The doors were welded shut for structural rigidity and storyline continuity. Of course, some General Lees (there were over 300) had un-welded doors.|`|643ee1269def6ad84a2ad8450e860581aa	"69 Dodge Charger.  What a car!

The steering column in my car messed up, and my car wouldn't even start sometimes. I'm not sure how much it would cost to get it fixed because my uncle fixed it free of charge, but the steering column has a lot of computer and electrical parts in it and doesn't just control the steering of the car. I think I would look into a different car.|`|YZkj6HOUaa	A steering column can "go bad" either because it has seized, or something got too loose or broke. If you don't want to get hurt or killed, or hurt or kill somebody else, have it towed.    This sounds like a major repair, perhaps $500 to $1000, or more. Don't buy the car until you find out exactly what's wrong with the steering, and how much it will cost to fix it.    If the steering wheel is shoved in so that it's really close to the dashboard, don't buy the car. A collapsed steering column is a really really good indication that the car has been in a fairly severe accident.
srGG1pRgaa	You could in theory have a 4 cylinder truck, but I understand your question to mean what are the benefits of a smaller car (such as one that has 4 cylinders) over a large truck (with 8 cylinders)...    Some of the benefits of a small car over a truck:  - Fuel Economy  - 4 cylinder cars are usually sedans, which are friendly for 3 or more passengers, while trucks usually are not.  - They generally make less noise then trucks (quieter)  - They are usually easier to work on (engine wise) and are fun for learning mechanics on.  - They are lower to the ground (less chance of flipping)  - You wont be tempted to go off roading and destroying your car   - They can have greater torque even with the smaller engine (they are lighter, so in a lot of cases, faster then heavy trucks with bigger engines... at least mine is)  - They are fun to do donuts with in the snow.|`|AA11264416	ezra - he didn't say if his truck was old, could be almost new, plus if older then you won't have payments, thats at least $200 less a month    but i hate 4 bangers, i've always had V8 trucks and i'll always have one, i don't care how much gas gets up to, just how i am, i like knowing i have a truck when i need one and that i won't need to ask anybody to use their truck, also like the power, doesn't take me 5 minutes to pass someone, one last thing 4 bangers sound like a dirt bike going down the road and a bumble bee ina  tin can, its annoying, keep the V8 with balls, i have a 98 chevy silverado 4x4 Z-71 with a 5.7L 350, its paid for and i love it|`|39ixfEIraa	well it would most likely be front wheel drive and good in snow/ice...assuming your truck is single cab than u could fit more people in it....and again idk wat kind of truck u have but fixing it could be cheaper....idk i wouldnt go 4 cylinder i like speed|`|c68XWGltaa	what are you going to use the vehicle for?  if the only reason you have a truck is "look cool" then get the car because you're kind of a douche anyways.|`|2oFJIibRaa	cheeper insurance, I dont know what the person under me is talking about, but if you get a honda or a simalar car it will most likely outlast any truck my, my last honda had 275k on it and nothing major ever went wrong with it.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	They accelerate slower.

The diagnosis is part of the cure and the diagnosis at a tire/front end shop is "free". You must be careful though. The last visit to a MIDAS shop they partially disassembled my car and wanted over $700 to repair nonexistent problems!!. Pure rip-off.  They had replaced my front brake pads. The original fronts lasted 96,000 miles and theirs only lasted 28,000 miles until metal-on-metal!      Take it to two or three shops for estimates. Probably a warped rotor that can be re-surfaced. Possible out of balance or bent front wheels  or a tire that has been bashed against a curb. However it could be a worn suspension or steering parts.      If U are not going to repair the car yourself why worry about what the problem is?
dyIyJqauaa	I'm sure you now know that you should never pay for work like that up front before the work has even been started.  A better way would have been to put any money he required into a temporary trust account.  That didn't happen so it seems to me you have a few choices.  One of them would be to simply stop your losses and just walk away and let the body shop have the car. (he may sue you for doing this though) Another would be to take the car, as is and see what you can get for it on the market and yet another would be to insist that he fix the things that still need fixing, whether it involves paying him more money or not.

XLXncQu9aa	I try to stay within the legal limit. Most freeway's or interstates have a legal range between 55-65.  The highest I've seen when I have traveled to other states is 70 mph.  Going faster than the posted speed limit can cause you to run into trouble against the law.  If a state trooper catches you speeding you will receive a heavy fine.  Also there is the risk of an accident the higher your speed on the free way.  I suggest you stay within the legal speed limit posted in your area.

If you have cruise control, that's even better.  That gives you more opportunity to watch out for the crazy drivers.  And it's more fuel efficient.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I live in Saskatchewan, Canada and I drive the Trans Canada Highway quite often at around 85 MPH. The speed limit here is 70 MPH.   Now, I don`t go that fast to be a smart-*** or to make better time. It is just the speed that my car seems most comfortable at and there is very little other traffic on the roads out here so I am putting no one except myself at risk.   I do not speed in town.
MOv9fxjHaa	well, i'd say WRX STI but if your planning on moding it, go with the WRX 2006 bc the engine is the same as the STI just some other things are different (5 speed instead of 6, but it helps you in the long run, 5 speed are always faster than a 6 speed bc of gear ratio) The wrx is really easy to mod, the STI not so much, it's really picky about what you put in it, a cold air intake will actually slow down the car, as well as the wrong kind of exhaust.     SRT-4 is pretty cool too because its front wheel drive, on a roll it will kill all of those cars, from a stop the STI would dominate all of those cars, so really fwd awd and rwd really does make a difference. It just depends on how your going to race. Do you want to launch like a mother and kill anything from a dead stop? Or do you want to be driving already and be able to pick up speed quickly?     Seems like your into the imports but a 2003 Mustang Cobra or Camaro SS are pretty fast, they're both supercharged rwd and will dominate all of the cars you listed on a roll, not so much from a stop.     All depends on what you want in the car

I only had trouble passing the L.A. Smog Tests and some other cosmetic issues.  I had to get rid of it last year but I should have tuned it up and re-test it.
lHLDvVALaa	If you take good care of any car, 150,000+ is no big deal anymore. In most cases, over 200,000 isn't too far fetched.     So, if you have a record of regular maintenance, like oil changes, there's no reason to believe that it won't last you a whole lot longer.     I have an '04 Lincoln LS, and absolutely love it. My Brother-in-law, who has owned, among other things, a Corvette, a BMW, and a Saab, says that he prefers the LS over all of those.     I'd buy it in a minute-$6000 is a good deal, especially for one with that few miles and with a good service record.    EDIT:    If these are so incredibly unreliable, why is it that I looked at several(10+) that had well over 100,000, every one of which still ran perfectly.     Ford quit using the DEW platform because they parted ways with Jaguar. Jaguar is still using it, on the S-type up until last year, as well as on the new XF. They also still uses the AJ-V8 engine(that's also in the LS and T-Bird) in the vast majority of their mid to high end cars.    Ford also based the platform for their new Mustang off of the DEW platform. If it's so horrible, why would they even think about using any part of it for one of their flagship models?    EDIT 2:  I am a 20 year old male, with no accidents or moving violations.     I too was concerned about a spike in insurance prices when I got mine. Surprisingly enough, the increase wasn't shocking at all. I went from a 14-year-old Nissan Maxima with liability only to the 4 year old Lincoln, and full coverage.     Apparently, both because it's four doors and it comes from a maker that doesn't traditionally make sporty cars, the insurance companies don't consider it to be as big of a risk as a more stereotypical sports car.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Nope.    The early years of that car had poor reliability.  That is bad to know (or not know in your case) on such an expensive to maintain car...    There is a myth that all cars last if they are well taken care of, but a car that was poorly designed from the start has no chance.  The T-bird and LS are that example and Ford dumped the DEW98 platform pretty quickly.|`|txoXobsAaa	i would. those are very nice looking cars and pretty fast espcially if you get the v8 version.|`|c28925a42319d47558b135bd8dc66e6daa	Yes thats a pretty good deal and its a great car.|`|2450ec9e6d3869ead0de9bf051683455aa	i have a 2002 lincoln LS V8 and its been a great car with only one major problem. the car drives like if it was on rails..corners like it the road was made for it. when people past you who have one they give you that knowing grin. i have 86,000 on my car.

Some relays do have multiple connections; a relay with two sets of contacts could handle two circuits running at 8 volts each. Someone who didn't understand the difference might then say it was "handling" 16 volts. But, no, it is handling *two* 8 volt circuits.    If you are thinking of trying to connect a relay rated at 8 volts to a 16 volt circuit, don't! You will not only fry the relay, you may fry anything connected to that relay, and there is at least a small chance you will start a fire.|`|AA12239770	relays generally have a specified Coil voltage.

AA12171549	You don't need one, and it's illegal to put one on, anyway. Federal law PROHIBITS the modification of the exhaust system upstream of the catalytic convertor. You aren't even allowed to put on a dual exhaust with dual cats. However, you can put on a bigger pipe, and a high-flow cat, if that makes any sense. (and almost NOTHING an environmentalist ever came up with does.)   A dual exhaust is used on V engines, because there are 2 seperate banks of cylinders. They still need to connect together at some point to equalize pressure between the two pipes. Since you only have one bank of cylinders, it would be pointless to break the exhaust system in two, and then bring them back together again.   Get a good cat-back system. If you have your heart set on the look of those exhaust tips poking out of both sides, get a "2-into-1" system. In that type of setup, you have 1 pipe going from the exhaust manifold, to the cat, and back to a split, where two pipes go to either side of the car. Looks good, sounds good, and keeps you in the good graces of Johnny Law.|`|62a5d4ed010f843dd7508f7c3abd28f5aa	Your best bet is to go to a custom exhaust dealer and have one made.
