Il s'agit donc d'une forme particulire de sexualit de groupe. la notion de nombre est dterminante pour distinguer le gang bang d'autres pratiques de groupe (diffrent du triolisme par exemple). Sans dterminer de nombre de partenaires minimum  cette pratique, on peut considrer que le nombre est atteint lorsque l'individu est seul face  des partenaires multiples (une femme ou un homme pour 5, 10, 15 hommes par exemple), et qu'il est soumis  l'ensemble de ceux-ci. La disproportion "un seul face  tous" est ce qui est symboliquement recherch. Le gang bang se distingue de la partouze, o les individus sont plus mlangs (plusieurs hommes, plusieurs femmes) sans qu'un seul individu soit au centre de l'action|`|CPL7M6kjaa	C'est en fait la thorie du "BIG bang" dont tu parles !

HdIFw10iaa	Looking at the third coordinate: z =1 = 3t+2 or t = -1/3   (for second line parameter).  This gives the point (-17,-1,1).  To verify this point is on the  other line:  4t-1=-17 and t+3=-1 both have solution t = -4 (for the first line parameter.)  It would have been less confusing to use different  letters for each of the parameters.  But the two lines intersect when t = -4 in the first line and   t = -1/3 in the second.    There are a number of ways to find the plane.  I don't know what level math you are at but the normal line to the plane can be found by taking the cross-product of the vectors parallel to the lines: v = (4,1,0) and w =(12,6,3)  v X w = (3,-12,12)  You can use any vector parallel so let n =(1,-4,4)   (multiplying the vector by 1/3)  The point (-17,-1,1) is in the plane so the point-normal form of the equation of the plane is:  (x+17)-4(y+1)+4(z-1)=0 or x-4y+4z = -9|`|LoFeJztxaa	There is no reason the t which parameterizes the first line should be "the same t" as the one that parameterizes the second line.    Since z = 1 for every point on the first line the intersection point (if it exists) must have z = 1.  In the second line z = 3 t +2.  For this to equal 1 we must have t = -1 / 3 in the second line at the intersection point.  Plug this into the second line and get (-17, -1, 1) for the intersection point.  We need to check that the first line also goes through this point.  The z coordinate 1 is fine.  The y coordinate t + 3 is supposed to be -1, implying that t = -4 in line 1 at the intersection point.  Must check that x is OK.  Put t = -4 in the x coordinate 4t -1 getting -17, as it should be.      This proves that the lines intersect at (-17, -1, 1) and this point  occurs when t = -4 in line 1 and when t = -1 / 3 in line 2.    There are a variety of ways to find the equation of the plane.  For example you could find a normal vector using a cross product.   I'll let you finish.|`|56O9aaEhaa	At the point of intersection, z = 1; using z = 3t + 2, we find that t (for the second line) is -1/3, giving x = -17 and y = -1.  It is trivial to show that the first line also includes (-17,-1,1) for t = -4.    The plane can be written as a linear combination of the vectors added to the common point:  (-17,-1,1) + u + v  (and of course the second vector can be reduced to )

The substances which react in a reaction always have positive and a negative ion. Always the negative part reacts with the positive and the positive reacts with the negative.     For eg. in    H2SO4 , H is the positive ion and SO4 is the negative ion.    In the reaction with CaOH follow rule no. 2 of the properties of acidic reactions.    H2SO4 (aq) +CaOH(aq)  reacts into CaSO4 (aq)+ H2O(l)    So positive part of H2SO4 reacts with the negative part of CaOH and forms H20 (l)    And the negative part of H2SO4reacts with the positive part of CaOH and forms CaSO4.

One such fraction is (1+3)/(1+3)  If you multiply your fraction by this, you get:  2(1+ 3)/[(1- 3)*(1+ 3)]  = 2(1+3)/(12-32)  = 2(1+ 3)/(1-3)  = 2(1+3)/(-2)  = -3 - 1

Check out this youtube for a video on this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lohKLYbZp...  |`|Mj98IsGZaa	i've had this question before, its rather simple, what you could do is light a splint then blow it out again (so it is merely glowing) then get a test tube of oxygen upside down and put the glowing splint in and since that it is pure oxygen it should relight the splint!    hope this is the answer you wanted, good luck!|`|4GqmuoxYaa	the glowing splint (like an ember - not on fire just yet) when exposed to oxygen becomes on fire - with flames! oxygen encoursges fire to happen.|`|X8uAa3Ghaa	Fire needs oxygen.

The test she is talking about is that fire needs oxygen to burn and work.  if you take a splint of wood on fire and place it in a jar and it goes out, their is no O2 in the jar, if it stays lite then you have O2.  The splint supplies the fuel so it just needs  the O2 to burn.  Make sure you dont put it in a jar with another fuel, that is how explosions can happen!  They are fun too but not with glass jars!|`|xuHxSBcQaa	ok,  so basically you light a splint, then blow it out, so that it is still glowing red.  then you stick in in the place you want to test for oxygen and see if it relights (fire needs oxygen you see)    so the test is to see if a glowing splint relights in the gas you are trying to test.  : )

Remember you can multiply things in any order, so    = -8 *  8 * 25 * x^3 * x^2 * y^3 * y^6  = -1600x^5y^9    5. For this one, you take out the common factors top and bottom.  Ignoring the squaring for now:    4* x^5 * y^2  ------------------  -2 * x^3 * y^2    Can you see that the y^2 on top and bottom cancel out?    4 * x^5  ------------------  -2 * x^3    Now look at the numbers. we have 4/-2    -2 * x^5  -----------  x^3    Now the x's: x^5/x^3 = x^(5-3) = x^2    So, the simplified fraction is  -2x^2    If we square that, we get 4x^4

20918a0f6121f10df613d718cd2c4b08aa	A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.The white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow. This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum. The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths. The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between. The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.|`|XcwCV7Cvaa	I agree with the Sin gurl...  The sky is blue because the sunlight is dispersed into blue light by the fine particles of dust in the air, much like shining sunlight through a glass prism.

This provides protection to the organism by preventing harmful pathogens to invade it through the skin.    The formation of this tight junction also enables quick signalling between the cells, so a break in the layer sends signals to the immune system and coagulating (clotting) system that a break has happened and that it needs to be sealed and an immune response mounted against pathogens which enter through the fissure.|`|mIUEhLMGaa	this for homework?|`|gYERuKQyaa	the organism may feel more comfortable|`|sgMadWAbaa	Think about the main purpose of skin - to keep stuff in, and other stuff out. it wouldn't be a very effective barrier if there were big gaps in between the cells so they have to be tight knit to serve their purpose.

Anche per i Cinesi il tre  perfetto, perch numero della totalit cosmica: cielo, terra, uomo. Ma al tre sono stati attribuiti significati magici e simbolici da tutte le civilt e in tutte le epoche. Nelle religioni, sono frequenti le triadi divine, dalla Trimurti induista (Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu) alla Trinit del Cristianesimo. Filone DAlessandria (I secolo dopo Cristo) voleva spiegarne la sacralit e la perfezione con le tre dimensioni degli oggetti. Da qui la sua importanza durante il Medioevo, basti pensare alla Divina Commedia, dove il tre e i suoi multipli hanno un valore simbolico (tre cantiche, trentatr canti, nove gironi infernali).|`|JpD51Yhcaa	il tre perch se io faccio delle domande a cui devi rispondere ad un quesito vedi  naturale che viene pi spontanea  plausibile andare a colpo sicuro  esclusione che una delle tre  quella giusta ciaooo|`|Dnds1Ny2aa	13 mi porta sfiga ma mi piace

2lQ8DJAcaa	1 - Stars are classified by their temperature, which will affect their colour. The stars range in colour from red through yellow and white to blue. The Sun’s yellow surface is about 5800K (Kelvin), while some red stars are 3000K and blue stars can have surface temperatures of over <br>  30000K.<br>  <br>  2 - A spectrograph/a spectrometer<br>  The spectrum of a star can tell us the surface temperature of that star.<br>  <br>  3 - One of the most important properties of the H-R diagram is that it lets us trace the lives of the stars. A ball of gas officially becomes a star at the moment that nuclear fusion reactions begin in its core, converting hydrogen to helium. At the point the star is a brand-new main sequence object, and lies at the lower boundary of the main sequence strip. Sensibly enough, this is called the zero-age main sequence, or ZAMS.<br>  As a star ages, it gradually gets brighter. This means the star moves upward on the H-R diagram, because it is getting more luminous. That is why the main sequence is a band and not just a line: different stars of a given spectral type are different ages and have slightly different luminosities.<br>  <br>  4 - If the star is larger it could appear brighter or if it is closer than the one that is hotter|`|lNyZ4ZN2aa	1: From coolest to hottest, stars appear red, orange, yellow, white, and blue.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_cla...</a><br>  <br>  2: Astronomers use a spectrograph.  The spectrum of a star gives a lot of detail about its physical characteristics, motion, and chemical composition.<br>  <br>  3: The H-R Diagram plots luminosity vs. temperature.  It helps us understand stellar evolution. <br>  <br>  4: Can be because of mass, the more massive it is the more luminous.  Also, distance can be a factor for apparent magnitude.|`|RknydzkZaa	1.  A star acts as a blackbody.  Hot stars emit more light in the blue end of the spectrum and cooler stars emit more light in the red part of the spectrum.<br>  <br>  2. The astronomer uses a spectrograph.  These usually consist of a grating that splits the light into colours and is recorded on a detector (a CCD).  The spectrum allows you to measure the effective temperature, relative abundances of atoms in the photosphere, the speed at which the star is spinning,  the relative speed the star is moving away/towards us, the gravity at the photosphere and much more.<br>  <br>  3. The HR diagram is a plot of spectral type (temperature) versus absolute brightness (luminosity).  These two quantities are related to the mass and age of the star.<br>  <br>  4. The Luminosity of a star is related to its radius.  A larger star (blackbody) will be more Luminous.|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	1. the colors of stars are given by the color their gasses burn. hotter stars are more blue/white and cooler stars are more red/orange. <br>  <br>  2. Spectrometer. From "spectro" meaning spectrum and "meter" meaning measuring device.<br>  <br>  A telescope only sees visible light from a star. To see the chemical composition of the star's atmosphere and to see if the star is moving towards or away from us (and how fast) the astronomer passes the visible light through a spectrometer.

Te explico el origen:    Procede del alfabeto fenicio, segn puede deducirse de lo siguiente:    1o) Existe gran semejanza entre los signos griegos y fenicios, especialmente en las ms antiguas inscripciones griegas.     2o) La ordenacin de las letras es igual. Si bien no conocemos directamente la del fenicio, s la del hebreo, lengua vecina emparentada con l.    3o) Los signos tienen aproximadamente el mismo valor fontico.    4o) Los nombres de las letras son tambin muy parecidos. Estos nombres no nos han sido trasmitidos por el fenicio, pero s por el hebreo.  Adems, los propios griegos tenan conciencia de que el alfabeto que ellos empleaban derivaba del fenicio. Dice Herdoto en sus Historias (V,58):    (...) los fenicios llegados con Cadmo  (...) introdujeron entre los griegos muchos conocimientos, entre otros, el de las letras, que los griegos, en mi opinin, no posean con anterioridad; (...) las dieron a conocer bajo el nombre de 'signos fenicios'.    Tambin la direccin de la escritura era originariamente en griego de derecha a izquierda, igual que en semita. Posteriormente se escribi de izquierda a derecha y de derecha a izquierda alternativamente. Recin a partir del siglo V a. C. la escritura se orient de izquierda a derecha.

XKbJmTdDaa	Nothing.    The answer would be as close to nothing as possible (lim-->0)    If:  (1) in your reasoning is the whole and (2) are the parts of the whole.    Then:  the absolute value of the parts is greater than that of the whole.  (example:  If there are three parts to a puzzle then there are three parts and one puzzle... 3>1)    You are wanting to divide (1) by (2) as each number approaches infinity.    Because (2) will naturally be larger than (1); the bottom part of the equation will grow larger (go to infinity) faster than the top part.    Therefore:  The fraction will be getting smaller and smaller as the numbers grow larger, approaching but never reaching zero.|`|uOPTcp7faa	the answer is simple, anything divided by itself is 1!|`|1325d62443b21968b7054bdeac4b52b6aa	The reason that it is undefined is because infinity is not a number, its a concept.

The extent of everything is not infinite. The Universe, according to the current model, is a closed system that has a finite amount of mass and energy contained within it.    Within any arbitrary object, there are a finite number of particles that make it up (its atoms), and a finite number of particles that make up these atoms. This is why all material objects have a finite, measurable mass, and a finite, measurable internal energy.    You can divide any physical quantity by any other arbitrary physical quantity and obtain a numerical value, but the meaning of this number can be obscure without context.    You can define the mass of the Universe (Mu) and the number of particles in the Universe (Pu) in units that give Mu/Pu = 1 as the answer, but this is just because of the choice of units.

Whether it is Biological, chemical or explosive.|`|AA10132204	It sounds like someone is mixing their systems.  An NFPA fire diamond should not have a B in the white part.  That system is part of the HMIS system which is a rectangle instead of a diamond, but also has the red, blue, and yellow sections.      Interestingly, you have found a glitch in the systems used (or at least most peoples understanding).  A "B" designates that goggles and gloves should be worn when handling the product on a "non-consumer" or industrial scale.  Kind of dumb for hand soap, but understand that rating is based on someone handling say on a 55 or 1000 gallon scale, not someone washing their hands.  You will find that almost all products sold in a hardware store and grocery store will have at least that rating (A being the least hazardous and K and X being the most) when sold on a large scale.    You mention the MSDSs in a school.  Each state and country will be different, but most schools will be exempt from the requirement to have them on "consumer" products.  If they do have them, they will be for the information of the workers such as custodial staff and maintenance, not students because students are not employees.  You should ask in the main office where they are kept if interested.  They may be in the administration building, principal's office, or maintenance office.  Remember, most "consumer" products do not require a MSDS.    The reference is a good link to the labeling.|`|STMM2ACcaa	Not exactly sure where the "B" is you're looking at but Hazmat refers to specific levels of clothing to protect against chemicals.  Level "B" would be similar to a Tyvek suit and may or may not be airtight and could be worn with a SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus), gloves, face shield etc. Another "B" used in Hazmat is the TIH (Toxic to/in humans) level.  I don't recall what the ppm threshold is at that level but a level B is more toxic than "C" or "D".  "A" of coarse having the highest toxicity.

5M2teBdyaa	Nuclear fission is basically where you have a neutron that is propelled toward the nucleus of a heavy atom, usually Uranium-235.  The neutron will split the nucleus into lighter elements and will in turn propel several neutrons forward to strike and split other nuclei, starting a chain reaction.    The best way to picture the reaction is very much like a pool table.  The balls that are racked on the far end of the table are like the nucleus of the Uranium atom.  The cue ball would be the neutron that you're shooting at the nucleus.  The pool balls scatter when struck by the cue ball, those would be the neutrons released by splitting the atom into it's lighter elements.    In nuclear reactors the reaction is tightly controlled usually they'll use neutron absorbing control rods such as cadmium to keep the reaction from getting out of hand and happening too quickly and generating too much heat.      Though if a reactor does generate too much heat there's no possiblity of it generating a nuclear blast.  The fuel they use is far too dilute for that to happen.  It would get hot enough to cause a meltdown and be a disaster, but it wouldn't explode.      The systems are also water cooled, as the process generates lots of heat and the steam is used to power turbines which provide the electricity that people get from nuclear power plants.    I hope the explanation isn't too long for you, but that's the best way I can explain it.|`|575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	splitting the nucleus of a heavy atom.

If this was early in the evening and was in the southwest, it was probably Jupiter, with the unusual red colour coming from its low altitude, but there are other possibilities which can't be ruled out with the limited information you've given us.    [Edit] Not much in the northeast around midnight. In the southeast, you would see Sirius, or in the east, Procyon. Jupiter sets around 8:30 p.m. at present, so it couldn't be Jupiter. Mars is downright silly as an answer, since it's currently on the far side of the Sun and totally invisible from Earth!

s4yAAxAZaa	Check the "delayed choice quantum eraser" experiment.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_cho...    First, it is not your observing the result, that collapses the probability wave, the simple act of detecting which slit the electron went through, collapses the probability wave. As long as the information about which slit the electron went through is stored somewhere, the interference pattern will disappear. So whether or not you look at the results, makes absolutely no difference. Many people are under the mistaken impression that an observer has to see the results, in order to collapse the wave, but this simply isn't true. A simple entangled particle is a sufficient observer to collapse the wave.

mmWeBRRtaa	Geez, Tick Tock, your question gave me a headache when I first read it, but I think I understand the situation now.    Obviously, Rayleign scattering does work in both directions.    I think the key thing is this:  Astronomers sometimes use the terms "optically thin" and "optically thick."  For example, suppose you look down the street on a very foggy morning.  There's a stop sign at the end of the block, but it's not visible at all.  The light from it is completely scattered, and the light that reaches your eye contains no information about the sign.  The fog between you and the sign is optically thick.    But as you walk down the block, the sign starts appearing out of the mist, and becomes more and more distinct as you get closer.  The fog is now optically thin (or, at least, optically not so thick).    Now instead of the fog, imagine looking at the sky on a sunny afternoon.  The entire sky is somewhat bright (bright enough to blot out the stars) because of scattered light from the sun.  Despite this scattering, however, you can see the sun very clearly.  You can see a sharp edge and sunspots or prominences (with the proper instruments), and it's obvious that the sun is immensely brighter than the surrounding sky.    In the sunny-sky situation, the scattering is noticeable, but far too small to obscure the sun.  (I'm not even talking about the wavelength dependence of the scattering here, but just the scattering in general.)  If the scattering were optically thick, there would be no difference in brightness between the sun and the surrounding regions (as is the case in heavy overcast).  There is, in fact, a huge difference, so the scattering is really rather small.  (The only reason we see the scattered light at all is that the sun is really bright.  We don't notice this scattering at night, even with a full moon, except in the sense that the Milky Way and the fainter stars disappear throughout the sky.)  We can say that scattering in the atmosphere is optically thin, and it allows us to see features beyond the atmosphere.    Optical thickness (or thinness) is symmetric.  The scattering is also optically thin to an astronaut looking down on earth from space.  There is Rayleigh scattering, and it does have some effect (such as the blue tinge on the photo linked by Adam), but it's not enough to block the view of earth from space, just as it doesn't block the view of the sun from earth.    One more thing:  Even though Rayleigh scattering affects blue light much more than red, it by no means scatters all of the blue light.  That's why Newton saw light of all colors (including blue) when he directed sunlight through a prism, and that's why you see blue light in the inner edge of a rainbow.  That's also why you can see the great yellow and blue pairing when you look at the double star Albireo (Beta Cygni) through a telescope; some of the blue light gets preferentially scattered, but much of it gets through undisturbed.|`|QPWjtDzcaa	The earth's surface is composed more of stuff that reflects light, rather than scatters it.|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	dagnabit its the fourth power of the wavelengths|`|y94EOAnLaa	Is the blue you see from the reflection of the Earth of is it a reflection of the total black of space?|`|AA10543440	The sky is blue during the daytime (on a clear day) because the atmosphere disperses shorter wavelengths more than red ones, meaning the bluer light gets scattered more.  Looking down, there are things to see (continents with deserts, forests and cities, oceans and islands and icebergs, and so on) and although there is some Raleigh scattering of the light reflecting from these objects, you still see them.  Photos from space that include the earth's horizon show the scattering of blue light still happens as seen from above.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	I think one answerer got close.

bl1lLDd1aa	The vertical component (Vy) of velocity is found by the following;    Vy= Vsin(52.0)=18.1sin(52.0)= 14.3 m/s    The horizontal component (Vx) iw found by the following;    Vx=Vcos(52.0)=18.1(cos(52.0))=11.1 m/s.    The time in the air before the ball passes the crossbar is found by the following;    distance= velocity*time  26.0 m = 11.1 m/s* time    time= 2.3 sec    We will find how high the ball goes and then what its height will be after it has been in the air for 2.3 seconds.    velocity= initial velocity - accel of gracity*time    When the ball peaks velocity is zero. Therefore;    0= 14.3-9.81t    t=1.5 sec    the max height happends at 1.45 sec    distance=Vy*t-1.2 accel*time^2    distance=14.3*1.5-9.81(1.5)^2=10.4 meters    It will fall  while traveling forward for the remaining 0.88 sec.    The distance is found by the following equation;    distance=Vy*t-1.2 accel*time^2    However, the initial velocity is zero at this point. So the distance down is ;    distance= -1/2 accel of gravit*time^2=-1/2(9.81)(0.88)^2= 8.6 m    The ball will be at the following height when it passes the cross bar;    10.4-8.6= 1.7 meters    It fails to cross by a distance of -1.3 meters.    b) The verticle speed is what it will be after falling 0.88 sec from an inital velocity of zero;    velocity= -9.81*t=-9.81(0.88)    velocity=-8.6 m/s

Marinol, a synthetic form of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, as well as appetite loss caused by AIDS.

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	e  ---    It was imagined when a theory was formulated (1984) to try and explain an apparent cycle in the major extinctions on Earth.  A brown dwarf in a 26,000,000 year orbit around the Sun would come close enough to the Oort cloud to disrupt the tranquil existence of the ice lumps in slow orbits.  Some would "drop" to the inner solar system in large enough numbers to make life on Earth miserable (from the large number of collisions).  Many animals would die off during the "dust winters" that followed the collisions.    The theory was shown to be weak on a few counts:  for example, the apparent cycle of extinctions was false, newer infrared telescopes failed to find it (and yet, we find brown dwarfs thousand of light-years away).    However, not all astronomers have given up on it.  Nemesis is still considered hypothetical, because it could be even smaller than expected.  Even at that, it should be detectable by the next generation of automated tracking telescopes (e.g., PAN-STARR).    The original calculations do provide a general area where to look.      If Nemesis really existed, it would be on its way out, towards aphelion, and would come back in "only" 15 million years (or so).    Will we be ready?|`|AA10543440	Huh?

Astronomers look back in time to find quasars, so they are very distant, 14 billion light years away.    Quasars are very energetic, being composed of a hyper black hole with the gravity of 18 billion suns associated with it around which in falling gas and matter is swirling in orbit and falling in.    They are also very puzzling, giving off jets of gaseous matter and collecting more matter to feed upon. Why do we only find them in existences so long ago and not in the present. Or, is the super black hole at the heart of the Milky Way Galaxy just a small quasar at the present time, which is equivalent to saying 26,000 years ago?    To say that any of these facets are applicable to quasers is just plain silly, so answer e. is not applicable.|`|WNAW7nZYaa	energetic

If we draw an equilateral triangle drop down a line from the highest point to the base, called the altitude (height), that is all the critical information we need to solve the problem. Things to note: 1) A triangle has 180 degree total, hence one of the base angles is 60 degrees, and 2) The hypotenuse of the right triangle is twice the length of one of the sides. DRAW A PICTURE.    What are we trying to find? The area. The area of a triangle is 1/2 base times height. What is the length of the base? Note: the hypotenuse is exactly the same length as the side of the equilateral triangle.    There is a couple of approaches we can take at this time find the base s. Sides of triangle: 2*root3, 1/2s, s.  First method. Pythagorean Theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2  [(1/2)s]^2 + [2*root3]^2 = s^2   ==>  (1/4)s^2 + 4(3) = s^2                                                   ==> 12 = (3/4)s^2 (collect like terms)                                                   ==> 12(4/3) =s^2                                                   ==> 16 = s^2 ==> s = 4 cm  Second approach Sin 60 = opposite/hypotenuse=(2*root3) /s  In a standardized triangle the sin 60 = (root3)/2.  So, (root3)/2 = (2*root3)/s. Dive by root3, yields 1/2 =2/s. Thus s=4 cm.  Area =(1/2)(4 cm)*(2*root3 cm) = 4*root 3 square cm.

eUgwHzeqaa	Well, first, if it's in urine, it isn't in the blood.  Usually we don't talk about blood "protein"--usually the one thing we look at is the albumin level, which is the main protein found in blood.  It is a protein produced by the liver and it's very important in maintaining osmotic pressure in the vasculature and in carrying certain other molecules through the bloodstream.    Protein generally shouldn't be in the urine.  Gross protein in urine is often albumin, too, but if it appears it means that the kidneys aren't doing their job properly, because it's supposed to be filtered out of the urine and kept in the blood where it belongs.  There are other kinds of proteins that can appear in the urine, and other than hCG (which appears in the urine of pregnant women), most of them are signs of something being wrong.  What is wrong depends on what kind of protein it is.  Probably the most common cause of proteinuria is diabetes (renal experts, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).    Having blathered on about all that, yes, the protein count in the urine is usually reported in grams per liter.  (You don't have to produce a liter, they extrapolate from whatever they have, but in some conditions where they're looking for rarer proteins called hormones, they may do a 24-hour urine collection and really look at all of it.)|`|nazDwz0waa	Uh i dont think so.

AA10455671	It depends on what you mean by "rely heavier."  The US has 104 active nuclear power plants.  This is the most of any country in the world.  However, the output of these plants is only about 20% of the total electrical production in the U.S.    The U.S. does not rely more on nuclear power due to a variety of issues.  First, the U.S. has huge reserves of coal.  Because we have so much coal, it is cheap and is perceived as "easier" than nuclear.  Certainly it is easier to get a new plant built.    Second, the U.S. is a capitalist society.  Nuclear power must compete against other methods of producing electricity.  Other countries, such as France, who get more of their electricity from nuclear are socialist countries and the government owns the nuclear plants.  In this environment, the government decides that it is in the best interest of the country to have a lot of nuclear power.  Issues such as cost and public opinion are not as significant.    Third, in the late 70s and early 80s many nuclear power plants were undergoing construction but kept running into legal or regulatory problems.  Some of this was made worse by the 1979 partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor.  These construction problems sometimes resulted in losing billions of dollars.  The money people were not happy to lose that much money and ended up pulling the plug on many unfinished plants or changing them from nuclear to natural gas or coal.    Fourth, at the same time as these money issues started happening, the U.S. entered into an economic slowdown.  The electrical demand that was predicted in the 60s and 70s did not materialize.  This may have been partly to do with conservation efforts that began in the 70s.  Without demand to drive construction, the money people weren't willing to fund or continue to fund such risky and expensive projects.  To the money people, the risk in loaning a company $1 billion to build a coal plant that was almost guaranteed to see successful operation was much less than the risk in loaning $3 billion to a company to build a nuclear plant that might never see operation.  Also, that coal plant could start operation within three years.  A nuclear plant takes at least twice that long.    A few nuclear plants that were started in the 70s or 80s did not see successful operation until well into the 90s.  Today, all of these same issues are at work with varying levels of importance.  The only additional factor is the issue of used nuclear fuel.  The used fuel is highly radioactive because the fission products of uranium have much SHORTER half-lives.  (This is contrary to what another poster said incorrectly about fission products.)  However, we have the technology and knowledge to safely handle this dangerous material without adversely impacting the safety of workers or the public.  Unfortunately, this issue has become a political issue for the current Democratic leader of the Senate, Mr. Harry Reid of Nevada who has made it his life's mission to block construction of the Yucca Mountain Repository.    So, in short, the U.S. doesn't rely more heavily on nuclear power because we lack the will or the intelligence to do so.|`|DQT5ZDSPaa	You should look into the partial core meltdown that occurred at Three Mile Island in 1979.  It helped to turned public opinion in the US against nuclear power plants and all new plant construction stopped shortly after.  They are only now starting to build new plants.  Other countries (most notably France) didn't have this kind of backlash.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Fear of their enemy.|`|Ai7O5hiBaa	Some countries with a smaller army need a bigger threat than they have, right now nuclear power is all the rage.

This was a direct result of knee-jerk legislation changes after the Three-Mile Island accident. Therefore, everyone else has built more and we've stayed the same.     Since we needed more power, we built more fossil fuel power plants (coal, natural gas, oil.) EPA restrictions are still incredibly strict towards new nuclear plant construction, mostly because we have nowhere to store the waste.     As a side note, the products of nuclear fission of Uranium 235 (being Plutonium) are more radioactive and have a much longer half-life than the U-235 did. The end result: you have highly radioactive waste that has to be stored somewhere. Even though Yucca Mountain was constructed specifically for the storage of nuclear waste, it is not in use because people don't want waste there, but also because of the transportation problems associated with getting the waste to the site. Trucks and trains are not the safest place for radioactive waste.     Also, other countries have fewer restrictions on the proliferation of nuclear energy.     Something important to note is that all of the nuclear power plants in the United States are nearing the end of their life spans, and will need replacing. Construction of new power plants is currently in the planning phase... we should have a few more plants starting up in a decade or so.|`|Ezr0af8Vaa	Some countries rely more heavily on nuclear power because they don't have resources available to generate power such as coal, oil and natural gas.  For some countries, these natural resources are simply not available.  For example, Japan has no easily available coal and oil deposits.  Therefore, they rely heavily on importing these resources.  However, importation can be very expensive and also makes Japan venerable to blockades and potentially blackmail.  To be self-sustaining and self-reliant on energy, they turn to nuclear.  In the US, for example, there is hundreds of years of retrievable coal, (fewer years) oil and natural gas.  Therefore, the US is less reluctant to take on the (slight) additional risk of nuclear power.

52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	I was reading a book recently on the Ted Bundy murders, and one of the detectives made a very profound observation that went something like this: "A good detective has to keep an open mind at all times, and not discount any possibilities." The same goes for scientists.    Radiometric dating is based on the known and constant radioactive decay rates of various radioisotopes including carbon (14), uranium (238), and potassium (40). This decay is a very sound and accepted fundamental aspect of physics, and therefore the dating is very reliable, routinely to within 1%.    C-14 has a half-life of 5730 years, therefore C-14 dating is useful for ages from a few hundred to a few tens of thousands of years. Other radioactive isotopes work better for geological materials older than that.     The radioactive decay rate (or half life) has been established for all naturally occurring radioisotopes to well within 1% accuracy, and that rate is not disputable. The concentrations of various isotopes in geological and archeological samples can be determined by mass spectrometry to well within 1%, and that accuracy is not disputable.    The problems in any type of radiometric dating is to be certain that the ratio of parent isotope to daughter product has not been altered by some external method such as natural or human contamination or loss of the daughter product. The accuracy can be determined mathematically when multiple data sets from multiple samples, and even multiple methods, are obtained. Therefore, radiometric dates will almost certainly be accompanied by a "+/-" notation giving the reliability of the data. The more samples are collected and analyzed, and the closer they are to each other, the higher the level of certainty is on the resulting data. Not all materials can be reliably tested, but of those that are, the results are beyond any reasonable doubt.    Radiocarbon dating can be reliably compared to known dates such as tree rings, and in fact, that type of work has resulted in establishing that the amount of C-14 in the atmosphhere has not been constant.  A calibration curve has been established to improve the level of accuracy.    Of course, there are religious nutcakes out there who refuse to believe scientific facts for their own agenda, and they desperately grasp at minor flaws to satisfy their own egos. Those are commonly the same people who don't believe in gravity or a round earth, and they are welcome to believe what they want. It goes back to keeping an open mind, and therefore it has nothing to do with creationism or evolutionism.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It is based upon a considerable body of physics research.  In the scientific community, techniques like radiocarbon dating do not reach widespread acceptance until many experiments from many different angles have been done to verify that the technique is sound. Scientists are really hard on each other, not allowing unsupported conclusions or shoddy data. (you may hear exceptions, but usually these are in profit motive situations, and not usually out of the universities).  Many, many elements are radioactive, and most of these elements have been observed decaying in the same logarithmic pattern.  There are dating techniques that are done the same for objects of historical age, using different radioactive elements, and those ages were able to be verified since these were preserved artifacts (such as out of the Vatican).|`|uOqk7PzGaa	First of all, there are NO scientific beliefs. That does not exist. Science does not require "beliefs", it stands on physical evidence. So "scientific beliefs" is an oxymoron.     The answer is yes, radiocarbon is credible and reliable and you can rely on it as much as you rely on everything that technology has produced. If radiocarbon dating wasn't true, then there would not be any nuclear bombs as the same principles apply.|`|AWPaPV4Eaa	It isn't quite as straightforward as you learn in science class, because the concentration of C14 in the atmosphere has not been constant throughout the useful range of radiocarbon dating.  Some of the more recent changes include the addition of large amounts of stable carbon from the burning of fossil fuels (which have been sitting underground for so long that all of their C14 has decayed) and a large increase in C14 in the 1950s and 60s due to atmospheric nuclear testing.    Scientists must produce a calibration curve to account for this, and do so by examining other sources.  These include tree rings, sediments, and when available, historical documents.  When properly calibrated, radiocarbon dating produces accurate measurements and is based on basic mathematical and physical principles.|`|aab30902c32aa18d4eeead9019224c2aaa	Yep, as long as there is some biological material to date.  It's not exact, partly because of the amount of change in atmospheric carbon compounds, but it is close.  Google radiocarbon dating if you want more info and a more complete explanation.    This is so well known and accepted that I wonder why you are questioning it.|`|mV1YscV7aa	No, it is not credible.    To start with, the amount of radio-active material present within the rock at the time of its formation cannot be known.    The amount of daughter element / isotope at the time of its formation cannot be known.    The amount of daughter element of another element along the decomposing pathway that have defused out of the system, especially where these elements are gases such as argon, radon or nitrogen, cannot be known.    Carbon 14 is considered to have a half-life of 5,730 years. An item 50,000 years old would contain so little C 14 that it should be unmeasurable. This is why for geological purposes, rather than archaeological purposes, C 14 dating is not normally used.    WHY has Carbon 14 been found in geological material that is supposedly 200 million years old or older giving a C 14 value of 33,720 years old (see links below)??? Are these creationists lying? Such behaviour is highly unlikely as it would go against Christian ethics.    Georock - why are you so disingenuous? Quote "Those are commonly the same people who don't believe in gravity or a round earth." Nothing of the kind! How would I have got through a geology degree if I didn't believe in gravity or an oblate spheroidal earth?     I challenge EVERYONE to examine the facts - certain researchers are hiding behind lies!

HTmj2BXDaa	You should probably trace the wires to find out.  If the line has a short but there is enough resistance in the short so that it does not draw enough amps to trip the circuit breaker, it will act as a resistance heater.  It is also possible for an old circuit breaker to go bad and not trip the way it should.  If the circuit is in the wall or between floors, or in the attic or in any finished space, it could potentially start a fire.      Tracing this could be rather difficult.  It depends on where the switch is.  If your basement is not finished and the main power panel is in the basement, you may be able to trace some of it there.  Some electricians have meters that inductively measure the current flowing in a wire.  If the current is high but not high enough to trip the breaker, you may be able to feel heat on the breaker panel (do not open the inside of the breaker panel because, even with all the breakers off, there is still live wires inside that panel).     Probably a good idea to hire an electrician.  You may want to remove the switch or disconnect this circuit at the breaker box.|`|AA11148143	In the meantime, put tape or a sign or something on that switch to made sure it stays off. I guess if it were going to start a fire it already would have, but still...

GgX1iEJDaa	If you want an orthogonal vector, get a cross-product, which is the determinant of a matrix with i, j, and k in the first row; a in the second row; and b in the third row.    ( . used in the matrix below for text spacing only )    a  b =      | .i .j .k |  | 4 -2 2 | = [ (-2)(5) - (2)(3) ]i - [ (4)(5) - (2)(-2) ]j + [ (4)(3) - (-2)(-2) ]k  | -2 3 5 |    = ( -10 - 6 )i - ( 20 + 4 )j + ( 12 - 4 )k  = -16i - 24j + 8k    Find the unit vecor of this by dividing by its magnitude. If you want, you may divide by a scalar value first to make it smaller without changing its direction (so the next part uses smaller numbers:     ( -16i - 24 j + 8k ) / 8  = -2i - 3j + k    Magnitude:  [ (-2)2 + (-3)2 + (1)2 ]  = ( 4 + 9 + 1 )  = ( 14 )     ( -2i - 3j + k )/( 14 )  -2/(14) i - 3/(14) j + 1//(14) k    The other vector would just be the negative of this.    Answer:  -2/(14) i - 3/(14) j + 1//(14) k  2/(14) i + 3/(14) j - 1//(14) k    [ A way to check: Get the dot product of this with either of the original vectors they will give you zero. ]|`|k3cmetWRaa	This question comes from Calculus 3 ( Vector Calculus)    A = [4 -2 2]  B = [ -2 3 5]    When you hear the word orgthoganal think perpendicular.  In other words we are finding the vector which is normal to a plane.  To create this plane we must take the cross-product    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_produ...    Take the cross product  A x B    To find the cross product multiply both vectors    det  {     I J K  [ a b c]  [ d e f]    }     = (bf - ce) I + (cd - af)J + (ae - bd)K    Now lets try it using our vectors    [ 4 -2 2]  [-2 3 5]    ( (-2)(5) - (2)(3) ) I + ( (2)(-2) - (4)(5) )J + ( (4)(3) - (-2)(-2) ) K    ( -10 - 6) I + (-4 - 20) J + (12 - 4) K    (-16) I + (-24) J + (8) K    So our orthoganal vector (Normal) is    N = [ -16 -24 8]    At this point we can use the orthoganal vector to solve for the unit vectors.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector    N = N / || N ||    where    || N || = The magnitude of N    A magnitude, if you remember is the distance formula  || N || = ( x2 + y2 + z2)    So, let's determine the magnitude of our orthoganal vector  N = [ -16 -24 8]  || N || = ( (-16)2 +(-24)2 + (8)2 )  || N || =  ( 896)  || N  || = 814    To determine a unit vector we simply normalize it by dividing by the orthoganl magnitude     ^  N = N / | N |    ^  N = [ -16 -24 8]  / 814 =    = [ - 2 /14 -3/14  1/14 ]   = [ -0.534 -0.802 0.267]      Because this vector is orthoganal to the plane.  There is an antinormal ( -u) which is in the exact opposite direction.    To find this just switch the signs.  [ 0.534 0.802 -0.267]

Create two columns like below:    1________500  1.25______400  1.5_______333  ....etc.    Mark the two columns by holding down the left mouse button and dragging over all data, then click the graph icon.  Made an xy Scatter chart.  For chart sub-type, pick one that has lines inteconnecting the dots (bottom right one is my preference).  You can pretty it up by right clicking on the chart and selecting "chart options" and "format chart area" and do various things, like changing the color, adding titles and axis labels, etc.    If you don't have Excel, you could certainly create an x-y graph by hand on graph paper.  I wold plot pressure on the x axis, and volume on the y axis.    To answer the question:    As pressure goes up, volume goes down, so they are inversely proportional.

XZqn21c8aa	The celestial sphere (sky) is divided up into 88 regions called constellations.  The star patterns we commonly refer to as constellations, such as Orion or Ursa Major, are more properly termed asterisms within their respective constellation.    The constellations fit together across the sky, edge to edge, like a jig-saw puzzle, with no gaps in between.  Therefore, any stars observed, at any time, belong to the constellation of that region of the sky.  This includes those observed during a Lunar Eclipse.    So, the short answer is "b".|`|aGLAt8tpaa	b

If by that you mean start from scratch, just a bunch of atoms, building a viable plant without using templates, then it sure seems impossible to me with our current tools.  Living things are extremely complex and have gone through billions of years of evolution.  Furthermore, our control over very small things like atoms is very indirect.  We need to move other things (like making a solution more acidic) which changes properties which have a known effect.  We can't just pick up an atom, put it next to another, then make them form a bond.  However, the more we research, the more we learn about how to use what is available to us, the more power we will have over the stuff in our universe.|`|cXb7Eucjaa	if by artificially created u mean genetically engineered yes they can a scientist can take an existing plant and change the genes to what ever they desire. also selective breading can be a form of artificial creation bcuz it is not natural.    artificial:Artificial is something which is not natural.

QoVE2erFaa	I'm assuming you want the area enclosed by the curves.    It's best to sketch the graph to see the situation. Both curves start at the point (0, 2). Then 4-2cos(x) goes up to a max at (pi, 6) while 2cos(x) goes down to a min at (pi, -2).   After pi, 4-2cos(x) then goes down while 2cos(x) goes up and they meet at (2pi, 2). Thus, 4-2cos(x) is always above 2cos(x).    If f is always >= g, then the area between them is the integral of  ( f(x) - g(x) ) dx. So we get :  integral from 0 to 2pi of  [ (4-2cos(x) ) - (2cos(x)) ]. I get 8pi.
26ece5583b9e251b1412b7ebc4bacd00aa	poly is a prefix which stands for more than one.    Degree of a polynomial is expressed as a sum or difference of terms (e.g., in standard or canonical form), the exponent of the term with the highest exponent is the degree of the polynomial. The degree of a term is the sum of the powers of each variable in the term. The words degree and order are used interchangeably.    For example, the polynomial 7x2y3 + 4x ? 9 has three terms. (Notice, this polynomial can also be expressed as 7x2y3 + 4x1y0 ? 9x0y0.) The first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of 2 and 3), the second term has a degree of 1, and the last term has a degree of 0. Therefore, the polynomial has a degree of 5 which is the highest degree of any term.    To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form, for example (y ? 3)(2y + 6)( ? 4y ? 21), first express the polynomial as a sum or difference of terms by multiplying each of its factors, combine any like terms, then determine its degree. Since, (y ? 3)(2y + 6)( ? 4y ? 21) = ? 8y3 ? 42y2 + 72y + 378, the degree of the polynomial is 3.    So the degree of your term of three variables is 15.|`|Ww9pdiGnaa	monomial= 1 term  polynomial=many    also to get the degree you just add all the exponents together|`|1GdrrDvwaa	Actually, you're right.  13 is a monomial since it only has one term.  The way to find the degree of a polynomial is to find the largest exponent of a single term and since there are 3 separate terms in this case, 8 is the degree of the polynomial.|`|6qxWQDBdaa	poly-is more than 1  mono-means 1  so 13 is not a polynomial  when looking for the degree, you add the exponents-5+2+8=15

yrEuZXSOaa	The hydrogen atom/ion is used for the electron transport chain to generate a electrochemical gradient. The electron flows from carrier protein to carrier protein releasing energy that is used to drive the hydrogen ion across the membrane to create this gradient. When the hydrogen atom/ion travels back across the membrane, down the gradient, the energy it releases is used to make the ATP.

GgX1iEJDaa	I'm going to assume you mean that as...  (x2)/(62) + (y2)/(52) = 5(36)/3 - x2    Hm, how is it possible.. well... There are lots of values where it is true. Consider that y could be zero, and then x would just have some values to make both sides equal. Then consider x as zero and y would have some values to make them equal. There are others between them.    Try solving it for y:    x2/62 + y2/52 = 5(36)/3 - x2  y2/(52) = 5(36)/3 - x2 - x2/62  y2 = 53(36)/3 - 52x2 - 52x2/62  y2 = 53(36)/3 - 52x2(1 - 1/62)    y = [ 53(36)/3 - 52x2(1 - 1/62) ]      Graph the following at the given site:  xmin -20, xmax 20, ymin -20, ymax 20    Function f(x) -- copy and paste the below in  sqrt(5^3*sqrt(36)/3-5^2*x^2(1-1/6^2))  ;-sqrt(5^3*sqrt(36)/3-5^2*x^2(1-1/6^2)...    You'll get a tall ellipse. Any point on that ellipse is a solution to the equation. If you put in any x-value between the max and min values (where the part under the square root above is zero, which is where the ellipse ends on the graph), you will get a pair of points for the curve (one for the top part and one for the bottom part).    There are an infinite number of such solutions.|`|WNfAMR7Eaa	ahh you made my head hurt.  first combine the like terms then get each variable to one side then do the exponents and perform it like a 2 step equation.  i think.

D4Ko5ll2aa	We have a vector pointing at 90 degrees true (the wind, going east, which we will call w) with a magnitude of 65. We also have another vector point at 315 degrees true (the ring wraith, called r) with unknown magnitude (called m).    We can find the projection of r onto w. The angle between r and the extended line represented by w will be 45 degrees. Since, in a 45 degree right angled triangle, the hypotenuse length is sqrt(2) times the other side lengths, the projection of r onto w will be a vector pointing the other direction with a magnitude of m / sqrt(2).    We want this orthogonal projection to cancel with the wind, so we want:    m / sqrt(2) = 65  m = 65sqrt(2)    This is also be the magnitude of the resultant vector, representing the Ring Wraith's flight. Remember, 45 degree right angle triangle? The sides are of equal length.

AA11693856	Arthur clarke 2010 thought it would form a small solar system, but that was by intelligent design.  Actually when the planet 'lit up' in would blast Jovian moons to rubble and the rubble would fall into the new star.  Earth would be practically unaffected.  Mars would lose it's atmosphere a bit quicker.  The asteroid belt would probably disintigrate as they are blasted into comets, and the unstable orbits throw stuff all over the place.  Duck!   Same with the Jovian 'trojan' asteroids.  Rest  of solar system practically uneffected except maybe less Zodiac light and one month every year there would be a twilight instead of night.    As a red giant, the inner planets would fall into either star, Saturn would quickly get thrown out of system, rest might survive a few million years but they too would get thrown out.|`|jcGeCJnOaa	For Jupiter to be a red giant;    1) It would have to be at least 1000 times more massive than it is.    2) It would have to be about 5 billion years older than the solar system.

AA11523701	You want a description of what they are and what they look like?      Angel's Window is a large arch eroded into the side of a rock ridge extending from the rim of the canyon.  Seen from a distance, the opening of the arch forms a 'window' through which you can see the canyon in the background.     Cape Royal is a popular and scenic overlook at the North Rim (near Angel's Window).  It is on a ridge of lands that extends far out into the canyon so that you have pretty impressive views in all directions.  From the overlook area, a narrow blade of stone extends out to a large mesa called Wotan's Throne - this is a very popular shot for both photographers and painters.    Both Cape Royal and Angel's Window are located about a 30 mile drive from the North Rim Lodge.  The whole area around the North Rim of the park is covered with pine forests and open meadows - it is not uncommon to see elk, deer and wild turkeys.    Unlike the high developed South Rim, there is only lodge at the North Rim, but it is a pretty cool historic stone building sitting right on the edge with a big patio area to take in the view.  Rooms are either histric cabins or a block of newer hotel-like rooms.  There is also only the one main dininghall at the lodge and a small snackbar.  Because it has fewer facilities and is further away from a major city, the North Rim sees only a fraction of the visitors as the South Rim and thus remains relatively quiet and peaceful even during the peak summer tourist season.  It is also a bit cooler.    Note that the North Rim facilities (lodge, store, ranger station) are only open from mid-May to mid-October and closed the rest of the year.  Because of the limited season and limited rooms, it is best to book reservations well in advance.      The nearest town is Fredonia and Kanab on the Arizona-Utah border (about an hour and a half drive north of the canyon).  Both are fairly small towns at that.  It takes about 5 hours to drive from the South Rim around to the North Rim (via way of Lees Ferry on the east).|`|NQLfzZ1eaa	Have you tried Google Earth?

This is a job that has a lot of competition (as do a lot of animal related careers) so do everything you can to give yourself the edge. You can get experience by helping train dogs as an assistants or taking a dog training class, volunteering at a zoo, etc. Training dogs can help you help you understand how dogs learn and some training techniques. Volunteering at a zoo, you may gain experience with exotic animals as a jr. zookeeper or improve your public speaking skills as a guide or camp counselor.    You can also read books and start learning what you can about animal training, animal behavior, psychology, and other subjects that may relate to being an animal trainer.  http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info...  http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Shoot-Dog-Tea...  http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Behavior-...  http://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Organisms...      http://www.sandiegozoo.org/jobs/keeper_f...

If you do, you are going to have a rational function where the horizontal asymptote is 1, vertical asymptote is -2, x-int is 0 and y-int is zero.    thus the limit as x approaches -2 from the left is that it goes up to positive infinity.  the limit as x approaches -2 from the right is that it goes down to negative infinity.  the limit as x approaches negative infinity is that y approaches 1 from above  the limit as x approaches positive infinity is that y approaches 1 from below|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	The algebra is messy, especially with the limitations of a computer keyboard, but here goes:    f(x+h) = (x+h)/(x+h+2)  Therefore  f(x+h) - f(x) = [(x+h)/(x+h+2)] - [x/(x+2)]  To simplify that, we need to get a common denominator.  We do that by multiplying the top and bottom of the first fraction by (x+2), and the top and bottom of the second fraction by (x+h+2).  So here goes:    [(x+h)/(x+h+2)] - [x/(x+2)]  =  { [ (x + h) (x + 2) / (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ] } - { [ x (x + h + 2)] / (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ] }  =  { [ (x^2 + 2x + hx + 2h) ] / [ (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ] } - { [ (x^2 + hx + 2x) ] / [ (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ] }  =  [ (x^2 + 2x + hx + 2h) - (x^2 + hx + 2x) ] / [ (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ]  =  (2h) / [ (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ]    Then, if you put that expression over h and reduce, you get  2 / [ (x + h + 2) (x + 2) ]    Finally, the limit of that as h approaches 0 is    2 / [(x + 2)^2]    And that's the answer.

(the difference between a comet and an asteroid is that a comet is made of ice)    A comet is easier to see than an asteroid (for same size, at the same distance).      An asteroid must be bigger than about 100 metres across (300 feet) to cause any serious damage (like a whole village).    To cause the same kind of damage, a comet must be bigger (because they are loose assemblage of ice, rocks and dust, they tend to break up very quickly when they hit the atmosphere.    We can spot a 100 m asteroid at least 5 years before it passes close.  Therefore, we should be able to spot an equivalent comet even longer before.    I don't know of any large-enough comet, coming close to us for the next 10 years at least.    ---    Apophis is NOT a comet.  It is an asteroid.  It has been downgraded to 0 on the Torino scale. (It is the only asteroid that made it up to 4 on that scale, that goes up to 10 -- the Torino scale combines the probability of impact with the possible damage).    I'm am happy (?  no, not really) that someone is already playing up the 2020 end-of-the-world hoax.  Mind you, I find it a bit early, as we have to get by the 2012 hoax first.    I think that the 2020 hoax will be my favorite one (really?  no, I don't like hoaxes) because it is based on a calendar (like the ends-of-the-world of 2012 and 2000) that could much more easily be linked with the usual fake prophesies.    ---    http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/a99942.html    As of May 2008, the 2029 pass of Apophis is not even listed any more on the NASA site.

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	For $50 it's probably a good deal. The optics on these scopes are generally OK. The mount will be a bit shaky, but there are ways to stabilize it. It will show you plenty of detail on the Moon, Jupiter's major belts and four Moons, Saturn's rings and several moons. Mars will be very tiny, but that's true with most scopes. You'll be able to see at least half the deep sky objects in Messier's catalog, and many pretty double stars. My first telescope was a 4.25" reflector, so I have a soft spot for this size of scope!    You should probably get yourself a couple more eyepieces to expand the range of the scope. This is easy if it has a 1.25" focuser: get a 32mm and a 6mm.

This is not a very good telescope, but for $50 you aren't losing much.

Better to wait and save your money for something better.|`|AA10543440	This is a small reflecting telescope (4.5 inch mirror) and should give you nice views of the moon and small views of planets.  You'll be able to see the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, as well as the phases of Venus.      You'll have to learn how to find and track the things you are watching because the moon, planets and stars move across your field of view.  You'll find it fun, I expect.  I assume the telescope comes with its Meade tripod mount and stuff.  Meade is reputable and you may be able to find online copies of the Meade documentation at their web site, or by searching with your favorite search engines.      Don't expect "Hubble like" views, but you'll love the views of the moon and bigger planets.    You may want to get another eyepiece someday -- this one will give you about 80 power, and you could use more power after you become familiar with the scope.  Perhaps a 6 or 8 mm eyepiece, giving you 120 or 150 power, would be nice.      Find a dark sky place (not Times Square unless the power is out), and you'll enjoy it a lot.  Probably give you the itch for something bigger someday.|`|LfhPBHROaa	That is a good little scope.  You should be able to see the moon very clearly along with the major planets.

So for large n we have    n(  (1+ 1/n)   -1)  = n( 1 + (1/2) (1/n) -1 )  = n/(2 n) = 1/2    Therefore     Lim (n2 +n) - n = 1/2
4BqjVDxaaa	The common answer would be because of Bernoulli's Principle, and how the air on the top wing needs to flow faster and thus exerts less pressure than the air on the bottom of the wing.    However, here's an alternative explanation that I found to be quite interesting: http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...|`|qaMPEdL2aa	The engines push the plane through the air.  The top of the wing is curved so the center is higher than the edges and the bottom is flat.  The path of air over the top of the wing is longer than the path under the wing, so the air on top must move faster over the wing than the air on the bottom.  By Bernoulli's principle the faster moving air has lower pressure, so the pressure difference between the bottom and the top provides a force that lifts the wing.|`|rDpk6Bkfaa	Airplane wings are airfoils!    The air above the wing travels faster and farther than the air below, creating lower pressure above the wing. Higher pressure below the wing pushes the wing and the plane upwards.
1a2059f07e86d2a29a32435b775c7d01aa	Professor of Physics at the University of Amsterdam.  Noted publisher of Physics and Nobel Prize winner.  The Nobel Prize in Physics 1910.    In 1864 he was appointed teacher at a secondary school at Deventer; in 1866 he moved to The Hague, first as teacher and later as Director of one of the secondary schools in that town.    In 1873 he obtained his doctor's degree for a thesis entitled Over de Continu?teit van den Gas - en Vloeistoftoestand (On the continuity of the gas and liquid state), which put him at once in the foremost rank of physicists.    "Equation of State" embracing both the gaseous and the liquid state; he could demonstrate that these two states of aggregation not only merge into each other in a continuous manner, but that they are in fact of the same nature.     Subsequently, numerous papers on this and related subjects were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and in the Archives Nerlandaises, and they were also translated into other languages.    1876, the new Law on Higher Education was established.  Van der Waals was appointed the first Professor of Physics.    1890, the first treatise on the "Theory of Binary Solutions" appeared in the Archives Nerlandaises - another great achievement of Van der Waals.    Van der Waals' thermodynamic theory of capillarity, which in its basic form first appeared in 1893.      Van der Waals was the recipient of numerous honours and distinctions, of which the following should be particularly mentioned. He received an honorary doctorate of the University of Cambridge; was made honorary member of the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow, the Royal Irish Academy and the American Philosophical Society; corresponding member of the Institut de France and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin; associate member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium; and foreign member of the Chemical Society of London, the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A., and of the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome.

cJPOs7Tsaa	Real, real far. Beyond the reaches of our solar system. Exactly how far depends on the constellation. The nearest stars are light years away, and therefore there would be no noticeable difference in the constellations if you were observing them on Neptune, for instance. It's comparable to observing 2 cruise ships on the horizon, and then moving 50 feet over and observing them again. They'll appear to be the same.|`|f1beDbKIaa	Depends on how good your vision is.  We can detect "movement" with parallax with the Earth's movement around the Sun out to 1000 light years.    Some stars would appear to move even if you only go part of a light year.  Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is only about 8 light years away.  The eye can detect changes of about 3 arc minutes, which isn't much.    Kepler had a copy of the Almagest. It has the positions of many stars.  But Kepler had a crude device with which you can measure the angles between stars with your eye. He used it by pointing it out his bedroom window. And, he found that they were in gross error.  So in only 1400 years, things had moved enough to be noted easily.|`|jSPj3S6faa	You wouldn't have to move at all.

ndjVs0ELaa	Gold is found in nature in quartz veins and secondary alluvial deposits as a free metal or in a combined state. It is widely distributed although it is rare, being 75th in order of abundance of the elements in Earths crust. It is almost always associated with varying amounts of silver; the naturally occurring gold-silver alloy is called electrum. Gold occurs, in chemical combination with tellurium, in the minerals calaverite and sylvanite along with silver, and in the mineral nagyagite along with lead, antimony, and sulfur. It occurs with mercury as gold amalgam. It is generally present to a small extent in iron pyrites; galena, the lead sulfide ore that usually contains silver, sometimes also contains appreciable amounts of gold. Gold also occurs in seawater to the extent of 5 to 250 parts by weight to 100 million parts of water. Although the quantity of gold present in seawater is more than 9 billion metric tons, the cost of recovering the gold would be far greater than the value of the gold that could thus be recovered.|`|EJSdI25Naa	a. is your only answer.

The jet stream shifted, bringing frigid weather to the east, but kept the west relatively warm. It is also possible that the scientist predicting the weather are buying into the theory of global warming, which has thus far failed to accurately predict future weather patterns. So for your question, unless the jet stream changes its latitude position again, february will be just as cold.

IjcmAmGbaa	Don't know what a swing does mean in English (I am French) but I presume this problem has been submitted to make understand the principle of the conservation of motion of a material system.    As motion is defined by m (mass) x v (velocity) and remains constant, and  considering that the system is composed of "the bird + the swing", the equation establishing the conservation of motion of this systeme is:    mb0 x vb0 + ms0 x vs0 (motion before bird takes off) = mb1 x vb1 + ms1 x vs1 (motion after bird take off)    so as vb0 = vs0 = 0 because the system is at rest, we get :     0 = 52 x 2 + 153 x vs1, so vs1, which is obviously negative as the swing is going towards the opposite direction than the bird.|`|TsjJscmzaa	1.47m/s - I think. Weight of bird * speed = 52 * 2 = 104. Mass of swing = 153, therefore, force pushing back on swing = 153/104 = 1.47.

A lot of this has to do with the fact that almost all the genes on the X chromosome have no counterpart on the Y (it's kind of like the Y is missing a branch).

TINOKubBaa	SOCA> Don't feel like this is "dumb". Your (asking the question) shows effort in wanting to learn the math. It seems evident that you are not merely looking for quick answers.    Math can "get away" on us pretty quickly! Miss one day or even ten minutes of a class and you could get lost for the rest of the course. One thing is built on the thing before it .... and so you should clear up any big confusion as you go along.     PLEASE ask any question -- anytime. We appreciate your presence here, and it is good practise for us. Thanks and excuse my grammar and spelling.    It would work if the perimeter  were presented:    (x-8) + (x) + (20) =70    2x +12 = 70  2x =  58    x = 29    Now if you were given some other value of the triangle such as the area, and (or)  the type (i.e. right ...) then an alternate method of cracking this could be executed.    WELL I WENT AND WORKED OUT THE COSINE LAW WITH YOUR TRIANGLE AND IT IS INDEED A "RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLE" ... So you were likely told it was a right angle triangle in the problem...    THE 29 UNIT LEG IS THE "HYPOTENUSE".    BACK ENGINEERING YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE DEEPER I CAME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING MANNER OF "ASKING" THE QUESTION. THIS IS MOST INTERESTING -- you score a star.    Given a triangle with leg lengths of: 20 units, (x) units and (x-8) units --- where "x" is the hypotenuse --- determine the perimeter of the  triangle.    >of course there could be a dozen variations of this question ... Thanks for the cool question.  Here is the math answer to the re-posed question:    Using the pythagorean theorem :  (x-8)2 + (20)2 = x2  (x-8)2 + 400 = x2 now FOIL the first term:  (x2 -16x +64) + 400 =x2 manipulate equation:  -16x +64 = 0  notice the x2 "cancel off"?  16x = 464  dividing both sides by 16    x = 29   The hypotenuse is 29 inits long and after working out the simple algebra* the perimeter is found to be 70 units.    * From the original equation sub in ( the now known ) value for "x" in the following:    (x-8) + x + 20 = perimeter  let's let P represent the perimeter:  Substituting ...    P=(29 -8) +29 +20  P =21 + 29 + 20  P= 70    The perimeter of the triangle is 70 units.|`|iIjsFLtjaa	Side C:  x - 8 + 20 + x = 70  2x = 58  x = 29    Side A:  = 29 - 8  = 21    Answer: Sides: A, 29; B, 20; C, 21    Proof (perimeter is 70):  = 29 + 20 + 21  = 70|`|AA11347901	ok first you add them all together   you get x-8+20+x=70  then combine like terms. you get 2x+12=70  subtract 12 from both sides   then you get 2x=58  58 divided by 2 =29  then plug in 29 to both x's  you get (29)-8 +20 +29  that equals 21+20+29 which equals 70    i hope you understood that.
6Trgwz1yaa	Ok, one of your answers is correct!  It would make no difference.  so it is b. no different.    Gravity depends on 2 things  (1) the mass of the two objects (the star and the earth)  (2) the distance between them.    In this case the mass of the 2 objects has not changed, nor has the distance between them.    So the gravitational force between the 2 objects is not changed.|`|AA10222010	If our own sun somehow became a black hole Earth's orbit around it wouldn't change at all.

HgXVOP8jaa	I think I misinterpreted your original question (see orig. response below).  I guess you are just asking why it takes longer for the muscle to stop applying force when the tetany is removed.  This is likely to do with the fact that actin/myosin bridges have maximally shortened the muscle fiber and therefore take longer to "unfurl" than the partial shortening seen with a signal shock.      If you are asking about neuromuscular blockade or NMJ dysfunction assessment:  Wow...this is really a very specific question and its worded a bit funny but I believe you are referring to assessing the degree of blockade at the neuromuscular junction?    If you give a tetanic train of stimuli and then follow up a few seconds later with assessment you get a larger response (post-tetanic augmentation) than the single twitch and then in the following 5+ minutes it will be depressed relative to the single twitch (post-tetanic depression).      This occurs because the tetanic pre-stimulus mobilizes acetylcholine vesicles for release for the augmentation phase.  This also reduces the available readily mobilized vesicles and thus you get the depression phase.    Of course all of this depends on having a nondepolarizing defect of neuromuscular junction function to start with such as a curare-like agent, myasthenis, or Lambert Eaton syndrome.  The effect is particularly strong in LEMS.

SvmZlLdaaa	A gorilla doesn't stand a chance against a lion. Generally, the maximum weight of a gorilla is about 460lb, compared to 550lb for a lion. Lions are also swifter and have quicker reflexes, much larger canine teeth, eighteen razor-sharp claws and natural predatory instincts. They are immensely strong animals that have evolved to prey on animals considerably larger than themselves, such as buffalo, zebra and wildebeest. A gorilla is a piece of cake by comparison. Gorillas are certainly strong, but they're completely outclassed by lions.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	lion|`|RzSrsttkaa	Gorilla super strong|`|M1D4iAuWaa	Thanks for your question. This is an impossible question to answer as it assumes that both a gorilla and a lion would react instinctively and in the same way if they met. It assumes no individuality nor intelligent behaviour on the part of either animal. You are also assuming that a gorilla and lion would automatically fight if they saw one another. This assumes that a gorilla is incapable of reasoning and is inferior to a human. Do you fight with every person, or other animal you meet? Why should a gorilla? Or a lion for that matter?     You should note that the gorilla is one of the most intelligent animals on the planet and has recently been found to use tools. Each gorilla would probably react differently on seeing a lion.    It is unlikely that a gorilla would encounter a lion in the wild, as lions live in more open habitats than do gorillas. I can only guess what the most likely scenario would be, as there are a lot of 'ifs' in this scenario. I would guess that if a gorilla felt threatened by a lion, it would go through its threat routine, such as beating its chest and calling loudly, to intimidate the lion. If the lion ran away, the gorilla would probably chase it. I think that the lion would stay where it was and that the gorilla would run away into the rain forest. If the lion ran after the gorilla, I think the lion would be more likely to win any battle that ensued. I don't think that the lion would enter thick rain forest, though, so the gorilla would probably escape.|`|e18d072e364cde72f131e9f26a7a62b0aa	the gorilla would win because the lion is depending on being able to suffocate the gorilla by a bite to the throat or muzzle but the gorilla's skin is thicker than say a deer or antelope (lions usual prey)   the gorilla could simply break its back with one swipe of his massive arm|`|YHmr7nvsaa	A gorilla has no chance against a lion.

hiGAR1Kmaa	Latent heat-    When any material is heated to the temperature where it changes state, the temperature will remain the same until all the material changes state. That means ice water will remain at 0oC (32oF) until all the ice is melted. The same thing applies when cooling the materials.    The reason is that energy must be expended to change the state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. Likewise, energy must be withdrawn to change the state when cooling the material. The amount of energy required is call the latent heat of freezing or boiling.      Melting / Freezing-  80cal/g    Boiling / Condensation  540cal/g
GF1NPlBSaa	I'm a Clemson grad (not an engineering alum, but almost every roommate I ever had was an engineer of some sort) but have many friends from NC State and spent considerable (leisure) time there.  Honestly, it's kind of a toss-up.  Both schools have outstanding engineering schools and both are highly ranked by US News & World Report rankings (Clemson is 61 overall, 22nd best public school; NC State is 82 overall, 37th public).  I know at NC State it seems to be easier, and more trendy, for students to double-major--I'm not sure why.  Clemson engineering students have to be exceedingly talented to double-major because the curriculum is so rigorous.    What other kinds of factors are you looking for?  Clemson is smaller and has more of a "family" feel to its campus.  (NC State is enormous both in area and population, and I've also found its campus tends to feel like it has "enclaves" versus being one all-encompassing campus.)  Clemson has an arguably better football program and a comparable basketball program (though inferior basketball tradition).  Clemson is small-town, with the nearest sizeable city (Greenville) about a 40-minute drive and the nearest city with "creature comforts" (Anderson) about 20 minutes.  NC State is smack-dab in the middle of Raleigh, of course, and has Durham and Chapel Hill close by.  Clemson's location leads to a reputation of having nothing to do on the weekends, and sometimes that can be true; but you can always find something to do if you're creative.    Speaking from my years in the professional world, I can tell you that Clemson's engineering degree is probably more well-known in NC than NC State's is in SC, if that makes sense.  There is not a large influx of NC State engineers coming to this state, in other words, while there are significant pockets of Clemson engineers in NC (and GA too).  I don't know if that would influence you or not.      Oh, I just thought of something unique to Clemson that may help your decision: There is a program called, I think, "Communication Across the Curriculum" (CAC) which stresses the importance of professional communications skills (writing, speaking, etc) no matter what your major is.  That program began at Clemson and has been the inspiration for similar programs at other schools, and it's the major reason Clemson won Time Magazine's 2000 Public College Of The Year award.  I've provided a link to the CAC program.    I'd be happy to expound more if you have any specific questions or factors you'd like information about.|`|NsmrIxotaa	I know a guy who's studying biochemical engineering at Clemson, he's in graduate school there now.

TMB4d3FAaa	Plants react to centrifugal force as if it were gravitational pull. If you put a plate of dirt with viable seeds on a phonograph and turn it on so that the table rotates the outward pull will cause the plants to grow as if the outer rim were the center of the earth.  As the plants grow toward the center of the table the centrifugal force decreases and the plants grow more erect. As the plants reach the outer edges of the plate the centrifugal force is greater and the plants lean in towards the center. You get all the outer outer plants leaning toward the center. The very central ones would be erect.  The roots would grow outward in increasing order in response to the centrifugal (fake gravity) force.|`|AA11148143	Plants cannot differentiate between gravity and centrifugal force any better than we can, so they grow crooked.
