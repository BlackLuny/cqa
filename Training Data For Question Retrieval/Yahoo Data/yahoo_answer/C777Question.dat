I know you do not have to take classes to work most places down here, but I'd prefer to because I do not know my drinks too well and think it would help me out - I figure they will help me find a job after too. Anybody out here know of any good ones in the area? Most of the feedback that I get is that they all suck down here. Thanks if you can help any!!!

20090203150723AAV8o4l	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What is the best carrot cake mix?	My best friend's birthday is coming up and I think her favorite type of cake is carrot cake (it's odd too because even though she's not a fan of cream cheese frosting, she likes it with carrot cake).       I am planning on baking a cake using a mix from a grocery store but was wondering which one was the best? I bought the Duncan Hines Decadent Carrot Cake because I thought it would be the moistest and most "home-made" tasting one, but I've heard a few poor reviews.       Some of the reviews mentioned the odd smell of the carrots or the fact that the raisens since to the bottom.       Question #1: Is there a better mix out there?      Question #2: Will this one turn out fine if I just don't add the carrots/raisens (is the cake itself good?)      Question #3: More generally, if a cake recipe asks for vegetable oil, can one use olive oil?

Story behind this question-   Okay so in my grade there are these "cupids" that go around delivering plastic roses that the students had sent to eachother in advance, on Valentines Day. I signed up for this in OCTOBER! I was literally the second person im my entire grade (of about 150 kids)!! But then the teacher in charge decided to have people sign up AGAIN, and then to randomly select the names, instead of picking the first 25 names. I considered putting my name in twice, but I was worried about getting caught. I didn't get picked :( I've wanted to be a cupid since 6th grade!!! (two years ago) but now, since I can't be one (I even begged) I decided that I have to out-do the stupid cupids by making WONDERFUL cupcakes for EACH OF MY CLASSES! Woo! So, please, help! Any other tips for my situation would be great!
20090203151221AA9J3UR	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How to make a mail-able hang-over kit?	My brother is turning 21 and I want to make him a hang-over kit. He lives a few states over from me, so I need something that's easily send-able (like I looked up hangover kits but people were saying tomato juice and stuff that i don't want to send).     I don't drink so I have no idea what to give him - I'd rather he didn't drink, but I might as well help him with the effects.    He's a starving musician, so any little cheap things will work as I'm sure he won't actually go out and buy himself any hang-over help.    And any advice (like I read somewhere to not take tylenol because mixed with alcohol it's bad or something). It's not like he hasn't drank before, but just stuff to make it cute :-P    Thanks!

20090203155202AAz0dMn	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegetarians: Are you against hunting?	I have been vegetarian since I was 10 and would never in a million years hunt myself.  But I actually don't want hunting to be banned because I think its preferable to farming.  Obviously I would rather both hunting and farming were illegal.  But as there are farms, I don't want hunting to be made illegal.  If somebody is going to eat meat I'd rather they go out and shoot a wild animal whose lived a free life than buy meat from a farm where the animal has had a terrible life, and then been killed in a slaughter house.  Hunting involves a lot of suffering, there's the fear of the chase, and then the pain of the bullet wounds which often don't kill straight away.  But I do think slaughter houses are worse...what do you think?  I think we're heading in the wrong direction...hunting is being banned before farming is.  It should be the other way around.

Let me give you some hints or clues.  The word "mock" in this case, means to imitate.  Therefore, the oyster is not at all an ingredient in the recipe.  There is an ingredient however, that "by taste" imitates the taste of the oyster when combined with all the other ingredients.  So, there you go...no more hints.  I am looking to find the very best recipe for this.  Okay, I can give one more hint, the "mock" oyster dip is served hot.  That's it for now, that really was your last hint.

20090304202944AAAfykO	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	QUICK! I need help with fondant on this cake...?	I'm baking a cake for my sister's 18th birthday which is on Friday. I already baked the cake and it is completely cool right now. I am going to use fondant over the whole cake instead of frosting it (too much of a hassle). So do I put a layer of frosting on the cake and then put the rolled out fondant on it? Or do I put the fondant directly on the cake? Will the moisture in the frosting make the fondant sticky?       OH and how do I store the cake so the fondant doesn't get sticky? I put a regular cover over it last time but the fondant bow I put on it "deflated" because of the moist air trapped under the cover. Can I just leave the cake out until Friday, with maybe a net cover over it so bugs don't get to it? Will they cake dry out?
