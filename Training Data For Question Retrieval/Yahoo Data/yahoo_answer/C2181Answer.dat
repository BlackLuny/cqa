EXpNpZ6oaa	Yep, I've heard of them. In fact, I've used them and been on their books for about 7 months. Must admit that initially, I was a bit wary (quite a few scam agencies out there) after reading some negative things about Dynamic Models and model goals (who they use to vett all new models they're interested in). However, since being on their books and using an approved studio, I've done quite well out of it (about 3000 but don't tell the taxman though. lol).       I must also admit that there was a slight delay with getting my images after going to Skylite studios but after that, the wait was well worth it and they did not charge me a penny to join.     So if you're thinking of doing modelling, give them a try but never use an agency that charges a start up fee of any kind. Bad move!!!|`|u3L3L1xRaa	hi yes they can be trusted    I went through Model goals to get my porfolio as i dident have one , the studio they sent me to was great and i got some realy nice pictures , i did spend abit of money which i wasent sure about first of all but def worth it as i have had a possitive response from dynamic models and i am now on there books .    iv done one fassion show for them which paid well and i have a casting next week which im realy looking forward to , also they organised a test shoot for a photograper for me, i dident get paid for but got some great exsperience and amaizing new pictures to add to my portfolio, so just a suggestion guys dont turn down work just cause its unpaid its great exsperience, so im realy happy with dynamic and model goals .
RLHy0fW9aa	Hi I had the same problem as you. It turned out that something in my Xbox was broken, it was nothing to do with my connection. Now i have to send my Xbox to microsoft to get it fixed. So you could ask Microsoft to look at it. Sorry if this isn't it but it does sound the same thing as mine.|`|fEeEP7vYaa	Its has to be your connection to the host if thats not it  then something or someone is taking your internet if its not block.  if thats the case put a security on your router.  someone is probably taking your internet and making you extremly laggy.  This happened to me.    If thats not it then you will probably have to contact microsoft or sony which ever system you have and send it in.  they will do a diagnostic on it and find out the problem.    hope this helps :)  Good Luck!

MK5Ddtiiaa	Possibly, but I would check their website. It will feature special effects. The ride will have new trains as well and will be hooked up with the latest 21st century technology.     Learn more at http://www.sixflags.com/newEngland/info/...    I would think that they would delay it though because of the upgrades and special events they would be hosting.|`|H2qEN27daa	If they said memorial day then it probably wont be until then, but as the person above wrote, keep checkin the website or call them before you go and see what they say. I cant wait to go on the ride. Superman was amazing before without its 'makeover'  =)
AA11850311	yes, and it is very easy.  Copy this folder on the computer where Sims2 currently is  My Documents / EA Games / Sims2  Put that folder on a DVD or flash drive, or if the 2 computers are networked together, you can copy it over the network too.  Install all the Sims2 and all expansions that were on the laptop onto the new computer.  Now take your folder from your old computer and copy it on top of the folder with the same name   My Documents / EA Games / Sims2    on your new computer.  It will ask you if you really want to over-write some files, click yes or yes to all.  All your sims, houses, etc. will now be on your new computer!    **if you have Vista, instead of "My Documents" it will just be in the "Documents" folder
cTRLvVS1aa	depending on what system you have it for, there are different possibilities:    PS2: You need a small piece that plugs into the console where a controller would go to recieve a signal, should have come in the box.    Xbox 360/PS3/PC: Take your controller back to where you bought it and get a new one|`|O2HJjOZwaa	batteries if that doesnt work take it back
7XGa9zcdaa	It could possibly be that the Blu-ray lens needs to be cleaned or replaced.  I had a similar problem, and in talking with Sony, this may have been the cause.  I would talk to the support line and they can tell you what steps to take to remedy your problem.
Vj5X9TyQaa	If you're running GTA IV on Vista then try running it as Administrator by right clicking the icon and selecting "Run as Administrator." If that doesn't work try deleting any files, mods, trainers that you have added since the installation. If all else fails try to reinstall the game. If you're using steam then your saves should still be there when you reinstall it.    Hope this could help :]|`|7bFjuYvhaa	listen to them they ar1 100% ok|`|P69PWZgeaa	Try Reinstalling the game its not the disk its the computer so just un-instal and put back on
n5iFOEY8aa	The picks are the picks. The winning numbers are radomly generated. So unless your trusting in Karma, one set of numbers is as good as the rest.|`|96zZlJVYaa	I have heard that quick pick have more winning success than you picking your own numbers.|`|4bH6L9JSaa	Huh?|`|GsnrT0tGaa	Oh yes why of course. Me being a past winner of the over one million jackpot i have a few tips. Let's just say if you go to a seven eleven or any store like that, you may ask the man if you can observe the tickets before buying. If yes hold the tickets up to the light and look closely. You can see numbers inside. Now this only works with the cheep scratch off under $100 cards but you can still make some cash.|`|MuRS4lo6aa	yeh i think think i have
YPYzqLNxaa	Well it matters how long you've had the ps2. It might be getting old and the gears might be worn out. Ifn ot then Something ight be jammed or sticky in there. DId you happen to spill anything on it?  You can try to take off the Side or top whatever you want to say and try cleaning it off. Thats all i Have to say. Sorry if this doesn't help.|`|I1J7nNFbaa	I had two PS2s do this to me, and I hated it. I opened the system itself up and attempted to clean it. It did not help. When this happens, there is little you can do. Either the gears are worn, covered in something that is messing up the track or something else. I would reconmend going to Amazon or a place that sells ps2s and buying the updated version that is more slim and has the flip top disc tray. I did that and have had no problems with mine. I have had it since about 2005. You should be able to find one for a reasonable price.    You could check the prices here at Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B...
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	The consoles are identical, except possibly the more expensive ones have a larger HDD.    The cost also includes (usually) a term with a (free) LIVE subscription (gold usually), and extra games, and possibly extra accessories.    Good Luck!    PS: The differences are usually listed right on the box, as they are required by law to list contents, so that you can be sure you're not being cheated.|`|pTVxGebbaa	differnt colour (black) better graphics, extra software|`|RdgSFkBLaa	The amount of memory on the hard drive. Sometimes the game packs and accessories, but number one difference is hard drive space|`|JrKDKkR2aa	The core doesn't come with a hard drive.  The Pro system comes with a 60 GB hard drive and it is around $200.  The elite is black instead of white and comes with a 120 GB hard drive for $300-400.

caOfuKl5aa	http://www.dressupchallenge.com    Not exactly the same as those sites but it is fun.  You can do makeovers and they have theme contests you can enter.

1O6bbqplaa	yeah it's called the you suck cause you play rune scape virus.  ha ha, I kidding.  no real virus that I can think of that comes just from rune scape.  but seriously, that game is lame, sort of!|`|pKlKJR4qaa	No way lol.... Jagex would be sued like billions... lol|`|Yac1XQyMaa	No...|`|CAAcoqtYaa	Nope.|`|7bFjuYvhaa	ive played it for like ver and i dont got a virus|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Sadly, no.|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	No , the game itself is safe. Some of the add ons that people use like bots & such do contain viruses & keyloggers. That's why Jagex says not to use them. Watch out if you have to download something at a fan site. Lots of viruses & keyloggers are hidden there.|`|v8oig8cuaa	No its impposible to get a virus off runescape.|`|YPYzqLNxaa	No...lol. My computer would be way messed up then if it did.whoever said that might have gotten one from a hacker maybe or else the website is good|`|QxC8xRgWaa	No you do not. Don't worry, runescape is a perfectly safe game and is not going to give you a virus!|`|P69PWZgeaa	There is a way to put virus on to items so they flash and carry a key logger just look at trade and it will flash like a light bulb DO NOT TAKE IT|`|WzHEJOtyaa	Yes, it gives you a trojan everytime you play, It will destroy your PC!|`|EMjoB768aa	No u dont. u might have got hacked. if it happens again just try to play a diff game like aqworlds (aq.com) it is a fun game. u should try it|`|yVAzOBARaa	look at this logically. if runescape gave a virus, would more than a million people play it?    what you have probally heard is that the runescape applett which can be downloaded from the site, can trigger a response from some antivirus programs. this is because a program is trying to send data to the internet.jagex recognised this problem and are working wityh antivirus program makers to stop it giving a response.    OR you may have heard that runescape places a file in your computer (im not sure if there are antivirus responses for this, i never got one) this is also true, the game adds a file to your profile on your computer called "jagex_runescape_preferences.dat) this file keeps track of any changes you make to your accounts settings (like the screen brightness and volume of music) and is perfectley safe.    Or, as some of the people who have posted on this question already have ablly proved, some people just hate runescape for some reason and like to bad mouth it, and try to fool people into thibking runescape gives viruses so they wont play it. this is usually because they are      A) noobs who tried to play runescape and failed miserabbly.    B) people who have just heard that runescape is for nerds and sucks and have never actually played it to find out the truth.    or C) play WOW|`|vIXpifRwaa	i tried it and didnt get a virus

NJ25E4AZaa	You really should buy a ps3 regardless of the tv. the console is really awesome and has great games and great online service. But yes, it will hook up. You will need to buy an HDMI cable, though, and those cost around 35 dollars (the cheapest). thats the only problem with the ps3, that it is designed to play on an HD tv, and they dont give you all the supplies you need to play it on one.|`|7bFjuYvhaa	The hd part has nothing to do with a ps3. Just get it its a good console and if your tv is hd than that makes it even better. If i am wrong than you can sell it for more than what u bought it for|`|1RIqd60yaa	Yeah you should!  You cannot play a PS3 without a HDTV and your resolution is brilliant! Also having a PS3 also plays Bluray DVDs so having a PS3 covers a console and a Bluray DVD Player!|`|YPYzqLNxaa	Ya it should...i have a way crappy tv and i still get good graphics..not sure if this is helping any but its a try|`|H8tsynxTaa	u wont get 1080p if that is what u are referring to but u will get maximum from ur tv possible  ps. u dont need hdtv to use ps3 i played them on old tube tvs they work but they are waste of money because u cant see the amazing graphics
v8oig8cuaa	They may have increased projectile damage perk on (you get after 5 kills or soming) and if they had red stars around them they had extra health.  Or u may just have alot of lagg..|`|7bFjuYvhaa	that game is on the top 100 glitchy games. Its just a glitch to make the game harder
AA10411048	Do trivia questions about certain TV shows of the 80's such as:  -Miami Vice  -Night court  -Family Ties  -Cheers  -Cosby Show    Also have Little "Sticky-notes" printed with the names of the more popular characters from these shows, as each person enters they recieve "thier character' for the evening. Stick one of the sticky notes on thier forhead or the middle of thier back. (Somewhere that they cant see it) and all night people come up to each other, giving them hints about who they are, and each person has to guess who they are.     You may want to rent and watch movies such as:   -Breakfast Club  -Back to the Future  -16 Candles

nZhjosjZaa	X-Box live alows you to play online, so you are able to play with other people. Left 4 Dead is an awsome game, I played with my friend on his 360 and it was great. It freaked me out sometimes, keeps you on the edge of your seat. i would agree thats its a little more fun playing with other people, but yeah, you should defenitly get that game.|`|rqHyrpC7aa	yeah left 4 dead is a reallgood game to buy i have it and it is really fun. i recomend using a shotgun for most of the missions that your on and if possible duel weild you pistols.|`|RoMnjrataa	Hey, Xbox Live is the internet service where owners of the Xbox 360 can connect to each other through the internet and play games together. There is a fee to pay for the online service although I'm not entirely sure of what the price is but i think its $50.00 for a year of membership. Left 4 Dead is an outstanding game and I recommend it for your husband. People say that it's better if you have Xbox Live because you can play the game with other people online cooperatively against the Artificial Intelligence (the game). Hope I helped and good luck!|`|PKULDaC7aa	XBox live is the online service for the 360. Left 4 Dead is a great game and is more fun online but is still very enjoyable without it. You can play up to 2 players split screen co-op or against each other.

The entire game revolves around teamwork, so if you're playing single player, you're stuck with AI that really sucks and it gets boring quite fast.    Yes, X-Box Live is the online platform.    L4D is a very good game, but it does get old after a while. However, I heard that there's an update coming out soon that comes with new maps and campaigns, so it might be a worthwhile buy.|`|2Wysnyquaa	left4dead is a great game,better on live though.  buy him a 3 month card

But when I want to relax or just get my mind in a settled state, I light some incense and crack a window to get some fresh air in, have a cup of tea (sounds lame but it really helps!) and usually I get all snugged in blankets and listen to music I like, not blasting, just softly.  seriously sit there and close your eyes and just let your thoughts work. it's amazing. if you just shut all your senses off and just feel your thoughts bouncing around and so much will come to you and you will get so relaxed and just happy.    it may sounds strange, but it always helps me!|`|R9iPmdqXaa	i just stare into space and think|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	I listen to music.

NJ25E4AZaa	XIII will be taking place in a city called Pulse, that is set apart from the rest of the world for some unknown reason. It has something to do with the fabula novalis crystals. Versus is going to be a darker spinoff to XIII, and is supposed to have the most serious and best story of all the final fantasy games. I really dont know much about agito. For a trailer to the main game (just XIII) go to www.square-enix.com they have a new and really cool trailer.
WuhIoS1laa	I'm sorry to say that Fable 2 has had many many bugs, and this is one of them.     If you are sure the disc looks fine, then try installing the game to your 360's hard drive and playing it that way.     This only works of course if you have a hard drive and the NXE dashboard.     If it won't install, consider returning the used copy for a different one.

MLbKvHnIaa	Hi. As per the other answers, the Rubik's 360 has not yet been released. It was announced last week at the International Toy Fair in Nurenberg but wont go on sale until July/Aug 2009.    I spoke with the PR firm managing the launch, and they did not confirm the price, but did confirm a world wide launch at the end of the summer.    No formal price has been announced either, although prices of 15 and $15 have been mentioned online.    I have setup a blog that keeps track of the latest Rubik's 360 news, including list of places where you can pre-order or buy the Rubik 360.

If it passes the test, delete the Battlefield 2 folder in My Documents to reset the game settings.    A ctd after the splash screen usually has to do with resolution, refresh rate or video card drivers,.

PKULDaC7aa	You have to play ranked matches and win more than you lose. They use a fairly simple algorithm to determine how many points you get toward gaining levels. Basically, if you play against better people and do well you will get more points than if you play against worse people and if you lose to worse people you will lose more points than if you lose to higher ranked players.|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	In order to get your skill to go higher, you have to win in every game.

FhHkT0bBaa	I don't really have facts and figures,just personal opinion.Ive always thought even as a kid that caging an animal up for people to stare at was kinda weird,usually they look so sad,but that being said if the environment is appropriate,like in bush gardens in tampa,then I think its a little better,and they do save a lot of animals from extinction,so I guess they do some good,but really,zoos started in europe 100s of years ago as a toy for the wealthy and do they really serve a purpose in this connected world we live in today? but I guess that my final opinion is that no,I dont like zoos,unless they are helping to conserve a species.|`|mzKcl7xLaa	im a huge for,      zoos provide jobs for many people,  it protects species through breeding programs,  it gives visiters entertainment    if we didnt have zoos i think a fair few species would have died out and where would you take the kids on weekend?? theme parks are only good for so long!    also you can tell if animals are not comfortable in its enviroment because they will not have babies, animals wont have babies where they think its unsuitable or unsafe
qItxNgMeaa	Yes, you can, though obviously you need the most recent disc each time to play it.

LItIiiHKaa	You need to push this hand for sure.  You don't want a lot of callers here and if so and you play it out your life will probably depend on getting another 10 which means 7:1 that you'll not get it and be even more short stacked.  You're going to have to pony up soon and you may not get a better chance than this.    With this said players typically push too much where they could probably score more by playing softer, but this is with more dominant hands than this and pocket tens don't do that well against a larger field anyway.    King Cobra Poker  http://kingcobrapoker.com|`|p3rnyBoYaa	How severely short stacked were you? Under 10 big blinds then yes push all in and take the blinds if they let you, otherwise you will probably get a call with two over cards and then its off to the races.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	How "severe" do you mean?    So severe that when you limp in it's obvious that you are going all in?  If so, then you are better off pushing first.  No reason to let the blinds limp in one face card then call when they hit.|`|AA11001595	Here's your situation.    If you limp in as you say, you have the following:  A 0% chance of winning the pot before the flop.  A high chance of playing the pot against multiple hands.  A very small chance of playing the pot heads up - you would need someone to raise behind you and then you would be committed to going all in there where they may have otherwise folded to your raise.    In the situation you described, it's all about increasing the chance you either win the pot without any competition or play the hand against as few other hands as possible.    If you go all in, there's a good chance everyone else folds and you win the blinds. There's a good chance you play the pot heads up against a weaker hand. There's a small chance you play the pot more than heads up, and even then, still a good chance you have the best hand.    I'd say all in is the move if you're 10 big blinds or less.|`|tjTbkxkzaa	I'd make a raise of 3-5X big blind.  You don't want someone one with A-x, KJ, QJ to limp in then hit a higher pair and beat you.  You're better off chasing out the riff raff and take a smaller pot than to be greedy and lose a larger pot.  That's how I'd play it the majority of the times.  Tens are easily beat if high overcards come.|`|AA11388450	The next 15 is not that bad, that is some time to fish for something better but with 10s I would say there's no way that you can let that go at up until the river. If you hit trips I would go all in at least within 2 rounds of betting after flopping that.    Otherwise you have to consider the mathematic stats. If you're heads up there's a good chance that you have the best pair but if you're in with 2 others you'd probably have some fair company in terms of hand ranking. But then there are the possibilities of higher cards as well. I would say your best flop without making a real hand would be something like 3-5-9 all offsuit followed by 7-2 on the turn and river respectively. There is a chance that if you went all in after the flop a person with Ace-4 or especially 4-6 would call you and in that case you'd be bust but with the 10s if you have no overcards you'd have to have at least a straight possibilty so that's definitely something to consider. flushes could be meaningless of course but another pocket pair could be looming or even a 2-pair of some of the higher cards within that scenario of a flop.     All said: against your average hand you'd have great chances of winning but depending on the flop you could be in for a very different situation.|`|6Cp41lb6aa	If I'm down to 7 times the big blind or less, then I have only two moves: fold or raise-all-in|`|Ct45CMDgaa	well it all depends what position you are in the tourney but with 10 10 i want to go all in because if you get a big pot the only way you are usually gonna win is if you hit a 10.  But if you get a heads up pot most likely it is a coin flip or better.|`|buUptEcVaa	this sounds like either a house game or casino no limit game....if that's the case then i would have went all in pre flop considering you were short stacked. i would rather win a small pot than a chance of losing to a QK or KJ.|`|Av8aeK2Laa	Standard play is to push if you have less than 10 big blinds in front of you. If you fold out worse hands, that's fine, because then you still pick up the blinds (which is important if you're that shortstacked). If your stack is larger than that, then just make a standard sized raise preflop.|`|VALo05Zdaa	in a tournament, you push all-in cause you need even the small pot if they fold.  at best you want a "coin flip" and get only 1 caller pre-flop.  but really short-stacked will usually get more than 1 caller, so TT's are not that safe of a hand.  you MIGHT see the flop first then push.    in a home game, ill push all-in on the flop if no high cards on the flop.|`|XW7d0sV8aa	depends on how short stacked you are, say blinds are 1,000 and 2,000 and that's all thats in, the average stack is maybe 25,000 and you have 8,000-10,000 then push, if take down right off then you have some to help last blinds till next push hand, if get called you aren't completely hosed, plus stack big enough to keep away those with medium hands just looking to knock you out, if you just limp then fold with king on board you are up against the ropes and will end up all in with a weaker hand eventually, I recommend you look into Dan Harrington's book Harrington on Hold'em volume 2 which talks about playing the M (stack size in comparison to variables) which helps you learn how to play short stack, with it I have been able to go from less than 1/3 the average stack to in the money multiple times
gY84lr2taa	Sims1 and sims2 are different games. They aren't compatible with each other at all.

All participants under the age of 18 years must have a parent or guardian along with them on the tour.     It is important to remember that dolphins are highly intelligent animals and they choose if they wish to participate in the research sessions as well as the interactions with Guests     If you want an opportunity to swim with the 6,000 inhabitants representing over 60 aquatic species inside the 5.7 million gallon saltwater Caribbean Coral Reef aquarium, please consider the Epcot DiveQuest program or the Seas Aqua Tour|`|WUBZrmXzaa	You'll have to bite the bullet - Seaworld is just 6 miles from Disneyworld, and well worth the trip. We recently did the California trip -- having never been to Seaworld before, which is a 1 hour+ drive from Anaheim down to San Diego. We spend 2.5 days at Disneyland and 1 day at Seaworld. Seaworld was much less crowded and their sea mammal shows are just out of this world. Highly recommended, my 9 year old loved it. It doesn't have all the rides Disney does, of course, but the shows are top notch, animals beautiful. Note you can't touch or feed the dolphins at the shows, though they offer some very expensive "interactive programs" where you can help with Beluga whales ($149) or be a trainer for the day ($399).|`|rwXCYxRyaa	Definitely sea world I don't think that you'll find any sea creatures in disney world.

It is a really interactive place for kids. We spent a couple of hours in there. The Living Sea.|`|s4YM3YFIaa	Discovery Cove is expensive but it's worth the cost. You get to swim, feed and touch the dolphins and you can also snorkel with tropical fish and stingrays or if you just want to swim about you can go in the fresh water stream where you can swim about in the shallow area or go explore the stream where it goes, it's actually quite fu you get to sea underwater creatures in windows under the water as you go along. You get a snorkel and goggles the goggles of which you have to return but you can keep the snorkel, and if you go don't take your suncream because they give you this really thick sunblock that will protect you from burning but also protect the animals from the poison in suncream.     Also the food is free all day and you can have what ever you want!    Animal Kingdom is nice to but I don't recall seeing any Dolphins it's mainly african animals and asian animals, they're really quite fascinating. (TIP: if you want to go on the safari it's best to go there as soon as you get in the park because it gets busy and the more animals are usually out at that time plus if you're daughter is young she'll love rafiki's petting zoo, you have to get there by train)  I reccomend the Rapids Ride (I can't remember the name) it's really fun and you don't get wet you get SOAKED!    I really hope you enjoy your time there because it is my favourite holiday destination and I could practically live there with all the amazing stuff they have there!

AA11436801	yes you first have to get the upgrade to be able to build a titan gate, called secret of the titans or something like that...then once you finish that a fairly large circle will appear on the middle of your screen.  Then you just click the circle and then place the titan gate.      Be careful with it, since you can only place it once...now once you get a nice safe spot to put the gate, put about all of your workers, and maybe build some more to work on the titan gate(there will be a percentage to show your progress on it) and once you get to 100% a titan will be released, ready to wreak havok on pretty much everything.  Just like the titan powers(except for the Atlantians) you only have one Titan and one Titan gate...if either are destroyed you loose the Titan and will never be able to build another.(this is also a very good tactic, take out their titan gate before you build your titan, then once they have no chance of getting one you work on getting yours, and once you do they will almost have no way to stop you.)             Building a titan takes a while...probably as much time as building a wonder...and just as many workers, but it is worth the time.|`|AA11502176	After you research the secrets a big round icon appears under your magic boxes. click the icon and then left click to place the gate anywhere that you have LOS. then call a slew of villagers over to dig it up and you're done. The icon might not appear if you use cheats during or right after you research the secrets thing.|`|5cd24b64757b60422674beaef7e91e06aa	When you research the titan a little circle apears below the god powers, click this and place where desired, you then get a heap of vilagers and get them to repiar the titan gate, it might take a while, you can make it faster by using a cheat, you might not want it. Note: Once you click the titan gate circle do not right click because it will cancell it and you won`t be able to get a titan.

But I loved it so!|`|lFC2mqCcaa	Well nothing nintendo becesure nintendo ROCKS (look at name) but I would have to say either the Sega Saturn (because it was stupid and there were no good games for it and now you cant even find the stupid cords for it because i geuss people liked destroying them alot!  LOL...also sega dreamcast was OK/BAD middle of the 2.  I mean crazy taxi is fun for a little...but otherwise stay away from this system.  But a really GOOD console that is not widly known is the Virtual Boy...if anyone say that system sucks, well they just dont know about it.  LOL.  though it wasnt the most succesful system it was still a preety darn good one!|`|2fqXT9W6aa	Phillips CDi. It sucked.|`|heWtmILYaa	Too bad it does not include handhelds because virtual boy would win hands down.  As far as worst console it have to be Sega Saturn.

It was very expensive with no good games to play.|`|L8kPwdA9aa	dreamcast!...ugh it was terrible!!|`|FvEvFIW8aa	virtua boy, simply because every game was all in red|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I'm gonna say the Sega 32X - it was a system that plugged into your Genesis and gave you "32" bit graphics.

Wrbgeeqqaa	My friend has the game. Just like Kingdom Hearts one and Chain of Memorize combined. The graphic is just like KH1, but the story line and the game style is like KH:CoM. I really want it. It would be really fun cause this time you can play as Riku in Riku's story.    Hope this helped!!!!|`|vtJDHJDYaa	No, Chain of Memories is actually the sequel to Kingdom Hearts and prequel to Kingdom Hearts 2. But actually although the storyline is different, you are doing the whole Kingdom Hearts again with same worlds and same bosses. However, you do it using cards.|`|agcwMyNMaa	kingdom hearts re:chain of memories for the ps2 is fun but i played the one for game boy advanced and its not all that fun
d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	The XBOX 360 Arcarde is the exact same system as the others only it does not come with a hard drive. It plays all 360 games (perfectly) and comes with a memory card that allows you to save up to 15 games.      I had my arcarde for over a year and beat a ton of great games on it like Bioshock and Saints Row. The only reason I upgraded to a hard drive is bacause I wanted to play online.      So... if you only want to play games at home- the Arcarde will be just fine.       You're TV will work just fine. The screen will automatically calibrate. Happy Gaming!|`|RPa1LhNqaa	yes just no online for you|`|dnJrOj96aa	get xbox360 elite its way better and bigger memory space

18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	The only computer game with halfway interesting swordfighting in it that I ever saw was Blade of Darkness, and that's an old, old game.  No ships in it either.        Usually it's just punch the fire button to do a basic swing, and that's pretty much what you get.    You should probably just play Oblivion or something.|`|NQMJ6vR2aa	P.T.O., Pacific Theater of Operations. A WWII naval game. Excellent strategy based game. Addictive!
A9TbEueYaa	well their both really good games because of their Graphics|`|RWJfJMz5aa	definately assains creed as they spent so much time making the grafix amamazing. also it is so much fun.|`|BLwtzGWcaa	Assassin's Creed is a great game, lots of things to do, a lot of free roaming ability and a nice fighting system. The views in the game are great too. However, I have always liked the Prince of Persia games and their storyline. I would say their fighting style is more unique and most often more thrilling to watch.     If you aren't so into storyline, and want repetitive quest lines, go with Assassin's Creed.    Prince of Persia would be my choice though. It may not have the free roaming ability, but it makes up for it in storyline and overall badass combat.|`|4oruDhxVaa	i think u should get both i have them both, and assinscreed is only 20 bucks, so yeah just get them both they are both really great gamesbut prince of persia is defently more interesting.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Both are great games though I've only seen Assassin's Creed played, unlike Prince of Persia, which I've been playing myself. I'm the only person I know that has and has started playing the new Prince of Persia and I freakin' love it! It's so much fun to play... fast thinking, quick and exciting moves... I'm only disappointed about the story line (not near as good as the Sand of Time, Warrior Within, and The Two Thrones) and the graphics... which has a drawn-sort-of effect to it, which I obviously believe was done intentionally... for whatever reason. Nonetheless, the game play is awesome - very fun! As for Assassin's Creed, like I said, I haven't played it myself, but just watching it is exciting and I think the story line is far better than the new Prince of Persia. Both are great games, but if you're after a great story line, go for Assassin's Creed, and for game play, I'd recommend Prince of Persia... for now. You really should get both eventually :P|`|RtchVzaCaa	Assassins creed is great you can walk on walks and jump really high and murder people its really fun!|`|mDkUmEUzaa	OMG Assassins Creed - because it is AWESOME.  Graphics are amazing and it is highly addictive.  Its prob cheaper too.  I completed it and sold my copy but had to buy it again after a few months and I have just started it again!
7Ca2ns47aa	I did it... and it was ok I suppose. Just a way to get more weapons and armor and your popularity definitely goes up. If you want to get it, I would suggest getting The Game of the Year Edition, which has both The Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles on it.|`|3LPTLUczaa	It gives you all the download-able content together on 1 disk. It is not worth buying I wouldn't suggest, get the shivering isles instead.    If you do get, don't for the love of god use the Horse Armour on Shadowmere!! It makes Shadowmere dissapear, I stopped playing cause I lost my horse :(.|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	the knights of the nine expansion adds some more quests,weapons and armor and still takes place in cyrodil where you have been exploring already which can help get you to different places quicker.the armor you get along the way levels up with you,so if you get the armor at level 10 it keeps getting better with you.also the shivering isles is a great expansion,sheogorath is a complete nut job and funny as all hell.i think they are both worth getting.hope this helps great game.

92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	It hasn't been announced for another Gears of War 2, but there most likely will be seeing as how they ended the game. I honostly think they'll wait until Microsoft gets as much money they can off of the Halo series, they'll milk it this last time and then start with Gears of War 2. I wouldn't expect it for awhile though. Maybe a year or two next in November. There has been some underground movie been said for Gears, I can't really remember I wasn't exactly interested in it. It sounded like it will be shitty, no budget no good. I love indie films but it sounded like it would be done by a couple of teens with a cam and I don't think Gears should be touched unless there professionals or they have the equipment in my opinion, video games into movies never really work out to good.|`|f0ac23d2b653d9169a5f220e113ae2f3aa	Yes and maybe.

My rating is about 1750 in chess, and yes your IQ is good I don't know mine... That helps, I am smart too, it helps. But I bet you launched yourself to play chess with no basic openings or any basic chess skills. If you want e-mail me I'll give you some quick tips that I assure you will help you in becoming the best at your school.|`|xyPQsMkFaa	you IQ is actually 47...you read it wrong bud|`|tkKJvLPUaa	No, you just may not be good at the game. Chess isnt measured by ones IQ or intelligence, its a game, you may just not be very good at the game, or need to learn from an expert.|`|nmR3gdLUaa	You're out thinking yourself. See how you do on line with other "Novices". if you can beat them, you're just intimidated by the face to face combat.....You're mind can beat them but your personality is holding you back...Have you tried playing a computer? That should tell you something.             I lost all the time when I first started, it made me mad. Guess what? I kept at it and now I can kick most everybody's butt. Giving up is the wimps way out.            Learn your weaknesses, work on correcting them and be patient. Thank the other guy each time he beats you. Plan on kicking his butt in another year.  What else are you going to do, "Give Up"?  What are you, a wimp?..Fight!! Don't give up and don't let losing get in the way of winning....You just need another way to go about it. You lack the "killing" instinct.  Find it!           Every time you lose, you should learn a little more. I'm almost unbeatable to my friends and my IQ is about 125. IQ means nothing if you haven't got the guts........Try it, good luck!|`|c6YtZjFTaa	Chess is about Strategy not IQ buddy. Maybe it just isn't the right game for you.. or maybe you just aren't playing right.|`|xDINUPBuaa	you'll only get better if you concentrate on improving.  the best chess players think 3-6 moves ahead.  If you just play on the fly, you will always lose to someone thinking 1 move ahead.  Not only that, you must think what the other player will do.  So do this.  When you play, think about what the other player will do in response of that move.  If it puts you in a bad position, make a different move.      Other helpful hints:     1.  Control the center of the board with pawns.  2.  if you lose a piece, make sure you take a piece from them.  1 for 1.  3.  don't sacrafice a piece unless it means you win or get a better piece in the process.  pieces are worth queen:10 rook:5 bishop and knight: 3 pawns: 1.  4.  For the first 5-10 moves, always do "textbook" moves.  you'll have to look that up.  5.  Take your time.  Unless in a time limit game.  6.  Try to "castle" whenever you can.  7.  Remember the "en passant" rule.  Look it up if you don't know.

DfPyyDssaa	You should be careful on using cheat codes too frequently until you complete the mission where you save Madd Dogg from jumping off the casino rooftop. The game will prevent you from completing this mission if codes have been used excessively; this number appears to be cheats being used 500 or more times. When this number has been exceeded, Madd Dogg will jump off the roof in a few seconds, making it impossible to save him. Note: If you encounter this problem, enable the "Slow motion" or "Adrenaline effects" codes to get there faster. You still must be quick in order to save Madd Dogg.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	any cheat you use will affect it immediatley. and it will warn you when you try to save that a cheat has been activated and it will affect your completion.|`|3LPTLUczaa	1. If you save after using a cheat it is impossible to get 100% completion.|`|p1M4KAFeaa	900 cheats. If you activate over 900 cheats then mad dog kills himself really quickly in one of the missions|`|tSjql8Tdaa	Cheats stop you getting 100%    It tells you that in the game|`|2g28k1XVaa	The first time I completed it- I had used thousands of cheats before.  (I was on ps2)  It didnt affect my game at all. But it's always different, I guess.|`|rTjVPf5saa	Lol, ive used far over 900 cheats on GTA san andreas and my game still works and saves fine!|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	i have used so many cheats on all the gta games and have never,never had a problem.i have used them on all the different systems and had no problems and yes the little message comes up not to save because cheats have been activated and i ignore it and save anyway.use the cheats and have fun.|`|mOCLDWHjaa	This piece of knowledge has been passed on from many gamers like myself who have also had expierences like yourself maybe... Well all i can say is that DO NOW ENTER the riots cheat until you are out of the Las Venturas area or at least after you have beat the madd dogg mission. The riot will make Madd Dogg jump off of the building before you can save him. If you enter more than 900 cheats you will still be able to complete the game|`|zzFwZZtUaa	Those people about the 100% are right, and about the Mad Dogg mission. what's worse is after the Mad Dogg mission, if the riot cheat is entered your game file will be corrupted, and you will have to start your game over, and possibly reinstall it as well.
j0BejW4Zaa	i have a good idea for u !    the first answer is actual wrong and possible to do    first if u want a big explosion with plasmas or grenades then u want to stop time right?!!  yes    all u have to do is download  devtrainer http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=10...

NHI5TmkCaa	Nintendo DS doesn't have any regional lockout, so yes, you can without any trouble - but it is a good thing you asked, as most consoles (particularly home consoles) do have various forms of regional lockout and require workaround methods to play import games on.    Just make sure they aren't DSi games - the next-gen DS (already out in Japan) does have regional lockout.

u8Km1J3Gaa	Do you have uni?  If you do go to the base neighbourhood and click on the icon to send teens to uni, she should be in that list.  If you have Freetime (i'm sure its that pack) you have the option to get 3 teens/children to grow up with your sim.    Because she is a teen, you won't be able to move her in.   You can use boolprop, there is help using this cheat on www.boolprop.com and www.snootysims.com  But be careful with boolprop, I left it on and corrupted a custom neighbourhood.    There is definitely a solution on the BBS, if you have registered your games then you will be able to post on the forum.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	If you have expansions installed, check the other areas such as Downtown... she might live there.

fBMNjnjLaa	what i would do is play semi-pro until you win over 4-0 in even the big games against top teams. then you add 2 Min's on Professional allowing you more time to score. Or if that dosent work then you should play the average or easy teams on professional and the big teams on semi-pro so it should balance out    hope it helps|`|MuRS4lo6aa	just keep playing the game at the start when your up against the goalie on your own|`|xVMQx7dtaa	Play some friendlies on Legendary and then you should start to find the other difficulty levels easier. Its what i did an know i play on Legenary all the time|`|gzzlVk3caa	play on semi-pro until u start ridiculously winning like by stupid results like 4-0 or more  and when u feel confident enough play on professional but put the time limit up on the game   like play and extra 2 mins  so u have more time to score and then u wont keep drawing|`|fdOsfi9Raa	Play on Pro but play against teams that are in like league two. Then you can progress on to better and harder teams. That's what I did. Look at me I can win 10-0 on Pro. Hope this Helps :)

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Disney has fairly strict guidelines for Adults and Teenagers wearing costumes.  That is they do not allow it.  Disneyland does not allow anyone over 9 to wear a costume except during halloween time when they allow up to 13 year olds.  Adults and older teens can only wear them at special "after hours" events.  As far as I am aware Disney World has the same guidelines.  So if this is true, I am not even sure how you got into the park.    If you had them on and they were visible at the entrance you would have been asked to change or denied entry.  Had you changed into them in the park they have the right to kick you out if you refuse to change out of your costumes.  So them asking you frequently to change and then giving you Disney Clothes on top of that was above and beyond what they needed to do.    They do this for the exact reason you said.  People were confusing you with the "real" Belle and Jasmine.  It can destroy the illusion for the guest and even though your intentions may have been good Disney can't be selective in this.  Because there could be some people who have bad intentions.|`|NLVaUYA1aa	No, they were perfectly right to ask you to change - children will talk to 'characters' very easily - by keeping the personnel only in costumes it was the best policy for the children's safety- any unsavory person (not to imply you and your friend were unsavory at all) could dress in costumes, therefore jeopardizing the safety of the children.|`|s4YM3YFIaa	well i suppose it would be a bit confusing, but i don't think they should make you change its not like the disney theme parks have a rule that you cant wear costumes like disney characters|`|H2qEN27daa	I can see what Disney means, especially with what OC said, but it still does kinda suck, esp. since you worked so hard on your costumes. Post a pic please, i'd love to see them! =D|`|CKpPpK0saa	well, they have people who do this for a living and you going and pretending to be one was pretty bad. i mean if little kids came up to you guys then, yeah they can do that.|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	Disney only allows small children to dress up. because there is no way for people to distinguish you from the "real" Disney Princess.  and they don't know how you will treat other guest. something as simple as turning away a child that wants an autograph or picture could cause a negative impression. and they don't want that. the only time costumes are allowed are for their Halloween events. I know you are disappointed but there is no way for them to know your intentions or how you will treat the guests and they are trying to protect their image.|`|hv1lUDFzaa	hey,you guys should take it as a compliment that your costumes were good! It was wrong of them to ask you guys to change,but you were offered clothes!you shoulda taken them and then kept on your sweeet costumes,maybe lodge a complaint with customer service,nobody would ignore an irritated princess Belle-plus,you guys are 16!you should be able to wear anything(appropriate) you want to disneyland.    just wait till mickey hears about this.|`|0WASp0bHaa	No I don't think it was wrong of them at all. Little kids wouldn't know the difference between a 16 year old dressed as Jasmine from a 23 year old cast member dressed as Jasmine. It would spoil the magic of Disney for the little kids and it would  confuse them that you really aren't the princess of their dreams.

PVMsr2Faaa	Sewing|`|5HGDhEjyaa	How about scrapbooking.      I guarantee you will enjoy this hobby ( I know I do).  You can purchase your supplies at Michael's.  You will need a couple of pictures, a small album ( 8 x 8 ), adhesive, pretty paper and stickers (optional).  Don't forget to journal and say what the picture is about.  As a suggestion, I would go with a small album so that you don't feel overwelmed with a 12 x 12 album.  Once you are completed, you can give your very 1st scrapbooking album as a gift to your family member/friend/boyfriend.     Good luck !|`|gWYArJ0Haa	Get a gym membership, Join a sport or join a league of a sport that you are good at..|`|5YTWIfFdaa	try pottery. its good fun and messy and you get to make pretty things, and if theyr any good then sell them to make some extra money|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	Check out this web site and go to their Trash To Treasure site.

You can learn to cook and bake, you can learn to make jewelery (wires, beads, cords, etc.), you can learn to make things with wood from small carvings to cabinets. You could start writing small stories, or practicing drawing and make small comics and cards for your friends.  You could make scrapbooks with all your memories or learn to sew and make clothes and the like.    Sit down with a notebook and write down all the things you would like to learn to do, don't be afraid to set your limits high!  After that, go to the library or just do a search on your computer to let you know how and where to start on your path to success.    If you have any questions, let me know!

5DK546BUaa	1.) OMG - My mom is 49 and having another child! I would suggest Rose Elaine after my grandmother (her mom - Rosie) and her middle name... I think that she would use it, so Rose Elaine would be my new little sister :)    2.) My love - and so my son would be: Jory Pascal Luxon IV  (back story - Jory's family is primarily Irish and English... however, his great-great-grandmother was French, and her father was Pascal Louis... thus her only son became Jory Pascal and the tradition was born.)    4.) Uproot your family and go to Eastern Europe - What an adventure that would be!    6.) Judita Clover & Ilona Daisy  (First names are after, and variations of, my mother, Judith and his mother, Aileen - Middle names are the opposite grandmother's favorite flowers)    7.) Radovan Patrik Maly - and our family would travel back to America...    8.) My life is perfect - I will not be having any more children, but I most likely will foster many throughout the years, and adopt another at some point in the future...    Suzanna Tiffany & Jory Pascal Luxon III  Jory Pascal Luxon IV  Judita Clover Luxon  Ilona Daisy Luxon  Radovan Patrik Maly Luxon (He keeps his original last name of Maly, but uses it as a middle name until he is of age...)

7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	It depends on what your fighting. The speed & slicing ability of the scimitar is good against robes or light range armor but if they're wearing metal armor your not going to do much. The heavy crush attack of the axe is slower then the scimitar but it hits good through heavy armors.     You need to chose your weapon according to what your fighting.|`|S4Jkk4uTaa	scimmy|`|MNY5gMGBaa	Even though the rune baxe looks good, its not it has rubbish stats.

Ok, more and more deck questions from you. The Fable will answer because he is a ninja! Well, first off, you need better lands. Secondly, I know that Oblivion Rings are awsome and all but your running an artifact deck, not an enchantment ot white weenie deck, they can be replaced with good artifacts. Third off, you need to even out your cards. I think thats about it. I lied today at school when I said I had no artifacts, I have quite a bit. Tomorrow you should spend the night (If my mom says yes) and then I will help you with your deck.

Then blow up about 10 balloons to the size of a softball; then pop about 5 of them with a pin; if your ok with that pop the other 5. If not wait till the next day. to pop the other five. you should keep popping them same size until you get used to it. Then increase the size to about double so that the balloon is still squishy so it wont be so loud; then blow up 10 and do the same thing until you get used to that. You might have to push yourself a Little when you start popping a full sized 11" balloon. just pop  two or three to start with; and push your self every day for a while until it's doesn't bother you. I the problem doesn't go away; maybe the problem isn't the loud popping sound; but that you just like balloons to be intact. And that's OK, a lot of people like balloons. you don't have to pop them to have fun with them. just keep them away from your dog. or if you want to let him pop them just Let him pop them out side.

s4YM3YFIaa	are you doing water parks aswell because sea world's new water park Aquatica is quite good and I love typhoon lagoon and blizzard beach    also Discovery Cove is an awesome trip you get free food all day anytime you want and you can snorkel with tropical fish, string rays and other stuff. you also get to swim in this like stream thing which is just fresh water and theres a beach sorta thing aswell and then you get to swim with the dolphins     you might wanna consider it coz ive recently been there on my 5th visit and we'd never done it before and now we know what we were missing.    the best hotel ive been to was caribbean beach hotel and port orleans riverside, they're both quite similar apart from port orleans you can get a boat to downtown disney which I love because there is so much to do, theres a new attraction coming out this year spring i think and the planet hollywood restraunt is the best but you'll need to book unless you wanna wait a long time. also if you stay in a disney hotel you get free access to the best place in downtown disney, Disney Quest, it has loads of arcade game in which you can play for free and loads of interactive games and well everything lol    and i know ive went on for a while but if you can find the sizzler and pondarosa buffet restraunts opposite it is this funfair kind of thing with quite a few good rides and shops!|`|2octF5dIaa	Go to a few water parks.  The best are Aquatica (Sea World) and Blizzard Beach (Disney).  Best hotel is the Boardwalk in at Disney, amazing location and such a great place.  The hotel has cool stuff from the 1920s and is on a boardwalk made to be like classic Atlantic City.  Its also very very very close to Epcot.  (5 minute walk).  It is a little more expensive than if you stay at like Holiday Inn on International Boulevard.   Tickets are available everywhere and are generally the same price but you can also buy multi-day tickets to save money.  Also, at Universal the City Walk next to both parks has great restaurants and stuff to do after a day at one of the two parks.  Have a great time!|`|iuY0sIL9aa	NASA is a good trip - not too far away.  See link below for Kennedy Space Center.    Perhaps a shuttle, or a rocket of some type, will be launched while you are there.

It's not a symbol of hate. If black was seen as bad, no one would let their kids play with a toy.   We should also beware of using overly sentimental language such as 'child's cherished' toy, as a child will treasure a piece of blanket if the mood takes. This is not the issue.  The golliwog was part of the history of multiculturalism. However, it was influenced more by the tradition of minstrels (white people painting themselves black to parody africans) rather than black history, and is thus deemed dated.  Although the changes this week may be deemed as 'PC gone mad', they can be seen as way to rethink how we represent and understand race in our society.|`|9GR84v2faa	Personally they look scary to me but I want to get one!

SEzIkGNiaa	To turn sims into plant sims, you will need the Seasons expansion pack.  To turn sims into werewolves, you will need the Pets expansion pack.  To resurrect a sim, you will need the University or Freetime expansion pack.    Plant Sims (How-to):    Step 1:  Go into build mode and select some garden plots or an orchard tree and for your lot. Garden plots cost 10 Simoleons apiece, while one orchard tree costs 1,200 Simoleons. Plant seeds in your garden plots.   Step2:  Spray your garden plot or tree with pesticide once the bugs start feasting. Click on the plot or tree and select "Spray." Do this repeatedly. You must overuse the pesticide to create a Plant Sim. After excessive spraying, your Sim eventually will become a green, leafy Plant Sim.   Step3: Create a new Plant Sim by spawning it from an existing Plant Sim. Click on your Plant Sim and select "Grow Plantbaby." A toddler Plant Sim will appear instantly.     Werewolves (How-to)    Step1:  Keep your eye out for the appearance of the Leader of the Pack wolf on your Sim's lot. The Leader of the Pack is the black wolf with the yellow, glowing eyes. He only comes out at night.   Step2:  Have your Sim go outside and greet the Leader of the Pack. Interact with him, using positive interactions, to boost your Sim's relationship score with the Leader.   Step3:  Continue to watch for the Leader each night. Your Sim probably won't reach the necessary 50 daily and 50 lifetime minimum score required to receive the nibble that will turn him into a werewolf in one night. Direct your Sim to go outside and interact with the Leader of the Pack as much as possible.   Step4:  Greet the Leader of the Pack once you have a relationship score of 50 daily and 50 lifetime and initiate a positive interaction. Wait for the Leader to give your Sim a nibble. As long as your Sim is in a good mood, she will accept the interaction and turn into a werewolf.     Resurrection (How-to)    To bring a Sim back, another Sim must first call the Grim Reaper. You will be given a choice of how much you will pay to bring the dead back. Children can only come back perfectly or not at all.     *  1 - 987: Resurrection fails, all money is lost.   *  988 - 4127: Sims return as Zombies, with needs not met and upset with the Sim who resurrected them to a Zombie. Most of the skills they previously had, are lost, along with their personality. They are given a standard Zombie personality.   *  4128 - 8512: Sims return with reverse personalities (Sims once active, will be lazy) and lost skill points.   *  8513 - 10000: Sim returns exactly as they left, with their personality and skill points in tact.    Have Fun!|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	you must use pesticides in order to turn your sims into plant people (or you could download the skin type from one of the sims websites) and in order to turn into a werewolf you must have pets two installed in order to be able to get bite by a dog...and you can go to the grim reaper to pay him to resurrect your sim...thats only if he/she has dies on unprobable causes...such as a fire...not if they were at old age|`|9CLRMnhSaa	idk for the plant and wolf   but if die g 2 grim reaper and pay 100 dollas|`|aZEG6cBWaa	you need the resurrect o nomitron to resurrect a person, this is the reward for getting high in the paranormal track. it is also at the secret societies in sims university. once you have it, call the grim reaper using it. the more you pay him, the person will come back more normal. if you don't pay him very much, your sim will return as a zombie.

(an entertainment center on top for instance not inside the glass enclosure)     second go to gamestop, or walmart, or even hastings, and buy a fan that will connect to the back of the 360 you can find it in the electronics department, or gamestop will show you exactly where one is. I just RECENTLY got a 360 but my brother in law still has his and he bought his the first week they were out.     He keeps his on top of his entertainment center with that external fan he bought from game stop and it still works like a champ!    third if you want to ensure over heating doesn't happen. Get a pillow case or some sort of cloth and when your not using your 360 cover it up to prevent dust from building up and being drawn once you boot the 360 up. Changing out the pillow case ever week. Just take it off when you play.     follow those steps and your 360 should last you until your bored of it, or the microsoft 720 or whatever name they give it comes out!|`|pcY9Ep2Taa	it does that when ever there are power shorts your fine man.....|`|RB7RjINwaa	That sucks. Sorry man. It basically means that the motherboard in the Xbox has overheated. The only way to sort it out is send it back to Xbox HQ with a note explaining the situation and they'll fix it and send it back. Many Xbox's do this because Microsoft cut corners and installed a cheap fan instead of a good one. It's cost them millions in repairs. They do it for free I think because it's their own fault. Remember to put your address in.|`|CopRCxSCaa	this happened to me a while back, it started giving me the red rings sporadically and soon it was stuck to it and i had to send it into microsoft to get a replacement. although they make the sending process very easy it is still a hassle and a couple weeks without ur xbox|`|U2nVrGm1aa	generally this means you have hardware problems try this|`|fvamen09aa	Aww man, this is the ONE AND ONLY flaw with 360s.

If you search on the internet for solutions for this issue there will be stuff like the 'tea towel trick' although i have seen this work first hand i would just recommend going onto the xbox website and finding the 3 red lights section where u will be able to phone them up for a repair. All you have to do is make an appointment for UPS to come and pick ur BARE console up where it will be taken to a xbox fixing centre (i live in England and they took mine to Berlin) and i waited 3 weeks or  so and it came back completely fixed and fine. they even replaced the disc drive (i didn't know was broken).

We own both.    Xbox-360 is a workhorse but then you have the dreaded 'red ring of death'.  Tons of games and accessories.  And the warranty has been extended to three years.    PS3 is brilliant technology and you can play games and movies on it.  The movies are expensive but should come down.  There are more and more games out every month.  Downside, ours has broken down three times.  Once within four months of each other.  Once the warranty expires you are left with a bill of $150 plus tax to fix and the warrant for that is only three months.    We love them both but for technology, PS3 rules (the breakdowns suck but otherwise a great machine for both gaming and movies).|`|Se6ikPhTaa	PS3 is way better in my prefference i hate this question because it's always about Preference not which one is better! my Prefference is PS3 for BLu-ray with free updates, free online, Playstation Home, great games, and everything else that's awesome about it.|`|RPa1LhNqaa	xbox is cheaper and it has a much better online experience|`|WOM8ZavGaa	XBOX 360    FYI: I know other people have complained about the Red Ring of Death.

KezRray7aa	If both of your characters are in the same account, you can use the Storage Keeper which are located in most towns. You would put all the items in your storage (up to four items) for 100 Mesos each. Then, you would relogin as your second character to retrieve the items you put in from your first character.     You can also send packages through Duey, however, this costs much more than simply putting your items in storage. Duey gives you a limited time to retrieve the item you sent, so be sure to check whether or not you have received the item as soon as possible.    You can also have a friend trade with you. Have them hold all the items from your first character that you would like to get on your second character. Then retrade them from your second character. This is usually done in the Free Market (FM) since players located on basically any map can easily get there.|`|3EBKrVrDaa	I'm not sure but maybe the storage is multi-character.|`|jUqjg0ytaa	you can send it though a truck or put it in the storagge ban

V700FIzGaa	Warhammer paints are acrylic - I  and they just don't get on so I use (mostly) Humbrol enamels which are smellier and need white spirit for cleaning brushes as opposed to the acrylics. A friend is the opposite, he gets great results with acrylics and terrible with enamels.     For over all spray painting I sometimes use Halford's tins of ready mixed spray paint. Be careful here, most car spray paint is now acrylic but if it's cellulose based your model will turn into one big glob of dissolved plastic.     Halfords do a basic white undercoat in acrylic spray which will do the job, then your top coats can be either acrylics by Warhammer, Humbrol or Revell or enamels, or even a mix of both.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    That would be ideal, At the moment Tamiya have recalled there's to sort out the proprllant and new ecc regs.

CKRfaRYvaa	m_brink is right.  You can download the games files for free, but each campaign requires its own activation key.  Without a valid activation key for each campaign you will not be able to play.  And Guild Wars is pretty good about keeping an eye out for scammers, so if you do somehow illegally obtain access it's likely that they will cancel your entire account including your original Guild Wars stuff.|`|uctxzjIIaa	All the data on the disks can be downloaded for free just by adding the " -image" command line parameter to your Guild ars shortcut and running that.    What you are actually buying is the account key, as that is what gives you the authority to access the content of the other parts of the game. WIthout a Factions Account Key tied to your account, you can't play anything Factions. Same with Nightfall and Eye to the North.|`|7eI8DtuUaa	Im pretty sure it would still work. My dad downloaded the expansions to his and it works fine. There shouldn't be anything wrong with it.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	You have to have a key/code etc. for Factions and Nightfall as well for it to work.
9c5c12327f93153e5d90fcf1227eae83aa	I am far removed from being an expert and know what I am talking about, but I would imagine that if you live near a park, you could stop by the HR office and simply ask.  Leave a description with whomever you talk to (probably a receptionist or secretary) and explain that it's for a college course--keep in mind these are folks who attended college themselves and most of them enjoy giving out advice with regards to the industry (I'll talk about it with anyone who asks, but I'm not in HR.)    If you would like email addresses and there is a park near you, visit their website, especially the job openings section.  Usually email addresses are provided there.

8f14dbe62f8ead586930616d39054bbdaa	Level What & Where?    1-20 Chickens in Lumbridge Collect the feathers and bones they drop for a small profit and prayer experience.    1-30 Goblins in Lumbridge Although it is possible to start with goblins, they are harder to kill but have a higher profit rate compared to chickens.    10-30 Cows in Lumbridge, near the Crafting Guild, near the Draynor Village farming patch, or in the field at Gnomecopters. You can hide behind the troughs. You can collect the cowhides and bank either at Lumbridge, Al-Kharid, or you can bank at Falador or Draynor. The Gnomecopter field is a great place to train since there are safe spots and there are four bank deposit boxes near the Gnomecopter pilots.    1-30 The NPCs behind bars at Port Sarim's jail Players cannot get back their arrows unless they can cast Telekinetic Grab.    20-50 Scorpions in the Dwarven mines Lots of spawns and low defence. The downside is that they have low health.    20-40 The wizards in the Wizards' Tower south of Draynor Village The mid-level is recommended as, although the wizards are especially vulnerable to archers in ranging armour, they can fight back at distance with moderate power.    20-40 Minotaurs in the Stronghold of Security Minotaurs are easy to kill from behind the fence. They drop iron and bronze arrows so the player will likely never run out of arrows.    30-40 Al-Kharid Warriors in Al Kharid Food may be needed though as this is a multicombat area and many warriors can attack the player simultaneously.    30-40 Barbarians in Barbarian Village Players can range them across tables in the bar.    30-40 Goblins in the Stronghold of Security Less suggested than minotaurs, as they drop little to nothing of value or use to a ranger.    30-50 or + Hobgoblins near Melzar's Maze Go on the other side of the island and shoot at hobgoblins. They cannot attack you.    30-50 or + Scorpions at the top of the volcano on Karamja Hide behind the entrance to the volcano cave and shoot down the scorpions on the mountains, they cannot attack you from there.    30-50+ Hill Giants in the Edgeville Dungeon There are several safe spots where you can range the giants without worrying about health.    40-50 Guards in or on Varrock Castle The second floor of the Port Sarim jail is another good spot, with 5 guards and obstacles.    40-50+ Cockroach workers in the Stronghold of Player Safety Players can range them while other players attack in a multi-combat zone. Players can range on them from a couple of safe spots without getting much damage done. They also provide a good source of runes which players can sell to mages or in G.E.    40-60 Flesh crawlers in the Stronghold of Security second level These monsters not only supply you with decent drops (be it ranarr, runes, noted iron ore, or other herbs), but they are weak against ranged attacks. Also, the other players with you may not pick up their own drops giving you even more. Varrock bank and Edgeville Bank are very close (or optionally, Grand Exchange).    40-65 White Knights in White Knights' Castle   (for players who haven't completed Wanted!) The centre of Falador. A good spot is on the 1st floor (2nd in North America) where there are cages so the White Knights can't harm you.    Black Knights in Black Knights' Fortress   (for players who have completed Wanted! , no matter non-members and members) Go up from the secret passage. The cage on that floor is a good spot to range. If players have Protect from melee and ranged-boosting prayer, go to the cell with 2 black knights connected to a room with altar on the same floor. Turn on prayer and recharge when it is zero.  Note: Killing white knights will deduct your black knight kills hence your rank.    40-80 Pirates in Asgarnian Ice Caves can be safespotted if high-level enough to make them unaggressive    50-99 Moss giants on Crandor Island A good spot to range from is in front of the bush near the coal and adamant rocks.  60-99 Ice giants in the Ice Cave A good spot to range from is in the south-east corner near some stalagmites. Ice warriors may still be able to reach you though. Also it might be really dangerous.    60-99 Lesser demons in Karamja's volcano A good spot to range from is from behind some stalagmites.    60-99 Black knights in the Black Knights' Fortress Players can range them across the table on the first floor.    60-99 Greater demons in the Wilderness Players can range them inside the ruins, as a best safespot, or while fighting the dark red ones, there's a safespot on the northern side of the ruins. For the purple one (not the purple eyed one), use the bones as a safespot. Be warned though, this is a Revenant hotspot.    80-99 Ankous in the Stronghold of Security Players can range them across a group of skeletons in the room west of the treasure room. Occasionally may drop 5-14 Adamant arrows.    65-99 Cockroach soldiers in the Stronghold of Player Safety Players can range them while other players attack in a multi-combat zone. The drops are among the best on f2p, so it is also a good moneymaker. While the soldiers have a high defence, they are not so resistant to ranged, providing easier kills. Be warned, though, that cockroach soldiers can also attack with ranged. They will actually hit harder with ranged than melee, with a maximum hit of 12 and 8, respectively. Therefore, it is advised to have a high defence or to wear some rune armour when fighting these.    70-99 Greater demons at the demonic Ruins Players have a large variety of safespots in the ruins, but due to revenants, players should not come here unless prepared, or have cheap armour|`|ckX5mGagaa	Go to the top of the wizard tower in a low-populated world, and kill the monster there.

plOfDn2qaa	I love reading, it's like watching a movie in your head. You envision the players, they can look like you. A good book is one that has a story that interests you and keeps you engaged. Read about something you enjoy - I love romance novels, but really good ones. Not harlequins or anything, thoughtful stories where the women are dealing with complex issues. I call it candy for the brain. It's not hard to do, it keeps me entertained and it's not heavy subject matter. I enjoy it because curling up with a good book is often more enjoyable than watching tv. And reading is something you can do on the go. At lunch at work, on the commute to work, in line, while waiting at the doctors. It's entertainment that fits into my purse.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	I once read a Pokemon story book and it was rad.|`|AA11880595	For entertainment I love to read it takes me to whereverr the characters go, you should try it!!|`|mTU4Idrsaa	I love to read because it gets me outside myself and into another world.

AA10226921	there are a couple ways to look at this.    dominion - which I have not played - is supposed to take the feel of CCG "drafting" and implement it well    Race for the Galaxy and san juan are good card games, I really like Race.  but there isn't anything in it that "attacks" your opponent...it really is a race to build the biggest and baddest empire...    Flying Frog productions has stated that both of their games...while board games have a big CCG influence on them...both last night on earth and a touch of evil have you collecting cards (both "instants" and items) to use for and against various players on the board    illuminatti was sold as both a collectible, and as a box-set with all the cards.   it is very different from magic...but is definetely a neat game and worth taking a look at.    Fantasy flight game has two card games that they call "living Card games" or LCG where the cards are sold in "sets" almost like expansions...so rather than the person who is buying the most gets the best cards, you just choose the set you want to play with.    This is specifically to target the CCG-type game without the buying tons syndrome that infects magic and others.  these two are A Game of thrones LCG and Call of Cthullu LCG    There are also handful of non-collectible card games that are supposed to have that same feel.  Blue moon, Cold War CIA vs KGB, Scarab Lords, and minotaur lords are all examples of this.  I haven't played, but know people who have and really enjoy them (especially blue moon)    and lastly...you could do what's called a draft.   in this there is a set number of cards, usually a box of unopened boosters or something, and everyone who is gonna play that night takes a set amount, opens them...picks a card (or so..) and passes the others around.    so you get the pick of the cards you have, then 2nd pick of your neighbors...and so on until all cards are chosen or all have a deck.|`|c817bcaf888e6d3f93554e52878656f3aa	I would take a look at Race for the Galaxy. It is plays up to four and provides a very satisfying game experience. The game itself is a civilization building game. You put planets into play and build up your empire while competing with the other players. It's non-collectible and will have a limited number of expansion sets (set 1 is already released and adds solo play plus a fifth player in addition to more cards).
QT6iRQNaaa	You can try http://www.rarityguide.com/forums/ a website where lots of collectors hang out, maybe someone will have that game for sale.
pKlKJR4qaa	Stop playing... its very, very very addictive...If you're at the state i was at, you're probably thinking of upgrading one of your resources right now.... i went on a holiday with my family to USA for a month but i didn't enjoy it as much as i could've because i went crazy because i couldn't see the state of my account, even now i still think of why i started playing it in the first place, it ruined the only holiday that i would go on with my whole family probably in my life. I would just stop, if you want a game... find one in realtime not ones where you have to wait and wait for your resources to build up in order to advance, play a game where you can go on and off without worrying about being attacked by someone else when you're offline.|`|K9EnwXP1aa	i kept playin and it never ends so i just didnt play anymore............i never got smthin like the thing u mentioned|`|E1UlIVtaaa	honestly, if you are sick of it, why continue to play??
Ex79fiD9aa	Because there are always people who will fall for it. Take a look at the questions in this section. Every day there are more questions from people asking if they really did win a lottery they never entered, just "inherited" huge sums of money, and who knows what else.    It's obvious there are tons of people who have no idea about those things being scams. At least the ones on this site are asking. The unfortunate ones who don't ask and jump right into it end up paying dearly.    The internet is the perfect tool for that sort of thing. Years ago they used phone calls, letters, and newspaper ads. Same scams, different methods.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	They mass-mail it to thousands, if just ONE responds  and takes the bait,  THEY have won the lottery!

cn68rflCaa	YES! i love making handmade cards.  Well if you have alot of schoolwork, maybe set a couple hours out of the weekend to make cards. Maybe do a couple cards a weekend so that when there is an occasion, you will have some cards ready.  Here is a website for some card making ideas.  http://www.bisous.biz/catalog/layout_1_c...   ^^^^^^  GOOD LUCK! and i hope this helped|`|1a6e641ed9d987f73b9eeff3805f12a6aa	Cheat a bit. Handmade cards are a very popular hobby now. There should be a selection of books in your local library with examples of different cards so you can adapt an idea rather than thinking one up from scratch. Many of the suppliers have galleries of cards on their websites. Docraft and Trimcraft have good ones and there are videos with demonstrations of how to make cards using different products.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	do them on a computer and just print off the basic design and colour them in|`|5wufIH1Haa	I really got into paper embroidery. It sounds hard but its SO easy! You just need cardstock and cross stitch floss, a punch needle, and things you want to add. The designs are made for cards so not only are you doing a craft that is quick and easy (for those of us who like instant gratification) you can sell, share, give these cards for ANY occasion. You'll never have to buy another card again and they are fun because you can add and do anything to them. I like to add different paper colors under it and shape them with ridged scissors.    Here is a link a book with patterns. Basically you photocopy the picture, punch the holes into a piece of card stock, follow the pattern to make the image, and glue to other card and and embellishments. Its easy! and you can easily do a card in less than an hour depending on the design and how intricate you make it. Have fun with it and experiment.    http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-t...

The flash-based version of the game operates under the same mechanic as the full-version of the PC game.<br>  <br>  In Little Farm, players click on a patch of the farm field and drag out the mouse to form a rectangle that has four patches of the same color in each corner. When the mouse is released, the rectangle is watered and the plants within it are harvested. Little Farm first debuted for digital download in May.<br>  <br>  “We are very excited to launch our first application for Facebook. Social networks are changing the face of casual games by bringing great games like Little Farm to the users rather than leaving it up to users to find us,” said Robert Einspruch, director of online business for MumboJumbo.<br>  <br>  The Little Farm application can be added to any Facebook profile by visiting <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/littlefarm." rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/littlefarm.</a> Players can invite friends and compare their scores through the application.<br>  <br>  Little Farm is also launching at retailers nationwide this month. It’s rated‘E’ for Everyone and the full version can be purchased for $19.99.|`|T3wenJ8daa	go to ZYNAGA website you'll find a list of games, couldnt find a farming game when i looked, closest to it though is yoville.|`|PFejQPb2aa	wtf u talkin bout? lol

AA11576752	How much wood would a woodchuck chuck   if a woodchuck could chuck wood?    The answer to this age old question has perplexed people for eons.    Part of the reason the question is so difficult to answer is that the amount of wood that woodchucks would chuck on a given day varies greatly with the seasons and with the metabolisms of any individual woodchuck.    Modern internet technology has advanced to the point that we can reliably monitor the amount a woodchuck chucks in real time.    The results of this monitoring are shown below.  Please note that the numbers vary due to the dispositions of the woodchucks involved.    Attention: Woodchucks don't chuck unless you use Microsoft Internet Explorer as your browser.... Netscape scares them.    Average amount of wood a woodchuck would chuck in a given day 679 butt cords of wood.    Median amount of wood a woodchuck could chuck in a given hour 501 butt cords of wood.    Record high for woodchuck wood chucking of 4507 butt cords  was attained on  6-15-1996.

Then slide then apart pushing them in opposite directions while still touching them together firmly. As they seperate you should hear the "snapping" noise. The firmer you press your thumb and middle finger together as you slide them in opposite directions the louder the "snap" will be too. What happens is the middle finger snaps down and hits the base of your thumb.|`|4dbc238483fca10fba834b4b76e27375aa	qoute " Question -   When you click your fingers how does the sound happen, is  it to do with the friction of your to fingers or the slapping of your  finger and hand?  --------------------------------------...  The friction from your fingers rubbing together can be heard briefly before  the snap, as a whisking sound.  The snap itself is from the impact of your  finger against your palm.    Ryan Belscamper  ======================================...  The slapping impact, absolutely.  The friction would only make a faint brief rubbing or hissing noise,  and we know we hear more than that.    If your finger broke away quickly enough  from its position locked to the thumb by friction,  then the acceleration of the surface area of the finger  might in principle be able to make a sudden sharp loud noise.  But I am sure that the real break-away is not that abrupt.    And you can try for yourself:     snap your fingers but be sure the finger misses the palm.

Also make sure that you have patched up on both computers (http://www.blizzard.com/patches/ )    Also make sure that you are selecting the Local Area Network UDP, not IPX.  If you don't see this option, then you're not patched up.    You also want to make sure that any firewalls on your system (Windows XP Firewall, for instance) are configured to allow port 6112 udp.  If you're on windows XP, be sure to see here: http://www.blizzard.com/support/?id=msi0... .  You need to be sure that ALL of the firewalls are configured.

0DrKZvJaaa	This is all up to you, you will need to log on and experiment with the classes and races to find what suits you best. There isn't technically a magic and fighter based class. It's either caster or melee or range. But shaman and paladin are types of fighters with multiple spells at your arsenal. Druid may be best if you want to do magic and melee as you get animal forms, most of which are melee. And you will find yourself changing your home town often as to meet the new quests and creature levels in that area. As for builds best in solo and grouping hunter and warlock are by far the easiest to level alone with as you get a pet/minion that will distract the enemy while you pummel them from afar or close.<br>  <br>  For groups, healers are peoples favorites, druid,priest,shaman,paladin all have healing builds available. Experiment and find what interests you the most.|`|DKnJRYZgaa	Whats a good starting class in good alignment- Night elf hunter for alliance, or orc hunter for horde... alliance if you like raiding and social people, horde if you like pvp.

Ok to level and definatly benefit groups.  They can do damage, heal, or be a "tank".  If you are a tank, groups love paladin tanks, and soloing is easy oo because of the AOE damage.<br>  <br>  It's a melee class that uses spell power to increase your damage.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	whats a good starting class in good alignment.<br>  <br>  For a first class I would make a rogue, mage, priest or hunter. These are the easiest classes to get the hang of. Rogues are good for doing a lot of damage, and escaping combat. Mages are also good for damage, but die easier. Priests do decent damage, and have the advantage of bubbles and heals. Hunters are a good damage class that are very easy to play.<br>  <br>  where should i put as my hometown<br>  <br>  set you home town to a town that's close to where you're questing. If I'm playing alliance I'll use have my hearth stone set to Goldshire until about level 11, and then on eof the main cities, Stormwind or Ironforge so I can easily get to the bank, auction house, vendors, flight masters, etc. When you get to Northrend, set it to Dalaran so you can use the portals there.  <br>  <br>  what race<br>  <br>  Race doesn't make a lot of difference. You can see each classes racial abilites here -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/races/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/race...</a><br>  <br>  If you plan on doing a lot of PvP choose a race with good PvP abilities. Gnomes for example have escape artist which lets them get out of a crowd control, Night Elves have shadowmeld, and humans have perception that increases their chance of seeing stealthed players. If you want to PvE, choose a race with good PvE racials. All in all though, it doesn't make that much difference.<br>  <br>  what build will benefit the most from soloing and grouping<br>  <br>  It will depend on your class, and if you want to mostly level by instancing or questing. If you're a class that can tank or heal and want to instance a lot, spec prot or holy and you will find groups a lot easier. Otherwise spec for damage.<br>  <br>  i like to play as magic users and fighters in same build<br>  <br>  Paladins and druids are both magic users that also use physical attacks.

aKUssnxQaa	I had the same problem...<br>  <br>  My Xbox 360 isn't close to my DSL Router (and I'm too cheap to spend $100 on that overpriced Microsoft Wireless Adapter), so I rarely connect my Xbox 360 online. I connected online, created an Xbox Live account and downloaded "The Lost and The Damned" expansion pack.<br>  <br>  After successfully downloading, it wouldn't play -- no matter what I tried...<br>  <br>  Long story short, while you're still connected to Xbox Live, insert your GTA IV game disc and start the game. It will stop and tell you that there's an update that you need to install.<br>  <br>  Once that update is installed, you don't need to be connected to Xbox Live anymore (to play the single-player version.) You can then choose between the regular game and the expansion pack.<br>  <br>  (I wish they would have explained that, when you downloaded the game...)|`|PFejQPb2aa	call 360 ppl and if they say they cant do n e thing bout it start bitchin and they will lol|`|SuKS1OQtaa	When the original game starts you must pause the game and start a new game.

nP6QXbCsaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I had the same problem but I just figured it out. To fight Gouken you must beat the game with every character in the game, that includes Akuma. You probably unlocked Akuma and haven't beaten the game with him yet.<br>  <br>  Here what happened to me.<br>  I beat the game with all characters, then did a Easiest 2 rounder Arcade run with Ryu. I got 3 Ultra Combos and 3 perfects.. I don't think you need to do that many for Akuma .. I just did that many.<br>  <br>  Akuma came out and I beat him, he was then unlocked for me. I started another run in Arcade (still with Ryu) with the same settings and did 3 Ultras and 3 perfects again.. but the game just ended... I did it again with Akuma.. and AGAIN the game just ended... thats when I figured it out. It was the first time I had beaten the game with Akuma.. and so it was not registered. I played one more time with Akuma 3 Ultras and 3 Perfects and there he was, Gouken.<br>  <br>  Try that.. making sure that you beat the game first with Akuma, as he is also one of the characters you must beat the game with before Gouken appears.|`|xjkb1kJraa	beat arcade mode with all characters then you'll get akuma then play akuma in arcade and do 3 ultra finishers and 3 perfects and you find gouken and if you want seth do the the same with gouken as you did with akuma

i210xqkgaa	resident evil 4 was one of the best shooting games of all times. i liked how they managed to fix every single problem from the previous titles. and there were a LOT of problems too. brain-dead foes, horrible tank controls, and awful voice acting. yet somehow they still managed to be fun. resident evil 4 on the other hand had pretty smart ai, a great behind the back camera, wonderful voice acting, and some of the coolest bosses i've ever seen on a shooting game. RE4 also had a pretty deep storyline, great graphics, and so much enemy variety. despite disappointingly not being scary at all, the enemies and parasites were so freaky looking. the bosses were bigger and badder, the graphics were so detailed, the story was so compelling, and the gameplay was some of the best i had ever experienced. the game took me nearly 23hours to beat too. i also enjoyed how much bonus material was unlocked from beating the game.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	YES!

You can have fun while competing with others in tournament/challenge for higher scores.
KU5SB6Tlaa	Most likely just to maintain the story quality.  In a lot of games they do this.  They just include it to add to the realism, because just like real-life, we know things that we cannot access, like past events, things happening in Europe, etc.<br>  <br>  It's all to add to the realism and worldview of the game.|`|pbMnfypEaa	safe to assume from the numbers(correct me if older fallouts contradict this) that there are atleast the highest numbered vaults ammount of vaults. most arent in the game as the game world is restricted in size. mayb they were destroyed or simply buried in the nuclear blasts

jYEbbrcaaa	Try pulling it out with your fingers or with pliers if its that tough to get out. Or look for a place where you can find the piece you need to use to take it out.|`|VqJrKA8caa	You don't need any plastic thing to help take out the expansion pack. Just pull out the one in there, then put the other one in. <br>  <br>  I have to admit that I'm a bit confused with your wording though. If you mean that you lost your expansion pack, you can buy another one here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expansion-Pak-Nintendo-64/dp/B00000INR2/ref=pd_sim_vg_1/182-6682424-3927124" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Expansion-Pak-Nint...</a><br>  <br>  Also, new Donkey Kong 64 games come with an expansion pack, so if you buy a new copy of the game online, you get the game plus an expansion pack for cheap. <br>  <br>  Here's a link to donkey kong 64: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-64-nintendo/dp/B00002STEZ" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-64-nin...</a><br>  Actually, I was wrong about DK 64 being cheap, but you can always check the used links (they're 8.64 about for a used copy, $100 for a new one) and see if they offer the expansion pack as well. At any rate, it's a good game =P<br>  <br>  So really.. to pull out the expansion pack, turn off the power, and there should be a clip you can use on the expansion pack to help pull it out. If not, you could maybe use a flathead screw driver if you're careful.|`|6difexIJaa	The removal tool?  Fingernail.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't listen to the person above me.  Get a real job if you need money.

7Ca2ns47aa	Yes, used from Gamestop, or online... from like Amazon or e-bay. I got one for Christmas this last year and it was bought from Gamestop. I think my copy still cost like 40 bucks... and yes it was used. I got my Collector's Edition on e-bay like over a year ago for less than 20 bucks... it was in amazing condition.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Buy it used from Gamestop.|`|e494eb1e544153fbeed8117f34b95807aa	if you get used games from game stop they are mostly WAY cheaper then if they are not used
JWz5ZWimaa	You can't build barricades anymore. They patched it so the barricades are temporary. The forklift truck on the floor below the roof on No Mercy can block the way to the safe room, but after sometime of trying to get past it will simply move aside.<br>  The game is also one of the only games I have seen that lends itself to being virtually hack proof. You can glitch, but hacking is almost non existent.<br>  I think you may find that the instructions from Google or YouTube are out of date. The problems are slowly being ironed out.<br>  Just look forward to the Spring update when they finally bring in Blood Harvest and Death Toll on versus. And a new mode, Survival.
