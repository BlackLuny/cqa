They could make things easier by adjusting the program to the standard preferences of the individual user, but instead they just change the appearance and with regards to the functions etc they conveniently reissue the same stuff (almost).

20090307152207AAMiTL6	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What's the best CPU now?	It seems quad core is better than dual core.   But the program I have doesn't require quad core so I am looking for a dual core with the highest clock speed.   But I think the highest clock speed is always overpriced, and maybe twice more expensive than the 2nd best one so I think it's better to pick the 2nd best dual core CPU in market.   Where can I find the spec and prices of good CPU?      and is quad core twice better than dual core as long as the program supports quad core?      and does windows xp support quad core? it came out before quad core so i wonder if quad core actually runs xp better than dual core.      one more question I have is, does intel and AMD have diff speed even if they have the same clock speed? if so, which is better in how much?      Thank you very much.

20090307152147AAYXtMn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Question for those experienced with XP Booting...?	(Detailed for a reason)      I have an old desktop with Windows XP SP3 with 256 MB RAM, and we got it a couple years back. It works efficiently, no BIG problems except that Alcra.B Worm it got when my brother fell in love with P2P Limewire garbage. It's worked like a charm since I've fixed it. And that was the beginning of last year.      Recently, we bought a Vista desktop and had a whole bunch of wires all over the place between the tv, the two desktops, the printer, the modem and router and the phone.       I had it up and on IE7 when I accidentally turned off the wrong circuit/junction/it's called that holds many plugs. When I turned it back on, this underscore blinked for a few minutes before it finally booted up.       My question is, is this a big but repairable problem, a small repairable problem, nothing to worry about, or something really bad and irreversible? If it's something to worry about, can you please tell me what to do so I can fix it?

It's been like this for months, and after my dad promised 3 times to take a look at it but never has, I've decided I'm going to try and fix it.    I have a Dell Vostro 1500 laptop, and I have my screen saver set to "Aurora" and wait 10 minutes and the "On resume, display logon screen" box unchecked.    Yet, the screen saver isn't coming up. I had my laptop left on all night last night, and it didn't even go to sleep. I came downstairs over 24 hours later to get on and it was still on, with my picture in my background up and ready to go, all my icons still there like I had just turned on my laptop. No screen-saver, no automatic shut down.    Could you please help me get my screen saver to work?   Thank you in advance!

20090307113632AAOGxf1	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	I need help with my linksys router! Please!?	Okay we have a linksys router and only a MacBook Pro for our home. The software for our linksys is for PC only so we can't setup a password on our router (I don't know of any anyway).      The problem is we just moved into a new apartment complex and someone is stealing our internet hard core. It looks like they're playing movies or games online because the send and receive lights are going crazy all the time.      My husband and I started shutting off both our router and our modem whenever we aren't using it to peeve them off and maybe make them get their own but it obviously didn't work because today when I turned on my modem and router "linksys" wouldn't show up in my airport dropdown menu. THEN I realized that there was one showing up but it was PASSWORD PROTECTED!      At first I thought "there is no way someone else put a password on my own router because it would have had to be reset when they did it but if they did it when it was on the last time then I turned it off and turned it back on it could have done it right? I checked the back of the router and the security light (little lock looking thing) was lit up!!!! I'm so mad that someone would do this! I had to reset the router 3 times before that light went off and GO FIGURE all the sudden linksys was showing up in my airport as no password protected anymore.      My first question is how would someone even do that?! Second, how can I put as much security on my linksys rounter/internet in general so that this can't happen again using my MAC. I have no access to a PC so a way to us my MAC to do this is my only option. I'm just at my wits end and ready to go banging on everyones doors to find this person! So any help would be greatly appreciated!      Also, I know there's a way to see if any other IP addresses are using my internet. But not sure what to look for. I go to my airport dropdown menu and hit "open network preferences", then under "airport" hit "advanced", then I go to TCP/IP and it shows me "IPv4 address" which is my address but I also see something under that that says "subnet mask" with some address in it then the Router address thing. Would any of these show me the other person's IP address or do I need to be looking somewhere different?      THANK YOU!

I have a Compaq desktop computer, and I'm trying to connect it to my wireless linksys router. My laptop in the other room connects to it fine. So I went to the "network troubleshooting" window in the desktop computer, and it told me to click on the "networks" icon, and then search for the "wireless networks" icon. However, everytime I do this, the only things that appear in the networks menu are "LAN area connection" and some "1394 connection" crap. No "wireless connection" option appears at all. This desktop computer is only about 3 years old, so I'm sure it includes some type of wireless capabilities, or a wireless card. Otherwise, why would the help menu suggest that I search for the "wireless connections" tab if it didn't include a wireless card by default in the computer? I dunno, I'm so confused. Should I buy a card, or is there something I should be doing on the computer itself to recognize my router? Thanks for any help...

I didn't recognize the name, or the display picture, but considering that a lot of people have a lot of random stuff on MSN, it didn't really catch my eye.      But then he started talking to me. I opened the conversation window and realize that I didn't recognize the e-mail address. I said hi back anyways, hoping that they would clarify who they were for me. He asked how I was, and I said I was fine, he then told me that he was "horny, but good".      I responded with an "oh...", he then asked me where I was from. I knew that there were issues with this. So I told him that I didn't remember adding him as a friend, and that he was a perv and a creeper. He immediately logged off.      So, my question is: How did he get my e-mail? How did he get on my list? AND should I report him to MSN?

20090227083248AAHzhN5	Computers & Internet;Security	How to I get rid of these poppups/virus?	A few weeks ago my computer got infected with vundo. It would slow down, and every time I used the internet, popups would appear in separate windows almost every time I clicked on a link. I use firefox. I scanned a few times with AVG ad-aware. They would always find the virus, something called virtumonde, and a few registry entries it had created. However after finding it, I would delete them, but they would be there next time I scanned. Eventually I got rid of it by booting the computer in safe mode and manually deleting the registry entries/files, and it seemed clean for a week or so.      However, since yesterday the pop ups have come back. Except instead of opening up in Firefox like they did before, these pop ups open up in Internet explorer. I have done full scans with AVG and Ad-aware, and neither have found anything at all. The pop ups range from child support websites to dating for married couples, and seem to be completely random

I'm planning to purchase new PC I did some shoping in jordan and I have some questions, please respond even if you don't have answers to all the questions, thank you for taking the time,      First of all, Here is the parts I am considering to buy:      1. E7400 Intel Core2 Duo Processor   2. Gigabyte Motherboard G31 Intel Chipset   3. 4GB DDR2 667   4. ATX P4 Case      The above will cost me around 387$, I Intend to use on-board graphics and sound and ethernet, since I don't need high-end 3D performance as I don't play Games.      Secondly, this is what I Intend to do with my computer:   1. Play movies and audo   2. Video editing   3. Video encoding   4. Office or other productivity   5. Multi-task a lot, like listening to music, while downloading files or burning or encoding at the same time.      My questions are the following:   1. Will I be able to play 720p and 1080p video efficiantly?   2. Do you think 387$ is a lot to pay for these parts?   3. If i down-grade the processor to E5200, I will save 49$ do you think that is a good or bad cost saving considering what performance I will loose and the things I want to use my computer for? I can't find any performance charts comparing the E5200 to E7400 so I don't know how much performance I am going to loose with the E5200 if you have some reviews with performance tests please give me a link.   4. I need some price comparasions between E7400, E6850 and E8000 series   5. I read on intel's site, that G31 supports HDMI output, but when I asked my vendor who uses Elite and Gigabyte motherboards and ATX P4 Case, that there is no HDMI interface with this motherboard or case, how can i get HDMI support do I have to use a difirent motherboard manufactorer or a difirence case?   6. Does Graphic Media Accelerator x310 which comes with the G31 chipset support a resolution of 1366 x 768? this is so I can hock up my Graphic output to the Sharp Aquos LC-42PX5M to view movies
20090307125050AAnyQMs	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How limited am I to making / editing videos?	I'm trying to make a fan music video for a certain song. However, I have never used any video editing program or any experience with making a video (other than Windows Movie Maker).      What are some great programs for me to get for video editing?   And how limited am I with that program if I just shoot a footage with a video from a digital camera?      For example, lets say I take a footage with me opening up a bush, can I edit that footage with a program so that the camera acts like it just goes inside the bushes really fast and the whole scenery changes like I went underground or something? Do I need like a green screen for something like that or can it be done with video editing?      Another option I'd like to know if its possible without addition camera techniques and purely done on the program itself, I'd like to make the video 'stutter' like its just a flip book going really fast. Like the music video of radiohead- there there ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs1DX32t3...       Pretty much I have a video recorded from a digital camera, how limited am I if I just use a video editing program and not use extra cameras and such?

20090307123839AATt6lE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I Am Having Mouse Problems?	I just did some maintenance on my laptop the other day that required me to removed the keyboard. I reinstall the keyboard and it worked fine. My laptop has a "hockey puck" mouse which is attached to the keyboard. It also has a touchpad mouse below the keyboard. I was working today when the mouse on my computer went crazy. When I would try to used the "hockey puck" mouse, it would move to the left side of the screen and wouldn't let me move it back anywhere else. The rest of the keyboard works fine, but the "hockey puck" mouse doesn't work correctly. My USB mouse and the touch pad work fine though. The other weird thing is that, even though I disabled the "hockey puck" mouse in BIOS, it still sends inputs to my computer. I am 100% certain that the problem is with hardware and not any settings.

Maybe this section will return more answers! =]      I was playing 'TrackMania Nations Forever' and I thought I would like to make a server with my own tracks! So I made a few tracks, went through the basic setup process of choosing which tracks I want to include,    (e.g. How long each track goes on for, Max players, Which tracks I want to include etc.)    Clicked launch and I got an error message that said something along the lines of "This is a private match. To play online with others players you will need to configure your NAT"   Something like that anyway... I've tried loads of times so don't say just try again.      My point is, I'm guessing this NAT thing is something which denies outside access to my tracks or something O.o I dunno. So I was wondering if mine is set to strict or something. If this is the case how can I make it more lenient and allow me to launch my server?       Oh and keep it simple if possible! =P Thanks.      ***ONE LAST THING... If nobody knows the answer to this could you please suggest which section I put it in instead so I can get better answers!***

20090307134428AA0agc2	Computers & Internet;Security	A Virus that prevents my internet from working....?	I had Spyware Protect 2009 on my computer last week.  I dl'd and ran malware on my computer.  I turned off system restore, changed the name of the malware, ran it, and removed all of the viruses from my computer (or so I thought).  Additionally, i used norman and super-antispyware program that removed the remaining threats on the computer.  Afterwards, I turned system restore back on and everything was fine again.       Now a week later, I have a continous problem with opening any of my many web browsers on my computer.  I know it is not my modem, because the comcast modem i have has 3 other computers all hooked up to the same modem without any internet browser problems what-so-ever.  Additionally, i reset my modem, switched ends on the internet cable, switched ports, and called the service provider and they all didnt yield any better results.  However, when I unplugg the power from the modem and plug it back into the modem, it resets my ip address and allows me to open 1 internet browser, however its extremely slow, and as soon as i close out that 1 window, i can't reopen the browser again or use any other ones for that matter.      Also, i went back to safe mode, re-ran the malware, super-antispyware, and norman one more time, yet no infections were found.  What should I do?  What is potentially preventing my internet browser and internet from working properly?

I've already managed to unzip the downloaded font file and its in its own little folder under My Documents right now. I tried to drag and drop it into the Fonts file under the control panel and I get a little pop-up that says      "the *******.TTF file is currently being used and cannot be replaced. Wait until Windows is finished using the file, then try again."      I also tried to right click the file and select "open with" and selected Microsoft Word. Microsoft word opens and a box comes up titled File Conversion and tells me to "select the encoding that makes your document readable. I tried to click Other Encoding>OEM United States and selected OK, but its just a bunch of random jibberish funny letters and what not....Please help me.

So there was no problem UNTIL I ran WPA_ KILL to get rid of that 30 day activation for windows. Well after that windows would not work and so i reinstalled windows on the partition that the previous windows was in. So no changes were made to ubuntu 8.10 or anything, but i think it took out grub bootloader b/c it doesnt give me an option to boot to ubuntu 8.10 and i really want to know how to get it back without reinstalling both os's.

20090307131336AAA3pjB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Toshiba Satellite 1405 Series issue.?	Here we go...      I have a Toshiba Satellite 1405-S151 series laptop with a newly installed 250GB hard drive, 768MB (one 256MB and one 512MB stick) of memory, the precessor is a 1.2 GHz Celeron. I know Celeron's spell trouble, but it's all I have.      My issue is that my CPU is constantly running at 100%. Occasioally it will drop back down, but for the most part, it hangs out at the peak. Anything that I open or run, the CPU usage spikes. I can sit here and stare at the computer, and the processor spikes. The only major process that is using alot of the CPU is the "System Idle Process." The mrory is running at around 115MB idle. So, the memory isn't an issue. I have Windows XP Professional SP2 installed and all current security updates (aside Service Pack 3) installed. I don't remember having this problem with the 60GB hard drive installed. But unless it was failing, I don't see how the hard drive could be contributing.      If anyone has any knowledge that could help, I'd greatly appreciate it.      Also, if anyone knows if I could change out the CPU with a P4 or something, that would be great too.      Thanks a bunch.

I'm a Computer Systems Administrator, and a Network Administrator.   But I need some help with this.   I am on a Dell Inspiron 400, also a Dell Vostro 400, and a Compaq V5000. Working on 2 different Networks.  All Windows XP, SP3, all recent updates, IE7, and some other things depending upon the computer.      Ok, here's the thing,  you turn on any of the computers, and you will have a network connection, and be able to surf the net on IE7.  But sometime you will be playing a game, watching a movie, or just some other inane activity.  And after a period of time, sometime extended, sometime brief, you will lose the ability to browse the web, or check email, or a multitude of other activities.  But you can still "Ping" or do a "TraceRT" outside of your network.       Ok, any thoughts?

20090307142606AAyPAK1	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What to do with a broken laptop (Powerbook G4 Aluminium)?	Hi everyone.      Background: Late 2007, my Powerbook G4 (Aluminium) ceased to function properly (booting it up resulted in a blank screen followed by three beeps and simultaneous flashing). A failed logic board was the culprit. Thankfully it was under the final year of its extended warranty. If it had not of been, I would have faced paying a hefty sum of approximately ￡600, though I’m sure the cost of repair was more, perhaps ￡800.      A few days ago, the same thing happened again. Now it is out of warranty. The laptop is a little more than 4 years old. I do not know for certain that the problem is logic board related, but, given the potential cost of diagnosis and repair on top of the laptop’s age, I cannot see the justification in repairing it.      Other than recover what I can from the Hard Drive, I’m at a loss as to what to do with it now. All suggestions are welcome. I’d rather not have to attempt a ‘DIY’ repair job on it though.      Thanks in advance.

20090307141855AAUxe7o	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What is causing my Advent 7101 laptop to shut down suddenly?	I recently sold my Advent 7101 laptop to my wife's Aunt. At the time it was working fine. She soon told me it was playing up but rather than let me see it, got her "computer expert" friend to put in a new hard drive.  After giving it back to me and asking for a refund, it now it won't operate for more than about 10 mins before displaying an error message and then shutting down suddenly. Her "computer expert" friend seems to think the processor is faulty but when I run a check on the Devise Manager all appears fine.  The error message says: "A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. A process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited or been terminated. If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again follow these steps: Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need. If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select Safe Mode. Technical information: ***STOP: 0x000000F4 (0x00000003, 0x85B4CDA0, 0x85B4CF14, 0x805c8BFC).  Beginning dump of physical memory. Physical memory dump complete."   Does all this mean the Laptop is dead (or dying) or just that the new hard drive is causing the sudden shutdowns???

But it's the music on the menus, they're different -- they're instrumental versions of some of the band's songs -- ya know, without the vocals.   Well, I was wondering if there's a way to get the music from the menus onto my computer alone? I've searched and searched to see if they've already been on the net, but no luck. So is there a way I could get them off my own dvd? I have a Mac Book but no special programs, that I know of, that could do this...   Thank you.

I ve taken off my wall and info as I ve decided my friends should already know enough about me and why does everyone need to read the messages my friends write to me. So now it's inbox only which is funny as I get less messages now.       I feel so many people play up to facebook as they have an audience like two friends in work they say they miss each other in thier status updates and talk baby talk to each other on thier walls.       You get annoucements over facebook which friends would normally have phoned you or text aout eg engagements , pregancies , when friends have chosen bridesmaids.       You find out when our friends have met without you which is fine am 28 and have quite a few friends so it doesn't bother me but before we wouldn't have known about every little thing .       People don't have privacy so when they post a message you end up reading it in news feed and some friends are so childish it's like they want you to read it . And when friends say they not speaking to someone you 'll see how fake they are with each other it's pathetic.       I don't wana delete it as got in touch with lots of old friends but for the sake of my friendships I wana beat the addicton and stop uisng it so much.       So is it me or are freinds getting childish on facebook over competitive and is it ruining our relationships?

I have tried several times to install the SP1 through Windows Update, but each time it would stuck a 98% of Stage 1 of 3 or something like that, and 3 hours later tell me it hasn't installed and reverting changes. I also noticed that after each installation try, a new directory with random letters and numbers was created in root directory.      I have checked Event Viewer and we noticed these errors occuring during the SP1 installation:      "Windows Servicing identified that package KB936330 (Service Pack) is not applicable for this system."      "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error querying for the IVssWriter Callback interface.hr = 0x 80070005. This is often caused by incorrect security settings in either the writer or requestor process."      "The target file for the Windows Feedback Platform (a DCC file containing the list of problems on this computer that require additional data collection for diagnosis) could not be parsed. The error code was 8014FFF9."      "The print spooler cannot start because the PrinterBusEnumerator could not start. Error code 0x 80070006. This can occur because of system instability or a lack of system ressources." (this one I saw more than one time)      I had checked Windows Update, HP Update and HP Health Check for other updates prior to SP1, and I installed all of them without any problems.       I have a AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition version 8.0.237 and I don't have any viruses on my computer (I scan it every day).

20090307155422AAfOlEi	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why is my laptop so slow?	Often when I copy or delete files, it will stay for an hour blocked in the Calculating Remaining Time dialog box, and Windows Explorer is slow and very often stops responding and has to restart.      When I search for a file or when I open a program, it takes a while to do it, and sometimes I have to open the program many time until it finally responds, but then it results with the program not responding and blocking everything...      It's very annoying. Also my iTunes version 8 takes a very long time to open and stops responding a lot. When I connect my iPod Touch, it takes an hour to connect with it and sync it, and the iTunes Store takes hours to load and to stream song previews, constantly stopping and streaming and continuing and streaming again...         Internet is the same. Even Yahoo Answers' home page can take a while to load, and Youtube videos are a pain in the @ss: they load so slowly that I have viewing the video takes less time than streaming it, leading to stopping it at the middle of the video, to wait an hour to continue the streaming... I use a Wifi connection to my own Linksys router protected with a password, and my iPod's Safari Browser also takes forever to load a page with the same router.         Thanks!

20090307155403AASNs4l	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	How does one react to being put on somebody's limited profile on Facebook?!?	So here's the deal. You suddenly realize you haven't heard anything of this guy/girl in months, and they're not someone you normally speak to everyday on Facebook so you only JUST discover that your *** is on limited, when you go on their profile and don't find a wall.      Now we all know it's impossible to limit somebody by mistake.. and we all know the wall is the most important thing on Facebook so taking it away is like a big 'fk you!!!!', so how do you react when someone limits you?

I just recently started using the wireless internet that my uni offers, and connecting to it was fairly complicated (changing proxy settings in browser, etc) but eventually got it working. MSN and both of my internet browsers that I use were working fine.      However, the last couple of days my MSN hasn't been working. When I troubleshoot it, it says that my default gateway is offline.       Anyone know how I can fix this?

Does anyone know which is better? im looking at buying a new computer and i have a geforce 8500 lying around and the computer im looking at has the hd 3200 integrated. the 3200 has 256 dedicated memory, but im not sure how much the 8500 is. it says it is 512mb, but im not sure how much is dedicated. of course, if i buy the 3200 and the geforce ends up being better, i can always put it into one of the expansion slots. so can anyone help me out?       p.s. the only game i play is world of warcraft, so the video requirements aren't super high or anything. thanks
