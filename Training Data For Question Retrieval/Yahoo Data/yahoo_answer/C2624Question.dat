They are both expensive to fix and would like to narrow it down a bit. Please help :)
20070719111551AAcfwh8	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Scuffing other cars in carparks?	Not a habit should be stated, 1st time I've hit anything in 4 years of driving.I found my car blocked in today with what I thought was enough space to get through. I got through the gap but the turn I had to make to get through it resulted in my back side bumper scrapping the side of their car (by the doors). There's a small amount of paint transfer on one side of my back bumper and similiar paint transfer on the other car. I couldn't find the owner at the time but will talk to them first thing in the morning as it's at work (just started this job too - not a good start). I've left the damage to my car as is so they can inspect it if they like. I couldn't see any serious damage to their car but was wondering, a bumper is made of less sturdy material that the side of the car right so it shouldn't of dented/damaged the car badly, visually I couldn't see anything serious. What should i offer to do? Can't say "I'll rub the paint off', is it best to pay for them to go to a garage?

I will put 7 miles a day + some extra millage on week-end.  I like to drive European car.  I use to drive Volvo but want to try BMW.  I found a BMW 325i 2001 at 8800$ Canadian (approx. 7200 US)  It has 80 000 miles on it.  The car was maintained at a BMW dealer and the other owner was pretty meticulous with his car.  I have s 30 pages maintenance folder from the dealer for this car.  Nothing to say, the last owner was a freak.  He gave his 325i back to buy a 2006 X3.      I can do some mechanic myself and can accept some costly repair if need be (if I can't do it myself).  Any advice on my situation?  Are you recommending me to get this BMW or should I lean toward other brands?  Maybe a Volvo S60 T5 manual?      Let me know, help appreciated.      Bruno

20090128221901AAzgQMo	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Will my criminal record disqualify me for my private licence?	I was a rebel growing up, and about five years ago I was charged with shopplifting when my girl friend at the time was caught by Target's security stuffing a 5 dollar neckolace in her purse.  I also was charged with public intoxication my freshman year at college not once, but twice.  In the same week- needless to say, not my best week.  I have no violent crimes nor have I been charged ever with a DUI, which I think the FAA is concerned with more so than the charges i've accumulated, but none the less, I went in for my class 3 and was honest with them, and I have a tense wait to find out what the FAA says to my doctor.  Does anyone know where they drawl the line?  I have straitened up completely, but the FAA does not know this and they do not have a sense of humor. I was also charged with possession of marijuana as a juvi when I was seventeen.  I'm twenty three now. I was nineteen when I made my name on Yahoo as well- fyi.  Anyone that has any information, I would appreciate it.  Thank you!

20090129002712AA4mTN8	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Looking at buying a used car but it has nitrous and a turbo timer hooked up to it and check engine light is on?	I'm looking into buying a 2003 Lancer Evolution with 71,000 miles.  It seems to be in really good condition, with only a few minor cosmetic   quirks.  It has an aftermarket exhaust, aftermarket intake, aftermarket   blow off valve, and some other things.  Upon checking the Dash, I notice the check engine light is on.  Well I go to the lady working and ask her if she knows why.  She informs me that it's probably because there's nitrous hooked up to it, as well as the turbo timer.  Now, I'm kinda freaked out by what she said.  Okay, so I'm telling myself that the car was probably not hurt by the nitrous since it is a high-performance car and I doubt someone would put potentially damaging parts on a $30,000 car without taking the appropriate measures.   I'm getting my step-dad and his friend (both mechanics) to bring their reader to +check it out.  I guess I want to know if anyone knows what a reader would say if the check engine light was on because of nitrous and or a turbo timer.  I'm hoping my step-dad and his friend know, but I also want to know other people's experiences with nitrous and stuff. Also, does anyone know good ways to check and see if the car is ok after being hooked up to nitrous?

20090129013619AA6z0g5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car skips some at certain speeds.?	Hello! I made a trip from Lubbock to Houston (about 600 miles) a few weeks ago. The trip down went very smoothly, but about 400 miles into the trip back I noticed the car was skipping some. I'm having to make the trip again in a few hours because my mom was put into the hospital. Can anyone help me determine if my car is ok to drive?      I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with how a car skips (or hiccups) when you're about to run out of gas but it was a similar feeling. It only did it between 60-65 mph and it would stop if I let up off the gas.       The conditions for this happening were: The winds were blowing EXTREMELY hard, I'm not sure if wind could cause your car to feel like its skipping... Also, I had just put two new tires on my car. The only tires I replaced were the front two, the back two are different tires. Could this cause it to skip? If so, why did it only skip the last 200 miles of the trip?       I haven't noticed any type of skipping at all since I got home, but I also haven't traveled much... I only go like 10-15 miles at a time when I'm home. Also, the oil light kept coming on and off. I'm not sure why though because I just had the oil changed before the trip.      Please help me out... I really need to make this trip but I'm not sure if the car is ok or not. The car is a 1999 Chevy Cavalier. HOWEVER, it has a brand new transmission, radiator, and new head gaskets. It's an older car, but I've replaced just about everything in it over the past 6 months.      Thanks!

20090129020312AAmVxcI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Ford Focus Electrical Failure?	I have just had my third new battery fitted in 6 months, and the 4th in a year, following a complete electrical failure whilst driving in the last incident. The Ford garage in Birmingham did a full electrical diagnostic with each replacement and found nothing wrong except for a "failed battery", which they replaced, under warranty, each time. The last time it happened all the lights on the dashboard flickered for about three seconds and then the engine cut out. The alternater was "steaming out current", but the battery was "as flat as a pancake" according to RAC.  Following the full diagnostics over 3 days, the Ford Technician said that there was no electrics drain on the system at all. Has anyone any idea of what might be wrong? I am disabled and only use the car (01 reg 23K miles) for every other day shopping (4 miles there and back) and occasional long journeys. Ford technician suspected that it was "low mileage problem", but I believe that it may be more fundamental than that, for others, who are disabled and the use their cars in similar modes, do not have this problem. One friend has an 01 Astra, but has only done 5K and he has never had a battery problem.

I have looked into all branches of the military but none of them can guarantee me a flight spot if i join. The Air National Guard seemed promising but their recruiter said the same thing. Does anyone here have experience flying for the armed forces or civilian jobs that would help me build time? A good salary is always good but I am more concerned about building time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

OR what if when you accidentally leave your wallet in your car and your car gets towed and you call a cab to take you to your car and you go in your car to get the money (the person knows he had more than enough money to pay) and the people towing the car had stolen the persons money? what will happen and what can the person do and the cab driver do and what can the person tell the cab driver and or police and what can they do? but what if the person had the wallet in his car because he left it behind by accident. I mean is that also a bad thing to get more money to pay the driver once he drops you off to your house which is your final destionation as you dont have enough on you but more (The moeny to pay him) in your apartment or house?   I mean if the person (or IF I was in this situation) made an attempt to pay the cab driveR?
