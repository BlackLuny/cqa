fvre0o9laa	<a href="http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm</a><br>  <br>  What I want for beginners in sewing:<br>  <br>  - a machine that doesn't scare you<br>  - a machine that isn't balky (cheap new machines are often very<br>    balky or need adjustments often and are rarely repairable --<br>    just too frustrating to learn on!)<br>  - very good straight stitch<br>  - good zigzag (4-5 mm is fine, more than that is gravy)<br>  - a method of making buttonholes that makes sense to you<br>  - adjustable presser foot pressure (which helps some fabric<br>    handling issues)<br>  - accessory presser feet that don't cost an arm and a leg<br>    (machines that use a "short shank foot" typically handle<br>    generic presser feet pretty well.  Some brands of machines use<br>    proprietary or very expensive presser feet)<br>  <br>  If the budget stretches far enough:<br>  <br>  - blindhem and stretch blindhem stitches<br>  - triple zigzag (nice for elastic applications)<br>  - a couple of decorative stitches (you won't use them nearly as<br>    much as you think)<br>  - electronic machine because of the needle position control and<br>    because the stepper motors give you full "punching force" at<br>    slow sewing speeds -- mechanical machines often will stall at<br>    slow speeds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please go to the best sewing machine dealers around and ask them<br>  to show you some machines in your price range, *especially* used<br>  machines you can afford. You'll get a far better machine buying<br>  used than new, and a good dealer is worth their weight in sewing<br>  machine needles when you get a machine problem -- often they can<br>  talk you through the problem over the phone. While you're trying<br>  things out, try a couple of machines (sewing only, not combo<br>  sewing-embroidery) over your price limit, just so you can see<br>  what the difference in stitch quality and ease of use might be.<br>  You may find you want to go for the used Cadillac. Or you might<br>  want the new basic Chevy. Might as well try both out.<br>  <br>  Suggested reading: John Giordano's The Sewing Machine Book<br>  (especially for used machines), Carol Ahles' Fine Machine Sewing<br>  (especially the first and last few chapters) and Gale Grigg<br>  Hazen's Owner's Guide to Sewing Machines, Sergers and Knitting<br>  Machines. All of these are likely to be available at your public<br>  library.<br>  <br>  Used brands I'd particularly look for: Elna, Bernina,<br>  Viking/Husqvarna, Pfaff, Singer (pre 1970), Juki, Toyota<br>  <br>  New "bargain brand" I'd probably pick: Janome (who also does<br>  Kenmore).<br>  <br>  |`|E5gaKzCsaa	In my opinion, any new sewing machine at that price is junk. You'll probably have to buy another one in a few years if you do any amount of sewing. Best value is an older machine from a sewing store, or buy one from someone selling a working older one and have it tuned up. 
83afe7Dvaa	I love my daffodils and I look forward to those a lot-they line the front of my property so it makes a nice show. I have 4 different varieties there.<br>  <br>  I also love Geranium 'Rozanne' which only partially goes dormant in my zone 8 garden.

My favorites are my tulips because I have several different colors; solid  and mixed colors on flowers.|`|5CYn53zSaa	California fuchsia, blue salvia, woolly blue curls, and black-eyed Susans.  My favorite is blue-eyed grass-which actually is not a grass.|`|AA11837404	Aster's...... I LOVE how they add so much beauty to my garden and with so little care.|`|gQorQc3Laa	My Roses.|`|ozBFfvOgaa	It really depends what zone you live in. But I love echinacea  and they are hearty in many zones. They bloom most of the summer and require little care. But they spread a lot so i would not use them if you have a small garden. |`|XnnxWSTcaa	Daffodils come back every year, but they take a long time to spread out, good for clusters.  I noticed my black eyed susans get larger every season.<br>  <br>  |`|ZRk9ptfoaa	I'm in Florida, so it's the Vinca or periwinkle.  It reseeds itself and is very hardy even in dry spells.|`|2wptPP8xaa	Dandilions, But mums are nicer
AA11117067	try hair spray or rubbing alcohol after spot washing the area with some good grease fighting soap like dawn. the hairspray will even take permanent marker out of fabric. just spray on extra liberally and rub in and rinse before the hairspray dries. rubbing alcohol can be used pretty much the same way its just a little weaker. while washing the area with soap use a tooth brush to break up the shoe polish in the fibers of the shirt. just keep scrubbing till the foam of the soap is white again. you can also use the toothbrush to scrub the stain with the hairspray too. it should work wonders.<br>  <br>  hope it helps!!!!<br>  
944iJNAdaa	You're right, this sounds like a clogged septic system.  There could be a clog somewhere between your your last fixture and the tank, though, especially if there's trees nearby.  So, it's a good idea to run a snake down through the line, just to make sure it's not clogged.  You can rent these.  When I was young and had nothing, I remember running a garden hose down through the line, feeling for obstructions :) I'd use a snake now.<br>  <br>  You don't need a plumber to get your septic tank pumped out, at least where I live in Oregon.  You call a septic tank pumping company and they come out and pump it for you.  They all do this the same way, you can buy on price alone.<br>  <br>  Thid is one area you can save money yourself, and that is to dig the dirt up on the top of your septic tank, to expose the lid on top.  Don't remove it (the septic tank guys will do that, plus it stinks), just expose it so they can lift it up.  I haven't had a septic tank pumped for awhile but I'd guess it might be in the $300 - $400 range.  Still, you don't need to add any plumbers bill to that.  Call locally for better price information.<br>  <br>  DON'T add any commercial products, especially at this point.  If you do, you risk flushing septic solids into your drainfield.  Now, THAT'S a more expensive project, perhaps $5000.  Don't do it.|`|AA10720479	My brother had this same exact problem. His septic was completely full, and had to have it pumped. Maybe try rid-ex, but I think it might be too full. Do you have a cap in your yard? If you take this off you can see if it's full or not, but I'm pretty sure it's full. My brother and I did everything we could think of, and nothing worked.|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi<br>  <br>  it may be the outlet pipe to the septic tank be blocked<br>  <br>  open any manhole covers and see where the blockage is<br>  <br>  use drain rods to clear<br>  <br>  get somebody in
5AdVt7dEaa	Before you try anything like that, I would recommend seeing a movie called "Into the Wild" on DVD that just came out.  It was a true story based on the journals of a young man who tried to do the same thing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wi...</a>|`|AA10720479	Good Luck, sounds like a good idea the way everything is going. All you have to do is buy your own land,10 to 15 acres should do(for hunting), and get some building permits, and off you go.
2l8AsMlFaa	You can try Mop-n-Glo for Hardwood Floors, just squeeze some on the<br>  floor, mop up the place where it's slick, and let dry.|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Hairspray|`|dwu1b36xaa	put a towel over it then...|`|XlGjBPBTaa	warm sudsy water should take it off and not harm the finish.<br>  Hardwood floors should be protected with a wax finish but perhaps a runner in the area would give you traction and not distract from the wood appearance of the room.|`|AA11314631	Probably a mixture of Dawn liquid dish detergent and water on a soft cloth will do it. -- After that, clean up with a dry wash-cloth to get rid of the left-over soap residue. <br>  <br>  If you put a rug over it, the rug will just slide too.|`|pd16sn5vaa	Pledge really makes hardwood floor that slipper!?! Um, maybe buy peanuts and throw the shells on the floor.

5ee0276421a3bea7ae0be05f1a356457aa	they'll probably make a counter-offer. make sure the house isn't a short sale - ask your real estate agent to explain how they work... they're not pleasant, and even after months of waiting, you could still lose it in the end if somebody comes in and offers just a bit more. if they're not paying on it, it's possible they're ready to go to short sale.<br>  <br>  don't be afraid to walk away from a house if they're not willing to give you the price you want to pay for it. we just bought our house in January - and before we found this one we made a good offer on a house that was just simply over-priced - and it was over-priced because the family had taken out home equity loans that they couldn't cover... so they couldn't afford to sell it at a reasonable price. it was about to go to short sale because of it. at the time we had a stupid real estate agent who tried to talk us into the bad deal.... so not only did we walk away from the house, but we also fired our agent, found a house we liked better, AND got a better deal on it than we had offered on the first house in the first place.  Rest assured the right house will present itself... i found the whole process to be frustrating and time consuming and totally nerve racking... but in the end  we got our dream home at a GREAT price! if you are in a position to buy in this market - especially a first time home like we did - it's a GREAT market for you! Best of luck! :)|`|jSBtdhf0aa	that sounds like a good price if the house is in good shape. just make sure you get a fixed rate, and be sure your job is recession or depression safe. personally i wouldnt go in debt right now if i didnt have to.|`|a8XxrH64aa	Congratulations you for going to buy a own home!|`|UcWA30y9aa	It sounds to me like you have an excellent chance at it!  They are probably desperate for a buyer and a $9,000 cut shouldn't make them turn your offer down.  Good Luck
2RcIH88Aaa	You may have a burst under ground water pipe, feel the taps if there vibration ring your water supplier.|`|frUYhmuYaa	the reason your house is vibrating is either because it was built over a Indian burial ground OR its that your actually the Antichrist and your basement contains the portal to hell|`|umhjqZwLaa	it sounds like there is air in the lines. this is problematic in older homes. it is best to call a plumber. as a LUMBEE INDIAN from N.C. i really appreciate all of the jokes in the answers.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	it is the ghost of 10 thousand buffalo stampeding by your house every night. probably being chased by the ghost of crazzy horse and his braves.|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	Does it happen at a certain time or when you guys do something specific? Maybe the pipes or vents?
2nGa3N38aa	light the pilot cousin, read the manual, or call your local gas company|`|jSBtdhf0aa	if your stove is new it probably has electronic ignition. push in on the knob you will hear it click real fast . when it lights leave the knob come back out and then adjust the flame where you want it.|`|AA11043457	If you have a gas stove, there is a pilot light that always burns. You do need to make sure the pilot is burning in fact as if it is out then gas goes into the room.  Get a monoxide alarm to put up near the kitchen in case there is a gas leak.  If you had electric stove and furnace, you wouldn't need one but a regualr fire alarm. You need the fire alarm as well as a carbon monoxide detector.<br>  <br>  If the top of the stove raises, raise it and you will see little hole with a flame burning between every 2 burners.  That way when you turn on the knob, it puts gas out and the pilot light catches the gas on fire and that is how you have the flame to cook on.  You probably used an electric stove before.<br>  <br>  it can be dangerous if the pilot light is not on as then gas comes into the room from those pilot holes as gas comes there to burn, a small amount to keep the stove ready to turn on.  Otherwise  you'd have to light it with a match every time.  <br>  <br>  You might want to call the gas company to check it out.  Some stoves might have a special way to light the pilot but the ones I had had a pilot on all the time and it lit the burners. But if the pilot went out, the burner wouldn't light and there would be gas coming into the room.  So if  you are having trouble with it lighting, it could be the pilot light is out.  You better get someone out to help you with it. Often gas companies will come out and help and might not charge. Call and find out. If you have a landlord, call him/her.  If you have a manual, look at it.|`|hK5qzoAVaa	I would not keep it on long.<br>  1. What you should do it turn it off and let it sit (to let gas around the stove to move away)<br>  2. Grab a long lighter if you have one (or just a lighter or matchs)<br>  3. Light the lighter/match<br>  4. Turn the stove to light, or whatever setting you should light the stove on<br>  5. Bring flame to stove A.S.A.P.<br>  <br>  Most new gas stoves have an automatic spark when you put it to "LIGHT" and you can hear a CLICK CLICK CLICK....<br>  Maybe your stove is damaged in some way<br>  If all fails. Turn off stove immediately and read owners manual|`|QPPcUyyyaa	That's a tricky one, because gas stoves you kinda just have to get a feel for.  Every one's a little different.<br>  <br>  I'd try reading the manual first.<br>  <br>  But if you're still having problems, most of them work by turning them all the way to the left, until it stops, and then you should hear clicking.  That click-click-click is the sound of the spark trying to ignite the gas.<br>  <br>  BE CAREFUL.  If the gas doesn't catch fire after five seconds, TURN IT ALL THE WAY OFF AND WAIT AT LEAST A MINUTE for the fumes to dissipate.  The gas will just keep coming out, and the last thing you want is a giant gas ball to ignite in your kitchen.  That . . . would ruin your day|`|dp4hrRkgaa	try pushing the knob while turning it on. that triggers the spark. if it doesnt work, try lighting it up with a match once you've turned it on (make sure you do this quickly).
d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	You can re-laminate an existing counter top successfully.  I do it all the time when refacing kitchens and they not only look new, but they last the same as new at a 1/3 of the cost.  There are places you can cut corners and there's places you don't.  In a kitchen makeover the last thing you want to do is feature a painted counter top.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|l9xnybUMaa	Neither good nor bad, since its just what it is...an idea.<br>  And when you are starting to think about remodeling you should have way more ideas than you need, so you can make the best choices.  I suggest she collect many more ideas in addition to refinishing laminate as a solution to her existing countertops, get the statistics and costs for labor and materials and time, and make an informed decision, a good contractor can help her with this, and if she is planning to sell the house in the next year, she could also consult a realtor .  There isa website for NKBA they are professional kitchen designers.  Lots of ideas are necessary here.  Best of luck good friend.|`|6b5b7e321aec163f317f94d3be808c13aa	Im not sure but if your remodeling you should go with something more upgraded like granite, marble, Tile. Im sure you can refinish it but you can only sand down so much of the laminate beacuse it only has a thin layer of laminate.|`|d581953cf7c9a5c24c566b6ba9022dcdaa	not really ,  if the laminate is worn down it best to ,re install new,<br>   cost around $35 a sq foot.<br>    may i recommend tiles, last longer look better<br>    laminate is out , sorry|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	It can be done and I did it a few years ago when I bought a house that had worn out butcher block laminate.  I contracted a company called NuFinish and they painted it.  It lasted for a number of years and I finally bit the bullet and put in granite just recently.<br>  <br>  The laminates are priced very reasonably, so you might tell your friend to get an estimate on both refinishing and new laminate.|`|AA11043457	If someone is very handy, it can be a do-it yourself job. Most would have it done.  Basically, the laminate is heated to melt the glue and the laminate removed and the counter is sanded well to get rid of any unevenness and the glue.  Then the new laminate is glued down well and sometimes the edges filed a bit.<br>  <br>  It would be cheaper than getting new laminate or granite to have the counter top refinished with laminate.  Your do-it yourself store may be able to advise you and might have a contractor who would do this.  Cabinets can have new doors installed, too and that often gives a new updated look to them as well.<br>  <br>  I would prefer tile or granite to laminate, but it can be re-laminated but they do take off the old, they don't sand it down.
4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	Put them out for recycling if your city offers curbside service.  Otherwise, check the directory for listings of recycling centers and get rid of them that way.

I'm sure some industrial company has something like that. It may be expensive though.<br>  There is this stuff that comes in a packet. Its some sort of powder you add to paint or grout and it makes it mold resistant or "anti mold" as you said it. Just keep the floors clean and use tilex with mold fighting bleach or make your own bottle of diluted bleach. Works wonders!|`|9CtQfAsbaa	im pretty sure that the anti mould for wall tiles is still suitable for floor tiles, just make sure you treat the floor tiles with some waterproof sealent after you have used the anti mould, sorry dont know any brands good luck|`|q2CXlzNJaa	Use epoxy grout for the floor (try Mapei).  Its difficult to install but you will get mold or discoloration on the grout lines.
VY7dlcx7aa	Hmm...if you don't want a jungle theme it should be pretty easy to avoid.  For example, if you wanted to keep a jungle theme, the pictures you would put up would probably be of animals, so you might want to use pictures of people or places that you like instead (abstract pieces are very modern but can be expensive; I'd recommend buying prints or lithographs of modern art from a craft store like Hobby Lobby- cheap and look great framed).  Likewise, light colored or medium-brown wood tends to lend itself to the safari image- you might prefer black or white painted furniture instead.  Silver finishings (such as stainless steel drawer handles and lightswitches) will add to the more modern feel.  Black tends to complement cheetah-prints best, so you might want to use black frames for pictures and lamps with black bases.  The actual wall color is a little trickier- black is extremely modern and edgy, but it also makes a room very dark and can be a little overwhelming.  You might want to stick with a shade of white or tan, but that's all a matter of personal preference.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Lol, my room is VERY much jungle style (three walls bright orange, one wall tiger-stripes, animal pictures on every wall) so I just thought of what I wouldn't do :).  Good luck with your room, I'm sure it'll come out looking really cool! :D<br>  <br>  P.S. If you're into animals and modernism, I remember one of my friend's parents had an awesome statue (or figure, not sure what it really was) of a panther- it was painted a shiny (almost metallic) black and was in a lean stalking pose.  It didn't look at all jungle-y and was sooo cool- if you like big cats you might be able to find a statue like that on eBay or at a furniture store (theirs was on a shelf on one of their bedroom walls).  It was a really nice touch to their room, although as a big cat lover I may be baised ;).

fel6dgh6aa	Highly doubtful. They don't transplant well at all once they're established.  Best bet would be to take stem cuttings.  However, stem cuttings from a bay tree are really slow to root.  They take about 4 to 6 months to grow roots before you can plant them.  Then, they grow slow throughout their lives.  It may take about 20 years for it to reach 15 feet tall.  I work at a propagation nursery and have tried growing bay trees from cuttings there.  The ones I did last year have been planted in pots, but they are still only about 2 inches tall. May be easier to buy a bay tree.

L8zmQS8Jaa	It doesn't sound like you have particularly great place.  Perhaps the rent is very cheap but who can say what you might find if you start looking now.  <br>  <br>  While I read every bit of your long "question," there is not a lot of questioning in it.  You have a problem but are you looking for an answer or a sympathetic ear?  <br>  <br>  You are defeating any potential solution before it is offered.  You are sick of the situation but you can't move.  You don't like the landlord, but you have month's to go on the lease.  <br>  <br>  You can't fix anything without looking at a problem that has solutions. Instead of looking at what you can't do you need to start to look at what you can do.  If you can't afford rent then look for someone who needs someone to house sit.  If you need a more stable environment then look for someone who needs company.  <br>  <br>  Your answers are right in front of you but you will never see them if you don't believe that they are there.   For starters look for something beautiful.|`|K8UKskjfaa	You don't say what city you are located in so it is very difficult to answer your question.  Landlord/tenant laws vary a great deal from one jurisdiction to another.  Generally, however, water leaks are considered a health hazard because they often result in the formation of mould.  Check with your local public health authority and your local tenant advisory board.  You may be able to force your landlord to make the necessary repairs.  Most legislation prohibits landlords from taking any action against you for reporting a potential health hazard.|`|TnT6mLY9aa	you could move|`|3fJ8IMRVaa	In California that Flex tubing is not up to code and would not pass an inspection - you may have an Housing department that you can call and complain to . Its not ok to be a Slum lord , and they do have to repair leaks in a timely mannor . Look in to your state's Renter's rights- offten you can get the book free from your public libary and see how fast he has to jump - and if you have to give him certified writen notice or whatever . <br>  I suggest if you just don't want the headach move ! Find an updated appartment where you will feel safe . If you stay make sure you have renter's insurance just incase your stuff gets ruined from all those leaks.

The problem is not the bleach, which will work outside, but not in the environment you have in the sink, mainly dark, moist and with constant liquids keeping the little critters alive. I assume by now you have discovered the root of their appearance and dealth with that.  <br>  hOWEVER THEY GOT THERE, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE SOURCE. If it was a bad piece of mewat that got stuck in the disposal, etc. make sure that problem is corrected first. Then you go to the home store and get some muriatic acid. Then you get some rubber gloves, just in case. Then you pour some in the drain. If you have two sinks, clog up one side with a towel first. Pour in at a good pace so it will cause them to be flooded down to the U trap under the sink. Give it about 10-20 minutes to destroy the varmints. Then flush a bunch of water through. Then remove the U trap and remove any comatose or dead maggots found there. Put the thing back to gether and you should be good to go.|`|YjD6pArcaa	FIRE, SET THEM ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!|`|qwG8d1yaaa	Umm never happend to me, but I would turn on the disposal and chop them up and pour more chemicals down there.|`|3m7nq3tiaa	if your daring enough get a knife and scrape them off into the drain and use tons of cleaning fluid. try bleach.|`|AMeOjuUpaa	clorox, i try it on my trash can when it has maggots. try spraying it with the water hoe's after.
AA10565336	Compressed air is what I would try first.  If you can back flush the condenser with air it will probably work, water is also an option.  If you have the patience of Job you might make a sort of hook from plastic.  The thin plastic binders sometimes used for magazines could be fashioned into a sort of "slim-jim" type hook.<br>  <br>  To help reduce the problem in the future you could use a nylon stocking on the dryer exhaust.  Another means might be to construct some sort of wall between the exhaust and the AC.  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|jW8nfcA6aa	Shut off the Power to the AC,remove the guards and vacuum the surface gently ( the fins are very fragile and bend over easily ). If you can remove the top and fan, then you could spray cleaner and garden hose back flush.Any stubborn lint could be dislodged by the whisking action of a brush.Do not use a powerful pressure washer this may flatten many fins quickly.

The Fridge needs air for cooling. The base shelf should be 4" up then other shelves depending on your storage needs. The back,base,top,and shelves should be 3/4" material. The Fridge side could be regular plywood and the exposed side you would see could be veneer,stained,covered in laminate,tiles,etc. Trim the front edges thin strips of wood or self-stick veneering. I would leave approx. 1" of space between the Fridge and project. Optional to install hinged doors.

Paint stalactites by the door make them resemble fangs however. You could paper mache some to hang from the ceilingng and place some stalagmites on the floor. Perhaps use them as bed post or coat/hat tree. You can get real neat rubber bats (sold as Halloweenween decorations) and suspend them so they are flying or hanging around.

QRtUdvfXaa	I am a General Manager for a Manufactured Home Retail lot.  Speaking with my experience in the industry.  I hope this will help you out.  If the home is already a pre-existing home on the property, then it will be a little more expensive then if the home is new and being placed on the property now.  It is always cheaper and easier to do something for the first time, then having to go back and dig everything out and take everything out and start over.  So, I am going on the house is new and just being placed on the property and you have to run all of your Utilities.  I am going to give you average cost of what I have ran into in the past.  If there is no rock when you are digging the water line trench to the road...running your water can run you any where from $3-$5 a foot.  So if the Tap is 100 foot away from the house you could look at any where from $300 to $500 to run your water lines.  That's if you don't hit any rock and they don't have to blast the rock out to get the lines ran.  Running your Sewer lines to the road will cost you $7 to $10 a foot.  Again, if you a 100 foot it could run $700 to 1,000.  Which is a little cheaper then installing a septic tank.  Also, you will need to check with your local county or city to see if you have any type of permits that you have to get before anything can be done to the property.  As far as your Electric..Again, I don't know where you are at, but our Electric company here, you have to go an apply for an Electric Permit.  Then they will send a Engineer out and see if there is a power pole close enough for you to pull off of.  If there is not, they will have to set a pole.  Which the Electric Company will not charge you for the first pole, but the 2nd pole will cost you $150.  So you will have to check with the electric company to see what to do before you start.  Then you will need to get a licensed Electrician to hook your electric to the house.  If you can go overhead electric it should cost anywhere from $800 to $1900.  If you have to go all underground service it will run you any where from $1800 to $2500 depending on the distance it is from the pole.  That is just the basic utilities that you need.  The other things that you might want to consider is...Porches/Decks, Foundation/Skirting, Gutters and Driveway.  Unless these things are included with the house & land already.  Hope this helps, It is hard to give you the pin point price, but the best advice I will give you is cheaper is not always better, when you are getting prices from local contractors.  I learned that the hard way.  You want someone that will do it and do the job right and is reliable even if they are a little higher then the other ones.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	depending on how far you have to run your lines i would guess between 3 and 4 thousand bucks. it aint cheap.|`|YY24gmRpaa	This is not a question that can be answered with the info you have provided.  First, the cost will be different in different areas and will depend on how long the run is for utility lines and if any new poles have to be used or if it is run underground.  Tapping into sewer. how long is the run and what depth and is the street paved or not, etc.  <br>  You will have to talk to local contractors for the info you want.

v3xEtuLLaa	You won't find a piece of solid wood that wide unless it's edge-glued.  You can make your own by getting 2-18" x 48" pieces and gluing them up.  You will need to clamp them, and if you have access to a biscuit joiner that will make the joint even stronger.  Glue both edges, glue the slots if using biscuits, press the edges together, and clamp them.  Use one every 12", alternating top and bottom.  Wipe off excess glue right away, and let sit overnight.  When you remove the clamps, you will have your slab.  The joint will be stronger than the wood itself.  If you don't have a way to do this, check a woodworking supply shop.  They may be able to make one for you.  Hope this helps.|`|umhjqZwLaa	call the nearest sawmill. they can make any size you need.|`|d581953cf7c9a5c24c566b6ba9022dcdaa	look at a second hand store for a n old kitchen table. . that would be your best idea|`|fNuMoHt7aa	If you can't find it at your local hardware store then glue 2 pieces together.<br>  I don't know what else to tell you

AA12116854	Bleaching is the only thing I can think of that would totally take the mold/mildew out. I'd start the water filling in the washing machine then put about 1/6 of a cup of bleach in and let it fill up and dilute before putting the shirt in.<br>  Or, you could try using Pine Sol or White Vinegar (safest I think) and do the same thing in the machine. I'd try these latter two first then use the bleach as a last resort.

MCvC6SwQaa	One,,, is it really mold?  Could it be dirt or dust?  <br>  <br>  Two,,, mold comes from moisture.  Moisture on your A-frame in your unit can cause mold, if the air flow is very low, or the unit never dries out.  However, if this is the source of the mold, you will have several ducts / vent with mold.  Those closet to the air handler, or main trunk will be the worst.  Solution is to clean the A-frame, of dirt and such, and then treat with a mild bleach solution.  If you are not comfortable doing this, a standard HVAC contractor can do this for you.  You do not want to damage the coil, or the little fins on the coil.<br>  <br>  Problem is,,, if the A-frame is the source, your duct work could also be contaminated with mold.  <br>  <br>  Now, I'm not saying it's the case,,,, but,,,, if you are blowing cold air out of the vent, in a humid environment, the moisture may be ON THE CEILING,,, from condensation.  Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  Also,,, if you are just wiping the mold, you are not killing the mold, and it will grow back all by itself, as long as it has moisture.  Wipe the area down with a 10% bleach solution, them see what happens.  <br>  <br>  Toxic mold is a bad thing,,, but there is far too much hesteria about it these days.  I don't remember 1000's of people falling over dead in the 70's, or the 60's from their air conditioners.  <br>  <br>  You have to treat it,,, all of it,,, but don't have a cow.  It's just a thing.|`|5rsN7VsUaa	Is the humidity causing the mold growth coming from the AC unit itself? You need to find the water/humidity source.

omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  <br>  I think "muddled basil" (# 7745) might be a good choice.<br>  <br>  You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.roomvues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roomvues.com/</a><br>  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Lets see if I get the picture its a small room with standard ceiling height, only one window, and there is molding somewhere in the room, either trim molding or crown molding, Im guessing trim molding baseboards, doorand window frames...? Wall to wall carpet in a dark blue, and you want ideas for wall colors to create a sleek modern looking room. Your preference for modern furniture is great for making the most of small spaces but you will have to work at it  a little, it will take more than paint to pull it off.  So here goes:  With a very dark floor in a small room you will have a closed in denlike feel, if possible add one of those scandanavian sheepskin white rugs to lighten the floor area, try ikea.com, then i recommend wallpapering the entire room in a chic linenand grasscloth textured wallpaper. keep the ceiling white and the trim too, but use a shade of wallpaper that sets off the rug color and is still as light as possible, use chrome or white porecelain lamps to pull the color from the rug into the room, and use texture in all your choices, such as black and white silk bedding, pleated roman shades for the windows, and bring in a small mirror and a plant with a small black chest of drawers, add inspired artwork to express your mood for the room, and its heaven!  I know I get carrried away with this stuff!

AA10045620	Try searching resale stores like the Salvation Army.  Purchase a good new mattress though.|`|q1GpAqZnaa	well i am a 16 too, and i know the feeling. I need a new futon, but noooo. lol<br>  Anyways, go on to something like criagslist.com, and once you are on there search for where you will be, or something of the such. Just wherever you are going to be able to pick it up from. It is a community selling, where people sell the things they do not want anymore. I have bought many things from this website, and a lot of the stuff is great. But other than this, you could search for Clarence in all kinds of different furniture stores. A lot of the stuff is less than 700, but with a 500 dollar budget, it is some tight money. I say just buy a nice bed, with a really good mattress, and some somewhat good looking dressers and drawers.
jcauTPLZaa	Check the ends of your bulb. If they are black change them, if not its your ballast. That's easy to change out. Yes the bulbs do have mercury in them, and florine gas as well. As long as you don't break it and rub it all over yourself your fine, there isn't enough in it to worry about it.|`|bbf5ba03e8f1091ed1d55be1570e5916aa	Try turning the tube in the socket. Sometimes it's just a bad connection. If the condition continues replace the tube with a new one.  There is no mercury in a fluorescent tube.
8IRmQDrAaa	There's a big difference between the steam cleaners you see at places like Wal-Mart and those which will actually give you the results you're looking for. Look for one that has a stainless steel boiler (to prevent rust), and one that has a boiler temperature of at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit and offers 50 PSI or more. That will give you a very effective steam that can kill bacteria, mold, smells, etc. There's a lot of them out there, one of the better ones is at the link I provided. I have the $299 yellow model and it really works A LOT better than a cheap one I got at Target. Hope that helps!|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	Get the steam cleaner, you won't regret it.  Having it on hand will enable you to keep your rugs and furniture looking good.  Steam is also a great sanitizer.  You'll find a lot of other uses for it around the house.  I use my steam cleaner every day in my kitchen.  It's great for cleaning those glass shelves in the fridge.  I don't even remove the food!  Just move everything to one side, steam and wipe.  You can't beat it for tile or laminate flooring.  And there's no need to buy chemical cleaners that can leave streaks and residue.  I'm hooked on the power of steam, you will be too if you get your own.<br>  <br>  I have a Scunci hand-held steamer and the H2O mop.  There's no  need to buy 2 appliances though.  Most of the steam mops have attachments for portability.
Gzk1TQFAaa	I too had a motor home with that awful paneling.  Here's what I did:  First fill the cracks with Spackle (it's available at Lowe's and Home Depot, cheap) then sand any excess spackle so you have a smooth finish.  A sanding sponge works great for this.  Next you paint any color you want.  I was thrilled with the results.  No more ugly paneling.  There's no need to prime and the result looks just like painted drywall.  And, of course, it seems much bigger!|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Clean the paneling well with TSP. Tape and prime with  water-based Kilz-it tinted to your paint color. Paint with eggshell finish paint.<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  Go here and type in orange for the color and find the closest one to your baskets and it will show you 2 coordinating colors to use.|`|AA11043457	Be sure to use a sealer or primer first before painting and then paint it with semi gloss in a light color. Could do cream color and your burnt orange and rattan will still look good.  Could do in white, too, but that won't mesh with the brown and orange as well as the cream will do.  Sort of light color but just a bit yellowish looking (not too yellow, but well, cream is all i can call it or maybe ivory it could be called.   Definitely need the primer though to make the paint adhere well and semi gloss will look like the beadboard.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Wow 1987 is a classic!  I know making it seem bigger is important but when a space is this small there is only so much you can do with paint. You might want to touch up light fixtures in a metal or color spraypaint, also replace or repaint cabinet hardware and doorknobs which can be painted out or painted accent red to set off a color scheme.<br>  So I suggest painting an  eggshell or semigloss finish, try both and see which plays best in your space, paint the ceiling to match and any and all trim, then try subtle color areas like pale greyblue on one wall that has a door, and paint everything else in an offwhite that works with the carpet flooring and window coverings, which you should consider changing if they are original to 87!  Curtains in a retro print with an offwhite background...Tuuubular!|`|d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	I have two, the motorcoach I just bought, and the one I had for years that I'm now selling - 1988 Winnebago Superchief, so I know what you're looking at and wanting to do.<br>  <br>  Here's what I did and it looks like a new RV.<br>  <br>  Go into your local hardware, ACE is where I found it, and purchase the spray cans of Krylon stone finish.  There's several different colors, I chose two; Granite for the salon and bedroom and a Rose Granite for the bathroom.  Clean the walls with SuperClean which is the best dirt, grime and grease remover on the market (find it in Wal-Marts Automotive Section); mask everything off to prevent overspray, and start spraying. This stuff lays on nice, looks like and is tgough as stone when it drys.  I have three big dogs and a raccoon that travel and lives with me so believe me it's durable and cleans well.  I also ripped up that carpeting and laid Pergo in the salon and tile in the bathroom using a 1/4" backer underlayment that's held up really well.  Pull all those window frames and repaint them using a spray can of epoxy in the color you thinks will work best; mine are black as it accents the stone finish on the walls.<br>  <br>  Other great tips that aren't expensive. . . go to your local home center with measurments for verticle blinds to get rid of those curtains and really update the aesthetics of that interior; and FRP the walls of the shower.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>

yyf5N7Ogaa	I have had pretty good luck with Rat Zapper. It uses a battery and is the least "hands on" method. The other traps can get pretty messy. <br>  <br>  If the whole building has mice, they won't stay out of just your apartment. You might talk to your landlord and your neighbors and see about getting an exterminator. If the landlord doesn't want to do anything, I'd call the health department and see if your city has any regulations.|`|vvB0Etysaa	I never had that problem and if I did I would be afraid to sleep there.<br>  The only way is buy a free traps and hard cheese to the trap.<br>  <br>  Check and see where they are coming from.

Always place poison along the wall as they always instinctively follow walls, never cut across the room. The poison will cause them to dry up and not rot and smell. If it's a building wide problem the management should be dealing with the issue. If you do the sticky trap route then you have to deal with the stuck live mice. Put all traps along the parameter of the room, behind fridge, stove etc against the wall. Keep all dry goods in sealed containers and clean up all crumbs etc daily.
nrdSl8cBaa	I like the materials list of the first answer, generally you will need about 1- 2"x4"x8' stud per running foot.  In your case, having a few extra to use as wall braces while you nail the wall in place is a must.<br>  <br>  Lay  2x4s side by side running the length of the floor and cut the last to fit, leaving them at about 1/4" short.  Begin from 1 wall and mark a line every 16 inches on each board to the next wall using a 'speed square. **Remember which wall you measured from to know how to mark your nail centers for drywall (DIYers often find it helpful to mark stud center lines on their sheetrock prior to hanging it)**  One row will become the bottom sill plate and the other the top rail.  Measure the height of the wall in several places and note the change with a drawing.  Cut the studs to be about 1/8th" short and nail them CENTERED on your lines except don't nail the outside studs to the sill plate until the wall is raised.  (This helps you accommodate adjacent walls not being perfectly plumb.)  Your wall will have two sill and cap joints.  Nail these studs after the wall sections have been secured in place. Use a plumb bob suspended from the ceiling or a level to assure your wall is perfectly plumb (vertical). You will appreciate having done so later when you hang the doors. You will find that using wood shims to wedge the wall in position helps you nail them.  Nail/ screw through the shims<br>  <br>  If your floor is concrete, you may choose to nail the sill plates with either a powder-actuated nail gun, concrete nails, or even drill holes through the wood into the concrete using a masonry bit in a hammer drill, place an expanding bolt anchor anchor, and secure with a bolt and washer.  The nail gun is by far the easiest and they're cheap to rent.  Use a 'pin' each 3 feet if you choose the gun.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you've already chosen door openings.  Ideally, you may place them against a stud.  Otherwise, leave an opening about 4" wider than your door opening.  Cut 2 pieces of 2x8 the length of this opening<br>  and nail them at least 79" from their bottom edge to the floor, parallel to <br>  each other so that their faces are flush with the edges of the studs.  Then use a saw to cut away the sill plate at the stud of the opening and cut two 'cripple studs the length of the rough door opening.  Nail them flush to the studs at the side of the door opening and touching the 2x8s.  Spending a little extra time here with a level or plumb-bob and some wooden wedges to make sure these studs and header are perfectly vertical and level is time well-spent for when you're ready to hang the pre-hung door and frame.  Otherwise, you will need lots more wooden shims and blocks to position the door perfectly plumb when you nail it into place after you have hung your drywall.  <br>  <br>  If you use drywall screws, use a screw gun with adjustable chuck so you don't penetrate the drywall paper around the screw heads.  Plan on a fastener every 10-12 inches along the studs. Otherwise, just use drywall nails and plan on floating the hammer depressions.  You will need one roll of drywall tape, a mud tray, and 4", 8" and 12" putty knives to apply the drywall compound.  You will need at least one drywall sanding poll, pad and a small box of sanding screens.  Here is another place for taking some extra time to float first with the 4" knife, allow to dry, then sand, and repeat with 8", and 12" knives will leave you the best results.|`|EKbsCexbaa	Hire a contractor and support the ailing economy.|`|d581953cf7c9a5c24c566b6ba9022dcdaa	one 2x4 for each foot , 2 12ft   2x4 for the base, 2 for the the header.<br>  25 2x4 for the frame, nails, around 6lb<br>   sheet rock, comes in 4ftx8ft. plus two buckets of mud<br>   and three boxes of dry wall screws<br>    two doors, nice ones ok ...lol<br>    and one hardworking buddy ...

SAlxxqpmaa	What I've seen in the past is something could be blocking the water from coming out of the water heater at the connection on the top. You should have a ball valve on the hot and cold pipes going into the water heater. If there is just one on the cold side that's ok too. Shut the valve(s) on top of the water heater off. Let some of the pressure out through the drain valve at the bottom. It should have what looks like hose thread adapter and a handle or screwdriver head. Disconnect  the pipe on the hot side (left side) where it connects to the water heater at the top. Hopefully it is a flexible copper pipe or there is a union fitting you can take apart. look inside where the two connected and see if there are any mineral deposits building up around these area. This blockage can be removed using a wire fitting brush or a screwdriver and a hammer. This stuff can be as hard as concrete come times and might take some work getting it all cleared out. I hope that is it because that would be the cheap and easy fix.<br>  Good luck, You can do it|`|d581953cf7c9a5c24c566b6ba9022dcdaa	you mite have , a bad heater, blown fuse, no gas, broken  hot water pipe.<br>     check back from the tank, then work toward the hot water pipes|`|zTcpZEm7aa	First thing to check is to see if the gate or ball valve on the inlet to the water heater hasn't been inadvertently partially closed.

K8UKskjfaa	Trace the outline you want onto a  4' x 8' sheet of 3/4" plywood.<br>  <br>  Cut out the shape with a jig saw.<br>  <br>  Build a frame with 2 x 4s to support the platform off the floor to whatever height you wish.  You don't need to frame it right out to the edges because the 3/4" plywood can stick out as much as 8" beyond the frame.<br>  <br>  Buy high density 4" foam and glue it on to your platform to hold it in place while you cut.<br>  <br>  Use an electric carving knife to cut the foam to fit the outline of your platform.<br>  <br>  Buy some sturdy material from a fabric store to cover your mattress (stuff called "ticking" will work pretty well).

That is not going to be an easy one to acomplish.  Might be easier to just hang black lace or net curtains around a regular bed to use plenty of black in the room.

Cold air from outside is heavier than the warm air inside your apartment.   The cold air will enter the open window and immediately fall down onto the water pipe inside the heat radiator.<br>  <br>  If you're really roasting, leave the window open but turn on a fan that will direct warm air from inside the apartment toward the wall beneath the window.  This will redirect the cold air and prevent it from freezing up the system.<br>  <br>  As a desperate last resort you might try using corregated (2 layer) cardboard to make a device to direct the cold outside air from the window further out into the room so that it will mix with the warm inside air rather than falling directly onto the radiator.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	umm yaahh ... <br>  crack is bad...<br>  <br>  put a jacket over your radiator it will keep it warm
L8zmQS8Jaa	Goodness, those stops under the sink do sometimes get stuck that way.  If there is any valve stem left you can carefully try to losten the "nut" (packing nut) below it slightly and turn it with the plyers as previously recommended.  Be advised that if the packing nut was at some time cross threaded it may fly off and then you will have a very serious problem as water will now be flooding the bathroom instead of going down a drain.  If you don't have access to another turn off valve and don't know what a cross threaded nut feels like maybe you should leave it alone.  (By the way, losening the packing nut is how you should have tried to turn the valve in the first place.)<br>  <br>  Do you have access to a main turn off valve.  Most often they are located where the water comes into a building around the wall to the outside somewhere.  If it is a round handle it is probably a gate valve and I would leave it alone as old ones have a tendency to jam as well and your plumbing luck has not been too good.  If it is a lever that is in line with the pipe it is a ball valve and you can turn it 1/4 turn usually clockwise and it will turn off the water.  <br>  <br>  If you don't have access to any other turn off valve and don't want to risk the packing nut it might be time to take a look at the situation in a different light.  What is the problem.  If the sink is filling up too fast for the overflow and drain to drain it then you will have to call someone to come in immediately and see if there is some way to direct the water to the tub as well.  If the drain of the sink is handling the flow, you have a wasted water situation and that is all.  There is little emergency only a waste and no damage.  Leave it until the morning.  AT THAT TIME the plumber will have to have access to turn off the MAIN water.  You might have to start that proceedure now.  <br>  <br>  EDIT:   The valve you show in the picture is a washerless valve stem from the top of the sink.  It should only go 1/4 turn in one direction or the other.  I assume you have tried both directions.   It may be that there is a spring or piece of rubber stuck under the valve and jamming it.  Show a current picture of the piece under the sink for an appraisal of your chances to turn that off.  It doesn't look too bad in the "before" picture.  Then what tools do you have?  Do you have a pair of channel locks or vice grips as well as an 8" or larger adjustable wrench?  How about a zip tie or a piece of string?<br>  <br>  One easy solution would be to carefully pull the hose back on itself (pinch it making sure that it still comes out of the lower valve straight without any added strain) and tie it or clamp it with the vise grip.  The hose may well be ruined but you should be able to stop most if not all of the water.  (Although with your luck you might still be better off just letting it run.)

fNuMoHt7aa	Who waters trees? especially mature ones?????<br>  <br>  -$2000 the cost to take it down pine trees get uglier as they get older|`|YY24gmRpaa	A seventy foot pine tree does not need surface watering.  It's roots go down and out about the same distance as it is tall.  Talk to a professional landscaper or a professional tree guy.  The actual value is only in the wood it would produce if you cut it down and take it to a sawmill and then one tree ---maybe 40 or 50 bucks.  You will have a very hard time proving that the renters killed it.|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	What sort of pine tree was it? Some varieties are worth more than others considering how rare or endangered they may be.Was it part of the renters agreement to water the tree? If so, you could probably get the cost of a new tree out of them but first you have to determine, by species of the dead tree, what it wa worth. If you have pictures of the tree in happier days maybe you could take it to your local gardening center to see what variety it is and how much a new one, plus the cost of installation of another tree would be.<br>  <br>  And OF COURSE you water trees, particularly in a state like California where there may be droughts.<br>  <br>  And I disagree with the other Answers responder: a big healthy pine tree is glorious to behold.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	Every good real estate guy I've ever known has given me the same advise about trees. Other than the appeal it might have for a potential buyer it has no intrinsic value as far as the property goes and will never be figured into the price other than as a matter of landscaping. Lack of water probably did not kill a pine tree. Pines are very hearty trees and a lack of water will stunt its growth and give other problems, but will rarely kill the tree by itself. My guess is that the roots got damaged. also if it is anywhere close to the water then salt air will also kill it. Most pines are inland trees and do not tolerate living near the ocean but if it was 70 feet then it was more than likely well established. If it is close to a road, check to see if any road work was done recently. Tracked equipment can crush the roots near the surface. Equipment on tires will rarely do this but it is still possible.

If you have many items of the same color redying them all together may be an option. Do not wash it to hot and try a shorter washing program.

nrdSl8cBaa	I've built lots of KD furniture that used 1/4 inch hardwood dowels on 3/8th melamine or 3/8ths hardwood dowels for 3/4. But drilling the holes in melamine without a drill press and clamp-jig sure would be difficult to align the holes properly<br>  <br>  I would run another 1x2 ledger under the return of the other shelf, screwing/nailing it to the other ledger. It's best if one ledger on the shelve's leading edge goes to contact both walls. Then before placing those shelves down, I'd apply a thick bead of wood glue or a bead of panel adhesive and clamp them till tacked.  I think you'll find that the glue holds everything flush and imparts substantial strength to the shelves' load capacity, while also protecting them from warping.  A few finish nails gives the glue extra shearing resistance for a bit more strength still.  This works if you're using one-sided melamine finish, otherwise the slick melamine prevents strong glue bond with the ledgers unless you use something like a neoprene panel adhesive.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You are going to need a post in the corner. <br>  I did that same thing with 3/4 plywood with no seams ,faced with 1x2 and it is just strong enough.

Do you bright and cheery-soothing, maybe some greens. Accent with the green and blues in darker colors. Or maybe something very classic like browns, you can find so many things in these colors now and it looks very nice. If you add the pewter accents it's almost like a spa. Please do not put a wallpaper in a bath-too many problems if not done correctly or little ventilation. Good luck|`|l9xnybUMaa	Why dont you ttry a wallpaper.  Blue walls may be too dark for such a small room.  Or just paint the room white, and then bring in artwork, accessories, and beautiful towels for color. Hope this helps.|`|AA11554181	Blue sounds like a dull color for such a small bathroom.|`|AA11043457	I'd go with a design or something to decorate it and leave it mild but open to accents.  With those colors I am thinking nautical, but don't now where you live or what is appropriate.  I have brown and sage green on my cream walls with white accents and palm trees - on my shower curtain and my window and in the border which I put  just about waist high rather than at the top of the room.  I live in Florida near the beach.  I could as easily have done sea shells and I do have some shell things there as well.  So what  do you like? By putting in seashells, it can be more feminine.  By using sailing ships it can be more masculine but it is light enough to also be feminine.  Those little Sandpiper birds would be cute and still in a nautical or beach scene. However, if you are in a desert you might want to think of something more suited to  your environment so your home reflects the surroundings and celebrates the part of the country where you are.<br>  <br>  i have a little cottage in Arkansas and I put rainbow trout cabinet knobs on all the cabinets and painted the cabinets in colors that reflected the trout, like lime green doors and backing on bottom of the shrimp or peachy orange color and the top having some ivory for the babinet backs.  Then I have some red at the very top that was there before and I left it.  I used semi gloss light yellow for the rest of the dining area and living room.  Those colors sound a bit strange but they are the colors of rainbow trout and they look good together.  Making a little place look alive and perked it up.  You have already selected colors there and unless you changed it to reflect your surroundings you need to decorate using those colors.  So perhaps think about what you like and what kind of accents you want to use.  I can sort of picture it with ships - sailing boats.  But what  do you really like?  I like candles in a bathroom as well, when possible.  Just don't forget they are ther and make sure they are safe if you burn them.

l9xnybUMaa	Well my friend, good news and bad news, good news is it appears you saved your tags, bad news is you are dealing with an industry that is like fashion styles change fabric patterns are discontinued and nothing is permanent anymore.  Even if you could identify it you may not be able to get the exact fabric anymore, and the GOOD NEWS is that matching matching is not fashionable anyway, try a white leather upholstered ottoman with a similar leg style and finish as your chair, go for coordinating it instead of matching, just be sure the seat height is  the same or lower than the chairs seat height and width is the same or smaller.  Match as many details as you can, welts, nailhead trim, skirting, wood finish shade.  If you cant get help from the store, try emailing an ethan allen designer with a photo and have them design an ottoman for you!.  I hope this helps you get a great result!

AA11043457	Yellow goes very well with browns.  The black doesn't go as well with browns but is usually thought of as grey or whites with black or reds.<br>  <br>  I think  your faint yellow may be an ivory which is a light neutral color and would go better with the brown while white walls would go better with black.  if you haven't bought that Black stand yet, I might pass on it and get  a wood tone cabinet or stand.  However, TV's are often black anymore and if it is, you need to go with a stand of similar color or lighter color.  There is going to be a bit of clash with black and brown, but I don't think it will make a big difference.  It would be better to keep the tan color rather than black if possible.|`|WTy8I1Nvaa	I think you need to explore some other home decoration ideas,<br>  <br>  Visit <a href="http://www.gharexpert.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gharexpert.com</a> and enjoy thousands of ideas,tips, articles ,home decor pictures and more.

XayiqDyUaa	The Legal Standard for Repairs: Warranty of Habitability<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Landlords have the responsibility to maintain residential rental property and repair any defects. Under most state law, there is an implied warranty of habitability, which is defined as the minimum standard for decent, safe, sanitary housing suitable for human habitation. This warranty applies throughout the lease. Most jurisdictions that ordinances or laws that require owners of real property to maintain the property and make any necessary repairs. These codes typically require that any rental property offered by a landlord must meet the minimum standards established in the codes. The landlord's obligation is to deliver the rental property to the tenant in compliance with the housing codes and to maintain compliance with the housing codes throughout the time the tenant has possession of the rental property.<br>  <br>  Check out this website for tenant rights.|`|bCcQBG23aa	I cant tell you anything from a legal view but from what I know and what would make sense is yes your landlord must fix this.<br>  Landlords are usually responsible for any wear and or tear. Unless you did something to cause the garage to leak then the landlord is responsible. My advice would be to take pics of things and have dates recorded down. Call the landlord and let him know whats going on and that you want something done about it asap. <br>  If you need to look in your local phone book for numbers on legal advice, housing advice, rental advice, etc, There should be many numbers or resources that will help you out on advice for free.|`|nHjYVx7Laa	Yes your landlord should fix it.

nrdSl8cBaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Where I live, the houses mostly use drywall, but often the vents are attached with delicate sheet metal screws to the lip of a metal vent pipe terminus.  If that sheet metal holding the screw is stripped, we have the same problem. Sometimes just using a slightly thicker screw or more coarsely-threaded screw will hold the vent cover.  When that fails, I'll offer a simple solution and a harder one.  Both should begin with you cleaning the vent cover.<br>  <br>  The easiest might be to simply lightly wedge the vent tight to the ceiling with an 8' long 1"x2" board and 'T' board, then caulk the seam around it with a thin bead of a quality silicone caulk. With a plaster surface, you will want to wipe the joint area clean with a damp cloth first. If you don't caulk well, use a quality 3M masking tape (removes easily without marring the surface) on on the ceiling near the vent, leaving about 1/8th of an inch uncovered near the vent cover.  Then you can wipe the bead with a finger moistened in water with a bit of dish-washing liquid soap in it (to make your finger slippery), and just peel the tape (now with silicone smears) off to leave a neat bead. You will want to avoid wide thin silicone smears on the plaster because paint will not adhere to most silicone caulks, although GE makes a paint-able silicone caulking which is available in ivory, aluminum gray, and brilliant white to match vent cover colors.   After a few hours, you can remove the boards and, should you ever need to remove the vent, you may just cut the silicone bead with a utility knife.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, a better mechanical solution would be to use a pencil to mark the edge of the vent, then remove it and glue a strip of hardwood shim against the plaster with a bit of panel adhesive, being careful to remain inside the pencil mark. If you have a bit of thin sheet metal you can also glue under the wood, so much the better.  After the glue has a day to dry, hold the vent cover over strip flush to the ceiling and use a pencil in the screw hole to mark your wood strip.  Then drill a pilot hole slightly smaller than the screw's diameter in your wooden strip, replace the vent cover, and carefully screw into you wood strip. If you also used sheet metal, you will have a very strong connection, otherwise you will need to take care not to strip your wood strip and have to use a wider screw.|`|evItC2KQaa	The vent attaches to the duct work. There should be a flange on the duct where the register attaches.You probably need a longer larger diameter screw to secure it.
