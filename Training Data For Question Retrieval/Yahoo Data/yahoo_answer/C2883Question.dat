20090202210210AAeUIvN	Environment;Global Warming	Why do the "sceptics" never cite their sources? ?	Why won't they do it? Is it because they get all their info from some secret secret location, and they've all been told that the enemy must not know about about it under any circumstances? Or do they not want it revealed that everything they say is regurgitated from newsmax.com, or some equally ridiculous source?

20090202210700AA5WEsM	Environment;Conservation	What solution is there to "Illegal Tree Loggers" and "Illegal Gold Miners"?	What should be done to stop them? Is there any hope? What do you guys think of our rain forests? Do you care if they disappear?      Rain forests absorb most of the carbon dioxide,  unfortunately, with the illegal tree loggers, and illegal gold miners, they are destroying the rainforests, that will eventually make them something that will be told to our children in stories, if nothing is done.....      What do you guys think the U.S., and other countries Should do? Do you think it's worth it to save the rain forests? I do, but unfortunately, those living in them have no mercy.

20090202211126AAl4wK5	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Why are hybrid cars and other compact cars so UGLY?	Why can't they make a hybrid/environmentally friendly car that looks cool? I understand that weight is an issue, but with newer technology they should be able to put a hybrid engine on a lighter, better looking body and a longer frame.      I just think the Priuses and Yarises are the fugliest cars ever built. I would consider buying one if it didn't look like an escape pod from the Starship Enterprise.      Why can't they put a hybrid engine in, say, a Mustang body or a Charger body?      What's the idea behind the design of hybrid vehicles?

20090202205706AAeAZ0S	Environment;Green Living	How can I get my friends to stop using styrofoam?	At my school, they use styrofoam trays to serve food. When the kids are done eating, they just throw out the trays. Being an eco-maniac, this bugs me a little bit. I've asked all of my friends to stop using the styrofoam trays, hoping to start a trend. However, they won't and actually started using more trays to make me angry. I, myself have also stopped using the trays whenever I buy my lunch. If setting an example won't work, then what will?
