20090223074014AAg5mwr	Health;Other - Health	I thought I was suppose to feel better?	This year was going to be the year I sorted out my health. I was going to remove majority of processed foods, and focus on cooking from scratch. Since Thursday I'm been eating right. Lots of salads, with spinach, and carrots and so on. Well, since I've started, I've been severely gassy, horrible stomach pains, and horrible breath. It's just not right. I thought when you ate health, you were suppose to have good breathe and feel good. Well, I feel awful. I called in work sick cause I was puking and had severe stomach pains. I was lying down with the heat pad all day.      Why is this?         ?¤·??¤·??¤·?      Suggest topics were pregnancy....I can say right now I shouldn't be pregnant. I got AF Tuesday, just finished yesterday.

My main goal is to lose atleast 2 stones(28 pounds) by May.This is because i turn 17 on May and am planning to wear a really nice dress which wont fit unless i lose my flabs!!(lol)   Anyway,  i use the cross trainer for an hour everyday, and casual walking (about half a mile) to and from school everyday.   My diet is pretty healthy, containg lots of fruit/veg/protein/fibre.   I try to consume around 800-100 calories a day. Sometimes i do tend to have a lil' chocolate, but when i do, i count the calories and burn them off straight away.For instance, yesterday, i had a choclate which had 113 calories and ended up burning it off.   What i want to know is, is my diet good enough to lose atleast 5 pounds in a week? If not, can someone advise me on how i can improve my diet?   thanks!!x

20090223075807AAjBrsS	Health;Mental Health	Do I have an eating disorder or body dysmorphic disorder?	I was very overweight as a child and I was always treated differently by my peers and my family. I started to really hate myself around the end of middle school though and basically stopped eating. Then when I began to eat a little, I became bulimic. And then, when I stopped myself from purging, I became excessive with working out. After school I would go to the gym for 2 and a half hours. This took place all through highschool and college, and now I'm 22. Today I hate myself more than ever, yet I havn't been excessive about my diet or exercise in over a year. In that time I have however not been able to control my diet and eat way too much. Sometimes all I can think about is food even when I'm not feeling hungry. I always feel bloated and fat. I think I'm absolutely disgusting and ugly. I can't tell you how much I hate myself. Besides being obsessed with my weight I hate the size and shape of my eyes, the shape of my face, nose and lips. I hate my deformed butt, my fat thighs, my jiggling arms, my small boobs, my lumpy stomach my cellulite, and even my toes. Though most people say that there's nothing wrong with me and I'm skinny and beautiful, I never feel it...EVER. I've had liposuction when I was 19 years old. At that time I was 135 to 140 lbs and 5'8. I can never stop thinking about the things I hate about myself. I even tried purging again a few days ago. I used to cut myself but just think about doing it now. Alot of times I get suicidal thoughts but Im sure I wont act on them. Tonight I hated myself so much I slipped away from my boyfriend and locked myself in the bathroom and cried for an hour and kept clawing myself out of frustration and disgust. My mom has always made comments about my weight or looks, and I never feel good enough for her even though I know she loves me. My brother admitted to me that he told people he didn't love me when I was fat a long time ago even though he too went through his weight issues and starved himself too. I'm sorry this is probably all over the place and confusing, I'm just typing whatever comes to mind this isn't even the whole story believe it or not. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I don't know if I just have the mindset of someone with an eating disorder, if I'm OCD about my weight, if I have body dysmorphic disorder, a combination of the three, or something else i haven't thought of before. All I know is I need help but I don't have the money to afford it, so I want anyone's opinion on what they think of me, what may be wrong with me and what I should do.

I scraped both my knees 2 days ago (I am clumsy and fell knee-first onto the pavement) and it is hurting like a sunnuva gun!      I woke up the morning after the incident and it was stinging and I couldnt walk or move well, but later that day my knees started THROBBING. My dear boyfriend drowned my knees in hydrogen peroxide, slabbed on the neosporin, gave me a tylenol, and I laid on the couch in seemingly-paralyzed misery.       I woke up this morning and I am in serious pain (I know, wah for me). It hurts to the touch, is oozing blood/clear fluid, has a dark ring, swelling nicely, and the surrounding area is starting to turn a rather lovely shade of purple.      As I sit at this moment, my knee is throbbing, cant barely move, and I wish to take a couple Xanax and call it a day. My father put neo, a big bandage, and gauze tape stuff over both knees this morning. What can I do to stop the pain.    dont know how to post a link.. but here is a pic of it the morning after i fell.. ewww :]   <img src="http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/...

20090223080617AAhBsIo	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Please help diagnose my mom. What does this sound like she has?	My mom said for 4 months now, she has been getting pain on her left side. Pain in her breast, under her breast bone, her ribs and even up to the shoulder area. All on the left side. She says this happens off and on, here and there. But over the weekend, she had the pains really bad where she almost had to go to the hospital, but she didn't. She thought she could be having a heart attack but the pains subsided eventually. The doctor told her to take an aspirin. She said the pains calmed down and aren't as bad, but she still has them. What does this sound like?  She thinks it could be something where she has to see a gastrointerologist. She got an EKG a month ago and everything was fine.  She is worried that she could have cancer. She said she knew a woman that had pancreatic cancer and she had all pains on the one side too.  My mom got blood work done a month ago and everything was fine. Her cholesterol was a little high (250), but she is okay, Would any kind of cancer show in blood work by the levels being off? If they weren't does that mean she is fine? Or would she have to get specifically tested for something like that?

I'm 25 weeks pregnant(tomorrow) and I have been having terrible chest pain right below my breast bone mostly in the center of my chest/abdomen and on the right side. I feel it in my back and arms and it sorta just radiates all over. It comes and goes when it wants and not just after I have eaten. I used to only get it now and then, but it seems it comes at least twice a day now. I've tried TUMS, Prilosec, Zantac, and the doctor prescribed me Tagamet. None of it helps at all. There is a history of gallbladder problems in my family especially during pregnancy. I've talked to the doctor, but he sorta blows me off and says its just heartburn. Before pregnancy I can't remember ever having heartburn so honestly I don't know what it feels like, but wouldn't it be more on the left side if it was heartburn? Does this sound like heartburn to you or possibly a problem with my gallbladder? If gallbladder does it sound sensible to just go to the ER since my doctor isn't taking me seriously or is it not that serious of a problem? It gets so bad lately I end up in tears over the pain. I just don't know how to handle this.

I could understand people thinking I was ignoring if it was in class or during boring tasks... I mean, it DOES happen then, but it also happens when I'm really excited about something. I've missed things I've been really excited to see because I space out. And it's gotten to be to where I can almost tell when I'm going to be spacing out more that day. It's like I can see flashes of light inside my own eyes, except it's always in my peripheral vision. Sometimes I'll hear a ringing with it or smell something rotting. Here in the past three years, my family has also noticed weird things in my sleep. They say that it'll seem like I am totally awake and aware for two or three minutes and I have zero recollection.That or during the day I'll notice scrapes and bumps that weren't there earlier. I don't remember injuring myself. I know it's not ADD.My friend with that already told me it can't be. I asked her because she has ADD and I was worried about it. I know it's not ADD. She said when I'm spacing out with her, it's like I'll just stop in the middle of a sentence for several seconds. Sometimes it can last over a minute and my fingers will twitch on one hand a bit or I'll pick at something invisible on me or I'll wander like I'm confused. My friends say it can be scary because I won't respond to anything. What's scary for me is when I get either deja vu, or what feels like the opposite of deja vu. It's like I'll space out and suddenly even in my own home I won't recognise any of my surroundings... it's like I'm in a stranger's house. And when I said I won't respond to anything, I mean it.

It's kind of ruff and dry. It looks like little circles, in a cirlce. It's smooth in the middle, but bumpy around the circle. I've had it for around 1 yr. Sometimes it will fade and then come back. But one thing I've noticed, in the summer, it was light and not real noticable. Since it's been winter, it's gotten darker and a lot more noticable and bigger! A lady I work with says it's ringworm..

I've used an anti-fungus cream for a month, and the first time I used it, it burned a little but it hasn't went away. I had a dream it was skin cancer, which really freaked me out! Anyone ever had this before? It doesn't itch nor does it hurt. I haven't been to the doctor yet because I just got insurance. Should I go to the doc first or a dermetologist?

20090223084052AA3NtGF	Health;Diet & Fitness	Trying to get back in shape, please read my plan and suggest or comment, thanks?	Pretty much gained like 45 pounds in 2 yrs. I am 20 right now and 240 pounds. 5'10. I used to work out all through high school,      I started exercising about a week ago (cardio). I do 45 min on a latteral exercise bike. It is moderate-intense (more towards intense side). Machine says i do 13 miles and burn around 650 calories.      I usually take a day off (sat). Is there anything else I should do?      And for diet, I try to stay away from fats, and processed food, fast food. Also drink lots of water. I also like to eat a protein bar after, i exercise, it helps me get through the next day. Any other suggestions on post and pre exercise diet would be appreciated.      And lastly weight training. havent started this yet, but how often should i do this along with my cardio.      Thanks

Now, the swelling has gone down, but on the left side of the knuckle there is a big bump that is hard and boney like. There's a small lump on the right side too, but you can only feel it and not touch it.    does it sound like it could be dislocated? or is it a simple break?    if it was dislocated, would the hosp do anything other than tell me to keep the splint on?    i've broken this finger twice before, doing the same thing, if that'd important...

20090223082630AAiv8n0	Health;Women's Health	Is this how men would react if they had periods?	If Men Had Periods...   Since history was recorded, male human beings have built whole cultures around the idea that penis-envy is "natural" to women - -though having such an unprotected organ might be said to make men more vulnerable, and the power to give birth makes womb-envy at least logical. In short, logic has nothing to do with it. What would happen, for instance, if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate and women could not? The answer is clear - menstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy, masculine event:         Men would brag about how long and how much.         Boys would mark the onset of menses, that longed-for proof of manhood, with religious ritual and stag parties.         The US Congress would fund a National Institute of Dysmenorrhea to help stamp out monthly discomforts.         Sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free. (Of course, some men would still pay for the prestige of commercial brands such as John Wayne Tampons, Muhammed Ali's Rope-a-dope Pads, Joe Namath Jock Shields - "For Those Light Bachelor Days," and Robert "Baretta" Blake Maxi-Pads.)         Military men, right-wing politicians, and religious fundamentalists would cite menstruation ("MENstruation") as proof that only men could serve in the army ("You have to give blood to take blood"), occupy political office ("Can women be aggresive without that steadfast cycle governed by the planet Mars?"), be priests and ministers ("how could a woman give her blood for our sins"), or rabbis ("Without the monthly loss of impurities, women remain unclean").         Male radicals, left-wing politicians, and mystics, however, would insist that women are equal, just different; and that any woman could enter their ranks if only she were willing to self-inflict a major wound every month ("You MUST give blood for the revolution"), recognize the preeminence of menstrual issues, or subordinate her selfness to all men in their Cycle of Enlightenment.         Street guys would brag ("I'm a three-pad man") or answer praise from a buddy ("Man, you are lookin' good") by giving fives and saying, Yeah, man, I'm on the rag!"         TV shows would treat the subject at length. * "Happy Days": Richie and Potsie try to convince Fonzie that he is still "The Fonz," though he has missed two periods in a row. * So would newspapers.(JUDGE CITES MONTHLY STRESS IN PARDONING RAPIST.) * And movies. (Newman and Redford in "Blood Brothers"!)         Men would convince women that intercourse was more pleasurable at "that time of the month." Lesbians would be said to fear blood and therefore life itself - though probably only because they needed a good menstruating man.         Of course, male intellectuals would offer the most moral and logical arguements. How could a woman master any discipline that demanded a sense of time, space, mathematics, or measurement, for instance, without that in-built gift for measuring the cycles of the moon and planets - and thus for measuring anything at all? In the rarefied fields of philosophy and religion, could women compensate for missing the rhythm of the universe? Or for their lack of symbolic death-and-resurrection every month?

20090223082353AAosdVG	Health;Mental Health	My husband is active duty in the Army and checked himself into a mental health facility...What to expect?	My husband is active duty in the Army and checked himself into a mental health facility...What to expect?   My husband has been active duty in the Army since October. Ever since we arrived at his duty station he has been depressed and has said that Army life is not for him. He started doing drugs and ended up failing 3 drug tests. He had been given 45 days extra duty, loss of rank and pay and they told him that he was going to get discharged from the military. Then I found out I had a miscarriage and we both really took it hard. He has lost all motivation and last night he said he could not take being here any longer and admitted himself into a mental health facility. We have been together since 2001, and I have never seen any signs of depression, or drug use prior to arriving here. I love him with all my heart but need advice on what to expect. I really am un familiar with everything about the military ( I've only been here a few months) and the center he checked himself into isn't on base, it's just approved by tricare. I am scared for him, and wonder what this facility that he went to is like, and if he will be able to check himself out. I have tried calling the facility and they won't give me any information. They said a case worker would contact me and couldn't give me a timeline. I'm sorry if I'm babbling, I just need to hear some advice.

20090223082259AAt0Eu4	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Extremely Stressed about HIV?	This is going to sound stupid, but these are some things I have been thinking about.      I had sex with an older woman (30 years old) at the end of last July without a condom.  Since then I have been doing a lot of activities with good amounts of energy for the past 6-7 months.       Since August I have been smoking cigarettes, pot, and being genuinely unhealthy. I'm pretty much your normal college kid. I notice I am sometimes tired (not to the point that I can't get up, just a little fatigue) maybe from drinking coffee a lot and smoking.       I have lost a lot of weight over the past few months (from 148 to 132 over past year). This could be from minor exercise and not eating that bad. I also have a little joint pain sometimes that isn't that painful but a little annoying.      I haven't experienced any other symptoms and there is probably good reason I have these symptoms because of smoking cigarettes.       I got tested a week ago and they said it takes 3 weeks to get results in. I am going through tons of stress thinking about it because this is my first std test I've ever had. It has been 6-7 months, do you think I have HIV? I know that symptoms might not show for a real long time, but do you believe their is reasonable suspicion to have it?

I had weight loss surgery about a month and a half ago and I've cleared by my doctor to start more rigorous exercise. I'm a "light weight" when it comes to this surgery, which means I can expect to lose about 2lbs a week. That's great and all, but what I really need is to tone up. I'm going on a cruise with my family and boyfriend in the beginning of April, and I have a little over 5 weeks to tone up. I know I can't expect amazing results or anything, but I want to make sure that I do everything that I can to get in as good shape as I can (though obviously I'll have to keep up my exercise after the cruise to keep toning for the summer/until I reach my goal weight). I have a recumbent bike that I use for about 30mins a day, as well as the TaeBo Cardio & TaeBo Flex and Turbo Jam videos. I haven't used either in a long time, but I was thinking of starting to. So, what's the best exercise for me- assuming I do either Tae Bo or Turbo Jam (or both?) and combine that with my bike cardio (maybe up that to an hour)?. Thanks!

They became so severe that I went to the emergency room and they gave me a steroid  and benadryl IV.  I went home that night and got up the next day and still had some hives but not as bad. But then the next morning only 2 days after I went to the emrgency room I woke up and had to go back into the emergency room because my face was swelling and the hives were back in full force.  My feet were swelled up along with my face.This time they just gave me an IV of benadryl.  They also have me doing the prednisone pack for 5 days.  Can an allergice reaction really last this long when I have been taking the benadryl and steroids?  I have never broke out in hives before so I am just assuming I was allergic to the Augmentin, but I took it for a week before I even broke out. Is that possible to take a medicine for a week before breaking out?

My throat gets itchy and I start to cough and clear my throat.  It's a bit annoying, but nothing more.  I read up on food allergies and it seems that I could be allergic to any part of what goes into making chocolate , not just cocoa beans.  In fact they said most chocolate allergies are in the mixture.  The information I read said either quit eating it, or experiment to find what products or brands cause the reactions.  I've been eating as many different kinds of chocolate and chocolate ice cream as I can, and haven't found a pattern to the reactions yet.  I may never figure it out.  My question is, since the reaction hasn't gotten any worse can I keep eating chocolate?  Is there such a thing as a safe food allergy?  I really don't want to give up my favorite food.

Hi,      Ever since i had a viral infection approx 5 months ago i have had one swollen tonsil (quite a lot bigger than the other). I had a blood test and it came back clear.       Around  6 weeks ago i found a small lump in my breast and the lump is in a very similar place to a lump I had in the same breast around 2 years ago. This lump was quite large, i had i biopsy done and it turned out to be benign and disappeared after a while.       I have a hospital appointment this week (which my doctor made in 2 weeks-is this normal?) to get the current lump checked out. I am a little concerned due to the my swollen tonsil. Could they be connected in anyway? And would the blood test have shown cancer?      Also is it common to get lumps in very similar places?      I am 24, don't smoke or drink and both my great grandmothers had breast cancer.      Any feedback is much appreciated, thank you

My wife and I are at 32 weeks of pregnancy right now and we need to find a pediatrician to tell our midwife this week at check-up.  We've been researching options, and we want to find someone who is open to both conventional medicine and natural approaches.  We'd like someone who isn't necessarily a homeopathic/natural medicine doctor, but someone who is open to such ideas and approaches.      Are there any websites out there that might list pediatricians like this?  Google has a few reviews listed for different physicians, but no real information concerning approaches or what different parents have found, and this would be very helpful with our research!

20090223092001AA9dKyQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	What should I do if I'm consistently being diagnosed incorrectly?	I have been to one doctor, she told me my hba1c was 5.9, I'm borderline, stay away from white potatoes, rice, and breads, and pastas, and fruit juice.  She didn't do anymore evaluation, and as a matter of fact, I had to push her to check my blood sugar, because she was going off the hba1c for 3 months prior to the doctor's visit.  I told her this time I'm feeling differently, urinating a lot, thirst, drymouth.  Of course to no avail, she didn't do any further tests, and told me to avoid certain foods.  So I changed doctors, this doctor took an HBa1c again, said I was 5.4, and that I wasn't diabetic at all, but that I was hypoglycemic.  I'm confused.  How can I not be diabetic, but I have most of the symptoms of a diabetic, including unexplained weight loss?  I don't have the blurred vision as of yet.  She just told me to eat several high protein meals throughout the day, and she told me I had a Vitamin D deficiency.  Anyways, I'm getting a little annoyed at this point. I go to two different General Physicians, and they both seem to be taking me for a joke.  Now I feel like I'm going to probably have to die within the next year, because I maybe a diabetic, which I'm darn sure I am, no medicine, no treatment, no insulin nothing.  I was trying to see if my doctor could prescribe me the blood glucose meter, that my insurance would cover, but she keeps telling me this mess about not being diabetic, and the other one claims I'm not one as of yet either.  What do I do?  I'm freakin PISSED!!!!  These people are toying around with my life.  I have a young son, and I am a single parent.  I'm trying to get a grip on my health, and I'm getting the freakin runaround!!! Please Help or advise me?!!

Sadly was diagnosed with it a few days ago by the psychiatrist, but I intend not to let it run me down or take over my life. Some of the questions I have asked before in the past though I feel as though some members on here have criticised me, but others perhaps may not see it that way.       Just last year, I did an exam in Human Biology; it didnt go to plan as expected, and I came out quite angry, as my English one went well. I stupidly went onto YA and wrote things like how I was so angry, why should I work and study to get a job and pay for the Poles over here, wanted to hit out, blah blah blah. Some people seemed to approach the matter calmly, but here is one answer I got:      "It sounds like you are focusing your own self anger for not studying adequately at those you prejudicially have deemed inferior. Intead of listening to what your feelings are saying (study more and take responsibility for yourself), you are blaming others for what they have no control over (you). The other people that you are deriding are just trying to do the same thing you are trying to do - get by the best they can. If you want to grow up to be a spiteful, hateful person, go for it. You'll get little sympathy from most, and you'll be a fairly miserable person. The path you choose is up to you. However, no one else is responsible for your choices except you. So grow up and take ownership instead of being a brat who's stuck on blaming."      I think because I was very unwell at the time, I really went mad at this individual. Another girl (who's answer got deleted) said I had **** grades and I was a nut job. Even though I passed my English and got a Grade A in Psychology lol.      So do you think answers like these are justified, or do people with this disorder tend to overreact a little? Just trying to see so that I can begin to help myself. Thanks.

Is this normal to be bleeding so much? I'm fatigued, bloated and all around just exhausted. I want to stay on this prescription, but I am uncertain if what I am experiencing is normal. My doctor and I have spoken, only to say "stick with it" and I'm not so certain I want to.      Thanks for any advice or answers to this drug.

20090223092437AAKFhfI	Health;Diet & Fitness	Doing weights 3 times a day rather than all in one go?	So I'm trying to build muscle and lose weight at the same time. I know that that in itself is a hard thing to do, but concerning the muscle building, I am benching 3 sets of 8 on 50 kg three times a day every other day, 3 sets of pull ups on 50 kgs three times a day every other day and 3 sets of ten dumbbell curls on 7kgs three times a day every other day.   Is this the right way to go about it? I mean should I be doing it all in one go rather than splitting it up throughout the day?   I have a multigym so I can just go upstaris and do them any time I want.   Concerning the recovery of my muscles, am I interupting the recovery of my morning workout by doing an afternoon workout?   I hope this is clear enough to understand, if it isn't please ask any questions and I'll answer them in the extra details part.   Cheers in advance.

20090223094528AAfaUuM	Health;Mental Health	Worst day of my life?	so today started of alright, my first day of school.. again in a year.. i guess i woke up angry or watever, and had a little fight with my mom about my school shoes ( I got them a size too big and didnt want to wear it ) so then my mom went into victim mode, and my dad yelled at me and my mom cried because i hurt her.. then suddenly after the drama at home my dad went al friendly again and gives me his daddy love wen he touches my arms or back or he just looks too protective..   so then i got to school and i cant function normally, im dead nervous and i just had a break up from a guy that didnt treat me right, if i didnt leave him sooner he probably would have hit me, but there ar alot of stories goin on around in town, but he didnt rape me or anything, he just didnt treat me right emotionally, he was very jelous.. anyway so then i burst into tears at school after i walked up and down and couldnt find my class for the 5th time.. then everybody looked at me weirdly and they treat me weird.. im on my second day of bipolar medication, my moms actually, but she suggested that i take it.. so then after i had the worst day of school, i got home and my big brother was all pissed off and started hitting me and my brother, he bent my arm over and then i hit him back and then he hit me and threw me into a chair while im crying and screaming at him and then i threw a mirror at him and he continued hitting me with **** and he hit my brother on the head a couple of times with a large smile on his face ( his 22 ) (me and my brother are 17 ).. so then my mom came home from the dentist and my big brother said that we are **** and he cant live with us, so my mom came and screamed "what the **** is wrong with you"  and she managed to pin me up the bookcase and held my face and throat and smacked me a couple of times, i think 5, so then she said im mentally fucked and i treat her like **** and im fucked up and i cant do anything right and im a fucked up child and then she drove around town and baught alcohol and came back and said she's terribly sorry for what she did and she wants to help me but i dont open up enough and that i dont spend enough time at home and that she wants the old me back.. so heres a short summary of the past: mom: attempted suicide 4 times, bipolar, alcoholic ( when i was 15 i really tried hard to help her ) use to have abusive parents Dad: gambler, drives like a maniac, abusive, cheater, controlling, drug addict, second daughter from another woman.  brother: abusive, narcissistic. so im really confused at the moment, because she's in friendly mode again, but then a little mistake i make she nods her head in disbelief.. i dont know what happened but a couple of hours flew by and i cant remember much of it, and i feel absolutely nothing right now.. i just need to know if this was abuse or if they just tried smacking the "crap" out of me..

I have had recuurent bowel obstructions due to adhesions from past surgeries.

I'd like to also add all of these past obstructions were DX at this same hospital, so my past records should have been easily available.

The websites make it sound super serious. I got it yesterday. I noticed it last night at my boyfriend's house, when I went to the bathroom. I thought maybe I was getting my period, but when I got home three hours later, not only did it hurt a bit to "go" (the "burning" sensation they talk about). My friends (my closest friends...I wouldn't announce this to the world) say I probably just have my period, but it's not. There's just not that smell, and it definitely doesn't look like it.   Anyway, so within a half-hour, I noticed I was (and still am) continously bleeding and I feel like I have to go all the time, but when I actually do go, it's like, nothing.   And today, it's still bleeding, but it's not really any heavier so it's NOT my period. And when I go, it has this weird...smell...   It's really awkward and I'm kind of scared, but because of money issues, my parents can't take me to a doctor.   Can you please help me? I'd be forever greatful!!!

Most of the time I slept during the day and night. I slept on my left side always. I was on that side so much that my left upper leg got numb. Well for a whole year after that my upper leg on the left side was numb and tingly with the pins and needles feeling. I assumed that I cut the circulation off on that part of my leg since I was laying on it so much. When I shave I cant really feel it in that numb spot. Well, it finally went away for a year. Now its coming back and I have the numbness and pins and needles again. It really hurts too. And now its even going into my knee.  What could be wrong?

20090223090156AAdRSeF	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	My skin problems keep getting worse.  Can anyone help me?	hello.  I've been having a lot of skin problems lately and i'd like to get some feedback and hopefully some insight about what could be going on.        OK, about eight years ago, i noticed that after i washed my face the skin on my nose looked dull as if there was a film covering it.  so, i began to rub it off with a moist towel.  i think it was a dead layer of skin and it would come right off and reveal shiny, normal looking skin underneath.        Then a couple years after that, i started to get what appeared to be dandruff flakes in my eyebrows.  The flakes would come right off after being scratced, but the skin underneath was bright red.        Then a couple years after that, after shaving my skin would develop small areas of bright red patches which would fade right away.      Now, the bright red patches of skin develop on their own, and cover much of my beard area.  It is 100X worse after I shave.  The skin stays red for days after shaving, i develop small red bumps on my chin, and it ends up peeling days later.  Plus, i have noticed that i've started to get a build up of what looks like flaky dandruf in my ears (not red at all).       Whatever this condition is it seems to be spreading.  I went to a dermatologist and he wanted to put me on an antibiotic which he said would work as an anti-infalmatory (I haven't gotten the prescription filled yet).  But he hasn't been able to tell me what it is.  he says "it's probably my time to get ruddy" and that it's just dandruff on my face.  I know that it's probably too early for him to tell what it is, but the guy ignored many of my questions gave off an attitude of who cares.  Anyway, I'm going to go to a different doctor because I'm not satisfied with his diagnosis.  I want to know if anyone has experienced any skin problems like this or might know what it could be?

20090223093043AAEg34l	Health;Mental Health	Why do I restrict myself mentally from achieving the best?	Whilst comfortable financially I seem to have real difficulty lavishing on myself.  I often think many things are simply too expensive for me or I worry my wealth will run out or be taken away.  This mindset also affects other areas of my life, thinking some jobs pay too much for me e.t.c. Perhaps it's down to my upbringing but surely now I'm an adult it shouldn't have such a significant impact on my lifestyle.      Anyone have any tips on how to overcome this mental imprisonment?  Its really affecting what I strive for, which isn't always the best life has to offer.  It's as though I think things are too good for me.  Same when it comes to men, I'm often too timid to assert my wants and needs in case it puts them off.        Any suggestions??

20090223093717AAhOK1Q	Health;Diet & Fitness	NEED ABS BACK BY JULY!!!?	Okay so I'm currently 5"7 and 125 lbs. I used to have abs when i was skinnier (and more fit!). I still have them a little and they show but only if i flex alot. I need to get em back by July...August latest. I've been working on them lately (it helps that i have fitness right now in Health) but i cant seem to work them hard enough in the time provided. I dont have much money and at home i do crunches and situps and use an exercise ball and everything. Anywhere i look it costs money for a good guide to what to eat and how to tone your abs. So if anyone could share some tips on how i could work on my abs SPECIFICALY, also on how to decrease my body fat %. Im sure its not very high because i have quiet an athletic build (no im not some fat kid wishing he had abs, lmfao). So yea can anyone help me it'd be much appreciated thanks!            P.S. So far the best thing i've found that works out my abs is to start in a pushup position and then slide my feet across the ground so my knees are under my chest then back out. If you do this fast and often you start to feel it and its working better then crunches and situps (which are hurting my back anyways). Ive also heard they arent that good for abs, but for general fitness.

I was walking back to my dorm, and a girl about 30 feet in front of me threw up.  she had her back to me, and i gave her about another 30 foot wide berth around her as i walked past.  She then crouched down kind of sideways.  I want to know if its possible that, if she was throwing up from the stomach flu (Norwalk virus), how possible given the distance, and everything, and i didn't go near her, (but it was windy out) that the particles which contained the virus could have gotten to me.  I wasn't next to her, i was about 30-40 feet back.  so, how likely is it that i would have gotten it?  i didn't pass next to her but made sure there was a ton of space between us as i passed around her.  it was basically in a parking lot.

20090223095005AAv9WCQ	Health;Mental Health	Why don't antidepressants work for me?	Okay, so I've been diagnosed as depressed and put on antidepressants. At first they had me on Paxil because of my anger managment problem. While it did keep me from blowing up, it also made me feel even more numb. The sudden mood swings I used to have is what kept me feel attached to this world. So I got myself off of it. I still feel numb, but at least I can feel some extreme emotions from time to time.      So next they put me on Zoloft because of my numbness. I wasn't thrilled to be put onto more antidepressants especially since I didn't mind too much of the numbness. Anyway, that didn't do anything for me either. Except cause me to gain weight and again I couldn't feel even extreme emotions.      After that I was put on Lexapro and once that failed I was put on Effexor. Effexor actually caused me to sleep around twenty hours at a time so I immediately got off those. The rest I've taken at least four months to about a year.       So, can anyone tell me why nothing's working?

20090223095534AAocsIi	Health;Other - Health	Do I need to get help / Should I get help for drug addiction to morphine and opiates?	I have been using drugs since I was about 18 years old.  I started taking a 10/325 Vicodin here and there when I was about 16 when I could get a hold of them.  I always had control over the drugs I took, whether it be Vicodin or Percocet.  However, at the current point in time, I have been abusing morphine.  I have been taking about 180mg of extended release morphine a day, and now that I don't have any I feel shaky, sweaty, and I get goosebumps on my skin, and I get depressed about what I have done to myself, trying to think about how I did this...  My question is do I absolutely need the supervision and help of a physician to get through the withdrawal ahead of me, or do I need to just kick it out?  I haven't taken any morphine in two days.  I've been taking Xanax (about 3 or 4 mg in one day) on Friday and Saturday, and yesterday night a friend gave me 2 10/325 Hydrocodone APAP pills, and 2 10/325 Oxycodone APAP pills.  I took them both at the same time at night time, and I felt OK and fell asleep.  However now I don't feel so good.  I'm getting chills, sweating, feel sick, feel like I have a head cold, etc...

I've dabbled in NUMEROUS amounts of other drugs (not proud of it), but this is the worst I've felt from all of them.  Should I take the morphine withdrawal seriously?

My arms and legs are covered and I don't remember having injured them. I went to see a dr several months ago, my iron was tested as was my blood to see if it clotted properly. All that was fine. Why am I bruising like this? I have not been doing any strenuous activities- nothing that should leave bruising.

I'm in my late 20s and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am on a combination of medications for it which generally work really well. Prior to being diagnosed with bipolar I self harmed for about 4 years, at worst several times a day for at least a year, but I've been "clean" now for about 6 months.      I still infrequently get really strong urges to self harm, and am struggling with that right now. Just wondered, anyone who's been through this and got through the other side, at what point did your urges to self harm totally disappear?

20090223095936AAO5Wyu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Dust/pollen allergy, face constantly swollen, what should I do?	I have been suffering from it for over a year, and got treated for conjunctivitis, then it was discovered that I was allergic. I was tested, it's allergy to house dust and pollen. The doctor prescribed me the pills, and I made one round of allergy shots, when they inject you with congealed pollen and dust. They said that if I do it several times every 6-8 months, I would be better. I am about to have the second round in one month. Meanwhile, I made my apartment dust proved as I was told, removed the carpet, wash the floor with a wet duster every day, and so on. I do not use/touch everything with pollen, including flowers and cosmetics. The problem is, I can't eliminate  everything, for example, yesterday I touched a really dusty can in the supermarket. When I get exposed to an allergen, my face starts swelling, from my eyes down to cheeks. I become really puffy, and my eyes disappear. I take pills, but they do not help me at all. Together with my doctor we went through a selection: altiva, allegra,  claritin, loratadin, cetrin. They do not stop swelling, and they do not make the swelling to disappear. I am forced to wait till it goes on its own. I can't open my eyes properly, and I look really scary and can barely go outside. Are there pills which target this swelling? I read about epi-pens, but maybe it's too extreme? I am not in shock, I am just swollen around the eyes and cheeks every day of my life. What should I do? And I do use eye drops for allergy, but they do not help me either.

The doctor wants my wrist immobile and in a cast immidiately but i love baseball and school baseball tryouts are this week. the doctor says that i shouldn't push my luck and that if the tendons snap then i will need reconstructive surgery which will keep me out for over a year. but if i get the cast, i will be in the cast for 3 months. then i will need physical therapy for a period after. the doctor is making me wear a splint and wants me in it 24/7 except for showering which i have no problem with. i didnt make baseball as a freshman or sophmore, and if i dont make the team this year then there is a good chance that i wont stand a chance next year. the coach did say that i had great fielding but i was looked like i was swinging for the fences and missing alot. but i have focused back on contact instead of power. if i make the team then i will try and tough it out. if i dont make the team then im going to get the cast ASAP. i played a basketball game sunday with the brace and it felt fine. i also have been doing baseball conditioning for the past 2 weeks which involves throwing and hitting. i really want to tryout, my parents dont want to make the decision for me, but the more i think about it, the more i dont want to try out. please tell me what you would do in this situation

So i have my healthy eating down, i just need to incorporate time for fitness. I take the stairs if available, and i walk to class from my dorm on most days, and having a busy job, I'm often running around copying things and taking things to other offices so that helps a little. I do Tae Bo and Belly Dancing but how can I find more time? Thanks!

We are both doing a lot better since the diagnoses.  I have been doing a lot of research about this lately and I'm beginning to wonder if I've passed this to my other children as well.  All of my kids are at the top of their classes especially my middle child but that is the only thing that I can say good. I wonder if she only does well in school because she loves it.  She is always reading and writing.  I do not plan to actually seek help for her because she seems to manage well other than being extremely unorganized. My 3 year old is extremely hyper. Neither of my other girls have acted like she does, and her attention span is really nonexistent. But she is pretty smart too! She does know all the things a 3 year old should know and maybe more.  But getting her to sit down and putting her to bed is a fight.  I know that to some this maybe normal but you would have to see the fight to understand the problem.   Is it possible for all 3 to have it or am I jumping to conclusions?

20090223094558AA60iP6	Health;Other - Health	How close to be contagious?	I was walking back to my dorm, and a girl about 30 feet in front of me threw up. she had her back to me, and i gave her about another 30 foot wide berth around her as i walked past. She then crouched down kind of sideways. I want to know if its possible that, if she was throwing up from the stomach flu (Norwalk virus), how possible given the distance, and everything, and i didn't go near her, (but it was windy out) that the particles which contained the virus could have gotten to me. I wasn't next to her, i was about 30-40 feet back. so, how likely is it that i would have gotten it? i didn't pass next to her but made sure there was a ton of space between us as i passed around her. it was basically in a parking lot.    Anyway, if you could help me out and make me feel more comfortable and less anxious, that would be really great. Thanks.

This is not meant for serious diagnosis, I know that's not possible over the INTERNET and I need a psychiatrist, but I'm just curious what some people might think I have based on the following:      -I have depression (pretty much all the symptoms)   -I have had a few instances where I've thought I've heard music or a tv when it was the heater or there was no music   -I always feel like people are watching me, though rationally I know they are not   -I can go from happy or at least content to extremely angry and/or depressed with just one negative sentence from someone.   -I do not take criticism very well at all.  I always think "great, yet another thing I suck at, what else is new?" and never want to do whatever it was again.   -I don't trust people very easily   -Not all the time but a lot of times at work, I get very picky about how certain things are placed, sometimes I have to force myself not to fix it since it doesn't matter but sometimes I get "stuck".   -I take things too literally very often   -I am horrible at social interaction   -I never want to leave the house   -It was once suspected that I have aspergers syndrome. My half brother has full blown autism and my dad was told any of his future kids would have autism.   -I have hypothyroidism that's not well managed (forgetfulness, recklessness, apathy, leads me to not take my meds properly)   -I am very messy

20090223082540AASeaFi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	A friend’s wife, recently underwent surgical operation to evacuate fibroid tissues from her.?	The operating surgeon left about 120 minutes into the surgery, and 3 hours after he left she was wheeled out of the theatre alive by nurses and an anesthetist.      My friend believes that the surgeon left the theatre prematurely and failed or neglected to conclude or to supervise the conclusion of the surgical procedure he had commenced.    About 3 days later the stitches and pipes were removed from her, but afterwards she started complaining of exhaustion. A Doctor took her blood sample for a PCV test the next morning, which test result showed a reading of 23 points (against 28 points a day earlier), but nothing was done until about 7 pm when the Hospital brought blood to transfuse into her. This, they informed my friend, was to improve her blood level since she was not discharging blood.       The Doctor administered the pint of blood straight from the fridge and his wife went into a shock and started shivering. Shortly after this time, she could not breathe well and started gasping for air. She was then put on oxygen until the next day when she died.      Whats wrong here? I need answers!

I have mentioned to my doctor that lately I have been feeling extremely fatigued during the day. I go to bed about 8 PM and usually go right to sleep and wake up about 2 AM. I 90% of the time I wake up on my right side of face down with my head to the right. However, I get the impression that I wake up for brief, but frequent episodes during the night. On weekends and holidays I usually sleep 12 to 14 hours a night and sometimes even take naps during the day. I never feel as if I get enough sleep. All routine medical tests for what could possible cause fatigue such as potassium, hemoglobin and thyroid function, have all been within normal parameters. The only other thing I though of that might be causing it is a sleep disorder. When I mentioned this to my doctor, she just phoo-phooed that idea. I live alone, so there's no one to tell me if I snore or have episodes of apnea. How could I tell otherwise?

20090223095243AAoDurI	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do i lose weight in these conditions?	I am 17 years old, I am also very small for my age, approx. 5 foot. I am however, about 13 stone. I would love to lose weight as any girl would to look nice however there are certain things preventing me from doing the obvious.   Most people would tell me to exercise and diet, however i go to an college which takes up about 4-5 hours of my time daily travelling there and back plus then adding in the hours at college. This leaves me with no time to go to the gym etc. Also i live in quite a rough area and there have been many cases of attacks on people who go out to do exercises such as running around.   I would also diet but being a student and having to travel so far means that it takes up a lot of money and i simply do not have the money to afford things for diets such as plenty of fruit and veg. (that is a luxury when we can get it) and fresh meats to cook.   Please help me by suggesting a way in which i can lose weight quickly without affecting my diet and without going outside or to a gym.   Any helpful home exercises that are easy to do but affective will be greatly appreciated.

I went on it to help clear my skin and to give me contraceptive cover. I know you aren't supposed to stay on Dianette longer than needed, so seeing as my skin has cleared up quite well, I decided to ask to switch pills.       I have been prescribed Yasmin. The doctor said it is an alternative to Dianette and that it will help maintain the condition of my skin. I am on my last week of Dianette, I am due to start my 7 day break on saturday, and my period would be on wednesday. Last month I lost the last week of my pills, so I finished the last week of another pack, and didn't have a 7 day break, and moved on to the pack I am about to finish now.       When should I start taking Yasmin? Should I do it after I have had my 7 day break & period, or should I skip another period this month and take Yasmin straight away after finishing this pack? My doctor didn't tell me when to start Yasmin.      Thanks a lot

Over the past couple of months I've been working out at home and now I have a gym membership and would like to take full advantage of it.  I read that in order to build muscle it's advised that one should consume 1 gram of protein per pound that a person weighs. I would like to build more muscle but at the same time I would also like to slim down so I'm not so fat.  So in order for me to slim down I would still need a good amount of cardio in my workout.  Is this a good idea?  Plus can anyone recommend any protein supplements? I do find it difficult to (at least intentionally) consume 220+ grams of protein in a day.

Anyway, I'm on week 4 and am noticing results, but not as much as I'd like... So I thought, well, I guess maybe Protein Powder is important, so I went out and bought 3 Body Fortresss Whey Protein Powder jugs, (2lbs each). I am now in the process of having a post-workout protein shake.       I made my shake with       2 cups milk,    5 (ish) ice cubes,   1 cup (the cup that comes with the powder) of Whey   3 bananas       Is that good for the post workout drink? It makes about two cups of a fairly good size cup. Should I have it differently? More Whey since this is an extreme program?      I'm 135ish pounds, 15 years old.       Thanks for any advice! :)

A few years ago, at the age of like...11.         (I'm 17 now so...more then a few).       I was riding my Arab mare practicing barrels,.       Well, One of the straps on the saddle broke .      and it went right and I went left,.       Putting my wrists and arms infront of me.       Snapping both of my wrists on impact,       Like I knew wtf just happened. .      First time the wind was knocked outta me too..       I SOMEHOW walked a mile to get the horse, finish unsaddling, .      got on, and walked around a huge 2 mile long fence,.       trying to control an ARAB without a saddle&two broken wrists..       Well anyways I got home, told my parents I was home, .      knocked on their door and said I had a fall       and my mom came out and started screaming I started crying,.       my dad was 100% calm til I couldn't stop saying sorry.      (For leaving the saddle in the feild), then he started yelling...blah..      We went to the doctor, about 8 million stupid people came in the room<      They were broke for sure, I had to get a cast.      My summer was ******, I never went swimming again,       I wasn't allowed to ride(I still did) I didn't have fun         The casts stayed on about a year? I'm guessing.      They took them off, Kept one on.      The other hand was FREE!      Theyy put on a cast you could take off on the other.      So I didn't give a ****, That was the last time I EVER had that thing on.      Now I wish I could find it...   They told us to go to therpy and have them do stupid movments with my hands.      My mom said it's a waste of her time and money so we stopped goin      I didn't care then but i do now.      I have BAD arthritis!!!.      I'm sick of this, I've been dealing with it for years!.

Nothing works anymore BUT ONE THING      HOT water...really hot.<      I can't spend my life with my hand in the water...no.      My mom isn't going to take me back to the doctor.      I'm scared of the doctor(I'm no longer a virgin and I'm freaked she'll somehow find out)      But even if I wasn't scared we have no way or going back, no money and no health stuff.      No low cost anything eather please.      So whats my deal?, the rain doesn't do ****, I swear thats not why it hurts...      Idk why people say that..but what do I do?

That is a lot of points. I really don't know how to use all of them and that was one thing she made clear that it is very important you don't short yourself and you use all your points. So for instance this morning I had a 1 cup of Cheerios, about 1/2 cup of milk in my cereal and 1 cup to Drink. I also had a large apple and I was satisfied. Snack time i just had a WW yogurt (yummy) and a 100 calorie snack pack. I should be satisfied again for about 2 more hours. At which I will eat lunch. Now it seems I eat the most points at dinner. Is it ok to use most of your points at dinner as long s you are not eating all unhealthy? For instance last night I had a 3 oz piece of chicken with about a 1/4 cup stuffing, 1/4 cup corn/ 1/2 cup mashed potato's, 1/2 large biscuit and 8 oz milk. So I think everything added up to be about 11 points. Is that ok?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

I exercise twice a day for 20mins, n drink a cup of green tea before n after meals. However, my problem is my meals. . . I heard that carbs are bad (like rice, bread n potatoes) but i can't cut them out completely cos when i tried that i used to feel really weak. So, a few yrs ago my family n i switched from rice to wholewheat bread cos my dad had a heart attack n da doctor said it's too heavy for him. Recently, he went for a checkup n da doctor told him he's a bit overweight n should stop eating bread cos the yeast in it bloats your stomach n we should have rice cos it's digests faster. So what do i do? Rice or bread?

At my last visit he said my lymph nodes were swollen in my neck and my spleen was swollen/enlarged. He did blood work and I am having a chest and abdominal CT Scan this week.      I've had swelling in my neck for some time, for 3 years. When I had it checked out 2 years ago, I was told there was swelling, but it wasn't my lymph nodes. This was told to me by a nurse practionier at the GI doctor and this same family doctor who now says it is swollen lymph nodes. My gyn also checks my lymph nodes during my annual visits and he said nothing about swollen glands 8 months go.       If the swollen area in my neck was lymphoma would it have increased in size after 3 years? Or does the disease just spread to other regions and each node remains the same size?

20090223101752AAVht8j	Health;Alternative Medicine	Ginkgo Biloba, can it be bad for you, any alternatives?	I recently started taking Ginkgo Biloba because my memory was atrocious.  I had forgotten how to spell larger words and short term memory had almost totally gone out the window.  In addition to that, my confidence level had slipped in areas I had never had a problem before, such as becoming almost in a panic while driving. The Biloba helped...immensly.  I was taking a regimine of Ginkoba, three pills a day. I was on this regimine for three weeks with no problem. They switched their dosage by giving one pill a day, in a stronger dose.  I noticed that the next day (after I started the one pill a day) I started having heart palpitations. I continued to take the single pill and the palpitations got worse (having them every few minutes.) I stopped taking the product after the palpitations lasted a few days, and they have since gone away.  I'm a little nervous about starting again as the palpitations are very unnerving.  Is there anything I can do?

Occasional soreness, but that's it.  Last week I felt a pop in my right calf and then extreme soreness immediately after.  I couldn't finish the class (could barely walk out of the gym).  After a week (today) it's still sore, but much better.  Today I tried the class again and now it's my other leg, too!  Not near as bad because I eased up once it started bothering me, but still sore.  I don't know what's going on since I've never had these problems with my muscles and these classes are not new or different.  We do the same warm up each time and stretch afterwards.  Am I just getting old?  or maybe lacking in some vitamin?  I'm at a loss as to what's going on.  I eat well, but don't take any vitamins.

20090223105823AAu7n3k	Health;Mental Health	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

I have been to so many doctors and they can't seem to fix the problem. Please don't say anything about oral hygiene because I go to the dentist regularly and I floss and take care of my mouth. As soon as I finished brushing my teeth and tongue and rinse with a mouthwash, the bad taste always return to my mouth. I think that the problem is bigger than that and As long as this stomach problem exists, I will continue to have sour and bitter taste in my mouth which then causes my bad breath.

But throughout the day I've been having like a light period, def. not enough to wear a tampon but i am wearing a pantie liner. What could this be?

I have been stretching since and it is now wide enough to pull back when flaccid. I thought it would never work, and most people said circumcision was necessary, and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. It shows it is never necessary, as some people said.   Now that it's wide enough, it stll cant pull back though. It is attached to the glans, but the frenulum is only about 1mm long, if even. Is there anyway to stretch it as I cant see how it would be possible. I don't want to go to the doctor after going this far without,even  when people said sretching wouldn't work but i stuck at it. It's really annoying after spending months stretching my forskin that was so tight I could only see !mm of my glans. I'm 16 by the way. Can anyone help????
