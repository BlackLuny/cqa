20090220210823AAiC1n0	Sports;Wrestling	Big Show for Money in the Bank?	Here me out: Big Show definitely needs some hype after last year putting over a midget boxer, and way back when putting over a Sumo Wrestler, he should be rewarded and he would bring a different dimension to the MitB match. What if Big Show dominates the MitB match, still with fun spots by Morrison, Benjamin, Rey Rey or whoever else is in it.  Then he holds the briefcase completely disregarding the Brand Extension, and everyone wants to know who is he going to chose.  Say Orton beat HHH, and Cena beats Edge, he can pull off a Face/Raw reaction and Heel/Smackdown reaction.  Just thinking of Edge, Kennedy, and Punk, I think Big Show would be an interesting dynamic.        Am I trippin?

What is the best way to concealed carry in a suit. I will not be in the jacket all day so it has to be more concealed the simply under the jacket.       I need to conceal a subcompact pistol. It is a Ruger LCP .380      Right now I am trying out/using an ankle holster but would prefer a more readily reachable location. Such as some form of under arm or behind back conceal.      It can not show when I am not wearing the jacket or be overly restrictive. What do you suggest? I also am trying to stay away from belt/in waistband holsters (unless you know are a very comfortable/non restrictive one). What do you think?      What do you suggest.      Run down:   conceal a subcompact pistol (Ruger LCP)   In a shirt in tie (under the dress shirt)   as non restrictive as possible    preferably not ankle or in waist concealment.

Boston is a lock to make the playoffs and as long as KG is back for the playoff the will be fine, as best as they can be. If he doesnt return they will be a 2nd round exit. Pierce cant win without KG. Ray will carry him but Pierce sucks so bad he needs multi allstars pushing that wheelchais      Without Amare Pho will not make the playoffs.       Bynum hurts but LA will make the playoffs and be the #1 seed in the west, if he returns LA will be champs, if not I think they will still win but not as easily...      Boozer really hurt Utah's seeding.

20090220174924AASR5WI	Sports;Baseball	In a couple of years, could the Mets- Phillies rivalry be as big as the Sox - Yankees rivalry?	this rivalry is getting pretty crazy. it basically started before 07 when Rollins called the Phillies the team to beat. then before the 08 season when the Mets traded for Santana Carlos Beltran said "To Jimmy Rollins: this year, we're the team to beat." now this year its getting even more crazy. first the Mets sign K-Rod and thats where it starts. K-Rod says: "Of course we're gonna try to win the division, of course we're gonna be the front runners, of course we're gonna be the team to beat." then on the Mets WFAN Cole Hamels' runs his mouth and basically says the Mets are choke artist, and Carlos Beltran didnt take it to good, cuz now he says "Hamels can say whatever he wants, because i cant wait til we kill Cole Hamels this year."       and now Jose Reyes basically says "the Phillies wont shut up. we dont focus on them, they focus on us. we only focus on them when we're playing them. they win a world series, we congradulate them, but then they just run their mouths some more."       oh and in September Jose said it was the Mets year.      what do you think?

20090220174247AA5SOMW	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Will Cristiano Ronaldo be remembered as a United legend?	Will Ronaldo be remembered in the same way as Eric Cantona, George Best and Roy Keane. Personally I don't think so and I hope not.      As a player he has great skill and has contributed a lot to the team but as a person I don't like him at all. He dives and cheats any chance he gets and is totally arrogant. I know Cantona could be arrogant too but he had charisma and charm, unlike Ronaldo. What do you think?      The best answer won't necessarily go to someone who agrees with me but to someone who gives good reasons for their opinion.

20090220173630AA9qEvw	Sports;Football (Australian);Australian Rules	If we take away the bump, how will we compare players?	One of the great pleasures of being a rules fan is comparing players over the years...  Bartel vs Bartlett, Dunstall vs Brown etc etc      Some rule changes like dropping the ball if you bounce before you're tackled make that a bit harder, but now it looks like there's a push to take away the hard bumping shepherd from the game.      My question is, given all four of those players have had noses or jaws broken from fair bumps (and marginal ones), will we be able to compare the next crop of players if their Mum's don't even have to wash their gear after the game because they were never thrown to the ground?      My vote - if it's in the play and the elbows down, then it's fair!  Your opinions?

Could someone please tell me why a few of you all are blocking me? Not all of you, but I see that Bevo, Dallas Cowboy fan, and Ambassador #7 have blocked me for some reason. I guess its because you think I'm a troll or something. I know you all are looking for the trolls, so I won't take it personally. Just thought I'd let you know I wasn't a troll. This was probably unnecessary, but I just wanted to clear this up.      I wasn't on here during the football season, but you can ask Nikky who I am. I guess you all don't know me. lol I used to be a football regular myself, but I didn't come on for about 9 months. So if you think I'm a troll, I'm not. You can even add me if you like so you can see my profile.      The irony in all of this is that I gave Dallas Cowboys fan a BA the other day. But no, I'm not a troll.

I have also been told that it could have a chance to over penetrate and possibly injure someone in the next house or behind the target (this will be a home defense or CC gun). I dont want to have to worry about hitting bystanders, should i stick with a 9mm?      Thanks

20090220201821AAT9qmE	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Can one use sabot bullets and pyrex pellets in a black powder revolver?	I have a few questions about black powder revolvers. With muzzle loading revolvers it is recommended that you used black powder as the propellant and a ball as the bullet. However I would like to know if pyrex pellets could replace the black powder and a sabot to replace the ball bullet. First I am concerned with te plastic piece the falls off of the sabot after it leaves the barrel. In a revolver the bullet has to jump a small gap so I am worried that the plastic piece may fall off early, maybe damaging the gun. Also pyrex is a much more reliable but more powerful of a propellant. Could pyrex be too much for a handgun? Could it be dangerous? Also I have a bullet finding delema. Many muzzleloading revolvers are .44 caliber balls. I can only find .45 caliber sabots. If I choose to try and use pyrex and sabots can I use .45 caliber bullets?

20090220203720AAdVwhK	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Too late to get serious about soccer/football?	I am 17 and in my first of 5 years at university. I have played soccer ever since I was maybe 5 years old as a goalkeeper, although I never got really serious about it until my senior year of HS when I decided to go out for the varsity team. Best decision I ever made. That season was the greatest.      Anyway, I tried out for the university [RIT] varsity team (division 3) but got cut. The team here is pretty good. I made the club team, and It's great to stay involved in the sport, but I still yearn for the intensity and closeness of a real, down to business, serious team. Is it too late for me to really buckle down focus on soccer/football and be an excellent keeper and make the university team? Go on to USL or MLS, maybe even international? Besides training my *** off and perfecting my technique, are there any camps out there for college keepers?  I know I have the heart and dedication. I just need to focus on it.      Thanks

20090220202645AAzS7o4	Sports;Tennis	How do I get more pace on the tennis ball?	Heres a little bit about me: I am 4.0 player with a medium swing. I am a baseline defensive counter-puncher who uses a forehand slice with lots of underspin and control. However, when I open up the court and try to be offensive I simply can’t get enough power to put it away. The best way I can describe it is that the ball is simply going very slowly. Shoulder/Hip rotation combined with topspin has helped, but I still have to hug the baseline with my shots to get the winner. If my forehand shot lands in the service box or no mans land, forget it, an arthritic turtle could hit it back!   I’ve been told that my form is not the problem. I can hit both a windshield wiper forehand and what most call a “classic topspin forehand.” Both are generally consistent for me, and generate an average amount of topspin. I’ve also been told that strength is not my problem. I weight lift regularly, and work specifically on biceps, triceps, shoulder, forearms, and wrists.   I’ve briefly tried other sticks and found that a smaller head size seems to drastically help. This makes me believe that the racquet is to blame. I use…      Wilson H4      Head Size: 113 sq. in. / 729 sq. cm.   Length: 27.5 inches / 70 cm   Strung Weight: 9.6oz / 272g   Balance: 6 pts Head Heavy   Swingweight: 321   Stiffness: 72   Power Level: Medium-High   Swing Speed: Moderate   String Tension: 62 pounds      I have a hybrid stringing with Babolat Pro Hurricane Tour 16 String and Wilson Sensation 17 String      What kind of racquet do I need? Is that my problem?      ANY comments, ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Mr. McNasty or Don Vinnie as I usually call him has done some bad business in his career but is there one thing that sticks in your craw about him.?      1. The New York Screwjob of Wendi Richter   2. The Montreal Screwjob of Bret Hart   3. Making Bruno Sammartino a non-person with no history in WWE   4. Acing Chyna out of her contract due to HHH and Steph   5. Making Ricky Steamboat wear a Dragon Suit on his return to WWE and firing him for not doing a squash job for the Undertaker;   6.

Note: If you think he was negligent in Owen Hart'ts death, then of course that would be the worst..       Personally, it sticks in my craw that he fired Bull Nakano for possessing cocaine and kept other wrestlers around who were using drugs-one of whom is RIP and in the HOF; it may also depend how important the star was to the promotion and what drugs they were using--in particular one blonde guy with 24 inch pythons who said his prayers, trained, and . . . took his "vitamins".

20090220213522AAf4TE3	Sports;Football (American)	A Question For All NFL Fans...?	I know it's pretty well known that Steeler fans have a knack of basically invading other people's stadiums, which is why Roethlisberger says the biggest advantage playing for Pittsburgh is "we have 16 home games".       My question is two parts:       1.- Name your favorite team.       2.- The last time the Steelers came into your stadium, whether you         saw it on tv or in person, about what percentage of the stadium         was filled with Steeler fans?         I'm trying to figure out how legit this phenomenon is.

I've been skiing since I was little and I honestly don't remember much about people teaching me. I just do what I do and shred. But now that I've promised to teach this female friend of mine to ski how do I teach her?      I know the whole "pizza" or "wedge" thing, but how do I teach her to do turns and control her speed. She is a quick learner and I'm hoping to get off the bunny hill half way through the day. I helped a kid learn once before who was like a cowboy and I had him on blue runs by the end of the day. But that was ok because I could do a baptism by fire with him.        But this a female friend who I really don't want to ruin a friendship with for obvious reasons...
