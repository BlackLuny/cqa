20080704042459AAfzT02	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Music file format problem, really simple stuff, but I am completely computer illiterate. Can you help?	Here is my problem:    Some time ago I ripped the music from a favourite CD onto my laptop. The tracks are in mp3 format. Now, the CD has been damaged beyond repair, and so I want to copy the music files from my computer to a blank CD. The problem is that my CD player is not able to play mp3 files.    So, is it possible to convert my mp3 files into something that my CD player will be able to read? All I have is my laptop, no fancy electronic gismos. And if it is possible, then what file format should the files be? What can a normal CD player read?    Thank you so much!

Al ser buena me he planteado que por que vale tan poco en las tiendas (80 ) siendo de 8 megapixels, siendo que cosataban hace nada 200 .    Creo que es porque estan retirando las camaras de pilas normales, para poner ahora las de bateria de litio, y por eso las han rebajado.    Ahora mi pregunta: ?Existen pilas de litio para camaras digitales, y que tal funcionan?    Saludos y muchas gracias.

20070618212338AAnyjBP	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Ipod/Itunes question.?	I'm honestly not sure what to do. What had happened was that all of a sudden, my ipod wouldn't turn on, I tried all the tricks on the apple site to turn it on and it still wouldn't. It wouldn't even charge. Then I connected it to the computer and it began to charge alittle, but still wouldn't turn on, the apple sign showed up. Then I [Trying to remember] somehow refreshed the ipod and then it was all like it was brand new again, no music on it, it just showed different language options. Though it had said on itunes that the ipod had been corrupted. Then It said that I would have to restore it, but it noted that restoring it would make me lose all my music. When it says that I'll lose all my music, does it mean all the music on the actual ipod would be lost? Or on itunes, too? So I am stuck...Is there a way to get all my music back onto my ipod?       Thank you for all of your help.

20081017162736AA6Hg6s	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	HELP! Question about HDMI on the PS3?	A couple weeks ago I got an HDTV and bought an HDMI cord for my Ps3. I had to change the settings and stuff for the HDMI to work. I then moved my playstation to a non HDTV and I didnt bother bringing my HDMI cable. I've played my playstation on this tv many times but today the sound and everything worked except there was no picture. I couldnt see the game on the tv. Now...is that because my settings are still on HDMI? How can i change the settings back without my HDTV and my HDMI cord? Help please.

20070420202707AAR2tiJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Pre-paid phone questions?	Okay, so I've been back and forth looking for a pre-paid phone and provider. My current provider is Virgin Mobile. The service works fine and I'm happy with the monthly plan. I pay $34.99 + tax a month for 300 anytime minutes and 1,000 nights and weekends minutes...all of which I usually don't use up. I dislike the phone I have, and they honestly don't seem to have a phone that doesn't look like a little kid's phone. The Slider Sonic...I've read bad reviews about it. Same thing with the "Snapper". I don't really like either of them.       I want to go pre-paid, definitely. I'd like to have a set monthly pre-paid plan similar to what I have now, with so many anytime/nights and weekends minutes on that set paid amount per month. Not this 10 cents a minute stuff that I have to do the math in my head for each one. I make the monthly payment...delete my card info, and if it's used up...I don't get charged more. Looking for another service like that with better phones.

I don't know quite how to explain this, since I'm not that good with computers and such. Anyways, I was told online to download a DVD decoder or decrypter, and I downloaded a program called 'DVD Decrypter'. I tried using it, all it did was come up with a bunch of VOB and IFO files (I have no clue what they are). The VOB files are of its special features and trailers and can be converted through WinAvi and uploaded into my iPod. But the movie, including its menu is in the form of many IFO files, and I can't do anything with them except watch on the computer. How do I just extract only the movie itself (no menu) and make it compatible to be converted into being iPod friendly by WinAvi?

A little while ago my computer hard drive broke, I luckily didn't lose everything because I have a backup hard drive.  However, I had bought one song and one game off iTunes before I got the chance to put it in the backup drive, but I do still have the song and game on my iPod.  I downloaded a program off the internet and it copied the songs from my iPod to the computer, so I managed to save the one song I lost.  However, it wouldn't copy the game back on to the computer.  I have looked at many programs, and so far none of them will let me download the game to my computer from my iPod.  I really would like to know how to get my game back on the computer.   Oh yeah....and I don't want to have to buy anything.  Thanks!
