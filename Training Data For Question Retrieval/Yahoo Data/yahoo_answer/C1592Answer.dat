Some days are cheaper then others to fly.|`|AA11496012	Southwest flies between Seattle and Orlando but you have to go to Southwest Airlines' website.  They do not partner up with a travel website.  Also see if Alaska Airlines flies out to Orlando.  If they do, you can get a non-stop flight.  Don't forget to look at the travel websites as well such as http://www.kayak.com.|`|mX27tszPaa	I would stick to the internet for sure and don't spend the extra money for a travel agent.  I think that some of the best websites to look on are the big names in travel like orbitz, expedia, priceline, and travelocity.  They honestly are the real deal when it comes to airfare because they constantly are negotiating with the airline companies to get better fares. I also put a link to an ehow article below that tells you how to get super cheap airplane tickets.  That might help you too.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4764749_super-ch...    Good Luck!!

Otherwise try Camden, though I haven't seen any AAR stuff there recently.    Your best bet is online really. There is much more choice!

Ar5VHDiBaa	The Flamingo - FOR THE MONEY....... & it has everything you want in a hotel / casino. We've stayed at the big money hotels & we will never stay anywhere else.    The Pool is awesome, my wife & I hung by the pool all day & then hit the casino's at night BUT, we've been to Vegas several times & didn't "need" to see the town for the 1st time.    It's in the middle of the strip so if you want to walk to the other casino's you are in the middle PLUS I know you are a Country fan & Toby Keith's I love this Bar is right next door.... the food was "ok" but there was a Rock-a-billy band playing when we went over there.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	The Flamingo, Mandalay Bay, THE (that's what it's called, the THE), mgm grand, they're all pretty nice.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	Courtyard by Marriot is nice, but Bally's I think is the best hotel/casino on the strip for the money and remember what happens in vegas stays in vegas.|`|hnnMVO39aa	Depends on the age of the traveler... for the younger crowd I would suggest the Palms! It was my favorite! (I am 21)|`|puyAEPZyaa	I would definitely recommend that you book a room at Bellagio. Here is my run-down on Bellagio:    Location: Bellagio is located in the center of the Strip, so you can easily walk or take a taxi, bus, or the Las Vegas monorail to access everything else.    Atmosphere: Bellagio has a more upscale atmosphere, but is very inviting to all its guests. Bellagio carries more of an Italian theme throughout the resort, so tends to have a more romantic appeal to it.    Accommodations: Bellagio offers upscale rooms and suites that are elegantly appointed. The staff is very accommodating and the room service is above average. You can't beat a room overlooking the fountains in front of Bellagio.    Casino: Bellagio offers a variety of games and tables to suit anyone.    Dining: Bellagio offers fine dining, along with casual and contemporary dining. For fine dining, they offer Circo, Jasmine, Le Cirque, Michael Mina, Picasso, and Prime Steakhouse. For casual and contemporary dining, they offer Yellowtail Sushi Restaurant and Bar, Sensi, Olives, Fix, Noodles, the Buffet, and the Cafe. For dessert, they also offer Cafe Gelato, Palio, and Jean Philippe Patisserie.    Entertainment: Bellagio offers the one-of-a-kind Cirque du Soleil "O".    Nightlife: Bellagio offers the Fontana Bar, along with the Caramel Lounge and The Bank nightclub.    Other Amenities: Bellagio also offers a world class spa and salon, high-priced shopping in Via Bellagio and Via Fiore, and a beatiful pool area. Finally, Bellagio also features world-renowned fountains in the front of the resort, a beautiful botanical garden located inside the Conservatory, and an amazing Gallery of Fine Art.    Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip to Las Vegas!|`|6tGYe5roaa	Ooh are you going to Vegas?? I absolutely love Vegas. I have been there three times and might be going back again this year.    If you aren't looking to spend an arm and a leg, I would recommend Bally's. I stayed there the last time I went and it is a nice hotel and not expensive at all. It is in a great location. Right in the middle of the strip, surrounded by everything. Sure there are nicer hotels but they will be a lot more expensive. You can still visit all those hotels and play in the casino and go to the clubs/bars.|`|FPiKno2Kaa	mgm grand, venitian, ceasers palace and planet hollywood.  all those are lovely and in great locations.|`|CLXTxsoqaa	I've stayed at the bellagio and it was really nice. I couldnt tell you about the other ones.|`|uulh9ov1aa	Depends on what you're looking for. I stayed on the strip at the Luxor and I've also stayed at the same quality hotel just about a half mile off the strip called the Gold Coast, which I highly recommend. Wear comfortable shoes because you will do tons of walking if you go visit all the hotels on the strip!|`|6yJXae64aa	Hands up for MGM and Mandalay because of their great pool scenes.

My absolute favorite was Mandalay Bay.|`|AA11793059	I agree with xVh  "mgm grand, venitian, ceasers palace and planet hollywood.  all those are lovely and in great locations."

NK3VJgiRaa	Your question is very broad. I would Say the best place to visit in PR is Old San Juan. That is the old historic part of the city where you can see lots of sites like El Morro Fort. San Juan also has the best nightlife, shopping & entertainment.     For the best beach, you should go to Culebra island. They also have great snorkelling. The best natural sites are El Yunque rain forest, Camuy Caves & the biobay. The best manmade site (apart from everything in Old San Juan) would be the Arecibo Telescope. For the best surfing go to Rincon in the winter. For the best views go to the central area's like Utuado & Orocovis.|`|bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	www.gotopuertorico,com  www.travelhost.com  www.arecibobaytours.com  www.bacardi.com  www.donq.com  www.culebra.org  www.meetpuertorico.com  www.travelandsports.com  www.rincon.com  www.enchanted-isles.com  www.prhta.org  www.raic.com  www.culebra-island.com  www.museodearteponce.org  www.mapr.org    I love the west side of the island, towns as Rincn and Aguadilla, with its beautiful sunsets, beautiful, but not to crowed beaches.

23vKOyBraa	Australian "residents for taxation purposes" (the legal term - just think "Australians") are covered by the free (paid for through our taxation system) Medicare system. This will not apply to you unless you fit this description.    If you are a tourist you will need your own travel insurance (the same type that pays for lost bags, cancelled flights etc).    And if you are a student here - then as part of the conditions of that visa you will have had to arrange and pay for private health insurance (more like you're used to in America).    So, to simply answer your question: yes, free for us, no, not for you. ;)|`|9N6sW6KAaa	all of the above|`|0WYzUsjMaa	you will need to get travel insurance, i went to new zealand and ended up getting tonsillites and had to go to the doctors, it ended up costing me $62.50 and i didnt have travell insurance, even if your not sick i still say get travell insurance|`|s2IOyj8iaa	We have a public medicare system but as a visitor you will need to take out insurance.

xs2mpYjWaa	I wish you luck. At the moment, even Australians can't find work. The economy is so bad that people are losing their jobs and very few people are hiring. Obviously if you hire an Australia they will stick around for more then 6 months while a tourist won't.     My only thought we be that you have to find someone who would prefer to take on a tourist, I'm sure there are some. But unfortunatly you might have to be happy with fruit picking.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	I used to work at a restaurant in Coogee and we always hired one or two backpackers for casual positions.  Most of the cafes around there do, Bondi as well.  It used to be pretty easy for backpackers to find something.... although I haven't lived there for a while so am not sure how the current financial climate is affecting things.  If you go door knocking make sure you're presentable and keen.  Most employers in the beach areas have seen a lot of travellers come through and will know instantly if you'll be an asset or a hassle - experience isn't a big issue, common sense and punctuality are most sought after.

wgMh9qCkaa	For you and your sister, I suspect your biggest adjustment will be to learn to behave in a respectful and polite manner. The French, in general, are more old-fashioned and polite than most Americans today. Even the young people may appear very casual and loose, but are generally extremely polite and respectful to their elders. You will need to learn to speak to your schoolteacher with the proper terms of respect, and you will not be disruptive in class. You will rapidly need to learn some basic important words and phrases, the French equivalents of "Excuse me," "Please," "Thank you."  And when speaking to any adult, you will ALWAYS refer to them as "Madame" or "Monsieur." I don't know if your own family raised you to know how to be polite, as your notes at the top indicate otherwise in your nasty response to another Answerer, so I suspect this will be your biggest problem.

The doctors and nurses on call when you arrive at the emergency area will examine your wife and since the pain is in the chest, they may take her blood pressure. If she has a history of heart disease or stroke in her family, mention this to the attending physician.    If they feel there is anything seriously wrong, she will likely go to the head of the line and be admitted to a bed immediately and placed on an electrocardiogram.    If it is a case of severe heartburn or a chest muscle strain, you may end up waiting. Another thing it could be is a gall bladder attack, which often feels like chest pains from the heart area.    In the case of chest pain, my advice would be to not wait for a CLSC visit. There, you will wait 4-6 hours for a doctor to look at you for 5-10 minutes. The hospital is the better choice, even though wait times can vary.
Twzg9s0caa	There is a mobile home park in Victoria Bc where the rent is pretty cheap. It's for 55 plus.

If you are not a citizen of Canada, or a Immigrant with a work permit, you are NOT entitled to use our Provincial Health Care system.     You will have to purchase private medical insurance, before you come to Canada.     Depending on what nation you call home, you may need to apply for a visitor's visa, from the Canadian Embassy in the capital city of your country. That will take a number of months to be issued.    If you are able to get a visitor's visa, you will still have to be able to show that you have enough money or credit card balance to be able to support your selves, while you are in Canada, when you arrive here.  You will also have to have a paid return ticket , to get home.     Cheap living ?    That depends on your definition of "cheap " ?    You can stay /live in a homeless shelter for free, or pay $150 a night to stay in a 3 star hotel, it is your choice. Same thing with food and entertainment costs, and travel.      It sounds to me that you have some  unrealistic ideas about how we live here in Canada. I would budget at least $ 2000 CDN a month to live here, at the very least. So for 6 months that would be about 12  thousand dollars , above and beyond  the travel costs to get to Canada.    May be you need  to re-think this idea ?    Jim b. Toronto.      Jim B.

oeAUkiq5aa	Peking was Japanese pronunciation, but the fact is, Japanese were imitating Chinese pronunciation too, The Japanese use Kanji, and according to their pronunciation, 北京 should be "Kita kyo", not Peking.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the Chinese wanted to get rid of Japanese influence, it's the same why Koreans changed their capital's name to "seoul"...the former name in Chinese was "汉城", means "Han's city"|`|3u4HU7rdaa	oh have you been to a restaurant called peking garden? it's delicious. you should really go. unless if you're not into chinese....|`|a6JZjRG1aa	because there are no syllables "pe" and "king" in pin-yin thus they actually don't exist in Chinese language... <br>  <br>  to my mind, it's very fine Chinese capital has a Chinese name, not a silly word given by foreigners...<br>  <br>  (and the same concerns calling Chinese language as "Mandarin")<br>  (yes, again and again)<br>  (:P)|`|AA10305396	The answer to all these puzzling questions is really quite simple. The Chinese capital did not change its name but Chinese words became spelled in English differently. In Chinese, the name stayed exactly the same and most Chinese people are not even aware that some Westerners think that there has been a name change. The old spelling has been Peking, this is how the city appeared in most earlier discourse. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the government adopted the pinyin transliteration method and used this to write all of the proper names (including place names, people's names, etc) using the Latin alphabet. Theoretically, this was when Peking became known in the West as Beijing. In reality, however, the West has been using the old spelling long after it has been replaced in China. It is only sometime in the 1980s that China started to enforce its official name on all flights, sea routes and official documents. This is why the name Peking is still echoing in our minds and people continue to use it even today. Needless to say, it is easier to pronounce than Beijing, which is an important factor too.<br>  <br>  Both the old and new spelling are approximations of the Chinese sound, pronounced something like "pay-cheeng." The same pseudo-change is seen in the name of Nanking which is now written as Nanjing. Or remember the movie Chunking Express? Chunking in mainland China (where it is located anyway) is written as Chongqing -- it is the same thing under different spellings.<br>  <br>  A number of names did not change their spelling. Shanghai has always been Shanghai but this is because both the old and new spelling systems transcribe it the same way. The change from Peking to Beijing is perhaps the most dramatic because 1) it is the capital of China and thus one of the best known Chinese cities, 2) the change is relatively big. Tianjin, one of the main naval entry ports to China used to be written as Tientsin but since then the area lost its importance and few people remember its days of glory.|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	I think it was because "Peking" was the name under the Wade-Giles system of anglocizing Chinese words, that is, making them into a close approximation of English. Wade-Giles was popular until about the middle of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Pinyin is another method of anglocizing Chinese words and it is currently in use. Pinyin resulted in different English words from the Wade-Giles system. Pinyin strove to be truer to the original Chinese sounds of the words. The city itself did not change it's name, rather, the Americans and British changed the word they use to refer to that particular city, as well as many others that were changed from their Wade-Giles name to their Pinyin name. Another example is the city name is Yangchow (W.G.) which became "Yangzhou" (Pinyin)<br>  <br>  If you ask me, Pinyin is still lacking in representing Chinese words in English. I have studied it and looked at several of the words and thought, well that is not the way I would have picked to write that word if I had to find an English rough equivalent.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	it's always been the same. just different pronunciations. peking is the cantonese version. beijing is mandarin which is also the official language|`|1LlhqADoaa	In Cantonese,"北京" should be pronounce <br>  "bei ging", it is similar  to "peking"|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	The Chinese capital did not change its name but Chinese words became spelled in English differently. In Chinese, the name stayed exactly the same and most Chinese people are not even aware that some Westerners think that there has been a name change. The old spelling has been Peking, this is how the city appeared in most earlier discourse. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the government adopted the pinyin transliteration method and used this to write all of the proper names (including place names, people's names, etc) using the Latin alphabet. Theoretically, this was when Peking became known in the West as Beijing. In reality, however, the West has been using the old spelling long after it has been replaced in China. <br>  <br>  It is only sometime in the 1980s that China started to enforce its official name on all flights, sea routes and official documents. This is why the name Peking is still echoing in our minds and people continue to use it even today. Needless to say, it is easier to pronounce than Beijing, which is an important factor too.|`|lMH2cA1kaa	Peking and Beijing are different translations of "北京“. Peking was the translation made by westerners in an early dictionary while Beijing is the standard Chinese spelling (Madarin). <br>  <br>  There was a history behind the western version of translation.<br>  <br>  Many earliy European travelers to China were Jesuit priests. The first Chinese-English dictionary for Europeans was written by Jesuits who were mainly from southern European countries and speaking Romance languages. They transcribed what they heard in a way following their own languages such as French, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese. Unlike the English, In all these languages, the voiceless plosives /p. t. k/ are unaspirated. As the initial consonant of the Mandarin name for Peking is also unaspirated, the priests wrote down a ‘p’. The following vowel, or diphthong, is or at least starts as a half close front vowel, and the spelling convention for this in all the Western Romance languages is ‘e’ (or ‘é’ in French). The next consonant is also unaspirated, but pronounced in the palatal area, which is auditorily closest to the sound represented in European languages by a ‘k’ when it occurs before a front vowel, like in this case. The final velar nasal is a sound that occurs only allophonically in French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, so the nearest sound was used: [n]. This gives us the French version of the name Pékin, which was later introduced into English with an "g" added in the end. The spelling ‘Pekin’ was common at one time in the history.<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <br>  < <a href="http://www.amlinkint.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.amlinkint.com/forum/index.php</a> ><br>  < <a href="http://www.amlinkint.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amlinkint.com</a> >|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Beijing is the proper Chinese name for the city.<br>  <br>  Peking was the Western World's name for it.

8A0JdS7Xaa	In my experience you will find better manners and more pleasant dispositions from southerners but that doesn't necessarily mean better people.|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Southern people are more friendly and have that whole "southern hospitality" thing going on.  However, I find them a little intrusive and overly nosy sometimes, while I like the fact that northern people don't seem to be in your business too much.  For example, I went on my honeymoon in Arkansas and felt like everyone was staring at me all the time.  They kept hanging around our table when we went out to eat, asking a lot of questions about where we were from, where we worked, etc.  Kinda creepy.  I haven't had that problem when I've traveled north.  When you live in a southern town, you sometimes feel like everybody is in your business all the time.  However, if you need help with something, everybody seems to pitch in.  People definitely seem to trust each other here more, as well.<br>  <br>  The weather is better in the south during the winter than the north, but summers in the south are awful--very sticky and humid.  My favorite place in America by far is the southwest (Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, etc.).  I found people there to be very friendly, but not in an intrusive way.  It has a very laid back vibe, and the scenery is amazing.

The rifle represents the nation's determination to defend its freedom.<br>  The Mozambique flag was adopted on May 1, 1983. Mozambique gained independence from Portugal on June 25, 1975. The current Mozambique flag is based on the flag of Frelimo (the Mozambique Liberation Front), the organization which led the campaign for independence. The Frelimo flag was virtually the same as the current Mozambique flag but without the emblem on it.

AA10024451	Good reasons to go to Disney World? Wow.....what a question. <br>  <br>  I personally have been there 8 times, most recently from 1/24/09 - 1/31/09 (and the time before that was Sept 08). What I enjoy perhaps the most from a week-long trip to Disney World is that once I pass through the "Welcome to the Walt Disney World Resort" gates, all of my problems from daily life including work stress, economic stress, health stress......all of it melts away and my entire outlook for the week ahead is one of great fun and relaxation. <br>  <br>  The Disney World parks are among the cleanest amusement parks one will ever experience. <br>  <br>  While a vacation may be somewhat on the pricey side, depending on how you arrange where you'll stay, the kind of park tickets you'll need, and if you'll use the dining plan for food.......it is definitely worth it due to the great time you're guaranteed to have. <br>  <br>  Whether you're someone who enjoys all types of thrill rides, or whether you're someone who mainly enjoys great shows and parades.......there's something for everyone to enjoy over and over in each of the 4 Walt Disney World parks. <br>  <br>  From the "deluxe" resorts to the "value" resorts......all of them scream the theme of "family fun". There are hidden nooks to explore in all of them, and whether you're in a park or at the resort, be sure and join in the hunt for "hidden mickeys" (places scattered all over in which you can find hidden mickey-head-shaped logos, for example: in the tiles on the floor, in the landscaped bushes, on the walls or in the carpeting, and so forth).

I think NYC, then Chicago, then maybe Atlanta.  Definitely not L.A.  I associate it too much with gangs and drugs.  And where it isn't full of gang violence, it is the super-ritzy Beverly Hills type areas.<br>  I don't know why I only get that perception so strongly from L.A. and not from the other cities.|`|rEBItMaBaa	i live in hawaii right now and lived in nyc for a while and nyc is deff the place to be|`|pR2hy0bjaa	Now Its New York City i think.|`|11f67ece1475a18e8928d0a70e1f021baa	Chi Town is the place to be.

Buses (Greyhound or Chinatown) are the cheapest option, planes are the most expensive but fastest (assuming no delays and where you need to go is close to Dulles or National), and Amtrak is a compromise.|`|ScJAT0t9aa	A plane for starters.

There are tons of shows that you can go see (Carolina Opry, Dixie Stampede). There is the Nascar park with go-cart racing. Broadway at the Beach and Barefoot Landing for shopping. Also at Broadway, there is section that has different clubs. Pay one price and bar hop all night long. I stay at the Crown Reef Resort. I don't know of any dog beaches but I'm sure they (the dogs) aren't allowed on the beach until after 8pm.
rvTcDJ6yaa	Firstly flights. I like www.expedia.com (or maybe www.expedia.co.ca)<br>  but there are lots of others. You might find that its cheaper to get a flight to london and then get another flight ( even from a different airport but its not hard to get between them)..www.skyscanner.net is good for flights withing europe but also has flights elsewhere.<br>  <br>  From the CDG airport in Paris you can get the RER train, which is next to the airport and takes you to train stations ( many of which connect to the metro which is entensive). Get a travel guide for France or Paris. Its amazing how much better you feel know where you are going and how to get there and things that you want ot see and do.<br>  <br>  Accommodation varies but rooms in general in paris are small...mine was tiny! I am not sure how much you want to spend on it but the hostel websites also have cheap hotels and have ratings which is helpful. There are LOTS of accommoadation websites and you might need to have a look at a few and get an idea of prices. Take into account where you are as well as while those more central are more enxpensive its quicker and less of a hassle getting to and from it and you are often closer to other facilities.<br>  websites i know that are ok are www.hostels.com, www.hostelbookers.com, www.hostelworld.com, www.lonelyplanet.com. Others like www.hotels.com may help too.<br>  <br>  I used the metro and walking to get around paris as most things are pretty central and the metro is good to get around. I got a carte orange but i have heard this has changed now..you might have to investigate ( it gets you on say zones 1-2 for 5 days) <br>  You can also get a museum pass which gets you into a range of places but not all..i know the Lourvre is one and if you get it before (you can get them from kiosks around paris..i think i got mine on the underpass to the arc de triomphe)...you don;t have to line up for tickets at the lourvre and go straight in, which is handy ( the pre-paid line is shorter and quicker!) ..the louvre is GINORMOUS!!! I got so tired and i left and came back in the evening! I still did not do it justice.<br>  <br>  You can also do some day/night tours. There are agian lots of websites. I have used www.viator.com before and found them good. You can also look at it and see what things paris has to offer. I did the versialles half day one and found it great and i got a lot more out of it than if i would have gone by myslef as the guide was great and told us stories etc. We also had time to walk around after and did not have to queue to go in either.<br>  <br>  Things to see that I did apart from those already mentioned was eiffle tower ( queues are quite long, can get lift up to top or can walk up free part way up..reasonable views but has to be done), arc de triomphe has good views and a decent climb as is Sacre Couer ( phew tired legs).<br>  I missed the Musee dórsey as it was shut on mondays or something like that!! i did go to a picasso museum, Notre Dame is great, Sainte Chapelle is lovely ( wonderful stained glass), a boat ride along the Seine is a nice way to see it. I also went to Pare Lechaise (cemetary) where lots of famous people are buried eg jim morrison, edith piaf, oscar wilde, chopin..its free entry but you can buy a map of graves for a couple of euros. Its big but there are some amamzingly elaborate tombs with stained glass, statues etc.<br>  I came across lots of churches on my meanderings....its a good city for walking. Have fun. Do some research and be prepared and it will put your mind at ease.
lcj1AKt1aa	Come to Barbados.  It is an island in the Caribbean and just 166 sq smiles.  Note that the miles has on an 's' and that is for a reason. The people here are very friendly. Read some information here.<br>  <br>  Information on Barbados<br>  <br>  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.<br>  <br>  When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.<br>  <br>  Barbados Expectation<br>  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://barbados.org/" rel="nofollow">http://barbados.org/</a><br>  Some all-inclusive resorts here including Almond Casuarina which is very near to the night life (St. Lawrence Gap).

It was undiscovered by foreigners (locals of course knew of its existence) until 1947, when it was found by English explorer/mountaineer Eric Shipton. It was then lost to outsiders again, until 2000, when National Geographic led an expedition to 'rediscover' it, which they did.<br>  <br>  First you fly to Kashgar, then take a two-hour jeep ride with a guide, and then hike to the arch.

SQWvMx6Maa	You should go for it because I have a passion for it too! Except there's supposed to be at least one week of emergency training. That part should be the hardest. You have to be able to swim a certain distance and lift heavy objects fairly quickly. I don't know if all airlines do this but Japan Airlines has OJT training where someone watches over you and they give a report to someone who's an experienced flight attendant. The Japan Airlines training is hard because you also have to bow a certain angle for certain things etc. It depends on what airline you want to work for. But usually they start of with the basics. They teach you about the plane and about the service. After that usually it's the emergency training. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah email me if you want more information.|`|BAlYRNN8aa	My cousin is an attendant for Quantas in Australian and New Zealand, she loves it and flys all over the world.  Everyday its somewhere differant, North America, Asia, Europe!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	A woman I worked with WAS a flight attendant.  Apparantly this was NOT a good experience.  This was 15 years ago or so when she started the job, but anyways, they weighed all of them before their shift and they had to be within 5 lbs. of their target weight which was enforced by the airline.  Well...eventually the law took over and outlawed this policy but 5 years ago when she finally quit, she said things were just as bad, only they couldn't use numbers as their fight.  They instead made subtle comments and lowered her self esteem.  This woman is 5'3" and about 115 lbs.  I would consider that to be average size, if not a little small.  I wouldn't do it, no way.
sBrYcT5daa	as much as I know, there is a campus on Ramstein Air Base. I've heard about people taking classes. Don't know which college and if they offer nursing. But I can tell you this. Public college in Germany is held in German. You won't do so well, if you don't speak the language perfectly.|`|CvGEdIUiaa	I don't know about the classes they offer on base, but nursing is nothing that you will be able to study at a German university, as in Germany, nurses become nurses through apprenticeships. Depending on what school diploma you have (Hauptschulabschlu?, Realschulabschlu? or Abitur), you will take a three year or a two year apprenticeship program. That is, people apply for an apprenticeship in a hospital, and if they get the job, in the first year they go to school (Berufsschule) on several days a week, and than in the last year they only go one day a week.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know which German school diploma a High School diploma equals to, most likely a Realschulabschlu?/ mittlere Reife.<br>  Working and school language would be German, though.

The people there are very friendly, it is very safe and it has an amazing history.<br>  <br>  Damascus is the oldest continually inhabited city in the world.  Christians and Muslims have co-existed there peacefully for centuries.  It has some amazing sites such as the Umayyad mosque, which was once a temple to Jupiter, then became a Christian church and is now a mosque.  This mosque contains the head of John the Baptist and is a very important site religiously.  Damascus also has the tomb of the Muslim hero of the Crusades, Salah-ah-Din or Saladin.<br>  <br>  Syria has some incredible Roman ruins.  Palmyra is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the world.  It is in the desert and full of amazing treasures.  The old city is next to the new city which has a thriving oasis and wonderful people.<br>  <br>  What many have called the finest castle in the world is also in Syria.  Krak de Chevaliers was a Crusader castle that was extremely important during the Crusades.  It is still in wonderful shape and attracts many visitors each year.<br>  <br>  Meals in Syria are social events and very filling.  You may have mezze or starters that contain as many as twenty different dishes, followed by large mains and wonderful Arabic pastries for dessert.  Smoking a water pipe or sheesha or nargileh is a social event in Syria that is often associated with a meal.  Drinking tea and coffee is also important socially - it is an important part of sealing a business deal or showing true hospitality to a guest.<br>  <br>  Syria is a beautiful country.  Parts of the land are very fertile while there are also mountains and deserts.

Pr3QIlweaa	(First answer!  Wahoo!!)<br>  <br>  If it's moving along well (not during peak times), then it's about a half hour from St. Patrick to Finch.<br>  <br>  Where those black circles are (on the map at the link you included), that's where you can switch trains.  Personally, though, I wouldn't bother.  I'd ride the train around union station to and/or from St. Patrick.  You just stay on the train.  So if you're going from St. Patrick to Finch, you board the train at St. Patrick station going southbound.  Just stay in your seat at Union.  Then you'll be travelling north to Finch.<br>  <br>  EDIT: in order to do the Finch to St. Patrick route via the Bloor/Danforth line, you'd have to travel south to Bloor station, and change trains, going westbound on the Bloor/Danforth line.  Then you'd have to change trains again at either St. George or Spadina, going south on the Yonge/University line, to St. Patrick.  That's three trains.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, St. Patrick, Osgoode, and St. Andrew are all very close together, so the stations are fast.  The map is not to scale.  If you stay in your seat (either north or southbound) through Union station, it's usually faster than doing the three train thing.|`|i8wCVoMsaa	Not that long...<br>  you take subway from finch station, go south until your reach bloor & yonge station, and then make a transfer in the green line, get off in st.patrick. That's it... around 30mins.<br>  <br>  When you reach the intersection of the green and yellow line (if i wasn't wrong, that is just the bloor & yonge station i mentioned above), just get off in that station, and go down stair to take the green line. it'll be like 2 to 3 (i couldn't remember) stops until you reach st.partrick station.

7PMpJqiiaa	There really are not too may decent seashell collecting beaches near San Francisco, you "may" find a few on the beach going north to Fort Cronkite (Rodeo) Beach near the Marin Headlands (this is a pebbly beach, and you can also find a lot of real California jade without looking too hard), and even more going further to Drake's Beach in Drake's Bay.  Low tides are best, right after a storm.  If you are willing to drive a bit, you will find a lot of shells around Pismo (the famous "pismo clam"), Shell and Avila Beach along the California central coast area, and a VERY famous seashell dealer in Morro Bay.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to look but not take, there is a nationally-acclaimed tidepool area at Moss Beach, around Half Moon Bay.  Close by is a tour you can take to say hello to some sea otters.<br>  <a href="http://www.halfmoonbaychamber.org/visiting_hmb/ecotourism/tidepools.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.halfmoonbaychamber.org/visiti...</a>|`|AA10758468	The shoreline is predominantly state park land and in state parks collecting seashells is against the law.|`|frA6KJwIaa	there are two well known beaches, baker beach and ocean beach. finding shells though would just be a matter of luck.|`|vLp1Y1aIaa	Ya, the SF bay is not great for sea shell collecting. BUT, you can collect very beautiful "peached" glass. These are pieces of old broken bottles and the like that have rolled around the shores for years, grinding off the sharp bits and leaving them rounded and smooth. You have to go during low tide. I used to pick up much in Pinole. Remember to do this during low tide and bring rubber boots as the bay during low tide is mucky.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Best place is  the tourist gift shops. They have the best collection and often package them in affordable bundles. They are imported from China and cost far less than authentic shells from the amurican oceans. If you must go down to the seashore to pick sea shells make sure you go between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. so as to not disturb the disturbing dandies......cheers

There are tons of nice shops and restaurants on here. We got some cool things to take back with us and some presents for people back home. I recommend to eat at BJ's Restaurant. It was very yummy! <a href="http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  We also went to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unless the sky is very clear it is hard to see the mountains from Denver so I would highly recommend driving there to get a great view of the mountains.<br>  <br>  Also cool about 1 hour south of Denver in Colorado Springs is Pike's Peak. You can take a cog train up there to the top. They do this year round as well. Also in Colorado Springs is the gorgeous Garden of the Gods. I would highly recommend visiting there for a day trip from Denver.<br>  <br>  If you are into art Denver has a nice art museum. We just looked at the sculptures outside but I'm sure the inside is just as nice as well.|`|3LmXfFoBaa	ski

It can vary from  bread or rice to the one with soup in it like PH?, or noodles (white or yellow) or vermicelle. In some family whose members have the habit of eating a BIG breakfast, they would wake up early in the morning to cook and have breakfast at home (for example they would fry the rice left in the previous dinner to eat or they even cook noodles)<br>  <br>  As for our family, we have a very light breakfast with bread and butter, sometimes if my dad has time, he will fry egg for me. Normaly, I would stop by somewhere on my way to class to buy bread( the kind that they call "sandwich" in France with ham and other stuff)<br>  <br>  It is difficult to tell you what a REAL VIETNAMESE breakfast is. But well, yeah, normally there are certain people who can't do without a big PH? or a plate of RICE called C?M T?M<br>  <br>  Edit: I can treat you to a real Vietnamese breakfast if you are here. ;) Shouldn't be a problem for me ;) ;) **wink **<br>  <br>  @HANDSOME: noooooooooo! Normally, Vietnamese won't eat CONGEE or BOILED EGG in the morning. Nooo way!|`|811bea340b8deed759ed2955d3c9f0e8aa	COPY & PASTE...<br>  <br>  There are multiple breakfast menu options for Vietnam breakfast, and usually the household will buy this from vendors rather than make it. Breakfast can be quite hearty, depending on whether one chooses to top their meal with a meat roll or pastries. Typical noodle breakfast dishes in Vietnam (which are usually served with a loaf of bread to dip in the soup) include Pho (Vietnamese beef or chicken soup based rice noodle), hu tieu (egg/wheat noodles, either soup based or not, with various meat or seafood), Bún bò Hu? (spicy Hue style beef soup based noodles), Bún riêu (crab soup based vermicelli noodles) or mi quang (prawn and pork rice noodles). Banh cuon ( crêpe-like roll made from thin, wide sheets of rice flour filled with ground pork, minced wood ear mushroom, and other ingredients, including meat loaves and sauce), banh bao (savoury meat buns or sweet bean buns), banh mi (Vietnamese cold cut meat loaf breads), banh mi hot ga op la[2] (Vietnamese French Bread with Sunnyside-Up Eggs (which may be served with a hot meat ball soup)), x?i (or glutinous rice, either savoury or sweet), boiled eggs or congee (similar to the Southern Chinese), are common breakfast meals in Vietnam. Often, the Vietnamese will drink coffee, tea, juice, or soy milk to complete their breakfasts.|`|C7qkFbPxaa	im vietnamese and i would say the best thing to eat for breakfast in vietnam is some "vietnamese pizza" its like a vietnamese style omlette with shrimp and veggies with fish sauce to dip in.|`|nX9qHTWwaa	I'll offer you fresh from the tree some coconut juice and some Vietnamese sub-sandwich.|`|fHJcGAyTaa	opium ;-)|`|77202518c836c78fdbe35d5bbabb5ca4aa	An American tube steak|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	fish , rice, eggs, and a card to join the communist party|`|CYYWX0x6aa	lol o.O<br>  maybe some of your fav hometown food?<br>   <br>  hm, maybe i'll bring you, BRING, not treat, lol, to a goodlooking, 5 stars vietnamese restaurant  [:|`|CeI47C72aa	Welcome to Chez Izzy in downtown Hanoi, madamoiselle...<br>  <br>  For breakfast, you have the option of :<br>  Pho<br>  Congi (Rice soup)<br>  Pancakes<br>  or American or Continental breakfast.<br>  <br>  I regret to inform you that with the westernisation of Vietnam, the traditional "real" Vietnamese breakfast is slowly disappearing as more fast food joints pop up.<br>  <br>  As for me...I prefer Pho or Congi in the wintertime as it's piping hot and pancakes in summer.|`|axylPYftaa	rice, as usual<br>  and thai leaf|`|6TAp4PB5aa	an over sized white radish, with vinegar sauce... yum yum...|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	I'd offer u a ticket to Thailand b/c its way better, then I'd offer u rice & something so spicy ur ears would bleed & a Singha beer to chase it down =D|`|NCvX4I0baa	Take you to the street market.. which really isn't in the streets.

HElFwWXGaa	You've probably got several options. You could contact the Universities & Polytechnics in NZ that offer similar courses to yours & ask them if they know of any potential internships that might be suitable (they place their own students so they should have contacts). You mentioned Queenstown, so Otago Polytechnic would be the closest - although I don't think they're particularly known for tourism / recreation. Try searching in the main centers - Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington & Dunedin. You're best to search for the big institutions, the ones calling themselves Universities, Polytechs or Unitechs (there's a whole bunch of smaller commercial schools that probably wont help much). Check with your own teachers to see if they have contacts with their Kiwi counterparts.<br>  <br>  The Department of Conservation is another option. They do a lot of interesting work & are heavily involved in tourism / recreation - although this would be a lot of outdoors work (this would seem to be a good fit with your future plans though). I've definitely heard of foreign students working for them for short periods though.<br>  <br>  Another option is to check what US companies work in NZ, such as hotel chains. You could then approach them in the US to see if they could help you arrange something in NZ.<br>  <br>  There is always a lot of seasonal work related to tourism / recreation in NZ. You might want to check out the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree forums - it would be a good place to find out about employment in NZ from other travelers.<br>  <br>  The visa you'll need to work in NZ would be a working holiday one - which is easy enough to get for US citizens.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good luck.

VFTn5MVtaa	It all depends on what kind of vacation you want to go on.  There is Atlantic city with a roller coaster that oversees the ocean, you have Disney world and Disney land!  If you want to go sightseeing, then consider a road trip across the entire U.S. through route 66 or visit a national monument.  Try the Abraham Lincoln memorial in Washington D.C, or a tour of the White House, follow the route of the march that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led in Washington D.C.  There's Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota!  You can also visit the lodge in which Abraham Lincoln grew up and self taught to become a lawyer in Springfield, ILL.<br>  Try the petrified forest in Arizona or Mt. Charleston in Nevada from which you can view many other mountains and take a peek at the lands used by the government to test their nuclear bombs many years ago.  There's Niagara Falls in New York.  It all depends where you want to go and what you want to do with your vacation!  Good luck and I hope you have lots of fun!

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	The only way to get a green card is to apply to immigrate permanently, and be accepted...and it takes years.   The only way you can immigrate is if you have an immediate family member to sponsor you or have tons of money to immigrate as an investor, or have a REALLY rare and in-demand job skill.  If none of those apply to you there is one other way...the Diversity Lottery Program.  You must sign up for the lottery 2 yrs. in advance, then 50,000 of the nearly 10 million who apply every year are chosen.  Immigration takes years and is very complicated.   To get a  temp. work visa ( the only kind there is) you must be highly skilled, super lucky, find an employer to give you a contract...then the employer applies for the visa for you.  Getting a green card in the U.S. nearly impossible.  There are all kinds of green card scams and immigration consultants  who rip people off..so only get your info from the state dept website.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	My Uncle applied in 1998.<br>  <br>  Got a workers visa in the meantime.<br>  <br>  And he got his green card in 2007.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	I don't think you can get a green card unless you've actually lived here a few years.

Lx6TXgHKaa	Which moves are you referring to? There are many moves whose consequences do not remain restricted to China or for that matter any country. <br>  <br>  If China explodes a satellite in space as an experiment it is making lot of future satellite trajectories un-viable and creating debris and the world community has a right to object.<br>  <br>  If they support a rogue nation like Sudan which was killing its own citizens against the sentiments of the world bodies, people are justified in taking interest and objecting to the move.<br>  <br>  If China produces tainted products like melamine stained milk and toys with lead content that kill/mime the consumer, we have a right to take interest in the affairs and object.<br>  <br>  If China abuses human rights, we very well have a right to say them to stop and mend their ways.<br>  <br>  When they manipulate their currencies to take undue advantage, we have the right to object.<br>  <br>  Well my list can go on.<br>  <br>  In general, people take interest when they don't understand and suspect the intentions of the Communist party.

The world has never been the same after the second world war. People everywhere have realized that human rights abuses and suppression of people have the potential to be amplified into a major war and everyone has a concern to that. This concern is not restricted to geographic boundaries.|`|82tgfHzqaa	Because China is a huge power, now. It's the same with America or Russia. When these countries move, even a little, it sends shock waves throughout the world.<br>  <br>  Just 20 years ago nobody cared what China did because it was still trying to rebuild itself after the disastrous reign of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping shocked the world with his decision to massacre the thousands of protesters in Tienanmen Square in front of international cameras. Since then, the rest of the world has seen China as barbaric, totalitarian, and scary. Of course, we are not scared of what China might do to us, because the Western world could easily defeat China in a military conflict, but we are scared that such a cruel government is so big and powerful.<br>  <br>  I love China and Chinese people, but I hate the Chinese government.|`|Tz2D0grWaa	simply put<br>  <br>  people don't understand China|`|45P4NU47aa	Pretty much the US.

fuxx93P8aa	here is a recipe and directions <br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS FOR BEEF FILLING:<br>  <br>  2 lbs ground beef <br>  1/2 teaspoon Accent <br>  8 sprigs of thyme <br>  2 ozs escallion <br>  2 small hot peppers <br>  1 teaspoon paprika <br>  half a loaf french bread <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  <br>  <br>  METHOD:<br>  <br>  Grind escallion and hot peppers in a mincing mill. <br>  Add to ground beef with salt. <br>  Place meat in a saucepan making a well in the center into which place 4 sprigs of thyme. <br>  Cook without adding any water or fat until meat has lost its broth and only certain amount of oil remains. <br>  Pour off excess oil and add this to the paprika to be used later on, strained for coloring meat. <br>  While meat is being cooked, pour sufficient cold water over bread in a saucepan to cover and soak for a few minutes, then squeeze dry, saving water. <br>  Pass bread through mincing mill and return the ground bread water with 4 sprigs of thyme and cook until bread is dry. <br>  Combine meat and cooked bread. <br>  Add color, paprika in sufficient quantity to color the meat to taste. <br>  Cook together for a further 20 mins. <br>  Add Accent . Remove from fire. Cool for filling pastry circles. <br>  INGREDIENTS FOR PASTRY: <br>  11 ozs suet (beef fat or shortening) <br>  4 cups flour <br>  1 level teaspoon salt <br>  2/3 cup iced water <br>  <br>  <br>  METHOD:<br>  <br>  Trim all skin and fatty membrane from suet and set overnight in freezer. <br>  Next day, with a very sharp knife shave suet as finely as possible. <br>  Combine salt and flour, then work in suet as you would shortening in plain pastry, cutting it in with two knives. <br>  Add iced water in sufficient amount to have a dough which can be rolled out. <br>  Form into a ball and with a rolling pin, pat gently, turning the dough over once or twice in order to have it all properly held together. <br>  Set overnight wrapped in wax paper in freezer. <br>  Next day, pull off enough dough (after defrosting) to roll into a circle the size of a breakfast saucer. <br>  Dip dough in flour before rolling. <br>  Roll quite thin and cut in a circle. (use saucer for help) In the center of each circle place a spoonful of meat, fold dough over to form a crescent shape seal edges with egg white or by crimping the edge and folding dough slightly under. <br>  Do not prick the pastry. <br>  Bake on ungreased tin sheet in a hot oven for about 35 mins. <br>  This recipe will make about 3 dozen regular patties. if cocktail patties are needed, use a smaller cutter than a saucer. <br>  Serving 3 dozen regular size patties.Try different fillings for experiment|`|oTuMMYJoaa	Check out <a href="http://www.jamaicatravelandculture.com/food_and_drink/patties.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamaicatravelandculture.com/f...</a> <br>  There is a fab recipe with step by step pics... good luck!!
NK3VJgiRaa	Philly is a great city with good colleges. Of course Philly also has a  bad side. North & West Philly are the worst areas (I live in North). South Philly isnt so bad, it has some bad parts, but some parts are good. Southwest Philly is bad though. Center city is nice but expensive. Northeast Philly is good & not so expensive. Manyunk & Roxborough are good, lots of young people. Philly has a lot of nightlife. Mostly in Center City. Manyunk has some good nightlife too. Look into some of the areas I mentioned as being good & see what you think.

AA11081540	Don't go to Amigo hostel in Budapest. Their location is great but the rooms are terrible! Our room (called a "private, en suite room) didn't even have windows!!!

The furniture looked old and rusty, and the bathroom was unbelievably small.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Just about any cheap hostel in Amsterdam is a nightmare... get a separate room, stay in a suburb and take the quick transit in, or spring for a cheap hotel/guesthouse, unless your idea of fun is a disgusting mess everywhere crammed with loud, wasted people throwing up. <br>  <br>  There's some pretty sketchy hostels in Crete and Sarajevo. Read advice in your Lonely Planet (DON"T take 'Let's Go') and read reviews on websites like Tripadvisor, Hostelworld, and Gomio for the cities you're going to.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	I ended up only staying in one that I had read that had mixed reviews but in general seemed great.

Next go to top of the light house and use the lobster it will turn the light around and scare the bird away. Now go on the boat and race Nate to the island. once you beat him you will see paper push the two top seals to the left all the way and get the paper. it is the map of where the time capsule is! Ok now go to the playground and go inside the house at the top. play hangman (the answers changes if you quit) and get peanut crackers from Nate.

Go to the playground and put the crackers where the girls were talking. the dog will dig a hole and the capsule is there open it and then read and then you get the medal !!!!!!!!!
Pr3QIlweaa	(First answer!  Wahoo!!)<br>  <br>  If it's moving along well (not during peak times), then it's about a half hour from St. Patrick to Finch.<br>  <br>  Where those black circles are (on the map at the link you included), that's where you can switch trains. Personally, though, I wouldn't bother. I'd ride the train around union station to and/or from St. Patrick. You just stay on the train. So if you're going from St. Patrick to Finch, you board the train at St. Patrick station going southbound. Just stay in your seat at Union. Then you'll be travelling north to Finch.

The jobs are diverse, the economy sucks. Which is too bad because there are a LOT of talented people in Colombia.

It will make it much easier for you to interview, plus it makes companies much more eager to give you face time if you have a local address.  Sometimes the out-of-state address on a resume or application makes them cringe about relocation costs; with everyone cutting back these days, the distance could put a crimp in your search.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3ExqLHejaa	haha.. ky? lol

I tried to post my answer many times and had to save it until Yahoo had resolved the problem.<br>  <br>  France has an advantageous situation in that it has a long coast line all along its western side and, since it is hexagon shaped, it also has borders with several other European countries namely Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland , Italy, Spain, Andorra .It  has two coastlines, one with the Atlantic ocean in the west and another with the Mediterranean sea in the south-east, which enables it to trade easily with many countries.<br>  It has two ranges of high mountains: the Alps that separate it from Italy in the south-eastern area, and the Pyrénées between it and Spain. It also has lesser ex-volcanic ranges : the Massif Central, the  Ardennes, the Vosges and the Jura .<br>  It is well irrigated with several large rivers that have many tributaries: The Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rh?ne, the Rhine ( a natural frontier with Germany in Alsace) and the Escault (in Flanders, that continues north into Belgium). <br>  It has several plains (Flanders; Beauce and Brie where wheat is grown) and its geology is such that it also has areas with natural caves where produce like wine and cheese are matured. Some of the caves in Périgord have paintings and marks of prehistoric man ( Cro Magnon) .The Landes area next to the Atlantic coast in the south- east is flat, marshy and densely forrested.<br>  These are the main facts but if you search the net for "Geography of France" or type in the names that I have given you, you will find more detailed information for your report.<br>  Here are maps:<br>  <a href="http://www.voyagesphotosmanu.com/pages/page_260pag.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.voyagesphotosmanu.com/pages/p...</a><br>  <a href="http://bonjourlafrance.net/france-map/map-of-france.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bonjourlafrance.net/france-map/ma...</a>|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	lol, you want us to do your homework huh??<br>  <br>  Well, you've got the Alps mountains on the east, then the Pyrénées mountains on the south between France and Spain, many dead volcanoes in Auvergnes|`|A1S4X0DJaa	Eiffel Tower en Paris x

I believe it has been tried.  <br>  <br>  LOOOOOOOTs of boat people have been illegally entering Spain in recent years because of this, and there are two cities that are Spanish but are actually IN Morocco.  Still.  There were several colonies that belonged to Spain in Northern Africa, but they are now independent, and there has been trade between the two entities since....forever.  <br>  <br>  Check out the history of the Moors in Spain...they were there BECAUSE of the proximity of Spain to the already conquered area of Morocco. <br>  <br>  And, as for what to see...well, maybe just searching "tourism in Spain" would give you that.  There is soooooo much!|`|v2eAwuYkaa	Ceuta y Melilla, the two cities in Morocco, were from spain before Morocco even existed, so they can't reclaim them because they've never have them.

AA10740352	If you want to get paid for your work, YES!!! <br>  <br>  People who work selling cruises MUST be certified travel professionals.  In the US you need to first either attend travel school or work for a period of time for an authorized travel agency. In the travel business there is an agency  called ARC (= Airline Reporting Corporation) which controls all of the distribution of travel funds and you must be a member in order to participate. You gain that participation by schooling and work in the business. Then you need to join a travel association, like ASTA or CLIA, which show you are a professional travel person.<br>  <br>  You should look into attending a travel school like maybe Carlson Travel. There are several others that are nationwide (see web site below). I attended Carlson and they offer full time and part-time classes. Once you finish the school, they will help you with placement, finding a job. You really need to work in the business under an agency for a while to learn how things are done. Once you finish schooling and or your apprenticeship, you are assigned a CLIA or ASTA number. That number is your ticket to getting paid. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to work on land for  any, cruise line then you need to contact the cruise lines directly. They have positions located in various places around the US that handle telephone reservations and questions for people who want to cruise. They also hire people on a part time basis to work at the ports on the days and times that cruise ships are there.|`|X6rFPI2laa	The cruise lines will only deal directly with those people they recognize as professional travel agents or with passengers.  Of course, you can always help friends and family through the booking process with advice.|`|CVZsMmPDaa	world tour<br>  <a href="http://worldstour.info/" rel="nofollow">http://worldstour.info/</a>

I would go back in a heartbeat!  My husband and I went on our own and did just fine with having read ahead on how to get around.  The bus/rail/subway system will get you everywhere you want to go or within a couple of blocks at least.  Taxis are plentiful as well but not nearly as economical.    We were there a week in June and got in most of the highlights.  Did not go on the London Eye which has mixed reviews.  If you want to email me that is fine.  I would be glad to share my experience.  I have travelled throughout England, Scotland, and some in Germany.|`|ml6o7Gklaa	hey what I do is if your trying not to spend too much money is by going to free TV recordings. I have been to see The Charlotte Church Show, The Sunday night project, paul o'grady, loose women, mitchell and webb, it is so good as it is a great night out. Also the TV show Sound you can get tickets for and a music guest is on every week, great for anyone who likes indie music.

mDDUsNG9aa	I spent the better part of 30 years in New Jersey and I can tell you for sure that it is getting very expensive to live. People will tell you that it's cheaper then NYC which in some area's of the State are in fact cheaper, rents are cheaper but your taxes and if you own your property tax are very very high some area's as much as 10, 000.00! <br>  <br>  There is something for everyone in New Jersey..the shore (the beach for you non natives) is about the best place in NJ from Sandy Hook down to Cape May..Which you can take a ferry from Cape May to Delaware for shopping..Then of course there is Atlantic City ( two blocks from the boardwalk in any direction your taking your life in your hands tough city)...Hoboken and the shore are the places for clubs bars and and night life...Newark and New Brunswick have the theaters for the arts, Newark also is home to the Devils (Hockey) Performing Arts Center, Iron Bound District great restaurants.... (again in Newark a few blocks in any direction taking your life in your own hands) There is Great Adventure in Jackson. State Parks for outdoor recreation and camping...Close to NYC and Philly ( yes the cheese steaks are worth the ride into Philly) Camden another tough city worse then Newark Atlantic City is home to the Battleship New Jersey and the Aquarium..Famous Jersey Corn and Tomatoes are great (seasonal of course) Baseball expansion teams and indepent leauges have staidums all over the state cheap family fun and also not a bad seat in the house ie Somerset Patriots, Atlantic City Surf, Lakewood Blue Claws, Trenton Thunder, Sussex Sky Hawks...The natives are good people and no we don't have accents you do (LOL) some have attitudes some dont, driving in NJ is an experience don't be a left lane dick and you will be fine ( dont drive slow in the left lane)..Best thing for you is to look around take a vacation to NJ come to the shore (LBI my favorite) see for yourself drive all over check it out...If I could still afford to live in NJ i think I would still be there or in Brooklyn NY!!|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	cheaper than nyc thats for sure. you need a car. if you ask me driving down the turnpike jersey looks like and smells like a dump|`|AA12059972	If you like the outdoors and plan on living in New Jersey this website may be worth checking out - <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newjerseyscenic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newjerseyscenic.com</a>|`|YOTIM5Caaa	Weather-<br>  It's pretty cold from mid November to about mid March. It snows once in a while between December and February. It starts getting warmer through march and april, and may is when the temperature really gets warm and all the trees have leaves. From most of May to September the weather is warm, and can even get near 100 degrees some days. Then in October it starts to get colder again.<br>  <br>  We don't usually have really bad weather, but once in a while a bad snow storm hits or a big rainstorm comes.<br>  <br>  Music and Arts- It's true, a lot of big names have come from the NJ area, but not everyone gets big. There are a lot of venues all around to have shows, and since it's close to NY, there are tons of major concerts and music festivals that even take lesser known artists from around the area. I've seen a lot of bands get famous after concerts like Bamboozle (literally going from nothing to being played on vh1 and mtv just a few weeks later)<br>  <br>  Areas to live- If you want to live near a city, northern NJ is good because of it's location near NYC, and parts of southern NJ are close to philly. As for prices of a place to live, it really depends on the town. Where I live, you have homes that are well over 1,000,000 dollars, and you go to the town over and homes are 650,000. Generally speaking though, most of the northern counties are more expensive to live in. You really have to do your own research on it because the price varies to greatly throughout NJ.<br>  <br>  Public Transportation- Where I live, there are many large bus stations and park & rides. Trains are available too. In some more urbanized areas, taxis are available, but won't take you too far.<br>  <br>  People- Oh man, it's hard to describe. Yes, we have the stereotypical trashy people, but there are actually a lot of normal people here. People in most areas are generally wealthy, and work A LOT. Some people can be rude, but just be nice and have a positive attitude and you'll be fine. Of course, this is from a point of view of a new jersey native, so I can't exactly tell you about what we're like.<br>  <br>  hope I helped!|`|cd8f85b7b6920f19a7c15d03f118699aaa	there are tons of different areas of new jersey- probably something for everyone.<br>  <br>  you can live in the mountains in a secluded area, live by the beach, live in a city, live in the suburbs. it depends on what you're looking for!<br>  <br>  if you're young and interested in music and arts, red bank, new brunswick and hoboken are cool towns to check out, but rent is probably pricier than if you live in towns that don't have easy access to entertainment or public transportation. there are buses and trains to pretty much everywhere in central/northern new jersey (njtransit.com), but i've never relied solely on public transportation. southern new jersey is less expensive, but things are spread further apart and you'd definitely need a car to get around. <br>  <br>  if you live closer to new york city you can get into manhattan pretty quickly at a low cost, so that's always fun.<br>  <br>  the population of nj is quite diverse, which in my opinion is a great benefit. people are nice i guess, but there's definitely a level of sass/sarcasm that you just can't find too far outside of the tri-state area. <br>  <br>  depending on where you're coming from, the weather can be good or bad. we definitely get the full range of seasons here. my favorite months are may through september, but i tend to prefer a warm/hot climate.<br>  <br>  in short, nj is awesome. don't let anyone tell you otherwise. terribly convenient, tons of exciting things to do, beautiful scenery and a ton of culture/history. <br>  <br>  if you have any more specific questions just ask!|`|QX2xnrhWaa	Never lived there, but a coworker did (in North Bergen) and loved it.

Go out in the garage, climb up into the attic and get out all the seldom used camping equipment.  Then, after you have removed all the camping stuff, take into the living room and set up the tent with your sleeping bags, etc.  You may have to go outside to find enough rocks to build your fire pit, but place it near the tent so you will not get cold during the night.  Go to your local convenience store and pick up enough wood to last through the night.  Then return home, turn your air conditioner down to 60 degrees.  When your husband comes home, you can have a nice roaring fire going, with a cup of hot chocolate and only wearing a smile.  It will be the best at home vacation ever.

Excellent. <br>  <br>  You see, these machines are not only the engine of the globalized, capitalist world but they also depend on technologies that have been produced by Israeli academics in the Zionist entity. <br>  <br>  Stop playing with your detached mouse,  and concentrate.

VxfyQZ2jaa	I would probably stay at the Omni Royal Orleans or the Hotel Le Richelieu, which aren't that expensive but are nice hotels and are in great locations (depending on what you want).    The language in general use in New Orleans is English, but there are some Francophone-oriented events:    http://www.consulfrance-nouvelleorleans....    Residents tend to patronize the same attractions as tourists, except for Bourbon Street.     Things to do in New Orleans:    Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals    The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com    There is always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music.     Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.    An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com    About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They dont necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.    Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).    Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park).     The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com    Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  http://www.louisianataxfree.com/    The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).    Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry.     The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.    Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.    All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com    Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi). They are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays (504-945-5635).    The Napoleon House restaurant is at 500 Chartres Street in the FQ, and has a menu of great local dishes:  www.napoleonhouse.com    Preservation Hall has traditional live Jazz, and doesnt serve alcohol so all ages are welcome:  www.preservationhall.com    New Orleans has ballet, opera, a symphony orchestra, and theatre:     www.nobadance.com  www.neworleansopera.org  www.lpomusic.com  www.lepetittheatre.com    There is a free ferry across the Mississippi at the "foot" of Canal Street. It is a short trip but like a harbor cruise w/o a guide: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_stree...    The Aquarium, Audubon Zoo, and the new Insectarium are world-class attractions (www.auduboninstitute.org) and you should see them if you can. The Zoo is several miles from downtown. You can drive to the Zoo (which has free parking) or take public transit from the French Quarter.    The Louisiana State Museum is in the French Quarter:  http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/  New Orleans is also home to a number of other museums, such as the Natio|`|fJwA4ngMaa	It is hard because you did not specify your age or interests.  I would definitely take my 21 year old cousin to different spots than I would my 50 year old aunt. Or take my girlfriend with kids to different museums than my best friend who is an artist.  But New Orleans has so, so much to offer.   I agree that Richelieu is one of the best hotels in the city.  It is where many of my friends have stayed, but honestly, who goes to New Orleans and hangs out in the hotel the whole time.    As far as food, Mother's and Parasol's are my two faves for po-boys, at east that are still in biz.  Clancy's and Galatoire's are two of the best fine dining places in the whole city, in my opinion.  These are all places that are well written up, but also all of them are frequented by locals too.   Mosca's is a restaurant just outside New Orleans in Avondale, La.  It is a FAVE of locals.  It, in true Louisiana fashion, does NOT take reservations, and sometimes out of towners don't like this, but it truly is a fave.  It is not necessarily the easiest to get to, you need a car, and it is still out of the way.  But if you are willing to put up with the laid back, no hurry, attitude that makes this part of the world so unique, I can guarantee delicious food and some fun people watching of New Orleanian characters.  I also think that everyone should check out the live music scene.  Maple Leaf, D.B.A.s, Vaughn's, Les Bon Temp, are all great places to catch authentic New Orleans live music.  Tipitina's uptown, however is THE place to go see music, again in my opinion.  It is smokey and often crowded and not much has changed in 30 years, but it is a true NEW ORLEANS experience, more so than anything else.    New Orleans doesn't really speak French anymore except behind the closed doors of local families and in some kitchens.  However in places like Lafayette and other small surrounding towns of Louisiana a dialect based on French is still spoken amongst the natives.

LW0rZB94aa	That's funny:)<br>  <br>  Yes, some folks in Minnesota do talk a little funny, yah knowww?  But not as much as you see on TV.  Mostly older folks who's parents or grandparents immigrated from Norway, Sweden and similar...  Lots of farmers.   It's what we called the Ole and Lena dialect.   We heard endless Ole and Lena jokes growing up, and you can't tell one without the goofy accent.<br>  <br>  I live in a small town in the country, and yes we have our share of hicks, and some may be described as thick.

162da01a5ff17359a07ed6c8b2fcec55aa	Where are you going in Florida? Orlando/Miami?   Florida is mild year-round all over and warm year-round in the southern parts near the keys/Miami/etc. The further south you will be there, the more summer-y you should dress: shorts, tanks, tees, dresses, etc. The further up in the state, the warmer you should dress: long pants, long sleeve tees, a light jacket, etc.   If you are going to Disney, I would recommend long pants but t-shirt and a light jacket for when it is cool in the mornings. It will probably be warm enough by mid-day to take the jacket off and tie around your waist or something. This is based off when I went to Disney in the beginning of March once. It was warm but we needed jackets in the morning. I would also pack lots of sunscreen and a water bottle you can refill in water fountains (like a nalgene).   However, make sure to check the weather forecast about 3 days before you leave so you can make adjustments if there is a random cold front moving through or expected rain. You should be prepared for a shower at any rate.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	kinda chilli......,....a coat and drinking money  oh a sense of humor  should be warmer next week though.... glasses,swimsuit,drinking money|`|bf3712e74618df8b6e6ad5528960f4b2aa	The weather should be warm... as far as clothing you should bring maybe  three capris .... three pants... 7 short sleeved shirts.... and one or two zip up jackets or sweatshirts... the weather there should be really nice about now... although you can bring shorts i wouldnt bring that many if i were you because im sure it can still get chilly there at night....

TbiSBXclaa	The rows at the Fox Theater are alphabetical, not numeric.  They start at A and end at RR on the main floor. Same with the balcony only not as large.<br>  <br>  There are 5 sections of seats on the main floor.  Right, Right Center, Center, Left Center and Left.<br>  <br>  Check your tickets again. You may be looking at your seat number, not the row. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question. There are no bad seats at the Fox. It's a fabulous theater with excellent sight lines to the stage.  It is a very large theater so for movie watching it may not be a great seat if you are way in the back. By purchasing your tickets this early I'm sure you have very good seats.|`|AA12068233	Those should be quite good seats. I mean, you can see well from pretty much anywhere in the theater. My only complaint is that the rows are placed to close to one another so you can’t stretch your legs out. In addition, you’ll trip over people if you have to get up to go to the bathroom or grab a drink in the middle of the show because it’s so dark.<br>  <br>  Very nice venue, though. I’ve seen several movies and plays there.

Sure winter is cold but it's not always snowing.<br>  <br>  2) My brother is going over with the Canadian Armed forces next month. And while I would rather him not going over there I know him and the rest of the boys are well trained to do what they're being sent to do. To be totally honest I'm more worried that my brother will be shot or bombed by American troops than any insurgents. There has been a few too many friendly fire accidents since the whole Afghanistan conflict started for my liking.|`|Twzg9s0caa	Canada is leaving Afghanistan in 2011, that's ten years after 9/11.<br>  When is the last time that America had soldiers fighting and dying for Canada for ten years? Never, right? <br>  I know not all Americans are as ignorant as their media (especially fox) but I have to say the views don't really doesn't offend me because I know the truth and I feel sorry for some of these delusional reporters that are so wrapped up in "spin" they can't see the truth.<br>  Obama is a good guy and I think he will help mend hard feelings between the two countries.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	Who cares what they think,they still think they live in the greatest country on earth<br>  LMAO   so ignorant|`|2wyDALHgaa	Just to clarify a few things that some of my less informed countrymen have stated:<br>  <br>  1)  Canadians are not dying in Iraq.  I'm hoping he misspoke and is not just plain, well...anyway.  It's Afghanistan they are fighting and in some tragic cases dying in.  We've made some wonderful strides there and done some outstanding work.  With lots more work to go and, with a reinvigorated outlook by the Americans towards Afghanistan, we have a real possibility to make a lasting difference there.  I've been once and I'm "on deck" to go again.<br>  <br>  2)  Canada is not going to be leaving Afghanistan in 2011.  The current mandate from the Govt calls for our focus to shift at that time away from combat operations however the Govt has stated on many occasions that we will still be there, just in another capacity.  I really can't see it making a difference in deaths however since the majority of the deaths we have suffered have not been from direct combat operations but from road side bombs which can strike whether we are undertaking combat operations or driving to a location to dig wells and train local troops.  <br>  <br>  As for American stereotypes about Canadians...I've got more important things to worry about.  Canadians have their own stereotypes about Americans and other countries have the same things with their neighbors and allies too.|`|v0ZmMbLOaa	I personally hate these stereotypes. They give such a negative outlook on Canada.<br>  <br>  1) It's not cold all year! It's not like when you cross the border, it suddenly freezes. Nuh-uh. Doesn't work that way. We have summers that are similar to America, and the same winters as the northern states (Washington, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, New York etc.)<br>  <br>  2) We don't depend on the US for protection. Ever notice that the Canadians are the ones dying in Iraq? I know Americans are too, butI hear a lot more about Canadian deaths on International News. We have an army, full of very smart troops. We just don't think that violence is the solution to anything. We peacekeep, not fight to the death of a nation.<br>  <br>  It bothers us a lot. How the American media gives such false news. It's horrible.|`|vRFiRqnpaa	I am French Canadian, and to answer your questions. It is snowy ant times up in Canada, but that does not mean it is all the time. When its Winter we can get close to 5 feet of snow. When its summer its not the heat you want to worry about its the mosquitoes and horse flies you want to worry about. <br>  <br>  To your second question I do not see where you ever heard this from. It's not that we are war prone, we choose not to start conflicts. We are basically a freelanced country, carefree. I'm sure if other Canadians saw this they might feel a little upset. It does not phase me to tell you the truth.

hOf38vgpaa	Palestinians may attack because of:<br>  <br>  1. Jealousy, since Israeli are wealthy & educated people from European countries, who generate research and Development for the world to use. <br>  <br>  2. Fear that their children will loose their religious, cultural and linguistic identity and become influenced by western values of the politically and economically more powerful Israelis.<br>  <br>  3. Israelis want to build a Temple where the Muslim Palestinians have had a Mosque for 1,500 years.<br>  <br>  4. Frustration with lack of opportunities for themselves or their children because they do not belong to the religion of the ruling Israelis.<br>  <br>  5. Constant humiliation at check points because of an ethnic (Arab) profile.<br>  <br>  6. Confiscation/ losing land/ property to new Israeli settlement<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Israelis may attack because:<br>  <br>  1. To compel Palestinians to leave, because if there are too many Arabs, then Israelis could lose political control under the rules of a democracy.<br>  <br>  2. Fear of being mistreated as a minority if Muslims became the  majority in the country.<br>  <br>  3. Make Palestinians vacate land for Israeli settlements. <br>  <br>  4. Make Palestinians vacate Temple Mount so the Jews could build their temple on that site.<br>  <br>  5. Fear that if the US loses the financial ability or political will to support Israel, it may become difficult for Israelis to remove the Palestinians later.<br>  <br>  6. Frustration with Palestinian anarchy.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  Peace plan is mainly they have to drop their violence (they do it or we make them do it) and international opinion has to stop focusing on the Arab-Israeli war and instead focus on what's going on their own backyards.  The West is making matters so much worse and it's fueled by immigrant Muslims in the West "posing as friendlies" influencing opinions in West.<br>  <br>  I blame Syria and Iran to use Palestinians as puppets so that is why Palestinians attack Israel to sacrifice them all for a greater cause. Hamas just does what Damascus tells them to do. They are extremists with this end times violent prophetic belief called Mahdi Army they want to create chaos all over the middle east then do simultaneous explosion in europe and the rest of the west. they already have mass populace in west that didn't assimilate just waiting for the blow up and half of europe already recognizes they're screwed while the other half is stupidly mesmerized by the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to even pay attention what happens in their own backyards.<br>  <br>  Everyone that has studied history knows Syria invented PLO to regain its former Greater Syrian Empire just like Saddam was doing with Kuwait and Mesopotamia. Greater Syrian Empire = Jordan, Lebanon with Israel being split off by the ancient Romans, never claimed or utilized until Israel started building skyscrapers out of sand dunes. So Syrian wants this land grab and Iran will go for the chaos it creates to make their own move on other nations and together they can rule the world it's total bloodletting and chaos what they have planned.<br>  <br>  After Arabs lost the first wars on fledgling Israel Syria sicked the PLO on Jordan, lost in bloody black september Jordan battle when used Jordanian soldier's head for soccer practice, tried to assassinate King Hussein. and operated as a state within a state trying to overtake the gov't so then got kicked out to Lebanon.<br>  <br>  then Arafat made way to Lebanon and cause civil war when he said the road to Palestine leads thru Jonieh. He ended up getting booted from there as well so then Damascus (Syria) put Hezbollah in their place.  Hezbollah is doing take over from within same mode operand the extremists all operate same way.  They destroy society then rebuild in their own name and credit.  Hezbollah demolishes christian homes in south to wage war on israel so while everyone supports that move they are distracted from takeover from within (except the christians who migrated to west/massacred they know whats up) and the Jews know whats up as everyone is so preoccupied with Israel they don't see what muslims are doing and stopping it as one has to think like an arab not a westerner to understand.  So PLO did same thing in West Bank (Judea Samaria) they kicked out Jews in 48-67 and then the christians ended up migrating/bullied out so they claim more land.  West keeps wanting to appease them so they try to give gaza for peace and build society for them there.  It took Hamas what 6 months and they did the bloody takeover they seized all gov't buildings all social service programs all tv news radio stations they were brutal and fatah was brutal right back.  there is no #3 group just lots of little ones that are just as corrupt and violent as the first 2. So that is basically what is happening why Palestinians want to attack Israel.<br>  <br>  The particular "defect" in Islam is that extremists have this necrophiliac death wish like little lemmings they jump one after another off the cliff (it's true!) of suicidal/homicidal mania for reasons they attack Israel and each other..they want to go to Paradise. There are so many things in extremist Islam that are taboo that this life is no longer good for them only Paradise when they die is the best.

4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	I just upped and moved to London when I was 24.  It was the best decision I ever made although people said I was crazy.  I left a job, a flat and a boyfriend in Aberdeen and just needed to try it.  I knew that if it didn't work out I could always come back and stay with my mum until I got myself sorted out so I had a fallback plan.  I made sure I had enough money to pay for 2 months rent and living expenses in case I didn't find a job straight away.  I went there with ￡4,000 to begin with.  Most London flats will ask for 1 months deposit as well as the first month's payment.  Flats will range from ￡1000 a month for a 2 bed within an hour's commute of the centre to ￡350 a month for a room in a shared house.  I was lucky and found a job within a week of arriving in London but I am an office manager so I can work in any industry.  I would imagine if you are skilled at office work or management it would be the most ideal as you will get paid ￡19,000 to ￡32,000 a year in London.  If you work in a shop, bar or restaurant you are likely to only get minimum wage which is not enough to live on in London unless you live with your parents or have a partner to help support you.<br>  <br>  London is great if you have money but very very miserable if you don't have any.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	it wouldn't be any better if you moved to london,london is tough,you have to be strong and live on hope you will come across people who will always look to gain an advantage from you be it your person or your money,you will come across empty promises and disappointments as for living accommodations  believe me you don't have a decent job you won't get even get a squalled bedsit you will be living rough,yes move to london but what i'm saying is plan your move take your time and work towards it,bedfordshire is not too far from london anyway so come down at weekends enjoy the nite life with your friends and maybe find yourself a really nice guy who's got a good job and shack up with him|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	yeahh definitely London rocks! and yes there are sume expensive things but also cheap things just like anywear els!<br>  <br>  and london is a beautiful and quite safe fun place to live!!!<br>  <br>  by the way,, were do u live now? =)<br>  <br>  also I'm a full time student with no work, and I can afford it !|`|oEOJ18DNaa	Go for it.!

And even better when the summer comes you can take it off due to the heat and your hand usually swells  or you can go to a jewelery store. you will pay a little  bit more and it will take at least 2weeks. so hope this was somewhat helpful and good luck...|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Uhh...there is the Wedding Ring Shop and it's on Kapiolani Blvd. Not sure if they do things like resizing in a day, but it's worth a try.

And, when you visit the Riverwalk, it's still not that far away.|`|wcgm8Z4uaa	the Omni and the Sheraton are some nice ones.|`|BMkVOR0caa	There are several good, but expensive hotels on the Riverwalk.  You have the Marriott Rivercenter, the Hyatt Regency, Crowne Plaza Hotel, just to name a few.  Great location, but expensive, average price $250 a night.  Another great hotel is the Crockett Hotel which is right behind the Alamo and is a short 3 minute walk to the Riverwalk.  It is a nice hotel, I have stayed there before.  Also a great hotel and not that expensive is the Marriott Plaza hotel located near the Tower of the Americas.  I have also stayed there and is very nice.  Also a short walk to the Riverwalk and the Alamo.<br>  <br>  Check out : <a href="http://www.riverwalk-hotels.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.riverwalk-hotels.com/</a>

RfxyVIh4aa	I've never been afraid of flying.  If you look at the statistics of how many flights there are just in this country in a single year and compare it to the number of planes that actually crash, it's pretty clear that flying isn't a dangerous mode of transportion.  (Unless you eat the in-flight meals.  Eegads.  Those things are awful!)|`|AA10415600	nope, it's never bothered me.  even the second time i flew  when a duck flew into the left engine during takeoff from Germany.  it's still safer than you would be in a car|`|FCRX9MJMaa	Flying is actually the safest way to travel. I'm perfectly fine with flying. I've flown around a dozen times before.|`|RSKtvpflaa	I do get nervous but I will fly.  The last time I flew my husband and I got seats several rows from each other.  It was quite bumpy at the beginning and I think the woman beside me thought I was going to lose it.  Once it was smooth I was fine. I absolutely hate take off....I don't know why. <br>  You're more apt to get in a car accident than a plane crash .  I would love to take a flight to Florida or a nice exotic Island right now....but....no money!|`|BAlYRNN8aa	I love flying and everything about it!! take off and landings are the most fun!!

I'm not scared of crashing though.  My fear is just not being in control...being stuck in that small plane for hours.  It's a mind thing.  But yeah they say riding in a car is way more dangerous than flying....well at least that more people die from that.|`|JjUBlGWmaa	more likely to crash in a car actually.... I have a prob with heights but Im fine in a plane, sometimes a little motion sickness or whatever, but thats from the turbulence|`|BwL4lv8uaa	i personally just dont like the heights...but its just as dangerous as everything else right?

If you're only going TO Calgary, you ONLY go to Canadian customs, so from the strictest interpretation of the wording of your question, then no, you don't have to pass through BOTH countries' immigration.  However, if you plan on coming back to the US, then you must pass through US Customs when you return to the US.<br>  <br>  In short, yes, you must pass through customs; they're at all crossings.

0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	I went to Olu Deniz last year - went to Dalaman airport - its about 1 - 1 1/2hours from resort|`|5cdd6130c673155f9bf373c7d5d929ccaa	There are several international airports which are near Olu deniz.  Dalaman Airport - 54 km (45 minutes drive)   Antalya Airport - 240 km (2 and1/2 hours drive)  Bodrum Airport - 315 km (4 hours drive)  Izmir Airport - 350 km (5 hours drive)      Dalaman is probably your best bet, because its much closer.    You can go on Turkish Airlines, or Delta Airlines I'm not sure if thats in the UK but still. Or you could even go on http://www.cheapflights.co.uk.    Hope this helped.. Ohhh and I little word of advice don't speak english by salespeople because they will charge you more then the actual price..    Have fun.. :))|`|525eb07b25abcf2dd87f01b89a5f1dfdaa	Dalaman will be your best option. It serves most of the major resorts. To be honest there isn't a load of choice the way there are with UK airports. If you go out of your way you will end up driving hours along mountain paths as there aren't rail links. Best thing to do is pick a date you want to fly and wait as close as possible to the time before you book.

I want to say it's $15 or $20 and it's just 2-3 stops.      To get to north county I take the 41 from Fashion Valley (get off in Old Town and transfer to the Santee green line trolley, 3rd stop). Take the 41 to the VA hospital, transfer to the North county bus (101), and ride it to Oceanside. $5.00 day pass can be used on both buses, but if you have a lot of stuff you're better off just taking Amtrak there and back.     There is a bus that goes on Camp Pendleton, I think it's 395 and you don't need military ID for that.Civilians bike ride the roads as a route to San Clemente.
6BnRgWUNaa	What do you mean it?  People in Italy is very sweet..especially in the south..  they always try to make you comfortable in every situation..  Just be yourself..|`|HEf129Hvaa	1. Don't expect everyone to speak English. Don't get all pissy because not everyone speaks English.  Don't go around saying, "Oh my God!  Why don't they speak English here?".  Trust me, it's very annoying.  Heck, it's annoying to me and I'm American.  Immagine what it's like for an Italian to hear these comments in Italy.      2.  Don't steal    3.  Don't throw your trash on the floor.  Even if you see the streets are dirty, don't do it.      4.  Don't make stupid mafia comments.  Mafia and other organized crimes do exist, but Italians hate this stereotype about them.      5.  Don't take your shoes off in public places.  I know, this sounds absurd, but I have seen tourists do this.  You're at a coffee shop drinking a cappuccino and some broad takes her shoes off.  Then to top things off, she puts her smelly feet up on the table.  Grrrrrrr!!!    etc. etc. etc.       Basically, try to act like a decent human being, and you'll be treated fine.  Italians are very friendly people.  If they see you at least attempt to speak Italian or are at least friendly to them, they will do their best to treat you really well.

T42Nt3Lyaa	If the 22000 is after taxes, yes it will be enogh to live a reasonable middle class lifestyle.  Car installments on a newish smallish car will be around R1500 - R2000 per month.  School fees is a good public school will be in the range of R1000 per month per child.  A trolley of food in a supermarket will cost around R1500.  A family meal in a decent restaurant will be around R400.    2) Relatively secure.  3) Not all that much, most homes are already burglar barred. You may want to get a private armed response such as ADT, they usualy charged around R300 per month and will provide the alarm system for free if you sign a contract with them.  4) Yes  5) I woulad guess around R3500 - 6500 depending upon the area and accommodation. Have a look at gumtree for rental classifieds in Durban, http://durban.gumtree.co.za/f-Flat-House...|`|lDJWOEQSaa	Sai K must live in a dream world and definitely has no children yet ! Yes you'll make a living with 22k providing you stick to a very strict budget ! Groceries of R1500 ? ha ha ha , per week maybe !  Durban has a very close Indian community and they take care of each other . Crime is much lower in the Indian areas too .You will be fine . The question is if that is what you want in life !? Let's face it , first priority will be your kids . Excellent schools in Durban , good community and it will be easy to bring your kids up with the correct moral values as there are plenty of mosques in Durbs . I hope you will make a success with your new career !|`|feqF1bP1aa	The compensation is adequate for moderate living in Durban.     The tax rate is about 30%.    A two bedroom apartment will cost you about R4000 per month rent in a middle class area (this could even include basic furniture)    Petrol is about R6-50 per litre. A Big Mac Burger, coke and french fries is R21-00. A good second hand car will cost R40000-00 (about 6 years old). Food and household cleaners will cost you about R1500-00 per month. Transport to work by privately owned taxi mini buses is about R800-00 per month. Dinner for two at a good restaurant will a bottle of wine is about R300-00 (three course meal). Private medical aid is about R1200-00 per month.    Accomodation is not a problem but you will have to pay a deposit of one or two months rent in advance, before you will be allowed to move in.    The crime - depends where you compare it to! The important thing is to know how to behave: lock your car doors when driving, be aware of your surroundings, don't leave goods lying in your car where they are visible etc. If you do these things and stay out of the high crime areas, you will be fine. Most people do pay for security which can cost up to R1 000 per month.     Good luck with your plans

There is Brent Cross shopping centre to the North of the city.|`|AA11349530	there's the new one just opened called Westfield <a href="http://uk.westfield.com/london/?gclid=CO-46tjU6pgCFQyjQwodMSd-zw" rel="nofollow">http://uk.westfield.com/london/?gclid=CO...</a> as well as Brent Cross in the northern suburbs, Lakeside on the outskirts to the east and Bluewater just outside of London down in Kent ... there are lots of smaller malls in various traditional shopping areas (e.g. our local one is Wood Green Shopping City in the suburbs) where you get a mall as well as street properties ... we call them "shopping centres" when they are indoors under a roof ... but many of our good shopping areas are not in purpose built malls but are street properties like you get along Oxford Street etc|`|WhAKntgGaa	Pall Mall haha wtf.<br>  <br>  Stupid question.|`|6ycZ1LO5aa	U mean our shopping centres... We not known for our shopping centres but I'd say the best one is the newly opened Westfields in Shepards Bush... <br>  Our shops our mainly outside on the high street.... Oxford Circus is the best shopping place... Has absolutely evrything there...|`|fZgoUty4aa	we do not have malls|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	oh too many to count...|`|0wTOMifKaa	I'm sorry but you will have to be careful because we have this thing called "The outside".  I know it's big and scary.<br>  <br>  But please be Brave and try it.  You might even enjoy the sensation of walking between different stores via Sun/Moonshine.<br>  <br>  There is even occasionally this thing called rain, but don't worry it all adds to the fun of getting squashed whilst wandering around London.<br>  <br>  The art of shopping in London is to either go out with a strict plan to go to A then B etc.. without deviation or the complete opposite, which I think is more fun, you can just wander around it's great finding the weird little shops.|`|NARiXGNDaa	wow alot.. my best one has to be oxford st<even tho its not a mall, it has plenty>, maybe try brent cross, wood green shopping centers...for a more budget one wood greens real good, you have the actual mall and then you have  a street packed with shops on sales ect...also in beckton there a massive shopping area...get the DLR and get off at beckton and ask around for the shopping mall, or get off at gallions reach, they have real good shops there...erm they have boots clearance store and even next clearance store ther..try it..<br>  <br>  have fun<br>  <br>  x|`|Up6wkVLvaa	We don't really go in for malls.  We have some shopping centres but they aren't that good.  I think you'll find most of the good shops in the good old fashioned outside.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	there's a Lovely one in Piccadilly called the BURLINGTON ARCADE,it's absolutely historic and a great building

iN27E3WCaa	September can be tricky because it's hurricane season.  Have you considered going to Mexico?  They have some very nice all-inclusive resorts that will probably be able to fit your budget.  Mexico has some lovely snorkeling: <a href="http://www.snorkeling.info/snorkeling-locations/mexico/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snorkeling.info/snorkeling-lo...</a>|`|gym3Do4Haa	Check out Malaysia at the source below. There is definitely  something to interest you both  for sure but you'll need to liase with the travel agencies for the budget you have.|`|5dOJovqbaa	Are you interested in something on this page?<br>  <a href="http://www.ytbromance.com/home.aspx?ytbid=418748" rel="nofollow">http://www.ytbromance.com/home.aspx?ytbi...</a>|`|AA12266736	Taking the opportunity to promote my own country. <br>  Philippines! <br>  Great beaches, exotic wildlife. <br>  Not sure about if September is in the typhoon season though.
4t2kd03Waa	I have been to Myanmar (Burma).  This country is an absolute closed society.  When I was in Rangoon the place was almost like strange. No bars, almost all shops closed, strange place. The military junta that controls this country keeps it closed so they can control the people.<br>  At this time I see nothing significant that Burma has to offer this country.|`|vTra7n5baa	No!  Aside from the economic isolation and political turmoil, Myanmar is on OFACs list of forbidden countries for American citizens to send money to.  If you do it without government permission, you're looking at serious jail time!|`|ff91718298bb9183945eb4d46904ac39aa	The political situation is horrible there.  But in economic theory, trade with any country is good, look up comparative advantage.  Look some other things up like WTO, GATT while you're at it.|`|kWAm7syDaa	<a href="http://getinall.palacebet.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinall.palacebet.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, that depend on what part of Queens you coming from. Queens is a very large borough with different sections, such as Flushing, Far Rockaway, Jamaica, Astoria, Long Island City, etc. You will need to make you question more specific in order for us to help you.<br>  <br>  Just drop me a line by clicking on the avatar and e-mail icon in the profile. I'll be glad to help.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QX2xnrhWaa	Riverside Park is on the western edge of Manhattan's upper west side (starting in the W. 70ies) and running north all the way up to Inwood.<br>  Queens is a large borough, like Native New Yorker said - so it really depends where in Queens you're talking about.   e.g.  both La Guardia & JFK are in Queens, and there is quite a distance between the two.  If you're in Astoria, you'll actually be closer to Riverside Park than to JFK....
