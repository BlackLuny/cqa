r3WkhpBpaa	DEFEND THEMSELVES????? They are the ones firing rockets into Israel!!!!!!! Israel is the one that needs to defend itself.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Yes.  The Palestinians have the right to demand their land back.  In 1947 the UN voted to give land that the UN did not own, to the Zionists.  The world, including the US and Russia, were complicit.  <br>  <br>  Israel: give it back.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The Zionists had the options of going to Africa or South America.  Some were actually in favor.  But when the British supported a return to Ottoman Palestine, and with the death of a main supporter of the Africa solution, the Zionists who wanted to steal the land from Palestinians held the day.  And the UN (the US/Britain/Russia) bought it too.  <br>  <br>  So now we all pay in money and blood because a selfish group of thieves could not be told to do the right thing.  Wonderful.|`|0eFSeap5aa	I had the right to remain silent, but not the ability<br>  -- Ron White<br>  <br>  Same concept.|`|fDuCamMraa	Yes. And as long as they keep indiscriminately firing off rockets in to Israel, then the Israelis have the right to annihilate them.  <br>  <br>  They kill three or four Israelis, and the Israelis kill 3 or 4 hundred of them in return. Not very bright are they.|`|WIczM4URaa	3000 years ago? well american indians are not rocketing mcdonalds and starbucks so it must mean they adjusted and accepted their fate. <br>  <br>  its called winning the war. <br>  <br>  as they say, some people are so dumb they don't know when theyve lost. <br>  <br>  at least be like the irish and come up with good rock n roll bands.|`|Yx1kEsCHaa	Yes, Israel came out of nowhere and demanded land.|`|UFgCBvwSaa	In 1948, the United Nations took the country of Palestine away from the Palestinians and gave it to the Jews, in part, because no one knew what to do with them after the Holocaust.<br>  <br>  That is the crux of the problem in Israel.<br>  <br>  Palestine isn't a State; it is technically Israel. Therefore Palestine does not have the right to defend itself legally. However, see as how the Palestinians got shafted in 1948, one should see that even the preemptive strikes that they do on Israel can be interpreted as defense.<br>  <br>  It's an ugly situation over there and BOTH sides have blood on their hands.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Yes. And if you go back far enough you will probably find someone who was there before. It's akin to saying Native Americans should have the right to kick everyone else out of the country. This idea actually applies to both sides in this dispute. What bothers me is that Israel has considerably bigger guns and is not too concerned about using them. In my opinion both sides have a legitimate claim and the only way to actually stop fighting is for both sides to first acknowledge that the other side does have some claim.|`|ntuJzqycaa	Yes, they have a right to defend against the occupiers.<br>  <br>  By any means necessary.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Yes of course they do.  If anyone is being bombed, why would they not have the right to defend themself?  Israel is really going way overboard in this conflict...|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	yes but so does Israel my friend, and they did defend themselves against Hamas.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Defend or Attack?  Big difference between who fires the first shot and who responds.|`|5GJSJyiXaa	Palestine has the right to ask the International Court (The UN) to return its statehood by returning Palestine to its original borders it had before 1948. Actually to what they were before WW1. If the UN doesn't approve or doesn't approve fast enough for the Palestinians that doesn't give them the right to take the law into their own hands by attacking Israel. I think both nations should stop attacking each other because Israel was established as a country in 1948 by right of the Germans invasion and certain other interested parties for control of the oil and the Palestinians lost their "birth right" which was their statehood before the German invasion. The are always winners and losers, there are not just reasons for going to war only to get control of the resources of another country. Israel and Palestine should talk to their elders who are still of sound mind to look at the histories of their countries to determine what really happened and who was behind WW1 and WW2 because it wasn't just about "Nazi's", "The Axis Power", the "Third Reich". It was about "who" would control the oil in the Middle East. Unfortunately for the peoples in that area of the world, the only written history they have is what's in their "holy writings. Unfortunately for so many Americans their holy writings are tainted by the wishes and dreams of King James, who had an edict to translate the holy writings of the Middle Eastern People (Ottoman Empire) into English so he could "give his people something spiritual and holy" while he went about planning on how to control the resources of the land of the people who lived in the Ottoman Empire. <br>  <br>  Greed begets greed.

If you guys are in demand (& you will be, especially if you are sent to the desert), the opportunities for school at night/off duty hours are going to be pretty slim.  <br>  <br>  The only thing I can highly recommend is talk to your NCOIC at your unit & see what you have to do in order to get your command to give you the opportunity to take classes during off duty time.  You may have to pull some extra duty, or suck up additional work to prove that you won't slack off in your job to attend school.  Yeah, I know this isn't the answer you want to hear.  Unfortunately, this is common place in the Army  after 9/11.  I was in a medical MOS when I was on AD, & I flipped thhrough hoops to take classes during off duty time because we were on call, had emergencies, etc, that would seriously screw with trying to take classes after work.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Sounds like an interesting job you'll have in the Army.  ANd stay safe!|`|014NXPfFaa	My husband is in a unit that deploys often and has crazy training cycles . . . he still finds time to take classes - he has to do them online and only one at a time, but he gets done 5-8 classes per year . . .|`|gvukdlOjaa	It depends a lot on what your job is and where you're stationed.  <br>  <br>  In general though, in the course of your duties, you hardly have any time for college classes.<br>  <br>  My advice is to sign-up for four years, then get out and use your GI Bill for college.  Just remember that at any point you can be called back into service via IRR eight years after your enlistment date, no matter if you're out and in college or not.|`|HFSk25tDaa	none, don't kid yourself. between basic and ait, you'll be training forever.<br>  go with ROTC, you can pursue your education for 2/4 years without interruption and graduate as an officer.<br>  <br>  goarmy.com/rotc<br>  <br>  scholarships available. check it out!<br>  <br>  HOOAH!|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Depends on how much free time you have at your unit.

I flip him off every time I drive by.  Honestly, having debated pro-lifers on numerous occasions, they really don't have any other answer than that it is murder regardless of the circumstances.  <br>  <br>  These zealots don't have an answer when you ask them about the sex trade, when you ask about child rape, when you ask about anything that has to do with women's rights.  Dog help them they should ever have to deal with reality.  And then we have the Catholics...well, what can anyone say about them?  They rape little boys and file bankruptcy when they get sued.

We just  see it differently. I do not believe any parent has the right to choose life or death for their child. I am not crazy and neither are you.

Its about speaking up for what I believe, cause its a fact that whether these laws change or not, nothing happens if no one speaks up. And I am one of those who has lived out what I ask others to do so there is no hypocrisy here. In cases of child rape or health risks to the mother, a public clinic is not needed. This does not support  public access to abortion. Neither does the fact that there are pedophiles in the world. I am not the only one who does not see killing a baby as a woman's right.|`|OXmn9pe9aa	Somehow I think no matter what answer you get here, it will not change your mind.<br>  <br>  It is your choice, but don't bash those that feel its a sin and murder.|`|oDiUzwQkaa	a baby is alive at the moment of conception. abortion is like MURDER!!!|`|9Vchzon2aa	I didn't read all that, but<br>  <br>  Democrats = baby killers.

She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee (on 11/17/95) about what she witnessed. According to nurse Shafer, the baby was alive and moving as the abortionist “delivered the baby’s body and arms - everything but the head. The doctor kept the baby’s head just inside the uterus. The baby’s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, his feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his head, and the baby’s arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does when he thinks he might fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening and sucked the baby’s brains out. Now the baby was completely limp.”<br>  <br>  <br>   With forceps, the doctor turns the baby around in the womb to be positioned feet first. The baby’s legs are pulled out into the birth canal. The baby is alive at this point. .  <br>   The abortionist delivers the baby’s entire body, except for the head, which remains inside the birth canal. The baby’s hands and feet move <br>   The abortionist stabs the scissors into the base of the baby’s skull. The scissors are spread to enlarge the opening. The suction catheter is then inserted and the brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The head slides out easily. <br>  <br>  <br>  ARE THE BABIES ALIVE DURING THE ABORTION?<br>  <br>  Yes! On July 11, 1995, American Medical News (AMA’s official journal) submitted the transcript of a tape-recorded interview with abortionist Dr. Martin Haskell to the House Judiciary Committee in which he admitted: “...the majority of fetuses aborted this way (partial birth abortion) are alive|`|QlrIUIfOaa	The moment of conception, like all abortion arguments, is a straw man.<br>  <br>  The purpose of the "pro-life movement" is to stir up phony religious wackos and get them to come out and vote for something (neocons) before they realize what they voted for (unnecessary war and tax cuts for the wealthy).  <br>  <br>  Do you know of any conservative R parents who gave up an Ivy League admittance so their daughter could stay home and give birth to the pool boy's child?

The impulsive answer is schools. But it depends a lot on what benefit you're talking about. Although there is valid argument that better education means less petty crime (in a broad sense). It doesn't necessarily mean a reduction in crime over the board. One possibility is you simply end up with better educated criminals. <br>  <br>  I still ultimately think investing in education (assuming the investment is just as effective in education as in prisons, so the same amount of money disappears or gets stuck in the administration process) is more beneficial in the long run. The education system is a large employer, it produces a more skilled workforce and hopefully makes people a little smarter and more responsible human beings. Prison on the other hand can be a big employer, but also involves having all those prisoners being mostly unproductive, not to mention it doesn't give much hope for better people in the future (just that any new criminals will have more space).|`|8c26428851da1c5fae2061ea4bfe5f60aa	Well, CA has been pouring money into schools /and/ prisons for decades, and has little to show for either.  <br>  <br>  A third option might be good.  Internal enforcement of immigration laws, for instance, would keep schools and prisons from being packed with anchor babies and illegals, respectively.  Rationalizing our drug laws would go a long way towards reducing the need for quite so many prisons.  If our educational system were to take the blindingly simple step of acknowledging that many individuals simply don't need and can't benefit from higher education, and put more focus on vocational programs, instead, it would probably be more successful, too.<br>  <br>  If there's one thing that America has demonstrated in the past 50 years or so, it's that simply spending more money on something doesn't make it better.|`|VSVIpM2gaa	Here's a GREAT lib idea.

It's all in the USN uniform regulations under grooming standards if you want to google it and check the specifics.|`|neWbgaHCaa	There are a few of my shipmates that have full sleeves. <br>  They got most of their work done when they were in already, so I don't know about you getting in.

All of them got their contracts and were very happy.<br>  <br>  I dont advise you getting new tatts if u plan on joining, you should wait until your done with boot camp and a-school.|`|FC0PB8Xjaa	they don't want you to get them done below your elbow once you are in.  you can come in with what you have.  If there are any gang symbols or anything like that on them you will have to get them removed.  As far as getting more when you are in you can get as many as you want as long as they can be covered up in any uniform.  All you have to do is request to get one and send the artwork up with it.  But what it all boils down to is your command.  Some commands are different from others and have different sets of rules.  when you get to your first command ask around and find out what the command regulations are on tattoos.|`|C6ymnSWoaa	My husband has tattoos.

9uka7FKeaa	Those who say abortion is murder but are for the death penalty are major hypocrites.|`|VjgqZetcaa	No, murder is an "illegal" homicide and an execution is a legal homicide because we believe in the benefits of removing scum from our society after they have been convicted of committing certain crimes.  Of course, it would be much simpler if more crime victims could simply execute the criminal on the spot, in self defense, so we don't have to pay to investigate, track him down, put on a trial, listen to endless appeals and only THEN execute him.  Massachusetts, back in the 1860s, you had two weeks in which to appeal a death sentence and then you would be executed on the 15th day, unless your appeal were still pending..|`|VpXrsxGGaa	i am all for the death penilty <br>  some people dont deserve to live any more <br>  and keeping them in prizons uses our money and they get treated alot better then people think food cloths all sorts of stuff and the big gangs often have thier leaders incarcerated in prison and still sending out comands
AA11707728	Depends.  Do you mean for carry or for home defense.<br>  <br>  The various calibers of weapon have different stopping powers.....defined as the percentage of the time you shoot someone and they fall down and are unable to continue attacking.  Hardball ammunition has an unacceptable level of stopping power.  Instead, you should use hollowpoints (something like hydrashocks).<br>  <br>  The smallest caliber with acceptable stopping power is a .380.  It stops people around 80% of the time.  Better, though is 9mm and above.  9mm stops around 90% of the time.  .40 and .357 are tied at about 96% of the time.<br>  <br>  Pretty much, the best sidearm is the Glock model 23, which a .40 double action pistol.  However, it is not ideal for carry.  It's too damn large.  Large handguns tend to be left behind because they are inconvenient.  Leaving behind your weapon is a rather big deal.  A small weapon you actually have on you is far better than the best handgun you left at home because it was inconvenient to carry that one time.<br>  <br>  However, smaller handguns have less stopping power because the barrel is so much shorter.  I find the Smith and Wesson .380 pocket pistol is an acceptable tradeoff.  It is far weaker than my Glock .40 but it is EASY to conceal.  This weapon also comes in 9mm, but I've never shot one.  It's probably alot better though.<br>  <br>  One weapon to seriously consider is the Boberg Pocket Pistol.  They've re-engineered the way a pistol is usally made so as to pull the firing mechanism back alot farther.  This allows them to have a full sized barrel in a pocket pistol sized gun.  A FAR more powerful weapon than any other pocket pistol.  I don't have one, but I suspect this is the best concealed carry weapon money can buy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bobergengineering.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobergengineering.com/</a>|`|AA11315360	First you have to go get a permit to have a gun. Talk to your local police station. if you shoot someone in your home and you DONT have a permit to have a gun and it isnt registered then you will be in big trouble.<br>  Also in most cases if you just show a robber, etc the gun they will run in fear. Get properly trained in how to use it.<br>  <br>  Any handgun is fine. You need one that is comfortable in size for you. Women need smaller guns and men need a bit larger guns. Talk to a gun shop owner they will help you.|`|sgjjwXwwaa	You really can't go wrong with a Glock handgun...<br>  <br>  Simple, reliable, high capacity magazines, scary looking...<br>  <br>  I have a Glock 19 (9mm compact size) and a Glock 21 (.45acp, full size)... Both are great guns, and really easy to shoot.<br>  <br>  ...and before I get a bunch of thumbs downs, I've only ever killed pop cans with my handguns and I hope things never change.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	One that you can shoot accurately with.|`|fRQHpKCPaa	Before you are swamped by alot of gun guru's to your question. Is this gun for home defense or concealed carry in a state that authorizes it?<br>  As far as reliability you can't go wrong with a revolver. If the round/bullet fails to cook off you just pull the trigger again. The con about revolvers theres not too much of safety esp if you have kids and this is for home defense. Alot of laws out there about home storage with kids in the house. Guns for legally carrying concealed alot of the major brands you can't go wrong with. The rule of thumb is find a gun that fits your hand comfortably and carry the largest caliber you can handle fast and effectively. Rent different calibers at your local gun range they will be happy to assist. Take a few courses theres plenty of instructors in every state. *Good luck*|`|P8v8nkqdaa	Do you want an auto or revolver?<br>  <br>  I really prefer the low-velocity .45 Smith and Wesson model 457.  It's a short-barreled semi auto pistol.  Another choice would be a quality and inexpensive revolver .357 or .38 caliber by Taurus.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3QtO3SpFaa	Well, my own opinion is either a .40 cal. or a .45 semiautomatic. They also have hydroshock rounds for both caliber weapons. Anything more than that is over kill.|`|5YjMM33zaa	best gun is a phone.<br>  so you can call 911 to protect<br>  you. Guns are dangerous to <br>  keep in the home especially<br>  if you have kids. Or even friends<br>  with kids kids like to explore...!|`|gRXngD9aaa	911.  Yeah, right.  You'd be dead long before the cops showed up.<br>  <br>  Get an M60.  Worked great for Rambo.<br>  <br>  Plus a couple of hand grenades, just in case.|`|6lyGn3kKaa	A revolver.

The idea of drilling would be to tap oil in our own country, Why would it be contradictory ? It would allow us to sustain ourselves with out being potentially held hostage by foreign oil, While we came up with alternative energy to supplement or completely replace our current needs.The only people who would be able to hold us hostage if we tapped our own reserves ( And I believe they would partially) would be the oil companies. God bless.<br>  <br>  OK, After writing this I did not see your details. Drilling would still be beneficial for us until we were able to come up with alternative solutions, Research takes money, And right now, Money is something were lacking in, But then again, Money seems to be no object to government, Seeing how they see nothing wrong with tapping our childrens future for it. God bless.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	No. There's enough oil in ANWR for America to be energy  independent for 20-50 years but environmentalists and special interests won't allow us to drill.<br>  I think 20-50 years is long enough to come up with more efficient alternative energies.|`|AA11151307	Yeah.<br>  <br>  Renewable energy is going to *chafe* the oil industry to no ends.<br>  <br>  Maybe give them a cosmic wedgie in the process.<br>  <br>  Just watch.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	No bcuz if we drill our own oil, then we have energy independence.|`|r8tpwmixaa	Quite the opposite actually.|`|uGsyzDaaaa	Things must be pretty bad when Jesus has to ask this question.|`|8c26428851da1c5fae2061ea4bfe5f60aa	Sure, domestic production has to be part of the solution, if you want 'independence' from foreign imports.

I didn't realize this was that difficult a concept to grasp.<br>  <br>  As for renewable energy, the fact is that it costs more and is less reliable than other sources of energy.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Not at all.<br>  <br>  How so?<br>  <br>  Doesnt it make sense, that if your standing on all this wealth, why not go get it and use it for yourself?

27b7cbeab3efac60aa8a9ba921dc0a33aa	Should the government take care of you when you are unable to do it yourself?  Absolutely.  Why?  That is what civilized societies do.<br>  <br>  A platoon of Marines are in battle.  An enemy sniper puts a bullet through one of them.  What happens?  Do his fellow soldiers leave him there and say "Tough Break.  You are on your own".  No.  His fellow soldiers provide cover fire.  Two men grab him by his web gear and drag him to safety.  A corpsman run up and checked his wounds, patches him up, and gives it his all to keep the wounded man alive.  Why?  That is what people do for one another.<br>  <br>  What would our society have to gain by letting its people starve?  Oops, sorry Mr. J.  GM went out of business.  Tough luck there.  Good luck with dinner tonight.  <br>  <br>  I am all for encouraging people to make it on their own.  This is probably why an unemployment check is about 1/10th of what I make.  In theory, it should encourage me to get up and find another job.<br>  <br>  If you fail to help your own people in their hour of need, they become desperate.  If they become desperate, bad things happen to society.  Illegal activity from muggings, theft, or selling kids will happen.<br>  <br>  Why should we save our companies?  Where the hell are people going to work?  The US is still the manufactoring powerhouse of the world, but we have been losing ground to China at an astronomical rate.

Is it right to give health insurance to all?  No.  Like you mentioned, let people get out and get a job to get their own.  Is it right to throw a layed off employee a lifeline?  Absolutely.  Is it right to encourage a mother with 13 kids to stay on food stamps?  Nope.<br>  <br>  The system has to be set up to take care of people, but at the same time, help people to help themselves.

056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	Great question. I think that Obama is worsening it by design.  Never let a good crisis go to waste.  It is a great chance to grow gov't. I think that the initial catalyst for the crisis - toxic real estate debt, was probably not by design, at least not with regard to its effect on the economy.  Barney Frank and ACORN were just trying to get people into McMansions.  But increasing the national debt when we should cut spending is absolutely by design as is talking down the economy.|`|e4755faeab1ce327b95c1129793886a7aa	It's not coincidence.  Everything affects everything else.  When one sector crashes, other ones come down with it.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Sure it was. The rich conspire to take everyones money and keep it. Banks didn't conspire to redistribute wealth to poor people and neither did the Democratic party because if that were the case then the party would have cut its own throats. They needed the banks to get elected as do Republicans. Poor people didn't conspire to take wealth from the rich because they don't have the power to do that in the first place so there is ONLY one group capable of such a conspiracy.. The filthy rich. They conspire to take OUR money, keep it then have us all fight with each other over the scraps.. Oldest trick in the book and it works every time. Always has, always will. Think about it. We're at each others throats constantly over billions of dollars, but when the hell was the last time you ever saw a billion dollars let alone ever got to decide anything about it?<br>  Neither democrats nor republicans are smarter than the other. We're equally as stupid for falling for the oldest manipulation trick since money was invented and we fall for the same old BS over and over and over and over and over AS IF we'll EVER get the chance to even glance for one second at a billion dollars worth of dog drool let alone the national treasury.<br>  They toss around the word billion like it was bubblegum money and yet we worry about people making over $250k. We fight like dogs over a $20 winning scratch off lottery ticket. Watch a gas station drop gas prices a dollar under the one across the street and we'll have a riot out front and we'll kill each other to be first in line. Let some sap drop money from a building on any busy street, even $1 dollar bills and watch the mayhem.<br>  Is it by design? You bet your sweet keester it was be design. And the sad part....we'll fall for it from now till the end of time because it works like rain in a desert. The rich treat us as if the sexiest broad in the world was giving away free butt screws and we stand in line to get the screwing for her  without so much as a kiss nor a dabble of vaseline. Was is by design? Well, duh....|`|XU5SVQZDaa	Yes, most definitely. One world global gov't is just around the corner. And, we won't be happy with it. The last depression will look like a picnic on a sunny day and I've heard people speak about it-it was plain horrible and bare survival. My Dad was given a bullet-just one-and he had to bring back food or they would have none. Like the potatoe famine, millions died-in Ireland. The gov't is hoping for that-to get rid of alot of us. I trust the Lord Jesus Christ to get me and mine through this-if thats His Will. Our only hope is not in the government-remember Katrina-they let them die in the streets and Ruby Ridge and Waco and how this gov't put smallpox in Native Americans blankets to get rid of them? The spirit behind this gov't hasn't changed. All the nations of the world are in the same boat,too.

1Mc6BOvKaa	Interfering with the mail is a crime taken very seriously, and because of the punishments handed out to postal workers caught doing anything illegal, it is actually very rare, especially as most postmen in my experience tend to be honest and fair, with a level of respect for their customers. Remember delivery staff have to deal with the same people every day.<br>  <br>  So, first think if there's any other possibility. Its common for mail to get ripped around the edges, giving the impression of attempted opening. This can be caused by the machines used to sort the mail. Also, if your letter box is quite stiff, letters could be getting damaged whilst being put in there. Also, sometimes elastic bands used to bundle the mail together can stick and cause rips.<br>  Also, think if anyone else has access to your mail. Is it in an external box, or communal area?<br>  <br>  If you think all of the above are unlikely, take it to the next level.<br>  <br>  Contact the relevant authorities. In the UK, you can try Royal Mail complaints / customer services. (08457 740 740) You could also try the number for your local Delivery Office (will have a geographic area code beginning 01 or 02, instead of an 08 number). Finally, there's Postwatch, the regulator.<br>  <br>  If all of your mail, coming from different places, appears to be tampered with, its possible that its a local member of staff, who is doing it regularly. This means it'll be easy to track and stop him.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	contact the post office and ask for an inspector|`|Yg2iIneKaa	just call the fbi

6Zzh6EVXaa	he won't get much if he already completed his sentence from the dui. the court just wanted him to come back to see if he was doing what he was suppose to do. he is probably in there waiting on a court date. but waiting 5 days is an awful long time to wait for a court date. are you sure he completed all his sentence? either way he should be going to court any day now. his punishment will be the 5 days he's been there plus the cost of the warrant and court cost. oh! make sure that someone from the clerks office or the teacher from the classes he attended didn't tell him that since he fulfilled his obligation to the court that he doesn't have to show back up for his court date. they do that sometimes. saves the courts money by doing that. goodluck!|`|AA11376640	from my experience, till the next available court date, usually the next day!|`|hzsdJAwLaa	In California its 2 weeks before you get to see the judge

Sounds like you need some serious 'real time' help. Hire a lawyer asap to help you.|`|pwQbQPllaa	Not being negative but this can and most likely WILL effect your future plans IF it goes to trial and they rule you guilty. Something like this can't be considered a misdemeanor (which in interviews they usually look over). Your best bet is to NOT tell your side of the story, especially like you told it above get a lawyer and have them take care of business, i work in a lawfirm in Cincinnati, OH so i kinda know the law. Once it goes to trial like i said if convicted guilty it will always stay on your record since you are 19. I'm sorry for everything your best bet is to find a Dr. and possibly try to say that it was in a dead sleep and you have "night terrors", "sleepwalk" etc, because there are people who act out their dreams, but you need to be in a state of REM sleep for this to happen. Again i'm sorry, but hope i answered some questions for you.

5UW2P8IMaa	I had to testify in a criminal case, a money laundering case in Federal Court in Pittsburgh, PA, about 20 years ago.  Go to the trial with a positive frame of mind and be relaxed about it.  Because you had given a deposition, there will be some questioning based on whether your testimony at the hearing is consistent with the earlier testimony you gave.<br>  <br>  Get a good night's sleep before you testify, be relaxed, and don't worry. You will do fine.  I think you will find the whole experience rather mundane and even boring.|`|dyAMG21Laa	Yes, I have.  Just go over what you actually saw so that you can answer any questions without hesitating.  Don't read more into a question than what is being asked.  Also don't give more information than what is being asked.   Usually the lawyer representing the person you are testifying for will go over your testimony.   Practice deep breathing.  No one can make you feel anything unless you let them.  You're in control|`|XD42367paa	First of all, relax. You are just going to be asked some questions and it will be much less dramatic than you think it will. Be as honest as you can, think before you speak, and only answer the questions you are asked....don't elaborate. Short and sweet. You'll be fine. <br>  <br>  I've testified a number of times as a Guardian ad Litem, where kids' lives and well being are at stake. It helps to know that the people there mostly just want to do the best they can for the people concerned.<br>  <br>  And not to burst your bubble, but no one in the court room is going to care that much about you, personally.

Breathe.|`|qkblT2hgaa	You don't have to worry about it as you are not on trial. You will be asked to take the stand and swear that you will tell the truth. You may have to read your deposition in court but more often, the defence lawyer and prosecutor will question you regarding what you actually saw that day. Stick to the story that you gave during your deposition. Any deviation from the story leaves you open to questions from the lawyers. If your deposition favours the defence, it will be the prosecutor that will try and find holes in your story (and vice verse).<br>  <br>  Some important tips:<br>  Remain calm at all times, deep breaths if you have to.<br>  Stick to the story that you first gave. Don't start and add information as you go.<br>  Remember that you are not on trial. <br>  Check your subpoena, whoever requested you there (defence or prosecutor) will be able to help walk you through the steps.

Ronny Raygun left the largest deficit of it's kind prior to the George W. fiasco that blew a trillion dollar budget surplus and dumped us 10 trillion additional dollars in debt before he left office, which means that only 2t of that comes from the stimulus package (remember that a trillion dollar bailout was passed under George W. and it went to give bonuses and raises to CEOs). Oh, and because King George the 2nd (George W.) kept the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a secret, his total legacy of debt to the Chinese may surpass 15 trillion.

5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Yes, I do trust police officers!<br>  <br>  I trust them to do their job to the best of their ability every day, and what a difficult job that is!<br>  <br>  If their training leads them to believe that a person deserves a ticket for an offense, they should cite the offender ... unless they decide to give a guy a break!<br>  <br>  "misconstrue something that was transmitted from dispatch"?  I've honestly never heard of that happening ... the dispatcher and the officer are both professionals ... care to give an example?<br>  <br>  "make things worse than they need to be for everyone?"  Again I have to say I've never heard of that happening (maybe the officers I know are just better than average?)  Although it might seem that way at times!  Take domestic violence for example ... if the offender is put in jail, no doubt about it ... that will cause some problems for the family involved!  Did the officer really make things worse by arresting the aggressor?  Not in most cases!  Left alone, the offender would probably continue to assault the victim, causing more severe injuries or death!<br>  <br>  Occasionally officers do "let the bad guys get away" but it is usually not for lack of effort!  Does ANYONE have a 100% rating on their job?  Heck, I know I don't!  We can only expect a person to give their best effort to a job .... perfection is too high a standard to expect from ANY human!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, in spite of the best efforts of law enforcement and the courts, the bad guy gets away with a crime!  That is a fact of life!  Most officers hate it, so do most judges and prosecutors ... but it happens!  The system is not perfect!  The system is run by humans! Humans are not perfect!  Get over it!  It's a pain in the A$$ when it happens, but if everybody involved gave their best effort ... what are you going to do?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  "Crazy Dave" this is for you dude!  <br>  <br>  How much of that case "in the northeast" did you actually find out about?  I followed that case very closely (through many sources, most of them had a fairly "liberal" slant!).<br>  <br>  The alleged "victim" of overzealous police was in the company of at least one person that made the comment that "they had to get their "gat" out of the car" ... do you know what a "gat" is?  (It's a gun)<br>  <br>  The "groom" was the driver of a vehicle when he was shot.  Before he was shot he had attempted to run down an officer, rammed a van full of officers, and there was also an overheard statement that alleged that at least one person in the car had access to a firearm (as reported by the NY Post ... hardly a conservative mouthpiece or a supporter of the police!)<br>  <br>  After reading as much of the available information as I could (most of it provided by independant press sources) I determined that I would have shot at the car too!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	No. I don't trust them.

There is little reason not to unless you are a criminal. People that hate cops are usually either criminals or those that have a problem with authority. I know. I have spoke with both types. I am not a police officer but, I respect them and the difficult work they have to do.<br>  <br>  Are you serious? They should never carry a gun in the states? What have you been smoking? We would have exactly zero police officers in the US if they were not allowed to have guns. Very few would want to be police officers and the few that did would probably have a life expectancy of less than a year. <br>  What they do in the UK is irrelevant. It is a totally different mindset here in the US.<br>  <br>  SS is totally ignorant of police interviews. They ask all sorts of questions about integrity. I know, unlike her I have actually been through the interview process and passed. Pay no attention to her ignorance.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	I trust them 100%. Also it is not up to the cops to set them free or not charge them. They arrest them. Someone else takes over from there. For the record I do not trust people that distrust cops.

This usually falls in the ages of 17- 30 years of age. After this you become a bit wiser a bit more at ease with law enforcement and they in return are more receptive to the person making a complaint or getting pulled over for traffic problems. So with time it seems to begin to mellow for both sides and the wall begins to break down and at last the door of trust is open.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	No the police are worse than the "criminals" they arrest! They get away with murder! Just watch the news and do some research! They are the biggest gang of thugs in the U.S.. They used to be to protect and serve now its more like harass and extort! The American "JUSTICE" system is a joke! Its not about justice its about money! Even if the police did something wrong or something different than is in their report who is a judge going to believe? You, or a cop? America is becoming a police state! I live in Austin Texas and there have been a few officers who have shot and killed people who have been cuffed and or face down on the ground and shot in the back! The officers only lost their job but faced no criminal charges! How is that right? Then there is the groom in the North East who was shot and killed by three officers and he was unarmed and in his car. All three not only kept their jobs but faced no criminal penalties! It was murder but none were sent to prison! If you accidentally shot and killed someone you would go to prison for involuntary manslaughter would you not? So why not any criminal punishment for them? The American justice system is a joke! JUSTICE for all my A$$!<br>  <br>  Ornery and mean: More like a blinded sheep! No one else heard them say anything about a gun but the officers no other witnesses! If I was being fired upon I would have tried to drive away as well, hitting whatever was in my path! 3 officers fired so many rounds into the car that one or more of them had to reload! You are a fool! I hope that you remove yourself or get removed from the gene pool! Sheep like you are what is wrong with this country and why it is quickly becoming a police state! Wake up America it is only going to get worse! I do not care if anyone has access to a "GAT" if they are unarmed then their is no need for deadly force! Hopefully something will happen to you and the others like you at the hands of the police that will make you open your eyes to what is really going on! Who is to say the man did not say let me get my hat if he actually even said anything even close to that at all?|`|AA11100643	this is the oath i'l be taking soon, and yes believe it or not we do stand by it <br>  <br>  <br>  I DO SOLEMNLY DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR AND CONSCIENCE THAT I WILL ACT AT ALL TIMES TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE IN A MANNER BEFITTING A POLICE OFFICER<br>  <br>  I WILL PRESERVE THE DIGNITY AND WILL RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL INDIVIDUALS<br>  <br>  I WILL DISCHARGE MY DUTIES WITH INTEGRITY AND WILL PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING AND CONCILIATION<br>  <br>  I WILL EXERCISE MY AUTHORITY AS A POLICE OFFICER IN THE MANNER INTENDED BY THE LAW<br>  <br>  I WILL FAITHFULLY OBEY THE ORDERS OF MY SUPERIORS AND WILL BE READY TO CONFRONT DANGER IN THE LINE OF DUTY<br>  <br>  I WILL ACT WITH HONESTY, COURTESY AND REGARD FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS, AND WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DEVELOP THE ESPRIT DE CORPS<br>  <br>  I WILL ACT JUSTLY AND IMPARTIALLY AND WITH PROPRIETY TOWARDS MY FELLOW OFFICERS<br>  <br>  I WILL CONSTANTLY STRIVE TO HONOUR THIS OATH IN MY SERVICE AS A POLICE OFFICER|`|ukvLHcPpaa	After  the  local  Leo's  arrested  me   for  DWI   when  I   was  at  0.04%  brac    (I  was  found  not  guilty)    they  then  took  things  to  the  next  level  and  the  CID  Lt.   and  the   arresting  Officer   filed  a  complaint  with   the  Grand  Lodge  of  Arkansas  and  told  them  that  if  they  did  nothing   that   they   would  ****  me  up.

VsaEOX9vaa	I'm really talking here about legalization rather than just decriminalization, because the legalization seems to be the way to go after decriminalization.<br>  <br>  The pros (no pun intended) are many. I'm assuming that the prostitutes will operate from a licensed brothel or from home.<br>  <br>  Firstly, premises are licensed, the prostitutes have regular health checks, drug addicts are detected and given care, organised crime is reduced as the pros can work for themselves if they want. Underage prostitutes are usually easily detected. Street corner soliciting disappears, the brothels, in our region, are located usually in industrial estates away from exposure to school kids and the public at large. This all generates an air of respectability instead of the sleaze that exists where prostitution is illegal. <br>  <br>  The cons I'm not sure about, can't easily think of any. I think it's all positive to legalize/decriminalize it.<br>  <br>  It's called "the oldest profession" for a good reason and why shouldn't it be controlled just like any other business.|`|HVVyfR8paa	There are practically no pros.  All the pros, if you can call them that, come with revenues generated from the business and the money saved from not prosecuting and enforcing these laws.<br>  <br>  As for STD's no one can make such a claim.  We know it sounds good but in reality, very often this is not the case.  MOST countries where prostitution is a big industry struggle with large numbers of AIDS and other STD's cases. <br>  <br>  Psychologically, most prostitutes suffer from something akin to PTSD.  In all, the human toll is too great in my opinion.|`|HhDesnNzaa	Many countries in the world have legal prostitution. The theory is that with legalization comes regulation and a greater degree of protection for the prostitutes. There would also be a decrease in STDs if all prostitutes were licensed and required to provide proof of sexual health. In theory, forced prostitution would decrease, as would the victimization of women by pimps.|`|D4Eom8Rpaa	Pros- Less STD's, lower sexual crimes/assaults, lower unwanted pregnancies. <br>  <br>  Cons- Mostly has to do with the family structure and women in general. It could greatly put a strain on a family and a women knowing that the man is paying for prostitutes. <br>  <br>  This is what I learned in Ethics last semester anyways.|`|yv3unx5Eaa	Increase in supply causes a decrease in price which would lead to a hell of a lot more sex. I would assume abortion clinics and orphanages would fill.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	I think that legalizing prostitution would provide a public revenue base through taxation and allow for regulation.  Specifically, workers could be required to get a new operating license each year which would require, for example, medical examinations and perhaps proof of immunizations.  This would help to protect the health of her clients.  I really can't see any cons.  Prostitution truly is the oldest profession and it goes on every night in every city.  If it is between two consenting adults, who cares.  There are women out there who marry men who they don't love because the men are wealthy.  I mean really, what's the difference?  They just have one steady client instead of several.  (And no, I'm not a prostitute and I make more money than both of my ex-husbands put together!)  Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, we are not discussing whether "prostitution" itself is a good thing or a bad thing.  Because it exists whether we like it or not.  The question is whether it should be illegal and therefore on the black market, or whether it should be legalized and regulated.

For some it is, for some it isn't.<br>  <br>  I took the ASVAB twice.  The first time, I didn't study, and did okay on it.  The second time, I got the study guide and practice test, actually used them, and did great on it.<br>  <br>  The thing is, the better you do on the ASVAB, the more jobs you have available, and the more benefits you can get as a result.

Take it to the front end or rear end of her car that takes up your possible parking spot. <br>  If that doesn't work call a bunch of friends and jack it up onto rollers and push it a block away, and every time she does it an extra block away.

If you leave a trap, you can go to jail. If you harass her, you can go to jail. You cannot "box" her car in because she could sue you for damages when you have denied her the use of her car. If it's a public street she has just as much right to park there as anyone else, so you can't FORCE her to do anything.  If you ask her nicely to leave a bit more room for a second car, and she ignores you, just ask again, in writing.   Check with local law enforcement to see if there is some ordinance about taking up more than one space, but that usually only applies at parking meters.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your problem and don't be swayed to do any of the stupid and illegal things suggested by other answerers.

v5SXqxo0aa	It isn't true to say all Republicans are racists. Back during Reconstruction, the period after civil war, the South and the Democratic Party were the bastions for white supremacy. That is no longer true, the South is now mostly Republican and the overwhelming majority of Blacks are Democrats, but there still is that history. Labeling people, no matter what the label, will always cause issues.<br>  <br>  That said, I'm confused as well. Not about the race issue, but that when Obama has never been anything but a Christian, and Jindal was raised Hindu, Obama's immediately called Hussein and a Muslim and Jindal is a Republican champion.<br>  <br>  On the race issue, though, some Obama critics are angry that Obama does not identify with his white half. But Jindal goes by Bobby, and the same critics aren't angry that he's neglecting his heritage.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Nice rant.<br>  <br>  Not all Republicans are racist.<br>  I will support Jindal if he runs in 2012.|`|6AZpu3p0aa	Sure.

Your arguments are, what's a kind way to put this, moronic. The same logic regarding life could be applied to the US use of napalm on innocent civilians in Vietnam, or the deaths of tens thousands of German citizens when the allies blew up entire neighborhoods including schools, and hospitals. Now you'll argue that we were at war, and that is exactly the same logic these terrorists use against us. They believe they are at war and that gives them the right to do what they do.

Bush talked tough about incarcerating the combatants there and if you remember right, democrats tried to get political traction with rumors that Marines were flushing Korans down the toilet. (How in the hell do you get a bible sized book to go down the toilet?) The Marines there are fanatical about executing their jobs professionally and command doesn’t tolerate any violations. Now that Obama has used it as a way to get elected he’s obligated to find another facility to house them.<br>  <br>  I wish him luck with that. <br>  <br>  As far as torture goes I think you might be surprised to know that there is a manual created by DoD which reveals techniques of what kind of procedures would be considered acceptable in gathering information. The only one I am aware of that was being protested by those politicians who visited Cuba was waterboarding Not long after the Abu Ghraib incident all torture SOP was reviewed where the waterboarding method became a political hot topic. <br>  <br>  I hear a lot of people talking about the Marines themselves as they are the ones torturing the prisoners when the Marines are only their handlers. They need to eat, sleep, yard time etc. than the Marines take care of it but CID, NIS, the FBI and CIA are the ones who interrogate them. If Obama disagrees for the former Presidents policies all he needs to do is say so and the policy changes. I have a feeling the urgentness to move them is to suit the hyperbole of what was created before the election. <br>  <br>  And, yes they have forgotten. <br>  <br>  Let some terrorist plant a nuclear device in Washington DC and watch how fast the interrogation policies go back to pre-Abu Ghraib. <br>  <br>  2)If you say everyone is equal, and torture shouldn't be used and that is what sets us ABOVE the 'terrorist scum'... aren't you contradicting yourself?<br>  <br>  The answer to this question is simple. American’s believe everyone has basic human rights but does that mean he should have the right to vote or apply for food stamps? (my attempt at humor) I don’t think so. These people would like nothing more than to destroy this country. Should we just tie our hands so tight that the only way to defend ourselves is to use harsh language? Basic rights? Yes. The rights of every American citizen? Absolutely not.  <br>  <br>  <br>  4) I agree that the extremists are an extremely small percent of the muslim world and that fact has been underpublicised<br>  <br>  If only 10% of Muslims are extremists that means only there are 150 million extremist Muslims. That’s a lot. What’s the body count up to in Iraq?<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Even though Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, those attacks are a kindof symbol of attacks in general, thats why I attempted to invoke the image. And don't tell me that Iraq houses no terrorists- isn't there a war there or something?<br>  <br>  Iraq had violated the terms of surrender. That alone was enough to go back to Iraq. As it was they continued to engage US combat aircraft, eject weapon inspectors, violated 18 UN….bla bla bla….you’ve heard the rest right?<br>  <br>  6) In Rolling Stone, a very liberal magazine btw, there was a short article type thing about how bad Guantanamo was. It specifically talked about several 9/11 conspiritors who were definately detained there.<br>  <br>  I’m sure the report had no preconceived notions about the stories outcome. (eyes roll)<br>  <br>  What do you call people shooting at you wit AK 47's who are not in uniform?<br>  <br>  <br>  Terrorist?<br>  <br>  Thats MY final answer!|`|hLQa3VtYaa	Well first off I don't think everyone detained there was a terrorist. They made plenty of mistakes and held innocent people. Besides that you have plenty of more issues:<br>  <br>  1) False Informaiton: people being tortured so they'll talk will say anything or make up anything for it to stop. The army will waste time and money following up a bunch of false leads.<br>  2)Geneva Convention.... once we take a **** on the Geneva Convention and are no longer abiding by rules of war.. we will subject our own soldiers that get captured to the same type of treatment in future wars.

Violation of allegiance toward one's country or sovereign, especially the betrayal of one's country by waging war against it or by consciously and purposely acting to aid its enemies.<br>  <br>  2. A betrayal of trust or confidence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled, or hanged—Abraham Lincoln, 1863<br>  <br>  Not only did Obama lie to the American people — he has committed a crime.<br>  <br>  Obama may be guilty of treason. He asked that Iraq<br>  delay talking about troop withdrawal until after our election. It appears he was hoping to make it appear that the Bush administration left him such a mess in Iraq, that it would take his entire first term, before he could even think about withdrawing our troops. It is clear that Obama had no intention to end the war for at least 4 more years.<br>  <br>  The New York Post story:<br>  <br>  “WHILE campaigning in public for a speedy withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, Sen. Barack Obama has tried in private to persuade Iraqi leaders to delay an agreement on a draw-down of the American military presence.”<br>  <br>  “According to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, Obama made his demand for delay a key theme of his discussions with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad in July.”<br>  <br>  He asked why we were not prepared to delay an agreement until after the US elections and the formation of a new administration in Washington, Zebari said in an interview.”<br>  <br>  “At this point, it is not yet clear what official American negotiations Senator Obama tried to undermine with Iraqi leaders, but the possibility of such actions is unprecedented. It should be concerning to all that he reportedly urged that the democratically-elected Iraqi government listen to him rather than the US administration in power. If news reports are accurate, this is an egregious act of political interference by a presidential candidate seeking political advantage overseas. Senator Obama needs to reveal what he said to Iraqs Foreign Minister during their closed door meeting. The charge that he sought to delay the withdrawal of Americans from Iraq raises serious questions about Senator Obamas judgment and it demands an explanation.”|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	It's funny how some of these posters say things about the President and starting a civil war and other infantile rantings, don't they realize that thanks to the Patriot Act which allows the government to eaves-drop and investigate anti-american activities they may well already be under surveillance. <br>  <br>  The biggest irony is it was the previous administration, which most of the offenders worship, which enacted the measure that will be their ultimate downfall.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Article III Section 3 US Constitution.<br>  <br>  Has to do with War time acts aiding/abetting the Enemy, etc. as witnessed by two or more people.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Oh, so you mean they found his Hawaiian Certificate of Live Birth and he IS an American citizen after all?|`|b32jC7pGaa	Giving aid and comfort to an enemy during a time of war.|`|P8v8nkqdaa	I think sending American troops into a war of aggression under false pretenses, providing for mass corruption and graft for war-profiteers pretty much fits the bill of treason.

SkOALXv9aa	The first thing that you do upon arrival of a domestic violence call is to listen to see if it is still in progress.  Once inside you look at those involved to see if there are any visible injuries.  You also assess the area to see if there are any weapons that can be used against you or the victim.<br>  <br>  The next step is to separate the two and each officer on the scene will interview the two involved.  To get the story from both prospectives.<br>  <br>  In some cases one will be taking a trip to the lockup.  In still others incidents both may be taken into custody.<br>  <br>  If there is no evidence of violent behavior one of the subjects may be asked if there is somewhere else they can stay for the evening.  Many times a period of time apart and time to think about what started the problem in the first place the pair will resolve the problem on their own.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It should work without much trouble however all to many times the violence can erupt into a more serious situation with officers who were trying to help becoming the ones under attack.

ps5i5gQ1aa	The people who say the crucible are saying that becuase they have never been through SERE training (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training). This simulates survival training and becoming a POW.<br>  <br>  I agree if you have never been to SERE  school the crucible would be the hardest training, but you go through similar events and worse in the fleet.<br>  <br>  Dont need to comment on the battle portion just look at my source<br>  <br>  Here is neet article I found talking about SERE school<br>  <br>  Note: The Marine Corps does not have a single location for SERE Training. The Marines conduct SERE training at various Marine Corps installations throughout the world.<br>  <br>  CAMP GONSALVES, Okinawa, Japan -- In the northern jungles of Okinawa there's a group of individuals stranded, without the aid of food, water, shelter, and the basic necessities required to survive. They are tired, hungry and looking forward to going home at the end of their ordeal.<br>  <br>  This may sound like an episode of "Survivor," and in a sense it is. But instead of contestants, the individuals participating are U.S. Marines and there isn't a million dollar prize at the end. <br>  <br>  Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training (SERE) is held monthly at the Jungle Warfare Training Center at Camp Gonsalves. <br>  <br>  According to Staff Sgt. Clinton J. Thomas, chief instructor at JWTC, the purpose of the course is to teach Marines the skills they need should they become separated from their units in a combat zone and must survive off the land while evading the enemy.<br>  <br>  "We focus more on the survival and evasion portions of the course more so than we do with resistance and escape," the Grand Rapids, Mich. native said. "We teach them enough to survive on their own in the Okinawan jungle. If you can do that, you can survive just about anywhere."<br>  <br>  The 12-day course is broken down into three phases: classroom instruction, survival and evasion.<br>  <br>  During the first three days, Marines are put in a classroom environment where the instructors teach them the basics of survival. They are taught how to identify and catch food, build tools, start fires, and construct shelter.<br>  <br>  The survival phase takes place on a beach where the Marines put the training they received to use by surviving on their own with nothing but a knife, a canteen and the camouflage utility uniforms on their backs for five days.<br>  <br>  The last phase of the course is four days long and the Marines are broken into teams of four to five men. The teams must stay on the move through the muddy and tangled jungle to avoid being captured by students from the man-tracking course. <br>  <br>  "We've built our own POW (prisoner-of-war) camp where we stick the students if they are captured," Thomas said. "They're forced to wear the POW uniforms we made and the instructors interrogate and attempt to pry information from them to test their resistance level. We set them loose after several hours so they don't spend the entire evasion period in the POW camp."<br>  <br>  During their time in the POW camp, Marines are subjected to forced labor such as digging trenches, filling sandbags and cutting wood. They are also put in a small three-foot squared cube-like cell where they are tempted with food to give up information.<br>  <br>  While evading capture, the Marines are given free range to move anywhere they like within JWTC's 20,000-acre training grounds. When evening draws near, they are instructed to find a "safe zone" where the captors are not allowed to enter. If able to reach the safe zone, the students can get five to six hours of sleep per night. If they do not find the zone, they are still subject to capture and may only receive a few hours of sleep if any at all.<br>  <br>  The average student losses between 12-15 pounds while going through the course. During their time in the field they must rely on the nutrition given to them through natural food sources in the jungle such as snakes, insects, fish and plant roots.<br>  <br>  Students participating learn to get through the torment of starvation and weariness by staying motivated and appreciating what they are going through.<br>  <br>  "I thought the survival portion was very interesting," said Lance Cpl. Daniel L. Pendergast, rifleman with 1st battalion, 25th Marine Regiment now assigned to 4th Marine Regiment. "I'm not used to catching my own food and finding or building my own shelter. The course has shown me where my limits are as far as how long I can go without food. Learning how to deal with that is the only tough part."|`|OBnNGcfHaa	The Hardest training I have ever been through was Winter Advanced Mountain Leaders Course (WMLC) in Bridgeport Ca. It was hell on earth. We where in the Serra Nevada's in Feb. at 11,000ft above sea level and it was -15 below. The Shitty thing was they kept taking away our cold weather gear. Ie we started out in 10 men tents with a lil stove and then they took that away. Gave us 4 man tents with no heater. Then they took away our tents all together and we had to dig snow caves.

abJFBd7daa	I noticed a lot of people telling you not to buy a car and I agree but I believe you wanted to what you would "have" to spend money on. Right?<br>  <br>  When I was in (like others have said) your barracks contains all your housing needs, shower, bed, lights and toilet but our washing machine and dryer was coin operated. (I think it was .50 to 1.00) So you may need some money for that. We had to get a haircut about once every other week and I'd guess by now it will be more than 7.50. Uniforms can be an expense as well. I was issued 3 sets of utilities (BDU's) and the rest I had to buy. When I got out I ha 18 sets total cause I was out in the field a lot. If you look around on base you might be able to find a clothing store that specializes in uniforms that might not pass inspection but are good enough for the field, oh and have your inspection utilities dry cleaned and change after inspection so you don't have to buy a new set every month. That goes for your boots too. Keep one set for inspection only. The dress uniforms can be a pain. Buy good shirts and keep the crap they issue as extras. Dress Blues (or whatever the Army calls them) will probably be your expense unless your MOS requires you to wear them.<br>  <br>  Other than that, shoe polish, shaving gear, smoke money and any additional meals (evidently you haven't had to eaten in the chow hall) are pretty much it. You can save money if you discipline yourself but extras will cost you. Laptops, music, ipod, nights out on the town etc <br>  <br>  About the only advice I can think to add is don't wait much more than a year (on a 4 year enlistment) to buy a car. A bank on base should have better rates than a bank ff base and will be less inclined to loan you money that you won't be able to pay back before your enlistments up. Even better if you can wait that long, like that other guy said, buy a cheap piece of sh*t and get around in that for the first 4 years and when you reenlist you'll be able to take out a bigger loan and get the car you want.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	yes you will have to spend money.<br>  <br>  Think about it, you live at home, your parents provide you with food.<br>  <br>  Now, just how much added spending do you do or your parents do for you ?<br>  <br>  Clothes, music, fast food, movies, dates, car. insurance, beer, partying<br>  <br>  Don't buy a car before enlisting, if you don't have one yet.<br>  <br>  If you get sent to korea or japan as your first duty station, <br>  <br>  You cannot take it with you.<br>  <br>  Just wait until you out of training and at your first duty station to buy a car.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	single, live in the barracks.  eat in the mess hall.  think you can save most of your check.|`|9rEI0TnUaa	Don't get a vehicle before you join.  Trust me.  <br>  <br>  No, you do not have to spend you paycheck.  Its best to save it.  Far too many junior enlisteds spend $40K on a pickup truck and then b**** that they don't have enough money.  <br>  <br>  Instead, get the cheapest piece of junk that runs and save your money.  In two or three years you'll be able to buy your dream ride with CASH.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Generally as an enlisted soldier living in the barracks you can keep your out of pocket expenses quite low.

McRQKiVdaa	Yes, I have felt for some time that drugs should be made legal. They need to be controlled and more should be spent on education. Prohibition didn't work and neither is the so called war on drugs. I feel there would be fewer over doses if people new what they were getting rather than 'cut and pure' risk that they now take. Just as drinking is changing with education and social persuasion. With emphasis on doing it responsibly, so could drug usage. People should be taught that being under the influence around children is unacceptable, giving it to minors is unacceptable and doing it while pregnant is unacceptable. It is much easier to tolerate what people do in privacy when they are not in dangering others etc. Doe's the government try to protect the obese food junkie from them self? Do they not pose a risk  with their obesity habits to their children? It should be about education and tolerance not the government telling a person what they can and can't put into their own body. Most crimes connected with drugs would vanish if they were legal. They could be taxed and funds gained used for control and education. If the spill over from Mexico gets worse I think you might see more social retooling on the matter in the US.|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	I think most illegal drugs should be illegal. They turn people into addicts, changes their personalities and too many people become criminals because of them. I don't mean the people who sell them, or sneak them into the country, they are already criminals. I'm talking about innocent people who become addicted, will do anything they have to to get money to buy them, like steal, rob other people and in general ruin their lives.<br>  <br>  The only illegal drug, in my opinion, that doesn't fit into this category is marijuana. It's far less dangerous than alcohol, that turn people into alcoholics, killers when they drive drunk and ruin so many people's lives, no different than hard core illegal drugs. It's just another make no sense governmental thing. If the government legalized marijuana, which i think is harmless, regulated it like they do alcohol, taxed it, etc., we'd come out of this recession in no time. Unfortunately, up until now we've had a government with Victorian minds. Maybe this too will change.|`|v1Y3dvjgaa	The bad effects are the reason they were made illegal. They were not always.

AA10553624	Decriminalized, yes.  Legalize, no.  Legalizing it would put the government into it more than now and the whole idea is to get them out of it.  When alcohol was legalized, the crime rates went down as did the amount of people doing it,  Most of the drug use is because of the idea of doing something that should not be done.  No deaths have ever been directly related to marijuana, nor is there anything besides what you see on t.v. propaganda proven about it leading to harder drugs.  Also, it has been a proven cancer inhibitor for decades now.   Besides, it is just a plant.  God put it here for a reason.  Meth is a drug, along with crack and heroine.  These need to be kept illegal, but not criminalized to the extent they are now.|`|2nz0oB35aa	well, there are some pros and cons:<br>  <br>  Yes:<br>  The drug generally isn't more harmful than alcohol or tobacco if used in moderation. <br>  Limiting the use of the drug intrudes on personal freedom. <br>  Legalization would mean a lower price; thus, related crimes (like theft) would be reduced. <br>  There are medical benefits such as the those for cancer patients. <br>  Street justice related to drug disputes would be reduced. <br>  It could be a source of additional tax revenues. <br>  Police and court resources would be freed up for more serious crimes. <br>  Drug dealers (including some terrorists) would lose most or all of their business. <br>  The FDA or others could regulate the quality and safety of drugs. <br>  Like sex, alcohol, or cigarettes, marijuana is one of life's little pleasures for some people. <br>  Drug busts often trap young people in a flawed system that turns them into lifelong criminals.<br>  <br>  <br>  No:<br>  Marijuana is often used as a stepping-stone drug, leading to heroin, cocaine, or other harder drugs. <br>  Stoned driving and other dangers would be increased. <br>  Some consider use of the drug as morally wrong. <br>  Legalization would increase the chances of the drug falling into the hands of kids. <br>  Because of drug-related arrests, people who have committed or are likely to commit more serious crimes can be taken off the streets. <br>  Physical damage would be done to users that abuse the drug. <br>  More widespread use would increase the dangers of secondhand smoke-damage to bystanders. <br>  <br>  Overall, I would give a very cautious yes, but there has to be many limits, or several civilians will begin to overuse this drug.|`|ouB59I1Laa	It shouldnt be legal for one good reason.1.If you take the rug out from under the bootleggers what will they smuggle in next?Bombs.|`|VGOACuKGaa	for sure, it's a much safer substitute to relax with than alcohol|`|iXX0QzvXaa	Absabloodylutely!!!|`|SsfnitjXaa	I wouldn't bug me.

Pot has never been linked to any deaths and it is basically impossible to OD on it like it is with other hard drugs, or with alcohol for that matter. It should be a personal choice just like drinking and smoking is now which are both worse than pot smoking. If you love in CA you should push for the bill, if these types of bills are going to be laws they need the people to back them, which by the way we are getting closer and closer to 50% approval in the US to legalize pot.|`|86dfa6586c37235c916f6cbb00277efdaa	Yes and by a plan that is being discussed in CA. taxed at $50 per ounce.

Unfortunately, they refuse to actually look at the facts.<br>  Oh, it was Sean Hannity....figures: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200807110005" rel="nofollow">http://mediamatters.org/items/2008071100...</a>|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I don;t have any dumb friends like that but I sure see it enough. I cant't imagine being around these nutjobs in my daily life. My bro-in-law once said that Bush kept us safe...he lives far away & is a real goober but I yelled "What, he kept us safe!!! 911 happened on his watch". I am like a shark & he a goldfish so I don't try to demolish him but there is no way I could be around people like that.
zyw4i3kRaa	Yes I know of the occult interpretation of history  quite well<br>  its been hidden in plain sight so we forget our roots & assume what we can touch taste, smell see is the only thing that's real,  a labyrinth of hidden & often useful factoids that most people won't touch with a 10 meter cattle prod due sadly to our conditioning to disregard subjects like this & only investigate socially sanctioned ideas of history & daily existence, such as the capitalism,Left/Right Hegelian divide, feminism, rational science, all the appropriate (i.e. limited) lenses. <br>   Most people think it insane at best even though many things line up, including the push for globalism which was the 'Illuminati' stated plan from the very beginning. Its no less authoritative a version of events to me than the official timeline & reading of modern life which has just landed us in yet another world wide crisis & depression, so I have to ask who really has a grasp on sanity here?<br>  At least the Freemason/occult memes take into account the very real possibility of conspiracy which has been disregarded by the mainstream in its never ending quest to dumb people down. They key is not to lose sight of officialdom & the 'real' (har har) world either. They all coexist at once so keeping informed on many possible fronts does give you a leg up sometimes, just don't get swallowed up by any one either :P<br>  <br>  Fiction is Reality & vice versa; It would be nice if people would see that, its how we believe in Yellowcake & WMDs, if the lie is big enough we will make it tangible, all a mass of ideas vying for dominance.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	"Ground control to Major Tool......"|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Well then England can start bailing out the USA.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	By way, not all the paperwork was burned in the War of 1812 when the British burned down the White House.

Percent wise firearm deaths for under 18 years olds is about .005% of all deaths in this age groups.  Even one death is one too many, but to exaggerate the number and diminish the percent is cherry picking.  Also, a good many of these deaths have to do with children in neighborhoods that have a massive drug and gang problem.  It's not a general all over every part of every town problem...it's specific.  To get the right answer you have to ask the right question.  The question is what to do about gun toting gangsters, not firearms owned by responsible American citizens.  Give it a think!

And it seems to be true:<br>  <br>  From newsweek:<br>  <br>  "That total is for unspecified high-speed rail projects, and some of it may or may not end up going to a proposed 300-mph "maglev" train connecting Anaheim, Calif., with Las Vegas.""<br>  <br>  "Jindal was lying. There is no provision for mag lev rail, only for high speed rail projects."<br>  <br>  No he wasnt lying. A mag lev rail IS a "high speed rail project". Geez!|`|pGAUjHwvaa	Yeah, I noticed that also although I did not know there was not anything in the bill about Mag-Lev trains.  Anyways, what struck me about his rebuttal was that the Republicans are so bereft of ideas.  The only thing he did was tell some hokey story, nit pick a few of Obama's points and clamor for more tax cuts!  Is this really the best the republicans can offer?|`|ly4INzzTaa	Not one member of congress read the bill before it was signed.

If you're just responding based on cable news pundits, then take the word of President Obama's press secretary Robert Gibbs, who in a post-SotU interview with Keith Olbermann did NOT deny the existence of such a project in the bill.<br>  <br>  Believe me, it helps to watch ALL the networks.|`|98EXXItdaa	Nope.. there's not a dime for it.  Well, except that 8 billion dollars put in for it..  Other than that 8 BILLION dollars, there's not a dime for it.<br>  <br>  But it's only fair I guess.  Afterall, Harry Reid was the one who got the senate to compromise from only 2 billion to 8.. so why shouldn't his district get the pork?|`|xkcLOfTKaa	It is a well established fact that Harry Reid has been trying to get money for this for several years now... it is also a well established (and documented) fact that he has already promised the money going to his state will be used for this... which will leave a lot of private investors high and dry!<br>  <br>  STUDY!|`|5hxWSezPaa	Les, once again, you have outdone yourself.

We may never know, but I am guessing Jindal knows more about what's in it and what was almost in it than either you or I.<br>  <br>  I'm an Indy but here<br>  The deal provides $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, for example, including money that could benefit a controversial proposal for a magnetic-levitation rail line between Disneyland, in California, and Las Vegas, a project favored by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). The 311-mph train could make the trip from Sin City to Tomorrowland in less than two hours, according to backers.<br>  <br>  Just give my $1000 to charity please....|`|6Gfz125Paa	Not trying to defend him, but sometimes the funds don't have to be explicit.  For example, if the stimulus bill provides for funding for transportation that meets certain specifications, and the mag lev train is the only mode of transport meeting those specifications, and the Anaheim-Vegas route is the only one ready for construction, then you can kind of put two and two together and see what's going on.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying this is what happened, because I have no idea.  I'm just saying that sometimes they don't spell out stuff like this in the bill.|`|lr74sHPLaa	havent heard this, it would have already been all over the mainstream media by now if it were true.<br>  <br>  and asking why reps lie so much when Uhhbama is in office, hope you didnt vote for him or your statement would be one big anomaly.
NktvqJhlaa	Please stop buying into the liberal propaganda folks! What exactly is an 'assault weapon'? The weapons that Holder is targeting are not military style automatic weapons. They are handguns..semi-auto pistols..even many hunting rifles that the libs don't like the look of. These are weapons that law abiding citizens have the constitutional right to use to defend their lives and property. Don't be manipulated by this twisted use of language. Make no mistake. Without the right to keep and bear arms you will have no other rights.|`|p2G5KJywaa	Actually the founders of the constitution allowed civilians the right to keep and bear arms. Not just hunting weapons but in fact...we are given the right to own guns necessary to establish a militia if necessary. That means we should be able to possess weapons capable of defending ourselves against a military force. That includes modern military weaponry, not pump shotguns and revolvers.<br>  If you just want to be real particular about it.<br>  <br>  Don't need an assault rifle...300WinMag and a 12x leupold w/ range finder will do. <br>  I don't wanna be that close if it comes to that.<br>  Got the old sawed off real handy for intruders.<br>  <br>  We've already given in too much.

Clinton never had a balanced budget.  To have a balanced budget, you must consider all debts.  They are not including the money that they borrowed from Social Security.  They were relatively close, but never completely balanced.  <br>  <br>  #2 Clinton did not right the appropriations bills.  That was a republican congress (he just signed off on it)<br>  <br>  #3  Obama said he would cut the deficit.  That is not balancing the budget.  If he cuts the deficit to $533b, then he is still borrowing $533b from somewhere.  a Deficit is the amount by which a sum of money falls short of the required or expected amount; a shortage. <br>  <br>  There are 2 ways to lower the deficit<br>        1 Spend less money (Democrats in charge, that won't happen)<br>        2 Tax more.<br>  <br>  would you like to guess which one.

That's a 161% jump from the 2,833 comparable returns filed in 2004. <br>  <br>  Additionally, 4,224 of the over-$200,000 earners reported no worldwide income tax liability on their 2005 returns, the IRS data show. That represents a 75% increase from the 2,420 comparable returns filed in 2004.The data are the most recent available from the IRS. It shows a rising number of high-income earners have avoided the alternative minimum tax, which was intended to ensure that tax shelters, deductions and loopholes wouldn't exempt wealthy Americans from paying at least some federal income tax.<br>  <br>  "It's an interesting case study on how people <br>  find ways to avoid paying taxes," said Howard Gleckman, a senior research associate and tax blog editor at The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The increases stem in part from two tax law changes, according to the IRS Spring 2008 Statistics of Income Bulletin. <br>  <br>  Responding to Hurricane Katrina, Washington exempted charitable contributions between Aug. 27, 2005, and Jan. 1, 2006, from the overall limit on itemized tax deductions and the 50% of adjusted gross income limit for such giving. The <br>  one-time change wasn't limited to hurricane-related contributions. "There was no excuse for not restricting it to the affected area," said Joann <br>  Weiner, a former Treasury Department employee who analyzed the changes in her current job as a contributing editor at Tax Analysts, a non-profit publisher of tax information and data.<br>  <br>  Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Washington also allowed taxpayers to eliminate up to 100% of their alternative minimum tax liability by using credits for any foreign taxes paid. Before tax year 2005, those credits could only eliminate 90% of federal income taxes.|`|vR8bN1n4aa	No lol.

yvPA8FSsaa	It is sheer nonsense.  What we need is to have more than 50% of inner city students graduate high school.  What we need is primary and secondary schools to produce literate students.  What we need is to teach primary and secondary students to be proficient at math.<br>  <br>  The Colleges and Universities are already wasting time and resources teaching incoming freshmen the remedial skills they should have learned before they graduated high school.<br>  <br>  Just as a high school diploma used to actually mean something in American but now is hardly worth the parchment it is printed on, so it is becoming with college degrees.  There was a time when a degree actually meant something.  It was a clear indicator that the person who earned it was truly exceptional.  Few people had them.  Not so now.<br>  <br>  The graduating more and more people from college can only be accomplished by admitting less and less qualified students.  This will have an adverse effect on the degrees' value.  If too many people have a Bachelor's degree, you will have to have at least a Master's degree to be of any value at all.  <br>  <br>  The other adverse effect is the massive increase in tuition it will cause.  Well meaning but out of touch with reality government programs are already handing out massive amounts of grants and loans which only served to increase demand and increase tuition much higher than it would be if the government stayed out of it. Thus making it necessary for more and more student loans and grants.  Now students graduate with massive loan debt.  The dirty little secret is, unless they have a good science, engineering or mathematics degree, they will never earn enough to offset the cost of the education.  <br>  <br>  Liberal arts degrees will probably cost the student more in tuition and loan interest than the difference he will realize in his pay over a lifetime.  In other words, unless you earn substantially more with the degree than you would have without it, it does not pay to get it.<br>  <br>  Do not be fooled!  With colleges or software, the rule is the same.  Garbage in; garbage out.  <br>  <br>  *|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Bad idea.  If everyone's college-educated, the incentive of hiring a college-educated person is eliminated.

I heard that the US already spends more money on education than other nations.    Pay of teachers is partially the problem, but paying sucky teachers isn't going to help either.  Also the way we view education is important too.  Too often education is something that ehhh you don't really need.  I mean look how people praise those who made it big without having a high school education.<br>  <br>  So Obama isn't going to change attitudes, and with his  "Government can help you" and "don't worry the government can take care of you" ideology he has, I doubt it.  Maybe he will have a national grade curve?<br>  _________<br>  So you know, I was shocked that in the Philipines high school students day ends at 4pm; and we end at 1:30 pm.  Try that in US!

This bailout plan will seriously need to work because their won't be jobs for students and if there aren't jobs for students then what will be the incentive for students to go to college taking out these huge amounts in student loans if they know the odds of them actually being able to get a job.

Its key distinction is in international affairs, where it espouses an interventionist approach that seeks to defend what neo-conservatives deem as national interests.

NQacNeTWaa	Many Republicans want to see the country fail under Obama just so they can say "i told you so..." like little children. They expect Americans to believe that what their government under Bush did for the last 8 years will bring us out of this decline when in fact, it is the reason we're in it. Just tax-cuts, and giving corporate America/the rich more money, like you said, won't solve anything, as seen in the past. They fail to acknowledge any wrong on their part and have no answers. Hopefully, some Republican leaders will come around in the future, and try Obama's plan.<br>  <br>  Holbrook Lives!: If you really had a BA in History you would know that FDR helped bring the country OUT of the Great Depression. You say with FDR, the Depression lasted over a decade. But without him, it might have lasted 3 decades. <br>  <br>  Holbrook Lives!:"new stuff" doesn't necessarily mean correct. And i would love to see your proof that "most historians and economists" agree with what you're saying.|`|6B4pnWwMaa	"Republicans have no answers except to give corporate America and the rich more money." This statement is full of so many logical fallacies, it should  not be answered. Please tell me your source of where you pulled the information that republicans give corporate America and the rich more money... and so what if they do...Who is paying most of America's salary? If rich people are making more money, then they are keeping people employed, and there spending that money they make and putting back in the economy. Obam's Plan has some good points to it, I have to say...but Democrat's are saying that the stimulus package is only 2-3% pork. That means we are spending 16-24 billion on pork. That is a lot of pork even it is 2-3%. <br>  This is not a new idea. Communism has been around for quite some time. It doesn't work out to well. Everything is a GREAT IDEA!!! (like communism) ....but does it actually work.|`|XVxH0FFAaa	Obama will make this country tank...that's the problem!|`|ASXeYOjAaa	According to OBAMA, his plan WILL hurt the economy - a LOT. Why do you insist on giving THAT a chance?<br>  Republicans don't "give corporate America and the rich" ANY money. That's just the Democrat LIE used to obfuscate their own contempt for the idea of letting them KEEP any.<br>  Obama has presented exactly ZERO "new" ideas. 100% of his agenda is already tried and proven - to tank economies.<br>  Republicans want to STOP that above other considerations. Their own "ideas," are nothing more than observing what history has long proved to work and giving THOSE things "a chance."<br>  I know, as a Democrat you are pathologically unable to believe this but try. Maybe it will sink in one day: If you look at what has ALREADY been done and do it again, you get the SAME result, not the opposite. Obama and 100% of the Democrat Congressional Caucus claim that's a retarded idea; that if you do the same thing again - THIS time you'll get the opposite result. Democrat fiscal policy has ALWAYS been based on this assumption and still is.|`|c2f7b7e7c197d88a1a3ae7caa8ff6fc2aa	All of Obama's policies are what will tank America. If you are already $12 trillion in debt, you don't get out of debt by going another $6 Trillion in debt. Obama's might stop 3 million jobs from being lost, but it is only temporary. These jobs should not exist and need to be lost to get the economy back into balance. The second Obama stop directly paying for these jobs they will disappear because the market will not support them. So he has only 2 options: let them disappear which will hurt him politically, or continue to rack up debt paying for these artificial jobs, which will hurt him politically.<br>  The Republicans don't have an answer either. The only people with an answer are the libertarians. That answer is to get the government out of the economy entirely since it is unconstitutional. The only thing that can save us is free markets, not government regulations, government spending, and government monopolies.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	People do not want his country to tank at all. <br>  Spending 700 Billion in his first 8 weeks in office is more than Bush spent in 8 years. Over 9,000 earmarks in the "stimulus" and he said he would not tolerate earmarks. Blame it on Bush and the Republicans for as long as possible is not a good strategy. I do not want to be a socialist country with Big Government taxing me and deciding what I should do. Hoover raised taxes (on the wealthy) as soon as he got into office and the country sank deeper into the great depression. Hopefully we can last 4 years.|`|9temsB8haa	That isn't what republicans have to offer in its entirety but corporate tax cuts are important as are tax cuts to those who actually pay taxes and invest in the economy so things like the capital gains tax should be lowered to foster greater investment. <br>  The stimulus bill is filled with pork and that is not beneficial. The CBO is very cynical on the benefits of this bill and the spending that will only increase the debt we leave to our children. It is irresponsible.|`|HpSGw2Fiaa	Since the whole PURPOSE of the Republican party is to give the rich more money, I can't really say that they are wrong in pursuing this course.  They don't really CARE what's best for the country.  They only care what's best for the richest 400 American families.  It's their party (those 400 families) and that's why it exists.  All that other stuff, abortion, gay sex, hating little brown people, all that other stuff is just for show.  The party's about the rich getting richer.  So why should they give Obama a chance?  A chance to do what?  Take their money?  Get real...|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I am coming from a independant perspective, not a Republican one.

Of course I would love it if President Obama had a succesful presidency and the economy recovered.  I would have no problem saying "I was completely wrong, what a fool I was to doubt President Obama"<br>  The fact of the matter is his plan sucks.

It has ALWAYS worked.  <br>  <br>  From the first year colonists came to America to the growth years created by Ronald Reagan.

But over taxing one person and not taxing another at all to 'spread the wealth' leads to socialism. Socialism ALWAYS leads to fascism and/or communism.

You see your problem is that you just cannot seem to realize the simple fact that Obama's ideas are not new. They have been tried not only in this country, but others as well and have failed in every instance. The Republicans are not proposing giving money to the rich or corporate America. They are proposing that Americans be allowed to keep more of their money and spend it as they deem fit, not based on the government perception of how it should be spent. It is not I who desires the failure of this country, it is Obama who insists on following a failed ideology. I will not willingly go along regardless of how many Democrats try uselessly to shame me into it.

When history proves it does not work.<br>  <br>  This is the answer right here buddy. You are the typical liberal just like Obama with the motto "Just shut up and do what we say". Look at Obama, up there preaching doom and gloom every single day....until now. See, he has his ENORMOUS government spending package so now it's all roses.

California is also cutting down for colleges such as UCs and CSUs, including their classes as well as the numbers of acceptance.

wfayqpHjaa	In answer to your first question - in most UK police forces you will need to spend the first two years in uniform "on the beat" (although there are sometimes exceptions). Once your probation has been completed you can then transfer to CID. Once you've done the courses and taken the exams you can become an accredited detective. What you wear will depend on the type of work you get into - investigation, undercover operations, public protection work and so on - what you wear will depend on what you end up doing.<br>  There are lots of books available on getting the job, but probably best to contact you local force and see if the run any sort of introduction day which may help - or find a freindly officer to talk to !<br>  <br>  Good luck - although if your only question is about what you will wear - this may not be the job for you !|`|AA11705909	The CID are in plain clothes.

uvWH4Ioyaa	If you're in the US, you want to tell them they are not under arrest and that they're free to leave at any time. If it's non-custodial interrogation, you do not need to tell them they have a right to remain silent and they have a right to a lawyer. Then you tell them you just need them to explain what happened. You want to get their side of the story. You should not tell them very much of what happened or any details. Just set the scene or describe in the most general terms what information you want.  Make it seem like you have the power or authority to let them go free and that they will not be arrested if they level with you.  When they explain things, you should ask open ended questions about details. Never use leading questions.  Ask them who else was there, where they live, how long they were there? What did the suspect say or do. What did the other(s) say or do. After they confess, then you can arrest them.  If you're in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India or the UK, you will need to check with a local attorney or police officer.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Think of a pyramid.

Booth: "I assume you know why you're here."<br>  Smith: "I kind of have an idea, but I'm not sure."<br>  Sgt. Booth: "Well, you're here because we have reason to believe you were involved in a certain murder. Where were you between 9:00 P.M. March 3 and 2:00 A.M. March 4?"<br>  Smith: "Well, sergeant, for most of that night, I was online. Actually, I didn't log on until 10. I was watching "Law & Order" from 9 til 10. And my computer's history could back that up, 'cause I didn't bother deleting anything." <br>  Sgt. Booth: (Sucks cheeks in, nods knowingly.) "We'll check that.

In the real world most confessions come because most people want to tell the truth and have a clear conscience.

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	In order to have the right of control over your mother's affairs, you would need to become her "conservator."  Without that, you have no rights into her business, whether or not she allows someone else to control her affairs.<br>  <br>  In order to be declared her conservator, your mother would have to be found "incompetent," so be sure and discuss this with her, and assure her you have her best interests at heart.<br>  <br>  I have some experience with this type of case, so I feel it only fair to warn you that if schizophrenia is your mother's only disability, and she takes her meds, she most likely cannot be found incompetent.

If she is judged incompetent, then the court still has authority UNLESS a family member is appointed. Since she is an adult.. you don't have any automatic rights. <br>  The standard is that any adult (even the mentally ill) have the right to make choices, as to who they want to have information, or control. This means.. UNLESS SHE GIVES CONSENT, the hospital, etc, cannot give anyone information, or decisions. <br>  The way to change that is to go to court and petition to be guardian/ conservator. That means the court admits she is unable to make good decisions, or choices, and allows you to have those rights. If she was under conservator before and history of mental illness, then you already have record that she is probably incompetent. <br>  The state notifying you is something that she probably gave consent to..but she could withold that consent, and the law says they have to honor it..unless you have court orders, saying otherwise.|`|A1IisrUraa	You definately should have some legal rights.

I never shaved on weekends or on days when I didn't have to work. I think it's a retarded rule, and I hated it.  I also think The Professor up there needs to shut his mouth.

Wow, would never have guessed.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I am not sure about the "rule" anymore, but when I was in you could not go off base not shave and any shirt you wore had a collar and a front pocket. You are a marine 24/7 and they expect more from you in dress and appearance and action. What your husband received is probably defensable and i would talk to JAG about it!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	It is the prerogative of the Base Commander or even the Commandant to require all Marines leaving or entering the base the be properly shaven regardless of dress.

EnODJeIcaa	James Madison was the "Father of the Constitution" and he was critical member of the Framers who wrote and fought for it's ratification.<br>  <br>  One of the interesting thins about James Madison is that he opposed the "Bill of Rights" as part of the constitution but Patrick Henry and others would not ratify it with out such...Madison in turn oversaw the creation of the Bill of Rights but stated that he feared the enumeration of certain rights would alienate other rights not stated. This has become the case in the modern world and leads to constant legal wrangling over free speech.<br>  <br>  Early on in his career he believed soley in the rights of the states...did not want a strong centralized government and opposed a standing army...He fought along side Thomas Jefferson as one of the first leaders of the Democrat-Republican party that was formed in opposition to Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists.<br>  <br>  He however as he won the Presidency ended up taking America to war with England in the was of 1812. He as he grew older appreciated the need for a federal army and due to the war felt the need for a strong central government...But he never stopped fighting for the rights of the states over the rights of the government....One of his last acts as President was to veto a bill for the Federal government to tax and build roads and bridges....He felt that congress was taking too much control from the states and wanted to leave those powers to the states.<br>  <br>  He was ironically enough one of the founders of the democratic party of today...but his life's work could best be summed up as a politician fighting for the rights of the individual and the states and limited federal government.

If the Republicans continue to tow the Conservative social agenda they will be in the muck for quite some time.|`|NwBfuUNaaa	This is history repeating it self. Roosevelt trounced on Hover and the Republicans for all this same stuff that caused a severe depression then and it took The Republicans 20 years to gain the White House and 40 years to gain back congress.

In a few more years it will become more obvious.<br>  They are trying so desperately to cause Obama to fail, yet they have no plan, just the fear of the bogeyman and oppose any tax increase and any spending of any kind. People will reelect Obama even if some programs don't make it, just because he is trying.

A couple of things to bear in mind, you need a reason to seek emancipation, disliking your mother, or her rules is not sufficient reason, not sure what the entire story is, she left you at one point, but is back now.<br>  <br>  You will have to go to court, and you should give serious consideration to hiring an attorney.<br>  <br>  Check the condition of the survivors benefits, make sure they don't cancel out if you get emancipated. One of the things you have to be able to prove to the judge is that you can financially care for yourself, and if you are banking on 1500.00 a month that will go away as soon as you are emancipated, then you won't be able to use that.<br>  <br>  Consult with an attorney, if you don't the mistakes you make could cause the whole thing to be drug out until your 18th birthday.|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	In order to be emancipated in Nevada, you must not reside with either parent.  (Living in a dorm only counts if your mother isn't paying any of the expenses.)<br>  <br>  Survivor's benefits from Social Security will (but only) continue until you turn eighteen.  You would gain control of the account at emancipation.<br>  <br>  If your mother objects, you will need a very good argument in your favor, and it will probably require an attorney to prevail.  (Expect that to cost at least $1,000.)  But, you can always just pick up the documents to file a motion at your local county courthouse, and ask then about the going filing fee.  You would have to attend a hearing in family court.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	You will have to go to court but I expect because you are going to college and you have a source of income, that the court will "probably" grant you emancipation (don't forget to mention your mother's previous abandonment of you...you may have to document it).  I suspect that your mother wants to retain custody over you for the money.  She will have to give you access to the money if you obtain emancipation so expect a fight on your hands.<br>  <br>  The link below will give you some guidance on the appropriate legal statutes.  The second link is the actual Nevada statute. Ask your school advisor to help you fill in the appropriate forms.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA12109395	Let me start by saying, it appeared the the officers received info that your son either possessed a very large quantity of marijuana on hand or that he was distributing marijuana. Breaking down the door was excessive.<br>  <br>  They only have to read a person their rights if they intend to ask them questions. <br>  <br>   I would raise some serious questions of the Chief of Police, and the judge/Magistrate who would have had to sign that search warrant for it to be legal.<br>  <br>  In order to get to the bottom of this, you need to know exactly what info was in that warrant to make a judge conclude there was probable cause for the search and the necessity for executing what is called a "no knock search warrant" (breaking the door down).<br>  <br>  Search warrants are very specific, give an address of the subject, and tell exactly what they are searching for. The fact that they did not search his person or his entire house indicates something is very wrong with this process.<br>  <br>  Obtain an attorney, who can find out exactly what was in that search warrant, get the police procedures/conditions for a "no knock" warrant and go from there. <br>  <br>  When there are procedural errors in the warrant process or police procedures, occasionally, judges will render all evidence obtained inadmissible and dismiss the case. Your attorney, after looking over the whole picture will be able to tell you where you stand on your son's case and possibly a civil suit.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	You only have to be read your rights when you are being questioned.  If you are not read your rights, it doesn't mean the charges against you are dropped, it just means the testimony you gave is not admissible in court.  If there are other ways of finding you guilty then they can do so.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter why the DEA was brought out..  if it is a hicktown in southwest Missouri, and not Springfield, Willard, Nixa, Ozark, Republic or Branson, more than likely the DEA came in because the local police couldn't handle it.<br>  <br>  He should just pay the tickets because he's not going to be able to get off from paying them.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Serious issues here. First of all how was the warrant issued? On probably cause? If so, who swore it out and what "reliable" information did they rely on to obtain it?<br>  <br>  Then, there's the issue of who actually possessed the weed and bong? If its some college student that doesn't live there, then its arguable that he's not the target.<br>  <br>  Finally, if he wasn't read his rights, then anything he said cannot be used against him in court. But anything the cops found on a "good faith" warrant, is admissible, but of course that again depends on whether the warrant was properly issued and the cops acted in good faith.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me someone snitched and made it look a lot worse than it really was.|`|Vrs3mid6aa	Miranda warning is read when interrogated, not when an inanimate object is investigated.<br>  <br>  It really depends on WHEN police speak with a suspect. Miranda warning omissions are not always necessary to deam a statement inadmissable (i.e.excited utterances) TV shows ALWAYS portray cops mirandizing subjects immediately after arrest but, that is not necessarily always the case. Honestly, if they had enough probable cause to obtain a search warrant and found evidence BEFORE interrogating him, then dont need a statement because they have what they need, therefore, he can not incriminate himself (unless he starts speaking about another crime).<br>  <br>  It all really depends on the situation. Frankly, you have not provided enough details for anyone to give you an accurate and diffinaitve answer. Therefore any yes/no answers given will be inaccurate. You certainly have the right to fight it however, speak with an attorney first - even if it is just the public defender.<br>  <br>  P.S. 6 officers from the local PD hardly qualify as being searched by the DEA.|`|e4d4973d2102e2d3e8df7315d71f4644aa	Miranda rights relate only to the use of statements the defendant might have made that incriminate him. If they don't try to use any admissions or statements from him, then there is no Miranda violation. Whether the search is legal is another question and you haven't provided enough facts to determine it's constitutionality.  The warrant has to be valid and to have been obtained properly. The search must then be consistent with the warrant's authorization and be limited to the warrants parameters.
DFaMY7Aaaa	Yes. I have PTSD. I still have daily flashbacks , panic attacks , and wake up most every night screaming 6 years after my initial trauma. <br>  <br>  When I smoke grass , I am able to relax fully.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Yes, it can be taxed to stimulate the economy! They make 50 billion alone per year in pot sales!|`|t7LlAmZnaa	I think that it could be good for the economy and for the general morale of millions across America. The government spends so much time, money and energy on enforcing strict and unnecessary drug laws. There are more important things to worry about.|`|s30Duwdraa	California is trying because it will get them out of debt.  Legalizing it is one of the best ways to make money for any state.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the revenue from the munchies!!|`|gYNDNXAkaa	I don't do pot or any drugs, but the fact that 40%+ of our prison population is non-violent drug offenders (most for pot) is ridiculous.  Get them out of the prisons and free it up for real criminals like killers.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	no it should not be legal. i doubt that calif will do it and hopefully they wont'. it would really be harmful to the public if they do.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	I think when the government figures out how to tax it or make some sort of profit off of it then they will absolutely legalize it.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	The extra revenue would be nice but it would further deepen the divide between conservative and liberals in California (or shall we say between the city population and the country population). Also, unfortunately it would create a run to marijuana by people from all over the country where marijuana is not legal. Is there a border patrol to keep the marijuana grown and consumed in the state of California from being exported illegally by people from out of state?<br>  I'm thinking that it's hard not to assume that if marijuana growing is to be legalized in California by farmers just like any other cash crop, that they would drop food growing immediately in favor of marijuana growing, because it would be some fast money and much more lucrative in the long run. Would then the state/fed be forced to give even more grants to farmers to keep them from growing marijuana so the food production would be maintained?<br>  <br>  Or are we talking massive importation from abroad?<br>  In that case, and since marijuana is still a controlled substance under federal law, California would be an enabler of the importation of a prohibited substance and a state sponsor of drug traffic. If it's illegal to grow in the US and everywhere else in the world, then it would be harvested by drug lords somewhere and the problem continues. <br>  <br>  Just the simple de-criminalization of smoking and owning small amounts of pot would be ok because of all of this. I don't believe in imprisoning anybody for such a petty crime that eats away at the resources available to go after some heroin/meth/coke big fish. <br>  <br>  I see no other alternative than to seceede from the Union and create the independent country of California if it wishes to completely legalize marijuana.|`|G7SiH0ohaa	I'd like it to be legalized, it could be taxed and it would bring in huge revenue. There would be less illegal drug sales if the government can keep the prices higher that whats on the illegal market.<br>  <br>  Pot is less harmful than alcohol, cigarettes, and cigars, so why can't it be legalized? But like every other drug, it should be used in moderation.|`|5OhMq3N2aa	Alcohol has wrecked more lives than pot ever will. Problem here is that if it is legal(which it should be) How do you stop the basement pot growers. That is the market the government can't compete with. They found out how to tax booze but growing weed is easier than it is to still booze. Pot will never be legal but it is not on some moral issue, Gov't doesn't care what you poison yourself with as long as they can make a buck off of it. I grow killer weed in my house and the gov couldn't do it better because I have been doing it for 25 years now.But yeah , it should be legal.|`|9cpKYneZaa	I think all drugs should be legalized. You should be able to walk into your local pharmacy without any prescription whatsoever and get whatever it is that floats your boat.<br>  <br>  That eliminates (1) high prices and (2) crime.|`|GqJVk2kYaa	California is the only state that is truly broke.  State employees rarely lose their jobs.  In California 20,000 of them are about to be laid off....a state of disrepair.|`|S6zEIEZXaa	Yes I do and I think it will bring much needed revenue to our struggling economy. Also, pot is no worse than alcohol; people die and cause accidents that kill thousands of people a year!|`|zmab07Giaa	Many government officials would be out of jobs if pot was legalized, that is the only reason why it is illegal|`|fBvhkalFaa	For the 1000th time.  No I don't.|`|LA2nJToYaa	Not for awhile. Decriminalization is the first step for frist time offenders but not full blown legalization. Maybe in 50-100 years it MAY happen...but probably not anytime soon. The DEA makes a heck of a lot of money off of Cannabis alone and right now as you know the government needs all the money it can get. So don't be looking for weed at your local 7-11 anytime soon...instead just save up for a trip to Amsterdam!|`|9yoGMz3taa	God, I hope not.<br>  <br>  Dr*gs are illegal for a reason, and if California legalizes this Ab*mination, I may very well have to leave the state.|`|Jjw4Ma9Iaa	Peace.<br>  <br>  Btw, major tabacco company's have special "Gold Packs" ready to be shipped if the law ever passes.|`|qC9pcfP5aa	It's pretty silly that marijuana is illegal considering caffeine is more dangerous.|`|PpGCchNPaa	"They"...potheads...Have been trying to legalize it for years probably at least 30 yrs and nothing so don`t hold ur smoke errr...I mean breath.|`|CcEOxn4Maa	definitly. its no worse than alcohol and tobacco
PtRmhxU9aa	Columbus just hired 26 new Police officers as a direct result of the stimulus package for Ohio - we all just benefited.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Bush's "stimulus" actually cost $850,000,000,000 and he did send out checks to 130,000,000 Americans so I imagine there was some benefit there. The rest went to banks and financial institutions and they did nothing useful with the funds (except for themselves). In fact, things only got worse after he did that.<br>  The current bill is less ($780,000,000,000) and will be spent for government projects that probably won't effect anybody.|`|AA11972206	The rush to pass this was because it was so huge, few if any, read it before they voted. The stimulus turned out to be a lot of pet projects for the congressman/woman. So it is hypricritical at best. If they had dropped the taxes for low, middle income and corporations and small businesses, the employment rate would've gone up. I know how you feel, I am sick over this.|`|qC9pcfP5aa	You have and I have. 1/3 of the recent stimulus package was tax cuts and you received them unless you dodge your fair share of taxes.|`|xnB0NVsbaa	We will all get a whopping 8 bucks a week that won't be paid into taxes starting in April. I am personally going to get the $8000 back for buying a home though.|`|otYOxmnuaa	No -- if you read the CBO report, you'd realize not much of the spending goes into effect until 2010.<br>  <br>  So what was the rush?

However, in order to adjust your status you must currently be in a legal status.  If you have no legal status you have nothing that you can adjust from.  This has effectively closed the marriage loophole.  In order to come here legally she is going to need to leave the country and apply for a fiancee visa.|`|AA11565538	The first step is getting married.<br>  Second, they will have to send the following forms to the USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Center):<br>  I-130 Petition of Relative (form signed by your friend petitioning his wife) Fee: $355<br>  I-485 Adjust Status (this form is sent because when a person is married to a US citizen he/she have first priority) Fee: $1,010 (including the fingerprint fee)<br>  G-325 Biographic Information (for each) Fee: none<br>  I-864 Affidavit of Suppport (to show that the applying immigrant has enough financial support without requiring US government welfare) Fee: $70<br>  I-710 Employment Authorization Fee: when filed along with I-485 you don't need to pay the fee for this form. <br>  Your friend will need to send a copy of his birth certificate, the wife will need a copy of her birth certificate, passport if she has one.<br>  Your friend will need to show that he can support his wife by showing his last 3 tax returns and determining the minimum income requirement needed to complete I-864 (you will need to check that on the form I-864P. <br>  You can find all the forms on www.uscis.gov and each form comes with instructions. If you have further information you can call USCIS at 1800-375-5283 they will answer all your questions with no problem.<br>  Even though she came legally to the US as a tourist, she has an illegal status but she can still do all this paperwork in the USA. If she entered the USA illegally then she would have to go back to her country of origin to process this and/or pay a penalty (you have to double check this second situation). Feel free to call the USCIS, they very helpful.|`|OEhH9hcvaa	well your friend is smart because one thing you should never do in this country is marry an American woman..!!!
FMMWq3kaaa	To all the answerers who are asserting that adultery is not illegal: It IS illegal if it is committed by a US Military servicemember (not under criminal civilian law, but under the UCMJ). That's why the asker is even asking this question.<br>  <br>  However, this soldier has no proof that you have committed adultery. He has proof that you had his wife on your lap and kissed her, but that is not actually adultery. Get your copy of the UCMJ and read over the article that mentions it and see if the situation fits. I doubt that it does. Of course, if his wife admits under oath that you and she have had actual sexual relations, then you might be in a bit of trouble then.|`|e4d4973d2102e2d3e8df7315d71f4644aa	A kiss is not adultery. Adultery is no longer illegal in most states. He might try to sue you for alienation of affection, but he wouldn't win that over a kiss. He won't find a lawyer to represent him. If this is a matter of military law, I don't know.  They could have some special regulations, but it's still not adultery.  If you're not in the Army, they won't have any jurisdiction over you anyway|`|DP0AjzJ2aa	It won't get anywhere.  First, he has to have proof that his wife cheated on him.  2nd, kissing someone isn't a crime.  If you were making out, he'd probably beat the crap out of you.  No DA would even touch this case.  It's basically him blowing off steam.  Adultery is usually one of the reasons people use in divorce court, not criminal court.<br>  <br>  He said she said won't hold up in court unless the friends actually were there or witnessed it.  If they were legally separated and going through the divorce already, it's too late for him to bring it up.  Don't even worry about it.|`|ouB59I1Laa	not far|`|2nz0oB35aa	Well, it depends on how good his lawyer is, as there are several ridiculous things that people can sue for and win and it also depends on what the picture contains. But if this is all of the evidence that he has, then there is a big chance that he won't be able to get very far.|`|VGOACuKGaa	that's a joke there's nothing to worry about there, who ever heard of adultery charges we are all grown people out here in the real world, no worries brother|`|SsfnitjXaa	Are you in the Army also?  Adultery can only be committed by married people.  If you are married, why would he care if you committed adultery against your wife?|`|AA11280073	Forget about it. He has no case.

2BWyZOy5aa	It'll be the lower 95% that will really be hurt by these tax increases.  The "rich" will just pull even more of their money out of the economy which will increase unemployment in return.|`|crbDVI29aa	The thing with percentages is that they're a reflection of real numbers, but not real numbers themselves. In other words, which weighs more: half a pound or half a ton? They're both 50%, right?<br>  <br>  The number of people in the upper 2% (not 5, by the way) is getting smaller and smaller. And as that number declines, the actual raw amount of their wealth is going down, also.<br>  <br>  Obama is going fishing in a pond that is drying up. It hardly matters if he catches 2% of the remaining fish or not, does it?|`|BwrGcTosaa	Given the attitudes, you would think that most here are millionaires.  They gripe about things that probably they will benefit from.  They seem to forget that the rich have more loopholes, more offshore accounts, and more capital gains that AREN'T taxed. They are just mindless shills that listen to Rush, Bill and Shawn (who are rich and are using these fools for THEIR own puppets.)  Try thinking rationally people, and for yourself. <br>  <br>  Funny, they didn't gripe about giving trillions to bankers that used it on BONUSES, $10 million dollar Super Bowl parties, million dollar office makeovers, and private jets, but they scream bloody murder about the idea of raising the TAXES of these people. <br>  <br>  This pillage of Americans make me very angry - ALL of it.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Someone who is in a position to earn big bucks, is also in a position to increase his demands, to make up for increased expenses.<br>  <br>      In the end, the customer pays all costs. More taxes just mean more resources devoted to govt. waste.|`|vIHHQX3caa	You know how if you repeat a lie over and over-people may start to believe it? This really touches on the underlying issue here. It is called class warfare and control. Republican conservatives want their people in office so they can keep their tax cuts and gain more wealth. The crying really starts when someone suggests they should pay their fair share of taxes. All that Obama is doing is reversing the tax cuts Bush has enacted for the last eight years.|`|AA10652652	The increase is suppose to total $318 billion or so over 10 years.  That's a lot of maids they aren't going to hire and jets they aren't going to buy.  The deficit for 2009 before the economy went bad was suppose to be $407 billion alone.  Chances are that $318 billion will end up paying for bonds and not trickle down to U.S. citizens.  Also those cuts are suppose to total over $1 trillion so even when Obama increased spending, he decreased taxes.

I do know that sometimes food chains and things like that will set up little places on base with that kind of food for the troops to eat but I don't really know how often it happens. A good friend of mine in the Navy that is stationed on a ship that transports soldiers has said that it isn't even in all areas that that happens, also. <br>  <br>  They absolutely do deserve better.

Hey maybe we can give them some tarp money and they can charge stuff like the banker and finacial guys that got the firtst bailout money were charging the hookers on their company credit cards.  Yea we can give them credit cards and they can charge the star Bucks.  With so many clsoed I bet they would open one there or have Haliberton do it and the end cost per cup would be $210.

yprHJNHAaa	Fox is totally republican! Hannity is so like Limbaugh.  O'Reilly is an extreme republican. Geraldo Riviera may be the most moderate on Fox.  <br>  <br>  As to CNN...AC Cooper is pretty even...Don Lemon in the morning has a good show with both Dems and Repubs.  I really don't like that Brown woman..she soured me during the elections.<br>  <br>  MSNBC....Joe in the morning is republican.  Keith Olberman's show is pretty good.  He shows the antics of Limbaugh, Hannity and O'Reilly.  <br>  <br>  I don't think there is any one news channel that fits it all.  Fox is about the worst.  If you like drama, screaming, yelling and outlandish conspiracy theories against the Dems, Fox is the channel.  <br>   <br>  I would say Andersen Cooper is about the best on CNN.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, Fox is the Vocal Republican Propaganda Machine!|`|CvFajKPUaa	the Clinton News Network?  common, just because you have extreme views doesn't make them bias|`|2gx2LgzEaa	ROFLMAO...<br>  <br>  CNN on the RIGHT????<br>  <br>  Your joking right? wow, you RERALLY dont watch the news much do you.<br>  <br>  And let me guess..

May Goodness!|`|yeu09pfOaa	uhh.... no its not|`|lUd5dj2haa	I've found CNN to be on the liberal side even though they try to be fair. They have the no bull, no bias thing or whatever. Fox news also claims to be fair and balanced but neither of them are. Fox is definitely a conservative channel. They both try though by getting input from guests that are both liberal and conservative. If you just want straight liberal news watch nbc. I prefer a mix but fox is my fav. Watching it right now!|`|KTM5JEkLaa	You're kidding right?  CNN?  The Communist News Network?

v5SXqxo0aa	1. No, not really. If all the politicians suddenly went, "You know what? We're good." and shook hands, I would be scared of corruption. Or, if you meant the populace, that would mean that everyone had begun to think alike, or that communism was taking over. I would be scared for democracy.<br>  <br>  2. I can't speak for everyone, but as for myself I trust until I find my trust has been betrayed. That happened with Bush. I do not easily forgive being lied to, especially about weapons of mass destruction or attempts to use 9/11 as a pathway to eventually invading Iraq.  I don't know what will happen with Obama, but I'll trust and support him until and if he does betray me.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|KOF2lcydaa	The Democrats and Republicans are like Coke and Pepsi.<br>  The joke is on all of us.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Size of gov. That's a joke right? Bushbush hired over 100,000 Blackwater mercenaries and 30,000 Pat Robertson grads with fake diplomas; which is pretty amazing considering he took over 500 vacation days. I guess he delegated all that damage.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	What is remarkable how many people have been tricked into believing the Conservatives are something to fear.  What they must take note of is how slow Conservative initiatives are implemented compared to, as we are now seeing, who quickly Liberal initiatives are implemented.<br>  <br>  Despite all the rhetoric about President Bush "rushing us into a war", there were over 70 UN resolutions against Saddam, all intelligence material was made available to Congress, there were committee discussions and debate and finally an vote to resume hostilities with Iraq.<br>  <br>  Yet, the Liberal Democrats take over and in the first 30 days of the new administration, they force through the largest pork spending bill every in the history of this or any other nation and no one is even permitted to read it first.<br>  <br>  And they are just getting warmed up.  Now we are hit with a $410 billion Omnibus Spending Bill with over 5,000 earmarks.  They are ready to attack the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, Nationalize the Banking System, take over the Automobile industry, take over the Health Care industry and cut the Defense Budget by 25%.<br>  <br>  My God!  And people fear Rush LImbaugh or Sean Hannity?  They have no power, nor any desire to do anything like this.  This Radical Liberal Administration is changing the very fabric of American Society.  Ronald Reagan won had a far greater mandate than Obama, yet he never crammed anything down anyone's throat.  <br>  <br>  It is my contention, that Barack Obama is so dedicated to his Marxist ideals being implemented, he does not even care if he gets reelected.  The damage will already be done.  I believe he fully expects the American People to turn control of Congress over to the Republicans in 2010 but there is little chance that will result in a veto proof majority.  So, he will be able to prevent them from undoing his changes until four years hence.  The damage will already be done.<br>  <br>  Obama has nothing but contempt for the Constitution and America.  <br>  <br>  *|`|AA11086243	A. because we can't agree on what it's job should be...<br>  <br>  B. trust is earned... Obama hasn't exactly earned mine yet... but he's certainly not broken it... like SOME people...<br>  <br>  isn't it also funny how cons said you should never question the president... and now see the "patriotism" in doing so?|`|UghJ0XROaa	Like a previous poster said, Bush tried too, he tried and was not very successful, did everyone agree with what he did? NO!  But it was okay to not agree with Bush. Now Obama is trying. Does everyone agree with him? NO! But that's not okay and we are horrible and unAmerican for doubting his ability.|`|17ff1a09056aeb1f5d9144a39ec4436eaa	Yeah, kinda like that double standard about all the conservatives pretending they care about fiscal responsibility and small government yet only elect officials who spend like drunken sailors and increase the government hugely.  Funny, isn't it?|`|Q1m85WQFaa	To be honest I think the question over the size of government should best be answered by Obama's quote of "The question with our government of whether it works" , and what ever size fits that description should be implemented. If that government is big or small so be it, better than no government.<br>  <br>  and I see what your are saying and agree on one level, but the argument I would throw at you from a liberal mindset is; Obama is by all means the only person who can do anything to help our country and pull it out of the mess it is in, so either help him or don't do anything to interfere|`|4URD5xlPaa	Government is too damn big, and getting bigger!

LjqoMHMJaa	A giant zombie alien that came from the dark side of the moon. It has tunnel vision but a transparent head which allows the eyes to rotate inside the eye socket so it can see around itself. Also, it would be able to shoot laser beams from the palms of it's hands and it would have rocket boosters attached to it's legs thus providing lift for swift takeoff. In the core of the creature there would be a reactor which houses a mini sun that powers this zombie. It would be covered with Iron, a metal which is very common on the moon and easily harvested through the enslavement of core moonsmen (the civilization of moon creatures that live at the center of the moon. This iron is there armor. Nothing can penetrate the armor since it is 20 feet thick and 10 times stronger than normal Earth iron. A thin coating of Boron would protect it from nuclear radiation which, if exposed to, could destroy the zombie in less than 3 seconds because the radiation would cause the nuclear fusion in the zombies core to super react thus causing the mini sun to implode upon itself.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	A nuclear bomb haha|`|GHusBLjgaa	Chuck Norris|`|3dehZfMwaa	A well placed Missle will work, Like a Ground to air missle for the Fighter Jets, Or a tomohawk missle for the Tank.|`|AA10652652	The U.S. and Russia have laser guided tank shells, both of which could down helicopters and probably a jet going straight toward the tank.|`|HokKFr5kaa	A Missile, retard.

Even though Jindal's policies are far superior to those of Obama (in my humble opinion), I will admit that Obama has him beat in speaking skills.  Obama is top notch in front of a prompter, without one, he stumbles frequently.  Jindal on the other hand has his own issues.  For example in his response to the state of the union this week, I found his message to be redundant (Americans can do anything) and he speaks like a parent would to a 5 year old.  When, he isn't reading, he talks fast.  REALLY fast.  He would have been excellent in modern competetive debate because he crams a lot of information into a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  In the event that he runs in 2012, the only way I see him winning is if Obama loses the approval of the American public.  If Jindal ran in '08, Obama would have won easily.|`|GJJw2wszaa	Oh Yeah sure if Bobby Jindal runs in 2012 he is a shoe in for the Presidency. Think about it all the republicans (including the former democrats who didn't vote for obama because isn't white) will rally for Bobby Jindal (An Indian). The GOP we all know how level headed and opened minded they are Bobby Jindal would be welcome with open arms ( A man who was Hindu for the better part of his life). Lets not forget  the Xenophobes who would think of him as a fellow  American (despite the fact that he is a first generation american who's parents were both borned in India and need I mention isn't white). I almost forgot the good old KKK, Nazi and Skin heads who would go out of their way to campaign for none white. Yeah, he has a lot of people in the republican party looking forward to having him as president. <br>  <br>  I say Bobby Jindal can consider him self lucky if he manages to get 5 percent of the republican vote.|`|K4KRmXc6aa	Without a teleprompter- Obama would dominate him<br>  With a teleprompter- Obama would destroy him even more<br>  <br>  Sorry but Jindal was nothing more than obnoxious. His voice was sing-songy and he also seemed very critical of the US Government, conservative or liberal. Did I mention that he sounded demeaning? I am a 21 year old adult, not a 2 year old child I don't need someone talking down to me. As much as I dislike Palin, I would rather of heard her voice.|`|h9SHkkWlaa	Great Question !   The answer is Yes . The Rhodes Scholar Jindal would reduce Obama to even  more of a stuttering buffoon than he has ever been previously . This is the reason why so many Democrats have their panties in a bunch now over Jindal.|`|crbDVI29aa	They're still too busy breathing heavily over the election of their Messiah.|`|mR50HEWDaa	Oh yeah, we're scared of Piyush.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	lol....not at all.

I'm in South Carolina, so perhaps it is different elsewhere, but I have never seen Republicans more fearful....having to vote for a Mormon. I don't know why so many Christians are 'afraid' or 'bothered' by Mormons, but--at least here--the "Christian Conservatives' were VERY wary of Romney for that reason.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	You might get your wish in 2012.|`|HZy629kLaa	Oh I'd love to see them debate about the veracity of the claim of a certain southern governor concerning a certain sheriff.|`|L8QR8EJraa	I believe so, they are giving him as much criticism as Obama receives.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	More like a shrug and a yawn.

As of yesterday there was none yet dispersed. I will be keeping my self up to date to see where and when it is spent.<br>  <br>  Welcome to Recovery.gov<br>  Recovery.gov is a website that lets you, the taxpayer, figure out where the money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is going. There are going to be a few different ways to search for information.

As soon as we are able to, we'll display that information visually in maps, charts, and graphics.|`|JthubNIsaa	The actual total claim figures are higher than being reported because they don't include those who have expired their benefits and those who can't put in a claim for benefits.|`|BsQcplTQaa	it means the Democratic "stimulus' plan is working.

If action was taken a year ago maybe we could've got a better handle on it.<br>  <br>  It will not suprise me if rates go up again.  We all have to work together to make the country better.

The rapid pace of layoffs is indicative of a 'death spiral,' though.  Corporate America has gotten really good at anticipating revenue and cutting costs - so good, that it's become a self-fullfilling prophecy.  Corporate America anticiapates declining revenue, lays a lot of people off, those people stop buying stuff, other people stop buying as much stuff for fear they'll be laid off, and, viola, revenues decline.  Good thing we laid all those people off.  Look, the trend indicates lower revenues next year, too, let's let some more people go!<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, the thing that really bothers me about unemploymen statistics is the millions of Americans who haven't been able to find work since the /last/ recession, and aren't even counted as part of the 'workforce' anymore.  Unemployment is substantially higher than is being reported, and has been for years.|`|ViEgekyIaa	I think it's deplorable. The people are now lulled into a false sense of security thinking that Unemployment Benefits will be there for them. With that spending bill and Wall Street falling faster than a drunk girl at a frat party, they'll be in for a rude awakening. The Obama Administration will only raise taxes on those still employed to pay the benefits of the unemployed, and everyone will go down in class.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	If 'under employed' workers, those who have taken part time work or work at a rate far below their worth (a masters degree waiting tables for example) and those that have been deemed to 'have left the work force'(unemployment runs out, quit looking for work) are included in the official numbers unemployment would be near 15%, twice the current 7.5%.<br>  Throwing trillions at pet spending projects will have minimal if any effect on these numbers and the money that those who are working will buy considerably less than before.
nbSvz7tqaa	Lower it to 18, and then switch the legal drinking age and the driving age.<br>  <br>  The reason it's so high is because of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which forced states to either raise the age to 21 or face a decrease in their federal highway funding. There's not a lot of logic behind it except for the fact that it's better for the state financially.<br>  <br>  I really can't stand the disrespect that so many adults feel all teenagers deserve. They aren't all a bunch of irresponsible morons, but they'll do their best to meet whatever expectations you have for them. <br>  <br>  It's like when people reminisce about their childhoods. Do any of them even remember their childhoods? I do, and it sucked. It was great compared to a lot of other people's childhoods, but it was horrible compared to my adult life. You had no rights, hardly any freedom, and people didn't listen to you.<br>  <br>  I think that the drinking age should be somewhere in the early teens when most kids are still under the wing of their parents. I would much rather see them learning from adults who care about them than from young friends who learned from other young friends.<br>  <br>  As a side note, I'm very much against drinking in general. I think that it's one of the most moronic things a person can do, regardless of whether or not they're doing it legally or responsibly. However, the law shouldn't be able to tell one group of adults that something's okay and another that it's wrong.|`|2EnwfOjnaa	We could lower it but those asinine teens who keep crashing and dying from alcohol-related driving are ruining it for others.  So the answer is no.   Eighteen-year-olds may technically be an adult but many lack the maturity that is needed to handle alcohol responsibly.  Proof?

But now that I'm 40 and look back on it, I know now that I simply did not have the judgment at 18 that I do now.  When you're 40, you might understand.

BwrGcTosaa	Since the first time white men landed there, they have set out to loot the country of it's wealth, while destroying the native population. and their way of life.  When the first Dutch settlers starting settling there, they would "claim" land that wasn't theirs, then burn miles and miles of the forests around "their" settlements, turning much of it into desert.  (to keep the natives away from "their" settlements) Then the diamond and gold miners again laid claim to those resources, they then engaged in trading the population as slaves, the Africans really haven't ever had a chance to build any wealth, it has all been stolen from them.  They have nothing left, but small groups of people left, and they are starving to death and dying of AIDS.  The Somalia "pirates" we have been hearing about are trying to get Europe to stop dumping their hazardous waste in their country, although MSM will never admit that that is the REAL reason behind it. <br>  Capitalists just can't seem to force themselves to PAY for what they take from others, they seem to think invading countries and killing the inhabitants and stealing their resources is cheaper, and better for business.<br>  <br>  Go figure.<br>  <br>  I think the white guys call it "manifest destiny" the rest of us call it genocide and theft.|`|crbDVI29aa	A big reason is the heavy influence of Communist and socialist philosophies common in Africa, combined with an Afrocentric thinking (as practiced by Obama's old church in Chicago), brutal dictatorships and primitive superstitions. There are many people in Africa who believe that a witch doctor can smear an ointment on them and they become bullet-proof, as one example.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	there is one amazingly interesting set of ideas about Africa in "Guns, Germs and Steel" - a wonderful read about why things are the way they are.|`|TEsq9K54aa	You really only have to look at any of the projects in any large US city to get your answer...and no, White folk do not go there down there and trash the projects on  Friday nights, just for fun.<br>  <br>  Violence towards other humans seems to be written into their DNA.<br>  .|`|vxbzE9hNaa	it's never been developed,<br>  it was colonized and also taken advantage of,<br>  plus there are domestic issues like corrupt politicians and warlords, backward cultures which promote conflict or reject condom use...<br>  africa was forgotten by the world during WWII, cold war and now war on terrorism and crisis...|`|mR50HEWDaa	Which part of Africa?

zLUQJxJkaa	Hey kid, guess what? That guy put those elderly women in that situation in the first place! Guess cops aren't so stupid huh? I personally would drop the ticket, but he DID put them in that dangerous situation in the first place. Look who should know better.|`|M9iO7Q0Eaa	Yeah, I read that earlier today in the news...it's stupid.<br>  <br>  It reminds me of the cop depicted in the original "Die Hard" movie, oddly enough. I guess because it was a stupid and useless thing to write a ticket in such a serious situation. It's like charging a person with theft for finding a wallet and trying to return it to it's owner, while in possession of it. This guy tried to help some people...and the cop couldn't stand it, so he wrote him a ticket. Maybe he wanted to be the 'hero' of the show and got jealous. Many policemen are in a bad mood...I know their job is stressful, and the pay is low. So they use that as an excuse to be moody, most of the time.|`|AA11409272	The way I understand it...these guys assisted the ladies in jaywalking by escorting them into the path of a pickup truck, and nearly landed everybody in the hospital.|`|c96d809951ae4f99effc004865caeff8aa	I hope that the officer gets hit by a truck.<br>  <br>  He must have had a broom up his a* that day.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	No! But that is our American "JUSTICE" system! Help an old lady across the street or leave them in the cold!|`|YUmbRmitaa	Yeah I read about this today.. the cop said he gave the citation because jaywalking is what led to the situation<br>  <br>  the way I see it.. i think his injuries are enough to warrant him being more conscious of jaywalking. i don't think the citation does anything lol|`|pX7SwZh7aa	I read about that earlier today and I can't believe they would do that. Don't they think he's been through enough???|`|0cfwrcx5aa	if he had been helping them cross the street in a cross walk, he wouldnt be in the hospital.<br>  <br>  sounds to me like he made a bad decision, and paid for it.  he not only endangered his life, but the elderly womens' lives, as well as the driver of the truck and anyone around there.|`|HokKFr5kaa	Theres a legal process for a reason, the cop was doing his job, upholding the law, so he is not to blame, that is what they are supposed to do. <br>  <br>  Any DA in his right mind would not prosecute this case...so I don't see it getting past that....|`|Vrs3mid6aa	I understand your position infact, before I read the story, I was a little shocked myself. However, you have to understand, jaywalking is a crime, and officers are REQUIRED to cite anyone that has commited a crime related to that accident. (i.e. if a drunk driver is T-boned by a sober driver, the drunk will still get a DUI) If they would have been on the cross walk, then it wouldnt be an issue. Honestly, the officer probably hated to do it but, that is our law, and it is his job to enforce it, regardless if he dislikes/disagrees with it. Chances are, if he decided to fight it, I doubt anything would really come of it. Even if he is convicted I wouldnt be surprised if the court deffered prosecution.
TxRRITveaa	Yea! His goal was to draw the differences between the parties and how they should approach this  'economic crisis'.  <br>  <br>  your own state needs to monitor your volcanos, not the federal government. However i think he could have used better examples of wasteful spending.|`|AA12020119	He is another idiot politician from the South! Not that all are, but he is! He even talked to us as children. I have a university education and understand Repubonics very well!<br>  <br>  The Republicans were so bad they could not even get someone from Washington to do their dirty work. They should do it themselves next time if they don't want to look that incompetent!!|`|crbDVI29aa	I haven't heard or read his speech, but I have to agree. Washington has no business taking money from people in Kansas (no volancoes) and giving it to people in Washington state (volcanoes). That should be up to the states, if tax dollars are even required.
S6FLJ64Qaa	actually they are.  This is just not publicized.  The FBI, as well as, other, LE agencies are constantly investigating and surveiling these guys.|`|AA10179458	I agree they are but I think beside a few pocket groups that they have all but washed away. I don't remember anything about the KKK in years. It's like in Illinois, they have the biggest Nazi party around. That being said they are not very big and not many Nazi groups cover the country. I consider both to be terrorist organizations but I don't think there is a substantial threat from either. What I mean by substantial threat is I don't see either of them flying planes into buildings or strapping bombs to their chests. I agree they should be monitored but I also see bigger fish in the sea.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	They were before all the leadership was killed and captured.|`|OlrMm5WLaa	Because they have a very low IQ|`|peybb4Foaa	Well they are totally normal people except the fact that they burn people on crosses and chant some brainless things lol.<br>  They burn people and hang them in their backyard.They are a cult and can turn into a  serious threat if they are loose.<br>  They brainwash kids into saying that they are now " peaceful organization" well that's same as Osama saying  that he is a Christian<br>  <br>  They have done lots of terrorist acts too . Planting fire bombs where black people gather.|`|9yoGMz3taa	They are on the FBI watchdog lists.<br>  <br>  There are FBI members, and independent members infiltrating their organization every day.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Those who commit terrorist actions are....those who simply promote their warped views are not terrorists...until they act  or try to act out a terrorist plan...they are allowed to talk about anything they want to under the 1st amendment.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	When and if they act out, they most certainly are.<br>  <br>  Other than that, they are simply considered idiots.

nnBAnBOlaa	You would be able to transfer to another agency.  Promotion is not the correct term.  They are comparable federal law enforcement agencies with different and sometimes complementary powers and duties.<br>  <br>  You would be able to advance in the Border Patrol.  You would have to meet the requirements of the other agencies to make the change.  <br>  <br>  Law enforcement officers often change from one agency to another for various reasons.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	No such thing as a promotion to a different Agency.<br>  <br>  Also, no such thing as a transfer to a different Agency.<br>  <br>  Any LEO wanting to apply for an entry level position at a different Fed Agency, is just that a new hire at an entry level position.|`|6lyGn3kKaa	No you would have to get a job with another agency.

UpZFb6X5aa	Depends on the brand of socialism.<br>  Some socialist systems work fairly well--lok at Denmark and Sweden.<br>  <br>  Two forms of socialism are bad. Period. One is the extreme left-wing version--communism. Then you have adictatorship, the abolishment of all markets, private property, and individual rights. Note, hwever, that in NO case in history has an industrialized country adopted commuism. A few had it forced on them by the Soviet Union for  a time--and threw it out the second they got a chance.<br>  <br>  The other is the right-wing version--fascism. That features putting favored corporations in control of the economy, abolishing individual rights, and aggressive expansionism (wars of conquest)--and extreme racism.<br>  <br>  Both feature things like spying on citizens without warrants, torture, starting wars against countries that have not attacked them. Detention withot trial, opposition to labor rights and unions, smearing or outright persecution of anyone who disagrees with them, and a claim they have a "mission to spread their way of life" to other nations--whetherthose other nations like it or not.<br>  <br>  One more thing--"If fascism ever comes to America, it will arrive wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross." (Sinclair Lewis).<br>  <br>  "Conservatives" in America are not opposed to socialism--as long as it's teir brand of socialism. It's the rest of us who don't want socialism. We jsut aren't pathological about it.|`|fmDJJobTaa	There is nothing wrong with collective ownership of the means of productions and egalitarian wealth distribution if it is voluntarily agreed upon. Where socialism fails and becomes morally invalid is when it becomes involuntary.<br>  <br>  If 10 frat guys come together to produce beer and divide up their profits equally, then that is perfectly valid. If 9 drink away their share of the profits while 1 invests his profits and reaps dividends due to owning more capital, then it is morally invalid that these 9 guys forcefully take that one person's extra profit and divvy it up in an egalitarian manner.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Actually, we do have a degree of socialism in the US. We have really since the 1940's with FDR. Obama (as evident by his own plans) attempts to further a socialist-sided agenda.<br>  <br>  As for why it is wrong...it isn't fair. Simple.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	socialism is working perfectly fine in sweden and many other countries,<br>  ppl in those democratic countires are happy with it|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	Anyone earning less than $50,000 a year should be a socialist.<br>  how else can you survive. the expense of health care, higher education, housing costs,retirement, etc|`|wyZ3Z0tRaa	being equal is never good.  b/c those that bring nothing to society will ride the free ride on those who work hard..  socialism sucks|`|r6dJTGQKaa	Nothing at all, of course.|`|006931ab45dbadcbf10afb1e4dea8726aa	Nothing,  Jesus and the early church thought it was the way God wanted us to live.|`|1ba155ac9fa4edffa0138bf7c0afe188aa	Socialism may not be here YET, but it is on it's way. Hopefully America wakes up before it is too late. I don't understand why so many believe that it is the government's job to bail anyone out of their messes nor do I understand anyone who thinks they have a right to someone else's rewards for hard work. Socialism embraces "equality" for all...but in reality it is not so....how may of the common people are able to afford the food, housing, clothing and vacations of the royals? Socialism embraces equality for everyone" EXCEPT the elitists that control the Socialist Governments. Read factual history and discover the answer for yourself.|`|sUAaeqlHaa	Ask the former Soviet bloc countries, North Koreans, and Cubans. Ever wonder why they leave their homes by the boat load?<br>  <br>  Socialism is usually sought after by those who believe in class warfare. Socialism gets rid of social classes by making everyone poor. There is no incentive to do that extra credit in school, stay that extra five minutes to get a customer to leave with a smile, or make that sales report just a little more clear. Why? Because you make the same money as the drive thru guy at McDonald's.|`|a1ZzUu7baa	Socialism works until you run out of the other guy's money.|`|0PmOYIG3aa	Why nothing perticularly, i myself am an anarcho-communist|`|h8LVh29Oaa	Taking over the banking system?

Welfare, SS, WIC, government-funded education, energy, ownership of land, farms, regulation of businesses, private control of currency to a private bank, are sings that we have been living under Keynes, a brand of socialism. But as government increases over the years, it only gets more inefficient, bureaucratic, secretive, too regulatory onto others, too powerful, yet increasing spending overseas, printing/borrowing money, while increasing debt and inflation. If you think socialism is not "wrong" look at the USSR, and how/why it collapsed. You might it looks good on paper, history says otherwise. Socialism only leads to corruption, greediness, and laziness of the public. Learn history, or go back to sleep|`|OLCoFKQraa	you don't have socialism with a capital S, but you do definitely have socialism to a degree.

CFjFaKBzaa	Try to get out of the lease by saying you fear for you life and that of your child's if you continue living there. If that does not work try to get someone to sublease the place. If all else fails, for the safety of yourself and your child's, you may have to break the lease and move. You may want to look into a witness protective service. Also, contact child support enforcement and let them know (take DV paperwork) your child's father is abusive and you are afraid he will do physical/emotional harm to you all. They can give you good cause from filing child support (well in OK they do) where you can still receive payments but the father will not know where you are. Get an order of protection against him too and always try to stay two steps ahead of the baby's father. Girl you got to do what you got to do to protect yourself and your child. Also if you are having a hard time making ends met, you may want to apply for cash assistance through your local dept. of human services, in OK we call it TANF (temporary assistance to needy families) and it sounds like you may need DV counseling.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	you have to do what you think is right for you and your child if hes threatening you, go to a safe house and ask them what to do and the your afraid for your life and your child's. wheres your family?don't let this jerk think for one minute that hes in control of your life and that child's call your recent landlord and explain whats happening to you and maybe have someone from the safe house in your area help you. good-luck , and stay safe.

I don't think we are headed to a revolution or a sudden and total economy collapse to sent us into another Great Depression. But the United States is definitely loosing its status as the top dog country. China is taking our place, and we simply can't compete. I don't think we'll ever loose our world power status, we'll just fade into the background much like Great Britain has. (If you remember, Great Britain has a superb navy making it arguably The most powerful country in the world for a time.) And although I don't foresee a revolution, I think America is loosing its democratic nature. The federal government has become too strong and its only gaining power. When was the last time a country bumpkin stepped into office to bring a little perspective? I think America is heading towards a form of socialism. <br>  <br>  Your second question is more difficult. Saying that America should ignore genocide or even starving people in third world countries is, well, wrong. Yet I can't ignore America's history of supporting dictators and other unscrupulous characters. Really, America is not the world police. We don't have that right.

Do you really think she understood what she was consenting to? A sixteen year old is old enough to know better than to have sex with a ten year old. Not only should he go to prison for a minimum of 20 years, he should be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life. Its not so much about the ten year old as it is about the 16 year old who knew better.|`|SV38vKdNaa	wen someone is 10 years old they are not even fully devolped down there unless they got there period or something ur a sick perv if u wanna sleep with an innocent 10 year old wen ur 16|`|5nkcIfKXaa	Why, why, why would anyone WANT to sleep with a 10 year old???  <br>  <br>  Come on, that's a friggin' baby.|`|mxZirRdnaa	Ok first of all you have the 18 and 16 year old thing wrong. In the United States the legal age of consent is 16, not this can very from state to state but it will never be less then 16. That being said (and I know this will make people mad but it's the law) a 18 year old can not go to jail for having sex with a 16 year old nor can a 21 year old. Now 16 being the age of consent in the United states it is actually illegal for anyone to have sex with anyone under the age of 16 it does not matter if both people are 15 it is still technically against the law. So yes a 16 year old and a 10 year old having sex is illegal because you must be 16 before you can legally have sex in this country.|`|HokKFr5kaa	I'm hoping this is a troll, either that or you must be either young or just not very bright. Anything below 14 or 15 (At least in the US and AZ) I believe has no excuse what so ever, ages 15-17 are still illegal, but generally not prosecuted, depends on the age of the male....(Example, 19 year old guy dating a 17 year old girl, probably not going to be prosecuted.) <br>  <br>  Check your local laws, or for god sakes, use some logic, 10 years old is WAY to young, even if the 16 year old is under 18.<br>  <br>  I also maybe wrong, anyone using YAHOO answers as a definite source of information needs to have their head examined.|`|Yo299r5uaa	That "THING" needs to stay zipped up.

a7mmLbiRaa	The US navy seals have a top spot for sure.  My uncle is a trainer for the seals, and those guys are nuts.You have to be insane already to even get in.  Once you are, they make you more insane.  They can run for miles on end nearly at a sprint, they can shoot almost any sort of weapon with expert accuracy, and they are masterful in several very effective forms of hand to hand combat.  I would be much more afraid of an unarmed SEAL than a heavily armed Grunt.  Most of them can double tap a target in the head, from 60 yards or more, with a pistol, in less than a second.  I was on a battleship with a SEAL team once.  The ship's crew and officers were all given running assignments to be carried out over the week.  It was over 30 laps around the deck.  The SEALS were done the next morning.<br>  <br>  The UK has a pretty tough team of marines, but I forget what they call them.  They are comparable to the SEALS. (Another poster reminded me, SAS does seem to be the name)<br>  <br>  The US Delta force is pretty insane as well, but they are muuuuch more covert than anything else.  Doubt them not, those boys are tougher than almost anyone on earth, but they are a far more undercover type operation than beach landings and bunker raids.<br>  <br>  Again, the UK has a similar and comparable force.<br>  <br>  Russia is the only other country that I can really think of that has a reputable special forces unit.

I wish SOME people in this forum would actually read the Supreme Court Ruling....for those who said 'yes'//<br>  "The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (Pub.L. 108-105, 117 Stat. 1201, enacted November 5, 2003, 18 U.S.C. § 1531[1], PBA Ban) is a United States law prohibiting a form of late-term abortion that the Act calls partial-birth abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the term "partial-birth abortion" in the act pertains to a procedure that is medically called intact dilation and extraction. Under this law, "Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both." The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart."|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Bir...</a>|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Dont know what that is specifically.

Under the partial birth abortion ban act, anybody to carry out an abortion in the second trimester would be considered ILLEGAL. However, if the mother should need medical attention by having this child, it is still legal. In all cases considered, if the mother will die, it is legal, if she will not, it is not. Unfortunately, this does not address instances of rape and sexual mistreatment as a proper excuse, per se, to receive this medical treatment. So in a most broad answer...no, partial-birth abortion is not legal.|`|OmcfwtMKaa	where do you live? i know that abortion is legal in california and im pretty sure in the rest of the country. but im not sure about the entire country.|`|yKJIN2SZaa	The Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003 generally bans them except to save a woman's life.

Knowingly giving false information or withholding required information on any recruiting form is a criminal offense (When the information would have made an individual ineligible to enlist, or would have required a waiver to enlist). It's not a misdemenor, it's not the same as getting a speeding ticket. It's a felony offense, punishable by a $10,000 fine and three years in prison. If you lie to get into the military, you are committing a felony. It's that simple. If you get away with it long enough to actually enlist, and are caught later, it's also a "military offense." You can be prosecuted for a violation of Article 83 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which states:<br>  <br>  "Any person who-- <br>  <br>  (1) procures his own enlistment or appointment in the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications for that enlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder; or<br>  <br>  (2) procures his own separation from the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that separation; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."

Since the house and the senate were taken over by the democrats in November of 2006 Bush probably couldn't do a lot of things because they didn't approve of it. <br>  <br>  I agree with you about the 3 rino's who are not true republicans. But I would classify them as republican politicians instead of a regular U.S. citizen.<br>  <br>  That's why it is so scary with having obama as president who is a democrat with the views that he has, and the dems holding majority in the house and senate. They will pass anything that obama throws at them.|`|CWcipoG7aa	before pointing a finger a George Bush lets think about this one, the guy walked right into a meat grinder starting with 911 and then the tech fallout.

There is more to be spent than there is tax revenue.  Industrial and Technical Economics enable government to spend more than tax revenues generate.<br>  <br>  Growth and infusion are the variables that confuse many who have yet to realize the imperative of learning the realities and terminology taxation and wealth.<br>  <br>  "Factory Model" education is designed to keep "huddle masses" in a confused state and under control.<br>  <br>  When is the last time someone refused to become wealthy for fear of paying taxes?

And the article is right when it begs the question, "who's next?". The SCHIP bill of course, goes after smokers, and the problem being--they need a LOT MORE smokers now to fund it and a lot more in the future to continue funding it. However, in the stimulus, there was a huge chunk of money to go to smoking cessation programs. I don't know about you...but that seems counterproductive.

Unlike the Republicans, Democrats don't try to tell people what they can do with their money. We leave iit up to individuals to make their own decisions.<br>  <br>  I realize the cons don't like anyone (except themselves) having any freedom. But this is a free country and is going to stay that way. And they are not going to get any more Bush style handouts with no effort on their part. The money is going to people who work for a living. Not to some whining conservatives demanding handouts at taxpayer's exxpense.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	No stimulus checks this go round, my man.  Sorry!  You MIGHT get a tax break.

Wq2EaIOxaa	But you just got married! Oh man I'm so sorry.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Simple.  If you live in Canada then divorce her in Canada.  She does not need to be there with you.  Your attorney will serve her notice in the Philippines by mail.  If she wants to go to Canada and attempt to contest the divorce, she can try to get a visa and come.  If she can't get a visa the court will not care.  Canada has very liberal divorce laws and you will have no trouble being rid of her quickly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your divorce will be 100% legal in Canada and everyplace else in the world, except, perhaps, the Philippines.  However, you don't live in the Philippines so why should you care if it's recognized there or not?<br>  <br>  See any Canadian divorce attorney.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Since divorce is not allowed in the Philippines, you are much better off divorcing her in Canada if you both legally lived in Canada together. The annulment process in the Philppines can take 10 years or more. A Danish friend who married a Filipina and they lived there has been waiting 8 years for the annulment to come through - even though she moved in with another man and has had children with him<br>  <br>  However if you have just moved to Canada without her and she has never lived there as your legal spouse, then you would not be able to file in Canada.|`|AA11966821	You live in Canada.  Get a good divorce attorney and file in Canada for an annulment based upon her defrauding you (she only married you for money and immigration benefits) and abandoning you by running off with another man.  This will keep her from trying to come to Canada or trying to get any (more) money from you.  <br>  <br>  Your attorney will find out how to properly serve her with the annulment papers in the Philippines.  Perhaps it will be via notice published in the local newspaper if you do not know where she is, otherwise, it will likely be by mail.  I'm not sure on service of process in the Philippines.<br>  <br>  You need an attorney!  Do not attempt to do this one yourself.  You will have service of process issues, for one thing, and a good atty can research procedures and solve that.  Mess it up, and no annulment.  Get an atty immediately.|`|R7EPaGcCaa	The question is where did you married ?If you were married in Canada you dont need to get an annulment in the philippines.Just file a divorce in Canada and if you  have have any contact information to her send the divorce papers to her to sign ...But if you legally married in the Philippines it takes for a long time to process due to Philippines govenrment wont recognise a divorce..You also hire a lawyer to process this in the Philippines and need for both you of to appear at the court to finalize your annulment..I dislike tthe philippine law for not require a divorce !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5gCmF4Txaa	Annulment in the Philippines is your best bet. It will settle once and for all your connections with your wife since it will be declared null and void from the beginning as if you were never married at all. As you know,divorce is not recognized in the Philippines.<br>  Here are the easy the steps to take:<br>  1. A Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage is filed in Court based on psychological incapacity.<br>  2. You will appear before a psychiatrist for testing who in turn will recommend in Court the annulment of your marriage based on psychological incapacity.<br>  3. You have to testify in Court even just for one day, of course with the assistance of your lawyer, in order to present you case.<br>  4. The case will be decided in 4 months.<br>  5.  Then you will get your Certificate of Finality<br>  6. You can now get your amended Marriage Contract from the NSO<br>  7. With that, you can now  get a CENOMAR if you want to marry again.<br>  I suggest that you try to contact my lawyer in Manila at morelaw50@hotmail.com for the details on the legal steps to take.<br>  Good luck!

tpfxZZADaa	No consciensious objectors were people who refused to be conscripted, were the people who didn't turn up to duty when conscripted or were able to use religious or other grounds to not go through with training.<br>  <br>  The monotorium marches in Australia, were some of the biggest demonstrations in Australian history. The Labor party played a large role in them, as they had been defeated in the 1969 election around the same time as the My Lai incident.<br>  Jim Cairns, Frank Crean,  and Gough Whitlam made it policy to end conscription and were present at the main rallies in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. Rallying popular support for an end to conscription, the war and opening diplomatic relations with Soviet nations (like China). Some other groups present in organising were the likes of SOS (Save Our Sons, usually referred to as a group of conscript's mothers though they were very active in the anti-war movement as a whole too) and the League of Peace and other campus and industry based unions.<br>  <br>  Not all of the marches in were peaceful though. (First Australian rally was 8 Feb 1970) in a few cities like Adelaide fights broke out between rival factions and people with opposing ideas and pro-war activists who tried to usurp the rally.<br>  Only another two rallies were organised by the end of 1971.<br>  At all three of the main marches over 100,000 Melbourne residents turned out. <br>  The Second rally in Sydney had protesters and police getting into fights.<br>  <br>  But the result was that the Liberal government was shocked, and media helped to change the public views of many Australians. In 1972 Labor won the election and almost immediately Whitlam put an end to conscription and began the withdrawl process.|`|AA11586960	ther were NOT consciensious objectors they were sick of Australian dying in a USA policing action which we should have never been involved|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Anti-war protesters.

n35JmhP3aa	The police are NOT coming to your house tomorrow to serve you "citation" papers.  They probably took a report from the person who had their lawn damaged.  They might come to your house to ask you about it but just tell them the truth.  Give them your friends name and tell them you let him borrow your car.  Try to get some documentation showing you were at work at the time of the incident in case your "friend" tries to play dumb and not admit to it.  Your friend should just have to pay restitution to have the lawn repaired but there will not be any criminal proceedings since it's a minor property damage crime.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	If this person is your "Friend" they will fess up to the police that he/she did it and take the ticket<br>  <br>  If not your car your problem sorry|`|CvFajKPUaa	what a great group of friends you must have<br>  <br>  if you go to court you can have your boss or co-worker come to your defence and tell the judge that you were working at the time of the incident, either way it wasn't you that destroyed someone elses property, your better off rating out your friend who is guilty than having to face the fines and ding on your record<br>  <br>  <br>  why was your neighbor yelling at you?|`|Vrs3mid6aa	Go to court with proof that you were at work at the time of the incident.

There is no reason you should take the blame for something else someone did, especially if they claim to be your friend. <br>  <br>  Anyways, the infraction is probably going to be something minor, can't image much stemming from it, I suspect a misdemeanor AT most, which if this is your first offense generally has some sort of diversion to get the charge dismissed (usually classes).<br>  <br>  Tell them the truth, end of story.|`|mxZirRdnaa	Ok relax, first of all if you did not do it then it will be dropped in court when it goes before the judge. Second of all, a police officer generally can not issue a traffic citation for something they did not witness, except for things like running a school bus stop sign. The man can file a report for the damage to his yard but I do not see where he would be able to have you ticketed.<br>  <br>  Well, I really doub they show up tomorrow I am a police lieutenant in Hollywood and I would not waste my time or any of my officers time to go back out there. Now if they do end up coming back and try to cite you explain to them that you were at work or wherever and there is no way it could have been you because someone had borrowed your car. Also explain to him that he does not have enough PC (probable cause) to issue the citation. You can not ticket a vehicle owner for something someone else did in thier vehicle.  Now if he does try to write a citation just wait it out and go to court on it and the judge will take care of it. I really doubt however that he comes back

I am not sure if there are regs limiting the distance but I know we ran 8 miles on some runs, but the pace was slower.<br>  <br>  Snipers do run alot becuase if we get into situations where we make contact with the enemy and it turns out to be a larger force that expected, we most likley wont win a fire superiority contest with them. Fire accuracy yes, but if they can bring 10 heavy guns to bear on your position you dont get to put your head up to take a well aimed shot so it is a matter of calling air and guns and high tailing it out of there. you dont want to be sucking wind when the time comes for this to happen so PT is a major part of the training<br>  <br>  ADDITION: Loved the just pancakes comment of the 1st poster made me laugh.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about how far you are going to run worry about how far they will make you hump (Combat marches) these can be in excess of 50 miles in a short amount of time with full equipment.<br>  <br>  Also theword spelled theyre is not correct it is their as a possesive|`|qRGGtzFaaa	3 miles in under 28 minutes. its for a physical fitness test that they can administer any time , depending on if your command is full of hard-asses. but you really wont have to run that much in combat , they have transportation for that. the only ones i would see running that much in combat are the snipers since they get dropped off on and left on theyre own til they get evaced.

AA10464818	It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business. <br>  <br>  One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs <a href="http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/sbir/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/...</a> , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.<br>  <br>  Your best bet actually will be from the states if they offer grant programs for women (or any other special interest groups -- minorities, women, disabled, veterans, etc). Or check with non profit organizations, particularly women organizations if they offer grants.

The number one reason I do not get approved, is that I am not a government approved non-profit organization.   The other reason that I have been told is that I am a white male.  This was also told to my wife.  If she was divorced with children and on welfare, they still would not help her because I and the children are white.

014NXPfFaa	It's not illegal.  You wouldn't go to jail for doing it, you just couldn't do it.  Sort of like trying to give your health insurance to your mom - you can't do it.<br>  <br>  But starting in August the GI Bill is transferable.  And prior to that, it was transferable to a certain amount to your child or spouse, when certain critera is met.<br>  <br>  You get your GI Bill when you sign up,but you can only use your GI Bill once you are out (Active Duty can use the GI Bill, but it would be silly b/c EarmyU or TA pays for a lot). . . You pay into it your first year.  You need to fufil your contract to be able to use it.  You need to re-enlist to transfer it.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	It wasn't necessary illegal it was just not allowed<br>  <br>  Why should someone who doesn't serve their country get the perks of doing so?|`|9tcv3TiWaa	It wasn't  illegal just impossible to do except there was an area in the Army that would allow 50% of the GI Bill to be transfered to a spouse, but they had to be in a specific MOS be reenlisting for 5 years I believe and then they would lose part of their bonus.  It was very limited.  The AF had offered it before and so had the Navy but only in certain locations.  <br>  <br>  The GI Bill pays for the AD member's education, they have to be at an accredited school, have it approved and maintaining a certain GPA  in order to receive it.  If they don't then they lose it and will have to refund the money back.  This is a program that wasn't offered to dependents unless as listed above in a certain MOS or a certain location.  They are now offering the option where you can transfer it to the spouse or children of the AD member but even then there is restrictions and not all branches have to necessarily offer it.  it will be branch specific.   To even have it consider the AD member must have either been in 10 years or longer, or been in 6 years and reenlisting for 4 more.   This will start in August 2009.<br>  <br>  Now if you are talking about other benefits, there is nothing that can be transferred.  if you are married or get dependents then they are eligible for Health Care (Tricare) when their information is entered into DEERS.  For Housing allowance (BAH) or Housing itself it is the same thing but if it is determined that it was a fraudlent you will be required to pay it back.  Several years ago the Navy required all AD member to show proof of marriage and birth certificates for children as well are lease or mortgage agreements because they had several areas that they discovered people milking the system and receiving BAH when they shouldn't have.  With Tricare there was a big bust in the Philippines within the past 2 years with doctors and former military where they charged for services rendered to people who were not eligible or a higher amount than what it actually costs, then keeping the profit.|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Benefits for spouses and children, such as medical benefits, become available when you enter the service.

Truely, L K Advani's hand is high now.|`|zH0h0Tr0aa	WHO WILL form the next government at the Centre? And if the elections to the Lok Sabha are held in the month of December, 2008 and not in February, 2009, will it give any edge to the opposition (Bharatiya Janata Party) to form the government? Will it be the issue of nuclear deal for the Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to boast off or will the demon of inflation haunt the UPA leaders in the coming general elections, which will certainly provide an extra advantage to the BJP leaders in garnering political support in their favour. And if we consider the anti-incumbency factor then it seems the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would reach to the corridors of power in the next Parliamentary elections.<br>  <br>  One thing, which came out loud and clear in recent times is that no political party is interested in holding an early elections and all the opportunistic allies of the Congress too, want this government to complete its term and thus despite a tug of war going on over the Nuke deal between the Left and the Congress, the Left is not able to muster enough courage to withdraw support from the UPA government. It clearly shows that there is immense pressure on the Left [Communist Party of India (CPIM)] from its cadres present in West Bengal who have witnessed loss of their political seats in the recently concluded panchayat elections in the state where candidates of Trinamool Congress of Mamta Banerjee won seats and CPIM received a major blow. <br>  <br>  More, the voters who play an important role in the formation of government (voters hailing from the rural India) have nothing to do with the Indo-US Nuclear deal, they want prices of essential commodities to come down. Neither they have any sense and knowledge of iInternational diplomacy nor they are bothered about the problems, which will have to be faced by the next government at the iInternational level if this historic Nuclear deal with US fails in getting materialised.<br>  <br>  Now we have LK Advani as the candidate for next Prime Minister from the BJP side. Whom will the Congress project as its Prime Ministerial candidate? Will it be Dr Manmohan Singh again? Or with the inflation going high, the Congress president and the UPA chairperson, Sonia Gandhi would play her trump card and project Rahul Gandhi as the next possible Prime Minister if the UPA wants to run the government at the Centre for the second consecutive term.<br>  <br>  What will be the role of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati? Will she be just playing the role of a King maker, which possibly looks inevitable, or will she come forward as a strong contender for the 7, Race Course Road? What are the prospects of a Third Front? Is there any leader who can convince the partners and believers of the Third front, which once came into existence for keeping both the BJP and the Congress out of power, and which became the reason for ouster of the then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and HD Deve Gowda became the Prime Minister.<br>  <br>  LK Advanis image as a Hindu hardliner leader doesnt get him support from the other so called secular political parties, something which Atalji enjoyed. His remarks over Jinnah are still fresh in the minds of Hindus and the partys unkept promise of building the Ram temple at Ayodhya when they ruled at the Centre, has annoyed a vast majority of Hindus, especially the Sadhu samaj. <br>  <br>  Other Articles by  RATAN SHARGA <br>  All praise for Dhoni and team India <br>  Where will the Muslim vote go in Uttar Pradesh? <br>  Politicians to gain from EC infighting <br>  India beats Sri Lanka in second ODI <br>  Youth factor will play a crucial role in elections <br>  more >> In the absence of any strong political issue, it can be just an anti-incumbency factor that can help the BJP in reaching the Parliament.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if the UPA projects Rahul Gandhi as the next Prime Minister, there will be some hope for the party to regain at least fair number of seats. The magic of word Gandhi is still not faded and there has been a strong following and respect for the Gandhi family in masses in general. <br>  <br>  The recent performance of the BSP in Uttar Pradesh has made the way easy for Dalit firebrand leader Mayawati. It is believed who rules Uttar Pradesh rules over India. If the partys formula of social engineering clicked in the coming Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati can become the next Prime Minister.<br>  <br>  So the electorate has to make a choice between Advani, Rahul and Mayawati. And the fate of these leaders will depend a lot on how their parties perform in Uttar Pradesh because UP holds the key to the lock of 7, Race Course Road. !~!

AA12104421	In the Catholic Church the coffin is carried in feet first, symbolic of the fact that in life, the deceased faced the altar. The coffin is turned around at the end of Mass symbolizing the deceased leaving the church. <br>  <br>  In the funeral of a priest, (post Vat II) the wake takes place in the church. At the wake the body is usually parallel to the altar. At the beginning of the Mass the coffin is closed, and rotated with the head pointing towards the altar, for when alive, the priest faced the people. At the end of Mass the coffin is not turned around, as the priest would already be in the proper position to exit the church.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	To convey the natural posture of man.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Egyptians believed that evil spirits were inside some bodies.

It was the opinion of a committee, and if you had bothered to do any research on it farther than what you saw on the 30 sec blurb on CNN, you would know that she broke no laws, and was 'guilty' of letting her husband get too involved.  I read the report, and it seemed to me that whoever was asking the questions, was answering at the same time.  I see nothing wrong with a governor trying to get a trooper who hunted illegally and tasered an 11yr boy more than just a slap on the wrist.  If she had let it go, and the trooper and her sister were still married, then she would not be doing her job.  The confusing part is the fact that they divorced, so a hatchet team was going to find her guilty of something, especially because she's on the Republican ticket.  I see nothing wrong with what she did.  If a trooper where I live did what this one did, I would expect he be fired, and if the governor didn't do anything about it, she should be elected out.  Do  you think that a state trooper where you live should only get a slap on the wrist if he tasers a 10 yr old and kills an animal without a hunting license?  I think a law enforcement officer should abide the same laws I do.  You obviously think different.   Strange......|`|MkZC5gd6aa	I think it's another frightening part of her whole frightening package.

At the end of his first year, he was selected, based on his grades and a writing competition, as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.[19] In February 1990, in his second year, he was elected president of the Law Review, a full-time volunteer position functioning as editor-in-chief and supervising the Law Review's staff of eighty editors.[20] Obama's election as the first black president of the Law Review was widely reported and followed by several long, detailed profiles.<br>  <br>  After graduating with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) magna *** laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.<br>  <br>  Look up McCains educational accomplishments and the 5 Colleges Palin went too.

He's a typical Farrakhanite firebrand. There are videos of him at YouTube linked at the page with the Sutton interview<br>  <br>  So, what do we know so far?

1HhU3B2Oaa	Hello,<br>  Although every branch of the military has the potential of being called up to deploy anywhere in the world.  The National Guard does offer some of the best incentives particularly if you want to stay in your state.  There are over 2400 armories nation wide so chances are there is one near you.  The first step is to visit www.1800goguard.com provide some information so a recruiter can contact you.  Navigate the site and develop some questions.   You can also request the number of the recruiter in your area.  You will need to provide some personal information to determine if you are eligible.  Once you meet the basic eligibility like age, education, height/weight, and a few others questions the recruiter may schedule a time to meet with you and give you a practice ASVAB test. Its pretty much basic algebra, word knowledge and paragraph comprehension.  This is just the beginning but I hope I provided some insight into what the first step is.  Good luck.|`|HBLsF7Epaa	As a female, lots of J I Z Z ON UR FACE|`|K8qAniReaa	If you go active duty in any branch of the military you will leave your state.  There is no option to just stay where you are when active duty.  You will go where the Army tells you when they tell you to be there.  It's just the nature of the job.<br>  <br>  If you want to work primarily in your state join the National Guard.  They are partially funded by the state and are mostly seperate from the active duty Army.  However, if you go guard you will most likely be called up to deploy with the active duty Army in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Deployments in the Army National Guard last about a year and sometimes a few months longer.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	any military position can be sent over seas evern national guard but if you want to just stay local join the national guard not army or army reserver active army is deployed all over the world during war or not

This would include looking at former "estimates" on exactly how the former administration spent the trillions on the wars which were presumably approved because Bush guaranteed the American people early in his administration that he would "Get the people responsible for 9-11.".

You have to remember that there are still a lot of good old boys and red necks out there that will not stand for a black president and would go out of their way to assassinate him just because he is black. I am not going to vote for him for this reason. I don't want to feel partly responsible for him being killed and someone else mentioned McCain. I don't trust him. I think McCain would end up putting us into another world war. just because someone has been in the military and been a prisoner of war doesn't make him the right choice. the only person running for office that I might consider is Ralph Nader and I'm not too sure about him either.|`|OFGE01tRaa	I think he is the front man for an undefined movement. And I am convinced that is the reason that if he should be elected, he will be impeached and convicted for a variety of charges unless he resigns. Just a matter of time. He is under intense investigation and the truth will out. It takes time. He will trigger hate and scattered violence until he leaves the White House, should he win in a couple of weeks. No other way, short of his declaring martial law.<br>  <br>  He has a keen interest in this country. His wife feels the same way, not exactly proud but a keen interest.|`|tkX8VMDSaa	Highly educated and not just attending classes either, intelligent, lots of common sense, a keen interest in his country and the well-being of all of us, understands the importance of diplomacy.<br>  If he was not just 50% white he would be the biggest winner in the history of our country, no doubt.|`|5QrLcg6laa	Harvard law grad > Republican party of CORRUPTION|`|AA12182751	He's a liar, just like all politicians.

R1LvhhTeaa	Interesting question... for myself, I'm the original cracker - we came from Scotland - and I voted for Obama. I back him absolutely.  Not sure why this thing about Obama keeps coming up - I do see it on "Answers" anyway.  <br>  <br>  It's certainly a way of marginalizing Obama - racists hope to hell he fails - and they hope that he's looked at as some dumb guy - a Step-N-Fetchit who is actually controlled by somebody else (somebody white).<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's ugly crap - and Obama's a beautiful guy and it's such a kick to watch the news and see him toss Li'l Bush's poisonous policies into the garbage can.  <br>  <br>  With Obama, we could be looking at the greatest president in US History.  To me he feels like FDR squared.|`|yoPNXiluaa	Come on you know that it is more than a little bit true.  Even if Obama wasn't black people still voted for him because he represented a newer political candidate.  People voted for the "ideology and symbolism" that is Obama. After so many people had issues with Bush, which represented the old traditional ideology of the past, anyone different or new would of been the president. That is why Hilary came so close.<br>  <br>  Don't worry we Republicans have some new young and great Republicans up are sleeves.  Not every Republican is a male, old, and white.<br>  <br>  From a Black Female Republican.|`|GkO45d7uaa	Voter turnout for blacks went up, primarily because Obama is half black...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't call anyone else dumb until you learn proper grammar.<br>  <br>  Edit: Watch the Howard Stern video on Youtube of his show interviewing people in Harlem. It proves how uneducated the people who supported him are.|`|4Aauh87yaa	Fact: 96% of black voters voted for Obama. I seriously doubt that they did so because they all just happened to like his foreign policy.|`|m1T2fSnHaa	Im being honest here:   Most blacks wanted Obama mainly to get handouts and welfare.   In the big cities there is more racism and there are leaders with many many followers of one color that teach black people something called Black Liberation Theology.   BLT, seperates blacks from whites even more- it is actually a racist theology against white people.   I think communities of black people are stuck in a rut, maybe too much drugs and anger?  I do know that only 1 of 3 kids that are black have a father, the other 2 don't.   Funny that most white people in America came here from other countries after slavery- yet this BLT, continues to insist whites owe the blacks.    <br>  Catholic religion / the pope recently announced BLT was a sin, it starts hate among us and divides us, not unite.   Its sad. <br>  Also Rap music divides more than unites, the messages in most Rap music sound racist against white people.    Its like groups of black people want revenge and are taught thats what they need to get over slavery.   Only revenge will only eventually sink in to them as guilt and make more hate and anger.     Forgive and forget and unite and look to the future not the past.  We are all equals as it should be, lets get on with it.|`|yGXKYptjaa	Because of ignorance and it's true.  If someone lived in zaire and was white and a white person ran for president they would probably vote for that person.  The psychologists call it race association.  Have a great 2009.|`|AA11086243	because they like trying to find excuses for why Obama won...<br>  <br>  why Obama didn't win "fairly"...<br>  <br>  EDIT: how many blacks voted for Clinton... it was like 98 percent... basically the same...|`|4URD5xlPaa	You ought to make your avatar more accurate, if your first sentence is correct. That line makes the rest of your statement suspect.|`|5fFgrET8aa	Blacks are not democratic when it comes to races.  Black always is  "uber alles" (ie comes first) for blacks.  To get respect you must show respect first.|`|SGwkPy62aa	The only thing I say about Obama is that he is an idiot.|`|944b14f23dca16304ce58a5d55e2a97daa	Look at the stats 99.9% blacks voted Obama.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	because it's true.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	They say it because it's true soccer boy, And polls and facts clearly indicate this , I could give you so many examples of why he was voted in because of his color, The space I have could not contain it all . 95% of the Black Population in the DC area voted for this man, Many of them openly admitting it was because of his color . I have also had blacks right here on this forum tell me, That everyone they know who is African American , Both friend and family voted for this man based on his color . Do a little digging for the truth, And you'll see for yourself what their saying is indeed the truth , Sometimes the truth is ugly and it burns, But it doesn't stop it from being the truth . Believe me son, If I had even the slightest doubt this man being voted in based on his color was untrue, I would not be saying what I am . God bless.|`|sUAaeqlHaa	If it were not Obama, just another random white guy, do you think the black population would have hit the polls as hard? I've heard estimates of up to 80% of black voters voted for the first time in 2008. <br>  <br>  Was that because they voted for a black man, or is it because millions of blacks all of a sudden felt a need to participate in what happens in this country?|`|2BWyZOy5aa	They didn't vote for Obama because he's black, they voted for him because he's a socialist democrat that promises free goodies.  If Obama was white and McCain was black, Obama still would have gotten 95%+ of the blacks votes.<br>  <br>  Liberal White voters in Iowa put Obama in the spotlight in the first place.  Blacks were backing the Clinton machine at first.|`|vTQN4QAzaa	I respect black people.<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is...the only reason you voted for Obama was because he was black. <br>  <br>  The black race...always...always always....feels like they need to catch up to white race.<br>  <br>  When you always feel like your behind...arent you always behind?<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ...accept your American...and get on with it. We've been trying to help you out for YEARS. Its starting to get old.|`|f32fab1eea4e11e137dd528a9ce02f4faa	Yeah, they're wrong.  Blacks vote over 90% for Democrats, black or not.  Black people would not vote for a black Republican for sure and in fact, they would sooner vote for a Democratic,  former KKK grand dragon than a black Republican.  They own you.|`|mR50HEWDaa	Yeah, ignorance.<br>  and stupidity.<br>  <br>  Black people always go Democratic. Yeah, he got a few extra points from the because he was Black. But McCain got a few extra points than usual from white people because he was white.|`|xwQpeazUaa	Ignorance..|`|vxbzE9hNaa	ignore them,<br>  in fact, blacks mostly vote for democrats all the time no matter who the candidate is|`|620L80L0aa	Because the blacks in Washington voted Marion Barry back into office.

A express?o completa é habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. é uma garantia constitucional em favor de quem sofre violência ou amea?a de constrangimento ilegal na sua liberdade de locomo??o, por parte de autoridade legítima.<br>  <br>  Sua origem remonta à Magna Carta libertatum, de 1215, imposta pelos nobres ao rei da Inglaterra com a exigência do controle legal da pris?o de qualquer cidad?o. Este controle era realizado sumariamente pelo juiz, que, ante os fatos apresentados, decidia de forma sumária acerca da legalidade da pris?o. O writ de habeas corpus, em sua gênese, aproximava-se do próprio conceito do devido processo legal (due process of law). Sua utiliza??o só foi restrita ao direito de locomo??o dos indivíduos em 1679, através do Habeas Corpus Act.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] O habeas corpus no Brasil<br>  O instituto do habeas corpus chegou ao Brasil no Código de Processo Criminal do Império do Brasil, de 1832 (art. 340) e foi incluído no texto constitucional na Constitui??o Brasileira de 1891 (art. 72, prágrafo 22). Atualmente, está previsto no art. 5°, inciso LXVIII, da Constitui??o Brasileira de 1988: "conceder-se-á habeas corpus sempre que alguém sofrer ou se achar amea?ado de sofrer violência ou coa??o em sua liberdade de locomo??o, por ilegalidade ou abuso de poder".<br>  <br>  O habeas corpus pode ser liberatório, quando tem por escopo fazer cessar contrangimento ilegal, ou preventivo, quando tem por fim proteger o indivíduo contra contrangimento ilegal que esteja na iminência de sofrer. A ilegalidade da coa??o ocorrerá, por exemplo, quando n?o houver suporte probatório mínimo apto a ensejar legítima persecu??o penal (art. 648 do Código de Processo Penal Brasileiro).<br>  <br>  O habeas corpus é um tipo de a??o diferenciada de todas as outras, n?o só pelo motivo de estar garantida na Constitui??o Federal, mas sim porque, conforme já delineado, é garantia de direito à liberdade que é direito fundamental, e por tal motivo é a??o que pode ser impetrada por qualquer pessoa, n?o sendo necessária a presen?a de advogado ou pessoa qualificada, nem tampouco de folha específica para se interpor tal procedimento.<br>  <br>  Pode o H.C., como é mais conhecido, ser impetrado em folha de papel higiênico, com assinatura de pessoa semi-analfabeta, ou que n?o possua instru??o para impetrar qualquer outro tipo de procedimento. Espera-se, no habeas corpus, que logo após a interposi??o do mesmo, seja a liminar concedida, fazendo com que a pessoa que está sendo privada de sua liberdade tenha-a de volta.<br>  <br>  Esta liminar é pedido feito na interposi??o da a??o.<br>  <br>  é importante frisar, que como já se disse, ser a liberdade direito de suma importancia e garantido em nossos Tribunais e Constitui??o, os tribunais o analisam com o maior rigor e agilidade para que nenhum dano à pessoa, que tem sua liberdade privada, muitas vezes, por atos que s?o absolutamente ilegais ou excessivos.<br>  <br>  Importante ressaltar que a parte que interp?e a a??o de habeas corpus n?o é a que está sendo vítima da priva??o de sua liberdade, via de regra e sim um terceiro que o faz de próprio punho. Como a a??o de habeas corpus é de natureza informal, pois qualquer pessoa pode fazê-la, n?o é necessário que se apresente procura??o da vítima para ter ajuizamento imediato. Ela tem caráter informal. Portanto, a a??o tem características bem marcantes, a se ver:<br>  <br>  Priva??o de liberdade injusta; <br>  Direito de, ainda que preso por "justa causa", de responder o processo em liberdade. <br>  <br>  é mister se dizer que há dois tipos de habeas corpus. O preventivo e o habeas corpus propriamente dito (o liberatório). O primeiro ocorre quando alguém, amea?ado de ser privado de sua liberdade, interp?e-no para que tal direito n?o lhe seja agredido, isto é, antes de acontecer a priva??o de liberdade e, o segundo, quando já ocorreu a "pris?o" e neste ato se pede a liberdade por estar causando ofensa ao direito constitucionalmente garantido.<br>  <br>  Há que se salientar ainda, que para se ocorrer a possibilidade da impetra??o do H.C,. deve-se ter presente o "fumus boni juris", que vem a ser a fuma?a do bom direito, ou, trocando em miúdos, a justi?a e o "periculum im mora", que significa o perigo de se ocorrer dano irreparável, ou seja, se preventivo, o dano de se cometer uma ilegalidade, e se o H.C. propriamente dito, a ilegalidade do "paciente", que é o nome designado para pessoa privada de sua liberdade em H.C.|`|2eiNFYtCaa	Habeas corpus,é a coisa mais ridicula que já vi.....ou é culpado ou n?o é....ou prende ou solta...é nessas que muitos ficam foragidos....bjos|`|CptNM7Sgaa	HAHAHAHA UIIII, NOSSA PENSANDO DESSE JEITO DEU ATé ARREPIO.<br>  ACHO QUE é A SEGUNDA OP??O.<br>  BJUUSSSS|`|gnGMeetcaa	Hhahaahhahha faz sentido!<br>  E o segundo....mais sentido ainda! kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Beijocas! =D|`|28749a2aa1495b1966482c64c48696f2aa	Amigo Karl,esta sua pergunta é bem ao estilo!<br>  sabe,eu acho que deve ser,dependendo da grana que o defunto(com todo o respeito)tem!<br>  abra?ao,zzaiin|`|4Nncewyzaa	hahahahahahhahahahahaha...direito civil penal etc.legal|`|507b1f8ffdc9ff8192c58c86e015cd33aa	Termo jurídico.<br>  Serve para soltar quem a justi?a ache que deva ser solto.<br>  Tendo um bom advogado facilita os tramites legais.<br>  Que bom se fosse assim, assim mesmo!<br>  "A justi?a é cega"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DTo4UJpUaa	e uma palha?ada para livrar os endinheirados da cadeia,!!!!!!!!!!|`|G4LyhlL4aa	Vc se esqueceu do Re-curso-fazer o curso de novo.<br>  N?o só soltar corruptos(bandidos), mas bandidos também.<br>  Beijin|`|bPXe60FUaa	O Jo?o já pesquisou e discorreu sobre o assunto, qualquer resposta agora é mera redundancia.<br>  Até a próxima !|`|l7Ak0du9aa	? cara,<br>  <br>  tem horas em que você abusa do direito de ser chato, né?<br>  <br>  Mas n?o posso negar que suas chatices s?o muito mais interessantes do que muitas perguntas tidas como sérias por aqui!<br>  <br>  Um abra?o<br>  <br>  Leo|`|nMk3KGA9aa	Amigo.<br>  <br>  <br>  é na realidade um termo para soltar estes ladr?es de gravatas e ricos que podem pagar bons advogados e até desembargadores, acredita?<br>  <br>  <br>  BELLA<br>  <br>  <br>  Tu n?o tens nada de bobo n?o em suas pergunta Karl, o pessoal é que n?o sabe interpretar uma boa pergunta, isto sim.|`|WWfTiOQeaa	Ora bolas.

Espera-se, no habeas corpus, que logo após a interposi??o do mesmo, seja a liminar concedida, fazendo com que a pessoa que está sendo privada de sua liberdade tenha-a de volta.<br>  <br>  Esta liminar é pedido feito na interposi??o da a??o.<br>  <br>  é importante frisar, que como já se disse, ser a liberdade direito de suma importancia e garantido em nossos Tribunais e Constitui??o, os tribunais o analisam com o maior rigor e agilidade para que nenhum dano à pessoa, que tem sua liberdade privada, muitas vezes, por atos que s?o absolutamente ilegais ou excessivos.<br>  <br>  Importante ressaltar que a parte que interp?e a a??o de habeas corpus n?o é a que está sendo vítima da priva??o de sua liberdade, via de regra e sim um terceiro que o faz de próprio punho. Como a a??o de habeas corpus é de natureza informal, pois qualquer pessoa pode fazê-la, n?o é necessário que se apresente procura??o da vítima para ter ajuizamento imediato. Ela tem caráter informal. Portanto, a a??o tem características bem marcantes, a se ver:<br>  <br>  Priva??o de liberdade injusta; <br>  Direito de, ainda que preso por "justa causa", de responder o processo em liberdade. <br>  <br>   Categorias<br>  é mister se dizer que há dois tipos de habeas corpus. O preventivo e o habeas corpus propriamente dito (o liberatório). O primeiro ocorre quando alguém, amea?ado de ser privado de sua liberdade, interp?e-no para que tal direito n?o lhe seja agredido, isto é, antes de acontecer a priva??o de liberdade e, o segundo, quando já ocorreu a "pris?o" e neste ato se pede a liberdade por estar causando ofensa ao direito constitucionalmente garantido.<br>  <br>  Há que se salientar ainda, que para se ocorrer a possibilidade da impetra??o do H.C,. deve-se ter presente o "fumus boni juris", que vem a ser a fuma?a do bom direito, ou, trocando em miúdos, a justi?a e o "periculum im mora", que significa o perigo de se ocorrer dano irreparável, ou seja, se preventivo, o dano de se cometer uma ilegalidade, e se o H.C. propriamente dito, a ilegalidade do "paciente", que é o nome designado para pessoa privada de sua liberdade em H.C.|`|ceVt4saqaa	Habeas corpus, é o termo jurídico que  o "preso"  fica aguardando um julgamento em liberdade|`|a85351f11730b3a0b627b3fc533c2be3aa	Pobre sem advogado, mofa na cadeia, rico com bom advogado sai ligeirinho com o "habeas corpus", valeu!!!|`|N9Ky6PBvaa	habeas corpus é um termo jurídico usado quando se solta  uma pessoa de modo a aguardar o julgamento em liberdade
PWvS7vqPaa	Are they illegal? No. Are they highly regulated? Yes.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, fully automatic weapons are NOT illegal. They are however HIGHLY regulated. Full auto weapons have been regulated with three different pieces of legislation. The first was the National Firearms Act of 1934, then the Gun Control Act of 1968, and finally the Hughes Amendment in 1986. In essence, what these three laws have done is to say respectfully that fully automatic firearms must be taxed and regulated, cannot be imported from outside the United States, and can no longer manufacture and/or register new/existing full auto weapons with the federal government (BATFE).<br>  <br>  In order to legally own one, you must first find one that you wish to buy. For it to be legal, it must have been made and registered with the BATFE prior to 19 May 1986. These are what are known as transferrable NFA or Class III items.<br>  <br>  Your next step will be to negotiate a price with the buyer. Most buyers have their prices set pretty firm and the going rate for a M16 varies by condition and model (M16A1, A2, AR-15 conversion, etc). A brand new, unfired, factory Colt M16A2 is going to run you about $18,000+ while a used AR-15 conversion will run you about $9,500-$13,000+. You will just have to shop around and look for the best deal out there.<br>  <br>  Once you find one and negotiate a price you will need to pay the seller. Depending on if you are buying the item from out of state or not, you may also need to find a local Class III FFL/SOT to handle the transfer. NFA/Class III items CANNOT be shipped or carried across state lines without the proper prior approved paperwork. If buying out of state, you would need to have it transferred to a local seller who would then transfer it to you. Once you have found a FFL/SOT if needed, you will need to pay the seller. Unlike with other firearms where you can often do installment payments for years or put it on a credit card, most NFA sellers want full funds up front although some are willing to work with you and do half now, half when the paperwork comes back. At best, you are looking at half up front before he will even start the paperwork.<br>  <br>  Once the seller is satisfied with the payment plan and has his funds, he will begin the paperwork. This requires a little bit of work on your end. You will need to get a few things in order for the process to be complete. You will need to get two sets of fingerprint cards done, two passport photos, and fill out a Form 4 (to include the signature of the CLEO of the area you live in) and write a check to the Department of the Treasury for the $200 transfer tax. It is this special tax that will allow you to legally own the weapon. Once you have all this together along with the required paperwork from the seller, you will ship it all to the BATFE who will then have one of their 10 or so inspectors sit down and review it. Any little error will cause it to be rejected and sent back. This is where the frustration begins as the wait starts. It generally takes anywhere from 50-90 days for them to process an application. The main thing that they will be doing is running an extensive background check on you through the FBI criminal database using all your information as well as your fingerprints.<br>  <br>  Once the paperwork finally comes back, the seller can then legally ship/transfer the weapon to you. You CANNOT take posession of it before this time or it will be the same as being in possession of an unregistered machine gun which carries a stiff penalty in federal prison.<br>  <br>  And that is all there is to it. Once you receive the tax stamp, always makes sure you keep a COPY with the weapon at all times no matter where it goes. Also, remember to keep the original in a SAFE place where nothing will happen to it as the BATFE does not replace lost, stolen, or destroyed tax stamps.<br>  <br>  The above advice assumes you are buying in state. If buying out of state, the process is the same, except that you will be required to do two to three transfers. One from the seller to a Class III FFL/SOT if he is not already one, then one from the FFL/SOT in his state to an FFL/SOT in your state, and then from your local FFL/SOT to you. There is no wait time or transfer tax between FFL/SOT's. This means that you will basically only be waiting on the time it takes for two transfers if buying out of state.<br>  <br>  If you want to be able tp purchase new full auto weapons, you will need to apply for a FFL/SOT permit from the BATFE. Getting one isn't really all that difficult, except that you need to deal in NFA items and not just buy them. If you only buy and don't sell, then the BATFE can get you on tax evasion. You must also get requests from law enforcement agencies or military units before purchasing them even with an FFL/SOT. This is because FFL/SOT is not exactly a free license to purchase full auto weapons. It merely means that you are an authorized dealer to provide them to law enforcement agencies. However, there is nothing that says you cannot take them out for some fun when not demoing them for the police.<br>  <br>  Finally, you are legally allowed to transport the weapons to places like a shooting range to use, but are not legally allowed to carry it on your person like you would a handgun.  No permit in this country gives you that permission.|`|9yoGMz3taa	Yes, just obtain the proper licenses. Each state has different rules and regulations.<br>  <br>  But, if you live in a state like California, you might as well forget about it, it will take too much effort to procure a Automatic Firearms License.<br>  <br>  Check the laws in your state.|`|2QBHT8Azaa	Well, the second amendment states that every american has the right to bear arms.<br>  Of course, you need permits and stuff for guns, and probably even more for military weapons.|`|DYoyrsT3aa	yes but you need many licenses.|`|2awmeoXJaa	only if you are in the military|`|HdSaN24caa	you need A  federal stamp, which costs about $250 and A license from A.T.F. but, your big problem would be with A.T.F. in your state.<br>  they don't just hand them out to everybody, you better be squeaky clean.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Any automatic weapon made or registered after May of 1986 is illegal.

z6O5ifdGaa	It depends on the charges... sometimes you can drop them but the state will take over the case and prosecute.<br>  <br>  For example, in domestic violence cases, the victim often tries to drop charges. But if the victim was photographed and made a statement, then the state will pick up the charges and prosecute the abuser without the consent of the victim.|`|etjy9SYsaa	If there is enough evidence to move forward without your testimony the state will not drop the charges. Also, be careful as to what your reasons are....you can be charged with filing a false report if you renig on what you said happened.|`|IpEdsgLnaa	It is very common for rape victims to wait days, weeks, or months before reporting an assault.  The fact that you waited to report the assault doesn't mean it didn't happen and doesn't mean it wasn't rape.  The police know that victims don't always report sexual assaults quickly enough for physical evidence to be recovered.  No rape charge is a waste of time for the police or the courts.  Almost all criminal cases boil down to "he said she said" on one level or another.    This doesn't mean the crime didn't happen, it means that our justice system is based on juries appraising the credibility of witnesses and determining what really happened.  If you do drop the charges, he won't face accountability for his actions and the same thing can happen to somebody else.  <br>  <br>  If you're adamant about dropping charges, call the detective.  Remember that this is a permanent decision, because the odds the police will reopen a case after repeated mind changes are slim to none.  I strongly recommend that you speak to a rape counselor before making a permanent decision like this.<br>  <br>  If you reported a rape to police, hopefully they gave you information on how to contact a rape counselor.  Whether or not you go through with the court process, I strongly encourage you to speak to a trained rape counselor about what happened and where you go from here.  If you're not sure where to start, try RAINN at 1-800-656-HOPE.  They can refer you to somebody local.|`|AA11376640	Because of the nature of the charge, it will not be dropped no matter what you say; it will be assumed that you were threatened into dropping the charges. You could face charges if you don't co-operate! What if you contract a fatal disease or become pregnant, either would substantiate proof in the end.

While racism may be a fact of life for many black kids growing up, it was not for Obama.  That was probably his struggle.  He looked more like black people, but seldom felt the racism as they did and as we understand it.  His father went to Harvard, he was a government official in his home country.  Obama went to an upscale private school in Hawaii, not to a public school in any major city in the US.  The context so many are defending is just not there.  Obama sought out radical blacks (like Jeremiah Wright, for one) to achieve this connection he probably felt he should have.  That in itself is racism.|`|Pi8yM4RVaa	If you're an bi-racial kid you would understand this.

Obama's mother was white, he was raised by whites, but he also knew his father was black, He wanted to know and understand both races. How do you call that racist? To the black man, many say he's not black enough, and the white race say he's not white enough, all he wanted was to be a part of both races. Is that not what God has ask of us all, love each other?

They will first obtain a temporary green card, six/5 years later they will obtain a permanent green card and 5 years later they can apply for US citizenship, so they too will wait in line like others do.

That doesn't mean he'll automatically vote for cloture (stop filibusters). It also doesn't mean he'll win the Democratic primary. Specter's views haven't changed much in the 40+ years he's been a Republican, while the Republican party has moved right.

I myself voted for Bush the first time. Unfortunately I fell prey to his lies and deception. After opening my eyes, I now see what a crook he really is. So is that a fair question?

We vehemently oppose the notion that it is possible to “support the troops but not the war.” <br>  <br>  I cannot respect that position.   It is indeed very much  possible to support the troops, but oppose the rationale for the war.  It would be too easy for corrupt leaders (and I'm not necessarily talking about Bush) to start wars for selfish reasons and suppress any opposition by saying they don't support the troops because they oppose the war.|`|d667a66f3d62b76aaffa924c5b438e38aa	Right on!

2fYyw4LBaa	Medical is free. Doctors Appointments, xrays, catscans, shots, medicine...As long as your enrolled in TRICARE, & DEERS. ( something your husband will have to take care of after your married) You get two dental check ups and cleanings a year (which you have to find a civilian doctor that accepts tricare patients - if they dont allow spouses to get dental at the on base clinic) , and one eye exam (glasses and contacts are paid out of pocket). You get use of the on base commissary & NEX (navy exchange) free of sales tax.  After your married (your husband takes care of this paper work) you have a 100,000 life insurance policy out in your name... your husband should have somewhere around a 400,000 policy. Um You get BAH (basic allowance for housing) either free base housing or money for off base housing... <br>  Check out the links below for medical info and where to find a doctor! Good luck!<br>  <br>  tricare.com<br>  mytricare.com|`|9fmkCRifaa	Once you marry & he adds you to DEERS, you'll automatically be enrolled in Tricare STANDARD. You need to IMMEDIATELY call Tricare and have them switch you to PRIME. You'll have to go to either the nearest military doctors, or if there's not one within a reasonable distance from your home...a Tricare approved doctor. <br>  <br>  If you have any Tricare and/or Navy Wife questions, feel free to contact me.|`|7n523JW1aa	Ask your fiance. He'll know more than anyone here.|`|neWbgaHCaa	All your medical will be free!<br>  It's an awesome deal.<br>  It's not easy being a military spouse though.<br>  Good luck and welcome aboard. :)|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Quick answer:  You are fully covered (medical/dental).  The military has one of the best medical coverage available.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	When you get married and entered into the system (DEERS) you are automatically enrolled into Tricare Standard.  With Standard you see a Tricare approved doctor and there is a yearly deductible (about $200) and  co-pay for each visits (varies).   You can stay with that or go with Tricare Prime.  With Prime you must get your ID card and enroll into it.  You are seen at the Base Hospital or Clinic unless you get a referral out into town.  For this there is no cost currently.  Sometimes it can take awhile to get an appointment for certain things.  And if you do need a referral it can take awhile to go through at times as well.  You can get your prescriptions on base through the pharmacy for free or out in town for a few dollars.<br>  <br>  For Dental that is separate, you cannot be seen on base unless you are overseas usually.  There is a company called United Concordia that has a plan called Tricare Dental.  It is $13 for individuals, $31 for families per month.  With this you go to a civilian dentist approved by them and get 2 free cleanings per year along with 1 xray.  Then the rest there is a co-pay on, depending on what it is, is how much you pay.
OUbNSXjJaa	The UN was founded as a successor to the League of Nations, which was widely considered to have been ineffective in its role as an international governing body, as it had been unable to prevent World War II. The term "United Nations" was first used by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt,[2] in the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, which united the Allied countries of WWII under the Atlantic Charter, and soon became a term widely used to refer to them. Declarations signed at wartime Allied conferences in 1943 espoused the idea of the UN, and in 1944, representatives of the major Allied powers met to elaborate on the plans at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference.[3] Those and later talks outlined the organization's proposed purposes, membership, organs, and ideals in regards to peace, security, and cooperation.<br>  <br>  On 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the Charter of the United Nations. The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council — France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States — and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council, took place in Westminster Central Hall in London in January 1946.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Some Idiot!|`|q9PVawNyaa	The Allies of WWII.

z42u6Tbkaa	I don't think so, if I die over somewhere I wouldn't want anyone taking pictures of my casket and being able to use it for whatever they wanted. I think its more a respect for the fallen thing.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	Not hiding the terrible cost of war... long overdue.<br>  <br>  Edit:  So should we put big screens around Arlington cemetery?  Cover up the Vietnam Memorial?   This has been the most sanitized war in history.  And I think it has been shameful to hide the truth behind so-called concerns about "privacy".  The death of any American soldier is a loss to our entire country and we should all bear witness.|`|LWzrCu5caa	The original reason for the ban was that Bush 1 had a great concern that Hussein in the Gulf War might use chemical weapons which would result in a large number of fatalities.   He was concerned that if large numbers came home they would have to use fork lifts and pallets to unload the planes.  That would not present a "caring" and "concerned" picture of how we treat the troops when they die.   <br>  <br>  As part of that,  with low fatalities,  they made sure utmost care was taken including flags on all the coffins,  honor guards in dress uniforms, etc.   That way if and when a picture did get taken and distributed,  and they did,  it showed great concern for the departed.  <br>  <br>  The new policy is not going to change anything as many of the families are not going to want "vultures" from the press circling around when they are trying to deal with the death of their loved one.  <br>  <br>  Just as we are passing laws to keep protestors away from military funerals,  keeping the press away where they are not welcome is also a good idea.   If the families do not want pictures we should respect their wishes and keep the press out.|`|ps5i5gQ1aa	If the family gives permission I see no problem with it, as long as the news orgs handle the situation with respect, if they dont then the ban should be reinstated<br>  <br>  ADDITION: For those saying hidding the cost of war long overdue. Would you be ok with me coming out to your familes funeral and taking pictures, then dredging up something they were involved in that I didnt think was right, and writting an article saying that I didnt agree with his/her life choices.<br>  <br>  Death/Funerals are a private thing that should be respected.  If the media didnt exploit the opprotunity to show this part of the war to further their owners and writters agenda there would have been no ban in the 1st place.<br>  <br>  If they just showed the picture and honored the man without haveing to comment on their oppinion of the war ther would be no problem.<br>  <br>  Mark my word before long Obama will be forced to put the ban back in becuase journalist are like little kids, give them an inch and they take a mile. Soon some paper will disgrace the people coming back and public outrage will force the ban again.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL ADDITION: there is a difference between a cemetary/memorial and a casket containing the actual dead.<br>  <br>  Cemetaries and Memorials are open to the public where as funerals are invitation. If someone you didnt know showed up to a funeral and started snapping photos of your family member you would have a different opinion than if they took a photo of their name on a wall or their headstone.<br>  <br>  aurorah nice leap that this is the most sanitized war. This war has more news coverage that any other war in history, there are more news outlets showing actual battle going on that any other war. The ban on photos wasnt created for the iraq war it has been in place for some time.<br>  <br>  How much has this war affected you, have you been to the VA clinic and hospitals to donate your time pushing vets in wheelchairs? have you done anything besides complain?<br>  <br>  It cost me the feeling in my right leg replacement of parts of my vertebra about 15 surgeries and a life time of pain meds. If I would have been killed I wouldnt want the press using a photo of my casket to further their political agenda. I guess under your line of thinking a person who serves and gives their life for their country and their family loses their personal freedoms once they die!?<br>  <br>  Believe me putting pictures of caskets on the front page of a newspaper doesnt make the war more real for those it has truley had an effect on.|`|neWbgaHCaa	Yes this is OK, if the family of the hero says it is. It's there right to let the world see our losses.<br>  If there is someone that doesn't want to see it then they can turn off their TV.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes if they want to. its sad as it is butthey are being recognized and i hope they continue to. its their respect we need to show them and what they did for our country.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	I am between right now. <br>  <br>  One side, everyone should see the honored. It should only be private because the families want it that way. Plan and simple, to the point.<br>  <br>  BUT....<br>  <br>  On the other hand. How many times do you see the press in places they are not suppose to be?! So do you think a simple phone call will stop the press, they are going to say, "I have a right to be here."<br>  <br>  Second, some Golf and Iraq vets know that the media covers a little to much already for us to really perform the mission at hand. Because of media we are not able to handle things the way things should be taken care of because god forbid of the world see whats war really like. I think the media has enough coverage on everything else, they do not need more stories. The Media has definatly got a leash on war in this time.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	That is still a personal matter for the families to decide and is not a topic that needs to be put forth in a Yahoo forum.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	If it is OK with the families then I don't see a problem with it.|`|kPD1Js2Haa	If the family gives permission then I don't see any problem with it.|`|gWX21Jtwaa	If it is OK with the next of kin.<br>  <br>  But a democrat is in office now and we will not see many photos any way

For example, if you price out a standard Toyota Camrey -vs- the hybrid model, you're talking about a $3000 difference in cost right out of the box.  So although you might be using less gas, you're not saving anything unless you drive enough and save enough on gas to offset the $3000 higher cost!   Not just oil companies my friend.

Both parties had a hand in this, along with greedy market manipulators, incompetent people in the financial arena, and people who didn't have the sense not to take out a mortgage that was beyond their means.<br>  And if you will look closely at the stimulus bill you will see that it doesn't do a whole of stimulating, and if you look at Obama's proposed spending through the remainder of the fiscal year you will see hundreds of billions of dollars going towards new programs.<br>  The Republicans fault -- you don't have a clue, my friend.|`|zt4GmLDBaa	I think it is because a lot of Republican realize that Bush and Cheney were a train wreck.. they aren't proud of that... but now they see Obama  heading in the same direction.<br>  <br>  Obama swears to pay down the deficit, but does he realize that all his reckless spending is going to triple the deficit. It is easy to use BUSH as his excuse.. but  paying down the deficit will be his own he is paying.<br>  <br>  All this spending is his baby now... that is what happens when you want to be president.. he can only blame Bush so long.<br>  <br>  It is good the Republicans are yelling a bit.. maybe the Dem's should have yelled more when they had power in the senate when Bush was in.. instead of just  quietly rubber stamping everything he wanted.<br>  <br>  They are partly to blame for the mess this country is in no matter how hard Obama tried to make it all sound like the other sides fault.<br>  <br>  None of them have the brains of a bee so  far as I can tell!|`|008f28a35b3530803e6d0c3e0a248934aa	Hey I am going to go s l o w l y for you demoncrats..........o    k.........<br>  The demoncrats are as much or MORE to blame for the economic crisis that we are in......ARE YOU WITH ME.....BREATHE.....CONTINUE......<br>  the demoncrats stood by while fannie mae and freddie mac were issuing loans to folks that were making about 5 cents an hour.......not a lot of money....not a lot of income...no income means no can pay mortgage...when one cannot pay mortgage....Loan defaults....that means the house gets repossessed by the bank and the bank can't make MONEY.....if the poor people can't pay and the banks can't make money...guess what???? the bank start failing....why?? because they weren't getting any money.......the demoncrats stood by and watched this because it LOOKED good....to have so many Americans buying houses....they couldn't afford them, but the demoncrats hate the small details and the fine print....so don't blame the big bad ole republicans for all this mess..the blood of this fiasco is on the demoncrats as much or MORE than the republicans....<br>  You just need to read the fine print and pay attention to details....I know that is unheard of for you liberals but times a wasting.....an educated mind and informed decisions are indeed the topic of the day....read a book and stop watching keith olbermann pleasuring himself, nightly, to pix and news of the messiah osama.....!!!!!!|`|9HRkwzruaa	MAYBE YOU COULD DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE COMING ON HERE AND SHOUTING GIBBERISH!!!<br>  <br>  Why are democrats shoving through completely useless and dangerous legislation without allowing any bipartisan input or debate?  What are they afraid of?  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but I wasn't aware of any republican-sponsored legislation that was bankrupting Smithsonian displays, making government officials ride their 12-speeds to work, or endangering Queen P's marsh mice...however, all of those completely non-stimulating causes are taken care of in your "stimulus" bill, along with a bunch of other crap.<br>  <br>  If even a large percentage of that money was going to be used to stimulate anything but Obama's campaign paybacks, I'd be thrilled.  Really, I would.  It's not, though...and my taxes are going to be raised to pay for a whole bunch of nothing.  Not only that, but my kids and grandkids are going to be saddled with the bill, and none of us will get one freaking thing out of it.<br>  <br>  That's why I'm complaining.  If you got your head out of the liberal media for five seconds and realized what's really happening, you'd be complaining too.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Oh wow. Do you hear yourself?<br>  <br>  Why are they mad when they MADE US DO IT? Oh please now. If you are unhappy with your vote now, it's because you didn't bother to go beyond Yahoo or one or two channels on your television during the election. Dem controlled Congress, two wars, and massive pork spending in addition to failure to regulate on the DEMS part is what caused this. Both parties are to blame. However, the last two of those years of the Bush Admin...the Dems had it. They have it NOW. <br>  <br>  Please stop embarassing yourself by making such Pee Wee Herman like reasoning. Are you that inept that you fail to see that not ONE of us on Yahoo Answers has any power in Congress? Your party is doing this....nobody MADE them do it. They have control. You voted for it, accept it, live with it. We may pay the price for your mistake too, but this is one thing you cannot redistribute...blame.|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	You blame us we blame you. Its always going to be this way.<br>  And we wouldn't be so ignorant, if you made this question in a non ignorant manner. You were just hoping for people to yell at you by the looks of it.|`|zkzDLcznaa	Wake up youngster, The doom and gloom started with the Clinton admin. and the last time I checked Bill Clinton is a democrat|`|AA11031985	Another uneducated question asked on yahoo!
kiyVz23Jaa	I agree with first answer. They never really say anything bad about the libs. But then the dems give Rush so much **** for saying it like it is. Oh please, democrats dominate the media, and republicans dominate radio talk show.|`|WiCjhT95aa	I guess Steven Colbert will still be airing.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No, have you been watching? I didn't see tonight's episode, but I think the past few weeks have been funny. I loved the two pastors calling Obama the 'antichrist' and 'hitler'....he has no problem poking fun at Obama too.|`|DEaIiT79aa	good for him...  If he can't talk about the liberals like he did the conservatives,  He will be out of a job due to low ratings talking about the same ignorant crap over and over.    Good for him.   sacrifice career over taking negative about your favorite political party.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	No.  I haven't watched Stewart in ages.|`|ntuJzqycaa	Comedians from coast to coast have been despondent since Jan. 20.|`|0F47hNHHaa	that's fine cause no one listens anyways, you cant get your news from comedy central!|`|l5klWLwdaa	Stewart used to be funny.  Now he's a broken record, he betrayed his comedic ability by aligning himself politically.<br>  <br>  Kilborn was so much edgier with that fratboy-esque sarcasm, he would never betray his comedy to take a political stance.|`|1CUqkJgEaa	Give him a break. This is the first time in fifteen years that the president hasn't been a guy that talks like a moron or a horny hillbilly. (Bill Maher)|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	He probably won't make fun of Obama at all... Biased comedy
9rEI0TnUaa	I don't understand you folks who ask seriously dumb questions like "Can an officer be a sniper?" or "Can an officer be a firefighter?"<br>  <br>  Officers are leaders, administrators and decision makers.  They get paid to think - not to work.  <br>  <br>  The way the military is works is this - officers decide what has to be done, NCOs decide how to get it done and junior enlisteds get it done.  Its that simple.  <br>  <br>  If you can become an officer - become one.  You'll get more pay, prestige and employment opportunities than you would otherwise.  If you can't become an officer then being a firefighter isn't bad either. Girls love firefighters.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|neWbgaHCaa	NCO (Non Commissioned Officer): Yes<br>  Commissioned Officer: No<br>  A Commissioned Officer is a leader/manager. No work involved.<br>  <br>  I am speaking from a Navy background. That's how the Navy is. I have been a DC (Damage Controlman) for 10 years. Commissioned Officers Manage. That's all they do.|`|9rhmeb7raa	If you hold a military commission granted by the President and you accept a position with any local law enforcement agency or any other agency considered to be local forces under the law cited below in the source box you must either resign your commission or resign from that civilian position. The one exception are officers of the National Guard since their commissions are given them by their respective State Governors.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	There would likely be an officer assigned to supervise the firefighting platoon or whatever (or maybe a warrant officer, i dunno) but the career management field would be 21, engineering.  You would be much more likely to be assigned... anywhere else than the tiny, few and far between fire fighter units.  (Army perspective)|`|Hk8PcUR6aa	Absolutely.  If you mean military officer, then go through the channels to sign up to be a firefighter.  If you are a recruit, finish Boot Camp and talk to your advisor about going to firefighter school.
yQ0OzEbZaa	I’ll take Bobby Jindal’s genuine faith in American entrepreneurship over Barack Obama’s fear-mongering-turned-faux Reaganism any day.<br>  <br>  But don't worry, now that Barack Obama is President money will grow on trees and free health care will fall from the skies.<br>  o_O|`|D4XWrwuaaa	I agree with grob.<br>  <br>  The Republicans I work with were talking about Jindal today and how they thought his speech was terrible.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Does that mean he's not a citizen?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	About what are you babbling?<br>  <br>  Jindal's an idiot. He said nothing bout naked emperors. Obama hasn't lied bout his father being Kenyan, or said his father was a US citizen; Obama himself IS a US citizen.<br>  <br>  Your post makes no sense.<br>  <br>  When you mindlessly believe every lie  confirmed, proven liars tell you, you loose the capacity to tell truth from lies. Instead, you should stop believing everything liars tell you to think.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	One can be an immigrant without being a citizen.<br>  <br>  I didn't hear too much of what Jihdal said, because he kept saying "Americans can do anything".  It was driving me crazy.<br>  <br>  And the way he was speaking. . .  I have never heard that before.  Was he channeling Mr. Rogers???|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	i think he was right to do so|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Look, even those who vote Republican feel sorry for him.  Jindal had to say what the Republican Party wrote.  He was doing his job.<br>  <br>  I voted for small government and GW increased its size, scope and authority.<br>  I voted for fiscal responsibility and GW took a surplus to a trillion dollar deficit.<br>  I voted for a Republican who stated Ronald Reagan was a role model.  Reagen removed troops from the MidEast.  GW thought it was a good idea to get involved in a war that began with Jacob and Isaac.<br>  <br>  The Republicans are aware that regaining my vote, and those like me, is their only chance for a future.  So, they had Jindal up there last night bashing a very likeable, seemingly trustworthy, intelligent President and talking small government and fiscal responsibility and the homefront.<br>  <br>  It is not a matter of what Jindal or any other Republican says at this point.  It is a matter of zero trust or credibility in the Republican Party that did not impeach a President who stated Republican Values while practicing Imperialism.|`|utbfT0APaa	Bobby Jindal is an up and coming Conservative in the Republican party and I like his truthfulness. We as conservatives can Never take back the country by acting like Liberals and democrats. Jindal is right in pointing out the differences between Conservatives and the liberal lies of the left in this country. "Just Words" and good speeches will never solve the problems of this country.|`|mdHqr17kaa	"Obama is an immigrant"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9CyYnBA_CY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9CyYnBA_...</a><br>  <br>  it just won't go away:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQm91-w-uYs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQm91-w-u...</a><br>  <br>  the original Hans Christian Andersen story<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_TQN4q7vbo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_TQN4q7v...</a>|`|pM81f5tnaa	Huh?   Are you seeing some significance in the fact that Obama's father was from Kenya?  Or that Jindal was conceived in a "distant land"?  Please explain.|`|6zo7eKT5aa	Jindal is a puppet. He looked and acted like a manikin. He didn't even listen to the speech. he had his teleprompter ready hours ahead of it.|`|b05dccd7369ddc637c3a871960a3360eaa	Jindal has faith in the people that built this country and the Liberals have faith in the government that will lead them by the hand and give them welfare.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	Bobby Jindal is an ***! He's a typical republican that is more concerned with protecting businesses over the people.|`|HZy629kLaa	Sorry.  But even republicans think Jindal gave an awful, awful, speech.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	I think Bobby Jindal is just doing what he thinks is best for his state, and that by relating this tale of his life he tries to show that Obama's story is not singular, or so drastically unique that a person should be made president and allowed to push for the single most wasteful legislation ever by any country.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	Like I said last night, Jingles was like a cardboard cutout lip syncing, that is about how much charisma and ability to hold an audience. he was a huge disappointment to the republican party. He spoke like he was talking to toddlers and said all the wrong things. I cannot say who is brighter he or Palin.|`|AA10779599	Obama is still trying to sell the public clothes he isn't waring/have.  <br>  <br>  I'm surprised the public bought 2 books written By & about a fool that had done nothing with his life!

Close to the middle, easy going live and let live, but don't have any problems with right vs. wrong whether based on morals or scruples depending on if you are religious or not. You probably think most politicians are crooks and are most likely to vote for the guy you think will serve your interests instead of a party's. That's my 2 cents|`|fyhl3TQgaa	You're an authoritarian leftist, a communist. I'm a liberal leftist, a moderate socialist.|`|kl9tTmGLaa	You're obviously a liberal.

Belief that the government should regulate markets is authoritarian (as opposed to libertarian), as is mandating doctors to provide services they themselves may believe to be wrong, such as abortion. A moderate Democrat would have arguments to justify such (authoritarian) positions, generally by appealing to the idea of public good, and the role of authority in providing for it, such as by preventing market failures, or preserving a woman's right to choose.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	Your slightly left of center.  You don't hate government but you don't want it involved in every part of your life.  I would say (just by the graph) that you are a centrist Democrat but depending on your ideas on some key issues (abortion, gay rights, death penalty, etc.) you might fall into centrist Republican.  Basically, you're a pretty average American.|`|6OFHemITaa	Don't worry, you may be young and liberal now, but there might be hope for you to move to the RIGHT.

Obama is going along with the gag with his surge of troops into Afghanistan. <br>  <br>  and the government of Pakistan is edging ever closer to collapse, if that happens their 50 or some nuclear weapons will be up for grabs.<br>  The Taliban and Al Queda are already in Pakistan too.<br>  <br>  I don't know if terrorists with nuclear weapons is L.O.L. but it will certainly provide lulz.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	War on terror, poverty, drugs, crime, same game different players. How about a war on gummin rip-offs.|`|AA11791519	Yes, especially when you consider that "terror" is an emotion.  How can one wage war on an emotion?  I mean, I don't think anyone has to be fought into a position of not wanting to feel terror; that's a pretty universal "no-no".  (When was the last time you heard someone say, "I love being terrified"?)<br>  <br>  But the way in which this particular "war" has been waged has actually been the cause of much of the "terror" that people feel.  The past administration used it as a way to scare us into giving up rights, and to engage in an illegal, unnecessary war.  Not too funny, eh?|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	If you aren't afraid, good for you. But it's real. Iranians parading down the street with signs that say "Death to America" while burning our flags doesn't really APPEAR to be a friendly gesture. But if it doesn't bother you...so be it.

At least he made fun of himself, unlike the Moose Queen, who just sat there like a twit while other people made fun of her.   He's a good guy, I actually feel bad for him that he's been forced to run such an awful campaign.   I might have even voted for him in 2000 until he let that repugnant Bush take him down.  It's really a shame.|`|RxQSSUNraa	He is really good at making fun of himself.

He is kinda like that in the campaign, I mean he does have jokes and stuff...but I know what you mean. It's possible...|`|nub4fUJLaa	He was much better than Palin was.  True.

VK6jXBzLaa	Reading some of your answers, I can tell none of you live in Texas because this type of history is 4th grade material. Texas was a state before the Mexican-American War. Texas and Mexico had been fighting a border dispute for years, and Mexico still refused to recognize that Texas was independent. The U.S. offered to buy California from Mexico. Mexico was offended and refused, so the U.S. used the border dispute to pick a fight. After the U.S. won the war, the Rio Grande was established as the southern border of Texas and the U.S. bought the territory that would become the American Southwest from Mexico for the originally offered price.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	We fought the Mexicans prior to the Civil War.|`|9I3wHIdraa	It is when the US decided that they wanted to expand their territories to other countries territories.

It was not until the emergence of Pancho Villa that Mexico gained it's independance from Spain, though part of that was Spain's decline, not his tactics. It began when a US ship caught fire, blew the magazine (where gunpowder was stored) and sank. The Press immediately jumped the shark, called it a deliberate attack, and the US rushed into action-mode (not that the government cared at the time what the truth was, we needed a good reason to halt Spain's expansion so close to home.)|`|qC9pcfP5aa	Mexico invaded us in 1846.

FDvJnb9jaa	Traffic violations have no bearing on enlistment. When I was a recruiter, 5 misdemeanors is one too many. 4 is the maximum you could have. If your brother has some charges that were dismissed, then that would help out his case. If he did have a charge that was dismissed he still needs to tell the recruiter. Lying will screw him in the future. If the recruiter tells him to lie, then he needs to find a new recruiter quickly.|`|5zmLes9kaa	Army and Marines he'll be okay to join with a waiver which they will get him.

The Air Force required a waiver to get in at all with a misdemeanor, but the Army let me join without one. The only stipulation was that I couldn't qualify for a top secret clearance on my first enlistment term (I did get a secret clearance which was needed for my MOS in comms). <br>  <br>  I'm not positive, but it may depend on what he wants to do in the Army.  They'll let just about anyone in to do basic infantry and arty jobs. The recruiters have a quota they have to meet per month so they'll usually overlook a few things and tell you to lie at the MEPS station (where you go to get your physical, swear in, etc.).<br>  <br>  At least half of the people I talked to in the Army (about this) told me they had lied about something at MEPS when they joined :P|`|RKHViwqQaa	They'll probably take him.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	You assume he wishes to fix the economy? <br>  <br>  Liberals when they see something in the economy that is broken, ask what the government can do to "fix it". Conservatives ask what the government did to cause the problem. Of course, the "fix" is to stop abusive taxation and let the mighty engines of a free economy pull the ship out of the abyss.<br>  <br>  "Trying to tax a country out of debt is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by pulling on the handle" - Winston Churchill<br>  <br>  The last president to raise taxes in a recession was Hoover. He cause the great depression. FDR made ot longer and worse by continuing to tax the rich. he had the insanely misguided philosophy, government could create jobs. <br>  <br>  Obama's pie-in-the-sky story followers will follow him. He is a Democrat. He will continue to blame Bush, big oil, big pharmaceutical, rich people, He will never ever take the blame for anything that goes wrong and he will never admit to doing anything wrong. He will play the race card and get out of jail free. The ones who will abandon him will be doing it too late, after the damage is done. The party of the poor, will become more powerful as more and more poor people are created who need government help. They will continue to be deluded into thinking the rich have too much money and tax the rich. He will continue to foster division along racial lines and along economic lines. The new disenfranchised will vote democrat because the republicans will continue to want to cut back government spending and take their little piece of the pie away. Of course, the only way to fix things is to cut back spending and lower taxes. Obama knows full well what he's doing. He knows raising taxes will slow the economy. He knows prices will go up to cover increases in corporate taxation. He knows The rich will cut back and make employees work harder for less. He knows stock holders will earn less on investments. He is also lying when he states no one under 250,000 will be taxed more. They will be. he intends to roll back the Bush tax decreases that have saved the economy from disaster. Rolling back Bush tax decreases is a monumental tax increase on the poor and middle classes.<br>  <br>  The media has been suffering for a long time due to the popularity and truthfulness of right wing talk radio. The democrats seek to put a muzzle on it. The fairness doctrine will be enacted against talk radio as a "thank you" to the major channels. We will be left with continual, unrelenting left wing propaganda. They saw Hillary with a larger chance of losing. The media picked Obama because he was (supposedly) a blank slate. He says hope, people think it's what they are hoping for. He says change, People think it's the changes they want. Well, "hope" never put groceries on the table and Change can be very bad (consider cancer) <br>  <br>  There is a concept well known in physics, it applies to politics as well. Inertia, A body in motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest tends to stay at rest unless forces are applied. If Obama wants change, he will have to use force. The Missing part of the Obama propaganda blitz is: How much force will Omaba use? Who will Obama force? How much force will Obama use? Will Obama ever stop using force? Democrats don't understand the force will be applied to themselves as well as Republicans as Obama and the other ultra-liberals in Congress and the Senate try to spread more and more wealth around. <br>  <br>  Liberals have changed the definitions of so many words and ideas, it's blurred the meanings of good and evil. Liberals who believe the new definitions believe they are doing something good when they aren't.|`|sekbDVHgaa	2/3s of the US economy is based on consumption, which means main street. If you strengthen Main Street, Wall Street will strengthen as a bi product. <br>  Keeping that in mind, Obama's plan for a Stimulus plan for the Middle Class makes sense also the last Stimulus resulted in a 2.6% GDP growth for that quarter. <br>  The only thing that can get us out of this crisis is jobs and quick. Which means helping Detroit, Infrastructure expansions, behavior inducing tax credits. <br>  Also Socialized Medicine will get 40 million Americans from not filing bankruptcy, I think that might help the credit crisis by the way just going on a tangent the Republican Presidential Candidate spent his entire life on Socialized Medicine and has yet to give it up.<br>  There is lot more going on, but lets just wait till he begins serving as President. <br>  |`|bqJgdcfLaa	Spending is the only way a government can shorten a recession.  If you are against spending there is nothing he can do to fix the recession.<br>  <br>  "Socialized medicine," and I suppose that is medicine that is just getting back from daycare, is exactly the sort of program that is necessary for getting through tough times like these.  Don't worry though, your people in the Senate will keep universal healthcare from passing.  |`|UUhGsEw1aa	For a start, Obama could get on television tommorrow and swear he won't raise taxes on capital gains and he would veto any attempt by congress to do so.  He won't do this though because he has been saying for 2 years that he is going to raise taxes.  So the stock market keeps going down. Eventually we will have to name it the Greater depression of Obama and then get someone in office who will fix the economy.|`|U2m4XgJDaa	Well this is what I would say to him:<br>  1.) To fix the credit crisis I think you should authorize a mass bank write off. What this would do is two things. <br>  1. It would write off all american bad debt in the country...not to mention the banks would save money since they have to pay collectors to recover.<br>  2. it would make each taxpayer responsible for their own mistakes as the IRS would consider this a gift. <br>  3. It would create revenue as each taxpayer would have to pay for these gifts. But not just make this a "gift" to the government. <br>  Offer incentive to each person who choses to participate in this a clean slate credit score wise. <br>  <br>  Lastly, give another stimulus check|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	I'm right with you on this one: he won't.   He indeed has no experience with it, and his words have demonstrated his limited understanding.  <br>  <br>  People argue that he will surround himself with advisors who know economics, but so far we only see him surrounding himself with the advise of the type of people who got us into this mess and are busy spending trillions to bail out big business, and have a history of taxing and spending.  <br>  <br>  So I am not hopeful for him fixing anything.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Obama never said he was going to "fix" the economy.  All he ever said was that we NEED  to fix the economy and get away from the Bush economic plan.  He never offered a solution, only increases in spending by the government called "investing" which simply means more taxes.|`|2ruafsC5aa	WooHoo, Bobby Jindal 2012! Louisiana Resident, just voted for him!|`|1ca9c2dceed8a4835952ad55d370a5e2aa	You hit the nail on the head with this one.<br>  <br>  <br>  The biggest fear that most of the republicans have is that no one can really answer this question. Obama has done nothing in the past to show his ability to fix our economic problems.<br>  <br>  My question is this....... Obama wants to take a scalpel to our government programs. <br>  <br>  1. How long does it take a surgeon to operate on a human foot?<br>  2. How long would it take that same surgeon to operate on everything from the neck down?<br>  3. How long will it take Obama to cut out all the spending that he promissed if he has to take a scalpel to the entire patients body?|`|pyIGNgaXaa	He's not going to do ****! But he'll have a good pension plan for himself!|`|WHKsp4tWaa	He can’t<br>  <br>  It would do all people here well to become more informed about economic matters, as not one person here has addressed the true controlling factor of our economy, The Federal Reserve.

The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”<br>  - Thomas Jefferson|`|fGE7hL12aa	The way to fix the economy is to control government spending. A balanced budget would be the best fix. Reduced taxes would help also.<br>  <br>  Obama doesn't have control over the economy, so he should concentrate on the things he can control, like government spending.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	He doesn't have any experience fixing economic problems, he has no experience in foreign relations, he has very little experience at all to speak of.  He is however a smooth talking Bull shi**er and the libs seemed to like that so here we go.<br>  <br>  |`|kE29abUUaa	Obama doesn't have any plans to create universal health care (something that every other western nation has) and I don't know where people are getting this idea. Trying to make health care more affordable doesn't equal universal health care. Also, health care has little to do with the economy. The treasury doesn't suffer in any way.<br>  <br>  This is how universal health care works...<br>  Instead of people paying for health insurance, they just pay slightly higher taxes. Hospitals become government owned, a high set of standards is created. The government isn't out to make a profit out of it.<br>  <br>  People in countries with universal health care generally save more money and are never turned down for medical treatment. Universal health care isn't about politics, but humanity. No one should be denied medical attention.|`|NqNbIp2caa	Since Obama has no plan to introduce anything that could remotely be described as "socialized medicine" and since you lot all questioned Clinton's ability to solve Bush 41's economic disaster (ie before Clinton created the longest economic expansion in history with 23 million new jobs, lower poverty and higher median wages) I am just left wondering - don't you guys ever get tired of being wrong?|`|kAfZaLwraa	... spending without income is better than spending with income?

Because there were incriminating records that he could not let out of his sight lest they get leaked to the media.<br>  Bruce Fein, the deputy attorney general of the United States under President Ronald Reagan, from his post "Impeach Cheney," posted at Slate.com on June 27, 2007.concluded....<br>   "In the end, President Bush regularly is unable to explain or defend the policies of his own administration, and that is because the heavy intellectual labor has been performed in the office of the vice president.

Since it was the stated general rule that the scope of a warrantless search must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its justification permissible, and since it was the rule that the justification of a search of the arrestee was to prevent destruction of evidence and to prevent access to a weapon,217 it was argued to the court that a search of the person of the defendant arrested for a traffic offense, which discovered heroin in a crumpled cigarette package, was impermissible, inasmuch as there could have been no destructible evidence relating to the offense for which he was arrested and no weapon could have been concealed in the cigarette package. The Court rejected this argument, ruling that "no additional justification" is required for a custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause.218<br>  <br>  216 Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392 (1914); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 158 (1925); Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30 (1925).<br>  <br>  217 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762, 763 (1969).<br>  <br>  218 United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235 (1973). See also id. at 237-38 (Justice Powell concurring). The Court applied the same rule in Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U.S. 260 (1973), involving a search of a motorist's person following his custodial arrest for an offense for which a citation would normally have issued. Unlike the situation in Robinson, police regulations did not require the Gustafson officer to take the suspect into custody, nor did a departmental policy guide the officer as to when to conduct a full search. The Court found these differences inconsequential, and left for another day the problem of pretextual arrests in order to obtain basis to search. Soon thereafter, the Court upheld conduct of a similar search at the place of detention, even after a time lapse between the arrest and search. United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800 (1974).<br>  <br>  However, the Justices have long found themselves embroiled in argument about the scope of the search incident to arrest as it extends beyond the person to the area in which the person is arrested, most commonly either his premises or his vehicle. Certain early cases went both ways on the basis of some fine distinctions,219 but in Harris v. United States,220 the Court approved a search of a four-room apartment pursuant to an arrest under warrant for one crime and in which the search turned up evidence of another crime. A year later, in Trupiano v. United States,221 a raid on a distillery resulted in the arrest of a man found on the premises and a seizure of the equipment; the Court reversed the conviction because the officers had had time to obtain a search warrant and had not done so. "A search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest."222 This decision was overruled in United States v. Rabinowitz,223 in which officers arrested defendant in his one-room office pursuant to an arrest warrant and proceeded to search the room completely. The Court observed that the issue was not whether the officers had the time and opportunity to obtain a search warrant but whether the search incident to arrest was reasonable. Though Rabinowitz referred to searches of the area within the arrestee's "immediate control,"224 it provided no standard by which this area was to be determined, and extensive searches were permitted under the rule.225<br>  <br>  219 Compare Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192 (1927), with Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344 (1931), and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452 (1932).<br>  <br>  220 331 U.S. 145 (1947).<br>  <br>  221 334 U.S. 699 (1948).<br>  <br>  222 Id. at 708.<br>  <br>  223 339 U.S. 56 (1950).<br>  <br>  224 Id. at 64.<br>  <br>  225 Cf. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 764-65 & n.10 (1969). But in Kremen v. United States, 353 U.S. 346 (1957), the Court held that the seizure of the e

One of the parents MUST have resided in the U.S. prior to the child's birth. No specific period of time for such prior residence is required."<br>  <br>  See <a href="http://travel.state.gov/law/info/info_609.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/law/info/info_60...</a> for specific details.<br>  <br>  (If they are not married or if only one is a citizen, then the residence rules change quite a bit and proofs required may change, but in general you are probably a citizen at birth.  You can find more at the same link.)<br>  <br>  The Supreme Court has defined "two" types of citizen.<br>  <br>  One is naturalized, those who have gone through a process prescribed by law to become a citizen. They were not a citizen and then they beca,e a citizen. These are not "born" citizens.<br>  <br>  The second is "born" which means someone who is a citizen at the time of his/her birth. It has divided the born category into two types: those born in the US or its incorporated possessions, which the 14th amendment covers: " All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. "<br>  <br>  And anyone as in your example, who is born outside the US is a born citizen but not by reason of the 14th amendment. The only distinction made in the "non-14th amendment" citizens is that Congress can control the terms under which their citizenship is granted; it is not automatic that you are citizen at birth by the amendment, but instead it is automatic by law. For example, requiring that your parents have resided in the US. The court has held that the Congress has the power to make laws that would not unreasonably take away citizenship if you are not a 14th amendment citizen. For example you can lose your citizenship in some situations if you never come to live in the US up to a certain age. It allows the residence requirement for example.<br>  <br>  But because you become a citizen at birth, it has made no other distinction in law, and for the operation of laws it has only two classes of citizen: born and naturalized.<br>  <br>  It has never defined "natural born" citizen and has never made any distinction between native born or natural born or born citizens in any ruling (except as to 14th amendment), in every ruling it has made no distinction and has used the terms native born, natural born and born interchangeably, sometimes in the same decision.<br>  <br>  While it's a good idea to register your birth at an embassy or consulate, it is not a requirement to obtaining citizenship, it is an acknowledgment or proof of citizenship.<br>  <br>  If you ran for President in such a case it is sure that debate would rage about your eligibility. But the court hasn't ever ruled on that clause and as I noted has made no distinction in any of the rulings it has made. No one knows what it would say if a case ever arrived of that sort, all we can say is they don't seem to have made a distinction so far.<br>  <br>  John McCain was born, not just on a military base but in the Panama Canal Zone (which no longer exists) which was defined as an organized territory under the sovereignty of the US. <br>  <br>  A US military base is not part of the US when in a foreign land; Guantanamo is not US territory in that sense, it is precisely because it's not US territory that it can be used without the constitution applying to what the government does there...<br>  <br>  So it might be that he is a 14th Amendment citizen, the Court has not ever rules on this question, but his birth to two US citizens definitely made him a citizen at birth (natural born citizen) either way.

d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	It would be illegal if the person being video taped had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  For example it would be illegal to video tape someone in a bathroom, locker/dressing room or in their home through a window which are places where a person expect to have reasonable privacy. <br>  <br>  In public it is a different issue, there is no expectation of privacy when you walk down the street or are in public areas.<br>  <br>  The classroom is a public area even if it is in a private school. The reason is that at any moment any number of individuals could walk into that class room and observe(See) you.  You as a reasonable thinking individual would expect this so you would not be surprised to see another teacher or student walk into the class room. Therefore you would not expect a level of privacy comparable to say changing clothes in a locker room.<br>  <br>  The school can have a written policy and post signs in the public spaces where it wishes to prohibit video and photography of any kind. But this policy must have been in place before the incident in question, The policy must be applied in a consistant fashion, and the policy must be communicated via signage. <br>  <br>  <br>  You must also consider how your images may be used.

n2oEhdZiaa	You should be elligible for the split option in college.  It is just discouraged because when you do split option, you can't get college first and college first gets you an extra year of non-deployability over split op.  You also can't draw your GI Bill until you are MOS qualified.  There also used to be a difference in the kicker - regular kicker was an extra 200 a month while the college first kicker was 350 a month, so once you started drawing benefits you'd be getting 150 less a month in GI Bill on top of everything else.  That last part may have changed though.  Most people decide to go with missing a semester or vary rarely, applicants will take an 11B or 21B school (14 weeks OSUT) and leave right after they graduate and squeak back just in time to start college.  It's hard, but doable.|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	I know multiple people that are in college that are doing the split option program, I don't see why they wouldn't let a senior do it.

If you don't pass you AIT (training for the specific job) AND ANY OTHER TRAINING, YOU GET NO BONUS because you didn't honor your contract.  If you have air borne ( or other additional training) in your contract and don't pass that it can affect you bonus to, again if you don't full fill your contract (your end of the deal) don't expect the Army to just give you money for no reason.  How the bonus is paid will depend on the amount.  The criteria changes from time to time.  In the Army you have to be MOS qualified (meaning you passed ALL your initial training) and process in at you gaining unit.  Than you will receive you bonus for the amount and the payment plan the way it is described in your contract.  And yes it is taxed heavy but you will get most of it or all of it back at the end of the year.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	There are a variety of bonus amounts and payment plans.  It is based on what branch and component you are joining, what MOS you choose, and if you are going into the Guard/Reserves, what the priority of your unit is.

It is the same strain that caused the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1917 that killed millions. Back then we didn't have flu shots, antibiotics, or Tamma Flu. We do now and it shouldn't be that big a deal and kill so many today in America. It is not even this outbreak that will cause a Pandemic it's the fall outbreak of Flu season that might kill lots of people globally.  The strain of H1N1 has been known as Hong Kong Flu, Russian Flu, and Bird Flu in the last 50 years depending on it's origin or what animal the mutated virus came from. Today it is swine instead of birds.<br>  <br>  Don't confuse this strain H1N1 with the strain near Fort Dix NJ back in the 70's which was H3N2 . It like this current virus was incubated in swine but it was a different strain. It poses little threat to Americans but could devastate the 3rd world.|`|y08ZRyDgaa	i don't think it's hyped up i think we caught it early and are over doing it so we don't underestimate it one kid has died so far from it but we don't know what this virus is capable of so just in case we have to hype up so Americans won't go on vacation over there and bring it more of here it's for a number of reasons just hoping it's not going to be like a pandemic or worse hopefuly they will contain it before it gets worse.|`|7bIrMvziaa	No,the swine flu is totally different from the regular flu.<br>  The swine flu is similar to the flu virus that killed so many in 1918.What I find fishy is how it is all over to many parts of the world at once.Perhaps the CIA created it.|`|p8ylHBJxaa	its so hyped because it broke out so suddenly on young healthy adults...its not as big of an epidemic as people are saying though<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090429120332AAGAvZI&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|cwkttTXxaa	Smarter than the HHS, CDC, WHO, other national health organization is a major claim.

You see, MSNBC, CBS, CNN, ABC and NBC are all P.R. people of the administration and they are in his pocket, so when FOX criticizes him and has debates regarding his administration, it bothers his ego which has been inflated to such an extent that this man wants total obedience, he wants total allegience; he is out of control, he wants to be a leader that no one dare question!  Simple as that!  I would love to see Obama go on FOX and debate the issues, but it will never happen believe me.  We need to debate health care, we need to debate so many issues, but will he do that?  Will he allow our representatives to debate these important issues?  I really don't think so.|`|G26sRgXDaa	Well in my humble opinion, he doesn't like Fox News because he can't fool them and lead them around by the nose.*|`|wdBY1fWaaa	He hates Fox News, but the school name is no relation.

woh7uWj6aa	Of course you can take someone to court to ask the court to make them responsible for their actions.<br>  <br>  In all likelihood this would go to Small Claims Court (in the US), where the standard is a preponderance of the evidence.  In other words, if you can show there's more weight that your friend is guilty of actions that caused you the loss than not guilty, you'll win.  However, your friend can claim that someone else sent the text from her phone, that it was a joke, etc.  The judge will decide credibility of the testimony and determine whether you prevail or not.<br>  <br>  By the way, in Small Claims court you will not have to demonstrate a duty of care responsibility of the plaintiff.  The judge will likely ask about the timeline, and if you did not go back to the house for several days (if at all), you may be regarded to have abandoned the items yourself.  Generally the standards in Small Claims court are low and for that reason you do not have a lawyer representing you.  I do agree with quizzard that you will probably expend more effort than it's worth to recover what you've lost.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	First of all, you will have to prove she had a duty of care for the items.  Just because you left them at her house does NOT mean that she agreed to keep them.<br>  <br>  Second, you'd have to show that you used reasonable care in retrieving your stuff.  Once she sent the text message, it was your responsibility to go get your stuff.  If you did not act immediately, the question becomes when the stuff disappeared. <br>  <br>  Lastly, text messages are not 'proof' of anything.  There are many people who can fake text messages, so they are meaningless in court unless she agrees she sent them.<br>  <br>  You can try to get something in court, but unless you had significant losses, it's really not worth the time it'll take you.|`|bb3e025f3fde1b98671f9679c220cc7caa	Sure, you left them in her care and she recklessly abandoned them. You can sue.

8fa215b02b31950bc4191e113386130baa	I don't think Obama understands much of anything except how to make a kick a$$ pitcher of cool aid. It blows my mind that he, the msm, and most dems in general buy into the notion that taxing corportations will help the economy.  I'm not crazy about some of these bonuses given out to CEOs, but lets face it, the owners of these companies are not the CEOs, it is the share holders.  When these evil companies who make obscene profits are taxed, profits go down, stocks go down, and normal, everyday people who invest their money for retirement are hurt.  Yet, people buy into the notion that large corporations shouldn't make a lot of money because its a bad thing.  It's a bad thing if you spend your last $20 every month to buy a carton of cigarettes rather than invest it in something that may be worth something some day if you ask me.|`|299082f448eea7a4e47b71cf8d97b274aa	i don't think the question is whether or not Obama understands commerce because i can almost guarantee you he knows more about it than you...<br>  |`|xZ1GD4zbaa	He understands socialism and that's where he'll lead us.|`|U31rOBFGaa	I know a racist when I hear one.

You need money to create jobs...you don't just create jobs out of nothing.  These things take money.  The gov't should be there to provide short term assistance that could include things like loans to innovate, job training, etc.  Things that make someone more independent long term.  The gov't could also support job creation in communities by giving tax breaks to businesses who will relocate to depressed areas.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	It takes money to make money.

I had an extended discussion with someone on Yahoo Answers about this. Their position was that they should not have to move to where the jobs are. It then morphed into a discussion on his part about what is wrong with the world and why it should not be this way. My answer was simply that reality is reality. Whether you choose to like it or not is irrelevant. I moved across the country so I could have a job once then I returned home when economic situations allowed for that possibility.

That question makes about as much sense as a soup sandwich|`|aSjdL4heaa	The economy needs quick stimulus - there is very little debate on that fact.    Our infrastructure (roads, sewers, power distribution, etc) is in terrible shape from neglect.  There was just a new report on this released in the last 24 hours.  A poor infrastructure will hurt our GDP.  Ignoring infrastructure repair (as has been done for years) just passes the problem on to our children ... or maybe we're the 'children' that it got passed to, if the new report is to be believed.    We have numerous 'shovel ready' infrastructure projects that need funding.    Tax cuts affect a lot of  people, but each person only saves a little bit every month.  It takes years to accumulate enough money to spend enough money to increase demand enough to create jobs.    Yet Republicans seem to want tax cuts over spending.  This is because they are still wed to the concept of 'trickle down' economics - where you cut taxes for wealthy people expecting them to spend more which slowly trickles down to the general populous.  Unfortunately this takes a lot of time (which is why they use the term trickle), and the fact is that a lot of the wealthy people receiving tax cuts already buy everything they want and put their extra money into off-shore investments in order to further reduce their taxes.    Even if the tax cuts are targeted strictly at small business and the middle class, I really have to question if that would provide stimulus to the economy faster than giving tens of thousands of out of work people jobs immediately fixing our infrastructure, which is essential to our GDP.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	They are kind of stuck on tax cut aren't they?    Tax cut helps the wealthy more than the poor.  But its the poor that need the money more and the poor who will spend it immediately (out of necessity) which is what stimulates the economy.    Republicans want less government.  Its easier for the rich to steal our money and take advantage of us without government oversight.

g34x7iKhaa	Karl Benz of Germany invented the first car and the internal combustion engine is attributed to France.  Obama made a mistake last night in his speech.  The news is not surprisingly ignoring it.  I believe the sentence was, "And the country who INVENTED it shouldn't walk away from it."  He got a standing ovation for making a serious historical error.  <br>  <br>  Here is a link for you Obama lovers.  Of course you will still vote people down even though the truth is there.  Just because the media doesn't say anything about it, doesn't mean it isn't true.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/automobile.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ideafinder.com/history/invent...</a>|`|ftQcubGnaa	I guess so.<br>  <br>  Michelle is proud of Germany?<br>  <br>  <br>  Karl Benz from Germany invented the first (gas)car.|`|eHjk9di0aa	Use airplane instead, the automobile wasn't invented in the US.

The automobile was invented in Europe and the first solar power ran motor was invented in France in the late 1800s.  In 1830, the math used to prove solar power was viable was done in France.  Since Democrats like France and the rest of Europe, yes Michelle is probably more proud of Europe than the U.S.|`|noo8vpvzaa	We already knew that Obama was a little lacking when it comes to this country's history (remember the Selma, Alabama thing?)...If he had a decent grasp of American History, he would never have passed this so-called 'stimulus' bill|`|3icRvgM8aa	Michelle should use her lips for a toilet plunger.|`|A2qbzxrfaa	Its obvious the only way for Michelle to be proud of this country is if more black folk hold office.

You need to talk to the unit clerk about it.  Units that are scheduled for deployment usually put out a letter asking for volunteers from their home state to fill vacancies they may have.

I am heading to Afghanistan this year as a volunteer with another unit. Watch out Afghanistan, here I come again!!!!!
uxu8qJUYaa	I remember the 105 Freeway in Southern California, proposed way back in the 1960's, it took what, 25 years to get up, and before it was opened, the wasted time by filming "Speed" on it.    But yes, give them a paint brush and see what they can do.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	It won't.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	Yeah  It's long term investment  The short term high yield investments finally took a dump on US.

But most of his plan wouldn't even begin until 2010 and going up to the year 2019.  His plan is so flawed that it seems like nonsense.  As if a high school kid conceived it.  Not an adult.  Actually I think high school kids would do a better job.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	for each person who gets that job, they, and their family, will be grateful!!|`|AA10264185	During the post war period Republican President Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway system. This put hundreds of thousands to work and built a lasting legacy. It spurred an economic boom that lasted for a couple decades. That system today is crumbling and falling apart from neglect and lack of maintenance. Bridges are literally collapsing. This compromises public safety and is prevents economic growth. There is enough work just bringing the deferred maintenance on our existing system up to date to get plenty of people back to work and money into the economy.|`|gE03TUtQaa	Stop Globalization and spending Today talk to your Congressmen  to long this early.|`|2d66454da71ea52f9302b902d6991747aa	It will put some people into jobs.    But you're right.  It's a stop-gap fix, not a long-term solution.    The problem with any tax-funded job is that it removes money from the wealth-creating segment of our economy and, in this case, transfers it to the infrastructure segment.    Most government jobs do NOT create wealth, but infrastructure is slightly different.  Bridges, roads and other infrastructure items, (water projects, etc) actually do represent wealth in that we'd be poorer without them.  In a way they increase our standard of living.      If you clean your house, you're increasing your standard of living by a large margin.  You no longer have to spend as much time finding things, you feel better about your surroundings, etc.      Bridges and roads are like that.  When you can travel 70mph down a freeway, you're richer than if you had to prod along down a dirt road with tire grooves, puddles and dips at 10mph.    Plus you don't have to drive miles out of your way to the bridge that crosses the river in the big city.|`|HGnWKRzyaa	The workers are getting paid as they work. This will help them have money to spend. Spending encourages consumerism and helps build our economy.|`|HZy629kLaa	Well, they clearly don't take FOREVER.  But simply put, when people are working on it, they get paid for working on it.  And accountants and administrators and IT guys don't need to pick up a paint brush, they do all the other things they'd do, just for a construction company.    Just because YOU don't see it doesn't mean people aren't planning and surveying and getting permits and all the other thing that goes with building things.    Now explain to us how people who are laid off get a tax cut when they have no job.|`|UAW6fd4baa	Its an old antiquated idea left over from the New Deal days and it will not solve the problem of lost manufacturing jobs. But it will line the pockets of local politicians and employers hiring illegal aliens!|`|fh12fkNWaa	Creating jobs that otherwise would not be there gives families money to spend that they wouldn't have had. The job market is bad right now and a lot of people are out of work. Infrastructure projects kills two birds with one stone. Most states already have their list of bridges and tunnels that need repair or rebuilding. They could get those projects going very fast compared to projects that come from the private sector.|`|pgdTmT6caa	It won't help.  What would help is getting rid of NAFTA.  Why can't he see this?  Oh ya I know why.  Obama-Nation that's it.  He has no intention of fixing anything.  He hasn't yet and it will continue this way.  He has no experience and it is showing.|`|RermzbWgaa	It would create some jobs, or at least give more work to workers of such projects, but you are right it will take time to see real effects from such.    The government spending on such projects is significantly inferior to private sector spending in terms of effects on the economy.|`|JCdBSULraa	Infrastructure can mean more than roads and bridges.   I think it's more like technology infrastructure, organizing government and health care and business regulations to expedite the process of tyranny.   If done correctly, it can be done quickly, and it will create many more government jobs.  It also results in an erosion of privacy and protection that puts the patriot act to shame.  Also billion dollar debts are not paid off in our lifetimes, rather our grandchildren will be flipping the bill.|`|AA11450062	First we need to define short term. Short term and long term can mean different things between conservatives and Liberals. A conservative might think long term is next month, Liberals might look a-little more head like four years. I don`t think Obama can fix the economy from the Republicans giving our industrial might to China etc.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	The bailout infrastructure plan specifically targets projects that are "shovel-ready", which is to say projects where the site selection, planning, design, public commentary, and EPA clearence have already been done.    So we can go straight from passing the bill to giving jobs to contractors, laborers, builders, steelworkers, carpenters, factory workers, painters, drywall hangers, etc.|`|a8r4Lodaaa	I would have to suggest an Economics class.  There is a lot to infrastructure and how it is defined and applied to the economy.      One more thing.  Quite complaining!|`|3HEsdw3Gaa	Elementary Economics:    More money spent = better economy in the short-run but problems in the long-run.  More money saved = investment in the long-run but useless in the short-run.    Man A is out of work.  If the government gives him $100, he spends it on food and necessities.  Grocery store makes money, hires baggers and checkers and farmers make money.  Economy is better off.    That's what happens when you pay unemployment.  Let him earn $100 and you get a road out of the deal and a little pride and dignity for the worker too.    Give businesses the money and it trickles down to the shareholders, many of whom do not need it for necessities, so it goes into investments and enters the economy very slowly (if at all) giving no help in the short-run.      If the government wants to, they can find projects quickly.|`|AA10815904	The President has already said that it will take 2 years just for the money to get to the projects. Does that sound like a quick fix? I don't think so.    And then there is no guarantee that all this money is going to help the economy recover.|`|2b3ihDVuaa	Come On, you've got more sense than that!  One week after a person becomes employed h/she gets a pay check.  Getting people employed is the best way to rejuvenate the economy.|`|UVOQWLT7aa	The idea is to give people jobs when the private sector can not. If people are working again they will spend money boosting the private sector so the private sector can start hiring again. That way when these infrastructure projects are completed the economy should at least be on the rebound. I don't know if it will work though because the government isn't the best at being efficient and the jobs may not come quick enough. Also many Americans get "stuck" in the field they've always been in, I find it hard to believe an ex-investment banker is going to pick up a shovel.|`|mGZCXPbTaa	The building of infrastructure build the economy in two primary ways.    1. Job creation.  You are right, it takes years to build and/or repair bridges, roads, rail, etc...this is years of people having jobs when the jobless rate is over 7%...this is a very good thing.  I can tell you from experience, if you are out of a job, and have been for a time (or have no hopes of getting a job soon) you will take what you can get...yes giving a paintbrush or shovel to a white collar worker will help pave the road for a better economy (pardon the pun).  Also, how many of the people losing their jobs are white collar workers...most are laborers and blue collar workers    2. If you delve a little deeper, you will see that the administration would like to see NEW infrastructure built to include public transit.  This increase in public transit allows for more jobs to be had in maintaining the new infrastructure, running the trains/busses, etc.    Oh and Killer Queen...within 18 months is by June of 2010...so according even to you the plans are on track to be started on time.    This is not the be all end all plan, but it is a start along the right track.|`|HobgsxXCaa	You would have to be a friggin idiot to think that short turn quick fixes are going to work.  First it will take over a year of planning before any work starts and what are they going to do with 7,000,000 people when the money runs out and the government lays everybody off after two years.    Please don't be stupit enough to say the economy should be better then because 7,000,000 people laid off at one time will be worse that it is now.

I once used a liberal democrat to chock my tire and it rotted my tire.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	Here's the problem. When you say "good ideas" it has two meanings. Good for the country or good to get elected. For the last 8 years Republicans have focused on what's good to get elected. To be fair this was a change from the glory days of the Republicans under Reagan - those guys were for the good of the country. Now Obama is focusing on the good of the country even though it's unpopular to many Republicans.|`|BquqToGaaa	The Republican Party at this moment, is the gift that keeps on giving.  Denying that humans have a hand in changing climate & wanting to continue to be dependent on fossil fuels,regardless of where they come from is ridiculously backward. Supposely smart minded people wanting to support  policies of the last century is puzzling.  But if you ignore science, that is the result you get.  As long as they maintain that stance, they will lose election after election.

We republicans use proper grammar.|`|Q7ovix19aa	They have good ideas but they don't sound good to todays spoiled and sheltered ivory tower elite.  They need candidates like Obama who look, sound, and feel good.  That's what matters most to today's voters.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	News flash, Global warming ain't happening.

No one said not to develop something better, but to drill US Oil while we are looking.        SFC  U Army  Retired|`|HZy629kLaa	No.  What they have is working so well for them.      Seriously, some of the party intellectuals are aware of the problem; it is the rank and file we love Palin supporters that are clueless.|`|ttI7pyG3aa	Casting aside your obvious bias, I'll try to answer.    First, I doubt you will find many republicans not on board with the search for a viable alternative fuel.  But we are going to need an energy source to bridge the gap between now and when that alternative fuel can be mass produced.    Continuing to buy oil from countries that hate us is mind-numbingly stupid when we have the reserves and resources here to supply our own demand. But we have to relax some of the ridiculously stringent rules forbidding drilling in so much of our available lands.  That's where the "drill baby drill" came from.  And it makes sense.|`|7qH1QGbmaa	You don't realize how the real world works, and the amount of  power money holds over peoples lives. Sure the hunt for technologically advanced fuel is exciting and challenging but there is still far too much money in oil, so people that own the rights to all of the new cutting edge technologies, or ways to obtain them are going to say "Drill baby drill" until all the money at the bottom of that well is dry, and then they will be there to save the day with this new technology that we are going to have to pay an extreme premium for because we are in crisis. Your main flaw is to think big corporations that rule the country give a damn about you or anyone else for that matter.|`|qh6hlJZtaa	My 2 gay dads say it's impossible to use republican and good idea in the same sentance.

75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	Well, I am a moderate as well.  A moderate conservative.

And I wasn't thrilled with her, but I supported McCain, therefore I supported the ticket.  <br>  <br>  But I do not blindly rally around ANYONE simply based on their political affiliation.  A candidate needs to earn my vote based on their actions, views, vision and record.  I am blinded by NOTHING, and I do my own research on the candidates, being careful to avoid bias.<br>  <br>  So what we both need to do is find a good moderate candidate who wants to put the concerns of all Americans above petty partisan bickering.

Here is the thing, Socialism never works and Mr. Obama is all about socialism. Paln and Jindal are American at heart, they believe in the American Spirit, freedom of speech and such like. Not like Mr. Obama and his henchmen trying to put the fairness doctrine back in place to stop the conservatives from putting a spotlight on the upcoming socialism, Mr. Obama's trying to stifle it. Example from last night, he said something to the effect that everyone will graduate from high school! Sounds great right? NO! So now we have another rule from BIG GOVERNMENT! You will have no choice now on what to do with your life and the next thing you know they will start telling you what Job you will have after you are made to graduate high school,  they want to own you and control your lives.

They continue to tear down any middle of the road thinker, and simple minded Americans vote what Oprah or Katie tell them too.  <br>  Have you listened to Palin or Jindal?

You can stretch out one or two of those easily to make your length requirement.|`|ZTVmUb4Laa	I don't personally believe that abortion should be illegal... but the argument could be made I suppose that some women use it as a form of birth control when there are other options available, such as adoption.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Definition of life is good. Most pro-lifers believe that life begins at conception, so I would begin with that.<br>  <br>  But, "comparing abortions since roe v wade to deaths in Jewish holocaust"? What on earth? I wouldn't include that, particularly since this seems to be an assignment. It'll sound like you've been listening to talk radio instead of doing real research, and I doubt you can prove the assertion. I can't imagine what you would use to do so and I can argue the pro and con of just about anything.<br>  <br>  Pain for the fetus is a good one, put it after definition of life. Methods is shakier... if you're going to discuss partial birth abortions I would skip it. They're very rarely performed and never as an elective procedure, meaning that they're only done when the mother's life depends on it. That doesn't make a very good basis for arguing against abortion.<br>  <br>  Fetal development sounds like it should go with pain for the fetus and definition of life. Really, that should be your central argument. If life begins at conception, abortion can be defined as murder under the law. But, if life begins after a certain point, abortions before that point would be legal. So that's your most powerful argument. I would devote about half your essay to that. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get some information from a reliable, medical source about fetal development. You know those billboards or cards you see from pro-life groups that show a little fetus? That's not actually a fetus. It's a pre-mature infant, capable of surviving outside the womb. Most advertisements like that are just propaganda. You'll want to use real medical information.<br>  <br>  You might also want to discuss alternatives to abortion. That would give you the rest of your paragraphs. After all, women will still get pregnant with children they don't want if abortion is illegal. So how would you help them? More access to contraceptives to prevent the pregnancy in the first place? More safe drop-off points for unwanted infants? But then what do you do with those children once they're placed in foster care? You'd probably have to extend the adoption system, but how? By lowering the restrictions on adoptive families? By allowing gay couples to adopt? Maybe an information program aimed at convincing more couples to adopt? My point is: ideas for preventing abortions or dealing with the unwanted children should be a central point of any argument against abortion.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Focus on when life begins and on how to prevent/deal with unwanted pregnancies and you should have a good paper. Message me if you'd like more help.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Possible physical and emotional effects on the aborter.<br>  <br>  Alternative options (adoption, abstinence etc.)<br>  <br>  Don't listen to people like JOKR8790 if you believe it should be illegal.

And after they found it was easy to trade opium for those goods, Hong Kong even grew in importance.|`|r6gqrZkraa	if you want a plain and simple answer.<br>  <br>  because they could, and it gave them a naval base on the other side of the world.|`|04e064b1e27b063681444d2c731a008daa	so England could get free tea.|`|KKH9y0ECaa	The UK had Hong Kong as part of a 99 year lease agreement with China.

KKaggQr7aa	There is no such procedure, just have all ur documents ready including ur HSMP approval letter, & simply apply for visa in UK High Commission in Canada. If they will require an interview, they would call you. Normally if all ur documents (for visa u need all original documents that u sent for HSMP approval + approval letter) are complete they wont require an interview. Visa can take up to 15 working days.     Good luck.
