60a4bc52c72a25d900fb1f94a1a6f3c0aa	Yes.  You just have to make sure it is in the right format.  You can play Quicktime movies and MPEG4 movies on your iPod.    In iTunes click on 'File'  Select 'Add File to Library...'  Find where your video is saved and select it and press 'Open' or 'Add'.  This will add the video to your iTunes library.    When you update your iPod make sure the blue box next to the video you just added is checked in your iTunes library. This will put the video on your iPod.|`|fcd786a87b43a62477827e3b2c7073e3aa	try this:    http://www.xilisoft.com/ipod-video-conve...|`|af4005ad9e715533cc54e47d58984720aa	You sure can.

There's an MP4 converter on www.download.com search for "Videora Ipod Converter" (which is free) and download it. Once you've converted your videos into MP4 format, drag them to i-tunes and they should upload to your ipod.|`|AA10538368	You will have to download two free programs though called DVD Shrink and Videora. Go to www.afterdawn.com and type in the search box DVD Shrink. This program is used to rip the movie off of your dvd. NExt, go to www.videora.com and download Videora. This program converts video files to the mp4 format, which is the correct video format for the ipod. IN DVD Shrink after it rips your movie off the dvd, make sure you save it in a place where you'll know where it is, for instance in the my videos folder. Next, go to Videora and open up your movie file from wherever you saved it and it will convert it for you You will have to pick a place for it to be saved once again (change the name so you dont et the ripped movie mixed up with the converted movie. that can be done before you convert it just change the name). Then go to iTunes and open up the converted movie file in iTunes and update your ipod. You can also use Videora to convert music videos to the correct format. Good Luck!! If you need my assistance just im me or email me. I'm tooraw88

38cef1264fe5e1a15ea2b02e667666cdaa	I had a similar problem with my ipod when our computer crashed and we lost everything on the hard drive and got a brand new computer. If we load a fresh copy of itunes on the new computer and hook up ipod, itunes would wipe out the existing ipod. I ended up buying a software called iPodCopy (it was like $17). It copies all the songs first from iPod to your PC (do NOT connect iPod to iTunes yet!). If you get iPodCopy, it gives you full instruction on how to load the songs from ipod to pc, then load these songs into itunes. After you have loaded songs into itunes, then you can wipe out the ipod and resync with itunes.

Ontrack Fix-It-Utilities to retrieve your lost data.    NEVER MAKE ANY CHANGES to your phone's memory before the restoration is completed as the space where your lost data was may be overwritten!!!    The fact is i tried this on usual drives and it did work, i only dont know whether the space where sms's and other stuff is stored can be accessed NOT from the phone.    Anyway try this if what you deleted is important to you!  good luck!

AA11549416	Works fine for me, check your account to be sure payment is set up correctly.  Can only be played in a 5th generation iPod and can't be played in iTunes. Also try upgrading iTunes, the new release is out.      Also there are some free games on the Web, see link below.   As a side note, the next gen iPods announced recently will come with new games, I believe there will also be a software update for 5th gen iPods.      From MacWorld:  Games have long been included on the iPod, but theyve been pretty basic. Now that premium games are available in the iTunes Store for all fifth-generation iPodsincluding the latest iPod with videothe big question is, are they worth $4.99? The answer may surprise you. Peter Cohen has a first look at iPod games.      The iPods software has also gotten an update. The iPods new search feature lets users use the scroll wheel to input letters for an instant live search of all the content on that iPod. The new Quick Scroll feature displays a rectangular overlay of the letter youre currently scrolling through, if youre scrolling quickly through an extremely long list of items.    As with iTunes 7 and the new iPod nanos, these new iPods feature support gapless playback, allowing one track to flow seamlessly to the next without a pause in-between.

ProAc (particularly the Response Series -the old 2.5 is a gem with the right gear) loudspeakers are one of my favorite speaker brands of all time.  Keep in mind when you drive ProAcs, they can be finicky with some electronics, so choose your gear carefully.  For a little insight, Naim and Arcam work well with ProAc.    I also like Silverline Audio, like ProAc, are extremely musical.  What I like even more about Silverline speakers are that they are very easy to match up with a variety of electronics -very easy to drive.    I also have other favorites from Wisdom Audio, Nearfield Acoustics, and JMlab, but these are in a higher price level to start (except for JMlab) and need a large room to work effectively.

AA11549416	Opening the shell of the iPod is not an easy task; I'd recommend asking someone who has done this before.   You could rupture the battery or potentially cause harm to yourself.  Rechargeable batteries can be volatile when wet. See link below on one that exploded when the teen opened it carelessly.    Three very water sensitive points are the battery, the mini-drive and the contact point in the middle of the wheel, sometimes even a little moisture can ruin the contact point on the wheel.   Some have to replace the battery.        The towel damping is a good idea, however a hair dryer not set on hot might work better.   Leave it in a warm, dry spot (near a dehumidifier) for a week to allow it to dry out . . . sometimes works sometimes you have to buy a new one.    Bottom line though is the problem should be addressed immediately by taking it to an Apple store and having a technician take it apart to check it.   Trying to turn on a wet iPod may cause more problems with shorting out of components.  Neither I nor anyone else on the Internet can provide you with safe instructions for taking apart an iPod and repairing wet parts.|`|3d7b59f1218472ca7e66cbb616a0cca1aa	Carfuly take it apart and dry it of with a soft cloth do not rub just pat it till its dry. BE VERY CAREFULL!!!!
AA11549416	One possible solution:    Usually "Can not be played on this computer" happens when iTunes thinks you have copied an ITunes song from one computer to another without checking it out from the iTunes store.   You do have rights to a limited number of copies on different computers, you just have to register the song.  If you bought this song off iTunes, it has become unauthorized on your computer.   Go into the iTunes account you used to pay for the song and reauthorize the song.  I believe in this case you can click on the file that can't be played and it will offer an option to authorize.    If this song wasn't purchased from iTunes, then you need to delete the file and import it again from your CD.       There are other possibilities, however these 2 are the most likely causes.|`|b1a2cefd56accaea26f011f723c43ab8aa	contact apple

AA11549416	Yes, but use with caution.  If you accidentally overlay system files it could be a problem.       Step 1 - Connect your iPod and start iTunes  Step 2 - On the summary page, check "Manually manage music and  videos" scroll down to see the checkboxes - in the older iTunes software this appears slightly different   Step 3 - Click the Apply button  Step 4 - Close iTunes  Step 5 - Open your computer file manager (e.g. Windows Explorer)  Step 6 - Your iPod (still connected) should now appear as a new drive  Step 7 - Copy the files you want to store on the iPod into one of the directories in the iPod drive that appears on your computer    You will need to reset your iTunes setting to enable the normal sync of downloads (e.g. Podcasts)
AA11549416	"The Apple iPod H-Fi is an Apple product through and through." states one reviewer.   "Apple spent some time with an in-house team in creating a durable and well-constructed speaker system, with a sealed, tuned, and double-walled enclosure, plus separate cabinets for each driver. "   That says it for the cabinent and assembly, but not for all the individual parts.    They do use contract with suppliers for parts, but at the lower part level I wouldn't expect any big name manufacturers that you have heard of before.  The question remains is who made the speaker drivers that went into the cabinent, I'm betting that the round speaker drivers were built to Apple specifications by some manufacturer who already produces speakers for other companies.   Apple isn't saying who makes all the parts.

8e18aff26751179698b4c00ba2085ec4aa	With bittorrent, you can find almost anything but the files can take a while to download. Also, larger files tend to be on bittorrent, such as whole albums as opposed single tracks.    You will need a client to download the files. I recommend utorrent.  http://www.utorrent.com/    and search for files here:  http://www.torrentz.com/    You will download a small file (.torrent) using the torrentz.com site which will open up utorrent for it to begin downloading what you want.      I would try not to use programs such as Bearshare (especially), because they are known to put spyware on your computer. I find using bittorrent much easier and as having a fuller library of downloads. Often the speed are much faster, too, because they aren't limited by the program.|`|6de6d242a0bd9b90c2644d3f6bafdc58aa	In my opinion, no.

AA11549416	Not sure if you are referring to viewing the lyrics in iTunes or on your iPod.    You used iTunes to Get Info, not all info in iTunes is available on your iPod though.  Album art and limited information is passed on to the iPod.   You should be able to right-click and select properties on your song and see the lyrics from the iTunes software on your computer.   If the form is blank, then perhaps the lyrics were lost or not applied for whatever reason.       As an alternative, you can manually push the lyrics as a text file to your iPod, however you can not pick lyrics from your song view on the iPod.

AA11549416	Could be a couple of problems, software that can't recover from I/O errors or security on the video that the program can't handle.   There are 2 suggested approaches below (one is freeware and the other is trial-and-buy software.  Also if this is from a DVD disc, be sure the bottom does not have too many marks on it.   I find that certain software packages work find with some videos, but can't seem to handle others.  Also check Puma for software patches or updates to the software as well as the support forum for similar problems.      1) If the video is not MP4 format (e.g. a DVD movie you own), then you will need to convert the video.   There are a couple of choices for conversion, some work better than others and some have a license cost.       Here are 2 choices you can pick from:  Freeware:    Videora is my first choice because it is free, however it is more difficult to use and sometimes buggy on selected DVDs.  I'd try this one and if it doesn't work out for you then buy a more reliable solution.    Videora.com provides step-by-step instructions, follow them carefully:  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/g...    Shareware (trial and buy $46):  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/download/...    Nice thing about pay-to-use software is it has live support and an excellent support forum:  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/other/sup...    (SKIP TO THIS STEP IF YOUR VIDEO IS ALREADY IN A MP4 FORMAT)  2) After ripping the DVD or video into a MP4 format, then you will need to import into iTunes.   If you don't have iTunes, you can download a free version iTunes 7 onto your computer.    Import the converted MP4 files (try to remember where you ripping software placed the files) into the iTunes library.   FILE-->IMPORT    3)Finally connect your iPod to the computer with the iTunes software running.   If the iPod update doesn't run automatically, you can manually start it by FILE--->UPDATE iPOD.   After the update you should be able to find your video in the iPod menu as VIDEO-->MOVIES.   The properties in the iTunes library does control where the file lands in the iPod menu, so be careful if you decide the change the file settings.|`|AA11865862	I would Use videora ipod converter to convert your movies.

AA11549416	One of the video Podcasts called GeekBrief talks about taking apart your iPod, her example was a screen replacement.    You would still pay quite a bit for the Apple part with no guarantees that it would fix your problem.   I would imagine that leaving in the car might also cause problems with the battery.  Unless it is an expensive iPod (e.g. 30Gb), I'd be tempted to replace.
AA11549416	Not unless you want to run iPodLinux or Rockbox both of which can invalid any warantee on your iPod.   Personally never saw the value of games on the iPod, controls just not optimal for game playing.   I'll stick with the Nintendo DS.       From the link below:  "While FairPlay provides encryption protection for music and video, iPod games aren't a simple monolithic file to be encrypted, so the security model is entirely different."|`|0ae9a6ac51a8f280b7fbde1c3c5dd823aa	Odd.  I downloaded a game and added it to itunes w/o a problem.  I haven't checked if it transfered to the ipod, but I didn't get any errors.      Did you add the games to your itunes library?  If so, does it show in itunes the game and instructions?

All three have music players however the 6630 also has realplayer.   They are all bluetooth enabled which is handy however the 6630 does not have infared as a feature. The all have gprs.

AA11549416	The iTunes Store interface certainly improves the capability to pull album art automatically.   Have you tried the "Get Album Art" option off an individual song, I don't believe you have to login to the store for album art.    If you can find the album art graphic file somewhere on the 'Net, there is a manual method to add it to the song's properties.   Certainly much more time consuming.

0Z4vqlqUaa	Hi Brooke,    There is a camera for everyone, whether your budget is $100 or $3000.  I found a great store that has a lot of versatile Mini DV Camcorders.    I found out that they are the same company who makes some of the major bands but also has a no name brand to cater for folks who are not interested in brand name but Results.    They have camcorders for under $100 and up all including shipping and has a 12mths warranty and a return policy.    For better results pick one with 3.0 Mega Pixel or more    you can check them out at:  https://www.myminidigitalcamcorders.com     Hope this helps.|`|3CJAUyqPaa	A pocket camcorder will be fine if you do not expect much from it. With th smallest lenses and imaging chips it will not do well in low light. I do not know what you mean by "mid darkness".    The ranges of camcorders:    Up to $250 = low-end/entry level. Generally no mic jack, no manual control, poor low light behavior, no stabilization.    Up to $600 = entry level consumer. Some Canons in this range have a mic jack but no manual audio. Low light capture is better than the previous range, but still not so good. Zoom is easy to use but not manual; manual focus, aperture, shutter and others are used through the camcorder's menu.    Up to $1,200 = mid-range consumer. More have a mic jack (but not all), some have manual audio but most do not, lenses and imaging chips are bigger for better low light than the previous range... but not quite there. Manual zoom, manual focus, aperture, shutter and others are used through the camcorder's menu. Sometimes the zoom and focus share a ring near the lens so you can use one at a time.    Up to $2,300 = Prosumer/high end consumer. 1/8" (3.5mm) mic jack is common for audio-in. Manual audio is available. Manual controls are on the outside of the camcorder for ease of use and access. Lenses are larger - low light behavior is pretty good, but not perfect.    Beyond this are the pro-grade...    So.. is a sub $100 camcorder a good one? If all you are looking for is something that can fit in your pocket and can capture well in low light, then yes. If you want more, you will need to spend more.

AA12396944	You still need the physical phone hookup to your house, but you may not have to pay for a regular phone connection if all you want is DSL.  Each area may have different requirements; check with Verizon.|`|68w3sUKvaa	Verizon has lots of new internet options that dont require landlines.  Depending on what type of phone you have, you can tether it to your computer and use your phone as the internet modem.  You can also purchase an air card (now made for lap tops or desktops) and have a seperate mobile   that would be attached to the aircard.

2dpvUXEsaa	Do you mean where are your songs?     If you need to access them - add/remove songs etc plug your iPod into your computer (are you on a PC or a Mac?) and open iTunes. Your iPod will show up in the menu on the left. When you click on it iTunes will show you what's on your iPod and you can add/remove songs as you like.    If that isn't what you meant could you maybe explain what you're trying to do a little clearer ? :)|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Usually in your My Music Folder, that is if you are using windows

ysiE6IDjaa	Your husband will only get angry with you if he witnesses any displays of affection between you and the other man. This will often happen if you are on the same lot and not even the same room...they seem to have a sixth sense if you are doing something naughty on the same lot, lol! Similarly, the other man will get angry if he witnesses the same between you and your husband. You also have to be careful of any mean sims around when you meet up with your other man. If they see you flirting with him, they may tell your husband.    Also when you have your baby the baby will not have any wants associated with your husband.ie he/she will not want your husband to snuggle/tickle/read to him etc, no matter how good their relationship becomes, because your husband is not the father.|`|AA12358300	I don't think you can get pregnant with other man. other than your husband

N9nJWYa5aa	You can plug in a USB hub into one of the existing ports.  These come in two flavors, unpowered for basic devices or powered (requires) a mains adapter for more power hungry devices such as USB Hard Drives.  Hubs can have anything from 2 to 13 (I have one of these so don't tell me they don't exist) ports.    You can also get USB hubs that plug into Express Card and PCMCIA slots.|`|LClopaGtaa	I use a powered 6 port USB, only takes one opening, you need the powered one for all those. That is the one who's name you are trying to think of.|`|6oli1iF4aa	a USB hub can "split" one USB port into 2 or 4. they do tend to run a bit slower, but it's a cheap solution.|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	You need a USB docking station. This one plugs into an existing USB socket and is called the Kensington SD100 Notebook Expansion Dock.    http://www.itcsales.co.uk/acatalog/Dell_...|`|HOvJHYTtaa	Hi, What you need to buy is a USB hub, the number of ports available is totally up to you as the price will vary accordingly.  You can actually attach up to 256 devices through USB2.0 at any one time believe it or not.  Good luck.|`|AA12180617	its called a HUB - however many devices need to be powered from teh USB port and if you split them into more with a unpowered HUB you get  to a point where not enoough power is sent to the device for it to work. (full power USB has 500mA current and most laptops only send 100ma to USB ports ) so with laptops this is more of a problem.    if you find things do not work  then you MUST buy a POWERED HUB there a mains adaptor powers the USB instead of the laptop so you get 3,4,5 or 7 full power ports than can run , power and charge all devices such as ipods etc.
9AR6B4ELaa	no, it wont damage your ps2. and avoid moving it when its running as the lens might run of track. dont put the ps3 in an upright position as this may damage the lens as it is in an ankward position.    that's all you need to know    pls vote me =)|`|sQdgzYKVaa	It won't damage it at all, don't worry.    Ways to damage it.  1. don't leave it on standby *red light* (it won't damage it but it saves energy and money on your bill.)  2. don't sit on it (hey, i was young when that happened)  3. don't play it for a long period of time.

I found a site that has some instructions on replacing the case. http://www.xbox-modchips.com/xbox360-tut...|`|imaeeL9Naa	The same case just different color.      For opening your case:  http://llamma.com/xbox360/repair/Xbox-36...    Note: I'd just switch your hard drives between the two units.  That way you keep your warranty intact.  I'd only recommend switching the cases if you've done some sort of modding before.  Or your just really desperate and not too concerned about messing up.    ~ Shoe|`|b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	why don't you just switch the hard drives?  Unless the white one is an older, less reliable model, the only difference in the elite is the black color and the 120 GB HDD.  So Just Switch the hard drives, which is way easier than switching the internal parts.  (Models made after fall 2007 have all the same internal parts, even the arcade version.  The Elite is just painted a different color)|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes, all and i do mean ALL xbox 360 models have the same shell. so you can switch the cases. and i dont think its smart to switch the internal parts as xbox is very sensitive that you might damage it    hope this helped  and i really hope that you will give me the 10 pts to help me go to lvl 5
eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	No I Don't have the homebrew channel...it's technically illegal, and takes money from developers.    Yes it can break your Wii, you should be careful. doing this mod will also void any warranties, Nintendo will refuse to fix it, and you won't be able to sell the system to EB or someother trade-in place like that.    The HomeBrew channel could be great, but Nintendo stands to make more money if they control the content allowed for the Wii.  It allows you to make your own games and play them on the Wii. Cool huh? I wouldn't mess with it though...not unless you have 2 Wiis- one legit...one not ^_^
DU8zxsKRaa	New Wii downloadable content is made available every Monday.  I'd presume that DSi downloadable content would be the same.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Your settings are correct. When you play Blu-ray movies, PS3 converts DTS-HD MA or Dolby True HD and send it as PCM signal to receiver.

SKkE3fK1aa	N85 = All Around  5800 XpressMusic = More on Style but lacks important features.    Buy the N85 if you want to take pictures, watch videos and call, text view images, etc. The N85 also is great for N-Gage 2.0 gaming (http://www.n-gage.com/ check out their games and BE AMAZED). though it lacks the touchscreen features, it still is a great S60v3 Smartphone compared to the 5800.    The 5800 XM, even though it's a touchscreen and have a wider screen than the N85, its internal parts are equal to the N85 (or even less!). See, when you have a bigger screen and a bigger screen RESOLUTION, it takes a higher processing power to facilitate the progress. But, since the Processor of the 5800XM is only minimal, it can only do full power with a Screen Resolution of the N85 and less on the 5800XM. This device is only if you wanna show off to your friends and not care about what a Smartphone can do. Like Word, Excel, PowerPoint viewing and editing, Adobe PDF and FLASH support, HTML Browser, etc.    I recommend the N85 or wait for the N97 if you want a touchscreen smartphone.

AKv1gj0Xaa	It will on occasion, particularly if it has run completely out of juice and you're plugging it in to sync with iTunes. The power from your computer's USB port wakes the Nano up and causes it to reboot, which is what you see when it displays the Apple logo. You can also force the iPod to do a reboot. Apple says:    1) Toggle the Hold switch on and off. (Slide it to Hold, then turn it off again.)    2) Press and hold the Menu and Center (Select) buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 8 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.    This is useful in cases where your system freezes up and you can't get the iPod to respond.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Yep, mine always does.|`|vGyCsllcaa	Yeah. Sometimes
AA10594501	I'll bet the channels that are pixelating are the ones that you got really crappy reception on with analog. Digital reception is subject to what's termed the "cliff effect", where reception is perfect up to a point and then degrades very rapidly. You may need a better antenna, or a rotator to point it directly at the transmitters.    Enter your address or zip code at one of the sites below to see where your stations are located and what type of antenna you may need. If you're over 50 miles away or have terrain or building obstructions, you have to try really hard to get good reception.     I'm not a big fan of the delay in the DTV cutover, but the government really did not do a sufficient job of communicating the antenna requirements.|`|6pjmQ4d7aa	No you just need a HDTV Service (cable or dish)|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	They're hoping that eventually you'll get tired of the free digital tv and switch to cable or satellite.

Bluetooth lets these devices communicate with each other when they come in range, even if they are not in the same room, as long as they are within up to 100 meters of each other, dependent on the power class of the product. Power transmission rates vary in many Bluetooth products depending upon the power saving features available in a particular unit, bandwidth requirements, transmission distance, etc. Products are available in one of three power classes:

O que este programa faz  gerar cdigos vlidos, mas, que n?o est?o registrados. Ent?o ele vai gerando e voc vai tentando pra ver se acha algum.

36b29fed7f111e3c93c0ba826c92fb53aa	Firstly, its best advised to see if Nokia has issued a firmware update which from my experience has always substantially sped up software.  Secondly, having a huge memory card also slows a phone because of the access times to move the data to and from the card.  Its best advised to change the default memory of the phone to the memory card so messages, photos and all applications will be installed there by default.  This enables the phone to use the fixed memory inside the phone as RAM which has shown a positive performance effect.  Lastly, keep closing any applications you have kept open, we all have a habit of exiting an application by pressing the "END" key on the phone, but the application keeps running in the background.  To close these applications, keep the "Menu" key pressed on the phone...this is the key on Nokia Smartphones which takes you to the icon grid menu, once you see the list on the top left, close the applications one by one by pressing "C" on the phone.    All this will surely help...|`|225da22b9e2dad8b14715375285ee56aaa	u better by 512 mb card.there is no alternative way|`|a0973ea60082b5d884a81c5c8dae1c0aaa	If u want some coolstuff m games for ur mobile jus check it out here www.download-easy.blogspot.com|`|c563f22da8e0a2cd1bebf08f3a24b7c9aa	First you have to check the capacity of memory card n70 supports    u have to approach a customer care centre they  may  have a solution. check Ur phone, That  applications are for N70     and check that whether symbian application in your phone is specified for another phone  with symbian|`|f5b2d2933174254a3f7099fb0085e8a1aa	Move major apps you feel important to the phone memory that are small and the rest to the memory module.

Personally I am having trouble with this phone I got two weeks ago, I  got a gift on the scratch card, a CD with 30 songs and a crack code  , which did not work; shows the message "songs' corrupted" did you face any such a problem, just a query.
