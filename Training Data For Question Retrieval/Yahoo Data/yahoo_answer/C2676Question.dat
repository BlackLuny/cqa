20090220041620AAYEPQu	Pets;Dogs	Please help me! I don't know what to do!?	My mom got me a puppy. So far, it was great. Than after 3 months my mother started to get annoyed because of how my dog always gets dirty and stinky (shih tzu). And she never goes outside because the doctor advised that she shouldn't because we found loads of ticks one day after playing with her puppy friend. Sometimes she smells her pee and steps on it and her fur is just..ahh! That's why we cut it but she still stinks! First question:      - how to make it so my dog won't get easily dirty and stinky?      Second question:      - Things to do to make my dog preoccupied and not start having behavioral problems from not going outside.      Third:      - What can I do to make it so she will be happy and not be bored around the house? If I want her to be calm should I be calm? What should I do so she knows I will always love her to death.      Please help me! I'm afraid my mom might take her away from me! PLEASE.

Do you find mice to be friendly & can you keep male/male together?      How about Rats, I hear they are one of the best to have and is better to keep them in pairs? Do the pairs have to be male/female?       I don't mind having a few pets. I don't want to breed them at all.       I will get the biggest cage I can find for them. I am going to adopt them from an non profit no kill animal rescue here in Oregon. I know the lady who runs it. I just want opinions of what other people have enjoyed and why they love their favorite breed of small rodents. I will get the best diet possible for my pets, and they will be in a very safe secure home. They will even get vet care if they are hurt or ill. I have other animals and I know I'll be a good care taker. I am an adult and my husband lets me have whatever pet I want. :)

20090220035641AAYGFsc	Pets;Cats	Why has my neighbors tomcat taken a liking to my spayed female cat?	I have two cats - one male and one female, both fixed.  They are inside/outside cats, as I keep them inside for the most of the day.   My male cat only goes outside to sit on the porch with me (he loves sitting on the swing!) but my female cat likes to go outside to use the bathroom and climb trees in my back yard.  I found her as a stray and the vet said she has probably been living outdoors for several years, so I don't try to keep her cooped up too much.  I know she really would rather be playing outside.  But she comes in for the night, usually stays just in the backyard, and I would say she is inside for 3/4 of the day.   HOWEVER, my neighbors bought a russian grey male and they let him roam around outside.  I know he is not yet fixed because she was asking me if I knew of any good places to take him to.  But now, when I let my girl kitty outside to play, this little guy follows her around!  It's almost like they have fallen in love!  Which is fine - she is shy at times so finding a friend would be okay and she is fully vacc'd and spayed so I have no worries there....Except last night she did not come back inside! they just kept following each other around all night until they fell asleep together and this morning they are at it again!  When I try to gocatch her or scoop her up they run off! They stay in my yard though, and he always is the one to come running to her.   any idea why he has taken so much interest in an "unavailable" girl?

I called the guy I rent it from earlier today, and asked him if I could have one, but he was rather negative, due to another previous renter, who had left behind a hamster, which was found a few weeks after he had moved out.      His main reasons to be negative was these:   - The fur could come anywhere. (He thought especially of the allergic people)   - Damages on the apartment      I want to send him a letter, with arguments for why I should be allowed to have a pet. This is what I have come up with:      - I will be living in the same apartment for at least 1,5 more years.   - If any damage would be done to the apartment, I will get it fixed myself, without him even getting involved.   - I am an animal-person. I've had dogs, cats, rabbits and even a few turtles throughout my whole life. Now that I live by myself, I feel rather lonely. I kinda need an animal to keep me with company when I get home from work.   - I have good experience with animals, know how to treat and take care of them.   - I have my own entrance to my place, so there will come no fur or anything in a hallway if others are allergic.   - I can agree to clean and vacuum the apartment more often than I all ready do.      If anyone got some more arguments, or got anything else to say, please send me an answer ;)

20090203124428AACQRKw	Pets;Dogs	I have an english bulldog that is 9 months old. He is very playful! ?	Don't get me wrong! I LOVE having a playful puppy! We have so much fun and we always try to stay active! I was just wondering about this because I have heard from several people that when we get him neutered, that he will calm down a lot! Which would be good. SOmetimes he gets a little carried away and we are teaching him to "play nice" around my 2 year old niece and 3 year old nephew. He is trained and when we tell him "no" and "down" and things like that, he will calm down and obey us, but sometimes he is just so aggressive even though he is only being playful. Is it true that when we get him neutered that he will most likely calm down and be a little more docile??

Based on the following symptoms, does anyone know what kind of disease is this:      The cat likes to be alone and stay away from other cats even its siblings.

Within one to two days, it will die.      Then after a few days, other cats (normally its siblings) will get the same sickness.      What kind of sickness is this?

What are the preventive measures that I can take so that the other healthy cats in the same house will not catch the same disease?      What is the source of the disease? Is it from foods or the air?

I was taking proper english lessons but now have my own and can't afford weekly lessons, if I focus excrutiatingly hard, I can get it straight under me but it's not pretty.      Thanks in advance for the help.
20090203122824AA2xrIl	Pets;Dogs	What Food Do You Think is Best For a Border Collie?	Hi, I have 2 border collies (non working). 1st is around 5 years and 2nd is about 1 year old. The youngest one had some flatulence problems and my local store suggested Royal Canin complete dry food. They said it was very easy to digest etc and was the best on the market. Well, the flatulence has gone and they seem to enjoy it but it is rather expensive.   So wanting the best for my 2 boy's, is Royal Canin all they claim or do you think there is something better suited to a collies needs?   Thanks
20090203123515AAFeAXW	Pets;Fish	I bought a NEW fish tank and the water is so gross?	I've had fish tanks in the past (10 gallon aquarium) and they've never gotten like this.      Within 1 week, the water has become extremely cloudy. I only have 2 fish in there. I bought a new cartridge for my filter, used water treatment liquids in it... nothing has worked.      Could it be the ornaments?      Could it be the tank? The reason I ask this is because inside of the tank, where the faces meet at the 90 degree angle, there's a glue there. It's really soft glue, but there's a lot of it. My previous tanks never had that.      The water keeps getting worse. Should I buy a new tank and try that out? Or what? I'm confused.

20090203122909AAU721O	Pets;Dogs	High performance dogs + feeding?	I have two beagle mixes and since we moved out in the country and they run our property they have been losing weight.  I switched them to a higher performance feed which seemed to help some and they had just been dropping fat and toning muscle but now one of them is really looking lean.  Like greyhound or thoroughbred lean.  Should i switch to a different brand of food or what sorta things can i add to their regular dog food to bulk them up.  What do like working sheep dogs or racing grey hounds eat?  They were on Eukanaba Adult maintenance, then we went to their brand of adult performance.  They are the most fit and healthy as i've ever seen them in seven years, i'd just like to put about 3 pounds on the one and maintain her despite her working level.

I have a really huge Newfoundlander/Flat Coat Retriever cross and he has super thick black fur and it is winter where, snow and all, so he has his winter coat on. His hair is super long.. and i keep trying to brush him but a lot of his undercoat won't come out due to the natural thickness of it and him needing it to stay warm in this weather.   Anyway, I'm thinking maybe his dandruff can't naturally fall out because of his hair.. if I bath him will it help a lot, or irritate his skin more?   Also it is not so much his food's fault.. I got him hypo allergenic dog food and dog treats because I know he is sensitive to wheat and stuff from previous years.   (He isn't very old, just turned 2)      Any suggestions?

20090203124138AAeNGSt	Pets;Dogs	18 month old springer showing aggression at dog park?	My 18 month old male (neutered) springer spaniel has recently started to show what I think is aggression at the dog park. He used to be fine and play with all the other dogs.  I am concerned because the last few times I have taken him to the dog park he barks at the dogs and gets mad when they are not chasing him.  If they are chasing him he's fine. But when they stop he runs at them and starts playbiting but takes it too far. The other dogs get scared and yelp and then he'll stop but start again.  He has shown no aggression at all to us or my brother in laws dog who he playbites with for hours on end.  Lately he has also started to take a dislike to certain people - he doesn't growl at them but he barks - and it's only certain people. I've also noticed that when he takes his playing too far and the other dog barks meanly - he stops. It's only with the really submissive dogs that he "bullies".  He is a very gentle and loving dog and I am very worried because I don't want to have a "bully" dog.  I am thinking about getting a trainer to come to my home but want to make sure I am not overreacting. He has never bitten a dog and hurt it....he just barks and mouths at dogs who want nothing to do with him......but is this how aggression starts?

After the first bite he was taken to what I erroneously considered to be a reputable canine behaviourist {less than useless}.      After the second bite he was taken to a vet for a thorough check up to see if there was a medical reason for his behaviour. Remus was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour & on veterinary advice was put to sleep.      On his good days Remi was a fantastic Dobe, but his increasingly erratic behaviour made controlling his environment very challenging.

As the price of science diet keeps going through the roof (now $15.99/bag) - we're looking for a less expensive alternative for a low magnesium cat food. We have a munchkin cat (we don't know how old he is) we got him almost 3 years ago and we were told he was 5 or 6... But we brought him to the vet and the vet said he's at least 12 and could be as old as 15.   When we got him we couldn't find the food he was on with his previous owner so we gave him kit'n kaboodle... Well that apparently had a high magnesium content causing crystals to build up and he stopped urinating for a two days - we immediately switched him to science diet with a magnesium content of .08% and he's been functioning normally since.   My question is - does anyone know a good cat food with a similar magnesium content - I know Iams has one with .1%, but I was wondering if there's another out there with even less?    I've already web-cruised and couldn't find much (a lot of brands don't list magnesium content)       Thanks for your help!

He would just go up to them and then swim away. He put one in his mouth and then spit it out and swam away. I took the fish out and now I have them in another tank. Ever since then he hasn't really wanted his food. He ate some freeze dried shirmp, but they aren't very big and don't fill him up. I'm feeding him the exact same stuff as always. He isn't as active as he usually is. Just kind of mopes around. He also looks like some scales ar flaking, but he zooms around the tank at night and plows into the gravel so they could just be scars.

I was like "what's going on?" and then this persisted for a few days, and i was getting worried, anyway so few days later i was getting really anoyed as he'd hadnt had any execerice for 3 days and he was starting to anoy people by taking shoes and just generaly running around. so i held him by the colar so he wouldnt sit down put the lead on him and just pulled his colar out of the path and on to the street where then he happly walked to the park. Its  a constant battle every day to take him to the park, although it's fairly easy to hold him and get him to the street and start walking. im just a bit puzzled why? i really dont understand why he does it. At the park he's fine, doesnt get in any fights, he's just a regualr dog, and runs around the field playing fetch with the stick, and he always near me and he hasnt had any fall outs with dogs so i really dont know.

Also there were 3-inch 10 carp-like fishes and the adult tiger barb keep chasing them and he nips them, is the adult tiger barb is just aggressive or they are not yet acquainted? Can they be tank mates or not? Should I still need to add more adult tiger barb so that he cannot nip the carps? Also since the adult tiger barb chases the carp, the carp also chases the baby barbs, are they playing or not or the carp wants to eat the baby barb?

I thought that he was a fuzzy lop, but his ears dont lay down, they stand up. One of his ears layed down when he was a baby but then it eventually went up with the other one. Hes very small only about 2lbs and about 6 or 7 months old so I dont know how much bigger he will be getting. Maybe hes an American Fuzzy Lop mixed with something? I just dont know what. Any rabbit experts out there, maybe you might know. Also, does anyone know how long they generally live for?      Heres some pics    (in 2 of these pics he had just gotten neutered that day, so his eyes look a little greasy since the vet put something on them to protect them, just an FYI)       http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b178/A...        http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b178/A...        http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b178/A...

I have an akita that doesnt really malt but when she does she does! this by far has to be her worst malt yet it doesnt matter how much we brush her she is still scraggy and what will come out on a comb is endless, currently brushing her half an hour twice a day but she still looks untidy and scraggy, as she has double coat you can see where the dead hair is whats moutling and whats not so she looks awful, the other thing is any ideas why they loose weight during moult? she has always done this but I dnt know why, she soon fattens up once her moult is over but looks so untidy in the mean time! there are clumps of fur all over the house, where she lays it feels she has left half of her coat on the floor yet she has no bald patches but anything i can do to make her look a little tidier, perhaps a better product for grooming and also to reduce her weight loss as much as possible, this is her winter coat now she is loosing ready for the warmer weather.

She wont eat and hasnt eaten a whole lot for a couple weeks now. Last night, I read that even Calci-Sand was bad for her so I immediately switched to paper towlels. The temp is about right, I have a lamp and a side heater. The other side of the tank is cooler just in case she gets too hot. At first I thought maybe she had already been impacted, but she pooed last night. I dont know what to do! I think she may have shed a few days ago because there is come skin left on her little feet. I tried feeding her last night, she didnt want any. Which is probably stress from the new tank. Then I tried to feed her this morning and nothing. What do I do?

20090220050820AAf4lSB	Pets;Cats	I have a cat with a possible abscess?	I noticed last night something creamy looking oozing out of my cats leg, I tried to clean it off but it just kept draining, when it finally slowed down enough for me to see there is a small whole around 1 cm wide. It don't look nasty like it is infected. This is such a suprise because if it was an abscess that busted why didn't I feel it before, he has really thick hair and I brush him often and even use a flea comb and have not felt it. Could it be anything else than an abscess?

20090220053956AAkN9SE	Pets;Cats	My cat is weaker than normal  and falling asleep in the litter  box and not eating as much  as normal?	my sister is home and her dog scares the cat when he finds him and chases him and barks at him, we pull him away but when we let him outside he was gone for 4 days with out returning which he never does and when he came back his eye was infected, he isnt eating as much as normal, sleeping MORE than normal and seems to be  very weak. We discovered he had tapeworms and have given him his medicine 2 days ago. When he goes to the restroom, after he is finished he just sits outside or in the litter box and goes to sleep. He is still eating a little and before we let him out he ate alot more. Is this just a sign of recovering from stress outside and tapworms or is it early signs of distemper?

20090220070702AA0WU7s	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone experienced negative effects of new Canidae?	I have been feeding Canidae All LIfe Stages to my bulldog since she was a puppy. Sometime last year (spring?) I noticed the food looked different; larger kibble, more yellowish.        She immediately got diahrhea. I spoke to the retailor who is a friend of mine about the possibility of a formula change. He spoke to his distributor who said nothings different about it.  After that I changed her to Lamb and things got better.      Now I'm reading about problems others had or are having with Canidae and am beginning to replay certain problems my dog had last year.  Keep in mind every problem she's had was followed by a visit to one of the best bulldog vets in my area:      Hair Loss - Dog just had ACL surgery and vet said it may be a result of the stress. Prescribed melatonin for 2 weeks. Problem solved.      Staph Infection - Vet said probably picked up while walking. Prescribed an antibiotic. Problem solved.      Yeast Infection in ears - Medication prescribed. Pretty much went away but her ears are still kinda waxy.       Soft/Yellowish stool - A few times a week but then again I have been giving her more table scraps than usual.      Am I being paranoid now?  There is nothing wrong with her and she looks and behaves as she always has.
20090220070658AA5IEtJ	Pets;Dogs	Husband wants a dog that I don't like very much?	We have 3 cats and a Golden Retriever. My husband said last night he's never had an animal of his own, something he picked out and can train himself. He wants a German Shepherd which is one of my LEAST favorite breeds.      I wouldn't mind so much except that I will be the one caring for the dog all day. He is only at home in the evening. I asked if he could at least pick a dog we BOTH like since the marjority of the responsibility will be mine but he says that defeats the whole purpose.      He wants something HE likes.      Am I being unreasonable? What would you do? He is really set on this.
20090220070926AAaJt8t	Pets;Birds	Is there a bitter spray that is safe to spray on finches to keep them from pecking themselves bald?	Ok so I have 2 female & 2 male zebra finches & 2 society finches. I have them housed in a cage big enough 2 easily house 10 to 12 fiches comfortably. I feed them finch seed & that fruity vitamin fortified pellets & some occasional millet. I religiously change their water dishes @ least 2 times a day. I also mist them with water every day to every other day. They have plenty of toys that they randomly play with & a cuttle bone. They also have 2 of those covered finch nests. I also use that bird litter that looks like fluffed up card board clipping shredded stuff. Well the 2 society finches seem to be in love & they keep to themselves & they don't have any balding. But the zebra's are pecking each other bald its mostly the two males but now the females are getting it too. I was wondering if I could maybee spray them with that bitter spray for dogs that keeps them from chewing on stuff,to keep them from picking @ each other. I was hoping that the bitter taste would make them stop. But is this stuff safe for finches? I read that some people have used it on cockatiels for simular situations. I don't have a spare cage to seperate them. So any advise as to an alternative way to help them other than by seperating them then please let me know. Any help will be apreciated. So thnx in advance.
20090220071126AAx5mi8	Pets;Cats	Cat keep going after kid brother...What should I do?	I have 2 cats and an 8 month old baby.  One cat is great, a little temperamental, but because the other is a ******!  She has always been a bit on the crazy side.  I have had both cats for 2 years now.  Gradually, the mean cat has seemed to have gotten worse.  She is pretty good with the baby except for when the baby pulls her fur or something but otherwise the baby shoves her face right in the cats belly, and I can usually see her getting mad and just move the baby away.  Occassionally the cat will seem frisky and will cuff at the baby but has never scratched her.  But overall the cat is GREAT with the baby and is my cuddle companion at night.  Although she has had a temper with me before and just scratched me out of friskiness.  But never like attack.        The problem: My little brother who is 8 likes to visit my house for the weekend or whenever.  Since I have had this cat she has gradually gotten worse with him and with my other cat.  The 2 cats fight fisciously and do not get along EVER.  She used to let me litle bro pat her and play but started to scratch him on occassion.  Then she would never play nice and always would scratch.  So we just had him avoid her.  But now she is lunging and chasing him.  He literally was running around the table crying out in fear.  So I seperated them and was trying to hold her just now (2 hours after she tried going after my bro) and she just lunged at me.  Now I can NOt have her doing this.  Cat attacked are very serious and scary.  I Love this cat though.  Like I said she is my cuddle companion at night and I will miss her dearly but the only option I see is to let her outdoors 24/7 except at night to sleep or bad weather days or having animal control take her to the pound.  I am torn.  Please HELP!  I love the cat but dont want my poor terrified brother to be afraid to visit.  And I need to trust this ****** around my baby and my future children.  What should I do?

20090220072703AAUTPLY	Pets;Dogs	What breed is my dog?	I adopted a dog and they said he was part hound and part spaniel. i don't have any experience with either breed and I'm trying to determine his breed so I can incorporate it into his training. Ive tried to find pics of different dogs, but not being an expert has taken hours, now I'm just confused. I will describe him. He is a med size, about 40 pounds. He has floppy years to his jaw line. He has a long nose, long body and very agile. He is all black except; white star on face, white with black spots on nose and four "boots" He has a white belly and the very tip of his tail is white. He looks kinda like a lab but has very distinct hound senses, he tracks everything by his nose and points with his tail before a "charge"  Does anyone have an idea as to what type of mix he may be? It would help with his training tremendously! thank you to all who reply
