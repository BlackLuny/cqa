The first year he also hated it due to his job situation.  Now he says he wouldn't move anywhere else.  The job market is still steady in many industries.  The beaches are only about 1 1/2 hours and the mountains (although more like beautiful "hills") aren't much further.  <br>  <br>  Unlike what someone else said, the people are the best!

We usually can't wait to get home to the wonderful people here!<br>  <br>  Housing, like everywhere, has gone up SOME.  But, you still can get a lot for your money, especially on the outskirts (except maybe in Cary and Wake Forest).  Because things have slowed down some, you really should be able to get a good deal.  <br>  <br>  There is so much to do in the area!  Raleigh is a wonderful, small city!  There is a nightlife, you just need to know which areas.  In the Spring, Summer and Fall there is always some kind of free entertainment in the form of street fairs, parades, etc. in downtown.  Plus, you have the wonderful flea market (open year round), the great farmers market, many malls, movie theaters, etc. etc.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	We lived there for three years in the mid 90's.  We rented a townhome while our home was being built.  There was a lot of bang for the buck at that time.  But the Research Triangle Park was a great draw then and it failed and so did the housing market.  I know it is still a good buy in the area as we are friends with our old realtor but not as good as it was.  Homes do not have basements so storage is an issue. The downtown of Raleigh was sad and crime ridden but on the upswing.  The best part of it was that high end people were moving in at that time so high end shopping was building as well.  It was a pristine area but we weren't fond of the local southerners who still looked at Northern folks moving in as "damn Yankees".  If you aren't looking for great theater exeriences, a solid downtown entertainment area or a feeling of fitting in, go for it.  I wouldn't move back ever if it was my choice.We had a beautiful home in a beautiful area with great neighbors from everywhere but the South.  All of our friends and neighbors were Northerners.  I also traveled the entire eastern side of the State in my job and rarely met a good southerner.  We loved the coast but it was two hours away on a good traffic day.  And none of our family and friends ever wanted to come back after a first visit to the area.  That spoke to the area in volumes.to us.  But they loved our home.  We are city folk and the south doesn't offer that so my response may be jaded. Take it for what it is.|`|yB2P9ZS7aa	I can't think of any place I'd rather live than Raleigh.  It had been a dream of ours for years but a lot of life stuff kept us from being able to make the move.  When we finally were able to make the move in 1996 we felt right at home instantly.  The weather makes life a lot easier and the people are so very welcoming and friendly.  Being in real estate here and seeing so many people move here I can tell you our market is very healthy.  It never hit double digit appreciation like other areas in the states and hence it never had a burst.  today our market is softer/slower but it's still very active.<br>  <br>  As for entertainment - this place has done a lot in the past 13 years since we moved here.  Glenwood South is a very popular place for heading out on the town.  Restaurants are sprouting up all over and the BTI has a wonderful theater line up from broadway series to NC Orchestra to the ballet.  Then there's the RBC center for concerts, sports - there's really a lot to do.  <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and at least come and visit!

Survey Spot is legitimate but you'll barely earn enough for groceries. I've gotten paid several times but my checks were only about $65 and it took months. But it's still fun to spend 20 minutes doing a survey and get $3 for it. Some are worth anywhere from $5 to $20 but you'll obviously spend more time on the ones that offer larger rewards. There are a few others but they're more complicated and the rewards might only be 75 cents.<br>  <br>  Unless you are highly skilled in some area of technology, you will have to find a commuter job (as opposed to a stay-at-home job). If nothing else, go to your local mall and do a sweep of literally every store to see who's hiring. Beggars can't be choosers. Some good places to work would include Godiva, Starbucks, and - believe it or not - McDonalds. The latter offers a pretty decent work environment with lots of room to rise. I keep hearing that you can go from fry cook to manager in about a year (if you're a good employee). Holding a managerial position, even at McDonalds, looks great on your resumé and will help you get your foot in the door at your next job.<br>  <br>  Avoiding retail might be difficult at this point. I've heard from no shortage of pissed off former retail employees that it was the worst job. Waitressing is physically tough but it pays well if your expenses are reasonably small. However, experience is usually required for franchises like Applebee's so you might have to start small at a diner or local pub (if you're over 21).|`|FaWlGwcBaa	Go to either snagajob.com<br>  Or MonsterJobs.com they always have jobs in every area code

If there aren't any in your area, you should head over to your nearest AMC and ask Guest Services if they are hiring (don't hand them a resume or ask for paper applications, we don't like that). It's also smart to apply at more than one theater at a time. AmcTheatres.com has a good online job application, but you can't forward a completed application to a different theater, so it's gonna be a hassle to fill in the same application for two or more theaters. It's worth it though.

r9nxFkGtaa	See if your bank will give you a debt consolidation loan, or perhaps a home equity line of credit (if you have enough equity in your home).  Use the proceeds to pay out all credit cards.  Then freeze your cards in a block of ice - you won't be able to spend impulsively, but they are available if a true emergency comes up.  Make as large a payment as possible on the loan - don't just do the minimum.  Ideally, your payment should be the same as the total of all the card payments you were making.  In addition, set aside some money from each paycheck into savings so you will have something for "extras" - don't put "extras" on credit (you can't, the cards are frozen in ice, remember?).|`|zLoyo24Taa	Go to the bank for a consolidation loan. Then make extra payments every month. If you don't want to get a loan, concentrate on one card at a time. Starting with the highest interest or the one with the lowest balance.

Good luck.|`|qjsXrMfHaa	Do not feel embarrassed, many people are in the same situation. If I was you, I would definitely settle my debt. Debt Settlement/Negotiation is when your debt is negotiated in order for you to pay back a lower percentage of what you originally owe. With debt settlement most likely you will achieve savings anywhere from 50-70% sometimes even more. In other words you would be paying back your creditor 30-50 cents on the dollar. Also, since you are paying your creditors less than what you really owe, you will be out of debt much faster. With debt settlement you will be able to save a comfortable amount of a monthly basis and you will be out of debt within 2-3 years or less depending on how much you are saving on a monthly basis. The more money you are able to save the faster you will be out of debt. If you are current with your monthly payments, joining a debt settlement program will affect you credit score because instead of sending monthly payments to your creditors, you are deciding to save that money and use it towards negotiations but also you have to keep in mind that the only way that your creditors will open up for negotiations is if they see that you are delinquent because they will see the hardship. The good thing about debt settlement is regards to your credit score is that it will start increasing again as the accounts are settled. When you complete the program, your credit score will not be perfect because you used a third part to help you but it will be decent and you can always do a credit restoration if you need a good credit score. Think about it and do some research so you can see for yourself how this program will help you become debt free sooner than you ever though you would be.

So, if he tutored someone and that person didn't pass, then he/she might get angry. And the parents might get involved, then the school has to get involve. And then he could get in trouble for solicitation on school grounds without permission. You see where I'm going with this? Just tell him to tutor out of his house or at the person's house.

h3gMzNS3aa	If you get into a top firm they'll often pay for your master's degree because they want you to continue your education while working for them. Sometimes if you're not able to get into a top firm then it doesn't matter whether you have a master's or not, and you'll lose a lot financially.<br>  <br>  The problem with specialising is that you narrow your job prospects. Most law jobs around the world are in corporate and finance law. Many coroprate lawyers used to work in other fields, because they saw how useful the area is and how well it pays.<br>  <br>  If you can afford it and you love the area I'd say go for it, increasing your knowledge never hurts, but if you're doing it as a career move I'd be more cautious. Useful work experience is more important than your degree, especially if by chance you end up not working in the field you studied (I did electives in Japanese law- absolutely no use in my current line). You can get interesting internships in environmentally-based organisations (eg. if you're an activist, work for Greenpeace's legal department).

8J7ehCmiaa	Don't listen to this other guy, he is wrong.  Since we recorded the check in our checkbook as 176 in stead of 167, we subtracted $9 too much, meaning our balance is $9 less than what it should be.  Therefore, the $9 needs to be add3ed to the book because we accidentally subtracted too much due to the transposition.  No if we recorded the check as 167 and it should have been 176, then you would subtract $9 because we recorded it less than what it should have been, meaning our account would be $9 too high.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the answer is added to the book.<br>  <br>  Here's a tip.

For example, when the cash repayment of a loan includes both interest and principal, the interest element may be classified as an operating activity and the principal element is classified as a financing activity.<br>  <br>  Usually, however, interest on short term payables, e.g. on accounts payable, is treated as operating, whilst interest on long-term borrowings like mortgages and bonds is treated as financing.

ds1RoS80aa	In our town, we have an independent, local pharmacy and at least three major chains.  There are a number of things that the local pharmacy does to separate themselves from the chains.  Some relate to the company and some to the individuals, but all work together to give excellent customer service:<br>  <br>  - They are careful to get the prescription right.  We have actually received the wrong medicine twice - once from a chain and once from the local pharmacy.  The chain acted like it was no big deal.  The local pharmacy couldn't apologize enough.<br>  - They keep a good supply of medicine in stock.  Many times I had to wait an extra day at the chains while they special ordered my prescription.  This has never happened at the local pharmacy.<br>  - They are well-staffed and fill their prescriptions quickly.  This doesn't seem to happen anymore, but there was a time when the chain would promise to have a prescription ready in an hour, but it took 2-3 hours.<br>  - They call their customers by name and thank them for their business.<br>  - They help people with non-prescription purchases.  For example, when we needed an ankle brace, one of the employees actually showed us how to put it on for the best fit and support.<br>  - They offer free delivery within the town for those who can't pick up their prescriptions.  They keep a supply of fund-raising candy on the counter, and any profits are used to pay for this service.  I have never used the service, but I am always happy to buy the candy.<br>  - They take the time to make sure you know about the side effects, and they check for any possible drug interactions or allergies.  One time my wife's doctor prescribed a drug she was allergic to.  The pharmacist caught it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Good luck.|`|eg7LAcVwaa	This answer needs to show that you understand that customer service is more than just smiling and being polite to your customers.  The customer needs to feel important and wanted, as well as feel assured that your company/product is reliable otherwise you're not going to have any business.  Ensure that your customer knows if they have any questions or concerns about their product you or someone else can always help them.  The customer should never leave your counter unsatisfied.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your interview!|`|Z49hyPfgaa	Eye contact and make the customer feel comfortable, smiling always helps...

z3TIcyI6aa	No it won't affect your working in a gym or any other line of work APART from those in finance, legal etc  and you can't hold certain positions in a company like director.<br>  <br>  You CANT be fired for becoming a bankrupt and when applying they are NOT allowed to ask about your credit unless it's a job as listed above.<br>  <br>  <br>  It also WONT follow you for life as one poster has said, once discharged you can start to get credit again and the maximum time it will show up on your credit report is 6 years. It does NOT show up after 6 years! The laws have changed from even 5 years ago!<br>  <br>  <br>  It terms of renting yes it can affect you but after your discharged this should help the situation a little and of course after the 6 years it will be a non issue. You can always offer more deposit or see if you get a guarantor to help out. There are ways around it, as other have said like going directly to landlords or look on gumtree etc and not going through agencies. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|L4rlu2BDaa	They can't fire you for going bankrupt especially since your occupation isn't of a financial job. If you were an accountant or banker you'd have problems. If you haven't got a job and are trying to apply for one yes bankruptcy may hurt your application, but they can't use it as sole reason. Be upfront about being bankrupt and that will be in your favour, but your job doesn't entail anything financial so can't see it being too much of a problem.<br>  <br>  It will affect you getting a bank acocunt, you will have to apply for a very basic account with no credit facilities but you'll be able to have wages paid in, but won't have any overdraft or cheque book facilities.<br>  <br>  And it will affect you renting, bankruptcy never looks good on a application, most landlords now ask to do credit checks so you might find getting a house through an agency impossible but if you went through a landlord who advertised in a local paper rather then through an agent youshould find that easier, as they don't tend to credit check as much but rely on knowing you have a secure job and regular pay. It won't be impossible but your looking at a bumpy ride.|`|WgCtyT8uaa	There is no way it shoudl effect your job as a personal trainer.<br>  <br>  One thing i would say about renting a house is that they do a credit check anyway so if you have bad credit it could effect it anyway - bankruptcy won't make it any worse.<br>  <br>  They have relaxed the law on bankruptcy now anyway and you will be discharged after 6-12 months anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck - take the step and you'll feel so much better.<br>  <br>  Lucy x|`|20lCgb6Uaa	If you are in the UK and the debt is on credit cards or personal loans taken out before 1 April 2007 you could get them legally cancelled.

WRvwnBmIaa	Well in high school if given the opportunity take classes related to each of the career choices. You'll figure out which one you like the best that way. That's how I made my decision between Computer Science and Graphic Design. It may seem like you can't choose now but by the time you've taken classes in each of the fields you'll really discover your passion for one more than the others.<br>  <br>  I know Western Washington University in northern Washington has a really great Marine Biology program. <br>  <br>  Forensics I have no idea. I would suggest California Institute of Technology but they're a very competitive school and a very expensive one. I also don't know if they offer a degree in Forensic Science.<br>  <br>  Nature Photography I know there's a few great art schools in Southern California such as OTIS College of Art and Design. If you want to stay up north.

Not only that but you should know there are fees that are added on to your 675 for warranty, shipping, etc.<br>  <br>  If you do want a job though, do odd jobs.  Mow your neighbors lawns, babysit, walk dogs.  There are many many things that people need done but they put them off.  Put up a few flyers advertising your services.

HFKr2vBsaa	Don't use it on anything that you can't pay off at the end of the month.<br>  <br>  You may have intentions of paying it off quickly when you buy a big item but it's too easy for something to happen and you can't. Or you add lots of little stuff. Then before you know it, all of those little finance charges have added up and you have finance charges on old finance charges.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it over again... I'd only get a gas card, it's harder to abuse. And pay everything else with a debit card. At least until you have enough income to pay off your credit card every month.|`|V4JLwTVyaa	Step One:  Buy a pair of scissors.<br>  Step Two:  Cut up credit card.|`|3GHXk05saa	The best way is to use only what you can pay off when the bill comes. That way you're using it but don't have to pay any interest. A credit card is a financial tool for you to use as it fits your situation. Maxing out is bad, and even having more than 50% of your available credit used is not good on a credit report, but it's there for you to use as you need it.<br>  If you're good at being responsible, use the card instead of writing a check when you purchase goods or services and then pay the bill in full when you get it. Just make sure you haven't spent the money in the meantime.<br>  Try to keep a few hundred at least available for emergency car repairs or in case the washing machine dies. That's what a lot of people use them for.<br>  Keep track of if you get points or other goodies for using the card, that makes the deal sweeter.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	It would be best if you would only buy things your really need -- not just want to have-- and it would be best if you pay your credit card in full every month - to avoid paying interest --which is really adding the cost of what you have bought on credit.;|`|6x7zV65Xaa	Thats a good idea, yet I found you can get your self caught up in MAD bills/debt that way.<br>  What i do is make small purchases (gas, groceries, etc) then I pay it off IN FULL each month.

Always pay your monthly balance in full an on time<br>  <br>  If you do those 3 things you will be rewarded with:<br>  1.  Building your credit quickly<br>  2.

qQpBwqMVaa	Hi, If you live around a lot of elderly people they might need someone to help them do things around the house such as cleaning, washing windows, laundry, carrying in or putting away groceries, yardwork, cleaning out garages, raking leaves, weeding gardens, washing cars, walking the dog, etc...You can probably think of some other things as well that your neighbors might need help with.<br>  <br>  Of course a lot of these things can be done for people that aren't elderly. Many people just don't have the time themselves to do it. You could go around the neighborhood and ask if anyone has any odd jobs or chores that they would like for you to do. Many times people will be glad to have the help.<br>  <br>  Just be safe while you're doing this and only go to the neighbor's that you know.

6pXcrSXeaa	In bidding, the highest bidder wins. So for example, the ipod starts at $2. They ask for you to bid and if you are outbid, you will be notified by e-mail. Lets say I join the bid before it closes tomorrow night, I can bid for any amount larger than two. However, if I am really in need of an ipod and I don't want to be constantly updated when someone beats my bid, I can enter a large amount like $60. <br>  You now, will need to refresh your page with the item to see what the other bidders have posted. <br>  Like the above mentioned, you can enter a large amount and this will enable automatic bidding, this is probably what happened in your situation. <br>  Check the link below:|`|ds1RoS80aa	On eBay, you can enter your maximum bid.  If the highest bid for an item is $2.00 and you bid $50.00, it will show as a $2.25 bid.  If someone else then makes a bid that is less than $50, your bid will be raised to slightly higher than theirs.  For example, if they bid $10.00, your bid will be raised to $11.00.<br>  <br>  So what happened is that someone else already had a higher bid before you placed yours.<br>  <br>  Larry (eBay Power Seller)

I've actually received a package before it shows in their system as even being picked up.<br>  <br>  Usually they do get it to you on the original expected delivery date.

I wouldn't worry just yet though.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	I would say that it has not been scanned because of the weekend.  It may not be in Texas yet. Waite and check it after 12pm on Monday.

An agent wouldn't be getting your credit information due to a conflict of interest.  I live in the Dallas area and I would talk to a bank or another agent about this.  An agent would show you houses and a bank or other lending institution would help pre-qualify you for a loan.  New home builders have lenders that they are associated with but they almost never get involved with any part of the process beyond that point.<br>  <br>  DON'T SIGN ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Read everything and look further before you settle with this agent.  This guy may be trying to get you pre qualified but if you don't know for sure, get someone who does and let them help you through the process.|`|NsTEFWcQaa	It sounds like he might want you to sign a buyer agency contract with him. This is a contract between you and the agent. If you were to go to someone else or a for sale by owner and you were to buy a home from them you would still owe him a commission. I do not know why he isn't coming right out and telling you what this contract is about. I am not sure why he would be involved with your loan from the bank. All he needs to know is that you can get a loan and what the terms to the loan are.

5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Ideally, you would put down 20%.  On a $200K house that would be $40K.  That would leave you financing $160K.  According to bankrate.com, today's average for a 30 year fixed loan is 5.26%.  That would give you a monthly principal and interest payment of $884.52.  You also need to take property taxes and homeowners insurance into account on your monthly payment.  You can probably expect property taxes in the range of $1200 per year, and insurance of about $450 (both those numbers will vary depending on your specific situation).  That gives you a payment of about $1022.12 per month for 30 years.<br>  <br>  If you put down less than 20%, you will have to carry private mortgage insurance, which will probably be about $100 per month.  So, if you put down only 5% that would up your total monthly payment to about $1350.|`|GwwDxbfUaa	Go to www.realtor.com and use their calculator.  An average down payment is 10%  more or less depending on your credit and other factors.|`|NsTEFWcQaa	You can put as little as 3.5% down on a home. That would be a FHA loan. Right now the interest rate is 5.5% as of Friday. The rate can change all the time. So lets say you put 3.5% down that is 7,000 making your loan 193,000 at 5.5% interest your principal and interest payment would be 1095.83 Now you have taxes add 1 months worth of taxes on top of that. Now you have to add home insurance. Then if you do not put down 20% you have private mortgage insurance. That is at a rate of .0055% of the while amount that is an additional 91.66 a month. Add all of them together and that is what your monthly payment is.
7FZI95A2aa	Actually, I think FDIC is $250k now.  At least until the end of the year.<br>  <br>  It's doubtful that you'll lose anything, though.  This is NOT the great Depression, despite what the media may be telling you.  During the first 10 months of the 1930 "depression", 744 banks closed. During the entire year of 2008, 25 banks closed.<br>  <br>  Don't panic.  Bring your towel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, according to the FDIC web site, they are still insuring $250k/person/bank.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Here is what you need to do asap.<br>  <br>  Distribute the amount you have into 4 accounts. Each account holds $100,000. This way each account is completely insured by the FDIC up to the max of $100,000 in each account.<br>  <br>  Don't scare your bank... just open up 3 more accounts and move $100K into each account to get the full FDIC protection for each account.<br>  <br>  You need to move fast... if the FDIC closes the bank for restructuring and you still have the whole $400,000 in one account you could lose $300,000.<br>  <br>  P.S. The extended coverage of $250,000 expired on December 31, 20008.<br>  As of now we are back to the $100,000 insurance per account.|`|iU5chs5maa	All I can say is you must commit if you want to lose weight.

They are different.<br>  <br>  PS:  Having a garden tub in the master suite is NOT a "dead giveaway"...that is nonsense.  Homes in this area are constructed all the time with a garden tub in the master as an option and considered a desirable feature of the home.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	It's almost certainly a modular house.  If you check the listing on www.realtor.com, one of the advertised features is a 'master bath with a garden tub'.  That's a dead give away for a modular.

GiONso7zaa	depends on your credit rating and how much money you have in the bank. It depends on how much you're going to use as a down payment because those are going to determine your interest rate.<br>  <br>  It also depends on whether or not you have any outstanding debt.<br>  <br>  You also have to take into account your other expenses like car payments or insurance or gym memberships.

There is much competition in the restaurant business. You can sell an atmosphere, price, quality of product, variety of products, service. You can get them in the first time with gimmicks or promotion but unless they have a positive experience they may not come back. Word of mouth is your best advertising.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11834118	On your applications and interviews, specify that you can work weekdays before other kids get out of school.

Include any special awards or trophies you may have won. Add any "special interest" groups you participate in through school. Mention a few of your most transferrable skills (i.e. are you honest? Reliable? A quick learner?). List a handful of hobbies. <br>  <br>  Yes, by all means, get your resume into the manager's hands if at all possible. By doing so, you will have a chance to briefly meet him/her, ask a couple of questions about the advertised position and impress him/her with your enthusiasm. Also, don't just restrict yourself with applying for listed/advertised positions ... when you see a place where you would like to work, walk in and deliver a resume for a "suitable opening". <br>  <br>  Good luck with it ...

Sometimes the cutoff time is 2 PM, but that may depend upon time zones.<br>  <br>  Transfer between accounts at the same bank may happen quicker.  Or in some cases an account being transferred from or to for the first time might be longer.|`|pueeMH6gaa	It does depend.  If it is a transfer from your account to the IRS, that happens instantaneously.  Other transfers are much slower.

AQxZQv7paa	I've been working at Primerica for a little over 4 years now and its the most exciting opportunity I ever had in my life. Primerica is a business opportunity where you are allowed to recruit and build a business. Please note that you don't become a business owner until you reach the Regional Vice President (RVP) level. RVP can sell their business back to the company, or pass it to family member, or keep it and earn income for life.<br>  <br>  I'm not a RVP, but on my way to getting there. I'm a Division Leader in Primerica and I earn an average monthly income of $6000 during the past 12 months. If you want some advice, it is best to listen to your RVP. He or she can give you advice on what you need to do to get promoted to the next level. But here are some advice I can give to you if you want to get to my level:<br>  1) Find out why you are here.<br>  2) Setup yearly goals, then break it down to monthly, to weekly, and then to daily (your upline can help you with this)<br>  3) Have a written game plan or schedule.<br>  4) You must look at your game plan everyday.<br>  5) You must do your work and finish it.<br>  6) Always attend weekly training, even during times you don't want to go (unless its a complete emergency). Trainings are not mandatory to attend to, but I know that every successful person in Primerica never missed training.<br>  <br>  The worst advice you can take are people who are not involved in the company or quit in less than 2 years. Thats like checking out a college and getting advice from a college drop-out. They don't have all the information or a complete understanding of how this business works or how certain financial products work. Just look at the guy who said the SMART loan is all "smoke and mirrors." He doesn't have a single clue on how it works and he only been in the business for 6 months on a part-time basis.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you have specific questions, you should direct them to your RVP. Or you can check my profile and send a message to me.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	i almost did, but realized it was crap.  i got out of there before they made me pay for my own background check.  and based on what my job was going to be, it sounded like i was going to be a salesman

DuA8vkJHaa	Statistical tools are good but not infallible. What they do depends on the context.  The current best example of statistical analysis and its use was the Obama campaign. Where Joel Benenson, an obama pollster, used statistics to identify key issues that were important to american voters. In addition he managed to identify specific groups to target and those to leave alone. For example, statistics showed that Hillary clintons supporters would still vote democrat despite large fears that they would defect and vote republican. <br>  <br>  Politics aside, in a business statistics would help in a number of areas, problem solving and decision making through statistics, also Probability analysis, Transportation analysis. critical path analysis and Inventory. There are a number of applications depending on the usage, Say for example a Mc Donalds franchise could reach a decision on the number of cash registers its needs to open, Staff to employ, how many friers to keep, how many lines to open etc through statistics. It could also reach decisions on how long it wanted customers to wait in line to place an order! <br>  <br>  Finally Graphs are visual representations of stats, what type of graph is to be used depends again the situation. The most common graphs are blocks, pie charts and line graphs. Blocks are generally used to compare 2 or more variables, eg worker production per shift at a factory. Pie charts are used to show segments of a common factor. eg demographic data. And Line graphs are used to show change over time usally eg stock market data. <br>  <br>  Hope this is useful.|`|sC2t67Sraa	Yes that would be correct. These would be valuable to a business for example to show how production has done in the past year or so and how it could be doing better, lets say you had an idea to make production better, you could use graphs and charts etc to show how business was doing in the past and how it could be doing better if they presented your idea to the company. Again that is just an example. I am only trying to help.
7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	That's not true (previous answer).  There are some times when an ARM is a good choice.  Almost all my commercial real estate loans are ARMs.  <br>  <br>  For example, if you don't plan on staying there long, then no since in paying the extra rate to get a fixed 30 year.<br>  <br>  (that said, my own PERSONAL home that I don't plan to ever sell is a 30 year fixed...)|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The short amortization period increases the monthly payments a lot. The beginning adjustable interest rate lowers the payment a lot. So they cancel themselves out. Which means that they are a niche product which does not fit any buyer best. If you want low payments get a longer ARM.  If you want a short  term, get a 15 year loan..|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	An ARM loan fits someone that has a reasonable expectation of a significant pay increase prior to the reset of the rate.  Some people get into them because they predict that interest rates will be stable for x number of years.  <br>  <br>  An ARM also fits someone that knows they will only be staying in the home for a short period of time.  Sometimes due to family situations it's better/cheaper to go ahead and buy a house rather than rent.  <br>  <br>  There are reasons to chose an ARM over fixed rate.  The only problem with ARM loans is that some people get into them without fully understanding them.  People are too quick to blame the financial instrument rather than the consumers/mortgage companies abusing them.|`|tjLbXhtEaa	none, if you can't afford a fixed rate mortgage you shouldn't be buying a house, That is partly what got us into this mess.

I started one in late 2008 when I got laid off and I couldn't be happier with it. There's a link on my profile to the company that gave me the information I used to get started for free.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|XemJ5tFfaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.

614e7536de4e88e30f1c294b767a4d00aa	Each state is different.  In the state I work in, you must prove that you are less than 50% at fault.  If you are able to do so, based on 5k in meds and a fx ankle, you can probably recover somewhere in the 10-15k range.  However, there are a lot of variables.  How often did you go there?  Did you know it was icy, or should you have known?  What kind of shoes were you wearing, were you intoxicated?  Why did you loose work for 8 weeks for a broken ankle?  Is there any long term disability or limitation ?  Did you have any witnesses?  Are there signs warning of slope and/or ice?  <br>  <br>  your best bet is to go to the law library in your area, and research jury verdicts.  Then you will have a better idea of what you can recover, if anything.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	You never said where you were when the accident happened. What was the slope used for? Have you been there before and used this slope before? Was their alternatives to using the slope (like stairs)? Unless you fell in a hospital or an ambulance station or firehall no one is obligated to help you (unless the state/province where you live has Good Samaritan Laws). If no one is obligated to help you then there is no negligence in that respect (no duty owed to you). so trying to sue from this aspect will fail. As for how much you will get, being injured is not like winning the lottery. Ed McMahon doesn't show up with a giant cheque at your door saying you've just won 'x' because you fell. There are way too many factors to take into account, most of which haven't been identified in your post. Speak to your lawyer about this, since this is what they are getting paid for.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Fees to "runner" papers between offices are often unnecessary. Offer to drive all loan papers yourself and save the $25 per trip.<br>  There are estimates on the first HUD 1 which should not have shown up on the final HUD 1, so you have to go over every entry and ask for a receipt. They will gladly do this for you as part of their job.<br>  The biggest mistake is leaving something off which was mentioned in the contract. Or putting one of the seller's costs into your column. Easily remedied by asking for an explanation of every entry (some entries are easy- one year fire insurance does not need an explanation)..

ycwpFNWFaa	Health medical insurance should be your first consideration. (recommended)   <br>  <br>  Disability insurance will guarantee you some income should you suddenly become unable to work because of injury or illness. Having this extra peace of mind may be well worth the extra money you pay. (recommended)<br>  <br>  Business property insurance helps protect you against loss of inventory or equipment. If your business equipment or inventory is damaged in a flood, fire, or other disaster, this type of insurance will allow you to recoup your losses. You may be able to lump this with your Home owner insurance, but usually the Insurance company wants to keep home and business seperate . (recommended)<br>  <br>  Comprehensive general liability insurance is necessary for your home-based business if you plan on having clients or customers visit your home. Whether you plan to hold meetings, allow customers to pick up merchandise, or have members of the public enter your home for any other reason, this insurance will protect you if someone is injured while on your property. This insurance will typically pay for your legal defense should you face a lawsuit as the result of a fall or other damage that occurs on your property.<br>  <br>  Life insurance will help ensure that your family has the money it needs should you meet with an untimely death. Some lenders require that you have life insurance before they'll issue a loan; this guarantees that the loan will be repaid if you meet with an untimely end. <br>  <br>  Business interruption insurance will help your business recover from natural disasters. It will cover you for income lost during the disaster, and will pay for operating expenses that continue to accrue, even though your business isn't up and running. <br>  <br>  Workers' compensation insurance is vital if you plan on having employees working out of your home. Without workers' comp, you'll be responsible for any medical expenses arising from injuries employees sustain while working for you. Many home-based business owners mistakenly believe that this type of insurance is only required by businesses that have a retail or separate location, but that's not the case. (Read "What You Need to Know About Workers' Compensation Insurance." <a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/benefits-insurance-workers-compensation/819-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resourc...</a><br>  <br>  These insurance plans can help ensure that you are prepared to face any eventuality that might occur while you are running your own business. Disasters, accidents, and crises can strike at any time. By preparing now, you may be saving your company significant money over time.<br>  <br>  Good luck and all the best.

2ccf66984526063bdbf7c0a271981fcbaa	There's a lot of factors that goes into how much you should charge. <br>  <br>  Main questions adverrisers will ask are:<br>  1. How much traffic do you have?<br>  2. How many unique users per month?<br>  3. How many impressions / page views?<br>  4. Who goes to the site?<br>  5. What kind of ad opportunities do you offer?<br>  6. What ad sizes do you accept?<br>  7. What's compelling about your site that drives people to go there<br>  8. What kind of content/service do you offer?<br>  <br>  Depending on your answers, most web publishers charge on a CPM rate which means you pay a specific rate for every 1,000 ads/impressions served.  CPM rates vary depending on all the answers to the questions above (and there are more questions).<br>  <br>  Depending how big your site is, how popular, and how "niche" your content, advertisers pay anywhere from as low as $1 CPM to $50 CPM rates or higher.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a lot of impressions/page views, I suggest signing up for Google Ad Sense.  If you do, then you may want to be part of an ad network.

MbzyriZ4aa	The best way to increase your credit score is by using your credit cards in this manner:<br>  <br>  Only ever use 10% of your cards limit. Then either pay that off completely every month or stop using the card until you have the balance back to Zero before you charge again.<br>  <br>  Pay off your car loans and don't buy any more "new" cars.  PERIOD<br>  Your paid off car loans will show as a positive entry in your credit report and not having a car loan when you are ready to apply for a mortgage is the most favorable thing you can do... besides keeping your credit cards at the 10% limit each.<br>  <br>  Do not close your credit cards... (although the card you closed that only had a $100 credit limit was the right thing to do...).<br>  Keep all of your major credit cards and make sure that you never use more than 10% of their limits. The more available credit you have the bettter. You want to show a positive payment history and of course you also want to show that you really don't need to use Credit Cards to make a living... <br>  Use them... but only to increase your score. Don't use them for necessities and keep the balances at the 10% limit.<br>  If you follow my advise you will have a perfect credit score in 3 years.<br>  <br>  About the cars... once you have a car paid off start putting the car payment you no longer have and put it in a savings account. Do this for the next 10 months to a year. This way you have an emergency account that will easily pay for any major car repairs that might come up.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to apply for a mortgage you will not have a car loan and your credit cards are at their best. Barely used and no huge outstanding balances...

Landlords can sue a person and the suit would end up on the credit report if the landlord wins.  <br>  <br>  FILE?  Probably no impact.  If you get sued by the landlord, pay before the court date to avoid a judgment that will appear on the file.<br>  <br>  JUDGEMENTS-You didn't ask, but you should know that many landlords will pursue delinquent payments in court, especially if the tenant moves out early during a lease period.  A judgment will be on the credit report and greatly damage the file for up to 7 years.

qGfAlDd2aa	That all depends on why you want a card.  If you want a card to start a credit history, that's good.  If you want a card to purchase a lot of stuff, that's not so good.<br>  <br>  My daughter is about your age and just got her acceptance to Schreiner University in Texas.  She does incur some expenses (test fees, application fees, etc.).  A card is good for those type of expenses.<br>  <br>  The key here is, don't charge anything you can't pay off at the end of the month.  If you get into the habit of handling your credit this way, you will never get into credit trouble and you will not be paying interest.  Then the interest rate will not matter.<br>  <br>  I have never, ever had a problem with Discover's customer service.<br>  <br>  BTW, work at those scholorships!

The payer cannot call one person an employee and another a contractor if they do the same exact work.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	There is no 15% payroll tax in the USA|`|3vXc6gfnaa	Employers pay matching portions of Social Security (sometimes called FICA) and Medicare for each person classified as an employee.  The employee pays (through paycheck deductions) any Federal and State Income Tax.  Federal Income Tax is calculated based upon the information an employee provides on his W2:  Married/Single, Number of Dependents, etc.  Many states have their own version of the Federal W4 and calculate State Income Tax in a similar manner.  Some states (such as Arizona) have passed a flat tax rate law where employees pay a certain percentage.  When an employee is paid a bonus, the IRS (and many states as well) required a higher tax percentage to be paid on bonus wages (currently 23% for Federal, state guidelines vary).<br>  <br>  However, the bottom line is that companies only pay Unemployment Tax and portions of Social Security and Medicare.  The employees are the only ones who pay Federal and State Withholding/Income Tax.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	the employer has to pay 50% for all employees.<br>  the company does not pay anything for independent contractors.
W1tx1p2iaa	PT do the treatment aspect of PT.  They are an integral part of the therapy team.  Where I work (in the public schools) many people do not realize that the assistance only have a 2 year degree and often can not tell the PTA from the PT.  They do not see the supervision behind the scenes.  As the PT, I evaluate, set up the goals and the treatment plan.  The PTA does the treatment.  He or she then comes to me with the progress and we discuss the patient and then I modify the plan and the goals with the input of the PTA.  <br>  <br>  The salary  is dependendent on the area of the country that you work in and the area of practice you work in.  <br>  <br>  Your hours also depend on where you work.  Most work days.  If you work at a clinic that offers evening hours, you maybe scheduled to work 1-2 evenings a week (till 7 or 9).  If you work at a hospital you may need to rotate weekend days.  The PTAs that I work with at the public schools work 8-3:30, no weekends, or holidays and summers off (option to work for 6 weeks).<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the national PT organization--The APTA.  It gives you some idea on what a therapist does.

If you show intrest and work hard you wont have any trouble.

zEBOC8UPaa	Well I worked there and I did really well.  It was a hard job that definitely got me into shape!  When I started out my first year I didn't know what to expect, so it was a real wake up call, I got into shape and saved up my tuition.  The second year I was prepared and got in shape before the season and killed it.  I made around $19,000.00 my second year and just kept at it.  So to answer your question, yes it will be challenging but I for one am not afraid of challenges.  Can it be done? Yes.  Will it be easy for you?  Probably not.

So, I guess since we'd probably be doing active activities and they might be really labor demanding, for 12 hours... I dunno... I don't think it'd be good for you.

AQxZQv7paa	Primerica is made up of all people from around the world. From the far reaches of Asia to the nations of Europe to the southern tip of South America and Africa and to the friends up north in Canada. It does not matter if they are poor or middle class or wealthy class. Everybody is given the opportunity to build a business.<br>  <br>  But Primerica is made up mostly of middle class citizens such as myself. To me, they understand the financial needs of an average person than any other person.|`|pRibsCSXaa	Unsuspecting folks without any formal financial education.<br>  <br>  Primerica's business model is ingenious. They take folks with virtually no education and make them pass a rather easy life insurance exam and have them represent themselves as financial advisers. Those people get paid to sell insurance, mortgage, and investment products. Once the representatives realize they can't make any "real" money doing this, the focus becomes recruiting. Recruiting more uneducated people to do the same, "duplicating" as they call it.<br>  <br>  The reason they recruit is not to get paid directly for recruiting (which is what makes it a legal business model), but to make commission overrides from the people they've brought into the organization. Since the uplines make money when your downlines make money, recruiting is the main focus of the company.<br>  <br>  As a full-time financial services professional, you'll see "thumbs-down" ratings by Primerica reps within minutes of my post. You see, I've been in Primerica, and left within 6 successfult months. I was a district leader, back when it wasn't so easy to become one. I've forgotten more than Primerica reps will ever know. Since Primerica's main game is to recruit, the focus of "training meetings" is to teach you recruiting techniques. If you were a financial services professional, you'd probably want a little more training on the products you're going to sell, right? Not at Primerica.<br>  <br>  A true indicator as to the level of professionalism (or lack thereof) of Primerica, is to visit the National Association of Investment and Financial Advisors website ( www.naifa.org ) and try to find ONE, just ONE Primerica rep in this organization, anywhere in the country. I've yet to find one. It's organizations like these that teach about the ever-changing financial environment and how to improve your client's positions. Try to find a Primerica representative with an industry-recognized designation after their name, such as CFP, CLU, ChFC. Of course there are no Certified Financial Planners in Primerica, they'd be breaking the standards as soon as they recommended any products that Primerica sells. If you want to learn about what goes into these designations, go to www.theamericancollege.edu . The point I'm getting at is that virtually no one in Primerica pays for further education, but they'll show up week after week learning how to recruit and trash permanent policies.<br>  <br>  As further evidence that PFS' is a recruiting business, I'll tell you how you were recruited. Someone came up to you at work, maybe saw your resume on line, or used the referral trick..."Someone recommended you to me". The normal lines are "I'm in charge of expansion for a division of Citigroup and we're going to be opening a few more offices in the area and are looking for hard-working people like you." Sound familiar???? What happend when Citigroup (your only public-related source of "credibility" finally finds a dummy to buy Primerica, which has been for sale for a long time now?<br>  <br>  Ok, we've already covered how & why someone is recruited, the fact that Primerica reps get virtually no training from anywhere other than their upline (who we know aren't trained either). Next, let's get into the products...<br>  <br>  Sure, there are plenty of rotten apples in every bunch. There were some misleading life insurance salespeople years ago (and probably today). Primerica's normal practice is to show you some lapsed Variable Universal Life policies. I'm not going to confuse you too much, but the failure of these policies could be from the lack of competence from the agent that sold them, or the client who didn't follow through with the plan. What Primerica reps don't understand is that these policies do work (if funded properly) and have many benefits to them. They are not to be sold as an investment, and "true" professionals have their clients max out he matched portion of 401ks, IRA's, ROTH's etc, prior to recommending variable life products. However, since most of the new reps at Primerica don't know anything about variable products and are not even licensed to discuss them (another clue), all they see is failure of any permanent policy. Anyway, now the PFS salesperson is on an instant crusade against these products, as referenced ad nauseum by the guy with the cute ring avatar. As they progress and are one of the few that stay in the company, they realize (or at least should) that what they're saying over and over is the shtick they need to parrot, or they'd be without income. If they truly dug into the products they so happily say are "doing the right thing", they'd realize that:<br>  <br>  **The term insurance they peddle is upwards of 30-50% more than other competitive companies. Buy term and invest the difference...what difference? If the client took their business to someone competitive, their family would receive upon death, a benefit that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars more for the same premium Primerica was charging them Doing the

OOSwiE0Daa	I may be wrong here, but I assume that you are talking about sources saying that it is unconstitutional to pay income tax.  This comes from a part of federal law that says Americans have to pay taxes on money earned outside of the US.  Apparently various groups have said that this law is essentially saying you ONLY have to pay taxes if outside of the US as an American citizen.<br>  <br>  This argument has been used by hundreds of Americans when taken to court for not paying their income tax, and not one of them won.  It may seem unfair; it may seem out of line to have to pay so much, but you gotta do it.  And if you consider the fact that the the top five percent of income earners in America--the ones who use their money to create investments and jobs that help people like us out--pay 59.2% of all taxes, it doesn't seem nearly that bad for us.<br>  <br>  The good thing is, if you know someone who is good at doing your taxes, you could easily find various deductions (education, home, energy credits, etc.) that you might have missed that may give you a big refund on your taxes this April so you actually get money back.|`|AA11612672	You don't have to file if you aren't going to have a tax liability.

PDotv2Hsaa	A diploma or degree in Marketing or Mass Communication may help you get that initial interview, but beyond the first 1-2 jobs, ultimately it is the work experience that counts. This include the type of company and industry and the number of years of experience. <br>  <br>  To be successful at this job, you must be able to communicate well (among other things).  When I say well, I mean speaking and writing close to perfect grammar with a flair of creativity.<br>  <br>  Sometimes even an Arts degree might get you an interview if the interviewer is impressed with your cover letter and resume. However, if what you've studied is far from this, then go ahead and get that marketing cert. At least you get some basic knowledge in marketing. <br>  <br>  If you do not intend to take up the course, then at least find out what marketing is all about prior to applying for a marketing job. Nothing exasperates an interviewer more than a clueless person.

Most of the great fortunes have been built around sales in some form or another. Doctors make a high income. If you don't have a conscience you could become a lawyer. Most of them make a good living. Engineers do well for themselves. You can do well in just about anything you choose if you have the drive and ambition. It starts with a good education. Business owners can earn a lot of money or go broke. Success is less about what you do and more about how you do it. Drug dealers make a lot of money but you could wind up dead or in prison for doing it. On the other hand you could be a pharmaceutical sales rep and ma a good living and do so legally. There are various jobs in advertising and public relations that pay well. If you want to earn a lot of money then you need to find something that will base much of your income on how well you perform. That usually comes down to sales.|`|2kIoVqsUaa	depends on the specialization and where you are suited. Docs and Lawyers make lot money as it's complete public service.

i7oHTo9haa	There are two ways to market... go to them, or have them come to you.<br>  <br>  Going to them means running a campaign in their country. If I were to do that I would advertise in the countries that are the best fans of soccer and put an advertisement in their country.  When I think of soccer I think of the Brazilians. Is that my own stereotype of them or what, who knows? :)  They are a massive country and I would think they'd be able to make it to the last of the competition.So you decide who the best fans are and who's likely to make it to the last of the competition.  <br>  <br>  Normal avenue would be in their newspaper.  Internet has replaced many news sources so not sure how fruitful this would be to use newspaper.  To find an internet outlet (similar to craigslist US) in Brazil might be good. In America old school we have vacation rentals that are advertised from all over the world in our newspapers.  People more likely to read that would be older people.   Now internet is taking place of the newspapers.Younger generation now does internet. I would recommend internet than an actual physical newspaper because they are most likely to be soccer fans. So those are ideas on going to them. <br>  <br>  Worth noting is that we have a large Jewish presence in Brazil so maybe that is option on marketing to them. You know how to maneuver in Jewish realm, so I won't go into detail.<br>  <br>  With marketing, coming to you means to be available for them to find you in your home country. Joining a web site that offers vacation rentals, and showing availability for those particular dates. I do not recommend newspaper for this avenue.<br>  <br>  Doing both options of going to them and have them come to you would offer best chance of success but just seems overdone for vacation rental. I'd reserve that for other business adventures. For you I would just explore options such as branching out to the Brazilian Jewish community and being available for others to come to you and join a site in your home country and see how that works for you.  If it doesn't work well in a specific amount of time, then try branching out to them further.<br>  <br>  As far as the details I've rented before for snow skiing in Colorado. It was a home that slept 12-16 and came with transportation.  We were only required to tidy up and replace what food was consumed. We did it by the week.<br>  <br>  A sports match is much different than this and a month long sports match seems like it's a long vacation that most people cannot slip away for.  I would do option for week and show availability for the whole month to ensure best chance of renting out for duration. If you plan on doing one set of people in one week and another people another week you'll have to be nearby to make sure the place is tidied up from the previous tenants before the next ones arrive.<br>  <br>  There are alot of vacation rentals in the state of Florida too.  Here is a website that will show you how they offer them. The way it works is that there is a --- calendar --- and to book up according to availability. It just all goes by bookings and availability like a hotel.  Some holidays were more expensive, weekends more expensive than the average rates. So if there is grand finale at the end of that sports competition the pricing should reflect higher.<br>  <br>  Check out this site you must have one equivalent for your own country. Here's one for Florida<br>  <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/florida" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa...</a><br>  <br>  PS.  Oh and there is another way to do it and to house swap.  My aunt from Southern California did this and traveled all over the world by swapping houses for a certain period of time with others from around the world with people that wanted to come visit America.  I'm not sure how to do that though.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Look at craigslist.com if you want to advertise in the US.  It's free & used a lot.  Not as many soccer fans here but there are some.

b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Potentatengelder<br>  Die Schweiz war immer wieder Hort für Gelder von Diktatoren, von Mobutu über Marcos bis Abacha. Die AFP setzt sich für eine gerechte Rückführung dieser Gelder ein.<br>  Illegitime Schulden / Schuldenkrise<br>  Viele Drittweltl?nder leiden unter Schulden, die von Diktatoren oder korrupten Regierungen eingegangen worden sind. Die AFP ist der Meinung, dass solche illegitimen Schulden nicht auf dem Buckel der Bev?lkerung abgezahlt werden dürfen, sondern gestrichen werden müssen. Im übrigen sind die Schulden der Drittweltl?nder durch Zins und Zinseszins l?ngst mehrfach zurückbezahlt.<br>  Beispiel:<br>  Nigeria / Abacha<br>  Zwischen 1993 und 1997 haben der nigerianische Ex-Diktator Sani Abacha und seine Entourage vermutlich über 2 Mrd. US-Dollar aus dem Land schaffen lassen und auf westlichen Bankkonten platziert. Nach dessen Sturz und Tod liess das Schweizer Bundesamt für Justiz 1999 aufgrund eines nigerianischen Rechtshilfebegehrens Gelder auf Genfer Konten sperren, insgesamt 640 Mio. US-Dollar. Bereits 2000 und 2002 wandte sich eine NGO-Koalition, unter anderm mit der Aktion Finanzplatz Schweiz und der Erkl?rung von Bern, an die Bundesbeh?rden mit der Forderung, sich für eine demokratische Rückführung der Gelder einzusetzen. Ende 2003 wurden 85 Mio. US-Dollar (110 Mio. Franken) freigegeben, weil sie nicht im Zusammenhang mit dem von Nigeria angestrebten Rückgabeverfahren stünden. Im Januar 2004 wandte sich deshalb die Nigeria-Koalition von Schweizer NGO’s, bestehend aus AFP, Erkl?rung von Bern, Institut für ?kologie und Aktionsethnologie Schweiz (infoe CH), Gesellschaft für bedrohte V?lker, Greenpeace Schweiz und Transparency International Schweiz mit einem offenen Brief an das Bundesamt für Justiz und forderte, die weiterhin gesperrten Gelder zugunsten sozialer Projekte und für die Entsch?digung von Opfern von Menschenrechtsverletzungen einzusetzen. Im April 2004 wurden 50 Mio. US-Dollar (70 Mio. Franken) aufgrund einer Vereinbarung zwischen dem Kontoinhaber und der nigerianischen Regierung an Nigeria zurückerstattet. Weiterhin blockiert blieben 458 Mio. US-Dollar (640 Mio. Franken). Seit Juni 2004 stand die Nigeria-Koalition, die eng mit NGO’s aus Nigeria zusammenarbeitet, in Verhandlungen mit den Beh?rden, um die Verwendung der Gelder im Interesse der nigerianischen Bev?lkerung zu garantieren. Die Rückführung wurde im Februar 2005 vom Bundesgericht für rechtskr?ftig erkl?rt. Allerdings hatte die nigerianische Regierung die Gelder bereits für bestimmte Projekte vorgesehen oder sogar schon ausgegeben. NGO-Koalition und Schweizer Bundesbeh?rden erreichten immerhin, dass Nigeria im September 2005 einem Monitoring zustimmte, das unter Aufsicht der Weltbank durchgeführt wird. Die Zivilgesellschaft machte dazu Vorschl?ge und wurde mit Experten einbezogen; die erste Phase des Monitoring im Mai 2006 offenbart schwerwiegende M?ngel bei dem von der nigerianischen Regierung verantworteten Einsatz der Gelder.|`|f928026d6aa9020e76c7765ce696d47daa	Hallo Miss,<br>  <br>  ein "Potentat" ist ein Machthaber oder Herrscher.<br>  Dem entsprechend sind Potentatengelder die Verm?gen dieser Herren.|`|314a709cb65619493d1273d6ac1c5787aa	Potentate kommt vom lateinischen Wort potens für m?chtig und wird für Personen benutzt, die Machtinhaber sind.

Anything in excess of 7 years from the date of default or last payment must be removed from your report. <br>  The debts that are questionable, get debt validation done on it.

I was in a similar situation as you so I know the hill you are about ready to climb ;-).<br>  <br>  Start by calling the people you owe debts to and explain the situation. Tell them you would like start setting up payments with the goal of repairing your credit. They typically will ask for an up front payment to show good faith but you might end up having some of the interest rates lowered (those kill you btw) and payments that are more manageable. Don't expect a lot of leeway at first... show them you can make payments on time for 6 months and call them back and try to negotiate another deal.<br>  <br>  If you have open credit cards... stop using them but DO NOT CLOSE THE ACCOUNTS. Part of your credit score is based on the amount of credit line you have and the percentage of that credit which is used. If you have a total of $10,000 credit but only use $3000 of it, it will increase your credit score.<br>  <br>  Also check out FreeCreditReport.com and monitor your credit score.

You must take into account that the creditors may just be looking at a liquidation process, however if there is an additional plan that you have this must be brought to the table.  Leave nothing out and bring everything.  The creditors at this time are looking to get their money back, you borrowed it so you need to have a plan to live up to your end of the deal (repayment).

Foi o tempo em que a maioria dos títulos de dívida realmente ofereciam uma “renda fixa” no mercado brasileiro.<br>  <br>  Atualmente, o rendimento da maioria dos títulos é determinado somente no seu vencimento ou no aniversário de pagamento do rendimento, quando é calculado o juro segundo uma fórmula pré-estipulada, que pode envolver índices de infla??o, a varia??o do dólar ou, na maior parte dos casos, o valor acumulado de uma taxa de juros, como as taxas DI ou SELIC.<br>  <br>  A maior parte dos fundos brasileiros investe somente em ativos de renda fixa, que constituem mais de 90% do patrim?nio agregado dos fundos de investimento. Os fundos referenciados ao DI s?o o tipo mais popular de fundo de renda fixa.<br>  <br>  Os fundos DI s?o oferecidos por grande parte dos administradores de investimento, particularmente por aqueles ligados aos grandes bancos. Pode-se dizer, sem exagero, que o fundo DI é a espinha dorsal da indústria de fundos brasileira. Ainda assim, há alguns mal entendidos a respeito deles.<br>  <br>  Por exemplo, os investidores muitas vezes n?o sabem que as taxas de administra??o cobradas pelos fundos variam muito entre institui??es e, principalmente, na mesma institui??o. Os investidores podem, também, n?o notar que os fundos DI s?o muito parecidos entre si. Os fundos investem, predominantemente, em títulos do Tesouro Nacional que oferecem taxas pós-fixadas, atreladas à taxa SELIC, em títulos privados pós-fixados, como os CDB emitidos pelos bancos, com remunera??o atrelada à taxa do CDI.<br>  <br>  A taxa de administra??o difere entre fundos de uma mesma institui??o em fun??o do tipo de público a que se destina o fundo. Por exemplo, fundos DI com investimento mínimo elevado cobram taxas de administra??o mais baixas do que fundos DI que permitem investimento mínimo baixo, como é o caso dos fundos DI disponíveis para os clientes de varejo bancário, particularmente para pequenos poupadores. Entretanto, a taxa de administra??o faz muita diferen?a no longo prazo. Elas podem variar de menos de 0,5% ao ano até mais do que 4% ao ano para fundos DI. <br>  <br>  Na realidade, n?o há vários fundos DI em uma mesma institui??o. De fato, os fundos comercializados investem em quotas de um grande fundo DI administrado pela institui??o. Todos os investidores est?o no mesmo avi?o, tanto os que pagam menos de 0,5%, quanto os que pagam mais de 4%. Só que cada um pagou um valor diferente pela viagem. Portanto, você deve estar sempre atento à oportunidade de trocar de fundo, passando a pagar uma taxa de administra??o mais baixa.<br>  <br>  A conta investimento facilitou esta troca. Se você investe em fundos DI, veja seu saldo e converse com a sua institui??o financeira. Pode haver a possibilidade de pagar uma taxa de administra??o menor sem que você seja penalizado por esta troca. Se você pensa em investir em fundos DI, examine as taxas de administra??o cobradas e o investimento mínimo dos fundos que lhe interessam. Sempre é possível juntar dinheiro temporariamente em um fundo que cobra taxas mais altas visando passar para o de taxa mais baixa assim que possível. Finalmente, em geral é verdade que as taxas cobradas por administradores de investimento ligados a grandes bancos sejam mais elevadas que as taxas cobradas por administradores independentes. Portanto, pesquise.|`|6f0c04d922af4b193858a8d329966832aa	Os fundos DI, s?o papéis indexados ao CDI (certificado de depósito interbancário), onde a rentabilidade está atrelada a varia??o deste indexador.<br>  Resumidamente é isto, se falar mais complica.<br>  OK?

cu8fUJbMaa	I think what you really have to be honest with  yourself about is whether you have the drive and initiative to be a business owner. You have to be the kind of person who is willing to work long hours for little pay--at least initially, and to dedicate yourself to doing what's best for your business rather than what's easiest. It certainly has it's pluses, but owning your own business is not as glamorous as it looks like from the outside.  In today's economy, I would be very careful about leaving a steady job to begin my own business. It's not the best time!

Z44Zj1Vbaa	Tax refunds continue to be delayed<br>  <br>  The State Controller announced on Thursday, February 19, 2009, that once the budget plan provides the needed cash in the treasury, his office will work around the clock to get delayed payments out the door. Check this website for updated information on the status of the delayed tax refunds.<br>  <br>  Frequently Asked Questions<br>  Should I wait to file my return?<br>  No. If you have all of the documents and information needed to prepare your return, you may file it any time through April 15 (or October 15, if filed on extension). The refund delay does not affect the return due date or our ability to process returns.<br>  <br>  When will the refund delay be lifted? (Updated February 20, 2009) <br>  It is anticipated that as soon as the cash problems are solved, the refund delay will be lifted. Check this website for updated information on the status of the delay.<br>  <br>  Now that the budget is passed, when will my refund be issued? (Updated February 20, 2009) <br>  Even though the budget is enacted, the state must now determine if there is sufficient cash to pay outstanding debts, including tax refunds.  Until then, refunds will continue to be delayed.<br>  <br>  Will you still honor my direct deposit request (DDR) when the delay is lifted?<br>  Yes, your DDR will be honored when the state resumes the payment of refunds.<br>  <br>  Is it possible that I will be issued an IOU?<br>  If the state’s cash flow problems do not improve, the Controller may need to issue IOUs. If the Controller has to issue IOUs, you will receive a paper IOU warrant, even if you requested a direct deposit of your refund.<br>  <br>  Are all refunds delayed or just 2008 tax year refunds? (Updated February 20, 2009) <br>  All refunds are delayed, regardless of the tax year they apply to. For example, an approved refund claim for tax year 2006 will be delayed until the state’s cash problems are solved.<br>  <br>  Am I entitled to receive interest because of the delay? <br>  It depends upon the length of the delay. For individual taxpayers, interest on current year refunds is only paid if your refund is not issued within 45 days after April 15, or the date that your return is filed, whichever is later. If you are entitled to receive interest on a prior year refund, you will receive it when your refund is issued.<br>  <br>  Can I apply my refund as an estimated payment toward my 2009 taxes?<br>  Yes, if on your 2008 return you request that your refund be applied toward your 2009 taxes, we will apply the amount you designate when we process your return.<br>  <br>  If I owe for other debts collected by FTB, will my refund be applied toward that debt?<br>  Yes. You will be refunded the difference, if any, once the delay on issuing refunds is lifted.<br>  <br>  www.ftb.ca.gov/online/refund/index.asp|`|1DeMh7yFaa	I have already received mine so yours should be on the way.|`|CsRMZ21Vaa	i thought they werent going to do that anymore|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	When Hittler is making snowmen in HELL|`|bCkw8E8faa	never... go democrats

The librarian will ask the following questions in order to qualify you as a "certified" typist:<br>  <br>  (1) Are you familiar and have a working knowledge of Microsoft Word?<br>  <br>  (2) Are you able to set up section breaks along with appropriate placement of auto page numbering in the footer/header?<br>  <br>  (3) Are you familiar with setting up a scheme with emphasis on the proper use of auto numbering, such as 1., 1.1, (a), (i), etc.?<br>  <br>  (4) Do you have access to a scanner with built-in OCR sofware?<br>  <br>  (5) Do you have access to a high-speed laser quality printer?<br>  <br>  If you answer all the above questions in the affirmative, the librarian will provide you with a sample of the typing format template (i.e., margin settings, font selection, page set up, etc.) in order to complete these projects. <br>  <br>  The librarian will then place your name on a list of "certified" graduate typists. This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.<br>  <br>  An average weekend income is about $300-$400 for two days of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	Primarily because of the way it evolved. While virtually every other nation's central bank was nationalized in the 20th century, the Federal Reserve maintains a public/private partnership with member banks.<br>  <br>  To understand why, one must go back to when the Federal Reserve act was being debated. At the time, there was considerable debate on how the central bank should be organized. The Federal Reserve Act that was passed was a compromise of those that wanted a 100% private central bank (Republicans), and those that wanted a 100% government central bank (Democrats). (An early version that called for 100% private was defeated).<br>  <br>  The bill that passed called for private bank dominated branches overseen by a government agency (then called the Board of Directors).<br>  <br>  However that arrangement proved unworkable. The branches had too much autonomy and did not act in a coordinated manner which severely hampered the governments ability to deal with the Great Depression. That changed with the Bank Act of 1935 which have complete control over monetary policy to the newly renamed Board of Governors. The branches were relegated to day-to-day operations.<br>  <br>  But some say this 'private' portion is more of a sham.<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, noted anti-fed intellect (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Because it's owned by the member banks (e.g., bank of america, jp morgan chase, etc.), but the profits of the Federal Reserve are deposited into the US Treasury.|`|OFGE01tRaa	for several years the entire board of directors of the Fed were zionists. mostly during greenspan's tenure. the rothschild connection is obvious, the whole global matrix is obvious. <br>  <br>  they play a shell game with ordinary people. they are illuminae, the enlightened money lenders that can be traced back for many centuries.<br>  <br>  just connect the dots and follow the money. london, paris, nyc, amsterdam, zurich, tel aviv, hong kong, mexico city, sydney,  etc. etc.<br>  <br>  until you understand the matrix, you don't have a clue about how this world functions.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	Because they are an illegal and unconstitutional corporation that counterfeit money everyday so that we can live beyond our means until the dollar collapses.

He speaks of well researched and unfortunate truths, that are also well hidden. But now, with the help of the internet we can spread these truths... until they regulate the internet like they are trying to do. Then we will be blinded once again. Protect the internet.
TLcON6Inaa	I highly doubt that was the issue. <br>  <br>  Here is what most likely happened. When they prepared your taxes they messed up on the stimulus question and did not report you received your $1200 therefore they inflated your refund amount by $1200 to recover what you were due from 2008 as if you did not receive any stimulus money. Therefore the IRS caught that you had already received it and took it back out. My guess is your refund was also delayed a week or two because of the mistake. <br>  <br>  They did not scam you if this is this case you DID receive your correct refund, they just messed up and had it overstated by $1200.<br>  <br>  I would call them and ask them if that is indeed what happened!|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	You must have told the place you filed that you did not receive a stimulus check last year.  Those who did not receive it last year had their tax liability reduced by that amount this year.<br>  <br>  When the IRS got your tax return, the found out that you DID get a stimulus check last year and so they reduced your "overstated" refund amount because you can't claim the stimulus twice.<br>  <br>  That is the ONLY way that could have happened.  You don't have to pay back the stimulus check because it was a credit toward the tax amount you would owe this year.|`|AA11132354	NO, you don't pay back the Stimulus Rebate.  In fact, if you didn't get the full amount last year, you can get the rest this year.  Although some refunds have been separated into two payments, with either EIC or Rebate Recovery arriving about a week later.  Presumably you and the preparer accurately reported the amount of the Stimulus Rebate you received last year?<br>  This preparer sounds shady or you are confused..|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Was their fee based on you refund?  In any case I would not use them again if they did not ask you the right questions or explain the stimulus accounting to you.

XAesYVU9aa	First, please check to see if the shares are "canceled". That is, there is some marking (likely imprinted through the paper or stamped on the paper) that indicate the shares are no longer valid. If the shares have not been canceled, the rest of this post is valid. If they are canceled, collectors may be interested in the shares. (The collecting of canceled shares is called "scripophily".<br>  <br>  Brokerages (and some accountants) subscribe to services that allow them to see what happened to old shares of stock. The company may have been taken over by another and new stock was issued. It may be defunct. It may have been purchased for cash, etc.<br>  <br>  My recollection is that they use CCH corporate actions database but a quick look on the internet shows that it only goes back to 1928. Perhaps your broker has access to a service that goes back further.|`|QT6iRQNaaa	If the company doesn't exist, the stock is not worth anything in the stock market.<br>  <br>  However, it might have collectibility value depending on the company and the nature of the stock. <br>  <br>  One way to find out is to check the RarityGuide Price Check Forum.

But if that company does still exist and is doing well, then you may be looking at a lucrative sum of money coming your way. Just with the difference in dollar value from 1920 to now is great! But, if company has grown then who knows how much it's worth now!

ZFo3XOURaa	Ok, there are four things you need right now to assure you can get a loan. First anyone who's income and credit are being used to get the loan will have to have been in the same line of work for at least two years. Second you need to have a two year track record of paying your bills on time. Despite what alot of people say, thanks to FHA, your credit score is not extremly important when it comes to getting a loan,but the better your credit score the better the interest rate you will recieve. Next your ratios will have to be good. This means the percentage of your gross income that goes out to pay debts will have to be at or below 38% for conventional and 41% for FHA. Those percentages include the house payment It looks as though you will probably be able to meet the debt ratio requirements. Next thing you will need to have a down payment of at least 3.5% and 20K covers that point. Assuming that both you and your boy friend have paid all your bills on time for the last two years you should be able to get a loan on a condo that can garner FHA approval. <br>  <br>  Another poster stated that you should not enter into a contract on a home without being married that is b.s. There are ways to hold title that assure that you will have no problem assuring whoever is coming up with the down payment gets their appropriate share of the money from a sale. I am not allowed to advise you on how to hold title because that would be considered practicing law, but I can tell you that for less than 350 bucks you can sit down with a lawyer and he/she can tell you how you should hold title to prevent any problems if you and your boy friend split up.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	Yes, but here is the thing:<br>  <br>  Engaged is not legally married. The law has no legal provisions for "almost marrieds".<br>  <br>  If you purchase the house without the benefit and legal protections of marriage, you'll essentially give away 50% of that $20K down.<br>  <br>  So, if the relationship doesn't work out, the law treats it as a business arrangement...marriage has special protections.<br>  <br>  Never sign 30-year contracts with someone that you don't have a LIFETIME contract with....in writing!|`|r9nxFkGtaa	It sounds like you shouldn't have a problem being approved, assuming that you both have a good credit score.
ATlZiDw9aa	No, you do not get $8000.  It is a $8000 tax deduction and applies to your joint tax return.  If filling separately, then only one person gets the credit.<br>  The tax credit is equal to 10 percent of the home’s purchase price up to a maximum of $8,000. <br>  The credit is available for homes purchased on or after January 1, 2009 and before December 1, 2009. <br>  Single taxpayers with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples with incomes up to $150,000 qualify for the full tax credit. <br>  ...

The fact that it revolves around a game doesn't appeal to me, but many people really enjoy it and it does provide benefits to those who participate.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.*************/index.php?ref=69427" rel="nofollow">http://www.*************/index.php?ref=6...</a><br>  <br>  Minimum Payout: $20.00<br>  Referral Bonuses: Two Tiers - 20%, 10%<br>  Payment: Every month - by Check, Visa Gift Card.<br>  Get Paid To: Complete offers and join free clubs and websites.<br>  <br>  "Companies need consumers to try and review products, services, and websites and are willing to pay you to do it...What we do is take the money companies give us for your participation and give back up to 75% of it!"<br>  <br>  Cash Crate gives nice bonuses and you can get paid very well over the long term with their generous referral program - 20% for direct referrals, 10% for second tier.<br>  <br>  They don't have quite as many offers as Treasure Trooper or Instant Profitz but their site is very navigable and they are very organized with their information. Cash Crate clearly states what you can earn from each offer. They take care of your pending offers for you and send you confirmation e-mails when offers go through, as well as when they didn't so you can re-try.<br>  <br>  Instant Profitz: <a href="http://www.instantprofitz.com/?ref=sanpedro" rel="nofollow">http://www.instantprofitz.com/?ref=sanpe...</a><br>  <br>  Minimum Payout: $20.00<br>  Referral Bonuses: Two Tiers - 10-20%, 3-5%<br>  Payment:Every month - Paypal!, Check, Other.<br>  Get Paid To: Complete offers, play games, shop.<br>  <br>  Instant Profitz really does put more instant money in your pockets. A great $3.00 sign-up bonus is an easy plus. Along with their standard referral system, you also receive a $0.25 bonus for each new referral you get.<br>  <br>  Instant Profitz offers higher than normal payouts with the option of Paypal, but the referral program is different compared to others. Referral % earnings are only credited when and IF your referral reaches a $20 minimum and cashes out. Some of your future referrals will do offers but never make it to the $20 cash out minimum, costing you lost referral earnings. Other programs like Cash Crate and Treasure Trooper will credit your percentage instantly and they also offer higher referral % earnings.<br>  <br>  Once you're earning a few bucks email me and we can discuss other ways with minimum investment.<br>  <br>  As always any questions please ask.<br>  <br>  Mark|`|b98aea6d5556c5dd713a6f6bb046c322aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  The best way to make money on the Internet is by doing Affiliate marketing for other successful Internet Businesses.

Essa explica??o n?o está correta.<br>  <br>  Contabilidade é ciência, é arte e é o registro dos atos e fatos administrativos.<br>  <br>  A contabilidade como ciência estrutura-se através de metodologia própria e das normas técnicas reguladas por lei. <br>  <br>  Os demonstrativos contábeis, contam a história completa sintetica e analiticamente  de todas as opera??es realizadas e seus registros s?o efetuados através de sistemas, podendo ser por processamento eletronico  de dados, e também em livros. Esses registros s?o chamados de lan?amentos contábeis, cujas opera??es s?o registradas a debito ou a credito de contas que representam direitos e obriga??es. <br>  Vamos simplificar para facilitar o entendimento:<br>  Existe uma conta chamada "Caixa" quando é registrado um valor no débito, significa que recebeu um valor de alguém, portanto, éla tem a guarda desse valor, e esse valor éla deve para alguém.   Quando é registrado um valor no crédito, significa que pagou alguém, ou registra a saida de dinheiro que foi depositado em um banco, e o banco passa a ser devedor desse valor para "caixa". <br>  Esse valor que saiu da conta caixa cujo registro foi efetuado no crédito, tem a contrapartida que é o Banco que recebe o dinheiro e ent?o é registrado a débito da conta Banco, significando que o banco deve para a conta caixa.<br>  Essas contas, caixa, banco, imobilizado, etc. s?o chamadas de contas dos proprietários, cujos saldos devedores signifcam que devem para os sócios ou acionistas o que eles investiram para formar o capital, A conta de capital tem registrada em seu crédito todos os valores que representam o dinheiro colocado. Portanto, consta que os socios ou acionistas tem crédito desse valor.<br>  Há também as contas dos agentes consignatários, que a credito s?o resgistradas todas as obriga??es contraídas.<br>  por exemplo: Contas a pagar - Eletropaulo ou  Impostos a pagar - Secretaria da Fazenda. significam que os valores registrados a crédito, e cujo saldo credor - diz que a Eletropaulo tem o credito do valor x , porque ela vendeu energia elétrica. E o custo dessa energia elétrica - é registrado a débito da conta  de Despesas de Energia Eletrica. <br>  Bém, é um pouco complexo tudo isso, espero que essas explica??es sirvam como um início de um pequeno  entendimento. <br>  O ideal seria fazer o curso de ciências contábeis e sucésso para você.|`|6a1984e57678d5092676b186dc89395eaa	- Amigo !!!<br>  <br>     Em contabilidade, significam -:<br>  <br>      D........débito.........devedor.<br>      C........Crédito......credor.<br>  <br>     No seu livro de contabilidade, se estiver o saldo com D ao<br>     lado do valor significado saldo devedor, e, se for com C ao<br>     lado do valor significa saldo credor.<br>  <br>     Estes livros, já vem com a impress?o D/C, para que quem<br>     fizer a apura??o do saldo, simplesmente coloque D ou C<br>     ao lado, informando tratar-se de saldo credor ou devedor.<br>  <br>     Sucesso, sorte Sempre !!!<br>  <br>      Jose André.|`|d4d076223317ae3a0585df294d436d62aa	Débito e crédito.<br>  A compreens?o sobre débito e crédito s?o diferentes dos usados no nosso cotidiano.<br>  Existem contas, como conta Caixa q representa os valores em moeda e existe a conta Bancos q representa as contas bancárias da empresa.

Assim é que as tarifas astron?micas, a falta de critério mais rigoroso para fornecimento de talonários de cheques, a facilita??o na concess?o de financiamentos, tudo isto aliado a uma política de arrocho salarial de seus funcionários, inclusive com desobediência a leis trabalhistas, leva o Bradesco a um alto índice de lucratividade e daí o crescimento acima da média dos outros bancos.|`|2b9335e00b52a53edde5177cef51c824aa	Além de juros e tarifas,o Bradesco tem muitos privilégios,por exemplo funciona nos correios,empresta dinheiro com desconto em folhas para aposentados e etc etc etc,vai ver o Banco é um dos donos do pais,que a afinal é o oitavo mais rico do mundo,embora os trabalhadores nunca vejam a cor desse dinheiro...|`|ZpiychKpaa	Eles também se associaram aos Correios, e criaram o banco postal.<br>  <br>  Creio que o crescimento se deve a explora??o de seus funcionários.|`|9De2iRjKaa	Poucas palavras:<br>  <br>  MERCADO ENORME (150 MILH?ES POSSíVEIS CLIENTES) E MAIS, EM EXPANS?O.<br>  <br>  POUCOS COMPETIDORES (N?O MAIS QUE 10 BANCOS).<br>  <br>  SPREAD (DIFEREN?A ENTRE CUSTO PARA RECEBER DINHEIRO - E APLICAR DINHEIRO) BRASILEIRO COMO NO CONTO DE FADA "O PARAíSO DOS BANCOS".

It is at least 7.75, but some states may be higher.<br>  <br>  McDonalds pays 10-12 an hour in my area, others may be more or less.<br>  <br>  Safeway is a union, they probuly start around the same rate.<br>  <br>  I don't know what Superstore is.<br>  <br>  Safeway would require you to be 18, because a minor can't sign the union contract.<br>  <br>  McDonalds hires kids though, you have to be 16.|`|989b880d0cf1e9075c80d658afbe9d87aa	Safeway is union and the starting rate in California for Safeway is 7.55 an hour.  It is NOT the same as minimum wage.  However, the other jobs you listed are minimum wage paying jobs that you will most likely not ever get raises in.  By working for Safeway and being in the union, you get a pay raise at every 1044 (6 months) you work.  As far as hours go at Safeway, it depends on the store's sales of course.  If a store does high sales, they can give more hours.  If they do crappy, they give minimal hours. <br>  <br>  You have to be at least 16 to work at Safeway.  The info you got about having to be 18 is wrong.
