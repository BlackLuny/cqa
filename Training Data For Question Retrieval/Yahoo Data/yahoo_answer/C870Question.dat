20090219171843AAJUBe2	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Why is my major so important to these employers?	I majored in marketing, and admittedly I did it because I was a bit lazy in college.  It's been like 8 months and I can't get a job for the life of me.  I have no idea where to even look anymore.      Now I have some friends that have zero experience and have recently graduated about a month ago.  They majored in accounting.  They both now have jobs making almost 40K.  Well it turns out they are doing data entry and there is nothing to do with accounting, yet I can't get these jobs because my degree is marketing.  I don't get that.  My other friend is paid close to 50K for his computer science degree and he essentially types code that is provided for him into a computer.      A child can do these jobs.  They have told me that they have never used a thing they learned in school.  So why the hell can't I get a job like this?  Just because my 60K piece of paper says I can only sell vacuum cleaners?      Just my rant.  College majors are highly overrated.  I can be trained to do virtually any job and pick it up just as quickly as someone that majored in the industry.  I don't know many people that remember much undergrad work anyway.  What a flawed ridiculous system.      Anyone else find this to be Horse-S-H-I-T?

Hi everyone,      I`m planning on moving to New York probably by the end of the year.I know it`s early but I want to make sure my decision is the right one. Can someone tell me, where would be the best, safest and cheapest area to live at? I know that won`t be an easy combination in New York, but I am trying:) It also should be close to public transportation and not too far from Manhattan (max 30 to 45min.), because that`s where I will be working at. I heard Brooklyn or Queens would be good choices but where exactly?   Can someone also tell me, what I should be aware of when I rent there? It will be my 1st apartment and I`m not sure how that works with credit checks or what could I expect to be included by renting.      I appreciate all your help suggestions.I feel like a dummy, but I live with my dad right, so there is nothing to worry about:)      Thanks again

I believe the house is paid off, but I'm not sure.      So, I was pretty excited, and I began planning to rent it and sell it in the future, soon after I obtained my deed for a transfer of property ownership, until....      I found out that my relative was deeply in debt!  What happened was that she fell for a lot of "Get Rich Quick!!" schemes, and I believe the debt is credit card debt.      I'm not co-signed to anything of hers, so I know I'm not going to inherit the debt, but if I claim the house, will her debt be my responsibility as well?  If the house becomes my property, is there still a risk of her house being liquidated to cover her debt?  Is there any way I can prevent this from happening, as I don't believe creditors have taken her house (yet)?

20090203110940AAVR72C	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Can a refund be made to a different debit card on your name?	Hi, I took out Bell Car Insurance and i cancelled my policy within 7 days cooling off period.  I was advised that i was due a refund of ￡26.  I was told that this would be refunded to the same debit/credit card that i made the deposit from.  This is were the problem is you see.  i no longer use my rbs debit card because i have an ongoing complaint with them over bank charges.  My account is sitting at nearly ￡300 overdrawn due to these bank charges.  My wages currently get paid to a new bank account.  If they refund the money to that account then i will not see the refund as it would be swallowed up by my charges.  I asked them to refund another debit card on my name, registered at the same address or to send me a cheque for the amount.  They have told me that they cant do this.  i find it slightly hard to believe.  I know that would be the normal procedure which i can understand but i have made it clear for them not to do this as i would lose it.  I told them not to bother refunding me if that was the case and that i would contact the FSA for further advice.  As far as i was aware; if you pay by cash you get refunded by cash, if you pay by debit card you get refunded by debit card (regardless of the debit card as long as it is in your own name).  That way they are still refunding in the same method as you paid for it.

I lost a lot in the stock market- about half a million and now I don't know where to invest what is left.  The era of having my money work for me is over.  I am planning to start my own business and thus, help the economy by creating jobs.  This way, I have control over my money and if I lose it, it is because I am to blame.  I am so angry that I trusted my husband's advice on investing in the global stock market.  I told him early last year to move  investments in gold but will not listen...dang it.  Will you ever put your money back in the stock market?  Thoughts? Anyone?

If I have a 2 year old VACANT townhome, that has neighbors living left and right who uses central heaters at nite(no one above and below, each townhome sits on its own spot as a single unit, but there’s common walls attached to one another). Now if I want to make sure that the pipes don’t freeze due to the snowy winter where I live, what temperature do I need to set it at 24 by 7, but not waste too much gas? Is anything above 32 F ok? Also, if I leave the heater on always, do I need to go in to turn on the hot water once in a while to prevent the pipes from freezing?      2. would you know which month can I stop worrying about the pipes being freezed and no need to turn on the heater? march or the end of Feb? under the condition that the state that I live snows in Jan. and sometimes in Feb.      3. If I set the temp to be 48F, and if the place is hotter than 48F, say it’s 50F, will the heater work hard to bring the temp DOWN to 48F? or the system will just pause to save gas and electricity which my central heater uses? thank you.

I had heart surgery in August and lost my dad in June and haven't really been back to my normal self till recently. Anyways since I wasn't working and had nothing to do I thought I'd go back to school ( I'm 17 && due to family matter's dropped out) but three days later I got offered a full time job. Now I'm completely stressed out and I've only worked two days and I already know I need to drop either work or school.   Here's my dilemma, I live with my boyfriends family and they support me, because my mom can't. So his parent's literally pay for everything and I feel so bad and want to be able to support myself. But on the other hand I really need to finish school because I  wanna be a plumber, my dad was a plumber and loved his job and it got me interested in it. If I stay in school It will take me almost 3 years to graduate properly but that's 3 more years of living off my boyfriends parents. On top of all of this my boyfriends mom lost her job and is now on call and has 4 fully grown kids who she financially supports. I was thinking of dropping school and working and saving up to move me and my boyfriend out and then getting my GED when I turn 19 ( which is in 1 year 9 months &  15 days)   Please help only serious advice please, sorry this is so long.

I told my neighbor that Series I (eye, not one) savings bonds were being sold through the US Treasury at Treasurydirect.gov and earning a 5.64% interest rate. He went to his investment advisor at the local bank who told him they were only earning a 0.7% interest rate. I thought maybe he asked about the wrong series, so I checked online for EE, E and H/HH series bonds ,all of which are earning around 1.3% right now.       So what could explain the difference in rate?

Another concern I have is the FHA loan, I only have 3% down and he's putting a 1% discount fee on the hud, when I told him I don't want to buy the rate down he said that FHA now requires that you do?? whats this clown up too. Oh another thing, I have a 698 credit score, 40% LTV and he said my rates 5.75, even though I see the rates are 5.38 for FHA, on top of that he's charging me 1k to buy it down to 5.5, shouldn't I qualify for the par FHA rate with those paticulars??

20090219181027AAwQJpP	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I break a lease if the tenant next door keeps playing her music loud and the office won't do anything?	I have complained several times about how loud the tenant in the apartment next door plays her music. The first time I complained was on 2/3/09 and I was told by a lady in the office that I could knock on the tenants door and ask her to turn down the music. However, I did not feel like I should have to do that, so I did not stay at my apartment that week so that I could avoid the noise. I contacted the office once again on 2/14/09 to complain about the noise again. I was told that they would contact the tenant and tell her to turn down her music, which she did do. After that, I had a few days of peace, but on then the nosie started again on 2/18/09. I called the office once again and was told once again that they would contact the tenant and tell her to turn her music down, which, once again the tenant did comply. However, today 2/19/2009 at around 3:30 pm, the music was loud once again. I called the office again and informed them that I called yesterday about this same problem. The lady I spoke with apologized and said she would contact the tenant. A few minutes later the music was turned down. But around 6:00 pm the music was loud once again, and this time I could not call the office since they had already closed.        I'm not one to complain and I know some things are to be expected when you live in an apartment. However, I think it's ridiculous that I have to pay rent at a place that can't control it's tenants. When I initially brought up the problem, the lady at the offcie knew exactly who I was talking about, which leads me to believe that tenant does this all the time and nothing is really done about it. I'm a college student and I have to have quiet when I'm working on a project and I don't feel like I should have to leave my apartment in order to achieve that.  If I'm not mistaken, in the lease it states that disturbing the comfort of others in prohibited conduct. I have tried calling the office several times hoping that this would be resolved, but each time it only provides a temporary solution. I guess my next step would have to be to contact the police each time her music is really loud so that I can begin documenting each incident. I do like the apartments and would like to stay, but at the rate that this is going, I don't see how that is possible. I just wanted to know if this was a legitimate reason to break the lease.

My brother worked for a guy painting a hotel that is about 3 hours from where we live. My brother is 21, I am 16. My brother talked to his boss and got me a job helping at $8/h. We've worked every day for 8-12 hours except for 1 day when we visited home every 2 weeks for about 3 months. Our boss paid some of what he owed us after about 3 weeks that I worked. Now he still owes me about $2000 dollars and my brother more than me. There is also 2 other guys working with us, one was paid off in full because he didn't work for that long, and the other one he still owes money just like me and my brother. Our boss owes another one of his workers $6000 and he told him directly that he is NOT going to pay him. I have a feeling that he will tell me and my brother the same thing that he won't pay us. Its been about 3 months since we finished working and our boss always says that he will pay us on XX/XX. When that day comes, he says he can't pay and will pay us on XX/XX. and that's been going on for 3 months. My brother wants to sue him. There are 5 people including myself who are witnesses that he doesn't pay us. What is going to happen to him? What should we do?

Dan received a severence pay of $18,000, and we were suppose to get reimbursed out of that and it never happened.

We did not have the money to shell out, but my mom and I did not want to see my sister and her kids go without a roof over their head and no electric in the house. We also did not want to see the horse that my niece has starve. My mom and I are really upset because we need that money. I want to take Michelle and Dan to court. My mom on the other hand says that we will never see the money, and if I take Michelle to court it will tear the family apart. What upsets me the most is it has been told by my brother that Dan has no intention on ever paying me or my mom back. I do not know if Dan said this or if it is Mark's opinion. I am totally confused and I do not know what to do. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I recently put down an offer on a short sale home whose purchase price was preapproved by the bank.  After waiting for the seller to sign the offer for a week (they were out of town) i was told that they signed an offer put in after mine.  But i was never told that there was multiple offers because i would have gladly increased my offer.  My real estate agent says that she wasn't aware until it was too late and she feels that the realtor for the seller only gave the seller one offer (from his client) in order to be able to take all the commission (instead of having to split it with my agent).     Does this really happen?   Isn't this unethical and can I report this somehow?   How can I keep this from happening again??

I received the keys on March 26th 2008 and signed the paperwork but I did not start paying on the house until May 08.  I know that the Housing and Economic Recovery act  says that you need to have bought your home after April 8th, 2008 to be eligible to receive a tax credit. I was wondering with my dates being so close to it, if there was any way that I too could get in on the act? My home is in San Diego, I have already lost money on it and have no extra cash to put grass and a sprinkler system in the yard, I really could use that $7,500 and believe that the bill was designed to help people in my situation. It is just so frustrating that I bought days before this act was put into place. Any advice is welcome, thanks.

Hello....I'm pretty good at doing pros and cons but this is my toughest one yet.  I have my own moving business which I have been running out of my home for 2 years now.  I cant deal with simple tasks anymore.  There are many distractions at home even with me setting aside office space.   Not to mention Im horrible at staying focused and having the "business" or "office" mindset while looking at the tv or bed in the other room.  I found an office space for only $250 (300 sq ft) with ALL utilities included.  Id have to pay for internet and phone.  I'm thinking Id hate to rent at this time with how the economy is but I keep thinking that an office away from home (2 miles) would give me the necessary discipline and focus I need.  That alone would probably give me the extra 2 moves a month it would take to cover my new office expenses.  Or should i paint my 2nd bedroom, remove the bed and make it a "true" office and stay home?  Please don't leave 1 word answers....Im really looking for some "Real" advice.   Thanks!

Now, my manager has told us that we have a quota to meet now. If we work 20 hours or less, we have to get at least 1 app a week, if we work more than 20 hours-then it has to be at least 2. They told us that if we fail to get any, then our hours will be cut because 'we've shown that we can't do it..'. I have no problems asking customers if they want to do it, but does anyone think its a little too much to cut hours because people don't want to open an account?  I feel like my managers are way focused on the credit card apps & not on how good we perform in general. I just feel like all my hard work is not getting paid off because I can't get many credit card applications. Thoughts?

Say  for example you have a part time job and a full time job at the same time You get fired from your part time job because of your own wrong doing. You apply to another job in the future. There will be no employment gap because you help the full time job. Is there any way they can tell you got fired? Can you just not reference that in your employment history and if they ask "have you ever been terminated?" you can just say "no"?

20090220230527AAlzuIo	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	First home bought just days before April 08, is there anything I can do?	I bought my first home last year. I received the keys on March 26th 2008 and signed the paperwork but I did not start paying on the house until May 08.  I know that the Housing and Economic Recovery act  says that you need to have bought your home after April 8th, 2008 to be eligible to receive a tax credit. I was wondering with my dates being so close to it, if there was any way that I too could get in on the act? My home is in San Diego, I have already lost money on it and have no extra cash to put grass and a sprinkler system in the yard, I really could use that $7,500 and believe that the bill was designed to help people in my situation. It is just so frustrating that I bought days before this act was put into place. Any advice is welcome, thanks.

Hello, currently I work as a substitute teacher and with the economy as it is I really don't make much at all. It's really just a spit in the bucket. I have so many bills and I can barely pay any of them. I make 60 dollars per day (55 once taxes are taken out) and some months I get lucky and I'm called in around 5 or 6 days but those are rare (and still pathetic @_@). And most month I only get called in around 2 times (yea, that means about $110 a MONTH) x_x. I really-----really---- need a new job. I'm in college so I have to work in the earlier part of the day (I take night classes) and I need to be free weekends because I go to church. I love working with people (I loved my job at a substitute teacher because I love working with the kids but it just isn't cutting it x_x), I'm good with art, I used to be a maid (I worked 1 day a week and made $50 a day), and I want a job that will pay me more than $110 a month for just working 2 days!!! XD       I live in a pretty small area, it's not much around here unless you drive a ways : ( .... it's about a 30 minute drive til you get to more populated areas that have stores, etc....and 50 minutes before you get to a city area x_x.       Suggestions would be wonderful!!! Please keep them generic since you obviously couldn't say "work @ the mall @ hot topic cuz it's kool" or something because who's to say I live near a mall (which I don't). Thank you!!!

I've learned as much as I can about the Obama's plan but not entirely confident in understanding the ends and outs of it. I have two properties, one I live in and the other I rent as units. Resmae has already denied my loan modification request in Jan based on that the property value has decreased and that they are concerned I won't be able to make regular payments because part of my income is the rents I receive which became a big problem last year due to a renter screwing my over for several months and other factors which have now been corrected. Problems resulted in my unable to paying the mortgage for several months. I have received a letter that they have already filed or will be filing for the foreclosure and if I understand correctly the plan won't be completely operational until March. Any and all advice would be helpful. Especially on how to get Resmae from there current stand point. It seems they are not willing to help and I don't know who or what else to turn to if the lender won't budge.   Thanks.

I put my car on the Michigan craigslist ads to sell it.  this guy from New York wrote me an email saying that he wants to get it. On his email he said he is going to send me a bank certified check but he is  sending me more than the price of my car and asked me to pay to the shipper. I said it's ok but shipper won't be able to pick up my car until check clears or I have full cash in my hand. Car was only 2g. I was little bit suspicious by the fact that he refused to give me his phone number, and how he kinda acted.(I mean paying 2g without looking/asking anything about my car, and spending couple hundred dollars for shipping when car only costs 2g?) So I sold it to different guy who lives only 30mins away from my house with cash. So now, i wrote it to this guy saying that my car broke down and won't be able to sell it no more.and i will send his check back. but He just replied by "i already sent the check , when you get it you can cash it and take $1000 out of it and send the balance to my shipper, my shipper want to shipper some of goods"... I have no clue what he is talking about......please tell me what you think and what ii should do.

I could either use the $8000 to pay off a credit card (high interest), and  the remainder of an auto loan that I have.      As an alternative I was wondering what type of investment opportunities might be more beneficial AND profitable??      I'm looking to start investing somewhat aggressively as I would like to be able to turn that $8000 into $16,000+ in a relatively short time frame (I'm thinking under a year).      Along with return on investment please include level of risk involved.       Thank you I appreciate your help.

I work in a bank's call centre, and one of our targets, is to come up with an idea, once a month, to either save costs, improve efficiency, or improve service, ie One idea I came up with was that a csa (customer service adviser) must always get a role No if they speak to another dept asking them to action something like to stop a credit card that is reported as lost, I would ask that person for their role No so if the request was not carried out it was easy to trace where it had gone wrong. I'm not just looking for ideas to blame others, the most important  ideas  are those that  will  improve our service  to our customers
