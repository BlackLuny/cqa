lqbAA0Ytaa	It is not mad; mad would be an incorrect punctuation mark. A question is suppose to end with a question mark. It is a punctuation mark (?) placed at the end of a sentence to indicate a question. <br>  <br>  Yahoo! does this to remind everyone that they are to ask a question, not chat.

Maybe they don't feel the need to show thanks because they pay you for your services. With people like that its always just business as usual. Though im sure in their minds they expect you to thank them for the paycheck. Like you said they probably do go out of the way to distance themselves from the average working class person. Bottom line I think they just have a tendency to belittle anybody who they feel is "below them". I wonder if they know that a little thanks goes along way. I feel for you.|`|492180924fe32381f3e8cd7774074fe9aa	yes it can wear you down 2 where your heart is not into it anymore 4 them.. i went through the samething with my sister, rarely did i get a thank you 4 cooking and cleaning..(it's her house) and yet when she is in game room talking 2 those strangers it's God bless you, thank you very much and your very much welcome.. she doesn't talk like that at home.. i just stopped cooking 4 her and i'm looking 4 my own place 2 live.. i don't know why appreciation is not showen.. the only difference in you and i, is you get paid, i don't.. bummer eh ~|`|rEyXxDd4aa	Maybe they are unable to show their feelings ; it can be disturbing , because it' s nice to be appreciated .

RhkKGsipaa	Try this: Click messenger top left, scroll down and click preferences then scroll down and click webcam where you can make adjustments, click o.k. To make sure it is o.k. click messenger top left, scroll down and click my webcam. and your webcam should come on. Anytime a menu drops to show the webcam name click it. You should also run your call setup. Click actions top row of the messenger window scroll down click call setup and follow the prompts. When you are chatting with someone click on webcam in the chat window. I hope that is of some help. My own opinion is that if you are going to webcam  regularly download windows live messenger to me it is far better than Yahoo messenger.<br>  <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/features" rel="nofollow">http://get.live.com/messenger/features</a>|`|Kdky4CDKaa	That is nothing to do with your web cam.

N9pKl35Xaa	I seen this so much through High School it was unbelievable. It was always the cool smart popular guys and their posse who would always start on the others. 99% of the time, the other kids would just turn around and walk away and the popular guys HATED it, they hated not getting the attention, they hated not being able to stir someone up and get something out of them.<br>  <br>  Same with the backup, one guy would get caught out by the guy he was picking on, than he would call on his back up. So the guy being picked on would stand there and call the other guy the biggest pus*y out because he started something he couldnt finish. <br>  <br>  Most of the time, it would all stop once people ignored them. They got bored of people not reacting to them so they just thought 'No use, they dont care'. So maybe just ignore them? Walk away? If that doesnt help than tell your Principle, Head Master whoever is in charge of the school.

02217d0e7d25f290ffa319e130d7b364aa	Q: What is a Top Contributor?<br>  <br>  A Top Contributor is someone in the Answers community who, through their participation on Answers, has shown that they are knowledgeable in a particular category. Each Answers user can be a Top Contributor in up to three categories.<br>  <br>  Q: How are Top Contributors determined?<br>  <br>  The Top Contributor badge is dynamic, and you earn it by being an active participant who contributes quality answers in a particular category on Answers. Anyone can earn a Top Contributor badge as it does not depend on points or level.<br>  <br>  Top Contributors are not permanent, which is to say you must continue to be an active answerer in order to retain a Top Contributor badge. Similarly, even if you are not a Top Contributor today, you can earn the badge by contributing high quality answers in any category or multiple categories of your choosing.<br>  <br>  The more actively you contribute quality answers and best answers to a particular category, the more likely you will earn a badge for your contributions in that category. Just like featured users or category leaders, the badge is another way to honor and feature community members who are actively participating and knowledgeable in particular categories on Answers.<br>  <br>  This is our first version of the Top Contributor badge, and we acknowledge that it is not perfected, yet. We will be continually improving the logic and heuristics used to choose Top Contributors in an effort to ensure that people who receive them are the most deserving. We’ve heard your feedback and we understand that there are concerns about abuse of this badge, and we will change the rules for Top Contributor as needed to combat gaming or abuse.<br>  <br>  Q: I’m a Level 1-4, why am I considered a Top Contributor?<br>  <br>  As mentioned before, an Answerer’s level or total points accrued in Answers don’t actually factor into consideration for Top Contributor status. If you are a Level 1-4 and have been selected as a Top Contributor, it is because you are actively providing quality content to a particular category.<br>  <br>  Q: I’m a Level 4+, why am I not a Top Contributor?<br>  <br>  Again, a user’s level is not the deciding factor for Top Contributor consideration. As mentioned before, Top Contributors fluctuate depending on your weekly participation habits in each category, so you may find yourself sporting an orange badge in the near future.<br>  <br>  Q: What if I don't want the Top Contributor badge?<br>  <br>  We see this as a badge of honor and want to acknowledge the time and effort that Top Contributors have put into answering questions in a particular category. We hope that Top Contributors will be proud of their badge. However, we've heard concerns from you that the badge may unfavorably bias rating and best answer selection against Top Contributors. We're investigating this further and if such bias develops we will provide you an option to hide the badge.<br>  <br>  Q: Some Top Contributors have contributed some less-than-quality Q&A to Answers, why are they still considered Top Contributors?<br>  <br>  There is a slight delay in the process of calculating and updating the Top Contributors on Answers, so there is a chance that you may see this occur from time to time. However, if Top Contributor’s Q&A becomes less than favorable, they will not remain a Top Contributor for long, as the next update will likely bump them out of the running.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also there is a rumor about a 10% best answer to make you a top contributor. Though you must keep answering.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...</a>

When you do you can set the servers as follows:<br>  Incoming (pop3) - plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com (UK pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk)<br>  Outgoing (smtp) - plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com (UK smpt.mail.yahoo.co.uk)<br>  <br>  NOTE: The same servers are used for ymail and rocketmail.

IxoBFCpTaa	>>How to become Top Contributor ?<<<br>  <br>  ? Contrary to what many think, you do not need to "not have a life" to be TC. I only come on here two hours per day.<br>  <br>  ?? To become a Top Contributor, keep these things in mind ??<br>  <br>  ?? Choose a category ??<br>  <br>  ? Pick a specific sub category of all the categories you see to the left of the page. For example, if you are good in science and mathematics, you do not receive a Top Contributor's badge for that category but for its sub categories such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. <br>  <br>  ? You can have a badge in up to three categories which will show under your badge on your profile as well as your id card, which is what you see when you scroll over an avatar.<br>  <br>  ?? Answer a lot of questions ??<br>  <br>  ? Answer many questions in the category that you choose. I would say 25 Answers per week should be a near minimum.<br>  <br>  ? Make sure you mostly answer questions you think you will receive Best Answer to. You need a certain percentage of Best Answers and the more you answer without thinking about this, the harder it will become to get a Top Contributor's badge.<br>  <br>  ?? Best Answer Accumulation ??<br>  <br>  ? Your answers should be to questions you believe you will receive a Best Answer to. Try to answer those questions that have very little or unknowledgeable answers because that gives you a better chance of receiving Best Answer.<br>  <br>  ? The Percentage of Best Answers needed is 10% in the category.<br>  <br>  ??Activity & Contribution??<br>  <br>  ? When you gain the Top Contributor's badge, you have to constantly be on the site.  However, you do not have to not have a life as many people say. Simply 1 hour a day would probably be enough. Remember, this contribution is about 25 answers per week.<br>  <br>  ⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙<br>  <br>  ??Here are some Hints??<br>  ? The Y!A staff keeps the formula hidden so users will not abuse their rights. But the formula seems to be like this: <br>  ○○ 10% Best Answer Percentage<br>  ○○ 200 points per week<br>  <br>  ? Users qualified for the badge will receive it on Monday Morning 12:00 AM California time.<br>  ? Two categories do not provide a Top Contributor's badge because they are only for entertainment; these are:<br>  ○○  Polls & Surveys<br>  ○○ Jokes & Riddles<br>  ? It is okay to vote for yourself with your only account when your answers to questions are in voting. However, it is not okay to use multiple accounts to do so as this is considered cheating.<br>  <br>  ▓ ? ? ? ? ⊙ ◎ ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace ?<br>  ^_^|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category.

C6jFigESaa	Many thanks for taking this to my attention. <br>  <br>  <br>  I have investigated the member's contents and saw that he is an unwelcome member. As a result, I have reported him to the Staff.<br>  <br>  In the future, I ask that you don't post links in your questions to call out another member in the Answers Community.<br>  <br>  To report a person's complete profile, please email the URL of the violator's profile to: y_answrs_team@yahoo.com ( the missing E in AnswErs is deliberate.)<br>  <br>  You don't need to report this particular individual at this time, for I have already did. And rest assured the matter will be solved.<br>  <br>  Take care, and thanks for wanting to help get rid of abuse on Yahoo!  Answers :-)
6qsTmMQaaa	Say you want to add an Avril Lavigne song to your profile, you can type her name into the search bar. When entries come up, make sure you click the one that says "official" beneath it. Then, you can find the songs that she has. Click "Add to Playlist" next to the one you want to use. Good luck.
cdgm85A6aa	I don't check back on all of the questions I answer to see all the thumbs up/thumbs down I receive but I don't ever recall getting more than 2 or 3. I steer clear of controversial questions so maybe that is why my thumbs down count isn't higher.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	6 sad really it's like you can't have your own opinion on stuff|`|tdQTZPI7aa	I have no idea since I never look back at a question|`|C7umw5Vpaa	Last time I checked, there were 4 thumbs-down. It was my fault, I guess. I didn't stay on topic and because they were being biased. But mostly it is because I can be confusing and don't explain myself thoroughly.|`|GYkfqnMfaa	Lol! I get thumb downs usually for questions on religion. I've received 8 for explaining why I didn't believe in God.

They are ignorant, or 2.They are incredibly selfish and self-centered,  or 3.They are heartless or 4. They have no conscience, etc.  Next time be more specific.|`|t7cuerySaa	i got 4-5 when i answered this stupid Twilight fan about her obsession towards Edward Cullen in Video Games section.i told her to get off from there because obsessing about crappy fantasy romance novel character is really stupid,Edward Cullen has nothing to with Video games and be 10 years old some else.there were 6 girls answering her question saying Twilight rocks while i'm the one who say Twilight sucks!
SOxdyWQOaa	wait 4 to 5 hours and pick one|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	You have to wait 4 hours then you can choose best answer. <br>  Go to your question and you will see the blue bar under the answers <br>  Click on the one that you think is the best answer.<br>  You can rate the answer by giving 1-5 stars<br>  You can also leave a comment<br>  If you chose your best answer for your question then you get 3 points back. Hope this helps!!!

If I put a uk in the address bar then it'll take me to a UK version, with very few questions. At the moment I'm on the US server so it's just called Yahoo Answers. When I log onto the Australia one, it says Yahoo7 Answers (Yahoo is linked to a TV channel 7 here in Australia). You can filter the questions with reasonable accuracy (there's a drop-down menu on left) but I prefer to see everything English-language.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|CB15kchkaa	It is both annoying and refreshing to have UK answers littered with non UK answerers.

(If you remember them, they used to bring out gimmicky gadgets at xmas time and plaster them all through your commercial break).<br>  I think on the English speaking sites you get a crossover point where the UK and Canada and Australia and the US of A meet, and it can be rather annoying to have someone answer your questions about your rights, or your neighbours wall, with something applicable only outside of the UK. And even more annoying is an American trying to tell a joke which is nearly as cringeworthy as reading the praise his fellow countrymen give him in appreciating of it!<br>  Still, it can be nice to see how the other half lives, it sort of makes you proud to be British!|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Yes, it is filtered, but the filter is a bit shagged to be honest.<br>  <br>  You can't blame Americans though, I think the problem is that there isn't a Yahoo Answers site specific to them - there's only answers.yahoo.com, which shows ALL English language questions by default. There is an option on the .com site to display USA questions only, but it isn't the default option so most of the users probably don't even know it's there.<br>  <br>  I think having all English questions pooled together actually makes a lot of sense for some question categories (Computers and Internet for example). It's mainly for things like news and events that it would be better to keep them separate.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	It's easy enough to only view questions from UK & Ireland, and the same for people in other countries, say the US, to view US Questions Only.  <br>  <br>  I think it's just that some people don't really know how to use this, and they just stick to the All English Questions setting.|`|C7umw5Vpaa	I think it's annoying, interesting and nice. Annoying, because I go to the celebrities section and all I see are Jade Goody questions and I have no idea who she is. Then, I search around and it turns out she's a reality tv star who's ill with Cancer and although she has a terminal disease some just don't care and just hate on the woman. Rants about how horrible she is as a person. I don't know much about her so, that's all I know. Interesting because it's impressive how illiterate and immature some Americans can be, and how tactful, mature and charming you guys can be. We've been called self-indulgent, too. Nice, because it's just nice knowing how other people live their everyday-life and what their views stand on whatever subject there is. And We're not that different. Just the culture. :)

PDB2YbA4aa	Questions are removed by 2 community members with good standing in their report status. There are various reasons why you get your questions removed. However, in your case, you probably received a violation. I would read the Terms of Use (in the sources), check your e-mail, and if you can't find anything related to the reason your question was removed, then appeal. You can do this by clicking the "appeal" link in your e-mail.|`|suPD7c3gaa	Maybe it might have been a good idea if you gave a few examples of your questions. Then someone could explain to you why they were reported.  Look at them. What do they all have in common?  Maybe even you could figure it out.  Clearly you haven't even tried to look at the Yahoo! Answers Community Guidelines to find out why all your questions are violations. It is too lengthy to put here, but you might want to take a look.  There's a link at the bottom of every page!  On top of the list of most common violations is  chatting, followed closely by soliciting, not a question or answer and point gaming... to name a few.

The point of the site is to share information.  Thumbs up and down mean mean nothing.  I wouldn't take much stock for either of them.  We all know there are people who scroll through answers giving thumbs down just for kicks, but people do the same for thumbs up too... giving them just to be nice whether the answer is a good answer or now.  I've seen thumbs up given for wrong answers more than for good answers.|`|gpON465Iaa	There is no accountability with anoniminity, emotions aside they are careless, not mean, but you are nice to care.

8yE2sYGeaa	Because I, in my arrogance and disconcern, felt the question had no true merit and i was able to get enough reports filed against it to get it removed.<br>  <br>  (OK, I don;t do that, but this is how trolls think and operate)|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Questions usually get deleted if they breach the Yahoo guidelines, and have been reported by someone. You have not told us what the questions were so that's the only reason I can give you at the moment.  Also your questions could have been more like chat rather then a question, again this is against the guidelines.|`|AA11408911	Questions are generally removed for one of the following reasons:<br>  <br>  (1) The author of the question manually remove their question. The option to do so can be found under the pencil (edit) option on all open questions.<br>  <br>  (2) The question was reported by two trusted members of the community for violating the community guidelines. Such content shall be removed automatically and the author of the question shall be sent a violation notice and the option to appeal such removal.<br>  <br>  (3) The community reported the best answer to a resolved question. If two or more trusted users report the best answer, it shall be removed along with the question.<br>  <br>  (4) The community voted no best answer on a question within community voting. If a 'no best answer' majority vote is established, the question is removed and the author's 5 points are returned.<br>  <br>  (5) Members of the customer care team manually removed the content.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.

However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.<br>    <br>    * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.<br>  <br>    * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.<br>  <br>    * Close any links to your 360, and email.<br>  <br>    * Delete your open questions and answers.<br>  <br>    * Set your Network and Q&A to private.<br>  <br>    * Delete your contacts and fans.

nErAWfHxaa	You can only delete questions that you asked or answers that you've given BEFORE the question is resolved or put into voting. If a "best answer" has been chosen or it's "in voting" then only Yahoo can delete them. To delete an answer before the question is in voting or resolved, people just click the "delete" word that appears in small type right under their answer.<br>  <br>  To delete a question, you click on the toolbar below the question on the pencil icon. However, you lost 5 pts. when you asked the question and you don't get the 5 pts. back.<br>  <br>  You delete on answers by clicking back on the question that you answered, scrolling down to your answer and clicking the “delete” link that shows under your answer with other options such as “Edit.”<br>  <br>  However, if you choose a "best answer" then you get 3 pts. back. And, sorry, I don't know a way to “clean up” your Q&A. You can add information, such as explaining what you meant if you had typos by adding a comment to a resolved question, but you can't delete. To add information, again, you click on the pencil icon (if it's not resolved) or click on the word comments under the answer if it's resolved.<br>  <br>  ONCE A QUESTION IS IN VOTING OR RESOLVED, only Yahoo can delete the question or answers and, generally, they only delete something for a violation of the rules.

9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.
