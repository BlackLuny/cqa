The big bang theory seems to be falling apart under scrutiny based on new data that suggests matter is unevenly distributed throughout the Universe. Phenomenon such as conciousness, dark energy/matter, and entropy suggests that we still lack an enormous amount of information pertaining to creation. Many have concluded that perhaps there was  an intelligent designer, due to a lack of evedince to the contrary. This is extremely controversial due to the fact that this theory has been rejected by science for years, but until a better theory comes along I will choose to believe in intelligent design.|`|stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a>

However, your body can only utilize the simple sugars themselves.  Hence, in the small intestine, you have cells called enterocytes that make enzymes that break apart carbohydrates into their simple sugar components which can be absorbed.  In the case of lactose, the enzyme is called lactase.<br>  <br>  The absorption of these sugars is done by a type of epithelial cell in the small intestine.  The term basolateral applies to this cell.  The side of the cell that comes in contact with the food in the intestine is called the apical surface.  The opposite side is called the basolateral surface.

That's what I call getting scared in advance. <br>  Anyway, you don't need to be too worried about spiders. The spiders that we most regularly get in houses in Australia are Huntsman spiders, Daddy Long Legs spiders (sometimes called Cellar spiders in the U.S.) - neither of which are harmful to humans - and a few other small spiders. <br>  Daddy Long Legs are good to have around. They actually kill other spiders and insects, and they won't do you any harm. Huntsman spiders are big, but they always run away from you if they have a choice. Most of the other little spiders that we get in houses just make a web in a corner and you don't notice them, and they don't bother you.<br>  The main reason I replied was to mention the best ways to keep Huntsman spiders out of your home, as there are a few things that work well. Where I used to live, I would find massive Huntsman spiders in my home all the time, at first. That doesn't always happen when you move to a new place, and I've lived in other places where I very rarely see them, too. Anyway, the way to keep them out is to have your home well-screened. This works in two ways. It keeps most of the spiders out, but it also keeps out insects, which is a large part of the reason the spiders come inside in the first place. The other tip is to keep your garden tidy. Huntsman spiders like palm leaves and other messy plants. If you get rid of fallen palm fronds and other garden litter, that will get rid of many of them as well.<br>  Those are a couple of tips on how to get rid of spiders if they do happen to be a problem, but the fact is it's likely you won't have a spider problem to start with. In many places, you will very rarely see a spider in your home, so don't be worried about it.|`|LV3Lf6byaa	no, not more than anywhere else.

No even functions are one-to-one. There are other types of functions, like monotonic, inverse, and periodic, but they don't really directly relate to the questions you're bringing up.

AA10927246	Think of most whole numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, etc.)<br>  <br>  What happens when you multiply any number by those numbers?  They get bigger, right?<br>  <br>  Now what happens when you multiply by 1?  The numbers don't change at all, right?  1 is known as the "multiplicative identity" which means when you multiply anything by 1, it is still the same number.<br>  <br>  Now fractions (between 0 and 1) are interesting in that they make the thing you are multiplying smaller.  But that's not too surprising, is it?<br>  <br>  In English if you say "I am taking 'half' of something" you are getting part of the whole, a fraction of the whole, but not the whole thing.  If you take half of a pie, you don't get the whole pie, you get less.<br>  <br>  Similarly if you take 1/3 of the pie, or 1/4 of the pie, etc. you get less and less.<br>  <br>  If you take any fraction with 1 in the numerator and multiply it by another number, you can see that the numerator doesn't change, but the denominator gets bigger.  So that makes the overall number smaller.<br>  <br>  And even if you are multiplying by a fraction like 2/3, because you are multiplying the numerator by less than the denominator, the denominator gets bigger faster, relative to the numerator.  So again the result of multiplying fractions is something smaller.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	This is true only when you have a proper fraction. That is a fraction that has a numerator smaller than the denominator. Example 3/4.<br>  <br>  It is not true if the numerator and denominator are equal because then you would be multiplying by 1 and the product would be neither smaller or larger.<br>  <br>  If the numerator is greater than the denominator the fraction is improper. Example 5/4. In this case what's being multiplied gets larger.<br>  5/4 X 1/2 = 5/8 which is greater than 1/2.<br>  <br>  Multiplying by for example 1/3 is the same as dividing by 3. So of course this makes the product smaller.|`|YvvYtsjNaa	I think the dilemma here is as follows:  <br>  <br>  When you MULTIPLY 4X2 you get 8, that is MORE!<br>  <br>  When you DIVIDE 4 by 2 you get 2, that is LESS!  <br>  <br>  That principle is different when you multiply and divide fractions.<br>  <br>  When you MULTIPLY 1/2 X 1/4 you get 1/8, that is LESS!<br>  <br>  When you DIVIDE 1/2 by 1/4 you get 2, that is MORE!<br>  <br>  As the King in the musical "The King and I" liked to say, "Is a puzzlement."<br>  <br>  See, actually, you get the opposite.  When you MULTIPLY 1/2 X 1/4 you actually are getting MORE.  More "fractionated."*  1/8 is MORE of a fraction then either 1/4 or 1/2.<br>  <br>  When you DIVIDE 1/2 by 1/4 you actually are getting LESS.  Less "fractionated."*  2 is MORE than either 1/4 or 1/2.<br>  ----------------------------<br>  *Made up word<br>  <br>  For some really simple explanations of fractions go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2205113/An-Introduction-to-Fractions" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/2205113/An-Int...</a><br>  <br>  You may also find it easier to see the "why'" of fractions by working with their decimal equivalent.  Just be careful about decimal placement.<br>  <br>  For a better, funnier approach to math, the character Danae in the comic, "Non-Sequitur"  (the best comic in the world) says you should START with an answer (any answer), first.  Then work backwards and fill in the steps that would give you that answer.  For example, start out with the ANSWER 144, then go back and fill in the steps.  Could be 12X12 or 10X12 or 288 divided by 2.

4MtR8MLpaa	The term "black ice" has changed over the years. 40-50 years ago back ice was very dangerous because of how it formed. Today people see rain/snow/sleet and see the temperature below 32 degrees and so they are careful because ice is expected.<br>  <br>  Black ice isn't formed that way at all. It is formed without any rain/sleet/snow or even yard sprinklers running. Black ice is formed on clear cold nights because water is a byproduct of the car engines. This water vapor comes out of the exhaust pipe and drips on to the road where is promptly freezes coating the roadway in a layer of ice.<br>  <br>  Drivers don't expect it because there hasn't been any precipitation so they don't look for it and even looking is difficult because it is dark.<br>  <br>  That is why black ice is dangerous.|`|AA12091077	"Black Ice" is not actually black - it is clear, and as such, on black tarmac roads, is very hard to spot...|`|Vf2lnEH7aa	Black ice is a thin sheet of ice that is very transparent.

The means by which this happens is the transparency itself. The ice does hardly anything to light that passes through it. Black ice is dangerous for vehicles because its easy to slide on it. A car could swerve severely or slow down at a very low rate because of it. As for people on foot, its easy to not see the ice. I have slipped and fell plenty of times because of black ice.

wvAhCsxqaa	You are right, for the first several decades after the first recorded discovery of a "dinosaur", it was only speculation, or a hypopthesis, that they were hairless. Recent comparisons of DNA from dinosaurs (yes, some of it from mosquitos in amber like in Jurassic Park) with that of both modern reptiles and modern birds have verified the skinless hypothesis.<br>  <br>  Another reason it is widely accepted is because at the time of the dinosaurs, up until their extinction 65 million years ago, the climate on earth was dramatically different than it is now. Hair would have been a bad trait for dinosaurs to have, because they would overheat. The ability to regulate their own temperatures given the extremely hot climate was very important. <br>  <br>  You know how reptiles usually live in dry, hot places? Well that is what earth was like pretty much everywhere, so dinosaurs thrived.|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Well dinosaurs are related to both reptiles and birds.They did not have fur back then because back then it was very hot and if they did have fur they'd be itching everywhere though they did have feathers because they were related to bird.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	We should clone dinosaurs when we get the chance and train them to eat Creationists/Americans.|`|rkkIyPoQaa	The idea of dinosaurs being traditional reptiles is archaic and outdated.

Some now classify dinosaurs as part of a bigger group called archosaurs which include crocodiles and birds.<br>  <br>  Paleontologists have found feather imprints in the rock around some species, so it is now known that many different dinosaur species had some variation of feathers. If there are feathers, it's extremely unlikely there would have been fur.|`|BTk2yLqbaa	Unlike true reptiles, dinosaurs probably had elevated metabolic rates but they certainly didn't have fur.

JsiELu6xaa	Sorry dude, but the speed of light is the universal speed limit. The problem with your argument is that reaching the speed of light does not require infinite acceleration but infinite force. See to accelerate an object you must apply force. But as an objects Velocity approaches the speed of light it gains mass and time for it slow down (Special Relativity). At the exact speed of light the objects mass becomes infinite and time for it as it appears to an observer stops, so the only way to accelerate an object with infinite density is to apply an infinite amount of force. The issue is in creating an engine that produces infinite force, it just cant be done. But that does not mean that reaching 99.9% the speed of light is not theoretically possible. You just cant match its speed.<br>  <br>  Oh and as for dedicating your life to finding such a way, I would reconsider. There is no way short of opening a wormhole can allow anything to travel in the universe at speeds faster than the speed of light. And it only works with worm holes because you are using a theoretical 5th dimension where the two points are actually very close to one another. By traversing this 5th dimension you can arrive from your starting place to your destination much faster than if you were traveling at sublight speeds in the normal 4-d universe. But the catch is that your velocity never has to approach light speed, your just taking a shortcut through another dimension of the universe to bypass all of the apparent space between two points. But the problem with worm holes is that they require us to bend space time to the point of ripping. then we have to stitch the two "holes" together with a space time "throat" and some how keep it all from collapsing in on itself because of gravity. The amount of energy needed to do something like this only exists on the cosmic scale. It is over a quadrillion times the amount of energy we are currently capable of producing. Nothing short of LITERALLY Harnessing the power of a star in some way could even remotely work.|`|Gmvldblraa	Good luck but you are probably going to waste  your life. <br>  There is a huge amount of evidence that approaching the speed of light really does increase your mass towards infinity ( and hence requires increasingly enormous amounts     of energy to get an further increase in Velocity) and that the "light barrier" really is insurmountable. Our current understanding of Physics and maths might well be flawed but any new paradigm will still need to incorporate and explain all the  current data. It will be very tough to work around to something new.<br>  And remember the words of Pasteur " The greatest derangement of the human mind is to believe in something because one wishes it to be so."<br>  Physicists do not believe in the "light barrier" because they wish it to be so. They believe in it because it seems that's  how the Universe is, and nothing would please them more than to shown that their viewpoint is flawed. But it isn't.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	As an object's speed increases, its mass increases.  At the speed of light, the object's mass goes to infinity.  <br>  <a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy99/phy99186.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ph...</a>|`|6uo0NbUgaa	It may be "flawed" but here's what the idea is behind the impossibility of reaching light-speed:<br>  The theory of relativity shows that our ways of calculating speeds and adding vectors does not work for very high speeds.  So 50km/s+50km/s pretty much equals 100km/s but 90% of the speed of light + 90% of the speed of light doesn't get anywhere close to 180% of the speed of light.  <br>  <br>  To calculate a velocity from ALL frames of reference we use a tricky formula:<br>  U=(v1+v2)/(1+(v1*v2)/c) Where c is the speed of light.<br>  So basically if v1 or v2 or both are c then the answer is c because the speed of light is the same in all reference frames.  Also, you can't get a U greater than c with this equation.<br>  <br>  To totally understand this you'd have to be Albert Einstein (or extremely smart) but I hope this makes some sense.|`|l1vKzMATaa	Ripeforchange and Rex make some very logical statements that are correct.  But keep in mind that the best way to understand light is that its a particle and a wave that can be blocked by any shadow as stated by Newton.  The speed of light speed on average is 3X10^8 and can be calculated according to c=h x wavelength. You probably already know this but their is something you dont know that even for me still brings a little doubt.  Their is a statement made by Einstein after his photoelectric effect and his article on Relativity that states that any object traveling in space at the speed of light will cause the universe to end in an instant.  This was told to me by a very intellectual Physics teacher who studied this over and over and who very specifically to our class serveral times.  He also said it because some very abnormal people kept stating that light is infinte when its not.

AbRfd29Haa	It is a certainty... unless we do something about it. We are the first species on earth that has the choice. <br>  <br>  The small problem is one we think about more often -- we're also the first species that can wipe itself out. We could have a nuclear war.. though we seem to been smart enough to avoid that, at least among the first round of Nuclear Powers. We might yet poison ourselves in various ways.. there are many ways we could go extinct. <br>  <br>  But at least in these things, we have a choice, and hopefully mankind as a whole will make the right decisions. In other things, we may only have a slight edge over the dinosaurs. If there's another extinction-level asteriod headed our way, for example, we will know about it in advance, and maybe we can do something about it, maybe not. Chances are, even with that, we could see that some select view could survive underground. <br>  <br>  A similar threat could be native.. a supervolcano, such as the one that's basically covering all of the Yellowstone Park area, could erupt and dump so much stuff into the atmosphere, that even if you weren't vaporized by the firestorms, there would be so little sunlight that all plant life would die off (good news for the plants.. some seeds would  still be viable tens or hundreds of years later, once the dust fully settles). <br>  <br>  Another doomsday senario is a deadly illness.. something with 100% fatality, but slow enough to attack that you get infected before you get sick, it a real threat. We haven't had this, but there have certainly been viruses with near 100% fatality, and certainly those that spread really fast. In the distant past, these did a pretty good job at wiping out large chunks of humanity -- we would be foolish to think it can't happen again, or worse. <br>  <br>  It might not require all humans to die off to essentially wipe out humanity... check out the science fiction novel "Evolution" by Stephen Baxter. In this, he's extrapolating from current thinking to follow the rise and fall of intelligent life. Thinking as we do is really expensive -- it takes a ton of energy. If we had a bad enough catostrophy to wipe out civilization and prevent it from reforming, we might well evolve past sentience, just as a survival mechanism. <br>  <br>  The big maybe in all of this is... all of these scenarios fail once/if we colonize space. If humanity can travel to other worlds and establish independent colonies, then there's every chance humanity (or our children) will last until the end of time. We're good at this... colonizing and adapting. <br>  <br>  Right now, we lack the technology to make this easy and the motivation to make it critical. This will change. Today, we're sending robots to Mars or Venus or Jupiter which are little more than glorified R/C aircraft. In 100 years, we will be sending robots potentially more intelligent, in the way we measure intelligence, than humans are. They'll be able to survive in harsh environments we can't, build habitats for humans, and start terraforming places like Mars (curiously, we already know how to do that.. the same things causing global warming on Earth would warm Mars, thicken the atmosphere, and render it at least habitable). We could do this today, but there are bigger problems. We WILL do this in the not-too-distant future, assuming we last that long. Our machines will insist on it.... unless they go all Cylon/Terminator on us.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	Kenneth is right, of all the species that have ever lived, almost all of them are extinct.  Humans are still newcomers as a species.  Dinosaurs were dominant for over 100 million years.

Also if you have a fraction as "x", whatever the denominator is, skip that many numbers when plugging it in into the table of values, this ensures that you want get any more fractions.

The majority of the cells all contain these chloroplasts. It helps making energy for the plant. If I put a plant in a room with only green light, it will die in a week. But that's a different story.

5DRCrwU2aa	When doing this problem, you can look at how much Sr you have remaining. In this case, its .01% remaining. So since we know half of the substance disappears in 28 years, we need to figure out how many times we have to cut the Sr amount in half to get .01% left over. You always start with 100%. So after 1 half-life you are down to 50%, after the 2nd you are at 25%, and after the 3rd 12.5%. In the end, to get to .01% you have to go through 10 half lives. So then you multiply 10 by the number of years per half life, in this problem its 28 years. So 10 x 28 = 280 years. Good luck!

So, base equals 8 inches. Since the given triangle is a right angle, isosceles triangle, then the hypotenuse of the triangle is side sqrt of 2. Through that, we can get the side by dividing 8 by sqrt of 2. It will give us 8 sqrt of 2 all over 2. We can now get the area of the triangle by the formula 1/2 bh. The base and the height can be both the congruent sides since they are perpendicular. Substituting to the formula, 1/2 (8 sqrt of 2 / 2) (8 sqrt of 2 / 2 ). Giving : 16 sq. inches.<br>  We need now to know the area of the circle. Formula: pi r^2.<br>  Substituting: 3.14 * 4 ^ 2<br>  3.14 * 16 = 50.24 sq. inches<br>  Then, we can get the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the triangle from the area of the circle:<br>  50.24 sq inches - 16 sq. inches = 34.24 sq. inches<br>  Answer: 34.24 sq. inches.

The extra dimensions are spacelike. We perceive only three spatial dimensions, and no physical experiments have confirmed the reality of additional dimensions. A possible explanation that has been suggested is that space acts as if it were "curled up" in the extra dimensions on a subatomic scale, possibly at the quark/string level of scale or below. Another less-held fringe view asserts that dimensions beyond the fourth progressively condense timelines and universes into single spatial points in the above dimension, until the tenth, where a 0-dimensional point equates to all possible timelines in all possible universes<br>  <br>  But if you see 4D mentioned in advertising/marketing, it usually means they are adding something else to stimulate your senses.

k5Ece8BTaa	Stars condense from giant clouds of molecular gas (mostly hydrogen). A cloud may be disturbed, perhaps by a passing star or shock waves from a distant supernova explosion. This can cause the cloud to be unstable, and regions of gas start to collapse in on themselves due to gravity. As the clouds collapse and become more dense, the gravitational pull attracts more gas, and the process continues. Pressure and density rise, and with pressure, so does the temperature of the centre of this gas cloud. Eventually the temperature becomes high enough for nuclear reactions to begin, and a star is born. <br>  <br>  In spiral galaxies, like our own, we observe star formation predominantly in spiral arm features. We believe this to be due to a density wave that causes gas to collapse to form giant molecular clouds as it propagates around the galaxy. <br>  <br>  The brightest (most massive) stars fuse their hydrogen (and then heavier elements) at such a rate that they only live for a few million years, therefore these cannot be seen very far from current star-forming regions. These bright stars heat and ionise the surrounding hydrogen gas (ie their radiation strips the electrons from the hydrogen atoms) which emits light to appear as a nebula, eg the Orion Nebula. Because the gas is hot, it expands into the giant molecular cloud, driving a shock-wave that promotes the further collapse of gas into stars, so star formation spreads throughout the giant molecular cloud. <br>  <br>  It is thought that lower mass stars (like the Sun) may condense from lower density, lower temperature molecular clouds, and certainly are not hot enough to ionise the surrounding gas to form nebulae, but otherwise the condensation mechanism is the same.|`|AA11614996	Hi: <br>  <br>  a star is formed when a very large  size dust cloud about one light to two years across get compress either by a exploding star or a massive object entering it and the gravity from  and the static charges attract other dust and gas particles toward it. As they move toward the massive object  some of them get stuck to it and the gravity increases which cause even more dust and gas to come toward it and sticking to it. In time the size and mass increases on the massive object until the pressure along with a lot friction cause by the gases rubbing against each other  raises the temperature  to 100 million degrees and the Thermonuclear fusion start happening; which release a shock wave which expands out from the core of the star all the way out to the edge of the gas cloud blowing away any loose gases and dust left around the star away . The Star begins a titanic struggle the between gravity try to compress it to nothingness and the Thermonuclear force trying to keep it from happening  In the process it create heat and lights for the rest of the star life|`|QxYWjsngaa	A star is formed out of cloud of cool, dense molecular gas. In order for it to become a potential star, the cloud needs to collapse and increase in density. <br>  <br>  There are two common ways this can happen: it can either collide with another dense molecular cloud or it can be near enough to encounter the pressure caused by a giant supernova. Several stars can be born at once with the collision of two galaxies. In both cases, heat is needed to fuel this reaction, which comes from the mutual gravity pulling all the material inward.<br>  <br>  What happens next is dependent upon the size of the newborn star; called a protostar. Small protostars will never have enough energy to become anything but a brown dwarf (think of a really massive Jupiter). A brown dwarf is sub-stellar object that cannot maintain high enough temperatures to perpetuate hydrogen fusion to helium. Some brown dwarfs can technically be called stars depending upon their chemical composition, but the end result is the same; it will cool slowly over billions of years to become the background temperature of the universe.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	Clyde is very well correct.

And you have a .246 M solution meaning that there are .246 moles/Liter. So first you should convert your 50 mL to Liters by dividing by 1000, which gives you .05 L of aluminum nitrate. Then you can use factor label method to solve for the number of moles in .05 L. To do this:<br>  <br>  .05 L  x   .246 moles/ 1 Liter = .0123 moles of Al(NO3)3<br>  <br>  Then calculate your new concentration by putting it into moles/Liter again. So divide .0123 moles by 1 Liter and you get .0123 M as your final answer.

This is caused by blood entering the needle during the procedure as a result of accidentally hitting a blood vessel; it's also known as a "bloody tap."<br>  <br>  The other possibility is some kind of a "brain bleed," or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

If this barrier has been breached by trauma or hemorrhage, blood will appear in the CSF.  <br>  <br>  You differentiate between the two either by repeating the tap later, or by a physician's determination that the amount of blood is insignificant and likely resulted from a traumatic LP.

Meaning for any real number less than L, there is an element of E that is greater than it.  In particular, consider the number L - 1/n, where n is some positive integer.  Since this number is less than L, there is some a_n in E with a_n > L - 1/n.  And this is true for every positive n.  So we get a sequence of points in E which converge to L.  But Since E is closed, this limit must be in E, hence L is in E.  That's it!

rH6dNsR7aa	1. Chains of amino acids, when folded into shapes conductive to chemical processes are in fact proteins. The wonder of proteins is their specificity, allowing them to interact wit certain molecules exclusively. Additionally, proteins have four structures: The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in the chain. The secondary structure involves the weak bonds associated with the chain, forming twists and bends. The teritary structure involves how these twists and ends interact forming a specific three-dimensional shape. The Quaternary structure involves the protein's interaction with other proteins to form a complex. Therefore, the short answer would be true.<br>  <br>  2. When a ribosome binds with it's subunits to mRNA, it begins protein synthesis, bringing in tRNA bound to their specific amino acids. As soon as the ribosomal complex leaves the start codon, it opens up the initiation codon for another ribosome to bind for translation. Therefore, it is True that mRNA can be translated by many ribosomes at once.<br>  <br>  3. mRNA are used as the "blueprint" for the protein. tRNA, on the other hand, is the compliment, 3 base pair codon used to match amino acids to the portion of mRNA that it codes for. It can therefore be said that it is false: mRNA is translated into proteins with the help of tRNA to match match up (like a glove on a hand). tRNA does not, in itself, code for anything<br>  <br>  4.

You may have to go through many hoops to actually get approval for this, and you have to be able to provide adequate containment and care for your animals.  You would be inspected by the USDA regularly and could be heavily penalized for having sub-par conditions for your animals.

e039281ee30116d662b49a163b467be3aa	Hola. A ver si puedo explicarte bien por este medio.<br>  Como eres principiante, te daré un muy buen método.Tienes la nalga del paciente, con un bolígrafo haz una cruz pasando por el centro de la nalga (+) (imagina que es una nalga, jajaja). Ahora tienes 4 cuadrantes (valga la redundancia), en el cuadrante superior izquierdo(digamos que es la nalga izquierda), o sea, el que dé al hueso de la cadera, allí marcas otra cruz y en el centro de esa cruz ( o cerca) allí pinchas. Al pinchar, debes hacerlo con determinación y no usar mucha fuerza, ya que tengas la aguja dentro, sácas un poco el émbolo de la aguja con tu dedo pulgar, para ver si no pinchaste en un vaso sanguíneo o venita, si al hacer ésto ves que hay sangre dentro de la jeringa, retirala inmediatamente y pincha en otro sitio cercano, pero repites el procedimiento anterior. No olvides sacar todo el contenido de aire de la jeringa antes de inyectar y tampoco olvides lavar bien tus manos y desinfectarlas, así como el área dónde inyectarás.<br>  Espero haber sido clara y que puedas hacerlo.<br>  Saluditos y suerte|`|368407779143c4323ffd3fb0244979b0aa	Todo depende que tipo de medicamento y cual sea la indicacion,<br>  como ya te han dicho aqui algunos miembros, existen varios tipos.<br>  intravenosa, intramuscular, tb, test, etc.....<br>  <br>  Lo mas importante es que hay algunas inyecciones que dicen via intramuscular, pero dependiendo de el medicamento y la jeringa es si se inyectara en la nalga (gluteo) o en el brazo (deltoide) aunque ambos son intramusculares, algunos pueden causar da?o al deltoide.<br>  <br>  Tambien esta la tb test, que es con la jeringa para la insulina y la aguja va casi acostada.<br>  <br>  Y la mas importante es el "z track" que es la inyeccion para el hierro,.esta requiere especial cuidado ya que puede causar da?os irreversibles. <br>  En esta se presiona la nalga por la parte de la orilla presionando hacia abajo con la mano entonces se coloca la jeringa y se inyecta muy despacio, sin soltar la nalga presionada hacia abajo, con esa misma mano que se presiona la nalga se agarra la jeringa y con la otra mano se inyecta. <br>  una vez terminado el liquido se saca la jeringa con cuidado y en la misma direccion, y se mantiene por 15 segundos la nalga presionada por su orilla y despues poco a poco se regresa la piel de la nalga a su lugar.<br>  <br>  y la regular intramuscular,<br>  <br>  se hace una cruz y se escoge la parte superior de afuera de los 4 cuadros, de que tan abajo o tan arriba depende de la carnosa que este la nalga, se limpia con alcohol, y yo de preferencia caliento con el mismo algodon un poco el musculo para que duela menos, inyectas derecho y con la fuerza suficiente para que no entre solo una parte de la aguja tiene que entrar todo, po que en algunos casos que se inyecta con miedo no entra toda o rebota la aguja en la piel.<br>  otro metodo que yo utilizo es que le pido al paciente que respire profundo dos veces, en la segunda vez que este soltando el aire, ahi es cuando se inyecta, de esa forma no le das tiempo de que pueda poner dura la nalga y pueda desgarrar el musculo.<br>  <br>  la velocidad con la que se inyectara dependera de el liquido que sse inyecte, y una vez terminado de introducir el liquido, entonces se scara rapido y de derecho.<br>  poniendo rapidamente el algodon en el lugar inyectado y si no hay sangre entonces ya esta listo,<br>  <br>  si hay sangre, presiona con el algodon no tan fuerte, por un minuto de esta manera las plaquetas cicatrizan y paran la sangre.<br>  <br>  Nunca inyectar en medio por que por ahi pasa la ciatica y si se inyecta ahi puedes ocacionar un ataque anafilactico, o sea se cierran los bronquios y no hay manera de que entre aire a los pulmones causando en cuestion de minutos la muerte.<br>  o dejar a la persona paralitica,<br>  <br>  por eso siempre el area superior de la orilla para evitar eso.<br>  <br>  Puedes practicar con una naranja mientras. para que se quite el miedo.<br>  <br>  cualquier duda estoy para servirte saludos|`|37b0d01c1eed545c0c36d24b9b730605aa	Eso depende de donde quieras aplicarla, porque las hay:<br>  Intramusculares<br>  Intravenosas<br>  Intramedulares<br>  Intraarteriales<br>  Intraarticulares<br>  Intracardiacas<br>  Subdermicas<br>  Subcutaneas<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la tecnica universal es:<br>  1.- Verificar SIEMPRE que es lo que vas a aplicar y asegurarte que a quien se la vas a aplicar NO ES ALERGICO a ella.<br>  2.- Lavarte las manos.<br>  3.- Desinfectar el frasco de donde va a ser tomado el medicamento.<br>  4.- Desinfectar la zona donde sera aplicada.<br>  5.- Expulsar cualquier burbuja de aire.<br>  6.- Aspirar antes de empujar el embolo (asi estaras seguro de que una sustancia que sera intramuscular, no vaya directamente al torrente sanguineo).<br>  7.- Hacer una leve presion en el sitio inyectado (ojo, solo presion, nada de masajes).<br>  8.- Observar al paciente algunos minutos antes de que se retire, para estar seguros de que no hay alguna reaccion adversa.<br>  <br>  Para mayor seguridad, debes acudir a una clinica de salud.<br>  <br>  Saludos y buena suerte.|`|5fa38884f2d4aee5c1a7d38f4c7321a6aa	Depende del área en que se desea aplicarla y por que vía.<br>  La hay vía muscular, subcutánea, intravenosa y la técnica varía dependiendo la vía y el área.|`|69edc2a46c317070754996ee9df6190caa	En las zonas suave, sere sincero para prender tienes que ver, ve a un hospital y preguntale a una emfermera para que veas paso a paso|`|6ed333e8d22cd67ab55281f27b52f3e7aa	1.

Dfr6uA91aa	Either way, they're not too different. In fact, the TI-83+ and TI-84+ are so similar, that every program made for the TI-83+ can be run on the TI-84+.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, I'd rather get the TI-84+. Why? It's faster, has bigger memory, more apps, has a built-in clock, has a USB port (which makes transferring programs much easier), among other things. The TI-84+ seems to currently be one of the top ranking Texas Instruments calculators, with TI-83+ following closely behind.<br>  <br>  In the end, it's all up to you.

HTmj2BXDaa	There would be no concussion because, in the vacuum of space, there are very few atoms around to transmit the physical force of the explosion.  There would be an intense flash of radiation and the atoms of the bomb itself would be accelerated very rapidly away from the explosion.  On earth, a nuclear bomb creates such an intense flash of radiation that anything flamable that is near by is heated to the ignition point and it bursts into flame (if there is oxygen around).  Even without the oxygen, the air immediately around the explosion is heated to incredibly high temperatures and that creates a pressure wave (the concusion).  The radiation from the bomb travels at the speed of light but the concussion travels more slowly.|`|W6jpGOPiaa	The sun is in space and its on fire. <br>  the nuclear reaction would be the same and it would blow up.

22vd3xXDaa	Really good question...<br>  <br>  "Now, to address hand sanitizers and sperm in general. Many hand sanitizers have alcohol (ethanol) as their active ingredient. When you put these hand sanitizers on your skin, they dry out the surrounding area and bacteria on your skin die from dehydration. You’ve probably noticed that these hand sanitizers evaporate very quickly and leave your skin feeling dry. Alcohol-dependent hand sanitizers typically also contain the toxic substance methanol, so that minors who buy hand sanitizers will not drink them. Alcohol hand sanitizers do not harm your skin, because the top skin layer of the skin is already dead. Now, the combination of dehydration and toxic methanol might kill some sperm cells, but it is probably ineffective as a spermicide. Keep in mind that a wet vagina will restore water to the sperm cells and that even reduced amounts of sperm from ejaculate can cause a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Some hand sanitizers are “antibacterial” or “antiseptic”. This usually means that they attack bacteria cells specifically. A commonly used antibacterial soap and hand sanitizer agent is called triclosan. Almost all antiseptic chemicals inhibit growth that is specific and necessary to bacteria, so that humans are not affected by the chemical. This is very important, or else every time we took antibacterial medication we would feel as though we were undergoing chemotherapy! If your sanitizer was of this form, no human cells were harmed, including sperm cells. (As an aside, the use of triclosan and other antibacterial agents is under debate)."|`|nqkXE1cUaa	YEs.|`|QykYW3R7aa	Absolutely. Sperm are pretty fragile little "soldiers" and can't survive for very long outside of the body.  Washing your hands would take care of it, but if you want to use hand sanitizer to feel better, then by all means, rub away (no pun intended).

If so, I'll continue guessing that the "x" you are looking for is the size of the angle PNM.  That's the part left over within the corner at N after removing the 42o.  Since MNOP is a rectangle all its corners are right angles, 90o.

4fWZL4TRaa	Glue logic is used to connect between two devices, so it is creating the correct states and logic levels for the interface. An example would be to interface a microprocessor to an analogue to digital converter, there may need to be address lines, enables, read and write lines, clocks, control lines, reset lines, interrupt lines. Such signals may need gating with other system signals, latching, inverting etc to condition them correctly for the interface. Glue logic can be made from individual logic devices, dedicated IC's (look up Cypress for a manufacturer), or programmable logic devices.<br>  <br>  Reconfigurable logic uses a programmable logic array. These devices are often used as glue logic, typically for memory decoding to drive peripheral devices, but can be used for general logic designs, such as state machines, clocked logic, boolean logic, sequencers, specialised processors.<br>  <br>  There are a number of logic functions on a single programmable device, which can be interconnected by programmable connections during the programming process. Sometimes an EPROM can be used as a programmable logic device, as it provides a table of outputs depending on the input address code and the programming.<br>  <br>  There are many types of programmable logic, perhaps GAL/PAL and FPGA are the best known families. What you use depends on functions, complexity, size, price, speed, power consumption. A well known PAL available in many variations is the 22V10.<br>  <br>  The two links below have short discussions on the two methods.

O1PpybX0aa	Chlorine dioxide is a highly endothermic compound that can decompose extremely violently when separated from diluting substances. As a result preparation methods that involve producing solutions of it without going through a gas phase stage are often preferred.<br>  <br>  In the laboratory, ClO2 is prepared by oxidation of sodium chlorite:[3]<br>  <br>  2NaClO2 + Cl2 → 2ClO2 + 2 NaCl <br>  Over 95% of the chlorine dioxide produced in the world today is made from sodium chlorate and is used for pulp bleaching. It is produced with high efficiency by reducing sodium chlorate in a strong acid solution with a suitable reducing agent such as hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide. The reaction of sodium chlorate with hydrochloric acid proceeds in one reactor via the following pathway:<br>  <br>  HClO3 + HCl → HClO2 + HOCl <br>  HClO3 + HClO2 → 2ClO2 + Cl2 + 2H2O <br>  HOCl + HCl → Cl2 + H2O <br>  A much smaller but important market for chlorine dioxide is for use as a disinfectant. Since 1999 a growing proportion of the chlorine dioxide made globally for water treatment and other small scale applications has been made using the chlorate, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid method which can produce a chlorine free product at high efficiency. Traditionally, chlorine dioxide for disinfection applications has been made by one of three methods using sodium chlorite or the sodium chlorite - hypochlorite method:<br>  <br>  2NaClO2 + 2HCl + NaOCl → 2ClO2 + 3NaCl + H2O <br>  or the sodium chlorite - hydrochloric acid method:<br>  <br>  5NaClO2 + 4HCl → 5NaCl + 4ClO2 + 2H2O <br>  All three sodium chlorite chemistries can produce chlorine dioxide with high chlorite conversion yield, but unlike the other processes the chlorite-HCl method produces completely chlorine free chlorine dioxide but suffers from the requirement of 25% more chlorite to produce an equivalent amount of chlorine dioxide.<br>  <br>  Very pure chlorine dioxide can also be produced by electrolysis of a chlorite solution:<br>  <br>  2NaClO2 + 2H2O   →   2ClO2 + 2NaOH + H2

Einstein donated the original 46-page manuscript to The Hebrew University on the occasion of its opening in 1925. It is arguably the most valuable Einstein manuscript in existence.<br>  Einstein completed the general theory of relativity in 1915 and published this first exposé the following year. The general theory overturned Newton's theory of gravity which had been valid for two hundred and fifty years. In Newton's universe, gravity was regarded as an attractive force which all massive bodies exert on each other. The planets moved in elliptical orbits about the sun because of its great mass powerful gravitational force. In Einstein's universe, gravity is not regarded as an exterior force, but rather as a property of space and time or "spacetime". Einstein's curved four-dimensional spacetime "continuum" is often likened to a suspended rubber sheet stretched taut but deformed wherever heavy objects - stars, galaxies or any other matter - are placed on it. Thus, a massive body like the sun curves the spacetime around it and the planets move along these curved pathways of spacetime. As Einstein put it: "matter tells space how to bend; space tells matter how to move".<br>  The general theory predicted exactly to what extent a light beam would be bent when it passes near the sun. This prediction was confirmed by observations made by an expedition led by the British astronomer Arthur Eddington during a total eclipse of the sun in May 1919. It was the announcement of the confirmation of this prediction which thrust celebrity status upon Einstein overnight in November 1919.|`|W6jpGOPiaa	i used it to roll a doobie.

rH6dNsR7aa	This is actually an interesting question with several implications. <br>  <br>  The first notable thing to consider is that as humans, we can only taste the things hat we have receptors for. Based on genetic recombination, a portion of the population are unable to taste litmus paper, while the majority of the population can (I've heard it's quite bitter). If we have no proteins capable of forming a complex with any of the molecules in saliva, we'd be unable to taste it ever.<br>  <br>  Second, You're right in assuming that our bodies adapt to stimulation. More specifically, when a sensory nerve fires (be it from your eye, nose, mouth, or fingertip), it releases an electrical charge, in the form of ions, down the axon. When the axon reaches another nerve cell, it releases a neurotransmitter into the synapse, causing the stimulus to continue. When a cell uses up this transmitter, however, it becomes incapable (or at least weakens) and is unable to stimulate further response until some more neurotransmitter has been manufactured. <br>  <br>  If our bodies were constantly using this neurotransmitter to tell us that we tasted our own saliva, day in and day out, it wouldn't leave much to allow us to taste things that really mattered. Our bodies have therefore likely developed an insensitivity to such needless stimulation.|`|AA10803058	probably, however technically spit has a pH that is somewhat basic, so it does have a taste that is not very acid like

22vd3xXDaa	The active ingredient in Prep-H is an adrenergic drug known as phenylephrine.  Through a variety of complex pathways, these drugs cause vasoconstriction (reduced blood flow) at the application site, which effectively reduces the discomfort of hemorrhoids.  They can also result in a slight increase in blood pressure through the body.  Antidepressants (and more specifically, tricyclic antidepressants), can potentiate this effect (make it stronger), thus further increasing systemic blood pressure.<br>  <br>  They put the info on the box, so that if you already have high blood pressure AND take a TCA, you should take note and check with your doctor.

AA10145618	Currently, petroleum is one of the cheapest and most portable forms of energy available. Without petroleum the worlds current level of technology would probably not exist. The world would simply not sustain the current level of population without the benefits that this source of energy has provided. <br>  <br>  Early in the development of the petroleum industry, petroleum became a substitute for whale oil. Without the discovery of petroleum and its subsequent distillation to make kerosene, whales would be extinct. They were almost hunted to extinction in the 1800's. Petroleum then changed the agriculture industry, making it possible for the agricultural revolution that improved the efficiency of farms, making it possible for a few workers to farm hundreds, and now thousands of acres of land. Before petroleum, agriculture relied on animals for power, to pull plows, wagons, grind grain, and clear land. While steam engines had been utilized initially to replace animals, the development of gasoline and diesel engines made it possible for many more farmers to economically change to tractors. <br>  <br>  Today, you could not be reading this on your computer without petroleum. Your monitor screen is very likely made from petroleum. The case of your computer is made from petroleum, the substrate in your computer chips, and the insulation on your computers wiring are all made from petroleum. The modern electronics industry owes its very existence to the availability of petroleum. <br>  <br>  If you look around your house, you will find the carpet on your floor and the padding underneath it are made from petroleum. Most likely your other floor coverings are made from petroleum. Your roof is likely made from petroleum. Your clothing may be made from petroleum, and if not, was grown on a farm powered by petroleum. Your roads and tires are made from petroleum. Your shampoo and detergent are made from petroleum. <br>  <br>  During World War 2, the main advantage the Allies had over Nazi Germany was the supply of oil from Texas. At that time the US was the world's major exporter of oil and US oil production fueled the Allied Armies and Navies in the European and Pacific theaters. When both the Germans and the Japanese ran out of oil supplies they discovered they could no longer keep their military running and they lost the war. Without oil you would likely be speaking German or possibly Japanese and very likely living in a very different world. <br>  <br>  Man would have very likely never have made it to space, much less land on the Moon or put robots on Mars. Robert Goddard's first rocket used gasoline as fuel. Today the Saturn V, Atlas V, Falcon 1, and Falcon 9 rockets, as well as most Russian and Chinese rockets use petroleum based fuel. <br>  <br>  Your life would be very much worse without it.|`|is4hA8eUaa	In agriculture, petro chemicals are responsible for higher yield crops, thus we're using less land to grow the same amount of fruit/veggies.

C0Jf2m9Waa	1 An observation: organisms in general produce more offspring than there are parents. So the population of every species has a tendency to increase. <br>  <br>  2 Another observation: in practice, populations remain at more or less the same size. There are fluctuations, which are considerable in some species, but behind all this "noise" the "signal" is a constant population size. <br>  <br>  3 A deduction from 1 and 2: there is competition (for survival) between individuals of a species. <br>  <br>  4 One more observation: among individuals of a species there is variation (= variability). They are not all alike. Although Darwin and Wallace did not know details of genetics, this variation is caused partly by genetic and partly by environmental factors. The modern theory says that it is the genetic variation that matters. <br>  <br>  5 A final deduction: it is the individuals that are best adapted to their environment that are most likely to survive and reproduce.

368407779143c4323ffd3fb0244979b0aa	Hola amigo! coincidio tambien, sobre la primera respuesta!<br>  Es muy completa, lamentablemente la informacion es <br>  sobre HIPER-TIROIDISMO!<br>  <br>  Y esta Pregunta es sobre el HIPO-PARATIROIDISMO.<br>  <br>  espero me aclares si se trata de hipo-paratiroidismo <br>  o de hipo-tiroidismo!<br>  <br>  de cualquier forma te dejare informacion de ambas comenzando con el hipotiroidismo que es el mas comun.<br>  <br>  Hay mucha diferencia en los cambios hormonales en el cuerpo, <br>  en sintomas son parecidos<br>  para comenzar tendriamos que ir primero a terminologia medica.<br>  HIPER=MUCHO, RAPIDO,==== HIPO=LENTO, POCO. <br>  <br>  o sea a diferencia del hipertiroidismo, en el hipotiroidismo. <br>  hay una produccion menor de hormona tiroidea que es segregada precisamente por la glandula tiroides.<br>  que a su vez esta manipulada en su raiz por la glandula hipofisis, <br>  esta glandula determina el tipo de metabolismo que tendremos. <br>  <br>  por eso veran a gente que come muchisimo y no engorda por nada o por lo contrario! quien de ver la comida ya engorda!<br>  esto esta regido desde el nacimiento por la glandula hipofisis, y quien administra esto por medio de la hormona tiroidea es la glandula tiroides.<br>  <br>  claro no por que alguien este gordito o muy flaco quiere decir que tenga problemas de la glandula tiroides. <br>  <br>  Cuando hay problemas de hipotiroidismo, es cuando los niveles de hormona tiroidea son muy bajos, no hay una cantidad exacta cada persona con hipotiroidismo puede tener niveles distintos, por eso dentro de el medicamento para el hipotiroidismo (levotiroxina) varian las dosis. <br>  <br>  y los sintomas son aumento de peso considerable! en seguida se nota el aumento de peso, a pesar de que se lleve una dieta! aun una baja en carbohidratos, aun con anorexia! o sea no comiendo! se sigue aumentando de peso, <br>  suele haber dolores de cabeza, bocio( inflamacion de la glandula tiroides) y esta es muy facil de localizar ya que es lo que normalmente conocemos como la manzana de adan, en el cuello. <br>  <br>  piel manchada, estrenimiento, gases, mal aliento, y solo en pocos casos se ve afectado el sistema nervioso, algo que si pasa mucho en casos de hipertiroidismo! donde se pierde peso exagerado! aun que se coma en excesso y ahi si se ve afectado el sistema nervioso creando estados de ansiedad generalizada con ataques de panico y depresion, ademas de que en el hipertiroidismo, el exceso de esta hormona en caso de no tratarse puede matar tejido del corazon creando la muerte de no tratarse.<br>  <br>  pero en el hipotiroidismo esto no es tan grave, ya que en el hipertiroidismo muchas veces a base de yodo y otros quimicos con radiacion se tiene que destruir la glandula y crear a proposito un hipotiroidismo para evitar danos irreversibles.<br>  <br>  si notas que a pesar de estar en dieta de casi no comer, de tomar bastante agua, de hacer ejercicio y tomar vitaminas, sigues aumentando de peso, teniendo cansancio exagerado, dolores de cabeza y tu piel no luce como debiera. <br>  entonces es muy posible que haya  un hipotiroidismo. <br>  <br>  Para lo cual se hace un estudio en la sangre para revisar los niveles de esta hormona.<br>  <br>  en caso de encontrarse un hipotiroidismo, se puede tratar, pero lo mas seguro es administrar levotiroxina, la cual tu medico dependiendo de tu disminucion de la hormona te indicara la dosis. <br>  <br>  Esta pastilla generalmente se toma de por vida, es una al dia, no tiene efectos secundarios notorios, es como tomarte una dulce, y en cuestion de semanas de tomar la pastilla desaparece el bocio( inflamacion del cuello o tiroides) y regresas a tu peso normal. <br>  al que regularmente has tenido...<br>  <br>  pero no dejes de ir con tu medico. <br>  <br>  Espero que te hayas querido referir al HIPOTIROIDISMO. <br>  YA QUE POR COMO LO ESCRIBISTE DICE OTRA COSA. <br>  Y EN EFECTO TAMBIEN TENEMOS GLANDULAS <br>  "PARATIROIDES" se encuentran en la parte posterior de la glandula tiroides, y esta tiene otra funcion basica tambien en el cuerpo que es el regulamiento de la el calcio y fosforo en la sangre! aunque terminan con tiroides no son lo mismo!<br>  <br>  La hormona paratiroidea (HPT) regula la cantidad de calcio y fosforo en la sangre y los huesos esta hormona es producida por cuatro glandulas mas pequenas que la tiroides y se localizan precisamente detras de la glandula tiroides<br>  <br>  El hipoparatiroidismo es la enfermedad ocasionada por la falta de hormona paratiroidea. Los niveles de calcio en la sangre disminuyen y los de fosforo aumentan. Los bajos niveles de calcio en la sangre pueden ocasionar sintomas como Hormigueo de labios, manos y pies, Calambres musculares, Dolor en la cara, piernas y pies, Dolor abdominal, Cabello reseco, U?as quebradizas, Piel seca y escamosa, Cataratas, Esmalte de los dientes debilitado en los ni?os, Espasmos musculares llamados tetania que puede conducir a espasmos de la laringe, causando dificultad para respirar,  Convulsiones (ataques)<br>  <br>  en ocaciones la disminucion de la hormona paratiroidea es causada por la disminucion de magnesio en la sangre y aumento del pH a esto se le llama alcalosis metabolica.<br>  <br>  Los factores de riesgo para el hipoparatiroidismo incluyen operacion reciente de la glandula tiroides o alguna parte del cuello , antecedentes familiares de trastornos de paratiroides o antecedentes de ciertos trastornos endocrinos autoinmunes tales como la enfermedad de Addison<br>  <br>  y bueno ya hise esto muy largo!! yo no padezco de esto pero ya tengo hormigueo en los dedos! <br>  cualquier duda dejame saber y con gusto te oriento|`|b13c1bfaa159c6651c5930d873dc7efeaa	La hormona tiroidea generalmente controla el ritmo de todos los procesos en el cuerpo. Este ritmo se conoce como su metabolismo. Si existe demasiada hormona tiroidea, toda función del cuerpo tiende a acelerarse. Por lo tanto, no es de sorprender que los síntomas de hipertiroidismo sean nerviosismo, irritabilidad, aumento de la sudoración, palpitaciones, temblor de las manos, ansiedad, dificultad para dormir, adelgazamiento de la piel, cabello fino y quebradizo, y debilidad muscular – especialmente en los brazos y muslos. Usted podrá tener defecación más frecuente, pero la diarrea es poco común. Puede perder peso a pesar de tener un buen apetito y, en el caso de las mujeres, el flujo menstrual puede hacerse más ligero y los periodos menstruales ocurrir con menos frecuencia.<br>  <br>  El hipertiroidismo generalmente comienza lentamente. Al principio los síntomas pueden confundirse con el simple nerviosismo debido al estrés. Si usted ha estado tratando de perder peso por medio de dietas, puede sentirse complacido con los resultados hasta que el hipertiroidismo, que ha acelerado la pérdida de peso, ocasione otros problemas.<br>  <br>  En la enfermedad de Graves, que es la forma más común de hipertiroidismo, los ojos pueden verse grandes porque los párpados superiores están levantados. A veces, uno o ambos ojos pueden protruir. Algunos pacientes tienen inflamación en la parte anterior del cuello debido a un agrandamiento de la glándula tiroides (bocio).<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Cómo se trata el hipertiroidismo?  No existe un tratamiento único que sea el mejor para todos los pacientes con hipertiroidismo. El tratamiento que su médico seleccionará depende de su edad, el tipo de hipertiroidismo que usted tiene, la severidad de su hipertiroidismo y otras condiciones médicas que puedan afectar su salud. Sería una buena idea consultar con un médico que tenga experiencia en el tratamiento de pacientes hipertiroideos. Si usted no tiene bien aclarado o no está convencido acerca del plan de tratamiento, es buena idea buscar una segunda opinión.<br>  <br>  Drogas antitiroideas. Drogas conocidas como agentes antitiroideos- metimazol (Tapazol?) o propiltiouracilo (PTU) – pueden ser recetadas si su médico decide tratar el hipertiroidismo obstruyendo la capacidad de la glándula tiroides de producir hormona tiroidea. Estas drogas funcionan bien para controlar la glándula hiperactiva, controlar el hipertiroidismo rápidamente sin causar da?o permanente a la glándula tiroides. En un 20-30% de pacientes con enfermedad de Graves, el tratamiento con drogas antitiroideas por un período de 12 a 18 meses resultará en una remisión prolongada de la enfermedad. Para los pacientes con bocio tóxico nodular o multinodular, las drogas antitiroideas se usan como preparación ya sea para tratamiento con yodo radiactivo o cirugía.<br>  <br>  Las drogas antitiroideas causan reacciones alérgicas en aproximadamente un 5% de los pacientes que las toman. Reacciones menores frecuentes son erupciones rojizas de la piel, picazón en la piel y ocasionalmente fiebre y dolor de las articulaciones. Un efecto colateral más raro (ocurre en 1 de cada 500 pacientes) pero más serio es una disminución en el número de glóbulos blancos. Esto puede disminuir su resistencia a las infecciones. Muy raramente estos glóbulos blancos pueden desaparecer por completo, produciendo una condición conocida como agranulocitosis, un problema potencialmente fatal si sobreviene una infección seria. Si usted está tomando una de estas drogas y adquiere una infección tal como fiebre o dolor de garganta, usted debe dejar de tomar la droga de inmediato y hacer un recuento de glóbulos blancos ese mismo día. Aun si la droga ha reducido su recuento de glóbulos blancos, este se normalizará si la droga se suspende de inmediato. Pero si usted continúa tomando una de estas drogas a pesar de la disminución de los glóbulos blancos, existe el riesgo de una infección más seria que puede poner en peligro su vida. El da?o al hígado es otro efecto colateral muy raro. Usted debe dejar de tomar el medicamento y comunicarse con su médico si desarrolla un color amarillo de los ojos, orina oscura, fatiga severa o dolor abdominal.<br>  <br>  Yodo radiactivo<br>  Otra manera de tratar el hipertiroidismo es da?ando o destruyendo las células tiroideas que producen hormona tiroidea. Como estas células necesitan yodo para producir hormona tiroidea, ellas captarán cualquier forma de yodo que esté en la sangre, sea este radiactivo o no. El yodo radiactivo utilizado en este tratamiento se administra via oral, usualmente en forma de una cápsula peque?a que se toma una sola vez. Una vez que se traga, el yodo radiactivo penetra en la corriente sanguínea y es captado rápidamente por las células tiroideas hiperactivas. El yodo radiactivo que no es captado por las células tiroideas desaparece del cuerpo en cuestión de días. Es eliminado en la orina o transformado por descomposición en un estado no radiactivo. En un período de varias semanas a varios meses (durante el cual se puede utilizar tratamiento con drogas para controlar los síntomas) el yodo radiactivo da?a las células que lo han captado. Como resultado la tiroides o los nódulos tiroideos se reducen de tama?o, y el nivel de hormona tiroidea en la sangre vuelve a lo normal. A veces, los pacientes seguirán teniendo hipertiroidismo, pero generalmente menos severo que antes. Para estos pacientes, se puede utilizar un segundo tratamiento si es necesario. Más frecuentemente, después de unos pocos meses sobrevendrá el hipotiroidismo (una glándula hipo-activa). De hecho, la mayoría de los pacientes que son tratados con yodo radiactivo desarrollarán hipotiroidismo después de un periodo de meses a a?os. El hipotiroidismo puede ser tratado fácilmente con un suplemento de hormona tiroidea que se toma una vez al día (Véase el folleto de Hipotiroidismo).<br>  <br>  El yodo radiactivo se ha utilizado para tratar pacientes con hipertiroidismo por más de 60 a?os. Debido a la preocupación de que el yodo radiactivo pudiera de alguna manera da?ar otras células del cuerpo, producir cáncer o tener otros efectos a largo plazo no deseados tales como infertilidad o defectos de nacimiento, los primeros médicos que utilizaron el yodo radiactivo tuvieron mucho cuidado de tratar sólo pacientes adultos y de observarlos cuidadosamente por el resto de sus vidas. Afortunadamente, ninguna complicación del tratamiento con yodo radiactivo ha sido aparente después de muchas décadas de cuidadoso seguimiento de los pacientes. Como consecuencia, en los Estados Unidos, más del 70% de los adultos que desarrollan hipertiroidismo son tratados con yodo radiactivo. Cada vez más ni?os están siendo también tratados con yodo radiactivo.<br>  <br>  Cirugía<br>  Su hipertiroidismo puede ser curado en forma permanente removiendo quirúrgicamente la mayor parte de su glándula tiroides. Este procedimiento es mejor que lo realice un cirujano con suficiente experiencia en cirugía de tiroides. La operación puede ser riesgosa a menos que su hipertiroidismo haya sido primero controlado por una droga antitiroidea (véase mas arriba) o una droga beta-bloqueante (véase más adelante). Usualmente, durante unos días antes de la cirugía, su cirujano puede indicarle tomar unas gotas de yodo no radiactivo – bien sea yodo Lugol o yoduro de potasio sobresaturado (SSKI). Este yodo adicional reduce el suministro de sangre a la glándula tiroides haciendo la cirugía más fácil y más segura. Aunque cualquier cirugía conlleva riesgos, complicaciones importantes de la cirugía de tiroides ocurren en menos del 1% de los pacientes operados por un cirujano con experiencia. Estas complicaciones incluyen da?o a las glándulas paratiroides que rodean a la tiroides y controlan sus niveles de calcio en el cuerpo (ocasionando problemas con niveles de calcio bajos) y da?o a los nervios que controlan las cuerdas vocales (causando voz ronca).<br>  <br>  Después de que la glándula tiroides es extraída quirúrgicamente, la causa de su hipertiroidismo ha sido eliminada y probablemente usted desarrollará hipotiroidismo. Al igual que con el hipotiroidismo que ocurre después del tratamiento con yodo radiactivo, los niveles de hormona tiroidea en la sangre pueden normalizarse tomando una vez al día un suplemento de hormona tiroidea.<br>  <br>  Betabloqueantes.<br>  Sin importar cual de estos tres métodos de tratamiento usted reciba para su hipertiroidismo, su médico podrá prescribir una clase de medicamentos conocidos como agentes betabloqueantes, los cuales obstruyen la acción de la hormona tiroidea en el cuerpo. Generalmente estos medicamentos le harán sentir mejor en cuestión de horas, aun cuando ellos no cambian los altos niveles de hormona tiroidea en la sangre. Estas drogas pueden ser extremadamente útiles en reducir su frecuencia cardíaca, los temblores y el nerviosismo hasta que una de las otras formas de tratamiento haya tenido la oportunidad de ejercer su efecto. La primera de estas drogas que se desarrolló fue el propanolol (Inderal?). Algunos médicos hoy día prefieren usar drogas relacionadas con ésta, pero de más larga duración, tales como el atenolol (Tenormin?), metoprolol (Lopressor?), nadolol (Corgard?) e Inderal-LA? debido a que su dosificación de una a dos veces al día es más conveniente.<br>  <br>  Otros miembros de la familia a riesgo<br>  Debido a que el hipertiroidismo, especialmente la enfermedad de Graves, puede ocurrir en familias, el examen de otros miembros de su familia puede descubrir otros individuos con problemas de tiroides. <br>  <br>  El cortisol (o corticoides), son mediacmentos peligrosos si se toman largo tiempo, pueden producir diabetes y problemas óseos principalmente. No se deben de tomar sin receta médica y nunca excederse, ni dejar de tomarlos bruscamente.|`|958db137a1f85cfa6a7cdddf09d6ce7aaa	CUADRO CLíNICO<br>  El hipoparatiroidismo es el cuadro clínico o síndrome derivado de una disminución primaria en los efectos biológicos dependientes de la hormona paratiroidea (PTH), como consecuencia de una disminución en la producción y concentración sérica, o una resistencia a nivel de los órganos diana.<br>  Su presentación y clínica características derivan principalmente de la hipocalcemia.<br>  La sintomatología predominante dependerá, en consecuencia, del desarrollo agudo o crónico de la hipocalcemia y de la etiología de la enfermedad. En la hipocalcemia aguda predominan los síntomas de irritación neuromuscular, parestesias, fibrilación, signos de tetania como espasmo carpopedal, signos de Chvostek y Trousseau, laringoespasmo, broncoespasmo, dolor abdominal e hiperreflexia generalizada. En casos más graves podremos observar crisis convulsivas, alteraciones de la memoria, psicosis, alteraciones extrapiramidales y cambios electrocardiográficos. En la hipocalcemia crónica, característica del hipoparatiroidismo, pueden aparecer cataratas, edema de la papila y pseudotumor cerebral; trastornos eléctricos cardíacos como prolongación del intervalo QT y alteraciones de la onda T, e insuficiencia cardíaca resistente al tratamiento convencional. Igualmente, son características las calcificaciones extraesqueléticas, como depósitos periarticulares,  ondrocalcinosis y pseudogota, así como calcificaciones de los ganglios basales y otras estructuras intracraneales. También, alteraciones dentarias que oscilan desde defectos de dentición hasta ausencia de piezas dentarias, o anemia macrocítica por deficiencia de vitamina B12. La mayor parte de estos trastornos, excepto las calcificaciones, son reversibles con el tratamiento y corrección de la hipocalcemia.|`|1601f0cc6ff4c1c72756024f848dad52aa	no se puede agregar casi nada a la primera respuesta, felicitaciones al primero que contesto (se le debieron acalambrar los dedos!!)|`|17f7bd4c1fbb625578e0da5ca057ef53aa	hmmmmmmmmm|`|1c5cb9b321e16c88cbd57841b5d5abb2aa	En Hemograma:poliglubulia,seguro relativa,durante accesos.Leucocitosis pasajera,y en las crisis.Linfocitosis<br>  QUIMICA:hipocalcemia a expensas de Ca ionico.Uricemia elevada.La hormona PTH baja en suero.Existe menor absorción de glucosa a nivel intestinal

852297e72a348bfb9566b8ed51f8ca31aa	Que es la Geobiologia? <br>  <br>  De la propia palabra se puede obtener fácilmente la descripción de lo que es, Geo corresponde a Tierra, bio a vida y logía a ciencia, por lo tanto la geobiología sería la ciencia que estudia la correspondencia entre la tierra y la vida.<br>  Profundizando un poco más, sería la ciencia que estudia las energías de la tierra y su influencia en los seres vivos.<br>  Atendiendo al principio universal de los opuestos (Yin y Yang) la tierra es Yin con respecto a la energía del sol o del Cosmos, que sería Yang en comparación.<br>  Por lo tanto la energía de la Tierra varía en función de las variaciones del Sol o del Cosmos y eso tiene un efecto sobre nosotros.<br>  El lugar que elegimos para vivir, o para dormir influyen (positiva o negativamente dependiendo de la energía del lugar) en nuestro cuerpo y por lo tanto en nuestra mente, nuestras emociones, etc.<br>  Ya entre los pueblos antiguos, Imperio Romano, China, Egipto, Celtas, Los pueblos del desierto, etc; Existían personas encargadas de elegir el lugar en el que se edificaría una ciudad o vivienda.<br>  Los Romanos por ejemplo dejaban pastar el ganado durante unos meses, luego examinaban las vísceras de este y así veían si el lugar era adecuado para la vida.<br>  Los Chinos paseaban con unas varillas (Como las de un zahorí) buscando el lugar adecuado para sus necesidades.<br>  Eso mismo hacemos nosotros ahora, con los conocimientos de Radiestesia y los descubrimientos de Hartmann, Curry o Bovis; Se ha avanzado en la detección de lugares hostiles a la vida y en la neutralización de los mismos.<br>  De la Tierra recibimos energías vitales que forman, junto a las energías cósmicas, el marco en donde se desarrolla la vida. La energía que se localiza en la corteza terrestre proviene de la interacción de diferentes mecanismos energéticos: los inherentes a la propia Tierra (magnéticos, eléctricos, gravitacionales, etc.) y los cósmicos (solar, lunar, planetas, galaxias, etc.). Esta energía global puede intensificarse o debilitarse en determinados puntos o lugares, los cuales podemos considerar como lugares geopatógenos.<br>  Las radiaciones naturales habituales en una zona se modifican cuando en el subsuelo concurren distintos elementos, como son las corrientes de agua subterránea, fracturas geológicas, bolsas de aire, masas de minerales, cambios en la composición del terreno, etc. Todo ello se conoce como alteraciones telúricas o zonas geofísicas inestables. Las alteraciones más frecuentes y más preocupantes son las fracturas y las corrientes de agua subterránea. Las fallas o fracturas son quiebras producidas por rompimientos de los estratos y bóvedas que originan un hundimiento. Entre estas capas más permeables puede circular agua. Sobre estos lugares podemos encontrar -dependiendo de las características de la perturbación geofísica- no sólo variaciones del campo magnético, sino otras de distinta índole con respecto al ambiente geofísico circundante: variaciones de la electroconductividad del terreno, de los niveles de radiactividad, mayor ionización positiva, condensación de gas radón, modificaciones de la radiación de infrarrojos o de microondas entre otros fenómenos.<br>  El organismo reacciona contra la agresión a la que es sometido, liberando o inhibiendo una serie de sustancias bioquímicas endógenas (endorfinas, melatonina, etc.). En estos casos no se consigue liberar la tensión acumulada, incluso se agrega más. De ahí, que las personas que duermen sobre zonas alteradas se levanten cansadas por la ma?ana, con dolores de cabeza, sin ánimo, irritables, etc.<br>  La experiencia y los estudios realizados demuestran que las personas expuestas a estos lugares manifiestan una serie de perturbaciones en sus constantes fisiológicas: alteraciones de la presión sanguínea y del ritmo cardiaco y síntomas como insomnio, malestar general, dolores musculares, reúmas, asmas, vértigos, alergias, cambios de comportamiento (irritabilidad, nerviosismo, apatía, depresión) y otros trastornos o enfermedades que dependen de la intensidad de la alteración y de la capacidad de respuesta del organismo. Progresivamente, se va reduciendo la eficacia del sistema inmunológico y, por tanto, el organismo se sensibiliza al agente geopatógeno. Las consecuencias de la estancia en un lugar inestable socavan no sólo el estado físico, sino también el psíquico, con cambios en las pautas de comportamiento.<br>  Los fetos y bebés son más sensibles a la alteración de la radiación natural; estos últimos manifiestan su rechazo con llantos. Al estar situados en un lugar geofísico inestable, inmediatamente suelen demostrar inquietud, nerviosismo, comienzan los lloros o los estados febriles, síntomas aparentemente injustificados. Igualmente, al colocarles en un lugar neutro su recuperación es muy rápida, cuando no inmediata.<br>  <br>  ?En qué se basa la geobiología?<br>  La geobiología consiste en detectar las perturbaciones y las alteraciones terrestres que afectan el metabolismo de las personas y de los seres vivos en general. De esta manera podremos determinar los lugares que debemos evitar en los espacios que permanezcamos más tiempo como es el dormitorio o las zonas de trabajo. El desarrollo tecnológico y científico ha olvidado considerar muchos de los factores que son necesarios para disfrutar de una buena salud.<br>  <br>  ?En qué nos puede ayudar la geobiología?<br>  El conocimiento de las zonas y los elementos geopatógenas de los lugares en los que residimos es fundamental para nuestra salud. Con frecuencia ocurre que el estado físico de las personas puede mejorar cambiando de lugar sin que exista una razón evidente.<br>  Sin lugar a dudas conocer el buen lugar es muy importante para asegurar que no nos afecta ninguna energía terrestre negativa. Normalmente las llamadas "malas energías", com manifestaciones muy diversas, acostumbran a aparecer en zonas telúricamente alteradas.<br>  <br>  Origen e historia de la geobiología<br>  En la Grecia clásica Hipócrates, padre de la medicina, ya recomienda considerar las causas externas que influyen en la salud en su tratado Sobre los aires, las aguas y los lugares. También en la Antigua China se estudiaban las fuerzas y energías que emanaban de la Tierra.<br>  En general todos los pueblos y culturas de la antigüedad concedieron una gran importancia a la situación y orientación de los edificios y monumentos.|`|I6nopGJJaa	Geo-La Tierra, Bio-Vida, Logia-Tratado<br>  Una traduccion: Estudio de la Vida y la Tierra.|`|57319acfd7b514aae224769febf8a90caa	en wikipedia.org puedes encontrar más información.<br>  <br>  Esto es lo que tengo sobre el tema:<br>  <br>  La Geobiología y la Bioconstrucción - también llamadas "Medicinas del Hábitat" - estudian todas las interrelaciones, que a continuación exponemos, a fin de que los informes que se deriven de este estudio puedan servir para conocer la importancia del lugar sobre el que se está viviendo, y nos permitan realizar todas aquellas modificaciones necesarias para alcanzar una mayor calidad de vida y evitar, en la medida de lo posible, los factores de riesgo que están provocando la mayoría de las enfermedades actuales.<br>  GEOBIOLOGIA<br>  La Geobialogía es una ciencia que, recogiendo los conocimientos profundos de la sabiduría tradicional y uniendolos con las más recientes investigaciones científicas, centra su interés en el estudio de las relaciones entre los seres vivos - especialmente el hombre - y las energías que emanan de la tierra, las que provienen de las radiaciones cósmicas, y las generadas por la propia actividad humana. <br>  Todos los seres vivos están sujetos a un mar de radiaciones que nos ba?an constantemente, y de cuya energía depende nuestro equilibrio y nuestra salud física y mental. <br>  La Geobiología estudia las interacciones entre: radiaciones terrestres, campos magnéticos, radioactividad, contaminación eléctrica o electromagnética artificial; su influencia en la salud y su relaci6n con las enfermedades padecidas por personas, plantas y animales.<br>  Entre las radiaciones que estudia la Geobiología, consideramos interesantes detallar las siguentes:<br>  Campos : Eléctricos y Radiaciones Electromagnéticas: <br>  Pueden ser tanto de origen natural - radiación cósmica, solar, magnetismo terrestre, etc.- como artificiales - líneas de alta tensión, transformadores, electrodomestícos etc. <br>  Estas últimas son las más preocupantes, ya que afectan el sistema inmunológico llegando a ser causa de transtomos mutágenos. Además estas radiaciones inciden directamnete sobre el sistema nervioso central, al ser perci bidas como un incesante bombardeo que perturbá nuestras neuronas, induciendo estados de stress, insomnio, jaquecas, depresiones...<br>  Radiaciones Cósmicas:<br>  Provienen del espacio Interestelar, y se componen de ondas radioeléctricas, rayos X, microondas, rayos infrarrojos, luz visible, radiaciones ultravioletas... Ha sido constatada la relación entre la variación de la actividad solar (manchas solares) y ciertos fenómenos terrestres, como las tempestades magnéticas, pertubaciones de la .iosfera, variaciones del campo magnético terrestre, etc,En particular, la relación entre este último y la glándula pineal, cuya alteración puede provocar perturbaciones, en el sistema neuroendocrino.<br>  Radiaciones Terrestres:<br>  Energías procedentes del subsuelo, como consecuencia de la descomposición de materiales radiactivos de la corteza terrestre, que emiten hacia la atmósfera radiaciones gamma, partículas radiactivas, radiación infrarroja, o gases radiactivos como el gas radón, este gas, que se acumula sobre todo en viviendas poco ventiladas, genera trastornos respiratorios que pueden desembocar en cáncer de pulmón. La influencia de estas radiaciones telúriras es más intensa en la vertical de fisuras, fallas geológicas, venas de agua subterranea, capas freáticas corrientes telúricas y de las redes geomagnéticas terrestres (red Hartman, Curry ...). En los estudios geobiológicos se constata una fuerte incidencia de estas anomalías terrestres en trastornos del sistema circulatorio, estando relacionadas con enfermedades cardiovasculares y degenerativas.<br>  BIOCONSTRUCCIóN:<br>  Aborda amplios aspectos del hábitat : desde el exhaustivo examen del terreno a edificar con un estudio Geobiológico, hasta la correcta elección de los materiales, pinturas ecológicas, instalación eléctrica, bloclimática, ahorro energético racionalización del espacio, energías renovables, etc, evitanto todos aquellos materiales que presenten tóxicidad, sean radiactivos o revistan cierta peligrosidad para los moradores, en un intento de a?adir a los aspectos técnicos y de calidad el de un confort biológico y salubridad.<br>  La Asociación de EstudiosGeobiológicos GEA nace con el objetivo de aunar esfuerzos y actividades que de forma individual se venían realizando en todo el territorio nacional, promoviendo y facilitando el estudio de estas ciencias "nuevas" en nuestro pais, así como el resto de materias afines relacionadas con ellas: Biología, Física, Geología, Arquitectura, Medio Ambiente, etc.<br>  Fruto de esta labor conjunta aparece el boletín trimestral "GEA", en el que se recogen los diferentes estudios, investigaciones, proyectos... tanto individuales como colectivos, sirviendo como nexo de unión entre todos los interesados en Geobiología y Bioconstrucción.

And probably some wire, too.<br>  <br>  Then with something like a propelor, and some containers for that water, you could use the motor as an inefficient electric generator, and use the wires to send the power to the light bulb.<br>  <br>  but without any of these things; with just water and a motor,<br>  you're best bet is breaking the motor with your bare hands (good luck) and rubbing parts of it together fast enough to create enough heat to make the metal glow.

If the dipstick reaction for glucose is positive, a confirmatory test is needed.  The copper reduction test (called the "clinitest") is a nonspecific test for urine sugars based on the abillity of sugars to reduce copper sulfate to cuprous oxide.  This confirmatory test is positive for all sugars but it isn't as sensitive as the dipstick at detecting very small concentrations of glucose.  <br>  <br>  Ketones are measured by the dipstick by the "sodium nitroprusside reaction" in which acetoacetic acid reacts with sodium nitroprusside to form a purple color.  This reaction measures ketone which are by-products of fat metabolism that accumulate in diabetic patients.

The other end of all the LEDs come together to one end of the switch, and the other end of the switch goes back to the other terminal of the batteries.  Make sure the LEDs are all the same way (+ and - ends together).  If in doubt, connect one LED to the batteries to see which way it lights.

I think nearly everyone knows by now that there are no higher life forms on Mars.  The aliens being reported, and the concept in popular culture, are as I described them.  They are reported as traveling in flying discs or in boomerang or triangular shaped craft.  I have seen or heard no reports involving ray guns.  This is also from books and movies.

6489542faea6397e4bd4ddb95f4fc744aa	like this: the ball has energy as it is falling to the ground. when it hits the ground, it should transfer its energy to the ground and the ground should move, but since the energy of the ball is not great enough to move the mass of the earth, it is transfered back to the ball. depending on the elasticity of the ball it will react differently (rubber bounces more, a baseball will create more sound and less bounce), but the energy transfered is still the same amount.|`|bQQ5mX6oaa	the ground pushing against the ball helps the ball to bounce- so the the elasticity of the ball itself|`|ynQYm087aa	Absolutely. The ball has some sort of internal elasticity. That means that it wants to remain spherical, and any deformation is resisted by a restoring force. When you drop a ball, the force is equal to F=ma=m(dv/dt)=dp/dt, where p is momentum. So the change in momentum over the change in time is the force that the ball exerts on the ground. The ground must exert the same force (if it didn't, the ball would pass right through it, since nothing is stopping it from doing so). If a ball bounces completely (not physical, but the ideal case), then the change in momentum is 2mv, where v is the velocity of the ball. v can be found by equating energies: mgh=1/2mv^2, so v=sqrt(2gh). p=2mv because the ball has mv to start with, goes to zero when it hits the ground and stops, and then goes back with the same velocity (again, ideal case). So the change in total is 2mv. If this happens in, say, 1 millisecond, then the force exerted on the ground is<br>  <br>  F=dp/dt=2mv/(1*10^-3 sec), where m is the mass, and v=sqrt(2gh). Check with your intuition that this is true. does the force get bigger when the height, h, is larger? It sure does.|`|5MN51yg2aa	Yes and no. Things bounce because of the transfer of momentum. I a ball hits a wall its momentum is transferred to it. The wall then transfers its momentum to the ball and it goes up. Newtons 3 Law explains it, but its not the best example.

(Oros).<br>  Quindi oroscopo vuol dire ascendente.<br>  Per calcolarlo, sapendo l'ora ed il luogo di nascita,. è una sciocchezza. Però devi, prima di imbarcarti in calcoli, fare una considerazione importante:<br>  Se tu prendi qualsiasi tavola di effemeridi odierne, ti parla delle COSTELLAZIONI.<br>  Causa la precessione degli equinozi, scoperta da Ipparco di Nicea nel 110 a.C. queste ormai non coincidono piu con i segni zodiacali.

It runs our of food, the environment no longer supports the life of yeast (too hot or cold, for example), or  the yeast pollutes itself to death (the "waste of yeast is CO2 and alcohol - if either of those get to be too much of a percentage of the environment, then the yeast will die.)<br>  <br>  It is a good question about the environment, but I doubt the person who asked it wants to think about that.

The title Heru (Heracles) was bestowed upon men and women who displayed qualities of behavior that promoted truth and nobility.  The criteria and process for electing an individual as a living Heru or Hercules was later copied by Europeans."

First of all, if 7 of each was given away, then there are 7 items left;    28-3(7) = 7.  Also, since you gave 7 of each, then 7($3) + 7($4) + 7($5) = $84 was given away and now $108-$84 = $24 is left over.  Now it gets a bit tricky.  You have to do some trial and error because you don't know which of the 2 you have left.  However, no matter how many caps you choose between 1 and 7, you can never get $24 and add up to 7 with one more item.  So, you must have ran out of caps.  Therefore, you have two equations: # Balloons + # Candy = 7 and $3*balloons + $4*candy = $24, and the only combination that works is 4 additional balloons and 3 candy, so the final answer is : 7 caps, 11 balloons, and 10 bags of candy.|`|Ix4bLc16aa	7 caps<br>  10 bags of candy<br>  11 balloons
0b8c05aa668d756e4b0d475ea50c27adaa	The laws apply to all systems that involve energy and energy transformations. Respiration and photosynthesis fall in this category.  So in photosynthesis, the plant does not make energy but just transforms light energy into food energy (convervation law 1 ).  During the process, not all of the energy is converted, since most of it is lost as heat (transformation law 2).  To keep the system going, it needs a regular stream of energy (entropy, law 3).  I hope you get the drift. Respiration also involves energy conversions .|`|515520c752f4133ee59ea7409ab8e61caa	cellular respiration and photosynthesis use up energy. since they cannot create or destroy energy but can change it to different form , then the first law apply. let look at the second law.. whenever there is a change in energy form it is not 100% efficient some are lost usually as heat. also applies to cellular respiration and photosynthesis.|`|sljgcoIJaa	Conservation of energy (1st law - energy is neither created nor destroyed) is the whole basis of both processes. Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) which are then used to store chemical energy in the bonds of glucose/glucose-type molecules made from Carbon Dioxide. In cellular respiration, the chemical energy in the bonds holding glucose molecules together is converted to chemical energy (ATP, which is used to run various other processes) and thermal energy (heat). The heat aspect is the second law of thermodynamics (there's no such thing as a free lunch, as my Dad used to say). In any conversion of energy, some energy is lost to heat. We "warm blooded" animals are grateful for that, as the heat lost from cellular respiration is what keeps us warm. That doesn't mean that only "warm-blooded" critters carry out cellular respiration, but that we carry it out on a much larger scale than other critters, because we rely on the heat that is produced. "Cold-blooded" critters (the ones that intentionally absorb heat from their environment as needed) don't carry out cellular respiration at as rapid a rate - which is why they don't need to eat as often, or breathe as often (if they breathe at all - some simpy rely on diffusion of oxygen).|`|s0Vk646Kaa	Grasshopper, the First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy is never created or destroyed just changed, this is the Law of Conservation (I think.)<br>  <br>  The second law is that with every change or chemical reaction some energy is 'lost' to entrophy(unorganized energy). this usually occurs as heat.<br>  <br>  These laws relate to Cellular respiration and Photosynthesis because these systems . . .<br>  <br>  A) Do not create their own energy.{They either turn sunlight into chemical energy or eat the products <organic compounds> of those that do.}<br>  <br>  B) Lose some of the energy they get as heat or entrophy.

Hyperventilate away enough carbon dioxide to drop your partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 40 to 30 and you'll raise your pH from 7.40 to 7.48, and your fingers and lips will begin to tingle. On the other hand, if you're in, say, diabetic ketoacidosis, that hyperventilation, called Kussmaul respirations in this clinical circumstance, will keep your pH up towards, if not all the way to, that magic number.

A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its parent star and blocks a bit of starlight while doing so. The problem is that the orientations of planet orbits in other solar systems are randomly aligned. Some may even orbit face on. Only about 1% of the planets are aligned so that they can be detected by the transit method.
X3BOyGTeaa	The main problem in answering the question is that we don`t have a good definition of what "alive" means. Nobody has been able to come up with a definition of life which is broad enough to include everything we would consider to be alive, while also narrow enough to exclude everything which normal people would not consider alive.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I am going to say that the answer to the question is no, the universe cannot be alive.<br>  <br>  We don`t need to have a perfect definition of life to exclude the universe from the list of living things. All we need is a criteria which is true of all living things, which is not true of the universe.<br>  <br>  One such criteria is that all living things increase their internal order at the expense of decreasing order (increasing entropy) in their environment.

PnaeoH3eaa	This is not as easy as suggested by the first answer.<br>  "Construct" does not mean draw it as best you can by eye.<br>  <br>  First find the centre of the circle . This can be done by drawing any two chords that are not parallel (preferably at about 90 degrees but it does not have to be exact) and constructing their perpendicular bisectors. These will cross at the circle centre O.<br>  <br>  Now join P the point outside the circle to the circle centre O and find its mid-point M by using compasses not a ruler. Set compasses point on M and pencil on P and draw arc of a circle cutting the original circle twice Q, R.<br>  <br>  Lines from P to Q and R will be the required tangents. This works because of the principle that the angle in a semicircle is a right-angle. This ensures that the lines constructed are at 90 degrees to the radius at the point of contact and are thus tangents.<br>  <br>  P.S. I suspect that you were told to use a bangle so that you would not have its centre point to start with and had to find it.|`|x384qQ3Iaa	A bangle? I think you would be better off using a compass and straight edge.  We'll call the center of the circle, point A, and the point outside the circle, point B.  <br>  <br>  To make the tangent lines start by drawing a line from A to B.  Draw a large arc with radius AB using A as the center.  Draw another large arc with radius AB, but use B as the center.  These two arcs should intersect above and below the line from A to B.  Connect the two intersections of the two arcs you just drew.  That line should pass through the center of the line from A to B.  Draw a circle using the center of the line from A to B as the center, and use the distance to A as the radius.  Note that this circle should also pass through point B.  Finally, the two points where this circle you just drew intersect the original circle are the points where the tangents to point B are.  The source is a way better description than mine, and has great diagrams. Hope this helps.|`|F4phWwBdaa	Draw you circle.<br>  Draw 1 point outside of the circle (doesn't matter where)<br>  Now, attach your point with 1 point on the outside of the circle (straight line, this is called a tangent line, as it only touches the circle at 1 point)<br>  Draw another line attaching the point with a different point on the circle.

AA10597241	This is called an ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The first, or capture, antibody as you know is "stuck" to the bottom of a well in a 96-well plate.  The antigen that you are testing for is able to bind to the antibody and be held in place.  The amount of this binding is directly proportional to the concentration of antigen.  The second, or detection, antibody as you know is labeled, usually with an enzyme of some sort, and substrate added which turns a colour (which is what is "read" from the plate). <br>  <br>  So, both antibodies are needed to literally sandwich the antigen.  As stated before, the amount of antigen that binds to the capture antibody is proportional to the concentration of that antigen.  In return, the amount of detection antibody is also proportional to the concentration of antigen.  The enzyme that's been attached to the detection antibody produced a colourimetric reaction with the substrate, and the "amount" of reaction is proportional to the amount of enzyme.  If you were to simply label the first antibody, which are stuck to the well, every well regardless of the concentration of antigen would produce the same analytical signal.<br>  <br>  E-mail me if you need more help.

La palabra volcán fue derivada del nombre del dios mitológico Vulcano.<br>  Es el único medio para observar y estudiar los materiales líticos de origen magmático, que son el 80 % de la corteza sólida. En la profundidad del manto terrestre, el magma bajo presión asciende, creando cámaras magmáticas dentro o por debajo de la corteza. Las grietas en las rocas de la corteza proporcionan una salida para la intensa presión, y tiene lugar la erupción. Vapor de agua, humo, gases, cenizas, rocas y lava son lanzados a la atmósfera.<br>  Un volcán, en esencia, es un aparato geológico, comunicante temporal o permanentemente entre el manto y la superficie terrestre. Un volcán es también una estructura geológica, por la cual emerge magma (roca fundida) y gases del interior de un planeta. El ascenso ocurre generalmente en episodios de actividad violenta denominados erupciones. Al acumularse el material arrastrado del interior se forma una estructura cónica en superficie que puede alcanzar alturas de unas centenas de metros hasta varios kilómetros. Al conducto que comunica el reservorio de magma o cámara magmática en profundidad con la superficie se le denomina chimenea. Esta termina en la cima del edificio volcánico, el cual está rematado por una depresión o cráter.<br>  <br>  Volcanes en Mexico: El Eje Neovolcánico atraviesa el territorio del oeste al oriente, hasta unirse con la sierra Madre Oriental en el Escudo Mixteco o Zempoaltépetl (a 3.395 msnm de altitud).

The sweat is composed mainly 99% water, some salts like NaCl, urea, ammonia, lactic acid, uric acid, Vitamin C, rather similar to those isotonic sport drinks.<br>  <br>  The other type of sweat glands is found in the "nether" regions of the males, e.g. groin, arm-pits......, and they start to sweat upon puberty.

Of course the resistance is low compared to a piece of wood.".<br>  <br>  Sorry Karen, but in a given circuit that resistance is neither high or low: it's just right for the job. If you start talking about the circuit for the hair dryer: how much of the circuit do you want to include?<br>  <br>  If you go all the way to the power generators, which is the complete circuit mind you, the resistance of the heating element may be much lower than the resistance of all the wires along the way!<br>  <br>  If you only look within the hair dryer and its cord: well, it's say 50 times higher than the resistance of the power cord, the switch and whatnot. So is 50 times high enough for you to consider it "high"? Would 95 times be high enough? Ten times? 1000 times?<br>  <br>  See, that's the problem with stupid questions. The question should have been explicit about what criteria are used to judge given resistance high or low.<br>  <br>  I beg you not to write questions like that. The question writer assumed something that only he/she is privy to. That's the prima facie evidence of a stupid/short-sighted question writer. All those assumptions make you-know-what of yourself.<br>  <br>  As an author, one doesn't have to show off how clever one is to the students who work on the problems one prepared. They pay the publisher a crapton of money for the textbooks, the author better be clever and intelligent, no need to show off. Since many students do not gain full understanding of given problem area anyway, it'd be ill advised to have them remember stupid rote "facts" like what's low or high resistance.

0RSR1FYCaa	Cyclones can produce significant upwelling beneath them due to Ekman divergence in the water.  This upwelling bring nutrients to the surface which can facilitate algae blooms which may support higher trophic levels.  Storm systems may also carry and introduce dust particles to the ocean containing nutrients, particularly iron.  Significant regions of the Earth's oceans are iron limited and input of this nutrient again may facilitate the growth of marine organisms.  Fresh water is unlikely to be of any benefit to marine organisms; as for pH changes, rainwater is somewhat acidic and becoming more so as atmospheric concentrations of CO2 increase, but the ocean has sufficient alkalinity that there are only very very minor effects from a single storm event.  In general small scale phenomena like storms will have little effect on widely mobile and long lived creatures like fish.|`|RXzj8vg2aa	Thunderstorms do both good and bad to sea life, the rainfall brings new fresher water to the oceans, the turbulent seas from the storm stir up sedaments which contain food for the lower end of the food chain.  However, thunderstors also wash CO2 out o fthe air, raising the acidity of the water, killing certain animals like phytoplankton.  they also wash pollutents off of land and into the water affecting both fish and birds.

VvRENINJaa	I would say that the addition of K+CL- to water would not change the pH. KCl is comparable the NaCl, table salt. KCl, or potassium chloride is simple a salt, composed of one positive charge, K+, and one negative charge, Cl-, that balance each other by ionic bonds, such that the pH, or the <br>  -log[H+], would remian the same. <br>  <br>  KCN, otherwise known as cyanide, is a weak acid, and would change the pH pf water by decreasing it, making it more acidic. CN- is a carbon atom and nitrogen atom bound by a triple bond, this compound, in water, has a positive charge it would like to remove, thus the water becomes more acidic, or less basic. <br>  <br>  NaHCO3, or sodium actetate, is a weak base and when added to water is would increase the pH of water, making it more basic. <br>  <br>  NH4Cl, or ammonium chloride, is a weak acid, and will give up hydrogen ions when added to water. Thus, the pH of water would decrease, becoming more acidic.

35cd9ef8010cdc665d566283dd3a1549aa	B.|`|HmnD4h6daa	the correct answer is B, higher electronegativities and higher ionization energies. <br>  <br>  Electronegativity and ionization energy increases as you go across a period from left to right. Charge is increasing (the atomic number increases as you go across a period), and thus, the electrons are more attracted to the positive nucleus. Since it strongly attracted, it takes more energy to remove an electron. Likewise, since the atomic number is increasing, charge is increasing, and therefore the ability to pull electrons is greater. Thus, electronegativity increases. In a period, metals are towards the left and nonmetals are more towards the right.<br>  <br>  electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons toward itself, and ionization energy is defined as the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from an atom

Q6uWCUqsaa	Reverse the order of integration.<br>  <br>  Draw a picture of the region of integration. It is bounded by the part of the x-axis between x=1 and x=e; a vertical line segment from (e,0) to (e,1); and the curve x=e^y (which is the same as y = ln x). It looks a bit like a triangle, with a curved "hypotenuse". To do y-integration first, this region is described by 0 < y < ln x, 1 < x < e.<br>  <br>  Can you take it from there?
