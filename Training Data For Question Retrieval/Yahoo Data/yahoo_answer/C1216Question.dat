20070118043931AAPq5DV	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	L'angle entre les aiguilles d'une montre à toute heure est une fonction linéaire du temps : vous en dites ?	J'ai démontré sur base de quelques propriétés de géométrie analytique et moyennant quelques simplifications trigonométriques que la relation entre la valeur de l'angle A (sous sa forme a + 2.k.pi) et le temps T (exprimé en heure : exemple 17h6min36sec s'écrira 17,101) est une fonction linéaire et s'écrit :      A = C.T       où C est une constante dont je garde jalousement la valeur pour l'instant. Mais si vous m'envoyez un mail, je vous l'enverrai avec plaisir.      Pour résoudre le fameux problème de l'heure qui casse la tête aux apprentis de la trigonométrie, il suffit de transformer le temps donné en heure, le multiplier par C et réduire l'ange obtenu en soustrayant le plus grand multiple de 2.k.pi qu'il contient et vous tenez l'angle formé par les aiguilles d'heure et de minute...      Grace à cette formule j'ai résolu la moitié de mon examen en terminale en 5 minutes au lieu de la demi-heure que prends généralement la question.      Qu'en pensez-vous ?

20060925175335AAi4Q13	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics Questions????	I think i have the answers, but i am not sure about the method.  Can you check these and tell me why i am right?      1) A force accelerates a body of mass M.  The same force applied to a second body produces three times the acceleration.  What is the mass of the second body?            My friend tells me the answer is M/3 and i don't understand why.        2) A mass m is hanging on a string that passes over a pulley and is then attached to another mass 3m that is resting on a horizontal table.  Neglect friction.  Mass m is held motionless and is then released.  When it has fallen a distance h, it will have a speed v.  Find the formula for v.           On this one, i get  the squareroot(gh/2), but as i am following my work, parts of it don't make sense to me.  Can you show me if this is correct or not?      This is it for now, thanks so much!!!!!

Sol: líquido, diferentemente do sólido, suas partículas se movem quase independentemente formando pela sua química uma grande matéria.      Sistema Interestelar: gases, que s?o compostos de partículas livres – átomos ou moléculas – num movimento aleatório. Isso compreende no seu todo, a massa do Sol porem distribuída em forma de gases.       Tarcísio Brito.

20090205180213AARtamO	Science & Mathematics;Physics	A pH of -17 concentrates protons enough to result in nuclear fusion?	According to my calculations, if one were to take a box and line it with gold or iridium for corrosion resistance, and then placed a superacid inside (such as fluoroantimonic acid), the pH of the solution inside would be sufficiently low to cause the protons to align in a crystal lattice, allowing them to overcome their coulomb (electrostatic) barriers and fuse. Two protons can fuse with eachother like this to produce a neutrino and a positron, along with some heat. However, this type of 'cold' fusion obviously does not occur in practice, so what is going on?      My calculations are as follows:   Coulomb barrier = 2.5 femtometers (10^-15 meters); two protons that are 2.5 femtometers away will overcome their electrostatic repulsion and will succumb to the strong force, thus fusing and releasing energy.      The concentration of protons in a solution is equal to 10^(-pH) moles of protons per liter of solution. 1 mole of protons = 6.022*10^23 protons.      Theoretically, a solution where the protons are arranged in a cubic (crystal lattice) structure would be the most energetically favorable arrangement. In this way, each proton would have 5 adjacent proton partners in the 3 dimensional structure. In order for the protons to fuse with eachother, they would each have to be 2.5 femtometers away from each their immediate partners, thus allowing a portion of them to be past the Coulomb barrier enabling them to fuse.      1 Liter = 0.1 meters^3. Each side of a theoretical container would thus be 1 deciliter, or 0.1 meters. If the protons were 2.5*10^-15 meters away from eachother, the crystal lattice inside the box would be   (0.1 meters)/(2.5*10^-15 meters) = 40 trillion (4*10^13) protons in length. The total number of protons in the container would be this length cubed, or   (4*10^13)^3 = 6.4*10^40 protons in the container.   Theoretically, a pure solution of 6.4*10^40 protons per liter would allow at least a partial fusion of the solution (as in, at least 2 protons would fuse together into a deuterium nucleus before the solution would lose too many protons).   The number of moles of protons in the solution would be   (6.4*10^40)/(6.022*10^23) = 10^17 moles of protons.   10^17 moles of protons is equivalent to a solution with a pH of -17, which can easily be created with a superacid such as fluoroantimonic acid. However, as far as my knowledge goes, no superacid can concentrate protons enough to allow fusion. Is my understanding of any of these processes wrong, or can a superacid really theoretically allow the nuclear fusion of two protons?      Note: These calculations only allow for the completion of the first part of the proton-proton chain; the resulting deuterium nuclei do not necessarily fuse with other deuterium nuclei to complete the chain.

20090203064601AAFDfM7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics problem just ratios?	I converted into meters and, divided them, still don't know what to do.      A skier wears a jacket filled with goose down that is 18.1 mm thick. Another skier wears a wool sweater that is 3.76 mm thick. Both have the same surface area. Assuming the temperature difference between the inner and outer surfaces of each garment is the same, calculate the ratio of heat lost through wool to heat lost through goose down during the same time interval.
