20080930222658AAgBcVH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please help......................?	My mother wouldn't allow my father to see me. What would you think/do?   I'm a 21 y/o old female. I was talking to my mother about my fam history. I asked about my father whom I never met. I just found out that he left her before I was born. She told him if he left he should never come back. After I was born, he came back to see me but she wouldn't let him. He called sometimes and she didn't say much. She never allowed him to see me. He stopped calling a long time ago. I asked her why she wouldn't allow him to see me and my bro (his son) even though their relationship didn't work out. That I didnt understand why he still couldn't see us. She said she didn't think he had any of our self interest in mind, he was self-serving, selfish and she was upset that he walked out on her. She said i could still have a relat. w/him. I teared up and said but I'm 21. She said are you just looking for something to cry about. She knows I'm sensitive. I"ve always been since birth. I'm in therapy & on meds. Why do you think she'd say that to me. I cried myself to sleep. She looked distressed. I'm sooooooo upset with both of my parents. All this hurt and anger is building up inside of me.

I know it's wrong to assume and I know I'm getting ready to act really really immature, but oh well.       So there's this guy who was in a play that I saw a week ago.  The plays program had his name and said he was the same age as me at a high school near mine.  As soon as he walked on stage my jaw dropped in awe of his gorgeousness.  So I went home, and like the master myspacer I am, I found his myspace page and its public. He had basically nothing personal in it.  His photos were commented on by a guy speaking of his beauty and great smile and one of his photos was titled Rainbowwarrior.  I know that's a song, but still.... He's obviously a scene kid too, not that all scene kids are gay.      I know that was long, but I really wanna know whether he's gay or not, before I try to seek him out at a show and make a move.  I don't wanna ask either.  I'm really really in to him. Please help.

Every morning at school we all recite the U.S. pledge. Whenever I get to the part about "liberty and justice for all", I can barely say the words. It's such a lie. With all of the hate crimes that go unnoticed by the government, and all this 'outrage' over same-sex marriage, I just can't help but think that the U.S. is NOT living up to what we pledge to everyday.      I'm considering refusing to pledge until same-sex marriage is legalized nationwide. I know it won't change anything, but I guess it's my way of standing up to the injustice. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not unpatriotic. I just want equality.       Any thoughts on this? I'd love it if some of you would consider doing the same as well. :) The more the merrier, eh?

20081014225750AAq3CM8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you ever been saved by divine intervention?	In the fifth grade our school plannd a camping trip out in the Texas hill country. My mom said that if I were to go I would first have to complete all my homework, clean my room, and wash dishes every day for a week. I didnt feel like doing my homewrok (I was in advanced clsses, so i had alot of work) and decided that I would complete half of now and the rest after I came back from the camping trip. Then, my mom told my teacher that the only wasy she would let me go was if I rode in her car.On the day of the trip, my mom took me to school, waited around a while, and left. About 10 minutes later, as I literally have one foot in the car and the other on the ground, my mother drives up honking like a psycho. She charged at me, yanked me by my arm out of the teachers car, and told me I couldnt go. Somehow she had found out that I did only haf of my homework.I usually get my way, but this time, no amount of begging would change her mind. I was on a level of rage that I had never been in before. Around three o clock in the morning the principal of my school called. She wanted to know if I had gone on the camping trip with Ms. Steiner. She told us she would call us back. Turned out that my teacher was hit head on by an 18 wheeler whose driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. My teacher and my friend Nancy were killed instantly. Crystal, Joanna, and jessica were in critical condition. They were in the hospital for weeks. I was supposed to be sitting in Nancys spot. I would have died. But for some reason I escaped the whole thing and I dont know why.

Remember when the republicans were debating who should be their leader for the upcoming presidential election and Huckabee was asked whether or not he accepted evolution and he says something like, “I don’t know why I’m being asked this here but if you want an answer, I believe that God made the world and all life on it like it says in Genesis. If you want to believe you evolved from apes, then go right ahead…” In other words, Huckabee was saying that to him, the theory of evolution is equivalent to the Judeo/Christian creation myth and these two options are really the only two options available for people to ‘believe’; do you think this is how it really is?
20081014234713AAzCenU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do atheists succumb to wishful thinking?	I asked a question a few days ago challenging atheists where they get their purpose or meaning from. Now this is in no way an extensive poll, nor does it speak to all atheists, but I found it interesting that the vast majority said they give themselves purpose and meaning. Fantastic!      Now before you say, 'Sounds good to me.' Lets break this down. If a theist was to say, "I believe in God". When asked why, they replied, "because the Bible says he exists." Pressing the issue, you ask, "what makes the Bible reliable?" And the theists replies, "because God wrote it." Whoa! stop right there, invalid argument, cause: circular logic. Now for an atheist to say, "I have purpose because I give myself purpose." is the same fallacy. Unless the atheist can prove that they are a product of purpose.      As we observe the Universe and its laws we see that it is rational. If it wasn't, science as we know it would not exist. The ability to rationalize would not exist. We could think, but we couldn't verify any thought as rational or irrational. The point is we are a product of this rationality and can rightfully claim to be rational beings.       The same can not be said about purpose. There is no scientific evidence that the Universe is purposeful. Then again this is not the function of science. You can believe that the Universe has purpose and we are part of this purpose. It doesn't make it true, but it is consistent. For the atheist, a purposeful Universe, begs the question, "who or what put the purpose there?" Since an atheist will deny a purpose giver, they can not honestly accept a Universe that has a purpose. But, they want purpose, so they claim they have it. Are they afraid to live a life without purpose? Saying you have purpose does not make it so. Its illogical, inconsistent and yep you guessed it, wishful thinking to believe you have purpose if you are not the product of purpose.       Theists are at least honest in this regard as they state that they 'believe' they have a purpose. It doesn't make it true and can be classified as wishful thinking as well. But for an atheist to claim they give themselves purpose without being a product of purpose and call theists 'wishful thinkers' makes them hypocrites. I know, the truth hurts sometimes, get used to it.

All of these places tend to be really educated and anti-war. Probably because they understand the impact of war much harder being that it was on their soil twice in a century.

20081101000022AAog9Wn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Im 20 yrs old, what religion should I pick and why?	There's hundreds of them out there. Even atheism. I was thinking muslim because its pretty simple, theres only god and all the prophets that helped spread the message, including jesus. catholicism is too complex for me, i mean if jesus is god and god is jesus, and if god created us in his image, i don't quite follow that image because im not blue eyed blond haired, etc. hindu sounded pretty cool, but all the gods look indian, and i dont certainly look like that. same goes for buddhism, but the teachings are really cool and i can really come into terms like that.   my parents were catholic, and i dont think i should believe something my ancestors (maya) were forced to believe when the spaniards got here. ive been trying to follow back the aztec gods but some of the stories are just plain absurd.   so i cant be a shia because im not a decendent of muhhumad either. i guess sunni would have to do.   ive heard awful things about being a mormon too. like all the black ppl being the "neutral angels" and joseph smith being a man who wrote fictional stories.      i gota believe in something, that way i wont go to hell for not doing anything and at least i can be forgiven by one of these gods for at least trying.

20081023203512AAq5qPA	Society & Culture;Languages	Translate this into english...?	美军入侵北京惨败实录   公元2XXX年， 美帝国主义及其大仆从国、 小仆从国， 不大不小仆从国悍然入侵我中华人民共和国， 美军及其走狗军队在北京地区发动突然袭击，我伟大的中国人民解放军和中国人民奋起还击... 大败入侵贼人，打得美帝小儿及其雇佣军丢盔弃甲、 死伤惨重。   以下就各战场进行点评：    一、地图问题       美军大意地使用房地产开发商广告上的地图， 因为这种地图说自己是非常准确的， 而且规划后100年都不会有什么变化结果因为使用这种地图。     1. 空降兵部份原本要降落清华大学的却落入昆明湖中， 会水的投降， 不会水的淹死，全军覆没。   2. 美老猫将军过度依赖地图，以为从回龙观开发区15分钟可以杀入市中心 结果坦克部队在路上整整堵了8个小时。 还没到达建祥桥就被英勇的3轮板车民兵连在京昌高速路歼灭得差不多了。   3 美军的重型坦克成纵队过桥， 事前，经过查阅建筑管理部门的机密文件得知， 该桥的负荷可以承受美军的重型坦克， 可是实战中， 因为该桥的施工单位偷工减料， 在该桥上， 只过去了第一辆，其余坦克均在大桥坍塌后落水被打毁， 卖为废铁。   4 老屯的101师伞兵选择小区规化图上绿地、 会所、 游泳池、 湖泊降落，落地后发现： 他们都落在楼顶上， 因为由于开发商擅自更改规划， 把原先承诺的绿地会所游泳池湖泊都起了楼多卖点钱， 该伞兵群在楼顶与民兵隔着天窗枪战一宿， 因楼顶有大量居民违章架设的各种电线，枪战引发电火美军大部烧死。   5 极个别的伞兵落到地上也被全歼， 因为按原先计划的绿化带、 树从、 园林等隐蔽设施落地后才发现全无， 整个小区除了几条马路还是马路， 路上全都是超速汽车，撞死者甚众。    6 打巷战时，使用的户型图严重失真， 所有户型类部尺寸偏小， 重型大炮均无法装入将军选为要塞的房间。   8 特别值得一提的是美军突袭安贞大厦时， 特种部队妄图沿消防通道突击， 不想消防通道被物业公司封堵或改做他用， 拧坏多把钳子后宣告任务失败。   9 个别特种部队凭借其个人神勇躲入事前选定的民房， 负隅顽抗， 结果按照设计要求为钢筋混凝土的建筑物， 被个别居民扔入多个二踢脚等普通鞭炮后， 整栋楼房发生大面积倒塌， 奋勇抵抗的小区居民与世界上最好的特种部队官兵同归于尽。   二、交通问题    1 美军的机械化部队沿着著名的京通快速路狂奔， 由于路面质量奇差无比，曾在世界上多个危险地区顺利完成任务的越野车， 到达四汇时已被颠散了架，被早已守候多时的收废旧家具板车民兵师一拥而上全部收去废旧... 部分还能跑的，到了国贸桥时却因长达数小时的堵车， 加之被中央电视台错误的天气预报误导， 没有做必要的防护， 被太阳晒得中了暑，  美国佬纷纷去找口水喝， 大批美军因饮用早已经被污染多年的地下水而口吐白沫四肢痉挛不能控制自己拿起枪来乱射... 并高喊： 我的上帝， 这里能住人吗， 我们千里迢迢的打来这里， 真是自寻死路啊!    2  根据中国移动截取的美国佬突击二分队报告： 好端端的大街上突然出现许多无井盖的涵洞， 美国人不能对抗中国人的地道战， 跌进坑内非死即伤， 后无消息，恐已全部阵亡。    3 美军机械化部队进城简直是一场灾难， 一路上有大大小小十几个收费站要交钱，而且按吨位交钱， 同样是过Tank， 中国PLA至少比他们少交一半的钱，而且，连查养路费的也到处设岗， 进了城又被交警罚款，罚到美军机械部队彻底不敢进城。    4 美军王牌101空中突击师套得准确情报：天通园路地面开阔可以作为空降地点， 凌晨一点美军实施突袭 一跳下来就掉进挖开的下水道里。 事后得知： 北京市市政工程部门于十年前就开挖的改建天通园路下水道工程到现在都没峻工， 北京市区内到处开挖的工地让机械化部队寸步难行。    5  更恐怖的是：3环路所有桥不许走重型卡车。 大胖子美军的车辆刚到4环就被城管扣下了， 所有人员改步兵。    6 美军千辛万苦杀到3元桥*路口， 等红绿灯太久， 晒昏了。 面对该路口的36个红绿灯， 见多识广的坦克驾驶员感叹不知道该怎么走，叹北京人民太厉害了，早已动悉先机， 于10年前设好埋伏。   7  最后一支海军陆战队依靠过硬的素质克服万难前进到二环路， 结果不小心上了西直门桥， 就再也没能找到下来的路， 最后在首都市民的注视和嘲讽下全部跳桥自杀。    8 美军一支机动侦察部队先期进入北京后， 由于恰逢沙尘暴， 连续一周， 风沙蔽日， 人不能行， 大量精密仪器无法使用， 战士们由于没有装备必要的防沙眼睛口罩等设备， 无法正常工作， 致使信息化的优势难以发挥，直到从海湾地区调来了精通沙漠作战的部队后， 这一问题才得以部分解决。      三、人民战争    北京市人民群众和各职能单位的积极参战是美军失败的主要原因。    1  残疾助力摩托车民兵师和电动自行车民兵师在战斗中起到了重要作用， 他们充分发扬了见巷就过， 见人就撞的巧打狠打风格， 大批美军官兵被突然从角落里冲出又突然消失的车辆撞伤撞死撞傻撞飞撞得失去战斗力生活...   2 美国中央情报局的谍报人员在战前三天曾经潜入北京和平新城， 妄图作为临时窝点将京A牌照的摩托化民兵师兵力布置情况报告总部， 谁知道使用天鸿房地产商声称的XXM宽带10张关键的总共才5M的布防图照片发了4天... 战斗完毕， 欢庆胜利的市民被告知， 多亏了房产商和网络供应商的杰出贡献， 城市才避免了更大的损失。 大洋另一边， 美情报人员懊恼地说： 假如不是北京的小区宽带， 我们应该能在天安门过中秋节了。    3 美军欲占领一居民小区， 被物业公司误认为是刁民业主雇来的新物业公司， 遂大打出手。 可怜美军， 哪里够打。 城建的物业公司， 一个字， 狠。    4 美军在进入西单商业广场时也遇到同样问题， 上至总经理、 副总经理， 保安都是当兵出身的， 一句不合就动手打人， 美军避之为恐不及。   5 美军先遣部队刚刚通过京石高速公路进入北京， 企图占领某某山水小区制高点， 结果由于化装失误， 被英勇的保安当作进城卖菜农民乱棍打出， 鬼哭狼嚎。   6 美军士兵晚上到雅宝路酒吧街等处的发廊按摸、 洗头、 被装扮成按摸女的游击队员俘虏， 军官肯定是在比较高档的地方， 如天上人间等地被俘获， 经查他们都没有暂住证， 统统送到昌平挖沙子， 至死也没能回国。   7 美军一部按照事前的计划偷袭进入北京市某重要政府机关， 结果， 搜遍整个建筑物未能找到一个正科级以上领导。 正欲离去， 大约上万名讨要欠薪的农民工蜂拥而入， 将身着迷彩制服的美军当作赶来镇压的武警战士， 按住暴打， 由于农民工个个不惧生死， 致使美军伤亡惨重， 所有武器均被农民工抢走并很快变卖折成现金， 抵扣了黑心的开发商所欠工资。   8 美军由于给养不足， 只好以战养战， 为了保证食品质量， 华盛顿特意下令只许在北京使用美国制造的食物， 不料， 大量美军在北京的大型超市里抢到的美国食品， 是北京郊区制造的质量低劣的假货， 众多美军上吐下泻， 由于人数太多， 不得已只好进入中国医院。 结果， 再次被各种假药杀伤， 加之美军不懂得给医生红包等中国国情， 致使很多美军的病情急剧恶化， 非战斗伤亡迅速上升。      美军指挥官“路易?威登”临撤出北京之前， 站在著名的北京西站广场大楼前， 无限感慨到： 中国人民真是太厉害了， 佩服佩服，遂转身朝人民大会堂方向敬礼， 下令撤兵。 由于说话声音太大， 话音刚落， 西站门前吊顶砸下， 可怜大批美帝小儿一命呜呼。   2XXX年， 美帝侵我， 举国与之战于京， 民心所向， 贼大破。 快哉!!!

20090309183556AAlTfKV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists - what do you think of this?	I've often heard atheists say that anyone who doesn't do the right thing unless they fear judgment, is pretty bad off to start with. Frankly, I agree, and so does the Bible interestingly enough (see for example, Colossians 3:22). However, do you really think that people behave just as well when they are not being watched? I know for a fact that everywhere I have ever worked, there is a 180 degree difference in how people behaved when the boss was/wasn't present. Or, as another fun example, my best friend bought an out-of-service police car, and in the month before he had it re-painted, we were amazed to see how people around us would drive so...over-cautiously.      Would you agree that all, or almost all, people behave better when supervised, or is this an Indiana thing?

Most people in those kinds of places in America speak General American. I've never been there though, so I wouldn't know. I know Shane Victorino (Phillies CF) is from there, but he kind of sounds Texan, for what ever reason that is. Is that how Hawaiians sound?

20090103173348AAQ4SfM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is going to hell a punishment for your sins on earth?	Just basically is that correct?      Because if it is then hell is not really  a punishment it is a threat or revenge, all correctly administered punishment is to improve behavior and make sure the mistake does not happen again, all going to hell appears to achieve is revenge. If that is so are christians prepared to admit that their god is    a) vengeful and    b) does not love everyone?       Because if he loves everyone it would fair to put them in hell for a bit and then let them up to hell when they have suffered enough to change their ways, but eternal damnation displays nothing but hatred and revenge.

20060904234650AAPoUJN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Non muslims, how could the Prophet Muhammad tell the future?	God says in the bible that you know if a prophet is fake if what he says doesnt happen. EVERYTHING that the Prophet Muhammad said would happen did happen.      eg.   He told a companion that he would go blind before he died   He told a companion the land that he would die   He said exactly how many years of the Caliphate there would be after him, and that Abu Bakr would rule for a short time. (he ruled for 2 years)      There are several other examples. would a fake prophet dare make so many predictions? this is not mention those in the qur'an (if you believe he wrote it)      eg. (qur'an)   "The Romans have been defeated, In the nearer land, and they, after their defeat will be victorious, Within a few years. With Allah is the Decision, in the past and in the Future: on that Day shall the Believers rejoice"   (this is exactly what happened. Ask someone who has studied ancient history how remarkable this prediction is. it is like if someone said in 1945 that the nazis would be victorious)

Okay, so I was working front register at my job, and I was bored out of my skull and ringing up some guy.  The next thing I know a car slams into the front of my store where the sliding doors open up and almost goes into the store.  I was standing right there and it almost killed two people.  No one was hurt, but everone was shook up.  Two days later I am walking to work and about to cross an intersection.  The light turns yellow and a mini van screeches to a halt.  The car behind the minivan procedes to SLAM into the back of it and completely total their front end (it looked really bad).  Again no one was hurt.  THE NEXT DAY I was walking to work AGAIN and this time at an intersection by a jewel Osco a car is turning into a Mcdonalds parking lot in a the scuicide lane (the one in the middle) and gets thier front end smashed by a truck that was just pulling out of the BK parking lot next to them.  AGAIN I see a fourth accident three days later but this time it was while I was driving to college and it was a REALLY bad collision in an intersection.  Some honda was hit by a truck because the truck was gunning past the train tracks that are directly behind the light (I'm assuming they didn't want to get stuck on the tracks, it's a Horrible set up right there.)  This is four accidents that I have WITNESSED within six days of one another and I live in the suburbs where accident rate is pretty low (not so much with the last one thought).  THIS IS REALLY FREAKING ME OUT.  I don't know if this is a giant coinsidence or what, but has anyone ever HEARD of somthing like this.  (I don't know if anyone got hurt in that last one)   P.S.  I am not a troll (if that is the proper terminology) and this is REALLY happening to me.  I'm posting this in spiritual because I just don't know where else to post it.

20090301181207AAET9lm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God loves everyone, then why is there Hell?	My girlfriend broke up with me for the second time 3 weeks ago, after which I went through an experience and asked God into my heart. She drinks a lot and lives life for herself. A few days ago I tried to be friends with her, but then one night she started talking to me drunk. I told her not to talk to me drunk again because it tempts me and I don't want that in my life. She kept saying that thats not fair if we're friends. I tried to tell her what happened to me and how I asked God into my heart and she mocked me saying I had 'just found some church people to hang out with'. She told me I should not be preaching to her and that she is a good Christian because she goes to Notre Dame and was raised Catholic.      So what I want to know is she sins every day and has no problem with it. She mocked me when I tried to get her to ask God in her heart. In her path, she is destined for hell. But she also made a good point in that God loves everyone. People are generally good and just make mistakes. So my question is who is right here? Even though she is a sinner and does not accept God in her heart, will she still be granted eternal life?

20060706005231AAZFoIr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did you know...Muslims and Christians are both wrong about who created earth and man?	There are numerous books that were left out of the Bible that tell a much different story about the creation of the universe. Some also address reincarnation. I suggest starting with the Gospel of Judas. Here are some others that I know of:Zostrianos, Allogenes, Trimorphic Protennoia, Pistis Sophia, Ascension of Isaiah, Apocryphon of James, The book of Enoch, Hypostasis of the Archon.       There are many others, but basically they all say that Satan and his demons created the earth and mankind. They did it without the approval of the other "lower Gods". When they speak in church of the "SIN of Adam" what they really mean is the "sin of ADAM".      Adam was not the first man either. Jesus was, only Jesus was made by God the "self generated", not God the Creator as Muslims and Christians believe.       Both Muslums and Christians are wrong, but not entirely so about salvation. Jesus is your best bet, but if you haven't got any merits, you won't get into heaven.  Also Hell is not eternal.

20060916033522AAR2QOq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why was the US Muslim community stone, cold, silent in the days, weeks and months after the events...?	of 9/11. Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world according to some sources. In the US however it's still much smaller than Christianity. Isn't it up to the more reasonable members of a (relatively unknown) religion to step up and make it clear that they in no way supported the actions of the murderous radicals who claimed that they did what a good Muslim should do?  My Muslim housemates also fell silent with me (I ascribe to no organized religion btw)! They avoided me and did not want to discuss the issue at all. They did complain in approx. December of that year that they were “sick of hearing on the news about the hunt for Bin Ladin”. (I just glared when that was said.). Anyone know the possible reasons that less radical members of the Muslim community fell silent and did not openly publicly condemn the terrorist's actions or address the topic at all?

They're not from Earth but from some place (anywhere out there) called heaven  coming DOWN here.       2. He has a different time zone- "A day unto god is 1000 yrs to man" (this is only possible with a planet rotating around a sun/ star)      3.

The notorious night Stalker has said "When I reached the age of twenty, twenty-one thereabouts, I met a guy in jail and, uh…he told me about Satan and    I picked it up from there.  I read books and I studied and I examined who I was and what my feelings were. Also, my actions. Just like the Hezbollah and    different terrorist religious organizations around the world-it is a driving force that motivates them to do things and they believe in it whole-heartedly.    It had the same effect on my life. Islam seems to be a religion which promotes violence and promises reward in the afterlife to cold blooded killers.    This is quite similar to Satanism. Yes, it was a statement that I was in alliance with…the evil that is inherent in human nature. And…that was who I was. "       Do you see his connection ?

Why do people always act african immigrants have had it worse than American blacks and thats why they are smarter? Im 17 and all of the Africans Ive met live in the suburbs and never spent a day in the ghetto. When its tough to make it out the city. I never met an African when I was living in the hood. All the Africans Ive known have come straight from Africa to the burbs and seem to be afraid of the hood. Suggesting that maybe the ones that come already got $$$ and they never lived in the slums of Africa. The piss poor blacks over in Africa arent the ones coming over here cuz I dont think you can go from there to the suburbs. It pisses me off that the immigrants use the people that are REALLY from the gutter in Africa to gain sympathy for themselves when they lived well in both places. I think the true poor blacks over there that cant get over here can say they have it worse, not some suburban Nigerian dudes.

Well one of the kids named Tevin came up short cuz he bought me a squirrel wit defect, and I clearly state under Law 12 that the animal gotta be defectless. So I didn’t accept it and Tevin said I was a “reverse bully”. WTF is that??

We all know that looks can be deceiving, and that it is wrong and unfair to judge a person just by the way they look, dress, carry themselves...etc..etc... but then there are many who believe first impression is the last impression...      Which category do you fall under? Are you typically judgemental of a person just on first glance, or do you take the time to get to know somebody before forming an opinion about them?       I know it's very hard not to do that, because it is human nature to be critical of others...   What is the general impression that people get of you when they first see you? I try my best not to judge a book by its cover, but it can be reallyyy hard when someone just acts/dresses/speaks like a slob and a lowlife... I have a really hard time getting past that, and I usually make little or no effort at all to try to get to know him/her after that. I know it's mean, but I can't help it...   OK... this is getting too long.... I'm done       Go ahead, share

Many of the buildings in this region have varying styles of design.  One of these styles is known as a vaulting style.  This style led to the general use of heavy walls and piers in place of the light walls and columns that had sufficed to support wooden roofs.  Another style used in Auvergne is the Byzantine structure.  This type of architecture involves the incorporation of domes and steeples on top of buildings and churches.

Then I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent." The Prophet asked her 'Do you want to remarry Rifa'a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your present husband." Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah's Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin Al-'As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, "O Abu Bakr!

20090309192327AA5pF06	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: explain to me exactly how you decide which hadiths you follow?	I have heard it said that not all hadiths can be followed, as some are false. So how is it you judge them false or true, is it as a whole or just in part?      For example, I hear Bukhari mentioned a lot (as well as many others). I'm asking about any of the common hadiths that are considered "true," but for the sake of the question I'm going to use Bukhari as an example. Feel free to answer regardless of what you follow though.       When you are following a particular hadith, and you accept it as true, do you then accept ALL of the Bukhari hadiths? Or is it only some of Bukhari, and some of others? Or let me put it this way... If one Bukhari hadith is deemed to be accurate, does this mean that all of those by Bukhari are as well, or no?      Also... do all the differing beliefs out there agree on the method you describe, be it by following in part or in whole?      Oh, and please, I'm not asking you all to argue about who is right and wrong if you all do it differently. I'm just trying to understand how it is you all decide.      Thanks in advance for answering.

OK, Every single time a Muslim does something wrong it is plastered all over the news that they are Muslim, even if it has nothing to do with religion.      For example, If a Christians robbed a bank it would not say Christian robs bank, but it would say Muslim robs bank!      That lady that killed her family was Christian but the headline wasnt Christian Woman murders family.       So why are Muslims always labeled and pin everything on religion?      The Quran clearly states that Killing is wrong and whoever kills will find themselves in hell fire.   The Quran says suicide is a major sin.   And the Quran says you should not kill any just because they are non-Muslim.      So why the double standard?

20090309174235AAXztc4	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you think muslim head scarfs should be banned in public in westernised countries?	I actually think hijabs look really elegant on women. I can understand why some people may find burquas intimidating. But why is there such a ferore about women wearing them in the UK? So long as it is their choice and they are not forced to. I think if they are forced to then it is wrong. But i know muslim women who have no problem with them, they have been brought up with this and it is their norm they can choose to wear them or choose not to wear them.      Surely if hijabs are going to be banned (as there have already been instances) then the habits of nuns should also be banned??      Don't get me wrong, I dont think nuns habits should be banned, i am just drawing comparison.      Also another point, if you look at a habit and you look at a burqua, there is only slightly more material on the burqua than on the habit!  And a hijab has less material to it than a habit!!

20081015151507AAgb4VB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Ok... so I dont know what to do... any suggestions?	So like, ive had a MAJOR crush on this guy for like 7 mo. now and last weekend he came out on facebook as being gay (and in a relationship). He doesnt know im gay. So like I've tried textin him and what-not and he has been kind've avoiding me. He told me we cant hang out this week cuz hes working all week and some other b.s. reasons that never were a problem before. We even have the day off this friday and I wanted to tell him that I'm gay too, but he wont reply to any of my invitations. His boyfriend is this skinny boy b*tch who is SO not right for him. I kind've want to tell my crush that I like him, but I dont know what to do. UGH. My friend thinks that he may be trying to make me jealous, because the relationship looks like its for show rather than a real one. But theres this other guy who caught my eye. But I still am in love with the first guy. I dont know whether to ask the first guy out (while hes in the "relationship"), ask the back up crush out, or wait for guy #1 to break up with his boyfriend.       What should I do?! It hurts so much when I see them together, nothing can hurt worse. But like ive only seen them together like once, the entire time they've been goin out (less than a week). And if he is "working all the time" he wouldnt have time to have a boyfriend, right?

OMG jaw drops off face.   i'm so embarrased to talk to him any more cuz he's very very determined that i'm gay and probably even thinks i like him. i dunno what to do.       idon't know what to do. i don't want to ignore him..hes cute. and stuff. but part of me wants to be a queen and ignore him. but it's more like my loss than his. but my EGO! and i hate being gay

I mean Jesus will come down to earth in the Middle East, where he was supposedly crucified.. He won't have blue eyes and blond hair.. And he won't be white.. He'll look ARABIC! He will be tanned, dark eyes, dark hair.. And obviously his name will not be Jesus, his name would be his real Arabic/Hebrew name that they used to call him back then which is Essa or Essaw..    He will most probably not be able to speak English..    Will people think he is a terrorist??
20090218182631AARK3kj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should religion be the cause of someones termination at work? Is this fair? Why or Why not?	1. A woman becomes pregnant and a christian school refuses the renewal of her contract. They believe she should stay at home with her younger children. Is this fair, should she have to abide by the school boards belief?   2. Employed by a church but then fired because the person was not a member? Is this fair?      These are actual court cases and can be found on this website   http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu...     I just wanted to know others opinion on these cases I feel it isn’t fair that people are losing good jobs because of their belief. Getting terminated from a job because of their religion is like telling them that there religion doesn’t matter, and that’s taking away from their rights as citizens. Do you feel the same why or why not?

20090309221354AAmvwNa	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to deal with bad neighbors?	Our family has a problem with bad neighbors. Their son usually bullies my little brother. The problem is, whenever my mom came complaining to her, she said that it is my brother's fault, and that my mom is just being racist and doesn't understand black culture(when in reality, she could be racist against ukrainians. Although unfortunately, the only forms of racism recognized as a problem are racism against hispanics, black people, jews, and chinese people). My other little brother(12 yrs) came to the bully(10 yrs), and told him that if he does that, there is going to be trouble, and showed him his fist. Now what they did was, they came threatening us that if this happens they call the police(but not to forget that, that kid was already not aloud near my siblings, he was also two years older then my little brother, and he did the same thing threatening to hit.). Also, she told the neighbors, so now they all say we cannot come to their place, my siblings aren't allowed to play. I'm wondering how can we get back at them, or is getting back at them a bad idea. Also, what can we do then? We cannot sue, because we are bad on funds, and because the kid's mom is a lawyer. So now, we have trouble even when we were avoiding this kid. How do we deal with this?

I've been going out with my boyfriend for a few months now and i am really starting to fallin love with him. Tonight one of MY friends, Amanda, texted him and asked him to her prom this coming may. She never told me she was going to do this or ever asked me if it was ok, she just asked him. They have only hungout three times, the times i invited her to hangout with us.       I think this is obsecenly inapproriate of her. I think it is somewhat of an unspoken rule that you dont ask your friend's significant others to "hangout" or to Prom without making sure its ok with your friend first.       Also im a little upset she didnt ask me. She has only met my boyfriend 3 times where as i have been friends with her for a while.       I just want to know am i right in thinking that how she acted is inapproriate or am i over reacting?      Also i know she has a thing for my boyfriend however i also know nothing will happen because well, hes gay.

20090309221035AAOZFlZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isn't the Islamic/West conflict more of a class struggle than religion?	The main thing that stands out to me is that generally the people from the Islamic nations who truly don't like the West many time live in societies where the average person experiences much more financial poverty than in the "West."      Now generally, while I'm not advocating the UN because I'm still unsure about what they fully do, they do have a good measure called the HDI which measures countries by life expectancy, literacy/education, and economies the highest ranked Middle Eastern/Western Asian Islamic nation is Kuwait.      Generally Kuwaitis from what I know are good allies of the West. Now compared to Kuwait, a country doing financially not-so-good is Pakistan and many terrorists come from there and actually reside there if you believe that Al Queda/Bin Laden are there. So it seems to me that financials are kind of a great secular equalizer and the religious conflict kind of stems from misplaced anger of people in Islamic societies with economies that aren't doing so well when they should be angry at their leaders and not the "West."

20090309221008AAWQrJx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will you pray for my husband?	First off I want to say that if you are going to answer this question with an answer of "well he's better off not being a christian or believing in God", hit the road! I am not looking for negative answers here I just need help with a prayer.    Second, technically we're not married but we have 2 kids and have been together for almost 6 years. We've just been together for so long that it's easier to call each other husband and wife.       But here's why I need everyone's help in prayer. I want to go to church. I want to raise my two kids (who are 3 and 1) in church and I would really enjoy it if Eric went with us. Up to a year ago he said that he still believed in God and when asked if he would go when I went, he said he would. Guess I snooze on going to church, I loose my chance of my whole entire family going. He only says that he doens't believe in God now because all of the problems we have had in the past years. They're the kind of problems that we have made ourselves and because he doesn't want to take the blame himself, he's blaming God because after all, God is supposed to be there for us all the time, right? And I know that even if I don't talk to God, he's still there. Eric just seems to act like God should have been there physically to stop the problems. (And there just the kind of average problems with money, and having to move occasionally and switching jobs problems)      I tried to take my kids to church one time last summer and did plan to go back but after not going for so long, the same old easy excuses for not going back got in the way. Those same excuses still hold out today unfortunately. I guess my whole family could use the prayer of going to church and I do feel the determination to get myself and kids nice clothes and shoes and return to the church that is right down the street from us. I've been praying a lot more lately and actually picking up the Bible but it's hard to talk about things like that and God if I have no one to talk to about it. It actually breaks my heart to hear Eric not want to reach out to God or even try to go to church with his family. I was actually crying yesterday because the discussion came up that he's not a christian. And no matter of seeing my tears or knowing how upset I am about it, does he seem to want to change his mind. I want us to be married but more and more lately, I don't know how I feel about marriage even though we already have two kids together. I don't want to leave him but is it better to not be married or to be married and he not a christian? Would there really be a difference? I see my old friends on myspace or facebook rejoicing about the Lord and I would love to do the same but without Eric's support, I don't know how to. I guess it's kind of like if you were a sci-fi fan and I wasn't and there was this really cool show but you felt too awkward to talk about it.    So could I just get some help in praying for Eric that he will reach out to God and go to church with me? I know that the more people who pray together the more powerful the prayer is. And I am so sorry for this long y/a question here.       And once again, if you don't believe in God and all you want to say is "why would you want to believe in God anyway? or You're better off without believing" please, skip to the next question and get your two points there. I'll have respect for you if you have respect for me.      Thank you

Just tonight I heard a faint whistle and "mom", so I go to check on my kids and both are sound asleep. I also hear/feel like someone is walking through the house and I go check but there is no one. I've noticed subtle shadows, light where their shouldn't be light and feel a presense that doesn't provoke fear but something that tells me to seek it out.      One night my kids and I were getting ready to play a board game and while I was opening the box to layout the contents, I feel a cold draft of air on my back and arms. I turn and once again... NOTHING!      I dream of my deceased mother handing me or assisting in delivering my baby or of feeling a baby moving inside me, even feeling the outline of the babys body. I didn't pay any attention to the meaning because I thought it was because my sister was pregnant, we were anxiously awaiting my first niece, after a very complicated pregnancy. The dreams stopped and have now begun again.      I have this feeling of "Waiting" for something to happen, and I'm usually really good about following or listening to my intuition but this one has me baffled, and extremely confused. I know it's a lot of stuff to translate or analyse, but your help in the matter is extremely appreciated.
20090309212250AA7XR7d	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it appropriate to stay at his apartment overnight already?	I've been dating a guy for about 3 weeks. I'm 20, he's 22. We met through a common extra-curricular: running, and he lives downtown near our university while I live in the suburbs.      I often drive to town. He invited me to go to his friends party on Saturday. Obviously I will drink (saint-patricks!), so I won't be driving... I could always take public transport back to my house late at night (it would take over an hour) But I'd also have to be back downtown early the next day for work... so... If he offers to me to stay at his place (which I think he will), should I accept?      It's very expensive to take a cab because it's a 30 min drive      I really wouldn't have sex with him, nor would I sleep in the same bed with him! But just for convenience sake since we will be drinking, I wont be able to drive, and I also work the next day practically right near where he lives!      Is this a good idea? Or should I really make my way home that night?      What do you suggest I do?
20090309224746AAklOMp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk and not payin attention to women getting their butts beat to death? I dont care, they are the ones choosing these losers so they get with they deserve. Thats how i feel about it..

20090309213038AAJFCqJ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Have heard about the new gay beating in alanta?	Atlanta police are investigating an assault that happened outside  Blake’s on   the Park  bar in midtown Atlanta. Blake’s on the Park is the official home gay   bar to GorgeousBoys Online Entertainment Network.  The incident happened on 10th   Street when the victim was walking from Blake’s toward the MARTA station when   he said two men approached him at 10 p.m. Sunday.      This area of Atlanta is home to thousands of gay men and where I live and work.   Last night around 9 pm we were out at a group get together enjoying pizza and   about an hour later our owner headed back to the office to finish some work. I   went outside to let our owner know I would be late getting in to work the   following day. As I was headed back into the establishment a boy approached me   with a bleeding nose and I helped him inside the bar where we called 911 and   began to search the area for the two guys the boy claimed beat him after he was   asked by them if he was gay. The boy was transported to a nearby hospital. He   has since been released from the hospital and the suspects are still at large.      “We haven’t heard of it happening at all. We pride ourselves in this   community that people can be themselves, they can be who they are,” Philip   Rafshoon with Outwrite Bookstore told Channel 2 Action news camera crew who   followed up on the scene later after the assualt.      That all changed. The victim told another friend that he was leaving the   Blake’s bar when two men approached him and said hello. He said, ‘Hi,’ and   then they asked him if he was gay. He said, ‘Yes,’ and that’s when he said   they began punching and kicking him. It is also suggested that the men were   obviously high and were perhaps “hustling” on a nearby corner.      “We know there are people out there who don’t like gays and lesbians for   whatever reason and we hope that we’re not seeing the flood gates open…where   people start committing a lot of crimes against gays and lesbians,” said   Phillip Rafshoon.      Phillip Rafshoon owns Outwrite Bookstore and the beating happened near his   store. If the victim was targeted because he is gay, Rafshoon said the “whole   community will demand justice”.      “It’s critical that we find the people who did this. It’s also another   reason we need a Hate Crimes Bill in the state of Georgia. There is none now,   and we need to send the message to people that they’re not going to get a   scare and they’re going to get caught!”      Be sure to visit Just One Hot Minute for more

I am an atheist, and I was wondering why others do not believe in a God? I know many do not because it appears to be the logical choice, it's reasonable, and there is little, or no, evidence to point to the existence of a deity. However, how many of you were influenced by particular events? I know some cite the death of relatives, natural disasters or the continued existence of tyrants and despots etc as to why they cannot believe in a God.       For me, it was a mixture of both. I found it logical that there was no "God", and this opinion was cemented by several events that I have witnessed.       What about you?

The three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all purport to share one fundamental concept: belief in God as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe. Known as tawhid in Islam, this concept of the Oneness of God was stressed by Moses in a Biblical passage known as the "Shema" or the Jewish creed of faith: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord." (Deuteronomy 6:4)    It was repeated word-for-word approximately 1500 years later by Jesus when he said: "...The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord." (Mark 12:29)    Muhammad came along approximately 600 years later, bringing the same message again: "And your God is One God: There is no God but He, ..." (The Qur'an 2:163)       When are you guys going to come out of hiding and see the truth of your role in this Ummah?

Okay well there is this girl that I kinda know from school.   When I first saw her I thought she was really hot, then I found out   I had no chance cuz she was str8 lesbian.      I have talked too her a few times at shows and it seems she flirts with me a lot.  My girl friend doesnt mind cuz she is lesbian.      Ok ill be honest so you guys can see the pix, I am a pretty attractive guy, and I think she might be attracted to me.  When girls think im hot and that want some from me, they do what ever this hot lesbian is doing.  So I am not sure if I should try for her.      Here are some questions for you guys:      Do you think she'd be doing that because she likes my band?   Is it possible that she may be bi and likes me?

20090309225026AA0jB5Y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians hate Atheists and Homosexuals so much?	I'm serious.   Is it just because they aren't the same as you and anyone who's different scares you?      Is it the same reason you hate people of other religions and call them heathens?   You say you don't burn people at the stake any more but you condemn anyone who isn't Christian to hell, right?   Didn't Jesus say a lot of sh*t about loving your neighbor and forgiving others and being accepting of those around you instead of hateful?   In fact, didn't he talk a whole lot about hatred and how, you know, you shouldn't have it in your heart?      Why do you hate homosexuals and atheists then, or rather homosexuality and atheism?   Give me a real response.    "Because God says so" isn't a real response, because He doesn't.      In the OT God says all kinds of things, but you always pick and choose which of them your going to believe, like the crap about gays. Jesus says to love all people, but you seem to also be able to pick and choose who you love.      You know, I like Christianity, by the way, I'd just like to meet a Christian some day.

It angers me when people are judged because of their nationality. Why do people have to act that way? I am a diverse person and enjoy many different cultures/nationalities/ and races. Why do people have to judge groups of people 2,000 miles away from them, and condemn all of them because of a thing some/many, and usually not the majority of them do/act/commit.   I am an American, and am often judged because of people around me when I am less like the people judging me. "Why are all Americans ____?" And diffidently not just Americans, every nationality/race and whatever is judged for stupid things, and Americans often do judge others, but not ALL!!! so PLEASE when posting things about ANY "different kind" of person near or far from you. PLEASE do not condemn every person that happens to fall under that specific group you are judging, How is that ever justified?

I'm talking about the type who have lots of friends, who know their way around better. And they are better at fighting than you. How do you deal with them? Last time, what happened was that bully was stronger then me, so I couldn't fight him, and he turned everyone against me, even using things such as drugs. How do you deal with these types? And they do get to the point where you cannot ignore them, as in, they want to take your seat in class, they may insult me, but when I insult back, they try to provoke a fight, knowing that they are stronger. The worst thing is that they justify the fight..   It would be good if I know, because I move around a lot, and these types usually have better connections than I do.

He said our friendship wasn't going to change and I had nothing to worry about. Then in a text he later said he knew the whole time. Then, the next day when I asked him about it he said he was just kidding because he was drunk, which I really don't believe because he sounded completely serious. We worked together and were acting completely normal. We would text back and forth everyday and ever since coming out to him we still did. Now out of no where is completely ignoring my text messages, even when I ask if I did something wrong and he is still ignoring me. Is this ind games or what...i dont know.

I seemed to get a bit sexually aroused by looking at more muscular guys, but I never really thought that I wanted to really do anything with them sexually or anything like that. I like girls, I don't really get horribly aroused with them, but I'm not "against" them. I always want to be as muscular/masculine as the guys I look at. Growing up, most of my friends were girls, none of them being too girly, mostly tomboyish, that can fit in with guys. I never really acted to feminine either. Most people think I am gay, which really upsets me, and I've even been asked out on a date by a guy. I don't dress particularly feminine, nor really that masculine either. I don't think I'm bisexual. Plus, I'm a homophobic person, nothing against gay people, but I just don't feel comfortable around them...

Well me and my daughter live with my family so we share a room; just this morning when I was changing her diaper she kept looking towards one corner of the room, pointing and acting really scared.   I don't know if she saw a spirit or what but now she is terrified to be in our room.   I've taken her back into our room several times since this morning and she keeps looking at that one corner, really scared.   My dad just passed away in January but I'm certain that if she saw my dad's spirit, she wouldn't be scared. Her and my dad had an awesome bond, she is my parent's 1st grandchild so she meant so much to my dad.   Either way, I just need help. I don't know if it's a spirit she is seeing and if so I don't know if it's a dark spirit and I'd like tips as to how to get rid of it.      My mom has gone around our room sprinkling holy water saying:   "In the name of God's 100% pure light, dark spirits be obliterated from here.    God's 100% pre light dwells here always & forever. Where there is God's light you can not exist. God's pure light is in every molecule of our being and no dark spirit or energy can enter."      She did that earlier today and my daughter is still too scared to go into the room.   Any advice would be appreciated.   Thanks

20090309225758AAx4pyh	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Mut'ah humiliation: please advise!?	Hi,      A bit about my background: 22 years old, Christian, spanish      I broke up with my boyfriend who was Shia, and we dated for a bit (over 1 year). And when we did date, it was through the mutah... and from what I understood at the time, he told me that he had to do it. So coming form someone who didn't know about it, I agreed and thought that it was his way of dating.    Then I researched more about it and through these forums such as this one, I found out different opinions. For the most part, I find a lot of people are against it and there are some that are for it and presented decent arguments. The latter gave me hope and that maybe he was a good guy and he just had to do it this way to date me... but the negativity on the issue made me think. I asked him about my concern and he always gave me a complete answer that pretty much reassured me that "it was not just for sex"      To make things short, it has been a few months since we broke up. But I can't help but feel really humiliated... also whenever I see his friends or the select few that knew about us, I would feel embarassed. I'm also paranoid and think "What do they think of me? Do they think I'm a ****?"    Did it mean anything at all? How am I looked at? Can I do something to make me feel better about this?      I try to see it as just dating and breaking up normally, but for some reason, the fact that there was some religious aspect to it - makes it hard to forget and even more humiliating that it really is!      I don't mean to drag this on, I am still healing OBVIOUSLY :( any comments/insights would be appreciated... Thanks for your time!
20090309231925AAo2Eu8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah's witnesses, if siamese twins are seperated surgically, may they later donate blood one to the other?	Or can you conceive that the bible was not thinking of blood transfusions or seperating siamese twins when it was written. Consequently composing injunctions from a book written 2000 years ago is going to get you into a big tangle.
20090309231613AAKVObI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah's witnesses, what steps do you take to ensure that you are abstaining from blood when you eat meat?	Please bear with me for rephrasing a previous question, but I have not received satisfactory answers from Jws yet. The best answer so far is that they rely on the government. Who in their right mind trusts the government when your eternal salvation is at stake? For those wondering what this question is all about, Jehovahs will allow a loved one to die rather than accept a drop of blood transfused into their veins. So Why are they so blase about their meat?
20090309225911AAeLmSv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What does it mean to be mature when talking about sex?	People tell I am immature sex. I know where to buy condoms, other forms of birth control. I am not afraid of taking off my clothes in front of the opposite sex. I am 18. I have a job. I am in school. I do know I can get pregnant when I am ovulating. I try to keep track of my ovulation. How mature do you have to be to have a penis in you for like 10 minutes?
20090309232156AA3zRLc	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Cashless Society in the UK?	I just watched a short video on BBC and the reporter was talking about the possibility of a cashless society. I thought everyone in the world already used their debit/credit cards more than anything. I live in America and I never carry cash on me. It's just easier and you can do so much more with a card. Like pay bills online,shop online,if your card gets stolen,you have to have your PIN to use it..you don't even have to go in the store to pay for your gas. Isn't it better to use cards? Do you think the world will eventually go plastic?

She can be very controlling of me, wanting to know where I am all the time, wanting me to be in contact with her every hour or so and has ALOT of insecure moments which she wants me to reasure her of my love for her etc and make her feel good about herself. I know this sounds totally crazy to be with someone like this but we do have our great times but it becoming very emotionally draining. I was wondering if any of you guys have any suggestions on how to deal with this?
20090309232154AAE9vrV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isn't it a little ironic that you can spell...?	Lie, Hell and Hole from the two words HOLY BIBLE, but not truth, heaven and whole? I understand it's just two words, but it's the title of one of the most holy books around.      Try to come up with GOOD words from HOLY BIBLE and not evil ones... And hobby and holly do not count, holly leads towards a lust-related action (sin) during the holidays and hobby just means it shouldn't be everything, only a hobby.

There is enough geological evidence to prove the Book of Mormon is an ancient record just as Joseph Smith said He translated it, not wrote it. Yet Billions of people are still blinded to not even read it to know for themselves. Why? What if it is all True. How would that help your mortal jouney here in life. Being a Latter-day Saint is a blessing and honor and protects one from the evils of the world.

I would rather take my chance with jesus christ. If i told you to run  25 miles streight and at the end was a a pot of gold. Wouldnt you rather take your chances for that pot of gold.

We dont know for sure but to me life with eternity is the ultimate prize.)Were only on this earth for 60 years but Jesus Christ the son of god promised anyone who follows him would live in eternity.

Is he subject to logic absolutes (i.e. can God make A = not A)?  Is God measurable?  Is God something or a concept pointing to an unknown?      Obviously nobody can know the answer or if there is a god or whatnot, but I'm just curious to see how those of you who believe in God think about god.

I just read a review on the movie Donkey Punch and was deeply disturbed. Why they even had to move this movie from the UK to America is beyond me; but it seems like an agenda. I didn't even know what a Donkey Punch was till I checked the urban dictionary, and it turns out that this is not the only sadistic, criminal, and misogynistic sexual act out there. There is also the Angry Dragon which causes a girl to choke, and more where that came from. Why are girls even tolerating such acts to be performed on them anyway?
