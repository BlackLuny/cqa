The tile mosaic sheets I have are 1x1 in total size made up of small 1 inch square tiles.  The tiles don't fit well under the cabinets, too much space to leave, not enough space for an extra row of tile to fit.  Can I or should I clip each tile individually to make them fit, use a tile saw, which I imagine would be difficult as the sheets are not taut, or is there another alternative I'm not thinking of.  Suggestions?

20090129004943AApXkQ6	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How can I regulate the heat and air conditioning in my house?	Certain rooms in my house are icy cold and others are overly hot.  I was advised to block the vents so that the airflow could be redirected to the icy rooms. The vents are from the 1950's and are painted shut.  The ones I've been able to open have a lever behind them that makes it impossible for me to try to block off because I can't tape or screw anything that would block off the vents in order to redirect the flow.  According to the renovation stores the vents are no longer available so they can;t be replaced.  Any suggestions? Thanks.

20090128204200AANykDm	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	HELP electric water heater - thermostat or circuit problem from panel?	I'll explain this briefly what has happened.  My electric water stopped working.  I hit the reset button and it works again.  The water is scalding hot and then it needs reset again, I did this for 2 days in a row each time it needs reset again, which provides temporary relief.  So, after scouring through these posts, I decided to change both thermostats, assuming the thermostat was bad as the water was getting unusually hot before it kicked off.  After shutting off power through the breaker, I replaced both thermostats and nothing, the reset button wouldn't work on the new thermostat.  I bought another thermostat and still nothing.  I put the old one back in just to get another tank of hot water and now the reset won't work on that one either.  I buy a cheap 4-range volt tester to isolate my problems and see that I'm not getting any power anywhere.  I put all the connections back to original on the first thermostat and get nothing.  I go to the top of the WH, where the power comes in and put the volt tester on those wires and that shows no power there.  Have I fried the wires?  The breaker has never tripped once.  Is the breaker bad?  At this point, I'm going to call an electrician, but I'm concerned that I have bigger electrical issues.  Did my faulty thermostat cause the line (or breaker) to go bad?  As mentioned, it's never tripped once.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
20090128205121AAT9cK1	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How much is too much for my list of home repairs?	I am a home owner and am looking to have a bunch of home repairs done and need to figure out what kind of cost I am looking at.      Here is the list of things I need done:   Install 3 sets of mini blinds   take out old counter tops and install a newer one or resurface the one I have and just replace a small part(the lip) under one of them that is where the dishwasher normally goes.   I also have this back door its a sliding glass door that the threshhold needs to be completely redone. There is a peice of wood in place where there should be bricks, so that needs to be taken out, put a peice of metal in there so water cant seep through and then replace the bricks.   The toilet is constantly going, I heard its a small inexpensive repair.   I have 2 bathtub/shower installs that were painted (yes there idiots), they are peeling now, so I want the paint stripped off.   I have 1 light that needs fixed as well as a fan.   My hot water heater needs to have a "bladder added to it.   I also have a dishwasher that has some issues too.         Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you all.
