gxL9qeTyaa	I doubt anyone will hire someone who doesn't have a certificate or a degree. Some places might but more than likely no. I am taking online  classes for (actually 3 different courses) Medical claims and billing (coding), medical transcription, Medical an dental assistant. if you want a cheap college try Ashworth college thats where I am doing my online classes! Good luck!|`|nKfDLunjaa	It's best that you get certified. I don't believe you need to have graduated from an official school the sit for the certification test.

MbzyriZ4aa	If you have "cash" to pay for a new car you may get even better deals.<br>  Just don't let them know right away that you are payi ng in "cash"...<br>  <br>  But to be honest with you: Buying a brand new car is the dumbest thing you can do... as soon as you drive it off the lot it is considered a used car and has lost up to 20% in value....<br>  <br>  Buy a certified used car from Carmax.<br>  <br>  And stop looking at a car as an asset... it constantly depreciates and you will always end up paying more in loan payments then what the car you drive is worth.<br>  This is what a car means to me: It has 4 wheels, I can depend on it because I make sure that it is regularly serviced, especially the oil changes, and it gets me from point a to point b. <br>  I have the strange urge to be the sole owner of that car and don't understand why you would want to rent it from the bank.<br>  I don't care how hold it is... my last one was 20 years old before  it came to an untimely end: It was parked on a hill and all the sudden a brand new little Saturn came rolling backwards down the hill and obliterated my car's front end. How do you think the owner of that car felt when he found that his car was gone because he forgot to set the E-brake? He is still paying for his heap of junk... mine was bought and paid for many, many years ago.... his insurance paid me $1300 and I bought that Taurus 9 years ago for $1500...<br>  Now who made the right financial decision? <br>  <br>  Buy a decent used car for $3000 and go to Carmax to get a certified used car.<br>  <br>  About your planned house purchase: Credit Score looks good, employment history: should be OK.. Income is OK but one thing is missing: Do you have a substantial down payment?<br>  You need to have up to 20% down plus another 3 to 6% for closing costs, etc.<br>  <br>  Summary: <br>  <br>  Buy the used car with cash and send the monthly car payment you don't have into a savings account. To keep that car running for another 10 years: Do an oil change every 2 months and check all fluid levels and tire pressure once a week.<br>  <br>  Keep your credit records clean - do not add a car loan to the load before you apply for a mortgage and keep your credit card debt to an absolute minimum. (no more than $1000 total).<br>  <br>  Save up for a decent downpayment... if necessary move into a cheaper place to save more money faster.<br>  <br>  Wait another year or two... the housing market is still tanking.<br>  You won't lose anything but will be able to buy "cheaper" in about 2 years.<br>  <br>  And save as much cash as you can... Have huge savings account balances and your bank will gladly talk to you about a mortgage... trust me.

yAh2f59maa	The price of an Australian 3 pence (3p) from 1943 seems to vary from about 1.8 AUD and up to about 10 AUD based on what is showing on EBay.  The value is also based on the condition, so a roughed up coin is worth less versus a shiny uncirculated coin.  The real value would most likely be sentimental for people that lived during that time or historical since this is when Australia was working with the Allies during WWII and it is likely many soldiers handled that coin.  It is a nice keepsake to have.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/__1943-three-pence_W0QQ_kwZ1943QQ_kwZthreeQQ_kwZpenceQQ_ckwZAustralian" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/items/__1943-three-...</a>

2sXqm4u9aa	Not sure what you mean by positive response unless you mean good faith.  Either way, call your bank tell them what happened and stop it.  It's like stopping payment on a check.  In the alternative if the transaction or the money has been taken out of your account call the phone number listed on your bank statement for your phone transaction, tell them to remove it as you are not satisfied, then the bank will have you sign papers that you have attempted to resolve this matter and then they can handle this dispute for you.  Misrepresentation of a product or service is basically fraud.<br>  <br>  Just be carefull in future as there are all kinds of scams going on and nothing is ever free or just pay shipping handling its all a come on and don't fall for it.  REMEMBER IF IT COSTS YOU MONEY ITS A SCAM.  All the offers they send over internet telling you its free for just shipping and handling you just need to delete and ignore.  Sorry you are having trouble.  CALL THE BANK AND THEY WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

335NpJktaa	Snus is more like a powder tobacco and you usually put it in your upper lip<br>  <br>  "Snus (IPA: /snu?s/) is a moist powder tobacco product that is consumed by placing it under the upper lip for extended periods of time. It is a form of snuff that is used in a manner similar to American dipping tobacco, but typically does not result in the need for spitting. Snus is also unique in that it is steam-cured rather than fire-cured, is not fermented and contains no added sugar. The sale of snus is illegal in the European Union[1][2], but due to exemptions, it is still manufactured and consumed primarily in Sweden and Norway."|`|vz1pacbpaa	hum??? dont know sorry!
VW7RT8nraa	Did you not do a walk through with them before you left? If you hadn't, then I would do as the gentleman suggested before hand. I would also recommend checking your lease. In the apartment that I lived in, the lease clearly stated that I would have to pay for anything that was above 'normal wear and tear'. To me, cooking in your own apartment is normal!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YCQAPMXcaa	$95 for cleaning - was it beyond normal wear and tear cleaning?  If not and it was a "normal" charge for cleaning the apt., then no they cannot charge you for that.  Carpet cleaning, again, how long did you live there, normal wear and tear charges cannot be charged.  If you lived there for 3 years and you never had your carpet cleaned upon moving in, then no they cannot charge unless it is beyond normal wear and tear such as stains that needed pre-treating, etc.  $300 for paint, I'm a property manager and I left my community (did not live on the community I managed, another community) and lived there for 4 years and they charged ME for painting of the apartment, when I requested the invoice, low and behold, they had not received it yet?  They even knew I was a property manager, well, needless to say, I told them that they charged for a job that they were not even invoiced for yet and had no proof of it, they couldn't charge me for it and they knew it.  Normal wear and tear.  Some people cook with curry, heavy oils, and it does seep into the walls and kilz or primer must be used prior to repainting, they would have had to repaint the apartment anyhow upon you moving out so they can only charge you over and above normal wear and tear.  Like the other person said, get the invoices, if there was a move in condition sheet upon moving in and even if you did not do a walk through upon you moving out, this move in condition sheet should have been filled out upon moving out by the maint. supervisor or the property manager.  We do this all the time and do a pre-walk out 60 days prior to someone leaving us too.  Get your itemized list from them, invoices, pictures (they must have them to prove to charge you) and if they have all of it, then review on your own and then discuss when you know what is what.  Hope that helps.  Good Luck.|`|xyRMRXVmaa	Request pictures before and after and an itemized bill, pain used, cost, carpet cleaning company used, cost, etc. If this was due to "the smell" keep every contact from them for your records. Make sure you request there explanation in writing. <br>  <br>  Once you do this. Ask yourself "If it was just the smell, then why the need for paint?" Do not ask them this question before you get there statement in writing with pictures to prove it. <br>  <br>  If they can prove that there was no other way to get the smell out of the carpet and stains off the walls then you need to pay. If they can not prove this with pictures they have no case in court. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

DuR26Pojaa	I felt like a terrible person- like I was part of a giant Problem Machine whose job it was to make people miserable. I wasn't in telemarketing, I was in tech support, still a 1-800 number. It was support for people with a very large nationwide DSL internet provider. This is what it's like:<br>  <br>  Call center is located in the US most of the time. Software support, that's another story.<br>  <br>  They really can't tell you exactly where they're located, for obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  Tech support is outsourced to independent call center- support personnel work for the call center, not the ISP.<br>  <br>  If you're lucky enough to get a center that has a quality control survey at the end of the call, the score you give will be taken into account- barely.<br>  <br>  The real value call centers place on their minions is how many calls they can get through in an hour- regardless of whether they solved anyone's problem or not.<br>  <br>  Computer engineering degree? Yeah right. High school diploma or equivalent? 50/50 chance.<br>  <br>  Not being a drug-free work environment is how most call centers keep asses in the chairs despite ridiculously high turnaround.<br>  <br>  Training is 3-6 weeks "full-time" mostly goofing off. 75% how to use the call logging software and protocol, 25% how the internet works. A 60% score on the test is passing.<br>  <br>  If your call takes more than 10-12 minutes, expect the agent to start directing the conversation to your browser, operating system, or computer hardware.

Ch9TedMcaa	When people are buying a stock, it usually drives the price of the stock up.|`|XZG35fxSaa	If a lot of people buy a stock, it will drive the price up.  What happens after that is interesting.  If it's a good company, and people keep buying and holding, the price will continue to rise in the long run.  But if it's a penny stock, and everyone only bought in the hopes of making a quick buck, the stock will eventually plummet when everyone changes their minds.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	By definition, every trade involves someone who wants to get the stock and someone who wants to get rid of it. All too often, the advice to buy is made by people who are anxious to sell. If the population of buyers is for some reason better informed than the sellers, then the price will go up. But if the sellers, by dint owning the stock already and having reason to learn something about it, are only too happy to sell, then the price will go down.|`|ASosqMM2aa	if everyone buys the same stock eventually goes up!!!
Z6RfbYq5aa	well I'm in the same situation. I will be graduating with my BA this year and I am trying to figure out what will be my next school goal.  Just know that law school is very very expensive. and you have to ask yourself do you want to really pay back that much in loans....However, where there is a will there is an way. So if you have your mind set for it, don let nothing hold you back. If you work hard at something it will work out for you. <br>  <br>  If I dont go to law school I will pursue my PH.D in Psychology....I got to make up my mind tho....|`|bOoYeFA5aa	if u really want to be a lawyer,<br>  u should go for it..<br>  <br>  it's your ambition.. <br>  good luck <br>  =)
MbzyriZ4aa	This is not something you want to leave to a "mail order bankruptcy company".

All they can do is type forms.  YOU are the one who must be in control of 100% of the legal issues involved in your case. They are not allowed to be anything more than a secretarial service.  Many of these places do give legal advice anyway, and it is often wrong. Some of them have come under very heavy scrutiny by the courts for beinng scams and for practicing law without a license.

Just fill it out as if your were still repaying your loan, you will still be credited with any interest you paid.   It is next year that you will claim the extra income from the foreclosure, not 2008.
d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Reena is correct. The company contributuions will not go with you unless you are vested. However, some 401k plans have immediate vestment, so check on yours. Very few have that though. <br>  <br>  For just 8 months, my opinion is that it's more trouble than it's worth. Just open a Roth IRA and go with it. Why deal with all the hassle?|`|nqiHWiacaa	Book now!! <a href="http://money-moneyloan.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://money-moneyloan.blogspot.com</a>|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Couple of minor details: The money your company adds to the 401K is not yours until you are fully vested. That usually means you have worked for them for at least 5 years and had that 401K the whole 5 years. (times vary... but I never heard of a vesting plan that wasn't at least 3 years...)<br>  <br>  So you will lose the employer contribution when you leave your job in 8 months and can only roll over your own contributions.<br>  <br>  Other than that... good idea. When you leave talk to your bank and let them handle the roll-over. If your 401K get's rolled into an IRA directly by the bank and you do not receive the check first, you are not going to pay any taxes. Make sure that the money goes directly to your new IRA and not to you personally. (Let the bank handle this...)|`|AA12291184	i'm pretty sure you can roll it over without paying taxes.<br>  <br>  It might be a good idea being they will match whatever you put in.

Cousins never make you eligible for EIC, HOH or the chilt tax credit.  The *only* thing they could get you is the $3500 exemption.|`|AA11284831	You don't need to prove a blood relationship, just that they lived in YOUR home ALL year.  School and medical records are the preferred method.  <br>  <br>  Since you cannot claim them under the Qualifying Child rule and since cousins are not in the class of Qualifying Relatives that you can claim if they don't live in your home, you don't need to establish a blood or familial relationship to them.  Residence in your home all year is what you need to prove.

ug2by9Bqaa	Hey Nahid - I guess the best way to start would be to find out where your target market "hangs out".  In other words figure out who you are ultimately targeting your network to, is it teens and young adults or is it older business professionals who are looking to network?  <br>  <br>  Then find out where they are currently interacting online, study what THEY WANT and then give it to them in a better format or with more options than they currently have.  After all that is really what we use the web for is information or solutions to our problems and interaction with those we can relate to.<br>  <br>  Once you find that place or places, create an identity and provide as much useful information and benefit to that community that you can.  You can then start gently promoting your network and make it as beneficial and easy for your first clients.  They will tell their friends and you will have the whole viral effect of the web going for you.<br>  <br>  Also - write 10-20 press releases and submit them to as many free directories as you can.  Write articles on your target audience on places like ezinearticles.com and direct people to your new site.<br>  <br>  Just remember that the best way to start driving traffic to a site like yours is by having other people refer their friends and colleague's to it instead of you telling people why they should go there.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Aaron|`|W8Uf5LsAaa	Join some of the good social networking sites and post your site there.

If you do not have any experience, but have other related job skills, I think you should still be asking for that much at the very least.

Simply discussing outright to your future employer exactly what were the grounds for various felonies will greatly mitigate any adverse reactions that may be held by your employer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	It is based on the companies policies for hiring.  If it is a Union job then no generally you will not get hired with a felony on your record.  From an HR stand point absolutely do not lie about it.  Be very up-front and honest with your future employer.  A general rule of thumb is if it is a non-violent crime that is older than 10 yrs old then it should not matter as much.<br>  <br>  Alot of places will still hire you, it just depends on the company.
RkfIPD7Iaa	Unless you are clearly working as a contractor, no, this is not the action of a 'legitimate company'.<br>  <br>  Legitimate companies pay their withholding amounts correctly.  That means deducting and submitting Federal and Provincial tax, both employee and employer portions of EI and CPP, and other provincial specific amounts such as medical plan premiums, childcare premiums, etc.  By paying you directly with a cheque, they are avoiding all those, and probably WCB premiums as well.<br>  <br>  In short, what they are doing is probably illegal.  Not the actions of a 'legitimate company'<br>  <br>  IN any event, enter your income in line 104 of your T1.  Hope you saved up for your tax bill.  You'll also be required to pay both halves of your CPP premiums.  EI should be okay, since you are not eligible without employment status.|`|aifDtz1Naa	I am not sure why your company is doing this other than to try to avoid paying into EI, CPP and Workers Compensation.  I would be very suspicious of any company that operated this way.  Legit companys have a legit payrolll department.  I will be honest with you, it sounds hinky.  There are ramifications to both sides for this "gross cheque" method they are using.  <br>  <br>  For this years tax season, enter the total amounts you received from work into box 104 "other employment income".  Be prepared to owe.|`|fYEp45mAaa	I wonder if your employer will even be reporting this seeing as to how they don't issue a T4, anyway, line 104 is where "other income" is entered.  Sounds a bit iffy.
uw3J8M0waa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Become a "poser" who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions. "Posers" carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums. Again, contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners, accordingly. The hourly pay is around $10-$12 per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities.<br>  <br>  3. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  5. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  6. Become a proxy/stand-in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home/apartment. Acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor. Charge $1 per each package handled by you.<br>  <br>  7. Consider becoming a restaurant-cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants-cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers. Whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list, you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time. And when their name/assigned number comes up; you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served. The call back fee is usually around $0.50 cents on a per head basis. For example, a couple would be charged $1.00 while children under 6 would not be charged. Placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant -- often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system. You realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile. The restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison.<br>  <br>  8. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11986894	for summer jobs, try to ask neighbors if you can mow their lawn for few dollars ie: $10.00 every 2 weeks.

vCePK8gMaa	You could have begun the eviction process back in August.<br>  <br>  Step One: Prepare and Serve Three-Day Notice. <br>  <br>  Before filing a Complaint to recover possession, a landlord must serve a Three-Day Notice demanding payment of rent or possession of the premises within three (3) days (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and legal holidays) after the date of delivery of notice. After the expiration time on the service of the Three-Day Notice you may proceed with filing the Complaint for Eviction. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step Two: Complaint  & Summons <br>  <br>  Prepare Complaint: The landlord shall file the original Complaint and sufficient copies of the Complaint for each tenant with the Clerk. The Court must also receive a copy of the Three-Day Notice and a copy of the lease, if one exists. You must also attach a copy of the notice and lease to each copy of the Complaint. The Complaint must be signed in the presence of a deputy clerk or must be notarized by a notary public. <br>  <br>  Issuance of Summons: After the Complaint is filed and the fee paid, the Clerk will issue an Eviction Summons/Residential. A copy of the Complaint, three-day notice, and lease (if one exists) will be attached for service on the tenant. The Sheriff or a private process server can serve this Summons.  The Manatee County Sheriff’s fee is $20.00 per tenant and must be in the form of cash or money order. Other Florida counties may vary. If paid by cash, you must personally deliver the Summons to the Sheriff’s Office, Civil Processing Department. Private process server fees vary and you would contact them directly.<br>  <br>  Certificate of Mailing: If the tenant cannot be reached either personally or by substitute service, the summons can be served by posting (attaching to a conspicuous part of the premises). If this occurs, the landlord must request that the Clerk mail the notice to the tenant by Certificate of Mailing. <br>  <br>  Step Three - Day in Court<br>  <br>  Answer by Tenant: The tenant has five days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after service of the Summons to file an answer. If an answer is filed and monies are deposited, the landlord must contact the Court to schedule a hearing.<br>  <br>  Default:<br>  If the tenant fails to answer the Summons, the landlord may file a Motion for Default by Clerk/Default and proceed with obtaining a Final Judgment for Possession and obtain a Writ of Possession These forms are included in this e-course.  <br>  <br>  The Clerk is authorized to enter a Default at the end of five days after service is obtained upon the tenant. Upon the default being entered by the Clerk, the Judge will then review the file and enter the Final Judgment for Possession and direct the Clerk to issue the Writ of Possession.<br>  <br>  Furnish the Clerk with an original Final Judgment for Possession and a copy for each of the tenants and yourself. You must also furnish the Clerk with pre-addressed stamped envelopes to the tenant(s) and yourself for mailing the conformed copy of the Final Judgment. The Writ of Possession should be presented to the Clerk for issuance.<br>  <br>  Step Four: Wrapping it up <br>  <br>  After entry of the Judgment, the Clerk will issue a Writ of Possession to the Sheriff describing the premises and commanding him to put the landlord in possession after 24 hours’ notice conspicuously posted on the premises. The Writ must be served by the Sheriff. The fee payable to the Sheriff (Manatee County) is $70.00 by money order, check or cash. If cash, you must personally deliver the cash and the issued Writ to the Sheriff. The Clerk cannot accept cash payment for the Sheriff.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11215123	You must begin formal eviction immediately.

It is illegal to prevent entry of the lawful owner of the property.<br>  <br>  I evict for this, if I know about it, but I rarely do, as I tend to knock.<br>  <br>  If you are the landlord what you are supposed to do is have a locksmith change the lock again and give you all of the keys.    Lock up your house, with a note to contact you for the new keys, along with the cost of the locksmith (about 200).<br>  <br>  This is the only time a landlord can change the lock on a sitting tenant.

Otherwise, how would you know the previous tenants, their friends and relatives, or the landlord's drug-addict psychopath children won't use keys to the old lock?<br>  <br>  If the landlord ever needs to get in (e.g., for an emergency of some sort), he may charge you for damages caused by having to hire a locksmith or to break in. Some leases may prohibit changing locks without permission, but there is almost NEVER a reason that a landlord needs a key to  your premises, as long as you're in possession. <br>  <br>  Just because they own the property doesn't mean they have any right to be there without your permission, although some states make "trespass by landlord" an exception the criminal trespass statutes.|`|3yrpDNavaa	Unless it is specifically prohibited by the terms of the lease, there is nothing illegal about changing the lock.

Any "credit repair" company that claims to be able to wipe your credit clean is a total scam.  I dont understand how that one error could have impacted your credit so negatively, especially since you eventually made good on the debt.  Since the debt obviously went into collections, yes it will drop your score significantly, but not enough to keep you from getting a home loan.  I have an old paid-off collections debt and I still managed to get a home loan without any problem but, then again, I dont live in Australia.  Maybe things work differently there.  I'm thinking maybe you have a few more bad things on your credit report than just the one unpaid phone bill.  But, regardless....you made the bad debt so you'll have to fix it yourself.  There are no magical companies that can fix it for you, but there are plenty of companies that claim to be magical that will be happy to take your money for nothing.

75ae1769bd601acf1a03c19d97bcc822aa	Bad credit debt consolidation loans are of two types:<br>  <br>  1. Secured bad credit debt consolidation loans:<br>  <br>  These types of bad credit debt consolidation loans are secured by a collateral usually some property or a guarantor. Since, the lenders find something to bank upon in case you default on payments, the interest rates on secured bad credit debt consolidation loans are cheaper, the lending amounts are higher and the repayment period can be long.<br>  <br>  2. Unsecured bad credit debt consolidation loans:<br>  <br>  Persons who do not have anything to offer as the collateral or security, can take unsecured bad credit debt consolidation loans. The lenders find themselves at increasing level of risk while giving such loans. The existing bad credit situation and lack of a collateral, make them charge high interest rates and offer low loan amounts to offset the risk involved. But, a person who has a bad credit and cannot provide a collateral has little choice, but to take these high interest loans.

9k6WfEFCaa	The answer is yes.<br>  <br>  The Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was amended by The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act in 2003, outlines the laws that govern the credit bureaus and the entities reporting to the credit bureaus, the data furnishers. These laws specifically give consumers the right to challenge the accuracy and verifiability of the information being reported on their credit reports. <br>  <br>  Should the credit bureaus and data furnishers not comply when asked to by consumers, the law requires that the information be removed. The law also states that consumers do not have the rights to have information removed from their credit report that is accurate, timely or verifiable. <br>  <br>  In addition, credit experts can help consumers manage and structure their credit to achieve higher credit scores. Because credit scores are based on mathematical models that are a mystery for most consumers, there are a lot of options they may not be aware of to optimize their scores. For example, making sure their credit card companies are reporting their high credit limits, activating inactive cards and transferring business debt on personal credit cards to a business credit card can all dramatically raise their credit scores. <br>  <br>  These are just a few of the reasons why credit repair is not only legal, but also easily done so within the confines of the law itself.<br>  |`|BO5w10IAaa	First you need to re-pay any outstanding bills that show on your credit. Second you need to get a sacured credit card and make sure you use it in little amounts and pay it off every month.

eBI8UuGqaa	In general, it is a bad idea to get out immediately after staying invested through all the loss brought by this financial crisis. This means that if you cash in and move your money to a CD today, you will permanently accept this loss, and would not be able to take the advantage of a possible upside. If you invest long term 7-10 years or more, the market will have enough time to rebound. See <a href="http://www.ameri-financial.com/headline-story/401k-contributors-should-you-get-out-now.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.ameri-financial.com/headline-...</a> But is this answer right for you?<br>  <br>  In addition, you need to consider your risk tolerance and match your investment portfolio to your risk level. Taking too much of risk is bad because the loss can be devastating, as we saw last month. But the truth is that taking too little risk makes the investor lose too. This loss is a missed opportunity to make more money with your investment. If your risky investments exceed your risk tolerance, you should do exactly what you were thinking about - moving a part of your mutual fund holdings to FDIC insured cds/money markets.To properly estimate your risk tolerance they usually consider your entire financial situation: salaries and monthly obligations, debts and assets and, most importantly, your financial goals. Try a free financial analyzer <a href="http://www.ameri-financial.com/finance-test/personal-finance-test.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.ameri-financial.com/finance-t...</a> <br>  <br>  If you do decide to sell some of your Roth IRA holdings, think about tax consequences. Move your money into another Roth IRA account to avoid tax penalties.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10007793	No its not a good idea.  Keep it where its at.  Its not a good idea to try to time the market.  As long as you have at least ten years to invest Just keep your account balanced according to your asset allocation and risk tolerance and keep contributing.  It will get better.  It may take several years (like 4).  And IRA is a long term investment.  Dont invest for the long term with a short term view.|`|9HPUzoJRaa	it all depends on what your time frame is.  if you need to retire within the next 5-10 years, then yes it might not be a bad idea.  the only problem is that interest rates have come down so low you likely wont make much.  BUT making a little is better than losing any amount...<br>  <br>  but if you are still young and have time, it is quite possible that we can recover and move on before your retirement time comes.  and so finding some quality companies with little debt, and sensitivity to economic fluctuations (i.e. food and drug stocks) which also pay a dividend of at least 3.5 to 4.5% you should likely do fine.<br>  <br>  the most important thing is to know what you own, and understand it fully.  all the aspects of the business and what conditions it needs in order to grow and be profitable.  People will never stop buying food or drugs, or soap no matter what happens to the economy, so pharma(MRK, PFE, CELG, AMGN, etc), consumer staples (KFT, JNJ, PM, MO)  are the types of stocks safest in this environment because the have dividends and dont need a strong economy to make money.  it is also important to read the balance sheets of the companies and understand them.  stay away from companies that have a lot of debt.<br>  <br>  to answer your question its like I said:<br>  <br>  depends on your time frame, and what you own.

ak3NBmINaa	Rent to own is a fool's game. It's not even a good idea for simple stuff, like furniture. <br>  <br>  Why? The odds are stacked against you RENTING for 30 years to take ownership. And do you think a landlord would really wait 30 years for you to pay off the loan, like a bank would? No way. Rent to own means you pay higher rent now, let the landlord get the benefit of using that extra money, and after a few years you are required to come up with a real mortgage to buy out the landlord. It just doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  Your best bet? Rent and save. Rent the smallest, cheapest place you can stomach, and save every $ for a downpayment. <br>  <br>  Then, go out and buy one of these low-priced houses. And when you tire of the place in 7 years, you can sell it, take the profit and buy another house.<br>  <br>  If you tire of your rent-to-own house, all you can do is walk away and LOSE time and money.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Rent to own very rarely works out in favor of the buyer/renter. Almost always, there ends up being something that goes wrong and the renter is stuck trying to get back the small portion of money that was supposedly applied toward the purchase. The landlord keeps the house (or sells it to someone else) AND keeps all the rent money you paid. <br>  <br>  You are way better off to just rent the cheapest thing you can stand to live in, live on a tight budget, save for a down payment, then get a conventional fixed rate mortgage that you can afford.|`|68739b67b5932e0083c62113790d8bf2aa	No !!!!!<br>  Only a small percentage of your rent goes against the amount applied toward your down payment. It is a win situation for the Landlord. He gets to charge an extra bit more on your rent and by the time one or two years go by all you have is a couple hundred bucks toward deposit.<br>  And....usually by then the Landlord decides to sell the home before you can afford it and will offer it to you first but you have not enough down payment. <br>  There may be some situations out there that have worked out in the rent to own scheme of things, I have not heard of any.|`|moiMSUYYaa	It is probably a good idea to do a month-to-month lease because you will be free to purchase a house if you find a good buy without breaking the lease. If you are talking about a rent to own house and you really like the house then you need to have an attorney draw up an agreement spelling out the conditions of the arrangement. <br>  <br>  You would want to agree on a price, how much down payment, how much of each month's rent will go toward the purchase, who is responsible for repairs and a ton of details about which you would never think.<br>  <br>  By renting a house in the area you will be able to watch the market and look for the best buy in where you are living. You can get your financing in order and find a good buyer's agent to help you look. Rent to own arrangements work about 1% of the time.|`|8QWr77YZaa	Unfortunately it is a good idea to rent to own in this current state.  Renting just to rent is a waste of money.<br>  <br>  Saving to "put money down" is just not happening.  Aquiring a loan right now is not the easiest thing in the world.<br>  <br>  This also depends much on your time frame.  If you can wait 4-5 years then you might be able to secure a loan.. no guarantees.  But if you are renting, you might as well rent to own.

It’s better to have some sort degree as a back up before you start your career as a pilot. Being medically unfit, unable to pass the checks, accident/incident reports any of these can take your license away. How sad would it be after all the money and time you spend training and working hard yet you lose it just like that!

The impact of each element fluctuates based your own credit profile:<br>  <br>      * Payment history - A good record of on-time payments will help boost your credit score.<br>      * Outstanding debt - Balances above 50 percent of your credit limits will harm your credit. Aim for balances under 30 percent.<br>      * Credit account history - An established credit history makes you a less risky borrower. Think twice before closing old accounts before a loan application.<br>      * Recent inquiries - When a lender or business checks your credit, it causes a hard inquiry to your credit file. Apply for new credit in moderation.<br>      * Types of credit - A healthy credit profile has a balanced mix of credit accounts and loans<br>  <br>  <br>  The "Think twice before closing old accounts before a loan application" is key here.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	yea, close it. <br>  technically, if you havent been using it, then they have nothing to report to the credit bureau, which means its doing nothing but showing up as an "open" account on your report. <br>  <br>  i closed 2 of my cards a few months ago, and my credit score jumped up almost 20 pts!!!!|`|7eMz1nT2aa	sell your xbox

bOa1kXUdaa	Cramer's using historic support levels based on the lows that AMD was at around 1991. Theoretically, it will find support at these levels, but I would be wary.

There are far better companies out there with much better upside potential.<br>  <br>  Also, be careful of Cramer.

There's not much difference though since you'd probably only have PMI if the loan amount was very close to the value of the house (more than 80%). It's not as bad as it used to be since it became deductible though.|`|FQRjfbW6aa	The factor used is determined by the loan to value & your credit.  The answer to your question is C.

Equitable does not mean equal, but rather what is fair. The court will encourage the parties to reach a settlement on property and debt issues otherwise the court will declare the property award.<br>  <br>  If the parties cannot stipulate to a property settlement, the court will distinguish between what is to be considered separate and marital property. Separate property will consist of the following: (1) acquired prior to marriage; (2) by gift or inheritance; (3) in exchange for any separate property, or (4) obtained from income or appreciation of separate property, if the other spouse did not contribute to the preservation and appreciation. The marital proieprty will consist of the following: (1) any property acquired during the marriage by either spouse; (2) any increase in value of any property to which the spouses contributed to the upkeep and appreciation; and (3) any retirement benefits. <br>  <br>  The marital property is divided by the court, without regard to any marital fault, and after a consideration of the following factors: (1) the contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, appreciation, or dissipation of the marital property, including the contribution of each spouse as homemaker, wage-earner, or parent; (2) the value of each spouse's property at the time of the marriage and at present; (3) the economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property is to become effective; (4) the length of the marriage; (5) the age and health of the spouses; (6) the vocational skills of the spouses; (7) the liabilities and needs of each spouse and the opportunity of each for further acquisition of capital assets and income; (8) the federal income tax consequences of the court's division of the property; (9) the present and potential earning capability of each spouse; (10) the tangible and intangible contributions made by 1 spouse to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other spouse; (11) the relative ability of each party for the future acquisition of capital and income; (12) the employability and earning capacity of the spouses; (13) any social security benefits; and (14) any other factors necessary to do equity and justice between the spouses.

If the will says it's yours and there is no other name, you don't have to share it with anyone. <br>  When my husband's father died, he left us bills to pay. They were our bills, not just my husband's, because that's how we operate. So, I guess it works both ways. It's very nice that you can have this piece of property.

bTSTIv1Uaa	All of these answers are dependent on the laws of the state in which the property is located. Some state laws require both spouses to sign the Mortgage/Deed of Trust if it is their primary residence; even if one of them is not on the title. Ask the title company how they have been instructed to prepare the deed BEFORE you have to sign it.|`|AA11173563	the note can be done only in your name but she needs to be entitled as a joint owner. So her credit and income will not be used to qualify the loan at all|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Just your name gets you the better rate.  Young couples do that all the time.|`|AA10150940	One other thing to think about and this is a worst case scenario...<br>  <br>  If just your name is on the title and you die, then your wife will have to go through legal channels to take ownership.<br>  <br>  If both names are on the title with right of survivorship if one dies the house automatically transfers without question to the other.<br>  <br>  It might make it harder to get the loan but if the worst should happen you might have wished you waited until you both could go on the loan.<br>  <br>  Just an additional thought.<br>  <br>  But yea pretty sure like everyone else is saying you can just go on the loan yourself if that's what you need to do.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|vsq9SW9Maa	Your mortgage rep should be able to run it both ways.  If you are primary, they really use your credit score mostly to determine the rate.  They can pull your credit a bunch of times in one day and it doesn't affect your score, so have your rep run it both ways and you'll see which is better for you both.  She is still in school, but does she contribute any income?  If not, then her debts will hurt you.  If so, then you may qualify for a larger mortgage even with her debts.|`|vigFmfLmaa	They don't make it mandatory.  If she's not contributing then I see no reason for her to be on the loan.  However, I, as a wife, would want my name on the deed of my house and then it would also have to be on the mortgage itself BUT not the loan.|`|QM7cAE4vaa	The mortgage on our house is in my husbands name, as my credit isn't good.  Yeah, you can have it your name only, it's possible.|`|68739b67b5932e0083c62113790d8bf2aa	Here is the deal.<br>  If your spouse's monetary obligations will harm your chance of best rates and settlement, then you alone should apply.<br>  <br>  Later on after her situation is better you can add her to the mortgage. She will not lose any entitlement to the property if she is worried about that. Make sure after you purchase that you have a legal and binding will that gives her the property and estate to avoid any interference from the State or others who may have interest.

YL27l32gaa	Miya M, Home insurance covers lots of different things. I'm not familiar with all the fine print of my policy, but my homeowners insurance agent is always a phone call away. Try visting your agent or a homeowners agent in your area. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Home-Insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Home-In...</a> They should be able to help you.|`|AA10045620	If you have in the lease that you would be raising their rent by that amount so that they have renter's insurance, you can.  Otherwise, I do not believe it would be legal since renters insurance is an option, not a demand.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	You can't get renter's insurance on behalf of your tenant. That's not how it works. So basically the $50 would be a penalty for not having renters insurance. <br>  <br>  As for liability insurance, you should be carrying that now to cover damage to the building and structure and common areas, and incidents that happen in the common areas. Otherwise someone could have an accident and sue you big-time. Renter's insurance only covers personal property, it does not cover the building itself or any of the structural features. That is covered by the landlord's liability insurance.  Or are you perhaps wanting to collect a security deposit in case of damages? That is a different issue altogether.|`|IO1JRcl0aa	Renters Insurance only covers the tenants prop. Insurance that covers liability insurance covering the tenant, all occupants and guests, for personal injury and property damage including damage to the property, is the homeowners insurance you need to cover the prop, and only you can get it not the tenant.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	No you can't do that.

MYxYzOLCaa	You might want to read Jim Cramer's Real Money (in bookstores).  It's a bit advanced but there is some good advice in it.<br>  <br>  I suggest following Warren Buffett since he is the world's greatest investor.  Be careful though because his company buys stocks that the media says are Buffett purchases, and he also buys mostly preferred stock which is different than common stock (regular kind you see on charts and stuff).  But he has been buying BNI Burlington Northern common stock lately and a lot of it, so I suggest that.<br>  <br>  The Intelligent Investor is a book by Ben Grahmn and is Warren Buffett's favorite book on investing.  It is a classic, although it may be a bit hard to read or over your head.  You can get a more modern version with commentary too.  The original was written in 1947 or so.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in learning about when to buy in the short term, candlestick charts show the volume of buys and sells, and give patterns that can help predict short term market movements.<br>  <br>  As for long term, you want stocks that are well known brands that are strong.  It's also good to find stocks that have had consistent and growing dividends for decades such as JNJ (Johnson and Johnson) and PG (Procter and Gamble).  Dividend growth stocks (stocks that increase their dividends consistently) are good because if you buy them for a certain price and they consistently increase the dividend, then you will get a higher and higher percentage of that initial price that you paid.  For example, if you bought JNJ 20 years ago, you would be making 30% in dividends off of that money.<br>  <br>  The stocks you want to invest in depends on how risk averse you are.  If you want to have consistent dividends, then JNJ or PG are for you (although PG has been going down a bit lately, which makes me want to buy it in a while!)<br>  <br>  If you want to be more risky, you can invest in solid companies that are "cyclical" or follow the business cycle.  These are financials, autos etc.  They are down a lot now in the recession, but may recover well when the economy recovers.  But be very careful in financials and autos now because the governement may decide to nationalize some of them, which basically means the government buys them and the shareholders all go to zero.  They may issue new stock, but all previous stock holders will forever be at zero.  Bank of America and Citigroup may be nationalized although no one knows at this point.  The safest financials appear to be Wells Fargo or JPMorgan.  The government is deciding now what to do with GM, Ford, and Chrysler, so wait to see what happens with that.  Out of those three, Ford seems to be doing the best.  Having said this, I think there are better and safer investments out there than autos and banks.  <br>  <br>  Since you don't know much about stocks, you might want to diversify even though it's only $500.  That way you won't lose it if you make the wrong decision.  So buy one or two shares of a few stocks that sound good to you and see how it goes.  But don't get scared if they fall - we are still in a recession.  You must be patient.  Long term buys are more successful than short term ones.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that buying and selling stocks have commission fees.  If you buy through Scottrade, it is $7 a trade.  If you want a full service broker (who basically tells you how to invest) it can be as much as 1% or more.  I'd advise not going with that, it's too much money.  <br>  <br>  Look at Yahoo Finance or Google Finance to see statistics for a stock and the price chart history, as well as the current stock price.<br>  <br>  Stocks with low PEGs are the best (if they are low that means that you are not paying too much for them and they also have good growth potential).  A PEG under 1 is recommended, but there are some good quality stocks that are above 1 such as JNJ.<br>  <br>  I'd advise investing in dividend stocks versus non-dividend paying stocks.  Stocks without dividends are assumed to be such high growth stocks (such as Google) that they will reinvest the money to grow more instead of paying you a dividend.  Historically though, dividend paying stocks end up with better returns for the investor since you get the dividend and any stock upside percentage.<br>  <br>  Some sites that are good are TheStreet.com, the forbes .com, morningstar.com<br>  <br>  There are so many concepts in stock investing and unfortunately I have yet to find a place that has it all in one place.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Put that money in a savings account until you understand stocks.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.investopedia.com/</a>|`|5HLlzI5Jaa	If you are serious to invest, you can google for HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent profits!

AA11284831	You need to contact the bank that operates the ATM machine.  If there was an error on the ATM machine, they will know about it and will be able to refund your money to you.<br>  <br>  ATM machines keep electronic and paper trail records of all transactions.  This includes a physical count of the actual number of notes dispensed with each transaction.  Any time there is a mismatch between the withdrawal requested and the actual number of notes dispensed, the machine goes into error mode and will not accept any further transactions until it is serviced.  Most also keep a video record of all transactions.<br>  <br>  Bring the receipt from the ATM machine showing the amount of money dispensed to any branch of the bank that operates the ATM machine.  They will investigate the matter and if there was a machine failure they will cover your losses.  If you don't have the ATM receipt, bring the card that you used with you.  They will need to know the date and approximate time of the transaction but they can work from your card to find the problem.
e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Absolutely.   Here in the USA, you can sue anyone for anything.   Will you win?  Dunno.  But unless you have a really, really strong case, any attorney is going to ask for ten thousand dollars up front, as a retainer, for the lawsuit.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes , but you need proof and it is tricky.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	You can always sue.  Whether or not you win will depend on what state you live in, and the circumstances of the termination.  In most cases, employment is "at will" for both the employer and the employee.  This means you can quit at any time for any reason, and they can fire you at any time.  A company is at risk for a lawsuit if their reason for firing you is for discriminatory reasons - meaning if you are minority, over 40, have a disability, have a protected status such as you are a member of a union.  But, just because you are a member of one of these groups (called Protected Class) it doesn't mean you can't be fired.  If you violate a policy, or if they just run out of money, you can be fired.<br>  <br>  If you think you have a discrimination claim, it has to be filed within 6 months of the discriminatory act.

If you are, it is vital that you get coverage that doesn't exclude your pregnancy as a preexisting condition.  If you start a job in April, most won't cover the pregnancy.  The best option for that is to continue your coverage from your last job under COBRA.<br>  <br>  If there were more than 20 employees at your last job, you can qualify to continue your coverage their under a program called COBRA.  But, act quickly.  You only have 60 days from the date you left work to apply for this coverage.  You will have to pay the full cost of the premium, which in my case as a single person was $500 a month.  But, it continues your coverage and your pregnancy won't be excluded as a preexisting condition.  Also, if you are married, you might be able to pick up coverage under your husband's plan.  <br>  <br>  But, cover yourself first and get COBRA enrolled before the 60 day deadline.  If you find out you can get coverage from your new work, and you determine that they will cover the pregnancy, then you can drop COBRA.  But, don't drop COBRA until you are certain.  Once you drop it, you can't get it back.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

YbwDFvEaaa	If you have reasonable proof that she has these "gentlemen" in the house when no one is there, she is in breach of contract and you could potentially evict her from the house. Maybe a helpful neighbor would be willing to snap a photo? That may sound shady but it's a way to prove her negligence of the contract and help you protect your home.    If you don't want to take matters that far, try having a discussion with her regarding respect to you and the other renter. You may also be able to ammend the contract so that she will no longer be able to bring over characters of questionable nature. Check with your state's laws regarding tenants. True, this may make her unhappy and you could potentially lose her as a renter, but it sure beats putting yourself at risk to support her "dating" habits.

You're the renter, and you guys have an agreement. She said that she won't bring guys in anymore without her being there, but you have neighbors to contradict that. You are also uncomfortable with these people being brought into your house, especially with first meetings. I suggest you tell your tenant that you are uncomfortable with the men, and that if the whole 2-3 men a week thing doesn't stop, then she has 30 days to remove herself from your home. She sounds like something bad waiting to happen, and I dunno if I would be as nice as you have been. I probably would have kicked her slutty *** to the curb awhile back.

9AGTYeU7aa	Yes, a repossession will affect your credit in a negative way for about seven years. Not to mention, even if the car is repossessed, you are not off the hook. The lender will sell the car at auction and if they get less than what is owed on your car, they will go after your boyfriend for the remainder of the money.  He needs to talk to the lender and tell them that he has lost his job and see if they can help. They really don't want your car back, that is a last alternative, they just want the money you owe them, so see if you can work something out. Good luck.|`|cLtzGveRaa	If you are not already in default, most car loan companies will allow you to append one to two payments to the end of the loan.  Talk to them.

DBvjwPTcaa	Check the bid trend and closing price of the similar item. If the item is hot most likely someone or many have set a high max bid price. He or she may have activated the auto-bid function so as not to spend time watching the bid end, sometimes at e.g. at 3am in the morning. You can do this too. <br>  <br>  First, ask yourself on how much you are willing to pay for the item and set the maximum bid you can afford. <br>  Don't try to compete bid and later on regret, unless you have the money to waste and inflate the suspected unscrupulous seller earnings, they may or may not be there. It is common to find resellers for fast moving items.<br>  Some would buy the whole stock, create a small shortage and resell these at higher prices later on.<br>  <br>  Lastly, avoid bids closing on weekends or evenings as most likely more people are competing, also, note that the auto bids will most likely still be there on weekdays but at a possibly lower max value. A reseller would normally plan this strategy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	sometimes people wait by their computer when the auction comes to a close end to make sure they pull away with the item.  i recommend amazon if you ask me

K445xADnaa	NFU Equine insurance. You can insure the full amount of the horse(s) ie if the horse is worth 5,000 then your premium will reflect that price. You can insure for a minimum of ￡500 and this will cover vet bills but if the horse dies or is stolen when in your care they will only pay out the ￡500. <br>  My advice to you is insure all the horses for the true Value of each horse.

I believe that that bond tax free bond rates will get better in the long term because money will be in shorter supply and inflation will come into play.<br>  <br>  Right now, you might want to place more emphasis on maintaining your principal than avoiding taxes.

AnULq1gfaa	Money making online is not easy and will require a lot of work.  I personally started in 2005 and i am still struggling but here are few things i learned -<br>  <br>  - It's important to have your own internet real estate and start building value for it.  By internet real estate i mean a website.  It's important for you to do proper research and build a site that is able to provide service in form of product/information etc.  <br>  - Always think long run unless you just want to make quick bucks really quick.  For products, you can look at <a href="http://www.alibaba.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alibaba.com</a> and find suppliers who can dropship for you and this way all you have to do is sell the product and have the supplier ship it for you.  <br>  <br>  If you are thinking of providing information, make sure you have unique content on your site and its well optimized for seo.  For information sites, you can optmize them with Google ads or Yahoo Ads.  You can also sell text links on your site or put links to products on ebay and earn commission on them.<br>  <br>  If i was in your place, here is what i would do -<br>  1.Find a topic that i am really interested in and go to godaddy.com and find a domain that has my main keyword in it.  lets say you are interested in computer, you can go to www.godaddy.com and maybe you will find a domain computercentral.com.  Register that<br>  2. Setup a wordpress blog for that domain.  For web hosting, i recommend webhostingpad.  For  more info, check out <a href="http://www.webhostinggroup.net/web-hosting/web-hosting-pad-review/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webhostinggroup.net/web-hosti...</a><br>  3. Write 4-5 posts per day in your blog and over time increase the posting.  Your goal should be to post regularly about interesting content.  Keep doing that for few months and over time you will start seeing increase in traffic which should convert into sales, ad revenue etc.  <br>  <br>  In the end, make sure you have your own website, write good content, update your website on regular basis, optmize it for seo and have patience.|`|yyrrPLv8aa	There are many schemes but if you are looking for some investment guidance then read the tips on the website below and if you want an easy way you could invest in a trading robot which would do the trading for you it is simple, cheap and 100% productive, see live video proof of the robot in action.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DayTradingRobotPlus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DayTradingRobotPlus.com</a>|`|89nanS69aa	Earn $10, $20 ,$50 OR $100 per hour with payment proof.<br>  .<br>  Minimum Payout $75 Via Alert pay ,PayPal or Check.<br>  .<br>  <a href="http://thanujaa.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://thanujaa.blogspot.com</a>|`|Ch9TedMcaa	The only two I know that are legit are Ebay and cashcrate.|`|Nu6RvikNaa	None. <br>  <br>  There can not by a money making scheme which is simple, cheap, productive and growth oriented for participants.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	First of all sending any money without an agreement in writing was not smart. Actually sending them this money made them well aware that you do not really know what your rights are in terms of the debt.  What you did by sending that $25(and other money) was to keep resetting the Statute of Limitations, not to mention that you have no idea if it even helped your balance at all.      Since you reset the Statute of Limitations they can file suit for the entire thing.  Where if you were close to the SOL being expired you may have gotten a better deal, or if it was expired you legally would not have owed the debt at all.    Now, they are giving you a 50% discount which is about average.  You could of course write them back with a counter offer, and if you can come up with 1 payment you may get them to accept a 60% discount, but don't expect much more than that..Of course you could always try.  But DO NOT send them any more money until you have an agreement from them in writing.
NsbGM74iaa	There should be some kind of employer match but if not then you're right.  At the age of 63, you're better off keeping your money in CD's.    If there is a match then you should definitely start a 401k plan.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Try a CD or IRA instead of the 401k unless your employer matches a percentage. Good luck!|`|qiYUZ4i8aa	I would first say it is never too late to start a 401k. Second, if you are in "excellent health", you may consider applying for term insurance.  Get a few (at least three) rate quotes online; just preliminary ones, based on age and a few other factors.  Use that information to decide on whether or not it would be prudent for you to apply for and potentially purchase some kind of term life insurance.    One of the underlying questions for life insurance is whether or not the beneficiary depends on you for your income or not (i.e., insurable interest).    Besides being concerned for your wife, you may want to be concerned for you -while you are still here.  If you are 63 and in excellent health, chances are you will have 20+ years left in your life; goodness forbid you not be able to continue working too much longer; make sure you take care of yourself, too.    With that, I would say looking to term life insurance and invest whatever you can into the company 401k - AT LEAST up to what they match.    If they don't match anything, you may be better off in a high interest savings account, CD, or IRA.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	401(k) are subject to minimum distributions rules.... when you stop working or when you turn 70.5 you will have to start withdrawing the money in your 401(k). At the time of your death you will already have withdrawn most of the money. You may have some tax savings, but if the goal is to leave something for your wife, buying life insurance seems like the better option.

How is that? You are going to write Honest Reviews of certain products or personal opinion about certain topics.    Just please be honest with your reviews so that nobody will call you a scammer... or please, as an Affiliate Marketer, just be careful on selecting products to promote. Choose products that you think has been created by a good company.    This, however, may require a little time for you to understand on what product to choose.    Also, if you love watching movies, you can create a Review of some movies, then offer movie downloads or sell DVDs from Amazon and on eBay.    This however, will require you to have a very simple website.    * Joining eBay Affiliate Program is FREE.    * Joining Amazon Affiliate Program is FREE.    * Joining Clickbank Affiliate Program is FREE.    It is up to you if you want to know more about affiliate marketing... or if you want to create your own website... or to make somebody do ALL the work for you.    What's important is, you are trying to make money online from your passions (meaning, you are enjoying what you are doing...) and not trying to make money out of people....    Well, I guess, that's how you are going to make money online...    Try to figure out what you enjoy doing, share it to others, and have profits from it selling products that you DON'T virtually own. This is what I can call, FREE or EASY MONEY.    Just a piece of advice.... If you want to learn more and you don't want future problems...    STAY AWAY from Nick Marks...

R1prwIuXaa	Average daily balance is what credit card companies use to calculate finance charges.  They take the closing balance($ amount) at the end of each day and average every day together to get a general average.  They based your finance charges off of that general average.|`|mxqAOxYRaa	from what I know, a 2 month average balance is the average amount of money on your account between two months|`|qBCGH52haa	Just what it sounds like - instead of using just the most recent month's average balance (figured on a daily basis) the company uses a two month average...this penalizes people who use the card to pay things off over a short period of time.  Simple example - you charge $1000 in March planning on paying it off in four equal payments.  The first month you get the bill, it is $1,000 and you pay $250 half way through the month.  Since you still have a balance, the new balance will be $1,000 minus $250 plus interest.  Assuming 1% interest a month, the interest would be figured on $875 (your average daily balance of $1,000 for the first 15 days and $750 for the second 15 days) for interest of $8.75 and a new balance of $758.75.  No, the next month you pay an additional $258.75 (the $250 you were going to pay plus all the new interest).    Assuming you paid halfway through the month again, the interest would be on $629.38 (the average daily balance) with an interest charge of $6.29 and a new balance of $506.29 (758.75 - $258.75 + $6.29).    Now the trick, using the two month average balance, your second month's average balance becomes $752 and change with a finance charge of $7.52, so you get charged an extra $1.14 - more money for the card company this way.

That model has pretty much failed every time and its usually a group of doctors that start the hospital, not just one. Part is just the shear size of start up capital required to establish a hospital these days.  Second is the legal & regulatory procedures required.  Third is the poor state of reimbursement.  Most, if not all, hospitals run at an overall huge loss. Many docs can not longer even afford to be in private solo practice, let alone think about a solo clinic or even a hospital.  I am sure your goals will drastically change as you wind your way through the educative process to get that MD degree.

This is because they weren't 100% informed of what things that area of work would include, particularly of the struggles involved. Some people have actually incurred quite a bit of trouble because of the debt from student loans which they cannot seem to manage. Unfortunately, higher education is way over sold. <br>  <br>  If that is what you are truly interested in right now, I would suggest getting a job in a hospital as soon as possible, and work there for a few years to get an idea of what its like...ask the doctors questions...research the job you're looking at...inquire every detail from the college you plan to go to...<br>  <br>  By doing this, you will be able to test your own sincerity, which is a really beneficial tool to learn how to use.

WEhTokUjaa	Right now, in this economy, you would be lucky to get an entry level position in a low level company.<br>  <br>  Actually, you would be lucky to get any job!!!  And that is no joke!!!<br>  <br>  However, you would probably be able to get a position as a telemarketer, but, you really don't need an associates degree for this job.  The fact that you have or will soon get your associates degree does put you in an advantage over those who do not.  An employer will tend to give a job to the candidate with the highest level of education, all other factors being equal.<br>    <br>  <br>  If you are interested in finding out more about "network marketing", you can find out alot of information online.  One nice thing about network marketing is that you can have a successful career with an associates degree, or you can have a successful career with no degree at all.   You would have a distinct advantage over the non-degreed marketer, as you have a lot more knowledge at your fingertips.  You will most likely have better writing and speaking skills than someone with just a HS diploma,  a GED or equivilancy diploma, or no dipolma at all.  <br>  <br>  The difference between a network marketer and a telemarketer is that you won't have to annoy people at dinner time!  As a matter of fact, you won't have to annoy anyone at anytime, if you do network marketing right!<br>  <br>  Is Network Marketing a Get Rich Quick Scheme???  Definately not, and anyone who tells you so is not being honest with you.  <br>  So, if continuing you education is not an option at this time, then send out your resume.  If you have any type of experiance, a lot of employers will also take that into consideration.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in finding out how to break into the network marketing arena, please check out my website, www.top-network-marketing-companies.org<br>  <br>  I am not going to SELL you on my NWM or MLM company, don't worry about that.  What my website is about is helping you to find the "right" network marketing opportunity for "you" and how to develop that opportinity into a successful career.  One requirement is access to a computer with high speed internet access.  The good news is that most school libraries give you unlimited access at the library!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

IRtPNXK5aa	I concur with Reena; they will not take or tap into your 401(K). Cashing it out or drawing a hardship payment will be counted as income and will subject to to year end taxes and possible penalties (see your administrator more information)...you will have to declare the current value of your retirement, but it remains yours...|`|MbzyriZ4aa	No.... at least not as long as it is an "active" 401k that is still held by your employer and you are not "cashing it out".
A8frjLzuaa	It depends.  Did you have mortages lates or did you just have to sell?  If you had mortgage lates, then your credit is trashed.  If you didn't, then you credit probably wan't hit too bad (75 points-ish).  Under new Fannie guidelines, a person who had a short sale and no mortgage lates can immediately apply for a new loan and receive the same interest rate as if the short sale didn't happen.  Otherwise, if your credit is crap, the standard waiting period was 2 years before being able to buy again.  But new guidelines are pushing it down to 18 months.  But don't worry...homes won't be going up anytime soon and you should have plenty to choose from in 8 months or 2 years.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Probably not going to happen in less than three years.  A short sale will trash your credit as badly as will a foreclosure.  It is a MAJOR failure to fulfill financial obligations as agreed.<br>  <br>  Your score won't be of much help.  As soon as a potential lender sees 'short sale' on your credit file, that will be as far as it looks.  Your application will be curtly denied.|`|1b53c1d569926853d838aa950b76febbaa	3 years under current guidelines. FHA would be your best bet.
AA10305589	When you apply for unemployment, the unemployment office contacts your last employer to see if they want to contest your claim.  If the company wants to contest, they can inform unemployment that they did offer you a job, which you declined - that would make you ineligible.  However, if they decide not to contest it, then there would be no problem. In this situation it depends on your relationship with the company and how they want to handle it.  In some cases, it is not worth the company's time and expense to contest, so they don't bother.  I suggest that you go ahead and apply, and wait to see what the company does.  You may be declined, but if you don't apply, you definitely won't collect.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	It sounds like you applied to places different than your employer, that makes it a different story. Most states require that while on disability the employer either hold your position or provide one of equal value/responsibility when you return. Sometimes it is not feasible to leave the position open, so they just have to give you a job. It sounds like someone mis spoke that did not know the law and they back peddled.<br>  <br>  You need to contact a state representative in the disability office and see what the law states. In New Jersey, this can not occur. Elsewhere, it may be legal. <br>  <br>  If she offers another position at the same pay and you decline, than you quit and receive no unemployment insurance. Do not say no, be gracious and accept the position. You will be luck to have  a job.|`|AHCelSY1aa	You should have written for how long you have been at this place.  It appears they are totally shaking in there boots because they may have committed an employment illegality...|`|HUF5nZSuaa	Some employers would pull something like that. If anything let them lay you off and you can get welfare and unemployment. and welfare also has Medicaid. But he should just really focus on getting better and not let those people get to you. You can find a better job. Also if you your health insurance dismisses you, your job is suppose to send you paper work on COBRA. But hang in there, things can only get better. And if you need extra cash you should check out this website. It has been helping me out the past couple of months since i was laid off. And you dont have to put any money in to get started you should check it out.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	If you work in the US I can try to help you on this.  <br>  <br>  #1 did you get injured at work?  If yes then they have to hold your position for you, if after 12 months you are not able to return to full duty they can terminate your employment.<br>  <br>  #2 If you were not injured at work and you company offers STD and you are on this then they can not terminate your employment while still in the window for STD, if the company has more than 20 employees you also qualify for FMLA.  FMLA will protect your job for an additional 12 weeks durning a rolling year, not to be used in conjunction with STD.  After the 12 weeks they can give your position to someone else but still should keep you on as an employee for up to 6mths, on an unpaid medical leave.  After that your company may have a policy that allows you to be on a unpaid medical leave for up to 12 mths total, that is based on your companys policies.  <br>  <br>  You may also qualify for American w/ Disabilities Act and if this is the case call you local EEOC office and file a complaint.
eACZ1Rhjaa	No, sorry you need to deal with it. The court would take longer to lower the garnishment than it will take to get it done. We have some people being garnished for much more than 25% one is his entire paycheck some weeks. Child support is about 40% for some people but garnishment is the only way some debts get paid and it would be even harder to collect if you had to do it slower. In 5 weeks this will be done so you just have to find another way to pay bills. Maybe your parents can loan you a couple of hundred to make it easier.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Chances are low that this can be changed in time to be of much good for you.  A garnishment action is court ordered and your employer must comply with the order.  For you to change the order, you need to contact the courts which ordered the garnishment and make some sort of plea for a reduction in the amount taken.  By the time you get a court appearance scheduled, you will have already paid off the amount due.|`|nnkeYZqZaa	<a href="http://answeringall.mooretolife.net" rel="nofollow">http://answeringall.mooretolife.net</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|gayccFaZaa	Get your doubts about Credit Card program procedure solved here. <a href="http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com</a>
MbzyriZ4aa	Nothing... <br>  <br>  The rescue is mainly to keep our banks afloat for a while longer.<br>  Eventually that won't work anymore and then we can finally clean<br>  up the mess and if we don't realize this soon... we will end up like<br>  Japan that lost a whole decade... about 7 bail-outs later.|`|BUvvstsjaa	If you can afford to wait to find out, good for you.  You might have to end up getting back out in the work field.  A little money is better than no money.
