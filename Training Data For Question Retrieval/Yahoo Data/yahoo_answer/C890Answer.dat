I take it you have really good grades in school and that you got an apprenticeship to work at such an early age. Keep your grades up in school, and keep working hard. Save as much of the money as you can, and don't spend it on frivalous things!|`|jLL7sDILaa	That's more than I've ever been paid. You're underage and getting more than minimum wage. Count yourself lucky.|`|jPalFlteaa	Yes.  That is more than minimum wage.  Of course you don't tell us what kind of restaurant, if you get tips, or where you live.|`|3iOwkyrnaa	Your underage. <br>  And thats much more than most people at the legal age get paid.<br>  Good for you.
suSWUm5Jaa	Yes it works. Been using it for months and the results are amazingly constant. <br>  Notice, though, that you must have some basic prior knowledge. You will not just turn it on and that's it! I guess that is the fine line between those who say it is a scam and those who can show good to great results. The good thing, once it is all set up and you have a routine, is that the income is constant. Bottom line: it is worth trying, as your cousin told you.|`|znnw5qfkaa	Christian, the system works! You have nothing to lose anyway since you can ask your money back. But really, THIS ONE works!|`|3QdmRvL0aa	If it were so awesome why isn't everyone using it?|`|AA10302607	It's a scammmm.|`|NQoyw4T5aa	First off, I don't take links on the YA site, many of which are scams and dangerous.<br>  <br>  The "bot" that you mentioned is not necessarily a scam, but mechanical systems are notorious for being successful in certain markets and bad in other markets. Any system can have a good run. Another weakness for such systems is that they can have significant drawdowns even if they eventually prove their worth. Your account might go down 30 percent although if you keep with the system you may make a solid 20 percent a year. But when your account is down, you may be sweating bullets and you probably won't stay with the system.<br>  <br>  You will not get a refund, regardless of what the sellers claim. Sellers can tweak their stats to prove their systems were good. Read the fine print of those guarantees carefully. You'll probably be required to keep records of all your trades and/or all the theoretical trades.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd stay away. There are a million such systems out there. I'm not remotely intersted in this one. I've been around a long time.|`|ohvo1VOMaa	I actually bought the program last month. Saw an ad on E*Trade. <br>  It took me about 2 weeks to get going but since then, I have made more than $200 average per day. So I am living proof that it can work. Why do I say, "it CAN work"? Because I have prior knowledge of day trading and it helps to know how day trading works! That's obvious but I wanted to make that clear. So anyway, you may want to give it a shot. You have nothing to lose. If it does not work for you, you ask you money back.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	It sounds too good to be true.<br>  <br>  <br>  So it probably is.

If you go through and Agency then you have no chance, like wise if you have been declared Bankrupt you will have to inform the lettings agent and then your application will not get far !!  Yes you will have to find any deposit unless you are an exceptional case and require emergency housing but then the Dept will liaise with the file of landlords they have but you will need to prove very good reason as to why you need their help.|`|AA11349925	Deposit (equal to first months rent)  first months rent plus what ever fees the estate agents slap on top of that.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Theoretically, under the current scheme, you'd be treated the same as any other private tenant - generally, you put down a bond, and pay this month's rent in advance. The only difference is that you'd be paying it out of your LHA rather than your salary. Whether it works like that in practice is another matter.<br>  <br>  (The LHA was meant to give DSS tenants the same choice in housing as other private tenants, but to be honest I don't think that would be the case unless they made it illegal for landlords to say "No DSS", just as they made it illegal to say "No Irish, No Blacks" in the 1960s.)

The first step is to search for at least ten popular, free blog websites. Those related to your niche market are the best bet. Some of the ones you may want to check out are: blogger.com, wordpress.com, livejournal.com, squarespace.com, eagent.com, real-estate-blogs.com, houseblogger.typepad.com, realestateweblog.org, find-a-real-estate-agent.net, activerain.com, and condo.com to name just a few. Conversely, you can do a web search on your own and choose from the thousands of free on-line sites dedicated to Real Estate Blogs.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Record each website in a journal. Make sure you record the password you used to sign into the blog and the URL to your personal blog from each individual site. You should include important keywords in the blog URL (for example – if you operate a real estate company out of Las Vegas your blog URL might be …thenameyouchoose/las-vegas-real-estate-... You should create similar records for each of the sites you have chosen. Keep these records in a word processing file such as MS Word or Notepad so you can easily copy and paste them when necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Next, create ten 500 to 1000 keyword-rich articles related to your chosen blog URL (e.g.: Las Vegas Real Estate). A good rule of thumb is to have one keyword per each 100 words in your articles. To simplify things, these instructions are based on your article being 500 words, with the chosen keyword mentioned at least 5 times.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Now, log-in to the first blog account you created and paste one of the articles in that blog. Be sure to create links back to your website on at least half of the chosen keywords and links back to the URL of one of the free blog accounts you set up as outlined in step one with at least 2 of the remaining selected keywords.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Repeat this process on each of the free blog sites using a different article each time. Then, go onto your own website where you will create one link to one of the blogs using the keyword of your choice. It is only necessary to create 1 link from your site as the search bots will follow that link, which will bring them to the first blog where they will then follow that link to the blog you previously linked there and move onward from there.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Next, go to feedburner.com where you can submit the RSS URL’s one at a time in feedburner. After you have submitted all your chosen sites you should click onto pingoat.com where you can submit the URL from your blog sites. It really isn’t necessary to submit the RSS URL, however should you decide to do so, you can also add the RSS URL on pingoat; however, you have to select that option from a drop-down menu.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Finally, sit back and monitor either the stats program provided by your site host or you can do your monitoring through Google Analytics. It may take anywhere from one month to six weeks for the search engines to rank your site, but once they begin zipping from one of your created links to another, be prepared to be totally amazed. Your site will achieve major rankings because the major search engines consider top blog sites to be authority web sites.<br>  <br>  <br>  There really is no reason for you to stop there. Continue your campaign on as many blog sites as you like. The results are sure to be awesome and you will have to agree that this traffic generation method is one sure way to promote traffic to your site. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As an added bonus, by utilizing the above traffic generation system, you can also supplement your income stream. By registering with Google’s Adsense program, where you can integrate ads into any or all the free blogs you’ve signed up with you may be able to pick up a little extra coin for your efforts.<br>  <br>  <br>  As with any other internet marketing technique, results are indicative of the amount of effort put into promotion and development of a good idea. This method of traffic generation may initially take a little planning and development on your part, but it is well worth the time and effort. <br>  Developing a niche market over the Internet is only the first step to success. Savvy marketers know that in order to remain competitive in such a volatile and versatile market they must be willing to embrace any and all avenues designed to augment their chances of overwhelming success. <br>  If you like the above tip (and I’m convinced you will), there is one way you can be sure to have consistent access to a myriad of other helpful hints and tips.

But bear in mind they might not be hiring, due to the economic downturn.  Just say you worked there in the past (give the dates worked & state who your immediate boss was) and you would be very happy to return during the summer if they have any positions available.  Then state what tasks you performed there & any successes that you had with them (like improving something or meeting deadlines, etc - it's hard for me to give an example as I know nothing about a sawmill!).  Mention that you enjoyed the company of your work colleagues.  Then finish off with your contact details & say something like I look forward to hearing from you.  If you don't get a reply then contact the old boss you used to have or anyone in management there & just call them & ask for work.  I assume the new employee you are talking about is the new HR manager?  You don't have to contact him, you can just send it to the general management there, especially if they know you & will remember you.  They can recommend hiring you even if the HR manager doesn't want to.

vVTmJjJDaa	i haven't taken the AARP course online...however, i *have* attended the defensive driver course in person - two days of *four hours* at a time (with one 10 minute break) - i thought i'd lose it...and it wasn't even for point reduction - it was simply to save a few bucks on my car insurance...i'll never do that again...i'd rather pay more for my insurance - *that* is how unbearable it was...<br>  <br>  however, after going to the AARP website and reading how it works, there are *definite* advantages to taking it online, vs attending a class in person - here are the top advantages:<br>  <br>  "Self-paced and interactive" - it only goes as fast as you want, you can take breaks whenever you want, and it's very likely to not be nearly as boring - because instead of just a viewing video and then having the instructor blab away to the class, you are actually able to answer various questions during your online sessions...for instance, they might show a short video and then ask "what would you do?" - then you'd choose answer A, B, C or D - and then they'd go on to tell you what the best way to handle the situation would be and why.<br>  <br>  "Round-the-clock customer support available by phone and email while you take the course." - this is great because in case you get stuck, have a question, or a technical problem, they can help you out - either instantly over the phone, or via email - whichever is more convenient for you.<br>  <br>  "Simple online registration" - if you attend classes in person, you have to pre-register by finding a listing of available locations and dates, and then calling ahead of time to see if a spot is available - and then either mail in a check ahead of time, or bring a check or cash with you to the first session and fill out a registration form by hand.  whereas, online, all you have to do is type in your name and address, input your AARP number (if you're a member - if not, it only costs $4.00 more), and then pay for it instantly with a credit card.  <br>   <br>  "30-day timeframe in which to complete the course." - this is the best advantage by far - you have a full THIRTY DAYS in which to complete the course - therefore, unlike attending classes in person, where you usually only have the choice of either two 4-hour sessions, or one DAY LONG session (omg, i can't even imagine that), you have much more flexibility as to how much time you want to devote to it on any given day within those 30 days - therefore, you could very likely spend as little as 15 minutes a day on it, and complete the entire course way before the 30 days are up.<br>  <br>  when my defensive driver credit runs out, i'm definitely taking the course online!<br>  <br>  good luck. :)|`|aJGAXYUIaa	no

If those figures tell you that you are not ready, they will let you know what numbers you need to have to be ready.  Taxes and any home improvements have to be taken into consideration.  A realtor is paid out of the sale of the home.  Your realtor and the seller's realtor have to split their commission out of the sale. If you put in an offer on a home, you wil need to pay for a home inspection prior to acceptance.  If there are serious problems with the structure or other features of the home, the home seller can be asked to pay for them, you can refuse to pursue the home, or you and the seller can agree on a lower price so you can afford to fix the problems.  Landscaping a home requires equipment purchases to maintain the property and routine purchases of mulch or stone and plantings to enhance the exterior.  Are the windows in the home vinyl or wood?  Wood is high maintenance, vinyl is no maintenance. What is the exterior siding?  Vinyl again is no maintenance as is stucco.  Work strongly with your lender and your realtor.  Whether a new home buyer or a seasoned home buyer you need good help to guide you.

Other important qualities include the ability to analyze technical data in suppliers’ proposals; good communication, negotiation, and mathematical skills; knowledge of supply-chain management; and the ability to perform financial analyses.<br>  <br>  People who wish to become wholesale or retail buyers should be good at planning and decisionmaking and have an interest in merchandising. Anticipating consumer preferences and ensuring that goods are in stock when they are needed requires resourcefulness, good judgment, and self-confidence. Buyers must be able to make decisions quickly and to take risks. Marketing skills and the ability to identify products that will sell also are very important. Employers often look for leadership ability, too, because buyers spend a large portion of their time supervising assistant buyers and dealing with manufacturers’ representatives and store executives.<br>  <br>  Experienced buyers may advance by moving to a department that manages a larger volume or by becoming a merchandise manager. Others may go to work in sales for a manufacturer or wholesaler.<br>  <br>  Certification and advancement.

At the top levels, duties may overlap with other management functions, such as production, planning, logistics, and marketing.<br>  <br>  Regardless of industry, continuing education is essential for advancement. Many purchasing managers, buyers, and purchasing agents participate in seminars offered by professional societies and take college courses in supply management. Professional certification is becoming increasingly important, especially for those just entering the occupation.<br>  <br>  There are several recognized credentials for purchasing agents and purchasing managers. The Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) designation is conferred by the Institute for Supply Management. In 2008, this certification will be replaced by the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) credential, covering the wider scope of duties now performed by purchasing professionals. The Certified Purchasing Professional (CPP) and Certified Professional Purchasing Manager (CPPM) designations are conferred by the American Purchasing Society. The Certified Supply Chain Professional credential is conferred by APICS, the Association for Operations Management. For workers in Federal, State, and local government, the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing offers the designations of Certified Professional Public Buyer (CPPB) and Certified Public Purchasing Officer (CPPO). Most of these certifications are awarded only after work-related experience and education requirements are met and written or oral exams are successfully completed. <br>  <br>  Marketing and Writing are two different, specialized occupations.

If the market is at 10 and you then sell the stock, you get 10, for a net of 0 - 1.10.  A call is only worth something if the market price is above the strike price and you can but at 10 and sell for market.  <br>  <br>  Now if there is a lot of time remaining in the option, then the option may be worth more than 1.10 and you can sell the option to somebody else and make money that way.  Nobody cares what the market price was you bought the option.  If you want to profit from a move from 5.56 to 10 then you have to buy the stock.
yO5tm6e1aa	You've indicated you have a promissory note.  If this is correct, then it's in written form, inclusive of the date, amount of the loan, and the terms of the loan... and signed by your friend.  So, assuming you have a real promissory note, then you should now hire a collections agency.  Here is some information on one:<br>  <a href="http://www.nrs.us/when_to_hire_collection_agency.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrs.us/when_to_hire_collectio...</a><br>  <br>  This is also a lesson I learned a couple/few decades ago.  Never directly lend money you're counting on seeing again.  There are other ways to lend the money where you "secure" the loan, but the invoicing and payments are handled by a banking institution.  Now days, you can do this via web hosts like <a href="http://www.prosper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prosper.com/</a>|`|Saul1Bhuaa	In our world, nobody owes anyone anything until a court says they do.

Say like a signed agreement or a check statement. Your (so-called) friend can also admit that you gave it to him. If not it's just your word against his. So before you do anything come with some kind of evidence. Try to get him to admit it through a e-mail then save it.|`|NExIpyWRaa	You can sue but you can also write off $3000 on your taxes each year as a bad debt untill the loan is written off. This would become income that the person who owes you would have to claim on their taxes. You could take the deduction and let the IRS deal with him if he doesnt declare the taxable income. Sadly deducting it on the taxes still leaves you out money but it may cost more to go through the courts to get a judgment and then there is the possibility they could declare BK before you get the judgment. I would write it off on my taxes for the next 17 years and consider it lesson learned if you dont want to shell out the money and time to go through the courts. Call a certified financial planner for the deduction option or a lawyer to sue but you do have several options. Good luck and dont lend money to anyone.

Greed is not good, and the officers of the financial and motor companies are finding out.  In the past 20 years the disparity between the executives and the employees has become so vast that it had to come to light.  For instance the company I work for is a prime example of executive greed.  Four years ago our company (airline industry) approached bankruptcy.  Our executives asked the employees to take pay cuts to help the company get out of the financial situation they had basically put us in.  My workgroup took a 30% pay cut.  Since that time the executives have taken multi million dollar bonuses and we have seen nothing.  Greed, is what will take capitalism down.

The financial situation globally is expected to stabilise in 18 to 24 months. Till such time the pressure on gold will be on.

4VsUKjQGaa	First, your daughter is definitely a child for 2008 taxes.  A newborn is considered to have lived the entire year.<br>  <br>  Then, there are a bunch of very obscure rules.  First, if you can BE a dependent, then you cannot HAVE a dependent.  Also, if you ARE a qualifying child, then you cannot HAVE a qualifying child.  But, you can be a dependent and have a qualifying child.  <br>  <br>  So, first question:  Are you a qualifying child?  Did you live with either of your folks or grandparents or aunts or uncles for more than half the year?  If not, you're not a qualifying child, so you can have a qualifying child.<br>  <br>  If yes, did you provide more than half of your own support?  Support includes your share of the rent, the utilities, the groceries, your clothes, transportation, medical expenses, entertainment... everything except savings.  If you provided more than half of your support, then you are a qualifying child ONLY for EIC--not for anything else.  So, you can claim head-of-household (if you provided more than half the costs of maintaining the baby's home), you can claim the baby's exemption and the child tax credit.<br>  <br>  If you lived more than half the year with relatives and didn't provide more than half of your own support, then they can claim you as a qualifying child.  Since you cannot have a qualifying child if you are a qualifying child, the only tax benefit you get is head-of-household (assuming you paid more than half the cost of the baby's home).<br>  <br>  The last scenario would be that you didn't live with relatives but didn't support yourself either.  Then, you would be a dependent.  You could not claim your daughter's dependency exemption, but you could claim head-of-household, earned income credit and the child tax credit (using form 8901).<br>  <br>  Of course, if you lived independently and supported yourself, then you can claim everything.<br>  <br>  I know that's confusing, but try to walk yourself through each paragraph and determine which situation fits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|02fbb4641d7549de08946f8490ae69bfaa	If you are claimable as a dependent then you cannot claim your child even if no one claims you as a dependent.<br>  <br>  You are claimable as a qualifying child if you lived with a close relative (parent, sibling, uncle, aunt) for more than six months and you did not provide over half of your own support.<br>  <br>  You are claimable as a qualifying relative if you had income less than $3,500, you lived with another person for 12 months in 2008 and that person provided over half of your own support.<br>  <br>  If neither of these situations applies to you, then you can claim your child on your own tax return for 2008.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Not on 2008 taxes but next year you can

L4rlu2BDaa	Yes some companies will freeze interest, but you need to write to them explain that you can't afford the current minimum payment and would like to come to an arrangement with them to stop any interest and any charges to your account if you pay ￡x each month. You have to keep to this repayment though, if you don't they will start putting interest back on again.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	No, it isn't as you agreed to the terms and conditions when you signed up for the card...get in touch with them and ask them to agree a payment plan with you..., yes I'm afraid it'll affect your credit rating if you default on payments.|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	You can't stop paying the interest.   Even if they deferred it for a while it is still ticking away.|`|SzF35901aa	It is possible to negotiate with the company to agree reduced payments and stop interest, but that doesn't mean it is easy.  They exist to make money and the interest you pay is how they do it. Ultimately they want to be paid what you owe, but they will negotiate if they believe you really can't pay the full amount and that they will be better off getting something from you rather than nothing.<br>  <br>  They will not agree if they think you can afford it but just don't want to pay.  You need to prepare a Financial Statement to provide proof of what you can and can't afford.  You can get help online with this (see link below).  Once you know what you really can afford, you write to them with your statement and an offer of payment.<br>  <br>  The alternative of course is to transfer your balance to a new card with a 0% interest offer.|`|jS5O0LaUaa	Yes if you go to Citizens Advice they will get in touch with them and stop the interest and agreeee terms of payment you must pay whats agreed or if you miss payments they will put interest back on|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Yes, pay off your balance or transfer to another card that has a 0% introductory rate (3% balance transfer fee usually applies).

Other clauses to be included in the memorandum depend on the type of company being incorporated. We will advise you on this if necessary. Our standard memorandum covers most business types so you will be able to trade without restriction, however you should take professional legal advice if concerned. <br>  <br>  What are the Articles of Association?<br>  This document sets out the rules for the internal running of the company, governing the rights and duties of the members of a company among themselves. Articles deal with internal matters such as general meetings, appointment of directors, issue and transfer of shares, dividends, accounts and audit.

OK I will assume you have checked that out.  <br>                                Now you talk about 2 years time, who knows?<br>            My guess is that house prices will steady out over the next few months, maybe drop a tad more in the very short term, but very short term.  So do it now!! Before the prices start to rocket again.

It's how their owners run them and market them that makes the difference between success and failure.  Whatever you do, make sure that your target market knows that you do it and that they have a compelling reason to choose you to do it for them.<br>  <br>  Never worry too much about a market being overcrowded.  It's a good sign.  It means that there's a demand for the product or service.  Your idea of aiming at a particular niche is what sets you apart from the generalists and helps you draw in regular business.  As a specialist in X niche, you'll win their business more readily than a company that caters for everyone who needs leaflet distribution.<br>  <br>  If you're going to franchise your business, make sure you have systems in place for everything you do.  That means that it's easy to sell it as a franchise because everything you do can be replicated.<br>  <br>  If you're in the UK, speak to your local Business Link for help in starting up and for advice on franchising your business.<br>  <br>  Good luck, Ash!|`|f0UUDedkaa	Do your thorough researchon good ol' Internet.<br>  <br>  A brick and mortar leaflet/franchising will cost a lot of money and time.

It's still a business and the 90% failure rate still applies. Again, research like you've never researched before!<br>  <br>  If somebody else tries to plug you a network marketing opportunity, IMMEDIATELY SAY NO. Not because it's a scam, mainly beasue there is 97% chances that the person trying to plug you that opportunity is not using a system. There will be 97% chances that once you get in, you will have to make a dumb list of friends and family, that will sour your mlm experience so fast, believe me.<br>  <br>  I found one of many websites about franchising, quite frankly, I just googled "franchising tips" for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wsicorporate.com/article/Franchise_your_business_tips_2008" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsicorporate.com/article/Fran...</a><br>  <br>  Should you try Internet marketing and work with your computer, you have to follow these 9 steps:  <br>  <br>  1- Harness the power of a CAPTURE PAGE.<br>  <br>  A capture page incorporates EMOTIONAL and APPEALING copywriting to guide your visitor to the desired action.<br>  <br>  Your message will be understood faster if you use VIDEO.<br>  <br>  It funnels them to one choice and one choice only: TO BECOME A LEAD, no hard selling.<br>  <br>  2- You are personally BRANDED in your prospect's mind.<br>  <br>  It establishes you as a leader, as someone with value to offer.<br>  <br>  A marketing funnel lets your prospects begin to feel like they know you so the relationship begins to build.<br>  <br>  Again, video is by far the best way to do this.<br>  <br>  3- You are building your own EMAIL LIST.<br>  <br>  You will be able to market to this list for the rest of time and recruit on auto-pilot.<br>  <br>  You can build relationships with thousands of people at the push of a button.<br>  <br>  You can offer all sorts of various products and income streams in addition to your main opportunity.

Focus on sponsoring leaders you are building relationship with through you lead generation.<br>  <br>  Let automated marketing system work on selling all the prospects who don't join but still need the tools or other networkers you're marketing to.<br>  <br>  8- Interact, learn and grow from being part of an interactive community.<br>  <br>  Be an active member of strong communities to not only develop far more relations but to learn from all the other smart people in these communities.<br>  <br>  Focus on adding value to peoples lives and you can build tremendous followings of people within communities.<br>  <br>  Generate immediate exposure for yourself and business through networking with people in communities.<br>  <br>  9- Continue to get advanced training and knowledge to always be ahead of the pack.<br>  <br>  Education is the biggest money-making activity there is next to implementing that education.<br>  <br>  Without knowledge or learned new skill sets, you can never increase the amount of money you earn.

She did a show on Saturday and earned $135 for 3 hours of work! It is commissioned based though, but you get free jewelry and credits for selling the jewelry. The jewelry is costume jewelry, but they are BEAUTIFUL pieces. I have a few!<br>  <br>  You could also sell Pampered Chef products. It's just like Lia Sophia, except you sell really cool, high quality kitchen products. I've ordered products from a party before and am still very happy with them. Go to the website and check them out!<br>  <br>  The best thing about these little businesses are that you do all the work at home and you set the times that you want to work. My sister-in-law works on Saturdays and makes good money!<br>  <br>  I actually posted this same question and someone told me about this website called CashCrate. You get money for filling out surveys. I read some articles about it and the only catch is that they make you jump through hoops to get paid and your inbox gets flooded with spam. I guess you could fix that with an alternate 'spam' email address. <br>  <br>  I've put some links to articles about CashCrate below.

b5ed16c940be1868f0aa615afa8d8e15aa	Sorry, military or not, I have no sympathy for you. Calling CNN if the lender won't work with you, per the previous respondent's post, is just overboard. Let's be honest -- you chose to purchase a home at a time when home values where dropping, the mortgage meltdown was kicking up (if not already in full swing), and there was no end in sight. You apparently also did this with NO guarantee you'd be in that area for an extended period of time. You didn't want to "throw money away" on rent, but had you done your homework, you'd have probably realized you'd be throwing money away by purchasing a home. I'm sorry if this is sounds harsh, it's not that I'm not sympathetic, but I'm a little frustrated, as a renter, as somebody who is and will be penalized for bad behavior on the part of others :P<br>  <br>  Probably not what you want to hear, but the best thing you can do is rent it out. Somebody on base may be able to help/guide you through the process, or refer you to a property management firm that works with the enlisted. You have money coming in, the mortgage gets paid, nobody's credit is dinged, and perhaps you can sell it at a profit (or a lesser loss) when values come back up.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	I remember seeing something in the latest stimulus bill before it was railroaded through the legislature about military housing, which might have addressed that.

So I just glanced at that on my way past that part to see if there was anything useful to the general public.<br>  <br>  I have not looked to see if there is a final version of the bill somewhere with searchable text.  But if you can find one, search it for "military".|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	First off, it you are legally married, any hit to his credit affects yours.  Next you need to contact your lender immediately and let them know what is happening with your reassignment. If they don't work with you to get out of this loan, I would contact CNN and any other media outlet you can get to listen to you.  I would get the property listed right away.  Maybe sure to interview Realtors who have someone working with them that has experience negotiating with lenders. Not just one Realtor who has handled a few short sales or foreclosures. You want someone who has real experience and ask for a list of the properties they have handled.  I know this is a lot of homework, but it's in your best interests to cover all the bases.  No pun intended. <br>  <br>  Do everything you can even it means you may have to stop one step after it's begun.  Just make sure you have the best answer for you and your family first and foremost.   <br>  <br>  I'm sure your lender will work with you in this situation.

Similarly, mortgages are granted by deed. These deeds set out what is being sold/mortgaged and details all the covenants, easements, charges etc. In the old system of unregistered land all these deeds would be kept and would be used to prove ownership, by tracing the history of transactions to prove that the current owner is legitimate. If you mortgaged the house the lender would keep the deeds because that prevented you selling or remortgaging the house without their consent.<br>  <br>  However, most land is now registered, and it certainly will be if it has been sold or mortgaged since 1990. In registered land details of ownership, and charges such as mortgages, are held at the Land Registry. This register is definitive, so there is no longer any need to store "deeds" for the property. The register includes details of mortgages, which is enough protection for the lender. <br>  <br>  You still have to use a deed when you buy, sell or mortgage, but once that transaction is complete and registered, the deed has no further use.<br>  <br>  If you have the historic deeds for your house it is probably because they were returned to you after the property was first registered. They may be of academic interest, but they no longer have any legal significance. However, if you are thinking of getting rid of them it would be a good idea to double check that your house is correctly registered first.|`|77e6898bd9a238be8d8f80eb6caf1eb4aa	I had a similar issue a few years ago, and it was purely because the lender didn't want to pay for the storage of the documents.

Property is registered with the land registry and your mortgage provider will have put a charge on your property - which will be removed once you repay the mortgage.

I agree that home prices will probably drop a little more before they start to go back up but, first of all, we live in mid-America, where the housing crisis hasn't been as bad as on the east and west coasts and, secondly, we plan on staying here a very long time so, even though the costs may drop a bit more, they'll be back up again long before we ever decide to sell.  I personally would not have wanted to wait until the economy starts to turn back around before I started home-shopping......it took me 2 years of looking to find this place so if I had waited until things started picking back up, by the time I found what I wanted it would be priced too high!

(You may have to be a member to apply but you will need to pay on your prepaid card with either a check or online, anyhow, where the money is deducted from a bank account)<br>  <br>  You did not mention any money to open the prepaid card account? And, it would take way more than 3 or 4 days to receive the card, so either you are confused as to what a prepaid credit card is and how it works, or you have a checking account and have already done a debit for the amount the prepaid card was suppose to be maxed at? I hope not, as this could have been a scam.<br>  <br>  A prepaid credit card, also called a "secured" credit card, works like this:<br>  You apply for a certain amount, let's say $500. You give the card company $500 to hold and use as collateral (in case you don't pay on the loan). Then you use the card to charge on up to your $500 limit. You make monthly payments on the amounts charged, which can be as low as $18, and include 8 1/2% interest. (This is what my prepaid VISA card cost through my credit union). Most onlinesources are very expensive, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  You say you have chosen which card you wanted. When you apply through a bank or credit union, they use one certain card for their service and you do not get to choose.<br>  <br>  Prepaid credit cards are mainly for those of us who cannot get a regular credit card on their own for various reasons. They can be used to upgrade and improve the looks of your credit report, adding more to your score and  showing your ability to pay on the card, even though it will say it is a secured card.<br>  <br>  This is not like the "secured" cards I am familiar with which can help boost your credit rating. I do know places like Rit-Aid Pharmacy sells these that you have to activate but I do not believe they are reported on your credit report. I would doubt they are of any help for a credit report as they do not check your rating to apply for it. <br>  <br>  Thanks for the extra, added info about the card you applied for. I forgot about those kinds.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.
4f3GfrN6aa	I work in retail.  I think they're great.<br>  <br>  When I'm accepting a $50 or a $100 note as payment, I can look at the window and check that the clear plastic is embossed with the denomination of the note.  I can also see pretty much instantly whether it is part of the note, or has been glued in as a forgery.  <br>  <br>  I don't care whether the Australian currency is volatile on the international cash market.  If my till is out because I accept a counterfeit, it comes out of my pay.  I'm only worried about how that affects my pay packet.  I'm glad we have the polymer banknotes because it's very hard to counterfeit and they are more durable than the paper notes.  And I've seen them go through industrial dryers at my other work, which would burn a conventional paper note.  The polymer ones just shrink down.  You can exchange them for another at the bank.<br>  <br>  I think they're better than paper notes.  Believe me, people counterfeit them, especially the fifties.  But because they are polymer notes, it's real easy to spot a counterfeit, so most people don't get away with it.<br>  <br>  If you're going to badmouth currencies, I've got four words for you.  New Zealand and Zimbabwe!  They are way worse than Australia.  And not so long ago, the Aussie Dollar was nearly at parity with the US Dollar.  Having a lower value currency is great because Australia exports most of it's GDP.  It means that the currency we get in return is worth more.  What's the problem with that?
lU8e0VQFaa	Most likely what happened was when you were late the card was canceled by the company which means even though you paid it off, it's no longer any good. Also, you were late, they are punishing you by increasing your interest, that is completely normal.

ZZR9OTzVaa	Considering we are in a major recession and will be for the forseeable future, I would concentrate on stocks that do well during recessions and major downturns. Industries like tobacco, health care, pharma, and soda companies tend to do well during bad times. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, I would take a look at companies that will not only grow during a recession but will also pay a hefty dividend (which can either put cash in your pocket or be used to buy more shares). <br>  <br>  Here is a list of my top 10 favorite dividend stocks that should do well during the recession. The combined return of the dividend and the stock appreciation should provide a much greater return than bonds.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stocksbuyorsell.com/stocks-buy-sell/353-dividend-stocks-will-perform-well-during-recession.html" rel="nofollow">http://stocksbuyorsell.com/stocks-buy-se...</a>|`|6IIErXlmaa	It was on Enrique iglesias face but then he got it removed|`|ztAePuMHaa	This site is growing fast and FREE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.me2everyone.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.me2everyone.com/</a>

GtBOQPKqaa	Did you report this to Verizon at the time? Most phone companies will block that number once you report it lost, missing or stolen.<br>  <br>  Did you also report it to the police?<br>  <br>  Why shouldn't you mind paying it? Have you considered taking your ex-roommate to small claims court? If you did not incur such a big bill, the person who did would be liable (responsible).<br>  <br>  The people with whom you spoke at Verizon all used a tactic common in collections strategy. HOWEVER, in spite of what they insist, their options are legally limited if you make "good faith" payments of at least five dollars ($5) per month. Then, if they take action against you, such as suing you, they'd look stupid if it were revealed you'd been making good faith payments all along.<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting you pay only five dollars a month; that is the current legal minimum. Your best bet is to pay as much as you can.<br>  <br>  You may wish to seek advice from an attorney in regards to suing your ex-roommate for the money owed. I would also suggest giving Verizon your ex-roommate's information if you have it.|`|9r2SBjA1aa	-yes send your money they have to accept it  and it will keep you out of collection

eACZ1Rhjaa	There are dozens of ways to do it. My husband and I bought a house VA with nothing down. We didn't flip it but it is worth much more now than 30 years ago.<br>  <br>  My friend moved into her boyfriend's home and used her money to buy materials to make improvements. They sold by owner and split the profits. She did use her money but she could have put it all on credit cards. She loved remodeling and he didn't but they made so much money they were going to buy another fixer upper and live in it while she remodeled then sell it at a profit.<br>  <br>  The problem with the programs are they count equity that doesn't exist to say they are rich. Just because you paid less than the asking price doesn't mean you have instant equity.

ByjDJMWCaa	One of the problems right now is that ALL the credit card companies are raising their APR's even if your credit is perfect.  You may have borrowed the money at a certain rate that you could have easily paid back but next month you may not be able to make all the payments.<br>  Is it moral to loan money at one rate and then after it was borrowed change the rate?  Is it moral to borrow money and not pay it back?<br>  I really don't thing it is a question of morality.  I think it is wrong for the credit card companies to raise the rates for NO reason.  I also think it is wrong to borrow money you KNOW you will not pay back.  Earlier I asked if I could buy a golf cart just before I declare bankrupcy and was told to use my feet.  Yes, I think some of the answers here are a little insensitive.  I do walk to work.  I do walk everywhere.  But have you ever tried to carry groceries up a VERY steep hill?  Where I live golf carts are the only form of transportation.  Oh and about my bankruptcy thing...I have never been even one day late with one payment...my credit is PERFECT but I had some emergencies and now I just can not continue to stay affloat.  I have already paid the credit card companies back way more than I ever borrowed  Once you add all the interest, I am sure they have made a lot of money from me.  But I am going to go in and declare bankrupcy and probably pay them half of what is left on the debt and start over before I totally go insane from worry about my bills.  I already paid them and the govt paid them. What more do they want?|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I agree with MSAD, I work hard at a job I hate to pay my bills. I was out of work for a time and got into a little bit of trouble with my credit card. I could have said screw it and wait for it to go off my report, but instead I got a small loan with an interest rate that was less than half my credit card and then shredded the card. Yeah, paying your bills sucks, but it's not the CEO's fault that many people see a credit card as free money and don't think ahead to how they're going to pay it back. You get in $10-$15,000 in credit card debt or buy a car or house you can't afford, who do you really have to blame but yourself?<br>  <br>  Yeah, the economy sucks, but if people had been smart with their money to begin with, they wouldn't have as big a problem as someone with a huge mortgage on a worthless house and maxed out cards with 35% interest on them.|`|dPLkNRNuaa	So.....knowingly....deliberately.... borrowing money at 30% interest and then refusing to pay it back is moral?<br>  <br>  What a lot of people on this site promote is personal responsibility.<br>  <br>  Many of the people on this site (myself included) are very responsible with our money. As such, when we borrow money....we get interest rates that are much better than 30%.   Remember...the interest rate you get charged is based on your credit history.  Good credit history = good interest rate.  Bad credit history = bad interest rate. <br>  <br>  Many people encourage people to get their financial houses in order.<br>  <br>  I frequently encourage people to listen to Dave Ramsey.  <br>  <br>  I don't condemn you.  But I'm not going to tell you that ignoring your responsibilities is ok either. <br>  <br>  If you want someone to pat you on the back and tell it's a good thing to ignore your responsibilities....go have a beer with your broke friends who are also ignoring their responsibilities. <br>  <br>  As far as bank CEO's go.....that has nothing to do with it. They get paid to do a job.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Regardless of the actions of the bank CEO's and whomever else you decide to lump in to this rant, of course it is a moral issue to pay back your debts. You always have the choice to not use their service and to terminate your contract with them and go to someone else. You agreed to use their service for a fee no matter what it is. You have a moral obligation to live up to your word. Now Shut up and be a man about it. If you don't, Then your morals are not as high as you think or you should really sit down and redefine yourself as a man and your morals.|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	It isn't moral not to pay your debts. Companies don't have morals people do. Sometimes it is stupid to pay debts but morals makes people do it anyhow.<br>  One lady was widowed after her husband ran up over 100K in medical bills for his cancer. She was low income working in a motel but keep working until every cent was paid. She said he would have rolled over in his grave if he thought the people who tried to save him weren't paid.<br>  She ended up retired with nothing having worked as long as she needed to get the debt paid but her morals demanded she pay the debt. Most would have filed bankruptcy because it took a lot of years to pay off the debt and she had nothing.|`|AA10491661	according to God and the bible, it's a moral issue. the bible says to pay your debts. I guess if your not a christian and don't believe in God, then do what you like.|`|WvAlIncZaa	Nobody is condemning anyone from what i've seen.  There are those, including myself, that live and average life and have average credit.  As of now, I don't owe anyone jack thank God but I can get myself into a hole where I will owe a creditor money and I will have to pay them back.  Does it make me a bad person that i'm struggling while doing so?  Of course not.  The ones that I have no pitty for though, are those that choose to take their cc and spend money that they know they don't have on junk.  Is it really necessary to buy that flat screen LCD with your credit card?  Do like most responsible people do that live within their means.  SAVE and spend your extras on those toys when yoyu feel like treating yourself.<br>  <br>  I also have no pitty for people that love the point out "outrageous" interest rates.  It wasn't so outrageous when you saw that credit limit and signed the bottom line knowing full well that with your income, you won't be able to repay debt, if it got there.  If someone owed you money, you would want them to repay you in a respectable time frame.  That's why we borrow within our means.  You don't see people going to loan sharks left and right do you?  No, they go to their parents, grandparents, etc if their in a spot.  Do the same with credit companies.  Don't go to the one that's willing to extend you a $5,000 credit limit but of course on the other end they are charging 30%+ interest.  Go to your local credit union, etc and apply for a smaller one, maybe $1,000 where they know you and they will negotiate a fair interest rate.
WQ3QFjb7aa	No matter where you are going for an interview, you are supposed to look professional.

Sigh!<br>  <br>  If you really are serious about working there, I suggest that you reapply or call and talk to the manager, hopefully they'll give you another opportunity to impress but this time rethink your wardrobe choices, it's always important to look and act professional, always make eye contact and try not to keep your answers too short. Personality goes a long way!!!!|`|3BcvcJX9aa	You are hot, and know it.  But in an interview, this might not be the best clothes to wear.  Try something a little more conservative the next time.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Perhaps he was not impressed by your other assets, or lack thereof, like experience.

Not trying to be mean- but you should ALWAYS go dressed on the conservative side (no midriff showing and no short shorts). <br>  <br>  Hollister is not Hooters. <br>  <br>  Also, if you said 'like' every other word, that does not make a good impression. <br>  <br>  Work on your interview attire and demeanor and you'll find a job soon! :)|`|YorMkZYAaa	Bleached-blonde, over-tanned, slutty looking skeaze.

The property is usually owned privately or through a corporation.

Insurance,<br>  garbage and water services go up periodically,include services such as landscaping, repairs, these things and sometimes more are bundled into the price of your rent, which makes the rent go up as much as 7% yearly just to cover expenses.  You are the benefactor of these things in your day to day living so think twice before knee jerk thinking you are being 'gouged'. Remember- you can always leave. Buy property to place your mobile home on.  You may find it's cheaper to stay where you are.

Also, going into the armed services and learning is good,and in many ways free,  but you are not always guaranteed those duties in the armed services, or for that matter, that you will do it when you leave the armed services.<br>  <br>  Because an accounting person and an anesthesiologist are two non related fields of endeavor, I could only see them cross when you take an administrative position where you may oversee a group of anesthesiologists but in an administrative business capacity. Such as chief surgeon, but most probably on a board of some sorts, which takes experience and years.<br>  <br>  You may have a change of mind in terms of length and to what degree you want to attach yourself to the field of your choice 6, 7, or so years from now. good luck.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Your plan is possible.

SN5dYkafaa	Ninasgramma got it right! The annual gift-tax exclusion for 2008 was $12,000 ($13,000 in 2009) per person/per unlimited number of recipients. A gift tax return would be filed reflecting the additional $88,000 "taxable" gift, and said gift would reduce her lifetime taxable gift exemption of $1 million.  <br>  <br>  So, if Grandma made lifetime gifts of less than $1 million, this would NOT be a taxable event to either party.<br>  <br>  PS - be sure to choose your "Best Answer" when the time comes.

TLcON6Inaa	Sometimes payments are listed as “rent” when in reality they are actually for the purchase of the property. A conditional sales contract generally exists when at least part of the payments are applied toward the purchase or entitle the taxpayer to acquire the property under advantageous terms. Payments made under a conditional sales contract are not deductible as rent expense but qualify for depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. Chapter 4 of Publication 535, Business Expenses, discusses the circumstances under which a conditional sales contract generally exists.<br>  <br>  Here is the link to pub 535 - <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Also here is publication 537 so you can report your installment sale properly. <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p537/ar02.html#en_US_publink10001149" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p537/ar0...</a>|`|d3hcJVphaa	2 points|`|02fbb4641d7549de08946f8490ae69bfaa	Yes.

And these costs are paid by the buyer to the closing company - payable to the closing company.  <br>  <br>  So the real estate agent shouldn't have any contact w/the buyer's money.<br>  <br>  If you feel something unethical or illegal has happened you should consult with your state real estate commission, or the local board of REALTORS, if the agent is a realtor.

If you are, then there is no set pay, and you are paid by the jobs that you take (every company pays different fees).

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Did they mention "job training" when you signed up to work with the company? It is not uncommon for companies to require workers to take some kind of training. Is the place that you work close to where you live? Is the training being held in another location? Is there a reason why the location is so far from where you live? You should talk to the agency and find out what their minimum requirements for the training are, like what days you have to be there, how long each day will take, etc. They probably are requiring training instead of years of experience, or to train you on their equipment. They should be paying you something for the training, or the training shouldn't be mandatory. Sometimes a company says "mandatory" when it's not really mandatory to get maximum participation from employees. Talk to the company, try to work out a compromise, if you can't, look for another job.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

That's the first step.  Apologize for baby's crying, and make your request of him. <br>  <br>  You should think about moving if this is a huge irritant, because it sounds like your LL may do little.  BUT if you don't talk to him about the problem, he can't do anything.  Put him on notice, by typing out a letter with your complaints (after reading lease).  Ask for specific remedy from LL within two weeks.  Keep a copy of your letter.  He may not even be aware that the upstairs tenant removed the carpeting--ask that it be replaced to lessen noise.  Also express concern about boxes upstairs as being unattractive for the building and also attractive to pests.|`|AA11215123	you are generally entitled to "quiet enjoyment" of your home<br>   <br>  if what you say is true then you can't be the only one of five neighbors who is grossly annoyed - consult with them all and notify the landlord in writing of your complaints (do it alone if you must) - it is against most leases to do things like tear up carpet, and make alterations<br>  <br>  much of the noise you must simply put up with as the cost of urban apartment living, but if it happens late into the evening it could rise to the point that the police can be called

There may always be times when an emergency comes up and I think that is why credit cards began.  But now it has turned into an ugly scheme of theft by the credit card companies.  They are all raising the APR's right as I write.  Even people with perfect credit who borrowed money thinking they would pay it back at a certain rate are having their APR's raised.  What other company in the world could loan you money at one rate and then arbitrarily change the agreement later.  Only the credit card companies.  It is in the fine print.  They can change the rate for any reason at any time or basically for NO reason at any time and that is what they are doing.  They are doing it now, just after they all received money from our government as a bailout.  And the executives of those companies are still going on cruises and getting paid golden parachute deals and who knows what else.

More people would be forced to live within their means, spending only what is in their bank accounts instead of over spending and accumulating massive amounts of debt. People would not buy so many frivalous things that they could not afford. However, some things, would change in the world. For example, it would take longer to get thru checkout lines at stores like was once the case, because people will be writing checks again. It would be difficult to shop online unless every one had a PayPal account and every online retailer accepted PayPal.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	You should read reviews about the complex that you are researching. Many times people (both current and past tenants) will write reviews about the complex online, and they will give you an idea of what to expect. <br>  <br>  Consider the proximity the apartment is to your work, school, and recreational areas (dining establishments and stores you visit), sometimes higher rent in close proximity to where you need to be, is worth it to avoid high gas prices, longer time spent in traffic, etc. <br>  <br>  If you have pets, look for a place that allows small pets. <br>  <br>  If you want a washer and dryer in your unit, look for an apartment complex that has them. If you don't care if it's in your unit, look for one that offers on site facilities, but remember that they will require quarters (our apartment is $1 to wash $1.25 to dry) and figure that into your monthly expenses. <br>  <br>  Consider the bills that you will be required to pay, some apartment complexes pay for trash pick up, water, heat, and other utilities, while others require you to pay for these things. Make sure to keep these expenses in mind when deciding what you can afford. <br>  <br>  Consider the maximum occupancy for the apartment. Some apartment complex's allow 2 people in a one bedroom and no more than 3 people in a 2 bedroom apartment. Since maximum occupancy varies by complex, make sure that you do not exceed the number of occupants that the complex allows in the unit you rent. <br>  <br>  Consider if you want furnished or unfurnished. Furnished can save you money on furniture, but if you own a lot of furniture already you might have to either sell it or pay to store it (which I do not recommend). <br>  <br>  Consider closet space, do you have a lot of clothes? Most apartment buildings only have one walk in closet in them, and not a lot of hall cabinets like linen cabinets. Consider the amount of closet space, cabinet space, and shelf space you will need to decide if it's right for you. <br>  <br>  Find an apartment in a neighborhood that you feel safe in. You don't want to be too close to a freeway because it will be really loud. Consider if you want an upstairs or downstairs unit. Stairs can be a pain in the neck to climb up and down all day, but living downstairs can mean a lot of outside noise along with a lot of noise that sounds like it is "coming thru the ceiling". <br>  <br>  Consider other things you might need, in terms of appliances, do you want a gas stove or an electric stove. Does the place have heating, air conditioning, and other things you might need. <br>  <br>  As far as carpet goes, stay away from places with white carpet and places with black carpet as they are the two easiest colors of carpet to destroy. <br>  <br>  Do you need a place with a pool, gym, tennis court, etc? Look at the complex ammenities, and consider the ammenities when you consider the price of the monthly rent, for instance a place with a pool and a gym could save you money on a gym membership or YMCA fees. <br>  <br>  Find a place that you love, and hope for good neighbors!|`|f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	1.

ByjDJMWCaa	Nothing a credit card company does is risk free or for free. Read the fine print.  They can change the terms at any time for any reason or for no reason.  All the credit card companies are raising the APR's right now.  All of them are doing it, even if your credit is perfect.  They are doing it because they can.  Nothing they do is free.  It is all well thought out to trap you into being in debt.  Charge nothing.  If you do charge something, pay it off as soon as you get the first bill.  Do not let them trap you into paying them back 40,000 dollars for a 10,000 dollar loan.<br>  That is what you will pay if you only pay the minimum and your APR goes up high enough.|`|24kFbAdsaa	"There ain't no free lunch."

If not, save up some money, a little bit from each paycheck that you receive, and go to Zales. You can purchase a decent ring there affordably. Also check their web site, as they offer great deals online. It's not the size of the ring, but the relationship that will matter in the end anyway.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Jewelry is a luxury item, so yes, good credit is usually needed. Not to be mean, but if she really loves you and wants to marry you she shouldn't care how big of a diamond you buy her and it shouldn't have to be from Tiffany's. You can get a decent ring from Kay's or even Wal-Mart for a couple hundred dollars. And then in a few years when you're more on your feet buy her something bigger.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	It is just not worth it. Take her out for dinner - and buy a decent ring when you have the cash.<br>  <br>  I would hate a ring to be given to me on credit.<br>  <br>  Bide your time, it is not all about material things but about how you treat her.

f6dxZXPGaa	is getting easier by the day to release your own music and build a music career without the backing of a label. That's an exciting thing for musicians, and for a lot of people, it's the best choice. On the other hand, there's a tendency for the DIY route to be romanticized. In reality, like any other kind release, the choice to self release your music comes with pros and cons (don't forget to check out major label deal pros and cons and indie label deal pros and cons). Before you decide to self release your album, don't forget to weigh up these factors.<br>  <br>  Self Releasing an Album: The Pros:<br>  <br>     1.<br>  <br>        You Keep Your Rights: Forget worrying about confusing contracts, expensive lawyers, and accidentally signing over your music, your vision and perhaps your first born child to some record label for life. You're not very well going to trap yourself in a bad deal, now are you? You decide how your music is used, when it is used, and how much people have to pay to use it, end of story.<br>     2.<br>  <br>        You Keep the Cash: Ever marvel at the way that some extremely successful musicians are seemingly flat broke? Sure, sometimes they're in that position because they bought things like, say, gold plated tanks (ahem, not mentioning any names), but often they're in the position because they're last on the list to be paid. Every person that comes in to help with your career gets a cut, but when you're doing it yourself, you get to eat the whole pie.<br>     3.<br>  <br>        You Make It (Or Don't) On Your Own Terms: Even the most laid back, artist friendly independent label is bound to have a few limitations in mind when it comes to projects they're willing to work on with you, and major labels can be extremely demanding. Some labels may want to send you back to the studio when you decide to change musical directions or they may demand you adopt a "look" for marketing purposes. There are lots of ways you can clash creatively with a label, and depending on what kind of deal you have, sometimes the label will win. When you're the one putting out the music, you release the music you want, and only the music you want, when you want to release it. The marketing, the touring - all of the decision will be made by you, so there will be none of the typical conflicts.<br>  <br>  Self Releasing an Album: The Cons:<br>  <br>     1.<br>  <br>        You've Got to Foot the Bill: One of the main reasons many people want a record deal is so there is some money behind their release. A major label deal may bring a nice advance and even a small indie label is going to pick up many of the costs associated with releasing a record, like PR and pressing. If you release it yourself, the financial burden will be yours alone, and that can be limiting when it comes to accomplishing everything you want to get done. It could also mean you will be facing a mountain of debt if you don't sell as much as you anticipate.<br>  <br>        Also, labels will have established relationships with manufacturers and PR companies that often translate into credit agreements and reduced rates, since the labels throw a lot of business their way. When you're establishing yourself, you may be asked to pay upfront for your orders, and you can expect to pay full price.<br>     2.<br>  <br>        You May Not Have the Contacts: Speaking of established relationships, labels will have a stack of contacts in place that help them promote their releases - media, promoters, agents and so on. If you're new to the music biz, you'll have to build your little black book from scratch. Of course, everyone has to start somewhere, and if you keep plugging away at self releasing your music, you'll have your own network of connections soon enough. Don't underestimated the time this can take, though - not having these contacts in place from the outset will make your job a little harder.<br>     3.<br>  <br>        You'll Be Learning While Doing: If you don't have much music industry experience to speak of it, you'll face a learning curve when you start putting your music out there. It will take some time to figure out what works - and what doesn't - for you. It can be an expensive lesson.<br>     4.<br>  <br>        It's a Full Time Job: Depending on your goals for your music, promoting a record can be EXTREMELY time consuming. Arranging press, keeping track of sales, promoting the album, booking shows - it really is a full time job. When you're doing all of this work, you're not concentrating on your music, so it's easy to find yourself in the position where you've made some good headway with the promotion of your first release but you don't have anything fresh to follow up with because you've been consumed with the business side of things.
2opG5Qaoaa	It depends on your job.|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Well since you have not added what your occupation is and how many hours you do in a day and whether you get overtime or not i dont think anyone has a chance in hell of telling you
3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	The post office cannot trace a letter that was sent regular mail unless it was sent with delivery confirmation which is very unlikely in the case that you described. The first thing that you should do is call the company that issued the check (not the bank, but the company the check was from) tell them that you never received it and ask them to cancel the check and issue you a new one. If the check has not been cashed, they will have no problem doing this for you. If the check has been cashed, you will first have to prove you did not cash the check, then file a police report, and then the company should issue you a new check. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope you get your money!|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	If it was sent regular mail then they cant trace it.|`|d3A83djHaa	They can't.  But they do need to fire your deliveryman.  Especially since this this wouldn't be the first time they gave someone the wrong mail.
6LPeWXYuaa	I agree w/Courtney.  <br>  <br>  Since you are married, your husband's VA eligibility and your income can be all that is required to get the VA loan you need for the house you want to buy.<br>  <br>  If loss of your husband's income lowers the approved loan amount, that is another issue, but it could still be a VA loan.<br>  <br>  At least, it should work out that way.  If you weren't legally married, it would probably be different.|`|LrXxwtj3aa	Did he qualify because he is a veteran?  If he is, you can still qualify for a VA loan.  The VA backs the loan, they do not actually give you any money.  The lender pre-qualified you for a certain amount of money, your husband's veteran status makes him eligible to be backed by the VA.  Does that make sense?  If you used your husband's income to get pre-approved then that amount will absolutley change.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homeloans.va.gov/eligibility.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.homeloans.va.gov/eligibility....</a><br>  <br>  These are the rules for eligibilty, see if you still qualify.<br>  <br>  I am trying to think of a better way to put this.  You are eligible for a VA loan based on certain criteria like being a veteran.  It has nothing to do with income.  So see the website or call the VA at 888-869-0194 to see if he still qualifies.  Your bank will set the amount of money that you can borrow, not the VA.  I hope that is clearer. =)|`|2a4Wkunmaa	yeah
xBd96wvRaa	Microsoft is because they outsource so much of their workforce.<br>  <br>  That is not as simple of a question as it appears to be.  <br>  <br>  Technology does eliminate jobs. That is why companies invest in new technologies and business automation. Both factory jobs and office workers are effected. <br>  For example what took a team of accountants to keep track of can now be done by one with the help of a good computer program. <br>  <br>  Technology creates higher end jobs then the result of their work replaces. <br>  <br>  Technology allows companies to grow faster through efficiently and global business solutions. CEO's are more equipped via collected data and easy reporting tools to make good business decisions. <br>  <br>  When businesses grow they hire more people.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	Yes, like factory jobs mostly. Now they have machines that produce faster, more accurate, and cheaper, so there is little need for workers.|`|ZNjmoGS8aa	I think that technology may be at fault for some jobs being eliminated.  It sure does make jobs easier.  So, when it comes to easier jobs, less people are needed to perform certain tasks.  <br>  <br>  I know that some companies are finding other positions for these people, so their job is not lost.  Others have no choice but to eliminate those people.  Especially in today's economy.|`|lvDam67Saa	factory<br>  <br>  grocery types<br>  <br>  schooling....<br>  <br>  things like those try and figure out how|`|QXcbS8C1aa	duh almost everything these days..|`|JzVIDI4raa	yes. yes. yes.|`|uj63QUGoaa	only factory workers so i think

The lender that made the bad loan may have to eat the loss.<br>  <br>  But I would recommend you stay informed about your credit report.  If you are one of the "lucky" ones, make sure your credit report is amended.
AA11349244	I have not experienced them but I have seen their website. My background is as a Legal Debt Recovery Specialist, i do see that seem ok but when it comes to contractual agreements you need to have some type of legal adviser who specializes in this area, I would be very skeptical in using them because they do not mention anything about using attorney's to renegotiate contracts (if they do they are hiding this fact for an odd reason.) <br>  Your best bet is going with a company, that out rightly states having a legal counsel team especially one that know and understands about legal documentation and contractual agreements (especially that are filed by a recorder office). Did you know that up 80% of the those loan docs filed have some type of discrepancy and which could wind up having some "debate" in your favor causing possible legal recourse with the lender,  this process involves loan forensics and I recommend this process. Your best bet is going though The Loss Mitigation Team in California or email: rregal117@mail.com They specialize by knowing everything about real estate and law. Save your Home doesn't offer this.|`|CzomHedfaa	I am also looking into this company.

Qqz0H2hEaa	Always get an agent to represent you.  They can help you figure out if the house is a good buy.<br>  Always get the house inspected before you buy it.<br>  Always get title insurance so you know you own it free and clear with no "clouds" or liens on the title.<br>  always get homeowners hazard insurance.<br>  In this case have a professional roofer come over and give you an estimate before you buy.<br>  The seller does not care if you borrow or pay in cash-they get cash either way. <br>  <br>  Your parents will need to write a contract to tie up the house and get the contract accepted- then they can get the inspection done and be sure they really want it after they know all about it.<br>  <br>  The title work will take two weeks in Texas but could take two months in some other states.<br>  <br>   Your parents save whatever the cost would be to create the loan and save all interest cost.  They lose the use of the money since it is tied up in the house, but I would buy it for cash if I could and not have the worry of a house payment.|`|DhynnoO5aa	Debt free is the way to be!!  Pay cash, get title insurance regardless to make sure there are no hidden issues such as unpaid taxes or mechanic liens....<br>  <br>  Get a good inspector to look t it.  <br>  <br>  A good inspection should not cost more than $2-.300.00; make sure they are reputable.  Have the seller provide a home warranty for peace of mind.|`|AA11215123	These are great questions to ask your Buyers Agent, who is most familiar with your details.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	If its only 60K then a little roof repair is nothing. You will of course go through a lawyer and they will help with things like insuring the title is clear etc, then it will be their but on the line if it turns out you are buying from a tenant instead of the owner etc.

kGJND4lYaa	Assuming you are filing as a non-resident alien:<br>  <br>  First off, you seem confused. Stocks do not have earned income, they produce dividend and capital gain income. If your country does not have a tax treaty with the US which assigns a different tax rate to this income, the tax rate is 30%.<br>  <br>  However, qualified dividends and capital gains (defined on p.20 of Publ. 550) are taxed at 15%.

Under your county you should find the Housing Authority, those are the people you call.    You can apply in up to 2 counties, the one you live in now and the one you work in now.

But before you make that trip look up their phone number to inquire to see if they are taking application because I know in my city the section 8 housing list is closed because they are just getting around to serving the people who signed up back in 2003.  But you could still apply for scattered sites that is for low income housing such as apartments or even houses that maybe available in your area.
