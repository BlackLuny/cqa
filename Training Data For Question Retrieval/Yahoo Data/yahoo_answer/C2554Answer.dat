It is usually limited to 2500 and the car has to be kept in a locked garage and you have to have another personal auto policy for your other vehicle.<br>  <br>  I've found some good information here too...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://insurance.deal4-you.com" rel="nofollow">http://insurance.deal4-you.com</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	I've had 'Grundy'  Ins. on my '69 Camaro for a few year's now. I've owned the car for 22 year's.<br>  I pay $250.00 a YEAR for a guaranteed/agreed value of $15,000. That also cover's state liability requirements.<br>  For that price, I don't know why everyone doesn't have a classic car!<br>  You don't need an appraisal until after $35,000 I think. God forbid it get's stolen, there's no arguing over it's value because it's $15,000 period which is awesome.<br>  With State Farm, it was $500 a year and you have to PROVE it's value if something happens and other regular company's won't even touch classic car's.<br>  <br>  Anyway, with Grundy, you'll need to send them some pictures with your application. Then they review it from there and accept you or not. As usual, driving records and such are considered too.<br>   <br>  You must be atleast 25 year's old.<br>  You must have another car that you use to drive daily.<br>  You can't use your Chevelle for racing.<br>  You can't use it for daily driving like going to work etc.<br>  You must have a covered garage.<br>  <br>  They've never made me jump through any hoops or anything. Just fill out the app. and send the pics and check. I'm honest and fall into all there category's so I'm confident about it. <br>  I do drag race at the track a few times a year but that's my risk and wouldn't expect them to cover me there at all since I'm not suppose to be. There are company's that insure drag car's believe it or not, but i've never looked into that. I'm more worried about being rear ended or having it stolen.<br>   <br>  I would like to try 'Hagerty' as they were $50 cheaper. Some of my friends have them. The reason I'm with Grundy is that I live in a 4 family apartment building with a garage in the basement and Grundy was ok with that but Hagerty wasn't because my 3 neighbors have access to the garage.<br>  <br>  Also, the car has to be atleast 75% complete.

VyxvT0fuaa	first question first, a capacitor is a quick discharging battery suited for car audio systems to supplement the sometimes weak charging/battery systems that come factory, usually used when the car audio system draws too hard on the cars battery/alternator, most easily spotted by dimming lights in and on the car.<br>  <br>  yes this is a capacitor, I haven't installed this particular model, but I have installed many very similar. For the price point it seems like a pretty good deal, just keep in mind that the typical life of a capacitor like this is about 2 years.<br>  <br>  and the volt meter is mostly just for show.|`|oGqMC4Eyaa	Yes this is a capacitor.  A capicitor is placed inbetween the power source so your car battery and the amp.  It acts as a protector kindof.  When your subs hit low bass anddraw lots of current from your battery there is a significant voltage drop.  The capictor is similar to a battery it senses the drop and provides your amp with the extra power it needs to feed the subs.  this protects your battery, saves your alternator, and prevents headlight dimming etc.  its basically like having a second battery.  Also the higher the farad rating the more power it supplies.  1.0 farad per 1000 RMS is recomended however I runa 2.5 for 1000 RMS and I still feel i need more at times when there are really powerful bass notes being played.|`|AA10721138	bretlasater, I have a question for you.<br>  Source(s):<br>  car audio installer fist class, car audio shop owner since 2003<br>  <br>  If that is true then how the hell do you not know this, a cap is only going to stifffen the voltage to the audio system, and yet put another strain on your electrical system. thus not helping with lights dimming at all. Since your a first class installer and sudio shop owner, you shoukd know this. I really do not believe you at all. I would not let you even think about touching my Infiniti G35. <br>  To stop your lights from dimming look into the big 3 upgrade and a better battery, a deep cycle battery. Optima yellow tops were made for high power audio systems. After I think, can not remember off the top of my head, around 2000 - 2500 watts rms you will need an HO alternator.

b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Take it to a mechanic and have a check done on it. Your family wouldn't give you an unsafe car to drive, hopefully.

Considering all gas stations buy their fuel from the same fuel depot, I'm not convinced there is a difference from one brand to the next.|`|DBvjwPTcaa	Premium petrol with a higher octane number basically combust better, less knocks. Inproper combustion can cause carbon build up causing additional ignition along with your spark plug. The colliding explosion of air fuel mixture ignition causes a knock. However this is not common today.<br>  The fancy names of petrol may come from different companies like Shell, Esso etc. <br>  Oil companies are commonly known to buy petrol from each other to suppliment their stock. It is therefore difficult to say who is the better one.<br>  <br>  Some add a little detergent to aid in cleaning the piston. Where aromatic hydrocarbon like benzene present, it is substitute with MTBE (methyl tertiary buthyl ethane) and oxygenates which increase the oxygen content to improve combustion while reducing the known carcinogen, benzene. This is also used to substitute anti-knock compound Tetra ethyl lead or the previously known leaded gasoline.<br>  Its for the purpose of health and environment protection too.<br>  <br>  Anything too good (high octane number) may be a waste too.

QcENsfCEaa	Most dealer now do not care if its cash or finance if you have good credit. Interest is tacked on as you go in most car loans. the best deal is to get a loan from your credit unions dealers for the most part don't finance a car without making some money on the back end the F&I man adds some points to the rate to get more money on the deal.|`|JqVK95MWaa	first of all the credit history of you or f.i.c.o.will dictate how worthy of credit are u.second if your credit is good say above 750 point to 800 u probably could get a zero interest loan,but most of this loans are gear towards say 2009 vehicles.so the bottom line they have to run a credit report so they can see what your history is.if u have no credit then your parents could co-signing with u.that would be like giving  u all the credit they work so hard for.which is to me priceless.alot of people dont like co-signing due to it will affect there credit score due to too much debt and the possibility of the borrower defaulting not making the payments on time.and finally the interest is added to the price of the car u are buying if u paid 10k with an interest rate of 7 or 8 percent per thousand dollars borrowed equals about 17000 total divided by 6 years time to pay off the debt equals 2833 a year divided by 12 months equals 236 monthly payment not including automobile insurance.good luck|`|NlYGbqnkaa	The interest is calculated every month on the balance of the loan. So if you borrow lets say $10000 and make a payment of $1000 the next month the interest would be calculated on $9000 plus 30 days of interest. For you best bargaining approach don't discuss the financing at all until you have agreed upon the price of the car. The best way to negotiate that is run comparisons of similar cars at other dealerships or private parties that are cheaper. Also run the car on Kelly Blue Book and NADA.com. Offer somewhere around trade in Value. Once you've agreed to the price then see what rate the dealer can get for you. Compare that to what you can get from your local banks and Credit Unions. If the dealer gets a better rate go with there financing. If you don't need financing at all you won't be disclosing that til after the car price is agreed upon.|`|n4kJzXvVaa	Interest is not calculated monthly on a car loan, it is calculated daily on an automobile loan.  That is why when you get a payoff there is a per diem charge after each day.

And given how much more you're asking for, than the car is worth....it's incredibly unlikely anyone will buy it for that.

K6YSZES9aa	direct answer.<br>  <br>  you. dont. need. another. amplifier.<br>  <br>  why?<br>  <br>  coaxials needs/consumes only minimal watts and power and amplifiers can run  up to 8pcs of 6x9 without having any problems.<br>  <br>  if you run another amp, you will not hear any difference and will add up more power consumption and weaker power to other amps. unless you will add a good alternator and another set of battery.<br>  <br>  <br>  ok? <br>  <br>  just tap those speaker together with the other coax.|`|Y48qhj0Taa	Suggestion:<br>  <br>  Install a crossover in between the amp output (the amp for the highs) one for each channel; you can place them in the doors or where ever you would like. You also never said what kind of vehicle you have, doesn't really make a difference I guess. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the crossovers can split the frequencies to the highs and 6x9's, and the same for the rear. This may also help your imaging also. If you lower speakers are putting out highs it may sound like the sound is coming from you feet or floorboards and just say the tweeters are in the dash or up high. If you just send the highs to the tweeters then it will sound like the music is higher like at head level instead of at your feet.<br>  <br>  It will kill two birds with one stone if you want. Also make sure that the impedance is correct for the amp you are using.  Most four channel amps like to run at 4 ohms of resistance per channel. If you buy a crossover from the speaker shop or dealer make sure to have them explain the setup further. Be exact on the type, model, and size of speaker; they SHOULD be able to set you up and on you way.<br>  <br>  Most speaker shops can help you with the install, depending on the current wiring it, it could take a short period of time and cost a lot less then a new amp. And the sound difference will be a lot different depending on speaker location.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps some.|`|G0qkBsBkaa	Your tweeters don't need to be hooked directly to an amp. Your 6.5 or 6 by a should have 4 terminals one set for input and the other for output. And your tweeters should have  a high pass filter.    And for your battery and alternator you should get a capacitor they store charges for your amp.|`|LkXMoe2Xaa	a 4 Channel amp, to run the other speakers, and a Distribution block to run power to both amps. and that's all you need. I would suggest a batcap if your gonna run that much. You can find them online by searching "batcap"

I got 2 800w pyramid's for $20. oh and go with a 2 ohm set to give you better bass response.|`|5JI64hBnaa	STOP!<br>  <br>  Stock speakers, believe it or not, usually have better bass than aftermarket speakers because they are designed to play a full range of frequencies. Aftermarket speakers focus on midrange and treble. They can give you tighter midbass, but not better bass. I've had a lot of disappointed people who replace just their speakers and can't figure out why the stock junk sounded better. If you want bass, get a small sub like a powered bazooka tube or an Infinity basslink (though the infinity seems to be prone to problems). Or better yet, get a subwoofer AND replace your 6x9s. You WILL NOT get better bass from new gear.

daw140ceaa	If no one else can get to your vehicle's interior, then the only likely spot for a GPS tracking device is underneath the car.  There are magnetic GPS tracking systems available that are designed to work this way.<br>  <br>  Any GPS tracking system needs to have a power source.  The units designed to stick to the bottom of the vehicle work from a rechargeable battery.  Typically the device would only work for 5-7 days before it would have to be removed and recharged.  If someone is using such a device to track you on a long-term basis, then it would need to be located where he can easily remove and replace it when it needs to be charged.  Your car would also need to be accessible to him on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  You can take the vehicle to a mechanic and ask him to put it on a lift and inspect the undercarriage.

Sound like a muscle car because the exhaust fumes are just passing through the CAT section too quickly, so the silencers aren't as effective.<br>  No Power = If the CAT is blocking the exit pipe, the engine can't expel the gases and the O2 sensor will tell the ECU to not inject anymore fuel in to the engine.<br>  Car cutting out - while the CAT is shaking about in the housing, it can end up blocking the exit pipe which will then cause you engine to choke and cut out.  This also explains why you can start it up again after wards as fumes will have exited the engine.  <br>  <br>  Get under the car and give cat section a semi hand hit with your hand, if you here something rattling around, you no your cats gone.<br>  <br>  As CATS are Mega expensive, try this cowboy repair, put a 3 inch screw through both sides of the metal casing of the CAT.  This will hold the CAT in a position and stop it form blocking up any exits.<br>  Unfortunately, this is only a temporary fix and WILL fail again.|`|btM3ZcAqaa	no power when you put your foot down?  do the rpm's kinda fluctuate, jumping around at idle?  can't hold rpm's when you rev it in neutral?  if so, its a problem with induction...the engine is either getting too much, or not enough air.  it shouldnt be a big fix, maybe a rip somewhere along the intake line.  pop the hood, check it out...just dont hurt yourself.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	How many miles are on it since you have had the Catalytic convertor changed.

Find someone that has a hypertech type programmer for your PCM and experiment with the settings. Make sure your O2 sensors and exhaust system are in good condition. Stay off the gas pedal, Andretti.

AA10482788	What is a "normal" car? Is it something from the 80's? Is it an import? basically it all varies according to the car.Honda's seem to be one of the most expensive exhaust systems,also some Ford trucks have very expensive converters upward of 700.00's even in the aftermarket. If I had to give an average price for a complete system I would have to guess appx $250.00-$400.00,again depending on the car.|`|904d8796c3e4ff86e9122bd1dd6be562aa	It depends on what kind of car and what it needs.

Hope that helps.|`|fac67a37f8db05650acc85a39ff5915caa	what is wrong exactly? was it ripped off, if so just get it welded back on, if its a hole in the pipe? if so just get that section replaced. if its a muffler, about $60-80, if its a catalitic converter, it ranges depending on if it has an oxygen sensor or not($50-200) i would say $200 at the most if you go into a shop with some common sense,no offense, if you look at it as a system, you get ripped off, realize there are differant parts to your exaust.a section of pipe cost about $5 and labor is about $70 an hour. it usually takes 1 Hr for 1-2 sections of pipe or 1 muffler/converter.a borla catback exaust ranges from $400-1000, im sure theyll TRY to sell you whatever they thing they can, beware

Otherwise, there are no Japanese SEDANS (there are a few bad coupes) which do not meet your criteria and which are not good cars.  <br>  <br>  Also consider the Ford Escort/Mercury Tracer.  It is a MUCH better car than the Cavalier, and as good as many imports.  <br>  <br>  You might find a relatively recent Hyundai Elantra in your price range.  Pretty good cars.  I really like the hatch.<br>  <br>  The Celica is a coupe, by the way.  A good one, but still, not 4 doors.  <br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd lean heavily towards Toyota and especially Honda.  (My current car is a 92 Accord, and it's the best FWD Sedan I've driven...better than more recent Japanese cars.  I'd still take almost any RWD I've driven over it, and the Integra I'd test driven, but damnation it is so much better than Toyota or Mitsubishi, or even Mazda.

KtlurIK8aa	Many years ago I use to drive limo and I had read biographies on good drivers (both racing and street) and one of the most often mentioned components of good driving was - smoothness. It sound simplistic but if you are a smooth driver then all the rest of it, good gas mileage, less wear-and-tear, etc. just happen. Now I find myself driving this way almost all the time. Smooth starts, smooth lane changes, easy turns, smooth braking, letting off the gas and coasting when I can - all contribute to good mileage and a well maintained problem-free car.<br>  <br>  The second component is maintanance. Take care of your car as instructed in the owners manual. Keep it clean and waxed. Check your tires and fluids. Fix it before it breaks. Replace your wiper blades. There are books that instruct you on auto maintanace. Pick one up and read it.|`|AA10192221	Maintenance, Maintenance, Maintence.  It is far too easy to neglect your vehicle because everyone that doesn't know better just forgets about it when they step out and walk away.  Every car was made with a specific purpose in mind.  It was designed to be maintained the way the book tells you and no less.  If you dont change your oil on time you further subtract from the life of the vehicle.  If your coolant is too low you may overheat it.  Belts can lose grip or worst case, snap off, leaving you without much needed components like the alternator and water pump.  If most of the miles on it are city miles chances are your engine is building up nasty carbon deposits.  Old worn out spark plugs GREATLY reduce power, fuel efficiency, and set into motion other problems.  These can all be taken care of before they happen with the proper maintenance.<br>  <br>  As far as the way you drive.  That can sometimes give you problems as well.  When you slam on your brakes you'll probably warp them giving you a sort of pulsing that will keep you from stopping as good as you could have.  Turning fast will wear out your tires prematurely.  Riding a clutch will significantly reduce the lifespan of it as will grinding gears.  Low profile tires may (I'm not saying it will) wear out suspension components sooner.  As well as give you a horrible ride.  So in short don't neglect your vehicle or you'll get problems like the aforementioned.|`|hIon9iEYaa	They know how to upgrade from factory equipment<br>  <br>   They know how to do maintenance of their vehicle<br>  <br>  They think of their vehicle as a human - it gets treated like 1 too|`|ZvPTeFt7aa	Tune stock parts, clean the engine, etc.<br>  <br>  Or, if you'd rather, you can go out and buy aftermarket parts.  Some of these will boost gas mileage, give you more power, etc.  But if you prefer to stay stock, it's best to just clean up your engine, transmission and whatnot.<br>  <br>  Oh, it also depends on how you drive the car.  People who jam gears, and slam on the brakes, and everything...tend to have cars with a lot more problems, and a lot shorter lives...

German cars are very agile cars, I drive a VW passat. its the quietest, smoothest car I've ever driven, but its also a turbocharged 1.8 litre engine, so its got power too. Unfortunetly its also very expensive to repair. Japanese cars such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Infinity, Acura, Lexus, Subaru. Those are all excellent cars. They are all relaible and cheap to fix, so that makes them good used cars. if you buy used, you can get a car you wouldn't be able to afford, simply because its a year or two old. I would go used if I were you, you get a lot of car for not a lot of money. Good Luck

KtlurIK8aa	I drove a similar car (a Saturn) and the items you reference are all normal for a car with your mileage. As long as you perform the needed maintenance you should continue to have a good car. Regular fluid changes (oil, trans, antifreeze) and regular service when needed (brakes, muffler replacement, alignments, tires, belts hoses) will keep it running for a long time to come.

AN1EpGMqaa	I've been experimenting with powering different appliances with an inverter and solar power.As I have discovered,the AC motors will pull huge startup current,sometimes at least 5 times their running current.A motor that draws 1000 watts needs probably 5000 watts of surge current to start.To counter this,some inverter manufacturers are building soft start features in to their design,which greatly reduces the sudden load on the components.To achieve reliability powering a loaded 3/4 hp motor,I would need around 5000 watts of inverter.|`|KtlurIK8aa	Not real good on this but I suspect the motor when starting and stopping is pulling a huge load and causing the inverter to fail. I know motors when starting pull much more amperage then when just running.
qSBh48pmaa	It's good to learn the usual stopping and going and good hand placements stuff and general things to pass the test. Sticks do get easier after time but it take a lot of practice. Learn an automatic first.

KtlurIK8aa	Finding the fuel filter can be half the battle. The filter may be located anywhere between the fuel tank and injector fuel supply rail or throttle body. On many cars, trucks and vans the filter is often located underneath the vehicle along a frame rail or in a bracket near the fuel tank. On some vehicles the fuel filter is part of the electric fuel pump module located inside the fuel tank.<br>  <br>     Most fuel filters have an arrow indicating the direction of fuel flow. The fuel filter must be installed with the arrow pointing toward the engine and away from the fuel tank.<br>  <br>  First things first, if you value your life, do not smoke or allow any one near you to smoke while replacing the fuel filter. <br>  Replace the fuel filter on a cold engine to avoid the possibility of the fuel hitting an exhaust manifold or pipe and igniting. It only takes a small spark to ignite the fuel and cause a disaster.<br>  <br>     Most fuel filters have a cover or shield protecting them. They usually come off with a screwdriver or small wrench. Once the cover is off, you will see the fuel filter and lines. <br>  <br>  CAUTION: Fuel injected engines have fuel under high pressure in the fuel lines. Even if the vehicle has been sitting without being started for a day or two, there will still be pressure in the fuel system. Follow the manufacturer's procedure for relieving fuel pressure before you remove the fuel filter. Usually removing the fuel pump fuse or fuel pump relay and cranking the engine will relieve most of the fuel pressure.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is important, some fuel fittings will need a special tool to disconnect the lines from the fuel filter. Others will have a simple hex line fitting. Some Fords require a special tool to remove the fuel lines! Another type of fuel line fitting is the "push connect" fitting whcih is what you should have as these are found most often on Ford vehicles. <br>  <br>     With a small screwdriver, remove the hairpin clips from the line. Then just wiggle the fuel filter out of the fitting being careful not to kink the fuel line. Now put the two new hairpin clips that came with the new fuel filter and install them into the fitting. Use a golf tee or something similar to plug the fuel line and prevent fuel from running out of the fuel tank.<br>  <br>  Compare the new fuel filter with the old fuel filter, and make sure you position it in the same way so that the fuel is flowing in the right direction. Most times there will be an arrow on the fuel filter showing you which direction the fuel flows. Put the assembly together in reverse of the way you took it apart. Before you do, though, take a quick look at the new fuel filter. Again, a little oil or white grease on the fitting will help the hoses slide on easier.<br>  <br>     You'll see there are two tubes coming off the fuel filter where the hoses attach. They have little nubs or ridges near the ends. Make sure to slide the rubber lines onto the fuel filter as far past the nubs as you can get them, ideally up against the fuel filter body. Position the hose clamps between the nub and the fuel filter body. <br>  <br>  Make sure they good and tight, but not so tight as to strip the screw.<br>  <br>     The clamps used on the fuel lines are special clamps designed to seal the hose to the fuel filter fittings. They do not cut into the fuel hose and can withstand the higher fuel pressure. Ideally they should be replaced with the new fuel filter. Do not use the worm type "mini-clamps". They will damage the hoses and a fuel leak will develop.<br>  <br>  Okay, after you have everything reassembled and secure, crank the engine a few times with the ignition system disabled, if you can, until fuel pressure builds up. Then look over the fuel filter and fuel lines no make sure there are no big leaks. If everything is okay, start the engine and let it run for a few minutes, again checking for leaks.|`|ekOg4lTwaa	The fuel filter is under the car near the tank just to the rear of the drive axle.  It is probably held on with screw type hose clamps (due to the year, they weren't original equipment).  Make sure the key is off!  It has an electric fuel pump.  The filter is a pain, but it is easy enough to change.  Look at the rubber fuel hose, it may require replacement as well.
POkAWCd8aa	You can get a permit at 16 for a minimum of 6 months of supervised driving.  After that you get a provisional license which is 1 year of unsupervised, restricted driving (No driving between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., etc.).

1nyHEzXQaa	To properly sew it, you will need to remove the seat cover form the seat and cushion.  This usually involves small clips and/or screws, and then turning the seat cover inside out.  Then, using the smallest needle you can, sew the cover back together with a weather and heat resistant thread.  I recommend 8 pound fishing line.  Make sure that you sew at least 2 inches beyound the rip, as the thread will be weak beyond the problem.  Use the original holes if you can, you will be working for a while to make new holes.  then put the cover back on the cushions, takes a bit of work to get everything flat again, and reconnect the screws and clips, and you are good to go.|`|KtlurIK8aa	Sewing leather is harder than it looks.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	All of the answers above are 100% incorrect and quite possibly dangerous. Unfortunately, to answer your question with anything more than a wildly inaccurate guess requires a lot more information than what you have provided.<br>  <br>  We need: Year/make/model of vehicle to start. Then we need to know the original tire size that came on the car and the vehicle manufacturers recommended pressure for that size on that car.<br>  <br>  We also need to know a lot more about the size tire you actually have on the car now.  235/35/19 is incomplete.  We need the full description and here is why.  In these dimensions the tire description could be:<br>  <br>  235/35R19 86<br>  235/35R19 87<br>  235/35R19XL 91<br>  235/35R19RF 91<br>  <br>  Those last two digits in each size is the "service description" and tells us what the load carrying capacity of the tire is at a specific pressure.  Each one of those might have a different load capacity at a given pressure (say 35 psi for example) and it is that load capacity that tells us how much air pressure you need to run.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  <br>  The information printed on the sidewall of the tire only indicates the maximum inflation pressure of that tire.  It is not a recommended pressure for any particular vehicle so do not use it as such.  For example, a tire in this size with an 86 or 87 service description may have a max inflation pressure of either 41 or 44 psi depending on brand and model.  With a 91 service description max pressure is 51 psi.  It can be dangerous to run too little or too much air pressure.  Most of the answers above probably have you doing one or the other.  If you can add the additional information to your question I will give you a precise and detailed answer including the why.|`|AA12261615	you need to go by what the tire has printed on it,its written in tiny letters but i guarantee you its is there on the tire,always go by what the tire says it should be inflated at,you cant go by what the owners manual always says,it was written for the stock tires,and unless you still have the same ones on it,you,ll have to use the information given by the tire manufacturer on this one good luck hope this helps.|`|5RJnYguMaa	30. this is the national recomendation for car tyres.|`|GTBh6MFMaa	It will say on the tire.

KtlurIK8aa	You are smelling mold in the AC housing. It is caused by a buildup  of moisture. Frigi-Fresh is sprayed into the fresh air intake (behind the wiper, in front of the windshield) to help kill the bacteria and mold spores in the evaporator housing. It does help but won't last forever. Start the car, put the blower motor on low to medium speed. Follow the directions on the can and spray all of it into the system. Shut off the blower motor while spraying so the spray sits in the system and let it sit overnight.|`|69942f826bae7b10980cfdbf7bda2100aa	And once this is completed, the mold will return unless you take steps to keep the evaporator dry. After using the a/c, when you park, turn the a/c to vent and fan on high for about a minute. This turns off the a/c clutch and lets the blower dry the evaporator core, because moisture is what causes the mold growth.

Cytf5LWdaa	Probably can find one, but its an 07, pretty sure doing that will void your warranty.|`|KtlurIK8aa	For about $300 you can buy a replacement chip for your car's ECU (electronic control unit) that will retune your engine for aggressive performance. Performance chips are available for Volvo, BMW, Honda, Ford and other makes from companies like Dinan, Superchips, Upsolute, Autothority, Steve Conforti as well as from carmakers like BMW. Installing a chip costs another $75 or so. It's today's equivalent of spending hours tweaking the timing, carburator and sparkplug gap to coax a few more horses from a standard-issue powerplant. <br>  <br>  So you wonder why didn't the manufacturer program the chip for peak performance in the first place? Production engines must satisfy a whole slew of criteria, of which torque and horsepower aren't the most critical. By the time engineers get done meeting standards imposed by the EPA, FTC, insurance carriers and consumer advocates for mileage, emissions, safety, reliability and durability, the engine's power curve has been flattened. By contrast, performance chips tune the engine to optimize torque along the entire curve with no concern for consequences. For example, Conforti chips are touted as providing optimal power along the entire torque curve by remapping performance every 200 rpm. The payoff is more power on the low end and a smoother torque curve as the engine moves past 3500 rpms. The torque and horsepower boost provided by a performance chip is typically in the 5-10% range. That may sound modest, but the added pickup is enough to make the enthusiast feel like he's strapped into a rocket. <br>  <br>  The negatives? A noticeable reduction in gas mileage (typically 4-10%), more tailpipe emissions and a somewhat increased possibility of failure from exceeding the possibly sub-par tolerances attained by some component maker. Obviously popping in a performance chip carries the risk of bad or defective programming that can jeopardize engine life or void the manufacturer's warranty. Fortunately, the adjustments made by most chips are said to be transparent to the diagnostic computers used for routine maintenance

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	Several things, first you can check your radiator for leaks as the first post stated, that is in the front of the car. But if your leak is further back from there then you could have a leak in the heater core (the unit that provides heat inside the car when it's cold out), you could also have leaks from several other areas including any of the cooling system hoses, thermostat housing gasket, water pump, etc... you might want to have someone that know what and where to look to check it for you.<br>  <br>  As for the differences in coolant fluctuation between radiator and overflow container, there should be a hose that connects the two together, it may be missing, old and has cracks, or simply disconnected. Check for that.

23A8A04Caa	Before you do anything I would check your owner's manual for which refrigerant to use.  Freon was phased out in the mid-90s so I doubt your car uses it.  You probably need R-134a but check to make sure.  You don't want to mix refrigerants because your system was only designed for one type.  And yes, they are different.|`|dJDBCbeoaa	before you do anything check the owners book on it then you will need to take the car to someone you can do it for you a ase tech that works on auto ac can only do it do to the new epa law that tells you .also the system has to check for leaks and the proper freon can be installed|`|KtlurIK8aa	Air conditioning is a rather simple process based on some really simple principles of physics. Here I will describe those principles to you and give you an understanding of the magic so that you can do battle with those who wish to claim that you need to understand vudu in order to service an air conditioning system.<br>  <br>  To begin with try a simple experiment. Wet your finger and blow on it. Feel cool? That is the basic principle of air conditioning. Evaporation. There is no magic here. Just physics. <br>  <br>  Now, an imaginary experiment is in order. We will take a tank of liquid Freon. You used to be able to buy it at a reasonable cost but the powers that be have decided that it is bad stuff that is destroying the ozone layer and causing catastrophic things to happen down here on the earth. Very controversial subject - I am not going to get into that here. Let's suffice it to say that there are still two diametrically opposed views as to the damage that Freon is doing. It will all sort out in the end. <br>  <br>  So we have this can of Freon that is in the liquid state. It has been sitting on the table in front of you so it is at room temperature. As I mentioned before it has a very low boiling pressure so we have to have the can sealed with a valve on top. Now if we open the valve on the can the liquid Freon will start to boil (evaporate) as the pressure inside the can drops and reaches atmospheric. The Freon evaporates (boils) and it begins to get cool, like your finger did when the water evaporated. Only difference is that this stuff boils rapidly (evaporates) at atmospheric pressure so it gets VERY cold. If you were to take a fan and blow it across the outside of the can it would cool the air and blow it on your face and you would be cool, not that you aren't a cool person already else you wouldn't be reading this stuff in the first place. Notice that it isn't necessary to blow the Freon in your face, just the cold air surrounding the can. In fact if you blew the cold Freon in your face you would probably pass out for lack of oxygen, so let's put a funnel on top of the can and capture the Freon. We will put a hose on the small end of the funnel and run it to the input side of a pump, OK? So now the Freon is boiling rapidly (evaporating) in the can and getting cold and you are blowing the cool air on your face and the Freon is being captured by the inverted funnel and the pump is sucking all the Freon up and taking it away. So what should we do with it?<br>  <br>  Let's hook up the other end of the pump to an empty Freon can and stuff the gaseous Freon back into the can so we can save it (and the ozone layer). But we have a problem - as we capture the Freon gas and compress it, putting it back into the empty can we find that it is getting hot! Ahhhh, isn't physics beautiful?? If we let it expand and evaporate it gets cold - when we compress it it gets hot! There is some balance in nature after all. So, let's take another fan and blow it across the can we are using to capture the Freon gas and blow the hot air somewhere, but where? In our faces? NO, that would be silly. So let's blow it out the window. As a matter of fact, let's get reeeealy smart and move the compressor and the can we are using to capture the "used" Freon outside of the house. That way we can cool the inside of the house with the boiling (evaporating) Freon and reclaim the Freon and cool it outside the house. Hmmmm, beginning to sound familiar?<br>  <br>  But now we are faced with a dilemma. Soon we find the can of Freon that we started with becomes empty! We have run out of Freon! Buttt! We have a backup system, don't we? We have been faithfully collecting the gaseous Freon in the can outside the window, and since we have been cooling it by blowing outside air across the can we now have a tank of liquid Freon outside the house, and it is back to a reasonable temperature cuz we have been cooling it outside. So, let's go outside and get the can and bring it inside and begin our process over again, OK??<br>  <br>  But wait a minute, this is silly. Suppose I had a hole in the bottom of the outside can so that I could hook up a hose to it and run the hose back inside and connect it to the top of the inside Freon can?? Then the liquid Freon would be pushed back into the house by the force of the compressor and we could have a closed system where we would never run out of Freon, and the ozone layer would be safe!<br>  <br>  It is obvious I have been describing a typical air conditioning system, only we use some different terminology to describe the components. The can we had inside the house where the Freon is evaporating is called, are you ready for this? The evaporator! It is not a can, but rather it is a long aluminum tube about 3/8 inch in diameter and about ten feet long formed into a zigzag pattern. In your car, the evaporator unit is buried inside the heater air duct where the fan blows across it moving hot outside air across the coils and cooling it to blow inside the car. Attached to the tubing is a set of thin aluminum fins, all of which are designed to optimize on heat transfer or cool transfer if you will. The gaseous Freon coming out of the evaporator is captured by a hose which is connected to a pump - now called a compressor. The compressor is powered by a serpentine belt which is connected to the engine. So the work of cooling your car comes from the engine. The compressed Freon goes to a device which is similar in construction to the evaporator with tubing and fins. Here is where the Freon is condensed into a liquid again - the name of this part is, ready for this? The condenser coil! In an air conditioning system like you have in your car, the condenser is in front of the car radiator and the forward motion of your car causes air to flow across it cooling the gaseous and pressurized Freon sufficiently to change it back to a liquid state. The liquid Freon now flows back inside the car through a small tubing called the "expansion tube". On some cars this function is controlled by a valve called the expansion valve which can be regulated to control the cooling rate by controlling the amount of liquid Freon flowing back into the evaporator coils, however on most systems it is a tubing with a small inside diameter. This restriction is necessary to maintain a pressure difference between the evaporator coils and the condenser coils.<br>  <br>  Now that you understand the operating principles of an air conditioning system, you also know the operating system of your refrigerator, your freezer, and your dehumidifier. They all work on the same principle! Oh, I forgot to mention, this is the same operating principle that is used in a heat pump! All you have to do is put the condenser coil INSIDE the house and the evaporator coil OUTSIDE the house and you can heat the house instead of cooling it! That magic is done with a series of valves that reverses the flow of Freon.<br>  <br>  The main thing that happens to all automotive air conditioning systems is that it verrrry slowly looses Freon. A standard auto air system contains around three pounds of liquid Freon. When the Freon level drops a half pound or so you will notice a decrease in the cooling ability of the system. It's really pretty simple, you want the evaporator to be almost full of liquid Freon so that while it is boiling (evaporating) so that you get maximum cooling without returning liquid Freon to the compressor. If the system leak is small, a half pound in a few years, it is perfectly legal for a mechanic to "top it off" by adding sufficient Freon to fill the system to bring it back to its normal cooling capacity. Don't let an unscrupulous mechanic tell you that you have to have the system "pumped down" before refilling it again. Poppycock! Tell him to "top it off".<br>  <br>  Of course if the system has a major leak, like a ruptured hose or a hole in the condenser from an errant stone or an accident, then major repairs are needed and the repaired system will have to "pumped down" to eliminate any air and/or moisture from the system prior to refilling it.<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, when the system looses about a pound of Freon another thing happens that you should know about. Most automotive manufacturers have put in a safety mechanism so that if you lose all of your Freon you will not ruin your compressor by running it on an empty system. You see, there is also lubricating oil mixed in with the Freon - oil which lubricates the compressor's moving parts - oil which will blow out if you have a ruptured hose or other component. It is this safety factor which makes a lot of money for unscrupulous mechanics. They will point to the compressor and say it is broken cuz it ain't turning when it should be. What he didn't tell you is that it won't turn if you have lost enough Freon to cause the "low pressure switch" to disable the compressor clutch! Topping the system off will allow sufficient pressure in the system to allow the safety feature to let the clutch turn on when required! There is nothing wrong with the clutch!<br>  <br>  It is worth mentioning here that Freon 12, the kind of Freon we are talking about here, is no longer legal to be produced here in the USA so the cost of it has skyrocketed. What used to cost 79 cents for a 14 ounce can now costs close to 20 dollars a pound! And the cost will go higher! So don't let someone tell you you need a "pump-down" and a complete recharge when you can more than likely get away with a "top-off".<br>  <br>  If you are into DIY there is a clue in the above discussion about the "safety switch". I mentioned that there is oil mixed in with the Freon, remember? Well, it stands to reason that if there is a Freon leak, there is also an oil leak. That is a tell-tale. Look around the hose fittings for signs of oil leaking. If you have a pressure washer, thoroughly clean around all of the connections and the seals at the compressor shaft. Then run the system for a day or so, assuming it works at all, and look for signs of an oil leak. If you find one, tighten the fitting nearest the oil leak. If it is in the vicinity of the compressor seal you will have to fix the seal or replace the compressor.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have access to Freon tank and a hose kit, you can add oil to your system, if needed, by filling up the hose with a half ounce of oil and "shooting" it into the system along with a "top-off" of Freon. You don't need a special "oil injector" kit.<br>  <br>  I am frequently asked the question, "How much Freon do I add to 'top it off'"? The answer is you don't want liquid Freon getting back into the compressor cuz you can't compress a liquid and the compressor will object violently, like locking up or worse yet blowing a piston. So, how do you now when to stop? You feel the large cool tubing coming out of the evaporator and going back to the compressor. It will be VERY cold and water will condense on it when there is a small amount of liquid Freon coming out of the evaporator. That's when you stop adding Freon. Just keep feeling the tube and note the temperature drop as you add Freon. I have used this procedure for years and have never blown a compressor. You can go out and buy all the fancy gauges you want, but none of them will tell you when the system is full. Of course you could remove all the Freon from the system with a retrieval system that prevents the escape of Freon into the environment (illegal in most of the world) and then add the correct amount of Freon by specification. But at 20 bucks a pound that can run into big bucks fast. If you choose that route you will have to go to a professional who has the reclaim equipment unless you have a few thousand dollars to blow!<br>  <br>  Remember one thing about Freon. It is dangerous stuff. Whenever working with Freon containing components or Freon containers, WEAR SAFETY GLASSES! If one drop of liquid Freon were to get on your cornea (front surface of your eye) it WILL instantly freeze your cornea, causing PERMANENT VISION LOSS! This is serious business! Don't take chances with your vision. WEAR FULL COVERAGE SAFETY GLASSES WITH SIDE SHIELDS!|`|75f17f122686f2101d52944d5bfe995daa	should be the black one...one should be marked L for low pressure and the other should be H for high.

Or did you install the entire a/c system yourself? I will assume that you charged the a/c and now it doesnt work. You have either over or undercharged the system. You may have also cross charged it. Does your "J"etta have r-12 or r-134a freon in it? Did it have r-12 in it when you charged it with r-134a? Did you even think to check this before you decided to work on your own car? <br>    My suspicion is that you have a major leak in your a/c system and all your freon has leaked out. Either that or you have moisture in the system and it is freezing up on you. Either way you need to take the car to a qualified service center and have the a/c system evacuated. They will be able to tell if there is a leak in the system by doing this and if there is no leak then they will be able to remove the moisture so your system doesnt freeze up anymore. <br>    Cars are complicated these days and you should find a reputable shop you trust and have them do all your maintenance from now on.
KtlurIK8aa	Absolutely - or a fuel pump. Get it in now and get it checked.
KtlurIK8aa	Illinois passed a law making it illegal to "camp out" in the left hand lane. If you block traffic you can get a ticket no matter what the speed.<br>  <br>  It does aggravate me and the funny part is many of the people who sit in the left lane say they are doing the speed limit so they should not have to move as no one can legally go faster. I used to fume over this but now I try to be patient as many, many times I would be blocked by one of these people and about a mile further down the road would be a trooper who would have ticketed me had I not been held up by the slow poke. So I now silently thank these snails as they have saved my license many times. If they were smarter drivers they would move over and let speeders pass them by as the speeder might then get a ticket and would be off the road. So actually these "blockers" are being counter productive and not thinking the entire issue through clearly. They are helping the speeders, not hurting them.

aHlkrZazaa	With a Cavalier, if the engine computer detects an issue it will cut power to the other computers like your ETS (traction control).  If your engine was acting up in the wet first (you said you needed to dry the wires, so it rained?) I would start by checking the engine codes.  A number of things can cause surging, included but not limited to ignition, IAC, Fuel, or PCM problems.  If your check engine lite is not on than you probably just have a bad wheel speed sensor, causing your ETS to think one of your wheels has lost traction.  It will respond by reducing engine torque and messing with your shift points. This one is tough to go any further on without those codes.  BTW, you can't get ETS codes with most OBDII scanners, you may have to go to a garage (or tranny place).  Best of luck....|`|KtlurIK8aa	I would have the alternator output and battery checked as a start. If the alternator is over or under charging it can cause electronic problems like you described.

RjUhISEIaa	Rover...first and foremost, from an American, my thanks to you for the time you are about to give to your country in the Royal Navy. You are to be commended for this!<br>  <br>  "If" you can find a tramp steamer for sale the old saying goes that every item has it's price. I just tried using the Google and Yahoo search engines and could not find a single listing for one for sale. Doesn't mean it's not available but you just have to find one with an owner willing to let her go.<br>  <br>  But 20 years from now when you separate from the Royal Navy things could be ever so different. Keep the dream and see what the future holds in 18 years. That'll give you 18 years of being in the Navy and if your dream is still alive then you'll have 2 years to figure out what you're going to do to fulfill it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  |`|6HMTlQMaaa	How about finding a nice old diesel trawler, like a Nordhaven?|`|EWQncHVlaa	The owner does not need to know anything about ships, but the captain must have a masters certificate issued by a maritime authority.

8GDBr2U9aa	Yes, it's against the law if your car has plates that are not registered to it. A cop would run the plates and consider the vehicle stolen.|`|SuZbBnycaa	In California:  If the car is off public roads, then you can tell the DMV via Form REG 5090 Affidavit of NON-USE that you won't be using it. That takes car of the DMV    The Apt management can have rules about their parking lot you must follow.     Don't put someone else's plates on your car. That's illegal.   Or pay the Apt manager to look the other way for three weeks.  or move it to a private driveway or garage until you can get plates for it.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	its probably not against the law if you are not driving it on the street and it is NOT visible from a public street. if you are just using the plate to satisfy your apartment manager - seems ok to me. The apartment just doesn't want a bunch of abandoned junk vehicles parked or stored all over.|`|EopteDzsaa	using his plates is illegal b/c the vehicle isn't registered to him and those plates aren't for that car {by the way why does he still have the expired tags?} They should have been surrendered to the DMV    If you put those tags on your car you risk getting it towed.  The fact that you have it under a tarp may raise suspicion.  I had this problem also.  You should still be able to get it registered as long as you find an insurance co. to offer you coverage.  Progressive was the only one who would give me coverage with only a permit.  Try that, the rates aren't too bad, and if your not happy just switch companies when you do get your license.  Don't risk breaking the law and having your vehicle towed or impounded for no/improper registration.
hoykolriaa	Like you, I'd be very dubious about the claims that the amplifier you mention is  realistically  pushing out 350W RMS per channel, with only having a 20A fuse. It is very well known that low-end - never heard off amp manufacturers make unrealistic claims. I'm told at best that a class A/B amplifier can have a theoretically efficiency of 66%, and that of a class D having 95%. With the information you've supplied, even if we took an efficiency of 100%, you'd need at least a 30A fuse, current would be 25A.    Please refer to my source web - page, where audio installation experts suggest just to walk away, were such unreliable information is presented. on an amplifier. Look at point 3    http://www.the12volt.com/installbay/foru...    hope this information helps.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Yes. Watts as a measure of power will draw differing amounts of current dependant on the voltage it's driving, the amplifier's power requirements, etc, etc.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	The amperage of the fuse has nothing to do with the output of the amp.|`|b337f264d9542116059d28a7e5433cc3aa	The 350RMS is because the DC input is converted into an AC output signal (sine wave) to drive your speakers.    -12v through to +12v (probably 12.5v really)    so you have 25volts peak to peak x 20A = 500watts.    BUT you multiply it by 0.707 to get the RMS value. = 353watts
2OBP8fqJaa	I have lived in Colorado and Illinois for many years, driven in every kind of snow and ice hazard, and never had a wreck yet. It wasn't asked, but when I lived there, keeping weight such as a bag of sand in the trunk and extra blankets and emergency clothing is a good safety precaution. <br>  <br>  The sand helps to put more weight in the car and can be used to melt snow and give better traction if you get stuck. Also a small shovel to dig out. Warm clothes in case you do get stuck and have to wait a long period before help can get to you is imperative. My mom always asked me to have a few granola bars zip locked away.<br>  <br>  If you get stuck, don't race the tires over the snow. That only helps to ice pack the snow and make it slipperier. Learn how to "rock" your car back and forth by putting your car in reverse and forward quickly without tearing up your transmission. This rocking motion will increase your cars momentum and help you get out of being stuck. Again, don't spin your tires. It only makes it worse and icier. Also you can put sticks or flat rocks under your wheels to give them something to grab if they are available.<br>  <br>  The rate of speed on the freeways is dependant on the weather. If it's icy, find a route that has been plowed and salted. Don't drive where you cannot see the lanes!! If you can wait until it warms a little the salt will have had time to melt the ice and snow. <br>  <br>  Invest in some good wiperblades with "boots". Keep plenty of windshield fluid in your cars resevoir, or you won't be able to see through your windshield when when it gets slushed. Get an ice scraper with a brush at the end. Brush the snow off your headlights, taillights, and all your windows every time you drive and if it's left on the roof, it eventually slides off to your rear window or front windshield when you stop. Keep good visability and let your lights shine! <br>  <br>  Do not attempt to drive up steep hills or down them unless there is no ice and it has been well salted. Early morning hours are the most dangerous since you can't see the road well and they may not have been salted yet. neighborhoods with steep hills are some of the most dangerous since they are not main roads and are taken care of last.<br>  <br>  A lot of people drive too fast for conditions. Don't judge your rate of speed on the other drivers. Again, DO NOT judge your rate of speed on the other drivers and that goes for rain also. If you are driving slower, get out of the way and stay to the right to let them get by you. And stay away from crazy drivers as far as you can, since sliding can occur anytime.<br>  <br>  Go to a large empty parking lot and practice skidding. I always did and it really helps to learn how to maneuver. Turn into the skid. But learn to not over turn or you will skid the other direction.  Always, Always give lots of extra room between you and the car in front of you. One of the best safety tips you can learn! Stop slowly so as to avoid sliding. Don't slam on your brakes when you come to a stop. Pump your brakes a bit at a time to avoid sliding and give yourself plenty of room and foresight to stop at intersections. I hesitate to say this, but it is better to run a yellow in the snow, then to slam on your brakes. Just be more aware of light changes to avoid getting hit from the jerk behind you who didn't give you enough space. If you are stopping slowly and way ahead of time, the guy behind you will have plenty of notice and be less likely to hit you and push you into traffic.<br>  <br>  And in the Northern Illinois area, soda is called "pop". :c]|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well generally you should take your time, and drive slower than the posted speed limit.  If the car skids you want to break lightly and steer as needed.  Below are 7 tips to help you when driving in snow or icy conditions.  <br>  <br>  1. Get a grip. To have adequate snow traction, a tire requires at least 6/32-inch deep tread, according to The Tire Rack. (New passenger-car tires usually have 10/32-inch of tread.) <br>  <br>  2. Make sure you can see. Replace windshield wiper blades. Clean the inside of your windows thoroughly. Apply a water-shedding material (such as Rain-X) to the outside of all windows, including the mirrors. <br>  <br>  3.  Run the air-conditioner. In order to remove condensation and frost from the interior of windows, engage your air-conditioner and select the fresh air option: It's fine to set the temperature on "hot."<br>  <br>  4. Check your lights. Use your headlights so that others will see you and, we hope, not pull out in front of you. Make sure your headlights and taillights are clear of snow.<br>  <br>  5. Give yourself a brake. Learn how to get maximum efficiency from your brakes before an emergency. It's easy to properly use antilock brakes: Stomp, stay and steer.<br>  <br>  6. Watch carefully for "black ice." If the road looks slick, it probably is. This is especially true with one of winter's worst hazards: "black ice.<br>  <br>  7. Too much steering is bad. If a slick section in a turn causes your front tires to lose grip, the common â but incorrect â reaction is to continue turning the steering wheel.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Use this site it is very helpful and informative.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/default.asp?pgid=snowandice/winterTips&sid=about" rel="nofollow">http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/default.asp?p...</a>|`|cfba62be301f6ab7c54be6fabc482682aa	Snow isn't that much of a problem. Its when it turns to ice that its a problem.<br>  Never hit the brakes hard.<br>  Never speed. Go slower than the speed limit.<br>  If you skid on ice the only thing that will stop it is usually another car or a ditch.<br>  <br>  The bags of sand in the trunk only work if your driving a real wheel drive car. On a front wheel drive you don't want to take the weight off the front.|`|IRh79hO7aa	big car, lots of weight and snow tires. it will help with traction. but really go slow and keep moving.|`|42qWUbVZaa	<a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/WinterDriving/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/...</a>

3CA6gZQraa	you can do all that but you can also along with that there is a way to pump to your throttle control to release more oil into the engine coating internal parts and fogging the engine this prevents corrosion build up|`|nAzbLdBCaa	First, consult your owners manual under storage procedures.  The answers so far all offer something, but as a mechanic for 35 years, I know that there are somethings on every motor that you need to pay particular attention too.  It's not so much about anti-freeze but everything to do with lubrication. I recommend using the fuel as opposed to storage till next year,   Don't leave fuel in the carb.  "fog the engine with "fogging oil"  not by "pumping the throttle, also it's only effective on a hot engine, so run the engine until it's at operating condition.

The 6k miles doesn't make a difference.  Both should still have factory warranty remaining.  Both should be financed the same since 1 year apart wont make a difference in interest rates either. <br>  <br>  I'd buy the one that looks nicer, has the right color combination and the one that simply "feels" right.  Get nit-picky if you like them both.  I'm sure there's a warn out spot on a seat, a nick on the dash, a scratch near the door handle or a stain in the trunk that will set one apart from the other. <br>  <br>  Of course all of this is contingent upon the fact that you have inspected these cars and they are bother free of flaws and mechanical issues.

However, the brakes can be a little sharp, the engine is very noisy and the gear box can be a little clunky. It's a good car if you get a good deal on the 0% APR.

1ng3laKLaa	I can already tell u that just by reading this do not expect much. Not much at all. $1,156 Would probably be the very max that some1 would buy this car for.

That means they'd expect the car to cost you money to have towed off.    http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingR...    The car needs over $600 of repairs according to the seller to get it running.  In running condition it's only worth $1200.  It's going to be tough to get anyone to take a gamble on a car that needs 50% of it's value put into repairs to probably get it running you're going to have trouble giving it away.  Remember you're basically asking for $600 for someone to take it away for free as that's what it needs to be basic transportation and even that's just a guess.
hktfe1UGaa	F-22 Hands Down. The F-22 is the only 5th Generation Fighter in the world currently. Russia, China , and South Korea are working on their own, but not only is the F-22 the only operational 5th Gen Fighter, from what reports state, it is still better than what the other Nations will achieve themselves. Which means by the time any Nation comes up with a Fighter that can match our F-22, we will already be on to better versions or a 6th Gen Fighter ourselves.    I could sit here for an hour and type out all the reasons why the F-22 is far far better than the F-14 , but there is no reason to. I will provide links to the information and you can come to that conclusion on your own. LoL    "Pilsnerman", the F-14 does still fly, just not for the United States anymore. LoL, well since Iran doesn't count really, then I guess your statement is right.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Well, it would come down to what type of fight you mean:  Pre-merge  Merge  Post-merge  The Raptor could easily schwack a Tomcat pre-merge with Slammers, without the Tomcat knowing it was there (let alone getting ready to fire).  The Tomcat's RHAW gear might pick up a Slammer if it went active, but there wouldn't be much it could do (chaff, maneuvering primarily).  The Tomcat would also be disadvantaged as E2, Mainstay (Iranian F14s), or GCI would have difficulty maintaining track on the F22; thus denying them crucial situational awareness.  The Tomcat's radar, beast that it was, would be well in the Raptor's frequency range for Low-Observable.  Their EO system could get a VID, but without knowing exactly where to point the nose-it's like looking through a soda straw.  In the merge (this is what most folks mean by a "dogfight"), things would even up-a bit.  If the Tomcat crew is on their game, they can avoid being suckered into high-G maneuvers that the Raptor can easily make.  A Raptor could easily get in a high-Pk position in a single-scissors (well, so could a Viper, Hornet, Typhoon, Grypen, Fulcrum, Flanker...)The Raptor's vaunted "stealth" is almost (but not quite) useless in a visual fight. If the F14's radar still can't lock, the crew won't get good firing solutions for guns, or radar missiles. If the Raptor pilot is a newbie, without much dogfighting experience, it's POSSIBLE that the Tomcat could get a shot in.  Another issue of the Tomcat, one I saw when training with them in the F4, is that you can tell their G-availability by their wing-sweep: high sweep, lots of G, little sweep, G is pissed away-important information.  Post-Merge assuming the Tomcat has survived, its best maneuver would be to separate (get away).  Else the Raptor will easily gain an advantaged position over the F14 and mort it.|`|sLx0y8aLaa	f-22 is the best aircraft out there for stability maneuverability and control ability if you have those three you are way more safer to do what you want|`|ruenEu8Yaa	thats like asking:  who would win, a baby or chuck norris...

addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Box shaped cars have the most space.  A 7 foot person could sit in one comfortably.  It has more space than a Ford Explorer.    It accelerates slowly. It is an economy compact car. Less than 150HP.    If you think a car as slow as the Pontiac Vibe is quick, then you should like the Scion xB. It is basically a Toyota Corolla with a different body and a little more power.

I don't think you want to make it.  It should be pretty cheap, I think I get it for about $3.00 for a gallon or so.  If you really HAVE to make it (if, for whatever reason, you can't afford it, or don't have a store nearby.), I would use about a pint of window cleaner and a pint of water.  Mix it first, then pour into the reservoir in the engine compartment.
10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	I don't think so, I read somewhere many years back, that is was a stock 500S.  Hoover didn't add much stress to the aircraft, he knew how to fly it! Anyone who can pour tea into a glass while doing a roll, isn't over stressing anything!  (that video is on the web in many places)    I had the privilege of seeing this aircraft in action. I saw Bob on downwind midfield, cut both engines, land, and rollout, stoping on the runway directly in front of the crowd - that, is skill!  "His signature maneuver was a deadstick loop, eight-point roll, and 180-degree turn back to the runway followed by a touchdown with first one main wheel and then the other, and wrapping up by rolling powerless back to airshow center. "    OH I found a reference for you  http://twincommander.minisoft.us/prev_ar...  ".... Hoover's Shrike had just two modifications other than its smoke system. An hydraulic accumulator in the baggage compartment held hydraulic pressure so Hoover could extend the gear when the airplane was upside down and the engines feathered. It also provided Hoover with nosewheel steering following his deadstick landing and rollout.    The second mod was an automatic unfeathering system. Hoover would shut down the engines by pulling the prop controls to Feather position while leaving the throttles and mixture controls in place. To restart, he would advance the prop levers, tripping microswitches on electric pumps that unfeathered the props so they would windmill and restart."|`|4bGQpFB3aa	Pure stock.  As was the Sabreliner he used overseas, that was the selling point.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Bob Hoover's Commander was a bone stock aircraft and was a 'working' aircraft between airshows. It had to earn it's keep like any other corporate aircraft.   The Commander is quite capable of performing the stunts that Hoover put it through as it rolled out the factory door.     About the only mod that was done was to add the cupholder so that he could pour ice tea while inverted.
XQvWjkrSaa	You are correct!  Drying is usually the number one culprit in scratching or swirling your car.  I suggest two things to minimize your risk.  The first think is to keep a good, high quality wax on the paint.  I suggest GuruWax by DetailingGurus.com.  This wax sheets water very well.  After washing, most of the water will simply fall off if you sheet it without a nozzle.      The second thing you want to do is to use a blower of some kind (electric leaf blower, shop vac exhaust or compresses air) to blow off most of the water.  This should remove 90%+ of the water is the car is waxed with a high quality wax like GuruWax.    Last, go over it with a high quality microfiber drying towel like the GuruFiber 360XL or the GuruFiber Waffle Weave towel.  These super soft towels will get your car 100% dry and are ultra plush and soft and will protect from scratches and swirls.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if your at the car wash and washing it by hand then use spot free rinse.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Danpon probably has the best advice to put off the inevitable but I've got better.    Accept the inevitable.  You're going to get swirls putting that fancy wax on it anyway.  It's not the towel you're using, it's microscopic pieces of dirt.  If you're using anything that actually touches the car to wash, dry or wax the car you can't stop it.      Your fear is about the same as being afraid of the sun rising tomorrow.  It's going to happen no matter what you do to try to prevent it.|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I heard that the ShamWoW towels work really well on your car.|`|IUEZzmfyaa	There are several ways to protect that new car shine. One of the culprits that tends to cause scratching is road dirt and tiny particles that embed themselves in the wax.   One of the best ways to care for that black car is to learn how to do it properly.  There are several companies that now sell claybars, these are bars of clay, as implied, that when used with a high quality detailing spray, remove those particles easily. Go to any website such as www.meguire's.com for information and complete directions on how to best care for your car. A little research and a bit of effort on your part, will maintain that "New Car" look for years to come.

Nothing is going to fit.  Nothing is going to match up.    You would need to fabricate and install new motor mounts.  You may need to modify the frame. You would need to swap the electrical system and make a custom wiring harness.    You would need access to a shop with enough fabrication equipment to make and install all of the parts you would need.  You would need the fabrication and mechanical skills to make the swap yourself.    Seeing you had to ask this question in the first place I doubt that you have these fabrication and mechanical skills.  You would need to pay someone else to do this for you.  The going rate for work like this is about $100 per hour.  I would estimate about 80 hours labor requires for all of this custom work costing about $8000.  You would still need to come up with an engine which will cost well over $1000.    You could buy a pretty nice ATV for $9000
6xyeYjkkaa	A hood can be replaced if worse comes to worst. Rust in window and door hinge areas is much more serious. If the rust is on the doors then they can be replaced. If the rust damage is in the body area around the hinges then it's much more expensive to repair. Bad rust damage is never "easy" nor "cheap" to repair, but some is worse than others. I'd suggest you try to find a body man who will look at the car for you and give you an honest estimate of whether it's worth the effort or not. I've seen some amazing restorations of some real rust buckets, but there is a point where the value of the car doesn't make it worth while.|`|AA10331789	If you just want to drive it for a few years rather than restore it, simply coat the rust with the rust converter below and then paint over with matching body paint.

RjUhISEIaa	jtexas and truenorth have given you excellent advice and there are indeed many, many more things to look for when buying a used vessel. The links below will take you to two of many sites, found by Googling "buying a used boat."<br>  <br>  Do your homework upfront!!! Remember...there is no such thing as a dumb question...only the dumb answer the owner will give you!|`|U24VtSlZaa	Here's a few things that you should consider absolute deal-breakers, no matter the price:<br>  1.  if boats in your state/province have titles, and the owner doesn't have the title, run don't walk as fast as you can in the opposite direction.  outboard motors in my state have a separate title from the boat, but boat trailers don't.  <br>  2.  if it's on a trailer, ask the owner to crank the engine for you.  If he does so without supplying water to the lower unit (outboard or stern drive), walk away -- he doesn't know what he's doing.  It only takes 30 - 45 seconds dry running to damage the water pump.<br>  3.  Check the transom for soft spots.  If it's an outboard, tilt it up far as it'll go, grasp the lower unit & give it a good shake -- transom should not flex at all.  Give a few taps with a screwdriver or something, listen for a hollow sound.  Soft transom means "project boat".<br>  4.  Compression test the motor.  If the lowest isn't within 7 percent or so of the highest, walk away.<br>  <br>  Get a test drive if you can -- engine should start quickly, idle for long periods, accelerate without bogging, cruise at full throttle for long periods.<br>  <br>  Can't get a lake test, discount the price substantially and add a spark test to the compression test -- most modern marine ignitions should jump a 7/16" gap outside the cylinder on an inline spark tester.  You can't judge how well an engine will perform under load by listening to it run on a garden hose attachment.<br>  <br>  Accessories not working is a pretty minor issue for anyone who's handy (and you better be if you're buying a used boat).  Maybe fishfinders & navionics can get pretty expensive.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	This is an extremely open ended question. Myself and I am sure many others here in the forum could write a book on this subject.<br>  <br>  Private owners are tough, some are honest, others are looking to unload a lemon.<br>  <br>  My first piece of advice is to take a friend or trusted family member with you. Anything to help with some information and education.<br>  <br>  How are you going to use the boat?<br>  <br>  What are the hours on the engine? And don't let the owner give you some crap about not having an hourmeter. If you can't find it right away, look around. Has it ever been sunk?<br>  <br>  Does the boat look in good condition? Are there soft spots in the floor? If the hull looks abused, that most likely means the engine was too.<br>  <br>  What does the prop and skeg look like? If the skeg is gone, walk away. Did the owner have the decency to change the beat up prop? Look for the little things that signify a less than conscientious boat owner.<br>  <br>  Drive it. And really take it for a ride.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. Have fun.|`|EFKqkdouaa	Look at the condition of the fabric in the seats and carpeting. Look for signs of sun damage and neglect. If the interior is neglected the motor probably was as well. Ask about the hours on the motor and some have hour meters.

AA11599219	I'm a big fan of catamarans, but when buying another boat, I went with a mono hull just because they are so much cheaper on the used market.<br>  <br>  Why they are expensive in my mind:<br>  <br>  Any fiberglass boat requiers materials and engineering that are much more expensive than the 3-story "mansion" you mentioned.   If you had to build a three story home out of fiberglass and teak with every surface curved instead of squared off instead of standard pine and drywall, it would be much more expensive too.<br>  <br>  Catamarans are more complex in design and require more fiberglass for any given length than a monohull.<br>  <br>  Catamarans have only become popular on North America recently so there is a much larger used market for monohulls than for catamarans.   An increased supply tends to drive prices down, especially in today's economy.<br>  <br>  However there are a few catamaran brands that while still more expensive than comprable monohulls often come on the market at a price many could afford.  Two that come to mind with very different characteristics are the Catalac 8 & 9 M as well as the Iriquois.   The Catalac is a heavier displacement, extremely stable boat.   The Iriquois is much more of a cruiser/racer that is much less stabable.  Personally, I wouldn't get an Iroquois due to their capsize history, but it all depends on your use and what's important to you.|`|RjUhISEIaa	a 3 story mansion on 100 acres for $350,000? Where?

AA12119772	Either the MAF or leaky vacuum lines, or both. Try MAF cleaner (spray can, made by CRC) before throwing more parts at it. Change mechanics too, they're too happy taking your money for not fixing it.<br>  Then you should visit this free, community-run car forum:<br>  <a href="http://newbeetle.org" rel="nofollow">http://newbeetle.org</a><br>  Make sure you know what codes (#s) the car's thrown, as to help our members help you diagnose this. It's a very friendly site, has helped me with a few little things with my '98.<br>  So HAVE they changed your O2 sensor? That's how I read your description. But if you haven't changed it, it's quite possible to get this kind of symptoms from the O2 sensor as well. It's usually the pre-catalyst one, and they can have these weird 'off-again, on-again' symptoms. Come by the .org and we'll (try our best to ) help you sort it out :)|`|AA10561878	catalytic converter.or muffler restriction.|`|NHU59SBfaa	((Please read to the bottom))Sounds like they've covered most of the bases, however it sounds to me like a fuel pressure or volume issue. The fact that your car loses power under load, ( going up hills) indicates its not getting the required amount of fuel to supply the engine under these circumstances. This can be several different things. I would change the fuel filter first, in case it is plugged or contaminated to the point of restricting fuel flow. ( Its a good idea to change a filter every 30k or so anyway ) Then have the fuel pressure checked to verify all is well. And the final culprit would be the fuel pump. ( the fuel pressure test should help you diagnose the pump ).  The o2 sensor code it is setting can be a result of a lean air/fuel ratio caused by a fault in the fuel system.|`|oqX2EL4kaa	Strongly suspect incorrect Air Mass Meter readings.<br>  Engine ECU relies on the Air Mass Meter to measure the volume of air entering the intake system and then adjusts fueling accordingly. Air Mass is also used by VW to assess engine load, which will be greater under load ( uphill/hard acceleration etc ) The reason why oxygen sensor faults are logged is that the engine ECU thinks "X" amount of air is entering the engine when in fact "Y" is, this then means that the resultant lean or rich mixture picked up at the lambda probe goes against what it expects and hence the fault code. <br>  A simple test would be to find a particular spot where the loss of power is pronounced and consistently occurs. Once you have a feel for how it performs over this spot, stop the car and disconnect the air mass meter (4 pin connector usually in the trunking near the air filter).<br>  Now rerun the test drive - expect the vehicle to be flatter in all driving but if the vehicle has more power than before in the place where it lost it then this indicates that the meter is faulty. The reason behind this is that with no Air mass signal the engine ECU adopts a fixed value which invariably gives a better fueling solution to on load situations.An exchange Air mass meter is usually around ï¿¡60-90 in the uk if available - or try German and swedish for a patent part. They are also easy to fit, 20 mins tops even for a begginer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
RjUhISEIaa	Victor<br>  <br>  Been boating the Potomac for more years than I want to remember and I hate to say this but I don't know of anywhere in our area that rents boats.<br>  <br>  Know it's not the answer you wanted to hear but sadly is the only one I have to give...
RjUhISEIaa	Jad...for the past 20 years I have owned 2 Chaparrals. The first was a 2550SX cuddy cabin built/purchased in 89 and the 2nd is a 330 Signature build in 2004. <br>  <br>  The 89 gave us worry free boating until we moved up to the 330. When the day came to sell her I put her on Craigslist and had about a dozen people all wanting to buy her. Why? She looked new! Gelcoat held up beautifully over the years, canvas was in great shape, interior looked like new and the engine ran w/o a problem and had no rust on her at all. She was a great, and I mean truly great boat for us. But we outgrew her and moved up to the 330.<br>  <br>  The 330 is a dream to own and drive! If you pickup the 290 you're going to love it. Go for it and you'll see exactly what I mean. The only way you might be happier would be to move into a 310 or 330 but there is absolutely nothing wrong with owning a 290.<br>  <br>  Good luck and welcome to the Chaparral family!|`|dKBE7Cf0aa	I worked for a marina that sold these boats and spent alot of time rigging and testing them out in the water.The construction of these boats is very sound.They are a very good quality boat.All of the parts used in the building of these boats is very good.When you are on the water they handle nice so if you are choosing between the 2 there is no<br>  comparison,the Chaparral is a much better boat for your money.I hope this helps and good luck.

However, may old tanks are not that accessible.<br>  <br>  Many boaters, give up on their old tanks for drinking water and use it more for washing, etc.  You can also install a water filter on a dedicated tap for drinking water.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|RjUhISEIaa	Happens to us all and it's an easy fix.<br>  <br>  Run all of the water out of the tank...absolutely bone dry.<br>  <br>  Fill it back up and run it out again...bone dry.<br>  <br>  Fill it up 1/2 way...add water treatment chemicals...fill it back up.<br>  <br>  That's it and remember it will go stale if 1) no chemicals in the tank and 2) if not used for some time even with the chemicals in there.<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: can't remember the name of the water treatment we use but you can buy a box of maybe 10.

If not you can open your tank and fish them out.------------its 30 minuets later  now.  AND I put some brown sugar in some gas and it wont dissolve. Didn't think it would.

Deal with it like the young adult you are and report the boy. Let others deal with him so you can hopefully begin the process of growing up and getting ready to lead a productive life. If you are not able to do this on your own then it is suggested, and strongly, that you discuss this with your family and ask that they assist.

379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You bought a salvage title car. I would say it is suffering from the damage done. Lemon laws only apply to new cars, not used. I would guess that the damage was a lot more than a "bump in the back".|`|qtpuOf7Oaa	A car has to be declared a total loss by an insurance company aka totalled to be a salvage title, which gets rebuilt and turned into a rebuilt title.<br>  <br>  Lemon laws depend on the state, but if you bought it AS-IS you are out of luck. The state forces them to have a salvage title for a reason, they consider that enough notice to you that the car might be bad. How much did you pay for it?|`|PUTpBHliaa	Typically, if your car is 7 years old or newer with under 75k it can be covered by some sort of lemon law. Lemon laws are different for each state. If you have a car with a salvage title/rebuilt/manufacturer buyback listed on the title, it is automatically disqualified because that is basically telling you that your car has had either a total loss accident. Or your car had major defects and is now considered a lemon with a stamped lemon title or manufacturer buyback history. I'm guessing your car is an automatic transmission. These cars are known to have problems. I would sell it as-is repairable and move on. You may be able to call your local Ford dealer and ask them if there are any open recalls on your car. Depending on where you live, they may be able to cover it free of charge if there are open recalls. Good luck with this!

AA11432856	Sounds like a reasoning  exercise <br>  <br>  Your question does not tell us if you have to use the boat or how wide the pond is.   The best test taking advice ever given is R.T.W.Q (read the whole Question) is the objective to get the sand across the pond?  Or to figure out a way to use the boat within the guidelines and   restrictions given.  <br>  <br>  In your version of the question the three main points are <br>  <br>  1.  A unit of measure.-- In this case a cup (a quantity) of sand.<br>  2.  A boat --But you do not state that you have to use the boat       <br>       just  that you have one and it can't be motorized or pushed <br>  3.  A theoretical pond--- Theoretically  it could be only a few feet to the other side <br>  <br>  Given these variables I would place the cup of sand in a sealed container and throw it across the pond, the objective to get a cup of  sand across has been accomplished, and I didn't use a motor.push the boat or had anything on the bank to assist<br>  <br>  If  the question states there is a cup, a boat and a pond  you  tightly pack the sand into the cup and throw the cup across objective still met and you used the cup.|`|RjUhISEIaa	let's see...<br>  <br>  a pond is usually round, right?<br>  <br>  get a measuring cup out of the cupboard...fill it...then walk around the pond and deliver the cup of sand....but that's not what you're looking for, right?<br>  <br>  rubber bands assume you have a prop on the boat...do you?<br>  <br>  why not just raise a sail and let the wind take it over...|`|AA10137828	1. Take cup of sand, place in boat.<br>  2. Put boat on trailer, and remove from pond.<br>  3. Drive to other side of pond.<br>  4. Put boat back in water.<br>  5. Remove cup of sand!<br>  <br>      It's simple!<br>  <br>  Actually, I don't remember exactly how to do it, but I do know you can use chips of soap (bar bath soap) to propel a boat. The soap causes the surface tension of the water to "break up" and allows the boat to scoot along. <br>  |`|x0b6Kdy9aa	A pond can be 5 feet or 100 feet.  Either way, using a rubber band would work, but would not get you very far.  If you have to make a working model, or just an explaination,  I would think of a water wheel, where a hopper drops the sand into a wheel, dumping the sand in the hull of the boat.  It would sort of work like an hour glass.  You use the sand's weight to propel the wheel.  You can always use rubber bands as a back up power.  Fun project.  |`|BKxIL8YLaa	Twisting a rubber band along the shaft of the propellor would produce some impetus, however a cup of sand is quite heavy, the the boatmay not go very far at all...  If you knew the direction of the wind you could make a sail, or does the boat have to go from one specific point to another.<br>  <br>  How wide is the pond...?<br>  Elastic bands would be the simplest option, but you could even use basic chemical reactions like baking soda and vinegar to propel the craft, but again this is far more complicated than the nice elastic band!<br>  <br>  The basic way that everyone seems to do this is by creating a u shape in the back of the boat frame, and then twisting an elastic band between these and adding a paddle.<br>  <br>  Here are a few links for you to consider....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/applytech/at/elastep1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.shaw.ca/applytech/at/elas...</a>|`|NwHRr3ieaa	lets see Kilo and Boat'n VA  have accomplished  the task and got  the sand to the other side without the aid of a motor  or other devise .<br>  <br>  <br>  hummmmmmmm  Macgyver fans possibly |`|15V6xySOaa	Tie an extention cord from your dog to the boat and throw a steak across the pond.<br>  Or you could get your wife or kids to paddle across using spatulas. even your aunt or uncle.|`|fb0eaf36ce1e5d94009f64f30cd0f57daa	Yes...using rubber bands...|`|EswFkUVxaa	andrews liver salts the whole tin full
AA12252493	No need,  cold weather will not hurt your battery .... as long as it is kept fully charged.   As a matter of fact, cold weather will preserve your battery indefinitely .... the self discharge rate will go down to almost nothing at low temperatures .... After all,  chemical reactions drastically slow down as the temperature declines... and self-discharging is just a chemical reaction. As long as the battery starts out charged, it cannot freeze and cold weather will not hurt it.   BUT ..... if you should run your battery down and do  not immediately recharge it fully, then it might freeze and be ruined.  |`|553nyaVNaa	If you are worried about something in the camper draining the battery you could disconnect it and just leave it in place.

Storage of any battery outside in the winter will reduce it's life.  If you use it in your RV that's ok, in fact I had good luck running using marine battery's in my two vans, during the winter then putting them in the boat as needed. If your not going to use them then put a maintenance charger on them.  Good luck!|`|HszERr61aa	it doesn't drain it,but the colder it gets the less efficient a battery will be.so i suggest you keep it inside |`|RjUhISEIaa	yep...<br>  <br>  why not just take it inside and store it on a piece of wood? then add a trickle charger to it periodically|`|I7NkFJo2aa	There is no approved way of having a battery inside with humans.  The battery can release Hydrogen gas as a by-product of charging, this is highly explosive and is why approved batteries and gas storage systems are kept in externally vented compartments of campers, RV's boats etc.  You would probably have no insurance if you moved a battery indoors.<br>  <br>  Yes, all batteries can vent, no matter what they claim.  If they cannot they will probably burst in overcharge situations.  Alternator regulators can and do fail causing the battery to try and absorb way over it's safe voltage - I just had that happen to me and I consider myself pretty aware, the destroyed (new!) battery made me aware in no uncertain terms, it took less than a couple of hours and the battery was fried.  New voltmeter with the new regulator...<br>  <br>  The trickle charger idea will keep the battery in top shape, and is the best way to protect in cold weather, there are very good fully automatic ones that are not that expensive, about the cost of a battery maybe?  Be very cautious of cheap Chinese type units, a couple have caused fires on local boats in recent years.<br>  <br>  If you look up your battery spec.s on the manufacturer's website, you will find a chart giving the performance at various temperatures, and the potential capacity at various temperature points.  There will also be recommended charge rates and cycles for the battery type you have - if the manufacturer does not supply this info I would be astonished, also if you can't get this info then use another brand that does give you this info.  This will allow you to choose a battery of correct capacity for your application so you will not have too much of a worry.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  I fit these units a lot now - nil warranty returns so far <a href="http://www.ctek.com/EN-US/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctek.com/EN-US/Default.aspx</a>
AA11432856	All of the above reasons  are correct but the one underlying reason is Economic. For a Dying port that needs to generate revenue adding  boat  slips is the easiest option. <br>  The municipality owning the port would double benefit  1,    the revenue generated from slip rentals and 2 the additional  taxes collected|`|ZEwAalKPaa	When business as a commercial port drops off to uneconomic levels about the only other option is to becaome a marina.|`|RjUhISEIaa	I am leaning towards Matt's answer being the most correct.<br>  <br>  However, I have slipped a boat in a marina who did not dredge the bottom and at low tide you either did not have enough water to get out of your slip or found it leaning to one side or the other. <br>  <br>  Additionally, the marina we are currently slipped in has no laundry facility at all so that's out and most in our area do not have this at all (and we're just outside of Washington, DC). We do have a bath house though and I guess you could wear you clothes into the shower. : ) And if saying washing for cleaning the boat, welp, again ours has none either.<br>  <br>  Economic reasons could come into play though. Ports, smaller ones, may not be used as often as the major ports. Case in point would be Alexandria, VA that once upon a time was a small port on the Potomac River. Now though with trucks and rail serving the area it has lost it's appeal to river traffic and has turned to converting to a marina with transient slips available for those who want to come to sight see the area. <br>  <br>  The are many reasons why this could happen and the list would be as lengthy as there are ships and boats on the waters. Let your imagination go wild and chances are you're hitting on various reasons why this would happen.|`|m7O6lHyhaa	Nothing to do with economic reasons.<br>  <br>  Although a marina is more expensive to stay in than a port, it offeres alot more facilities.<br>  <br>  A marina is an encloded body of water that usually has lock gates to allow boats in and out.<br>  <br>  A harbour or port is just a protected area of water. Usually protected from weather seas by a large wall, with a gap some place in the wall to allow boats to come in and out.<br>  <br>  A marina offers access to your boat at all times, as there are usually pontoon and they never empty all of their water. Having these pontoons mean that you have access to your boat no matter weather the tide is in or out, shore electrical supply, fresh water supply and normally good washing facilities. A harbour can supply these, but they are much harder to obtain and gain access to than a marina.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Matt....x<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay thanks for the answer "boatin in va", i can now see some of factors which could cause financial reasons to come into play, thanks...|`|1jyFJRLUaa	Wouldn't it be that if berths are supplied for boats to dock at for periods of time make a port become a marina?

While smaller ferries that operate across rivers and other short distances still often have built-in ramps, the term RORO is generally reserved for larger ocean-going vessels.

elp9j6LWaa	My word!  You aren't even *close* to affording a 27' boat at $40k/year!  Not if you want to use it, anyway.<br>  <br>  Dear, trust me on this.  The only things you can ever buy on credit, that equal or exceed one year's income, are a house, or a business.  That's it.  No cars, no boats, and generally, no aircraft either.  Nothing that depreciates or uses massive amounts of fuel at $4+/gal.<br>  <br>  Sure, dear, with a nice boat you'll look rich and special to people who don't know better.  But those same people will laugh you out of town when the repo man visits and you have no boat, and no credit to get a smaller one.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to get one you can afford, like the $5000 sunset guy said.  If you keep doing that, you'll find that your careful spending habits suddenly allow you to *own* more expensive cars and boats.   As years pass, you'll have better and better ones, and they will be yours.|`|RjUhISEIaa	You "may" be able to qualify for this boat but I'd talk to the lenders first as the 675 is a little on the low side. If you were to put 10k down and finance the balance at 6.9% for 20 years you'd have a payment of about $540 per month. <br>  <br>  Now, if the Chaparral (beautiful and well built boat too!) has a built in head and small galley you may under IRS guidelines be able to right off the interest on her as a 2nd home. Note though that you would have to own a 1st home to be able to do this.<br>  <br>  Suggestion: don't go for the $5,000 used boat. Stay in the same Chaparral product line and look for a used 250 or larger. There are many great deals out there on good and solid used vessels and there is no need to plunk down a bunch of money that gets you saddled into a higher payment. Shop around...you'll be glad that you did. <br>  <br>  This is coming from experience with almost the same situation you are looking at. We bought an 89 2550SX Chaparral, kept her for 15+ years and then purchased a "nearly new," two season old, 2004 330 Chaparral Signature cruiser. We saved over $40k by buying the 330 over the price of a new one. The deals are definitely out there and especially at this time of this year when banks are repo'ing the vessels. <br>  <br>  Good luck and stay with the Chaparral line...you'll definitely be glad that you did!<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: thanks Richard for the kudo! Appreciate it!<br>  <br>  TO POSTER: you're only looking for suggestions on a boat name now? That's a far different question than the one you posted to begin with. But to answer it...the sky is the limit as to what she gets named and only limited to your imagination. One key thing to remember that if equipped with a VHF radio the name has to be easy to state and understand and of course "clean" when said over the airwaves. Keep it short and easy to understand and you'll do great. You can also Google "boat names" and find sites that will give you a list of those that have been sent in. Ours is called the "m & m" after my wife (Marilyn) and me (Mike). Our first was "JESEKA" after our three kids (Jennifer, Sean and Kathleen).

Yes it's a great boat, but now is not the time to purchase this boat.  You can save big bucks by waiting.  Financing is tight right now, and the interest is to high on boats.  Don't be fooled by "buy downs" it cost you in the long run.  you'll understand better in just a few years.  Think of it another way...don't buy if you can't carry the total cost yourself.

A visit to the boat owner from some rather large friends of mine solved the problem. Yet I strongly suggest you take legal advice. I think what you are looking for is a "Workers Lien" and I believe under maritime law the vessel can be arrested at its "next port of call" untill monies owing are paid. This also happened to the boat owner in my case as he owed other people money for work done.

RjUhISEIaa	Randy...you've got three good answers so far but here's some more info.<br>  <br>  Before winterizing...change the oil!<br>  <br>  You can buy a winterizing tank at Boater's World (<a href="http://www.boatersworld.com/product/178050035.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.boatersworld.com/product/1780...</a> or West Marine (<a href="http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/producte/10001/-1/10001/45454/377%20710/0/winterizing%20kit/Primary%20Search/mode%20matchallpartial/0/0?N=377%20710&Ne=0&Ntt=winterizing%20kit&Ntk=Primary%20Search&Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial&Nao=0&Ns=0&keyword=winterizing%20kit&isLTokenURL=true&storeNum=5000&subdeptNum=4&classNum=555)" rel="nofollow">http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/sto...</a> and it comes with instructions on what to do. Follow the instructions to the letter. <br>  <br>  After winterizing the engine...pop the plug wires and back out the plugs one at a time. Order up some fogging fluid while getting the kit above and spray a shot into the plug hole and replace the plug and repeat 7 more times. Once all are done turn your ignition key for about 2-3 seconds only to spread the fogging fluid up and down the cylendar walls.<br>  <br>  As for the head if plumbed drain the water from all lines. You then can either order online (or p/u at an RV dealership) what we endearingly call "pink chit" and pour it into your water holding tank. Run the water again until pink liquid comes out. Do the same for both hot and cold (drain and run) for this will drain water from the hot water tank if you have one and run the winterizing fluid into the hot water tank. On our boat I buy 2 cases and this is enough to winterize all of our water systems (galley, head, aft cabin and cockpit sink). Twelve bottles is what it takes for our 33' cruiser.<br>  <br>  Couple all the response you get here and you'll be in good shape!<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: Mark T gives great step-by-step instructions on how to winterize the boat. His avenue of spraying the fogging fluid into the carb is an alternative to what I suggested of spraying it into the block after backing out the plug. Either is an acceptable practice.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	If you have never done it before take it to a pro and have them do it.<br>  <br>  Will cost about $200 and it is worth it.<br>  <br>  If you goof and crack a block the repair will be in the neighborhood of $5000 to $6000.<br>  <br>  It is cheap insurance.|`|946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	Very easy to do.

Warm up the engine by hooking up the flush out attachment to the lower unit and a garden hose, let it run with the water on for 5 minutes. Do not start it until the garden hose is turned on! Hook up the 5 gallon container to the flush out attachment with the clear hose provided. Fill the container with a/f and place it on the transom. Put the flush out on the lower unit over the water intakes. Open the valve on the 5 gallon container so the a/f flows, it will drip a lot until you start the engine. get the flame arrestor of the engine and start it up. It will take that 5 gallons quickly so act fast. Start shooting the fogging spray into the air intake after 1 gallon of a/f is sucked in. Shoot the spray until the engine dies out if you can, or at least until it smokes a lot. Very important that you do not let the engine run out of the non-tox a/f. It will have enough in it when you see the a/f running out of the exhaust and it does not look diluted, so shut the engine down when you reach that point. spray the engine down with silicone spray to keep it from corroding. <br>  Then you also have to winterize any system that has water in it: fresh water, head, salt water wash down, etc. You should also change the engine oil beforeyou winterize the engine, and the lower unit oil.

This boat was boatel kept and not only did the boat look brand new but so did the 454 Merc. Not a bit of rust on her at all and ran like a top. The tandem axle trailer was "weathered" but in sound shape as she was rarely used. Just throwing this in so you can compare the two.<br>  <br>  You're talking about a boat that's now 37 years old, total interior restoration and some fiberglass work needed and an engine that is to say the least questionable. <br>  <br>  Try to donate it but don't expect much of a write off at all...not at all. If you try to sell her make it as is/best offer and take the 1st one that comes your way.

I7NkFJo2aa	Back in my model boating days we were just at the start of the use of 'weedeater' engines in rc boats.  They are just another engine.  Some can be mounted on a geared mount, I have seen a Stihl modified with a small pulley on it's shaft, and mounted on a frame with a large pulley and tensioner onto a braced drive shaft assembly.  It used a thin standard fan belt.  It was geared down significantly and worked very well.<br>  <br>  There is a link I can't find here somewhere - an American company makes a briggs powered shaft drive boat engine like the asian riverboat ones, it is very effective and cheap, it has a strange looking twisty prop that lets it drive over fallen trees and in only a couple of inches of water.<br>  <br>  In practice you will want at least 3 or 4 hp, and you will find the sound of that type of engine infuriating after not very long, so may others on a calm morning.... <br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  I found this one :- Long tails was the word I was thinking of....<br>  <a href="http://www.godevil.com/GO-DEVIL_Duck_Skiffs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godevil.com/GO-DEVIL_Duck_Ski...</a><br>  <br>  And this :- <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7052340/description.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/705234...</a>|`|OdxrtbF1aa	Lots of problems come to mind.  How about using a gas powered leaf blower and turn the discharge air into a jet drive?  You need to employ your creative genius to plumbing the air flow into the water.

You could try it, but the only concern I would have is that the weedwacker shaft and centrifugal clutch would not hold up to the torque created by the propeller once it was in the water.   I also think that the engine would bog down, because it could not turn the propeller fast enough in water to let the engine come up to speed.  Weedwackers are direct drive through a centrifugal clutch, which means the prop would not be turning at engine idle,  but once the engine began to pick up speed and the clutch engaged and locked,  the prop would be turning at the same RPM as the engine.   I think that they turn somewhere in the 10,000 rpm range..... way too fast for the propeller.   |`|e540c226567d45a2b9f2750a45a76d4baa	Well i never thought i would see this question in 1994 i was commerical fishing in FL on the Indian river their is a large restricted use area by the Cape (no engines allowed) so after a long day i was hauling my boat out and their it was a canoe with a weed wacker so cleaver and unseen and it worked those Southern Gents earned this Yanks respect that day.Michael PS I was their clamming not fishing|`|sxXoLSPxaa	several motors are available called "mudbugs". used by hunters in shallow water marshes. |`|EooU3QGnaa	I think it was called a "bumblebee"  Built in the far east some where- thiland comes to mind.|`|6vh05YP3aa	yes in fact homelite has one you can buy for around 268.00 |`|QUVDkWfvaa	its possible<br>

PDJ6mylTaa	Because it takes a lot of paint to keep her good looking.|`|RjUhISEIaa	from wisegeek.com:<br>  <br>  The exact reason why boats are called she in English is lost to history. While explanations abound, most appear to be of the folk variety, assumed or invented after the fact as a way to make sense of the phenomenon. Boats are a truly interesting case in English, as they are among the only inanimate objects that take a gendered pronoun, whereas most others are called it. Countries are also called she, as are cars sometimes, but the latter example is almost certainly an extension from boats.<br>  <br>  One plausible theory is that boats are called she because they are traditionally given female names, typically the name of an important woman in the life of the boat's owner, such as his mother. It has also been surmised that all ships were once dedicated to goddesses, and later to important mortal women when belief in goddesses waned. Interestingly, although male captains and sailors historically attributed the spirit of a benevolent female figure to their ships, actual women were considered very bad luck at sea.<br>  <br>  A second theory as to why boats are called she points to the existence of grammatical gender in most Indo-European languages besides English. While Modern English has hardly any grammatical gender, limited for the most part to cases of natural gender, such as the nouns "woman" and "man" being called she and he respectively, there is evidence that English once has a more extensive system of grammatical gender, similar to that in languages such as German and French. In most Indo-European languages with grammatical gender, the word for "ship" is feminine. In Old English texts, there is more evidence of grammatical gender, such as a shield being called she. <br>  <br>  Because English is an Indo-European language, it is most likely that it once had grammatical gender and lost it, since it would be highly unlikely for all the other Indo-European languages with grammatical gender to have acquired the feature independently rather than inheriting it from a common background. Linguistic historians have postulated that proto-Indo-European, the hypothetical "mother language" to all modern Indo-European languages, originally had two genders: animate and inanimate. The inanimate category later split into feminine and neuter, giving three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. As each language evolved, so did its system of grammatical gender, so that it has become different in each modern-day Indo-European language.<br>  <br>  Whether the fact that boats are called she is a throwback to an ancient system of grammatical gender that has disappeared from English in all but a few instances or an analogy to the reverence that sailors have for the women in their lives, the phenomena is one of the most interesting anomalies in Modern English. Recently, advocates of gender-neutral or non-sexist language have proposed that ships no longer be called she, but rather it, like any other inanimate object. <br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: someone sure didn't like answers given on this one with all the thumbs down! Bottom line to the answer is that nobody knows why vessels were named after ladies...|`|U24VtSlZaa	take care of her, and she'll take care of you.<br>  <br>  neglect her at your own peril.|`|csmEH6qsaa	All that I have ever read on the subject goes to the gender language answer.

Anyone who's capsized a dinghy or rounded up hard in exciting conditions knows what I mean, especially if you watched her sail away after recovering from a capsize.

Boats and women are expensive to maintain, glamorous when painted up nicely, sturdy and strong, but have weaknesses that we can deal with.  Boats and women can be wet down below and airy above, can be a handful if you don't pay attention, and a joy to ride on a nice summer evening.  They are both fun, but require plenty of work.

Good luck!|`|3CA6gZQraa	ethanol is bad for all marine engines because it is an alcohol and over time absorbs water while it sits in your gas can or tank that is why they make a special blend of fuel stabilizer for gas that contains a higher percentage of methanol or ethanol fuels|`|AA11657414	in addition to Patrick's answer, not all fuel lines are alcohol resistant and can turn gummy and fall apart on you, leading to a gas leak which is A Very Bad Thing, especially in the bilge.|`|Q904TpBzaa	yes don't use it...........it will burn your valves.|`|RjUhISEIaa	very interesting answer jtexas and thanks for posting it.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Pretty much any outboard made from the 70's on will do fine on 87 octane gasoline oxygenated with 10% ethanol (E10).<br>  <br>  The problems are associated with handling the fuel itself, not what it does to the motor.<br>  <br>  If your outboard was made before the mid-80's and still has original carb floats, fuel pump diaphrams, fuel lines, those might not be ethanol-resistant, but it's unlikely for a motor of that vintage to have not replaced those items anyway.<br>  <br>  If you have gunk in your gas tank, the ethanol will clean it out and use it to clog the carbs.  <br>  <br>  If your boat has built-in fiberglass tanks, ethanol will dissolve the resin and deliver it into your engine, where it will lead to piston failure.<br>  <br>  Modern polyethylene (plastic) gas tanks are immune to ethanol.<br>  <br>  Ethanol can hold substantially more water in suspension than gasoline can.  Water dissolved in the fuel is not a problem -- but if the temperature drops enough, "phase separation" can occur, in which the fuel separates into two layers:  a water and ethanol mixture under a layer of seriously octane-deficient gasoline.  In a pre-mix motor, the oil stays with the gas, so if your motor does happen to start on the ethanol-water layer, it won't be getting any lubrication.<br>  <br>  Phase separation is a bigger problem for marine engines than automotive because the typical boat sits around for weeks between uses, not to mention the opportunity for water to accumulate in the tank.<br>  <br>  Avoid buying marina gas whenever possible, and use a fuel stabilizer like Stabil or Seafoam.<br>  <br>  methanol is like ethanol only worse.

The difference between the min & max mark on most cars is only 1 litre!. If I was you I'd stop driving it, check the oil in the morning (when it's light) & have a look. If the oil is way above the max mark you will have put in way too much & probably blown the oil seals in the cylinder... As for getting rid of the oil, there is a plug at the bottom of the sump. Although you will then have to replace all the oil anyways...|`|5FR2afKeaa	simple just get a clean container open up the sump ring and empty oil. Close sump ring and pour back in the right amount of oil. Dont drive your car anymore until you do this, there is no such thing as flooding with oil but excessive oil can do alot of damage to the piston rods it could bend them if there was too much oil in the sump when doing there up/down cycle. hope you havent done too much damage better again none goodluck..|`|ZsEuZA3gaa	Hi Jesica, <br>  this is something i did once when i started my apprentiship with a MB garage. if you can, find the dipstick. it will give you an indication of how much to much you put in. 1 was the old oil removed before adding 5L? 2 was the engine able to turn after? 3 did you hear a sound simeler to an old smoker clearing his chest?<br>  <br>  1 if the old oil was still in you NeeD to find the sump plug, it is at the bottom of the engine. but you will want to have a wide flat contoiner ready to catch the oil (just incase you drop the plug) if you are good you can hold the plug in and release the oil in a controlled way, without it running down your arms making the whole experience nasty!!!! let some out and check the level on the dipstick. if you let out too much in a clean container just put it back.<br>  <br>  2 if the engine is still stuck after draining enough oil, remove your spark plugs put a rag over the engine. swing it a few times to remove any oil that may be caught in the sleeves. (the rag is to prevent everything around youre car from being oil coated)<br>  <br>  3 every engine has a brether pipe, allowing your engine to let out any air in the block back to the air filter. the noise is oil blocking that pipe. (like when your sineses are blocked) this will be fixed in part when the oil is at the right level. however you must open the air filter housing to see if the filter is blocked with oil.

OgdqAdr7aa	being rich is easy, how rich do you want to be?  What things motivate you in life.  What are you passionate about.  Find a way to harness that and make something no one has come out with, or better something that is already on the market.  These days anyone can make millions without a lottery ticket.  Invest in the financial market.  Everything is so hurting, stocks are cheep , houses, land.  Take out a loan and invest it all, the market will pick up again.. Buy Caterpillar stock, (construction equipment) while they are cheap, a friend of mine sold his and made half a million dollars.  |`|VhhEz92Oaa	I have to agree with Vodkastan on that one.  Liberals, like the one just elected, want to BE rich, but they HATE rich people and want to take away as much of their money as they can and give it to the people that don't or won't work for it.  It's called welfare and social programs.  The president elect calls it, "Spreading the wealth", but he won't give up HIS money.<br>  <br>  So, the more money you make, the more they will tax you, so that they can spend it on the lazy and useless.<br>  <br>  If you want to be rich, you need to work very hard and make wise investments or start a company.  Once you figure out a way to make a lot of money, get a good accountant and make sure you're not spreading too much of your wealth.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe the best welfare is JOBS.  But I'm afraid you'll be seeing far fewer of those.  Jobs are created by companies, right?  So if you start a company to get rich, you'll hire people to do some of the work.  The more work you get from customers, the more employees you'll need and the more money you'll make.  That's great for them and it's great for you, but it's also great for America's economy!  Exciting, eh?<br>  <br>  But, the liberals want YOUR money, and they'll take it in the form of very high taxes since your company is doing well.  Now you're screwed, and you'll have to lay off employees to save money.  Not good for them, not good for America.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that in the next 8 to12 years it will be much tougher to get rich than it has been in the past.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and that yacht you should buy so that you can talk to us about BOATS instead of money, (same thing really) your new government will impose huge 'luxury' taxes on it just because it's expensive and "you don't need it", even though you worked hard for the money to buy it.<br>  <br>  Sounds fair huh?|`|GY7n0nl8aa	Obama has said he'll punish you for being rich.

csmEH6qsaa	Boatin' in Va has a great answer.  <br>  <br>  For general use the danforth style anchor will work great, has super holding power for the size.  The 13 or 14 lb would be my choice too.  The little extra weight over a 9 lb gives a lot more security when the hook is needed in a heavy current or high wind.  <br>  <br>  3 to 4 foot of chain and enough anchor line to anchor properly ( 5 to 7 times the depth) with a 14lb danforth would work great.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|RjUhISEIaa	We carried a 13 for our 25' cuddy cabin and would definitely recommend it for a pontoon. Plenty of grip if needed.<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: as you can tell from the answers given there is a mixed feeling on what anchor one should use and what should be used where. Your pontoon boat will weigh in less than our 25' Chaparral did (4800 #'s) and we never had any issue in any type of bottom or in any type of weather conditions with the 13 Danforth. From dead calm river anchoring to conditions with 6 foot seas and 65 mph winds our anchor always held. I must add though that I did put 3' of chain on her to have her settle flat and grab and that should be sufficient for yours too. The ultimate decision though is yours to make but just don't go too small or you could be in a world of hurts.|`|41BwrWOIaa	There's actually quite a bit of science that goes into selecting an anchor for your rig. Here's an article to help you better make your decision:<br>  <br>  What To Look for in an Anchor<br>  As you will realize after reading this article, not all anchors are created equally. There are, however, common attributes that you should look for when making your choice.<br>  * Holds well in all types of bottom - weed, rock, sand, mud.<br>  * Can be set and re-set quickly and easily under all conditions.<br>  * Strong craftsmanship.<br>  * Good holding power.<br>  * Can be released easily and effortlessly from the bottom.<br>  * Can be stored easily on deck - compact.<br>  <br>  Styles of Anchors<br>  The following represents a list of the most common anchor designs currently on the market.<br>  <br>  River Anchor: This anchor is designed specifically for river currents and heavy drift conditions. The grappling action of the three individual blades provides secure holding power, while the flow-through holes provides easy pull up.<br>  <br>  Grapnel Anchor: Most grapnel anchors are made with four arms that easy fold up, providing a compact and easily stored apparatus. This style of anchor is ideal for small boats, and is ideal for dinghies as there are no open flukes to puncture the sensitive fabric of the craft itself.<br>  <br>  Mushroom Anchor: The mushroom anchor offers a wide area cap that offers effective holding power in mud and weeds. The drain holes in the base allow for easy retrieval, allowing water and mud to quickly be displaced.<br>  <br>  Navy Anchor: This is the traditional style of anchor. The stock is made to fold flat against the shank for easy storage, making these ideal for smaller craft. Navy anchors work well in rocky bottoms, and will also penetrate easily through weeds.<br>  <br>  Fluke Anchor: The fluke anchor, or Danforth has two "flukes" or appendages that are used to hold on the bottom. The 'stock in head' design is what makes this anchor work, not the weight, and it provides extremely high penetration. Flukes work best in sand or loose gravel, literally burying themselves out of sight when lowered. One drawback is rocks or boulders - they can become wedged in so tight that the only option is cutting them free.<br>  <br>  What Size Do I Need?<br>  <br>  Deciding on a certain size of anchor can be a bit of a guessing game. Since conditions are always changing, there is no "right" size for the job at hand. One misconception people make when shopping for an anchor is the heavier the better. This is just not true. Physical size, rather than weight, is actually a better indicator of the anchors holding ability. (Some anchors that only weigh 5lbs. can hold in excess of 1,000lbs!)<br>  <br>  When it comes to choosing an anchor, bigger is always better. Bigger anchors have more strength to resist breaking, occupy more of a surface area to resist pullout and will have more weight to penetrate deeper. Go with the biggest anchor you can get by with for the size of your watercraft. The last thing you need when rough weather arrives is an inadequate anchor that doesn't do the job.<br>  <br>  Go to this web address to view the entire article:<br>  <a href="http://www.ontariofishing.net/news/june2005-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ontariofishing.net/news/june2...</a>|`|AA11432856	Well that would depend on where you use the boat. in areas were there is a lot of underwater obstructions trees, rocks,ETC. I would not use a Danforth,Northill,Hall or Grapnel style anchor as these would get hung up and you would loose them. In these areas I would look for a still water  (basically a big weight) anchor in the 20lb 30 lb . Otherwise a 20lb Danforth style would work fine. A general rule of thumb up to  30 feet is to use an anchor that is around 3/4 to 1 1/2 lbs per foot. Too light an anchor and it will not have the mass needed for the flukes to gain a good hold. You should use at least 10 feet of chain ,called an anchor rode attached directly between the anchor and the anchor rope|`|AA12136768	Few questions will get more answers in a boating forum than 'what anchor should I use'?  <br>  <br>  The sum of all the answers is:    It depends! <br>  on:<br>  bottom, wind, current, depth, boat size/weight and  It depends!

csmEH6qsaa	Sounds like you may need someone to show you about GPS and nautical charts.  <br>  GPS screens give lots of information - location in latitude and longitude, water depth , navigation ads, tidal information, some of the newer charts even have coast pilot information build in.    <br>  On a marine chart water  is shown in several colors,  with white as deeper water, blue is shallow.  There is sometimes shades of blue for varying depths.  You should also see the depth contours - depending on your detail.<br>  <br>  Here is a web site that has some useful information:<br>  <a href="http://boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/chart101.htm" rel="nofollow">http://boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/char...</a><br>  <a href="http://boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/charts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/char...</a><br>  <br>  You may want to take a course on GPS or Boat Navigation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - Boat Safe ! <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  cheap keyboard - make spelling mistakes all the time :)|`|RjUhISEIaa	pssst...Captain Bill..."with white as deeper water, blue is swallow?"<br>  <br>  99.99999% of us know what you mean but you had me LMAO with this answer!

There is a great deal more to learn about boating and seamanship than you can learn here in a few minutes. The course should cover the basics of GPS navigation and give you enough information to start learning how to do it safely. |`|AA10157295	Knowing that it is depth is good, but remember you must know whether the depth scale is in feet, meters or fathoms. Not knowing will likely be embarrasing at least if not more serious when it comes out that you never took a course in navigation and don't know how to read a chart and are running a boat. <br>  Best thing is to not use the gps which may be misleading until you are very familiar with its functions.  <br>  The only time there are 2 numbers associated with a depth is when the first number is the whole unit of depth and the second number is a fraction of the unit. You will usually only see this in shallow water where a fraction is pertinent because the unit of depth is large as in meters or fathoms. Meters come to mind where the first number is the number of meters and the second number is set one half below the baseline of the first number and is a fraction of the meter. There is no way to show that example in this format.<br>  <br>  <br>  Power Squadron offers navigation courses. USCG Aux also offers inexpensive safe boating courses.<br>  <br>  |`|nAzbLdBCaa	I have a Grumin GPS and they have a "guide" that gives you the symbols etc that are used on their computer charts.  These don't match perfectly with those on the NOAA charts.  For instance the locations on marinas and restaurants are completely different.  I've seen three different brands and or models of GPS and the operations and charts of each are different.  So, You should consult with the place you bought your GPS and get their user guides.  White and blue indicate the water depth. But it varies by location and chart.  For instance the blue is less than 20' and white is over 20'  but as you can understand.  You could be in 5' deep water in one spot and 18' in another, both in blue, Where in the channel, white, you might be in 40' water or even 90' deep water.   One thing they didn't tell you is that the locations of objects, like islands or docks, don't always match it's actual location.  Your GPS might place you in the middle of a building in stead of your actual location at a dock nearby.  Don't worry you'll learn, but GPS is very accurate. |`|zzVvWgbXaa	Please remain Ashore untill you take some time to learn the basics,<br>  there are enough Idiots relying on GPS out in charge of a boat.<br>  R.N.L.I. have to go out to rescue them
VhhEz92Oaa	I believe there is a short in the system.  Have you disassembled the connectors and cleaned each pin?  If not, try that, then ring out each wire to ground.  Only the green ones and the sky-blue pink wires should be grounded.  Except on Sundays, then the orange ones are grounded as well, if you are north of the equator.<br>  <br>  You might also want to flush the entire fuel system with Skippy brand fuel conditioner.  Use the smooth and not the crunchy for obvious reasons, unless it's a diesel.  You didn't mention if it is or not.<br>  <br>  Have you tightened or torqued all the gonculation valves?  The newer plastic ones usually don't last unless they were covered by the latest service bulletin from ABA.  I prefer the aluminum or brass ones myself.  A leaking G valve will cause the same trouble you're having.<br>  <br>  Did you use a whisk, a spoon or a fork to stir the batter?  That has a definite outcome on any boat problem.  I prefer a 316 or 301 stainless steel whisk with a lower diameter of at least 2.5 inches.  Aluminum leaves marks and NO ONE likes that.<br>  <br>  You might also think of trading in your computer for a box of candles and a cheap compass.

Ask them if they would like for you to pay to have the car repaired or possibly have your boys work it off by doing yard work, shoveling snow, etc. <br>  <br>  Now, if they want you to pay for it ask them to give you two quotes from "licensed" body shops in your area and then take the lower of the two.

Your homeowner's insurance (if you own) or renter's insurance (if you rent and have the insurance) may cover this type of damage, so check with them right off.    If not, then you should pay.  But definitely have them get a quote (or even two) from a reputable repair shop before you give them any money.  And then only pay what it states in the quote.  I'm sure you punished your kids, but also make them work around the house for you (mowing grass, doing dishes, laundry or whatever) to try to earn some money/allowance to help pay you back for the expense.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  Also -- I just remembered, on my car insurance, if it were MY car that was damaged, this type of damage would be covered with no deductible to me (like when a rock flies up and hits the windshield).  You might want to check with your neighbor to see if they have this kind of coverage before giving them any money .  If they do have this kind of coverage and would not be out any money of their own for the repair, then offer your kids' services for mowing their lawn, cleaning leaves, cleaning snow, whatever, rather than offering money.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	A silly question, of course, YOU pay!<br>  Have them get a Quote and you Pay for it.<br>  b-t-w, are you SURE your Son did it?

They have great layouts both on both the interior and exterior, quality power packages, excellent hulls and warranty packages as well. <br>  <br>  We owned at 2550SX cuddy that we sold for top price after 14 years of ownership (she looked and ran like new) and now are in a 33' Signature cruiser. Quite honestly there is no better cockpit or cabin layout than with this vessel. Exterior seating for approximately 15 and a cabin with a forward V berth and a stern cabin with almost a queen sized berth. Storage is found under all seats except two (3 topside that are huge and 5 below) plus a cedar closet and sufficient cabinet space to keep you underway for a week or two.

Four Winns and Sea Ray both make good boats, and I have friends who currently own one or the other and are very happy with them.  Sea Ray has a very active community of owners, with events like Aquapalooza which can be neat if you are looking for that kind of thing.  I would suggest looking at brochures on both, and deciding which features are really important to you.  Then go out and find dealers you are comfortable with, and get out on the water.  See which boat you are more comfortable in - which cockpit layout you like best etc.  A lot of people tend to shy away from going to a dealer, since we tend to think of it like a high pressure sales thing - but in my experience, the good dealers have sales reps who are really into the whole boating lifestyle, and are knowledgeable about their boats.|`|A825Lmfjaa	I guess it would depend on what you'd be using it for.

How in the world are you going to have a place in the rear of a boat trailer to mount a hitch?  No it cannot be mounted near the transom of a boat since sterndrives and outboards will obstruct its use or damage the lower unit/outboard.<br>  <br>  #2.  Even if this is legal some states you pass through, others could prohibit this entirely or restrict towing more than one trailer to trailers certified to handle this.<br>  <br>  You could also end up with a ticket even if this is not prohibited in a state if it does not meet a police officer's trailer safety criteria.<br>  <br>  #3.  I doubt you are qualified or capable to tow more than one trailer, because most with significant towing experience will tell you this is VERY bad idea.<br>  <br>  In short, towing two boats on trailers in tandem is not practically feasible and could violate state laws in the various states you might pass through.|`|AA11432856	Assuming he has no Commercial drivers license and you didn't say if he was in an RV  <br>  <br>   But if he only has his boat and pickup I  suggest he take the jet ski to a boat dealer or a launch the has a hoist and pay,  to have them lift the jet ski, trailer and all,  into the back of his  pickup truck with the tongue facing rearwards.  now he is only towing one trailer  problem solved. he can reverse this when he gets to his destination.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Best check with state laws as piggy back might have issues>and to control it would be quite a job><br>  |`|jlajkhcBaa	if you have lights and brakes on both trailers, and your truck will do it, yes<br>  <br>  however, dont back up|`|VhhEz92Oaa	TJ, you can do it.

That just DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.<br>  <br>  But.. don't take my word for it... you should just contact the office of Naval Intelligency and tell them you want the drawings to a nuclear submarine... they will probably even deliver them to you FOR FREE... but you may have to answer a few questions first.
RjUhISEIaa	Sorry to hear this Lonnie.<br>  <br>  What area of the country was the boat stolen from? If you can give us some more information on color, etc it'll be much easier for us to watch for her.<br>  <br>  Please post more info so assistance can possibly be given.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|A825Lmfjaa	OUCH!! I'm sorry to hear that, that's so sh-tty that some people can just do stuff like that!  I hope you find it!  Not to be funny, but it wasn't repossessed was it?  I hope for the best for you.
AA10255553	There are usually 3 departments: Deck, engine and stewards dept.<br>  Deck is the sailors and navigation, engine is the mechaincal propulsion side, stewards cook the food and clean the rooms.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Any vessel of any size? This is a very broad question for it would range from the smallest to the largest on the water.<br>  <br>  More information on exactly what you are seeking would make answering this a whole lot easier for those of us who might want to give it a shot.<br>  <br>  Thanks.
AA11599219	Funny names and sexually oriented names do not go over well with the FCC when hailing on the VHF and can cause problems when entering some foreign ports.<br>  <br>  <br>  My point being, what is funny and what is the best are probably not the same thing.<br>  <br>  |`|RjUhISEIaa	David's answer is right on the $$$ as to the FCC's take on names and should be listened to.<br>  <br>  Now...we've got one in the marina next to ours whose name is "Job Site." He's not lying to the boss when called on the phone and says he's on the "job site."<br>  <br>  There's another in our area too that's "On Appointment." Again, no lying when asked, right?<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: Wow...didn't realize this was a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" question! Someone sure had fun with the thumbs down.|`|ly5ZcXzMaa	aquaholic.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	The best name I ever saw was my buddy's fishing boat:<br>  <br>  Happy Hooker.<br>  <br>  I was fishing with him one day and a lady called over, "Love the name of your boat."

xHoq5Ga8aa	depends on what kind of car it is.<br>  <br>  I used to have an Audi which had the battery under the rear passenger seat. No kidding.|`|RjUhISEIaa	I know I don't have it.<br>  <br>  Anyone else?|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	some vehicles have the battery in the trunk like the cobalt and some batteries are buried under the washer bottle on these newer cars, it would help to know what kind of car you have.|`|U7Immhtkaa	WHAT KIND OF CAR? If it's a Chrysler product (on some models) It's located in the front right fender. You have to take the wheel off and the fender liner (big job) and you should be able to see it. Not that you can reach it! It's the biggest joke I've seen. Anything else I would have to know what kind of car it is.|`|AA12261615	what kind of car are you working on,that would help us to know that much about it,we can only give information based on what you tell us about the vehicle,good luck.|`|zhHoHRRmaa	What battery are you replacing? It usually is located on the back!|`|jPlXgYnEaa	what kind of car do you have?  Depending on the make, model and year it's either in the front on the right or it's in the trunk with the spare tire. <br>  <br>  Your owner's manual would tell you the exact location.  <br>  <br>  That is depending on if you are looking to replace a car battery....|`|77e6c94fab8905f50f23a8a7e5cf5f40aa	A Year make and model would help us greatly with telling you where it may be. if it's not under the hood or in the trunk, the next option would be under the rear seat. 
RWjvcCYoaa	That depends what type of loan you have, an auto loan or a personal loan. If it's a personal loan, the payoff will be the remaining balance plus repo, towing and storage fees. <br>  <br>  If it's an auto loan, it depends if it's a Rule 78 loan or not. A Rule 78 loan loads most of the interest onto the first few years of payments so that it works, in effect, just like a personal loan ... even with an early payoff you'll still the entire balance off. <br>  <br>  If it's not a Rule 78, which most auto loans are today, you'll pay the principal, interest and late fees on the payment you're behind, plus the principal only on the remaining balance. There'll be no interest charges on that part of the loan.<br>  <br>  Either way, you'll still have to include the repo, towing and storage charges to the auto loan balance to get a final payoff figure. Call the lender for that amount.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Normally you have the principal amount plus any interest owed on the date you are paying it off.<br>  <br>  However, you may now also have to consider paying the cost of the repo. This could include the towing charge and any storage fees.<br>  <br>  Check with the bank and 1) see if you have to pay any of the repo charges and 2) ask how much is owed by the end of the day after you speak with them.<br>  <br>  That's all there is to it...|`|ojg83vyUaa	You have a per diem that will tack on to your loan each day.  This amount can be from .25  to 3.00 or so depending on your rate and other factors.  If you pay off your loan you need to get a 10-day close out.<br>  <br>  This takes into account the per diem for the next 10 days because the processing is not immediate when you place your check in the mail.<br>  <br>  When you pay it off early, you will not be charged for the remaining interest that you WOULD have been charged for had you kept the loan for the whole legnth.  <br>  <br>  **Note:  Some banks charge you a fee if you pay it off within the first three months of the loan<br>  <br>  <br>  Use the phone and you can usually get an automated 10-day payoff for your account through your lending institution.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers everything for you!|`|iNkOiNC7aa	I have no idea where you are but you need to look at your contract...some finance companies will penalize you or require the entire financed amount paid whether early or not...it should be stated in there somewhere good luck, home loans are like this here to, i'm in the u.s. in case you aren't..If it's repoed, it is delinquent in payments and you have to pay entire amount financed. sorry|`|Gm35YXFEaa	The interest is pro-rated. You will have to call your finance company to get a pay off amount. There is no way to figure it out on your own.
