AXiKJDV9aa	I would put your odds at UCSD at about 50-50.  Rice - low odds - it is one tough school.  Michigan a reasonable shot - maybe about 60-70% chance.<br>  <br>  Have you thought about Harvey Mudd?<br>  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmc.edu/</a><br>  <br>  It is a terrific math/science/engineering school and sends a lot of students to graduate school - that's where the action really is these days.  In fact I can not think of a single engineering school better in that area.  I would put your odds at getting in as better than Rice at about 50-50. <br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|Zg4s4wRzaa	From what I've seen, you have a good chance of getting in. My friends got into UCSD with 3.8 GPAs and around 2150 on their SATs. A 32+ on your ACT is great. <br>  <br>  You also have wonderful extra curricular activities. Make sure you do well on your AP tests and make sure you write an impressive college app essay that will make you stand out from the other few hundred thousand people just like you.|`|0b7hq71Faa	you have a pretty good chance of getting into UCSD<br>  my brother got in and you seem to have better grades and stuff

xvxtQwV5aa	alternative as in what, juvy-like or like homeschool? A little more information would help.<br>  If juvy-like, it separates the students from the distractions and freedoms of public schools. It allows them to focus more on their work and provides less of an opportunity to horse around and do anything but what's in the syllabus
8YYwdccpaa	I agree with the other answers.<br>  List 64 for CC, 47 at university for a total of 111 completed units.<br>  Unless any of them are graduate credits that would count toward the grad degree, they are not transferable units.<br>  <br>  List your degree just as you think: what the degree is and 5/09 as your graduation date. <br>  <br>  If you have other questions, talk to one of your professors or advisors because they've been through this many times. I'm sure that you are asking for a recommendation letter from at least one of them, and that person would probably be happy to help you with your application questions. Good luck!|`|OJKE7Lewaa	The transferable credits is for the graduate program, not the credits you transfer in your undergrad. Some graduate programs have a list of courses you have to take to graduate, so if the list includes classes that you have already taken, then call the graduate school and see if you can have those courses transferred. <br>  <br>  For the degree earned and date of degree, go ahead and enter BA of .... and your expected graduation date.|`|20axdeO2aa	I am only assuming: List what it asks. In this case 64 units at your CC and 47 at your 4yr school. By transferable units, I am guessing it asks for units transferable to their program (the program to which you are applying). Good luck! =)

inZ9CWBiaa	The reality is that it is incredibly difficult to fire a teacher. There has to have been a lot of stuff happening that you don't know about. She will have had verbal and written warnings.

Sorry.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	there was probably...something else more serious|`|nG9nxMySaa	maybe something happened that you don't know about? there may be another reason she was fired. a lot goes on "behind the scenes" at school that students don't necessarily know about (e.g. issues between faculty members). she could have also quit.<br>  <br>  if you are sure she was fired and you really care about this, consider writing a letter to the principal and encourage other students to do the same. a letter with strong points has more power than a petition. it is very unlikely that the teacher will be rehired on the request of students (because the principal probably feels there is a legitimate reason that she was fired, plus it would be insanely awkward for him) but you can still make your voice heard.|`|xhubRrQlaa	This is a personnel matter and the principal can not comment on it. If the teacher was fired, it would be in the school board minutes as Jane D. personnel matter closed session. Maybe your favorite teacher resigned. If the principal was on her case and she was a good teacher, it could have been a personality conflict, or she could have found a position closer to home. The truth is that you will never know why the teacher left and you will have to learn to like a new teacher. Please remember that this teacher is thinking of you (her students) and whatever happened, regrets the way you are feeling right now.|`|VEScnfoHaa	I always fear that my favorite teacher is going to be fired, because he is absolutely and completely awesome! (Although it may not look that way in the principal's eyes). Some things that he does:<br>  <br>  1. Wrestles with the students to the point where he is sitting on them<br>  <br>  2. Arm wrestles with the students and have arm wrestling tourneys<br>  <br>  3. Is very easy going<br>  <br>  4. Let's kids run around and go behind his desk and sit in his chair<br>  <br>  5. Also allows you to go in his closet and mess around with stuff<br>  <br>  6. Plays jedi with other students using wrapping paper rolls as weapons<br>  <br>  7. Pretty much lets you do whatever you want<br>  <br>  8. One year, he let students build a fort out of the desks and everything<br>  <br>  9. Another year, a group of students were playing silent ball and it got so out of hand that a boy's elbow went through a window and he already had a cast on it<br>  <br>  10. On wednesday, he brought his club down to the fitness center and they played dodgeball in the wrestling room. Some of the kids got so aggressive and out of hand that another boy broke his arm.<br>  <br>  11. Despite all of the injuries, HIS CLASS IS FREAKIN' AWESOME!<br>  <br>  I'm just afraid that one day, our principal is going to come in the room and see him sitting on another student lol. Then, he would definitely get fired.<br>  <br>  If you are going to sign a petition for your favorite teacher to get rehired, I would suggest looking into your school's policy and seeing if that is okay or not.

Even if you get all A's from now on I don't like your chances - it will be a big reach.  Remember schools like that reject perfect students with straight A'a all the time.  If you are not in that class, you are behind the 8 ball from the start.<br>  <br>  Students that get into Ivies are generally in at least the top 10% - even if they go to really though schools.<br>  <br>  The type of students that get into Cornell do what you suggest AND are in the top 10%.  They have far too many applicants in that group to worry about students outside it.  However an MIT admissions officer (its quite possibly the hardest school in the world to get into) mentioned the 10% rule.  They reserve 10% of places for students that do not have the killer grades etc you normally need to get in.  You may be lucky and be in that 10% - but I wouldn't count on it.

M7ve2QZCaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Life is never any easier but it gets lighter when you learn to love it--- all of it. It's the same in college. The first and second year may seem easy since major subjects are not yet killing you--- with lots of Maths and Sciences--- it could be easy when you love numbers and thrills,but if you don't, even your early years in college will still suck. The third and fourth year would be more challenging since more and more major subjects are getting there, but then again, it's still up to you. I've just finished my thesis and it's all about your query. I've learned that you need to be motivated even more especially when you're in tough notes or situations like college. For me, college is tougher than high school when you take it seriously--- it's the preparation for your career. On the other hand, it becomes so- so if you won't feel the very essence of it. So, I'd say that make sure that you're interested about what your taking up so that you'd be more persistent and motivated in completing college. Goodluck!|`|VPpZ2TbQaa	I agree that sometimes college seems easier than high school. There are a lot of reasons for this. 1. You were really smart in high school, it carries over. 2. Your college of choice lacks educational rank (it's just an easy school) 3. Your class choices are not difficult enough<br>  <br>   Not every college is the same. Every college is different, holding it's students to different standards.

Read the headlines, "Professor X is a child of incest."<br>  Your professor is a fool and/or you're so naive.<br>  Confessions are for the Catholic Church.<br>  Don't be surprised if you're the only one who has a black sheep in the family tree.|`|AA11485682	I agree with your father. Vow of confidentiality or not, revealing that sort of personal information outside of a medical setting where it is necessary can be considered a breach of privacy. Saying "Well, they promised not to tell!" doesn't erase the fact that you're telling strangers family secrets.<br>  <br>  At the end, it's your call, but perhaps you should ask the rest of the family if they're okay with this.|`|30XHbV35aa	I think your father is right, and there is potential for both students and the professor to get in to serious trouble. There would be a chance, maybe a small chance, of ending up with a professional misconduct disciplinary judgment. That may not matter to the professor greatly, but would effectively kill your chances of obtaining a job as a social worker in many countries. This is why faculties working with people as research subjects have ethical approval procedures.<br>  <br>  Is this a compulsory exercise? I can see the value of the work, but it strikes me as very dubious that you have to present the results to the rest of the class and not just the professor, who would at least be covered by professional conduct requirements. Has this piece of coursework been approved by your faculty ethics committee? It would be your professor's responsibility to determine whether approval is needed, and to ensure that proper approvals have been obtained. Research studies covering sensitive personal information of identifiable individuals needs ethical approval, even if it is "just" a student research project. If it has approval, does the approval extend to disclosure to the other students or just to the professor? If the approval extends to disclosure to the other students, are arrangements in place for the discussion to be in closed session? Many universities have a policy that any student can attend any class. Also, what conditions were imposed in terms of informed consent? I would like to think that a university social work faculty would be very aware of the ethical, and possibly legal, issues surrounding something of this kind.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	I have to agree with your father. You need to ask before you put personal information like that out there. Just because you and your class took a vow of confidentiality doesn't mean anything. nobody's word is good these days and that's too much information. If I were you, I would either ask to use the info, or lie. It's just a school project, it's not like the prof. is going to go back and verify that every thing is true. And if he does question it, just tell him that your sources said no, that none of those things applied to them.

2jJTKeIHaa	For a freshman, you are doing pretty good so far. You do need to bring your GPA up, but getting A's in the honors classes should do that. Your SAT scores are also very important; you should aim for scoring in the 96th percentile which is about a 2100 and above. On top of this, involvement in school and community activities is vital. As if this wasn't enough, you need to be high in your class rank, about the top 5%.<br>  <br>  Essentially, you need to show that you are an all-around good student and person - good grades, involved, charitable, talented, even athletic. Nothing can guarantee an admission to Yale, but you can increase your chances.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	wow - I think you are doing way too much. <br>  <br>  maybe drop a subject or two.

FyAOpYlBaa	pisa2006??<br>  well, im just going to dive to your question. i don't know about the others, but comparing USA and East Asia (more specifically Korea) definately USA. There's more opportunity and less pressure.<br>  <br>  well east-asia, i'm a korean immigrant, and the main reason why my parents moved here with me and my siblings is due to rigorous education/competition in Korea. Alot of people send their children here so they don't have to suffer in korea. <br>  I'm not sure how it is in China, Taiwan, Japan, but i'm almost pretty sure that their education is also tough. <br>  When i was doing Geometry in the ninth grade my cousin in the same grade had finished that 2 years before, in 7th -_-.<br>   <br>  Colleges don't care about the extracurricular activities and community service. It's about the grades(unless you want to be a professional soccer player or something of course). It's more laid back upto Junior High i think, and then high school is harder esp if you're a senior. <br>  So my mom tells me that students (at least the college-bound ones) go to school in the morning, go to hakwon*(tutoring/another school) or study at the library and come home late everyday. My cousins who live there had to go through hours of tutoring, and tutoring in korea is not for students who don't understand or grasp the concept of a subject. It's like school part 2 after part 1 everyday.<br>  <br>  School teachers aren't like the ones in US, some are mean; (ex: i was only in the first grade when my teacher pulled on my ear. i was a first grader, and i dont recall doing anything to hurt another child or do anything seriously prohibited. I cried. can u imagine a teacher doing that here lol) <br>  <br>  The college entry exam like the SAT or ACT there is really hard, and even the really smart students have a hard time, like one of my cousins. He's studying another whole year to retake the yearly exam to get into his desired university (there goes a full year of your life).<br>  In Korean society, school reputation is important, so much that it might affect your marriage depending on the in-laws. I'm not saying that in the US school rep isnt important, but it's pretty bad in korea.  <br>  In my opinion, there's something wrong with education there -_-<br>  I'm really glad to have moved here. I'd probably not gone to college in korea and wouldve died from the pressure. <br>  oh, but what i've noticed is that the life after college involves more freedom and less stress than in america.<br>  so i guess it's like work now, play later type of thing.<br>  <br>  WHOA it's so long. sorry for that ^^;;|`|yrwq0gNcaa	I live in the USA!

5EGm6ZLhaa	Forget criminal justice and certainly do not even consider sociology for law school-- you will be wasting your time as neither of these will prepare you for this life.<br>  <br>  Both philosophy and political science are good, solid majors. I am probably a little bias towards the former since that was my 2nd major. The idea is to decide on a major that interests you first and foremost, but that will also develop your research, critical thinking and writing skills and ultimately teach you how to think-- and any liberal arts or science major will prepare you for law school. So subjects such as psychology, history, philosophy, English, mathematics, economics, engineering, physics, etc are excellent choices.|`|0NkrNStxaa	political science and criminal justice/sociology|`|aMJfx44Daa	Either would be fine, and both are closely related to law.

xrKWtmYmaa	Did you mean x^3?  Or perhaps you meant to write x^2, in which case you can complete the square by adding 16:<br>  x^2 + 8 x + 16 -16  -10 = 0<br>  Note that when you complete the square you essentially add 0, because you add 16 and subtract 16.<br>  Now the first three terms are a square, so you have:<br>  (x+4)^2 -26 = 0<br>  or (x+4)^2 = 26<br>  Take the square root of both sides:<br>  x+4 = plus or minus sq rt (26)<br>  and x = -4 plus or minus sq rt (26)

aW7JLj0Caa	Juliet is portrayed as a sensible and fairly sensible character. She thinks through all her decisions and is not as impulsive as Romeo, therefore, her language not as unique<br>  <br>  Juliet doesn't really use any special kinds of language, compared to the other characters at least, but from our perspective, she's what a classic play should be. Tons of descriptions, soliloquy (long speech performed by a character alone on stage), monologue (long speech performed with other characters on stage.) <br>  <br>  Good examples would be Juliet's long lines before she drinks the potion, or parts of the balcony scene.<br>  <br>  Sparknotes really help with Shakespeare classics

Did another teacher who used the class put the cover on the clock and you have a later class?<br>  <br>  You can tell  your teacher that because  you are on crutches that  you have to leave the class 5 min. early to be able to get to your next class safely.  Tell the teacher that because you can't see the clock that you need him/her to tell you 5 minutes before the end of the period so you can get to the next class or to uncover the clock so  you will know when to leave.  Tell the teacher that you could be knocked down by the crowd or that your crutches could trip someone else who could be hurt.  <br>  <br>  By telling the teacher that, then he/she could be partly responsible for any injury if she/he does not let you go early or does not remove the cover from the clock.<br>  <br>  Don't fuss or argue.

GR2XNzCCaa	I believe that girls like Robert Pattinson because of how Twilight was so exposed, but also because he is playing the lead in a book about immortality, vampires, romance, and sexiness.

Overall, it is his character in Twilight and his overexposure from the media.<br>  <br>  Also, yes I am a Twilighter. lol I'm not a HUGE fan, but I have had one dream about Twilight (not Rob though specifically), but that is pretty much it aside from reading the books and seeing the movie.|`|N7vjmH6Uaa	hes just effing hot|`|0kTbs879aa	I dont believe you are writing an essay about Robert.

I love Robert, and no not just as Edward Cullen in Twilight but I think this is a needless question and now i see why so many people flip out over all these questions about Rob. Why dont you write about something that matters in the world rather than girls swooning over a celebrity? This obsession for Rob will eventually fade out (thats when we will see who truly loves rob and who is just obsessed w/ Edward) and its not like its some big unheard of thing... alot of Celebs ex Britney Spears are VERY famous and have alot of crazed fans. stop acting like this is some type of epidemic, ever since there were "celebrities" there have been crazed fans.|`|9MSeSH5yaa	I'm a twi-hard.

If you can get good grades and do it with involvement in other activities the school will recognize immediately that you have talent.<br>  <br>  One last item and do get all honked off at me.

AA11043457	First, talk to your parents about this teacher and see if they will go with you to the principal to discuss the problem with this teacher.<br>  <br>  The teacher pushing you into the locker was an assault and the teacher could have been in trouble.

Might not do your grade any good, but if there was retaliation, then that would be handled with the superintendent.   <br>  <br>  I'd hate to be in this class as well.  Some is hard to believe, as to the window thing at your house.  So if that is true, this teacher is a nut case and could be dangerous.  Talk to your parents right away.  Did you tell them when he did that to  your window?  And you saw him, not just the smiley face, right?<br>  <br>  Go soon to your parents and talk to them.

Sozc3MyFaa	There is some blurring over the exact definitions for these as "college" has some historical cache (Harvard College, Oxford College); but generally, universities confer a PhD degree; while colleges confer a bachelors & a masters as their highest degree.  Then again, some trade schools call themselves "university" and they give certificates.  There are also universities that are made up of "colleges"; in this case the college is a specific discipline (college of arts & letters, college of medicine etc). So there are some cross-over disticntions.|`|jBhFaZW8aa	Usually, colleges are smaller, and universities are larger.  (Referring to the U.S.)|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	In the US, 4-year colleges and universities offer the same degree - bachelors or art and/or science.  2-year colleges only offer associate degrees, and universities also offer masters and doctorate degrees.  If you're going to get a bachelors (4-year degree), you can go to a college or university.  Colleges tend to be smaller and private, universities tend to be larger and public (but not all are this way).

2AJmAD0Xaa	Your friends are giving you bad advice. Do not discuss these matters with people who do not appreciate your own personal right to do with your body what you consider to be right.|`|MINy26pjaa	I'm confused, you said "I don't have a boyfriend and my friends they think I am nuts because I got a boyfriend we've been together for 3 years and a half..."  How can you both have a boyfriend and not have a boyfriend at the same time?<br>  <br>  In any case, you should not become sexually active just because someone else thinks you should.  When you feel you are ready, and the time, place and man are right for YOU, it will happen.  That is a very personal decision and you should tell your friends that you are perfectly capable of making that decision for yourself, without their 'help'!

The money counts as added income and what your parents will pay in taxes depends on whatever the rest of their income and finances are.|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	How old are you? If you spend the money on education then your parents can use the $1000 as a write off. If you are old enough to claim yourself and are still in school you can claim exempt. either way if you do your taxes properly then you don't really have to worry about it. As long as the money is spent on Education and your parents Itemize then your good to go.|`|AlJrVK8Gaa	That is standard.  All its saying is that your parents must report the scholarship on their taxes.  The reason being is that your parents can write off any money they use to pay for your school.  A write off means that those funds are not taxed.  Although they can write off what ever they pay out of their pockets, they cannot write off scholarship money since it is not out of their pocket.<br>  <br>  good luck with the scholarship

AA11604732	You need a BS followed by four years in a Vet school to get your doctorate.  There are only 28 Vet schools in the US.

It is the single hardest graduate program to get into.<br>  <br>  Aee the link below for more details.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	You are looking at vet school, which is a professional doctorate degree.

Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend."<br>  “Time is what keeps things happening all at once.”<br>  “I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it.”<br>  “When a coin falls, it makes a sound. Not when it gets picked up.”<br>  “If you’re not living life on the edge, you’re taking up too much space.”<br>  “Friends have a way of always coming back to you.”<br>  “If you have to hold up both hands to know which way is right, then you’ll never be wrong.”<br>  “Courage is doing what you’re afraid to do. There is no courage unless you’re scared.”<br>  “You can’t hide listening – it shows.”<br>  “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.”<br>   “If you believe that you are defeated long enough, it will be likely to become a fact.”<br>  “When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and just hang on.”<br>  “Some people see a glass half full.

It’s just fairer than death. That’s all.”<br>  “On the other hand, you have different fingers.” <br>  “There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart’s desire.

Try registering for it and see if there is an option for a waiting list.  I would also suggest e-mailing the professor and see if you can get yourself into it.

e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	I would really suggest talking to a counselor at the school.  They will be able to give you the best information.<br>  <br>  Double-majoring and the length of time it takes is a little complicated.  It really depends on how many "credit hours" a major requires in the subject.  I am double-majoring, and it is going to take me 8 more semesters, essentially 4 more years unless I take summer classes, and I entered my freshman year with a semester down already.  <br>  <br>  You could potentially double major in Theatre and English and minor in Piano.  That is not unreasonable.  Usually, if the college offers a Major in something, they offer the minor in it as well.  <br>  <br>  To become a secondary teacher with those, look up what is required of you to become a teacher in your state.  I also intend on potentially becoming a teacher.  Because I am not going to get a "teaching degree," I plan on doing something called lateral entry.  Basically what is required of me is a degree in the field I want to teach, and at the very least a 2.5 GPA in the major (it is better to have a much higher GPA).<br>  <br>  I hoped this helped!  And like I said, seriously schedule an appointment with one of the counselors.  You will really be happy you did.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  edit: it does not have to take 8 years to complete a double-major.  Usually it may take 6.  <br>  <br>  Usually, the majority of your schooling will be "general ed" courses which will be the first 2 years of college.  (Englishes, social sciences, etc.)  Usually, the completion of just one degree takes 4 years.  So, doing some simple math, that means 2 years was devoted to your major studies.  Once you have completed those general ed courses, you don't have to retake them.  So if you want to do another major, that is 2 more years devoted to that major's studies - so 6 years in all.<br>  <br>  Although, you can cut down on that time by taking less "extra" classes.  You are usually allowed 10 to 12 "extra" classes when completing your major (like extracurricular in high school)|`|kFkV7Yroaa	good|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Okay I went to CMU's website and it's not the easiest to navagate.  It looks like they offer what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  You can double major or minor if you like...it appears they offer that...<br>  <br>  A good way to plan is call the school and ask to speak to an advisor or student services dept who can aid you in deciding what degrees are best for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ps.  It depends on your major programs.  I'm considering double majoring and it'd only take me an extra year 1/2 maybe two.  Your gen eds work for both majors you just need to make sure you take your preques in the right order.  It doesn't HAVE to take you 8 years if you plan correctly and if your majors don't have LOTS of credit hour requirements and obligations.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	I think, the "piano major" would just be under music.<br>  <br>  It takes around 8 years to complete a double major, and probably<br>  longer with a double minor as well. <br>  <br>  As for being a secondary education teacher, pick one, and then you can just take the tests after you get your degree to be certified in the others. <br>  At least thats how it is in Texas.

ORonhAuvaa	Personally I would not get annoyed if a student told me some of her issues. However, since I am not a counselor, there is only so much I can do. <br>  <br>  I would prefer that a student talk to me rather than acting depressed and expecting me to notice. I teach upwards of 165 students each day, so the chance of my noticing it while trying to take attendance, jam all the teaching I can into 50 minutes, collecting papers, answering questions and monitoring behavior is pretty darn low.<br>  <br>  I think that talking to a counselor would be great because they have strategies to give her to help her out. <br>  <br>  Teachers have just so much leeway and because we are extremely busy, it might be good for to offer to help out a teacher and then discuss some issues with her.

First of all, you need to sit down with some other students and make a list of all the things your principal does that bother you.  Next, you need to put those items into some kind of 5 minute speech.  You then need to get as many students as you can to attend a school board meeting.  One of you has to go up and read the speech to the school board.  In that speech you need to tell the board how disappointed you ALL are in the performance of your principal.  When you give your speech, have 8 or 10 students stand right behind you to show solidarity.  If you can't fill the auditorium (or place where the board meeting is held, don't go, because it will look like only a couple of students are complaining).  You need the whole school there! or a number close to that.  The teachers aren't going to be able to help you because they could be fired, so don't ask any of them for any help.  I wish you well in your endeavor.  This isn't going to be easy.  Good luck.|`|OMrSVM98aa	He's probably very grumpy, it could be because of maybe he don't like you students that much or teachers or whatever you guys say nice things and compliment about him and everything you seem might be nice that wont make him a electric eel!!!<----- Electric eel seems good enough for a very grumpy principal!|`|lNzUTpQOaa	Why don't you get all of the parents to sign a petition.  Then call the  school board directly, give them the petition, and explain the situation clearly.  But the key is to have a bunch of adults talk to the board (most people on school boards don't take kids seriously...ironic, but true).  If they say no, don't go down without a fight!!! Good luck, and I hope all works out for you : )

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	There is no minimum GPA requirements for getting into Purdue. You fall into the "normal" student GPA range at Purdue. Your activities will help your application.  <br>  <br>  I don't think getting into Purdue will be a problem if thats where you want to complete your undergraduate education (the occupational health program will help you get many of the courses you need to enroll in a PT program elsewhere).<br>  <br>  Strive for a higher college GPA once you are there.|`|jBhFaZW8aa	To be safe, try to bring your GPA up as much as possible, especially if the 3.2 is weighted. Colleges will unweight your GPA when considering you for admission, which is something high schools don't often tell students.  With a 3.2, you have a shaky chance at getting in - if it goes any lower, you will almost definitely be waitlisted.  Colleges do look at volunteer work and extracurriculars in admissions, so it's good that you have experience with those.  They will probably also look at the grades you've gotten in non-elective classes, especially classes that might relate to your major, from my experiences.  Additionally, they will look at the difficulty of the courses you've taken. If you've taken a lot of honors and AP classes, you're much more likely to get in.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	They do not have a pre PT program.

zCOvQwQhaa	1) most people take summer session courses (even "fun" courses) to either learn something or improve their employment prospects.<br>  <br>  2) if you're going to take a course, you might as well take it at the best college in the world - if they'll let you.<br>  <br>  3) it's a myth that there are "many good colleges in the area that are a fraction of the price"; per semester hour and continuing ed course fees at Harvard and Yale are actually lower than some state colleges and many privates.  The important consideration though is whether there are many good nationally ranked top 10 colleges nearby that are a fraction of the price.<br>  <br>  4) it is absolutely true that the admission requirements for a non degree seeking student or an extension student are much lower than the admissions requirements for degree seekers.  The classes are the same though so the performance standard is just as high.<br>  <br>  5) depending on your field of study or occupation, adding a line to your resume that reads "additional study Harvard University" can make a huge difference depending on where your degree is from.  Most important though - most people proclaim that the biggest benefit of attending these schools is the network that results.  That same network is gained whether you're a degree seeking student or a continuing education/extension student.|`|Cm7MQrhiaa	Although I am still in high school I would understand her choice despite my own personal opinion.

If this is the case she is using very poor judgement and wasting a lot of money. She could save a lot of money by switching to Geico and attending a local college (they have fun classes too). You should find out what class she is interested in taking and see if one of your local colleges offers the class. Then show her the information and the price difference.<br>  <br>  Now, maybe she just wants to take a fun class so she can test out the college and get a feel for the college environment, or the Yale/Harvard environment, without being tied down to an actual degree plan. This is the only reasonable conclusion I can come up with. <br>  <br>  Also, just because she says she is going to do it, doesn't mean she is. Harvard and Yale don't just take anybody who wants to attend or they would have half of America on their campus. I would just encourage her to do it. At least she's thinking about college, even if only for a fun class. Encourage anything having to do with college, this is the only way she will ever be financially secure. Support her. She probably won't be able to take a class at these schools and may decide on her own to look at the community colleges and see what they have to offer. <br>  <br>  As long as college is on her mind, support and encourage, support and encourage!|`|a66nvk0taa	Is she living in dream land?|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Can I ask you a question?

The Clinton administration pushed the industry to make loans to people that were not quite qualified so that more people could buy homes. The number of buyers went up, driving the prices of homes up. Home sales slowed because of the increased prices. Prices went back down.

0eQt44CLaa	A strong student-teacher rapport is essential for creating and sustaining a productive and positive classroom environment. If good communication is lacking between an educator and students, it can bring about the downfall of an entire learning system. On the other hand, if students and teacher maintain respect for each other, students will feel safer and more comfortable so that they can concentrate on learning content. Educators are not simply dispensers of information, but people with whom students need to feel trusting and confident.

It marks the beginning of recorded history. Whereas the rise of book publishing and journalism (see also newspaper and periodical) facilitated the widespread dissemination of information, the invention of the telegraph, the radio, the telephone, and television made possible instantaneous communication over long distances.

e0EMpoEqaa	Last I checked, IB courses are close to equivalent to AP courses.<br>  At my school, they are worth the same GPA wise and both end of the year exams count for college credit if you perform well enough.<br>  I recommend doing the IB Diploma, because obviously it will serve you better both nationally and internationally.<br>  The running start is ideal if you are dead-set on going in-state. Your chances at any of the bigger schools, say the Ivy Leagues, are slimmer. On a side note... I'm currently a senior and I have applied to Harvard, Yale, and Stanford... I have 30 credits with 9 AP courses.<br>  I recommend doing the IB Diploma.<br>  College credit from some sketch community college is not worth ruining your chances of getting to any better, out-of-state schools.<br>  Good luck with everything.

They tend to not trust others as they carefully watch them. Pale blue is the color of devotion and reflects one who prefers things to be in order. As blue becomes darker, it becomes moody and depressed, hence the term, 'the blues'. Lovers of royal blue can be on either a large high or in a deep pit of emotion. Navy blue is favored by those who are very emotional but wish to conceal it. They tend to indulge themselves in their emotions and can, in extreme cases, become obsessed. Being feelers, they cry when they are happy or sad and as a result leave themselves wide open to others. They can easily guage the mood of any person they are around regardless of their state of mind. Blue personalities can't explain the range of their emotions, as they are products of their environment. Looking for sympathy in others, blue people can be miserable to be with when they expect you to be down with them. Codependently, they need you to feel as they do. Too much blue around will create depression so it needs other colors to balance it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bharatmatrimony.com/astrology/color.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bharatmatrimony.com/astrology...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.search.com/search?q=colour+psychology+of+blue" rel="nofollow">http://www.search.com/search?q=colour+ps...</a>|`|dlXqtD99aa	I'll take a stab at this. I am not one-hundred percent sure but I believe it has something to do with the weather.<br>  <br>  When a storm moves in, which is generally darker weather (Dark blue-grey, black) the barometric pressure is lower. When the barometric pressure drops, people start to feel sad. I am not sure exactly what the cause of this is.<br>  <br>  This is why when it rains, people generally feel miserable.

You will be using what you learn in psychology to your advantage.<br>  <br>  English is also good but in college, you will have ample of opportunity to develop your writing especially if you study law.

Especially in a bad economy, employers look for the most qualified (often means educated) applicant.    I don't doubt that "this place sucks".  Maybe your school sucks too.  But for the long term, for money, security and most of all, for having some choice in life, stay in school and really try your hardest to get good grades.      If your friends are not doing well in school, try and hang out with those that are doing better.  Even if you have few options, try and make it easier for yourself to learn and study and get better grades - It will pay off eventually.  It's probably easier to finish high school than to try and get a GED later.    Spend some time thinking about what you enjoy doing and what you're good at.  (For what it's worth, you write better than many people who post here - maybe writing is one of your skills.)  Try and aim high, if you can start getting good grades it can help this become a reality.  Also, if you can work in an area that you have some talent for and enjoy, you'll be happier.    Try and find a counselor at school who you can relate to and talk over your worries and plans with.  If you don't like/can't trust/can't talk to that person, try and find another.  It can help.    Good luck!|`|TdqjsfEFaa	never drop school.its a big mistake of ur life.|`|0RFlpHXaaa	I don't know who u have been talking to, but when u go for that dream job, u will be very disappointed to find that people that have that diploma,   will have a far  better chance of being hired.

d8d012acc7e2b07077c8bf60a2d1f9c5aa	It's never too early to think about this!  I started thinking about pharmacy school in 8th grade, so I geared my classes in high school towards preparation for college.  Physics and calc are necessary, just as a preparation for undergrad (and you'd be surprised...some of the basic calc and physics has just come back to haunt me in one of my pharm school classes).  All pharmacy schools require calculus, and MOST require physics, so it never hurts to prepare.  If you plan on using AP credits for college, I would double check where you want to go to pharmacy school - a lot of the schools I looked at didn't accept AP credit for the major sciences, like calc, physics, chem, bio, etc.  And biology is DEFINITELY necessary!  In undergrad, you'll have to take at LEAST two semesters of it to get into pharmacy school, and some of the classes in pharmacy school require a basic knowledge.    I didn't take every single AP class and I got into undergrad just fine, and then into pharmacy school three years later.  It's really a matter of where you think you'd like to go to pharmacy school.  Some schools offer programs where, as a freshman, you are conditionally accepted into the pharmacy school, as long as you keep up your GPA, say above a 3.25.  That's where you'd probably want to make sure you get good grades in high school in those tough AP classes.  For other schools, their programs may be termed "2+4," meaning that it requires 2 years of undergrad before you get into pharmacy school, and you have to apply to get in.    Check out admissions requirements for both the undergraduate institutions you're interested in, and the pharmacy schools.  Also, your guidance counseler may be able to direct you.  But, if you have any questions or want an opinion on something, message me and I can try to answer anything I can.|`|z1RmCqBbaa	you can go to ur counselor for suggestions. i, honestly don't know. i'm sorry. the classes ur taking are really good.especially for a sophomore! physics and calculus is particularly good, depends if you also want to do science. i would cause i want to do physics in college.|`|Gd8NT8XMaa	Your going to need to take math courses and chemistry courses. I was a pharmacy tech with no training right after graduation. They trained me right away and then later if they decide to promote you, they will pay for you college training. I would say that biology isn't really necessary, but AP chem , physics and calculus are all very good courses to be taking. You should look into a pharmacy tech job as well, it will give you alot of experience with medications and will look good on your college applications.

If you are taking this time to figure out who you are, and what you want to do with your life, then just go with it.    But if you find something that you have passion for, take the time to study, even a little education can go a long way.    FYI, I worked all through High School, then worked after HS, eventually, I went back to school and it paid off.  however, because I have a crapload of experience, I get more job offers than most.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	In my experience, students who take time out either after school or after college are more mature and more focused - or find out within the first few weeks that further study is not for them.    Students who move along education like a conveyor belt system often go wrong - -  take the wrong subjects or expect college to be like school or uni to be like college. . . these are 3 very different places and it takes maturity and focus to understand that and to make each one work for you.|`|gmaCvh00aa	It will give you a head start in experiencing the real world, including the give and take amongst different types of personalities, and you may more quickly gain some insight as to what you want to pursue as a career.    Don't get me wrong, education is important (and learning should never cease, even if not formally), and certain professions require specific degrees (engineering, for example).  However, after 30 years of working in a corporate/public agency environment, it's become standard to see college grads enter the workforce thinking that because they have their degree, they are ready to manage a department.  Then they are insulted when they are asked to maintain the files.    They often have no real-life experience and are rudely shocked to find out that things don't always work the way they do in textbooks.|`|AA12367014	Work and school both have their benefits.     When you go straight to work:  You earn money (obviously)  You (should) learn not to goof around.   You can possibly be more independent.   However. You could have a harder time going back to school later if you choose to. You also won't get a very good job.       When you go to school:  You definitely become a more well rounded person.  You have the opportunity to meet many different kinds of people and to learn a lot about yourself.  You will go into a higher paying job when you are done.       I always vote for school first, but that is my preference.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	You get some experience and then maybe will appreciate college more. I went straight to college and don't have any regrets. I worked in high school and during the summers I was in college. I knew that I wanted to go to college. I didn't know what to study - balance what you love with what will pay the bills. It's not easy.    With the economy, if you are not sure what you want to do then go straight to work. Get some skills and experience. College is very expensive. I would definitely make sure you have your act together first. I would major in science or math or pharmacy or something where the pay is great and the jobs are plentiful. Accounting is a good area too.     Reality bites. I did business and would go back in time if I could and become a pharmacist or an accountant. I love pharmacy. I spent 5 years in the industry. It's busy and it's worthwhile work. It's interesting. I loved everything about it.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Depends on what job you get. My son's is struggling to finish college.

If your parents' policy does not provide for students than you can contact the admissions office of the school you are enrolled in and see if they have any student insurance you can purchase. If neither of these are an option for you, contact the department of human services in the county or state in which you live and inquire about public assistance (Medicaid).

lZa9R7IFaa	if you are good at maths and science, you should always take up Science in 11th, because science has many scope unlike other streams.

However, if you are average in maths and science, you can take Commerce.    MBA is done after graduation (any stream), hence what you do upto 12th isn't necessary, but if you take science in 11th, you have more options in case you decide against doing MBA.

He really seems to enjoy his work and he gets to do a lot of traveling (about once a month).

ISWrs9G2aa	In the US, the only people who can use the title "Psychologist" are people who have earned a doctorate degree in the subject (either a PhD or a PsyD).<br>  <br>  So the first thing to do is go to undergrad college and take the courses that graduate schools require (things like clinical psychology, social psychology, statistics, sensation and perception, etc).  Majoring in psychology will be the easiest way to do this, but it's not necessary as long as you take the courses.<br>  <br>  Getting good grades and a good GRE score are definitely important, as admission into graduate school is quite competitive.<br>  <br>  After you earn your bachelors degree, you can go straight into a PhD or PsyD program.  Some of these will give you a master's degree halfway through the program, others will skip it.  <br>  <br>  Note - a master's degree will qualify you for some psychology-related jobs such as non-clinical counseling (things like marriage counseling as opposed to treating major depression).  If that's what you want, you can go into a master's-only program and be able to practice after only 2 years of grad school.  You will not be able to call yourself  a psychologist however.<br>  <br>  During grad school you will specialize in a field of psychology.  The most likely one is clinical psychology, where you can treat patients for mental illnesses.  However, there are other less-known fields such as Industrial/Organizational psychology (where you help businesses achieve optimal results from their employees).  You can find a list here: <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/psychologycareer.html#someofthesubfields" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/topics/psychologycare...</a><br>  <br>  The first two years of grad school will be heavy on classes and reading; the second two will be more devoted to internships (in which you begin supervised counseling of actual patients) and your dissertation.<br>  <br>  After you earn your PhD or PsyD, you will need to check with your state to find out what further certifications and licensing you need.  Once you meet those requirements, you are legally able to set up a practice and call yourself a Psychologist.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	You need at least a Masters and preferably a PhD.  A typical road would be college 4 years - Masters Clinical Psychology - 2 years - PHd Clinical Psychology - 4 years - all up 10 years.  You may be able to get by skipping the Masters.<br>  <br>  You can open you own business or work as a psychologist for some kind of organization like a government department.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill

The duration of course may vary from one year to three years depending upon trade opted. After completion of ITI course a person has to undergo practical training in his trade in an industry for a year or two. This is necessary to appear for National Council of Vocational training (NCVT) certificate. This certificate is mandatory for applying jobs in relevant category in many companies. There are both government funded and private (self-financing) ITI's in India. Most of ITI's impart training in technical trades like electrician, fitter, plumber etc.<br>  After ITI people of engineering trade can go for higher studies like diploma in engineering.

lQIKWXDuaa	Yes you can go to Yale. They love accepting international students. Visit them at  www.yale.edu<br>  <br>  ss|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Sure you can.  Like anyone else you simply need to be drop dead good ie a straight A student in something like an IB program.  However I don't know why you would bother - the ANU in Canberra is rated as about the 16th best school in the world - not far of Yale at all.  And it would be a whole lot cheaper.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the ANU being better than Yale - I doubt it.  I attended the ANU for some post-grad so I suppose I may be biased.  Its just that the cost does not seem to be worth the hassle.  You may have friends in the US etc that would make Yale quite attractive, and if you get into Yale they will make sure you can afford it, so I suppose reasons do exist for going.  However for me they would need to be rather strong to spend the extra dosh doing a 4 year degree in the US when the ANU is so good. <br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|aCILl7ctaa	Yes, you would be able to go there.<br>  <br>  You would need outstanding GPA and such to get in because it's one of the best schools in the county.<br>  <br>  Check out their websites for information on international students.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|48SKEteeaa	Money will buy you anything you want including love and entry to Yale.

inZ9CWBiaa	I have a couple of ten year old's like that in my class! I have two words for you - natural consequences. Barbara Coloroso explains it far better than I ever could - check out her book Kids are worth it. The idea behind it is basically that in any circumstances that are not actually dangerous, the child needs to bear the weight of the consequences of their actions. If, for example, you tell him that he is responsible for packing his school lunch, he doesn't do it. You do not do it for him. You do not bring lunch to school for him. You do not give him money to buy lunch. You let him figure out what he can do about it. It won't be pleasant, but he will survive until he gets home and can have a sandwich. If he forgets his homework, he deals with the consequences (poor grade, being kept in etc). What I say to the boys in my class who try this is that I am not prepared to hear about any incident that doesn't start with what they did. I suspect that you have explained so much that he has stopped listening. Let some (non-lethal) chips fall where they may and see what happens.<br>  Remind him that when he points a finger at someone else, three fingers are pointing back at him.<br>  Persevere with this - you would rather he learn a few painful lessons now than some life-defining ones as a young adult|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	start holding him accountable.. tell him in this world what you do is no one elses fault. start punishing him for those things, and he will get it through his head you aint fallin for that blame game and he isnt going to get away with not taking the responsibility. punish him for it and tell him its the end of discussion.

2OXBPN5Raa	Well, Jane was in love with Tom Lefroy but due to financial problems they were not permitted to marry which could link to Jane and Bingley in Pride and Prejudice.  She was exceptionally close to her sister Cassandra linking with Jane and Lizzie's relationship.  She spent the majority of her life in Bath which features in all of her novels.  She died unmarried so that's obviously not a link but you could say that she was giving her characters the ending which she desired.  Actually Mary does not marry in Pride and Prejudice so could be Jane's way of showing that not everyone is that 'lucky'.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	To think about Pride and Prejudice in historical-terms, you have to realize that there was a "war of ideas" going on at this time, and boy was it bloody. It was taking place everywhere – in art, politics, society. On one side was the "Romantic movement," which was a response to the Enlightenment ideal of rationalism. The Romantics were all, "let’s talk about our feeeelings" and "let’s return to nature." The Romantics were reacting against the firmly entrenched conservatives who really liked rules, tradition, and the rigid conformity of the scientific method.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Pride and Prejudice

Km8hU4lgaa	Okay, I'll show you how to find two ordered pairs that should be pretty straightforward to figure out:<br>  <br>  First, the ordered pair.  They always look like (x, y) where the first number is the x-value, and the second is the y-value.  To find any ordered pair, you just need to plug in a value for one of the variables, and it will give you the value of the other one.<br>  <br>  For instance, let's start with x = 0:<br>  y = 1/2x + 5<br>  Fill in 0 for x<br>  y = 1/2*(0) + 5<br>  y = 0 + 5<br>  y = 5<br>  <br>  So, one correct answer as an ordered pair would be (0, 5)<br>  <br>  Similarly, let's see what happens when you use y = 0:<br>  <br>  y = 1/2x + 5<br>  0 = 1/2x + 5<br>  -5 = 1/2x<br>  -10 = x<br>  So a second ordered pair would be (-10, 0)<br>  <br>  Now you try.  Good luck!|`|WMXPzMQJaa	Well first off set the equation to 0 so:<br>  1/2x + 5 = 0<br>  Next subtract 5 from both sides of the equation so you get<br>  1/2x = -5<br>  Then multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1/2 in front of the x, you get<br>  x = -10<br>  Now that you have the x coordinate of the ordered pair substitute it in the equation to get the y coordinate<br>  y = 1/2 (-10) + 5 <br>  y = -5 + 5<br>  y = 0<br>  <br>  Now that we have both coordinates the ordered pair is (-10,0)|`|3MbgHvLWaa	The simplest way to find the ordered pairs is to you the slope-y-intercept formula and find two points that you can graph this line. This will also give you two ordered pairs instead of one.<br>  <br>  The slope-y-intercept formula is y = mx + b., where m = slope and b equals the y-intercept. In this equation, slope equals 1/2 and the y-intercept equals 5 {this means that the line crosses the y-axis at the point (0,5), which is one ordered pair. You can find a second ordered pair, by using the slope.<br>  <br>  You move up one point from 5 and move to the right 2 point and this gives you, your second ordered pair which is (2,6). <br>  <br>  This line goes through the two points or ordered pairs of (0,5), (2,6).<br>  You can prove this by plugging both of these ordered pairs and they will be equal in the equation.|`|CgJLftpRaa	When you have a problem like this, the easiest thing to do is make a chart. Like this: <br>  <br>  X 1/2X+5    Y <br>                         <br>  0 1/2(0)+5    5       Ordered Pair (0,5)<br>                         <br>  2 1/2(2)+5       6       Ordered Pair (2,6)<br>                         <br>  4 1/2(4)+5    7       Ordered Pair (4,7)<br>  <br>  The numbers under X represent X in your given equation. As you see, the equations under your original equations have the numbers for X in the parenthesis. When you solve the equations, you get the numbers that are under the Y. So you just plug in the number you wish to choose and your answers are your why. When you take your X & Y for each equation, you have your ordered pair. Understand? <br>  Since it's multiple choice, it'd be (4,7).

PHlZ5sYgaa	That's rough. It's hard to find a topic I agree with less, but this will ultimately help you build persuasive skills if you can write an essay about something you don't believe in.<br>  <br>  The best things to include in a persuasive essay are specific examples that back up your claim.<br>  <br>  You could say that selling condoms in stores encourages young people to have sex. It prevents physical consequences but does not prevent the moral/psychological consequences of having sex.<br>  <br>  You could also argue that because condoms are not 100% effective, they lull people int a false sense of security. Using condoms can lead to promiscuous or risky behavior. People might be less careful about when and with whom they have sex, and then could be exposing themselves to AIDS or unwanted pregnancy because condoms are not 100% effective.<br>  <br>  A third argument could be that many religions, including Christianity, which is the prevalent religion in the US, forbid contraceptive use. Condom use takes the procreative aspects of sex away, rendering it sinful/immoral.<br>  <br>  These are NOT my opinions, but they are things you could argue.<br>  <br>  You should google some anti-contraceptive groups and see what their arguments are. chances are they have some studies they've done, etc which you could cite.|`|c2o5fULpaa	Um... I guess they don't completely protect from STDs?<br>  <br>  They encourage prostitution?

Jr6emga0aa	A trophy wife is usually taken to be the second ( or later ) wife of someone who has succeeded in life and wishes to impress others with his trophy, who is usually younger, blonde, beautiful, materialistic, vacuous and reflective of attraction to the husband's success rather than anything deeper.<br>  <br>  Future TW means that you are thought to have the qualities mentioned above and aspire to such a superficial relationship. In some circles it might be taken as a compliment, in others that the negative adjectives above apply.|`|5huYfAofaa	Basically it means that you're looking for an old man to marry.

Perhaps they're like hearts : the smaller they are, like in birds, the faster they beat as compared to large elephant hearts.

Find the two numbers (x, y).<br>  <br>  This problem can be reduced to two equations:<br>  x + y = 18<br>  3x + 2y = 44<br>  <br>  The first equation (x + y = 18) can be used to find a working value for x:<br>  x + y =18<br>  x + y (- y) = 18 (- y)<br>  x = 18 - y<br>  <br>  This new equation (x = 18 - y) can be then plugged into the second (3x + 2y = 44), replacing the value for x:<br>  3x + 2y = 44<br>  3(18 - y) + 2y = 44<br>  <br>  Then, simplify and solve for y:<br>  54 - 3y + 2y = 44<br>  54 - y = 44<br>  54 - y (+ y) = 44 (+ y)<br>  54 = 44 + y<br>  54 (- 44) = 44 (- 44) + y<br>  10 = y<br>  <br>  Next, plug the value for y (10) into the original equation and solve for x:<br>  x + y = 18<br>  x + 10 = 18<br>  x + 10 (- 10) = 18 (- 10)<br>  x = 8<br>  <br>  Solution:<br>  x = 8<br>  y = 10<br>  <br>  Now, check your work:<br>  3x + 2y = 44<br>  3(8) + 2(10) = 44<br>  24 + 20 = 44<br>  <br>  CORRECT!|`|DfKdzD46aa	you have it set up wrong. first off there are 2 variables.<br>  the to equations are:<br>  x+y=18<br>  3x+2y=44<br>  <br>  then you have the choice to use substitution or elimination. i will use substition, where you solve for one of the variables<br>  x+y=18<br>  x=18-y<br>  <br>  now you put what x equals into the other equation<br>  x=18-y<br>  3x+2y=44<br>  <br>  3(18-y)+2y=44<br>  54-3y+2y=44<br>  -y=-10<br>  y=10<br>  <br>  then you put the value of y into the first equation and solve for x<br>  y=10<br>  x+y=18<br>  <br>  x+10=18<br>  x=8|`|plBT3GLTaa	it's 10 because 10+8 is 18<br>  & 3 times 8 is 24 <br>  10 times 2 is 20<br>  24+20 is 44.|`|c2o5fULpaa	The other number is 18-n or 10.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :]
PHlZ5sYgaa	Okay, the key to these is being very methodical. Let's start with the statement with the most imformation.<br>  <br>  Herb is 2 years older than the drummer and plays the sax. So the only ages that are 2 years older than another age are 22 and 10. This would make the drummer either 20 or 8. However, the first statement "the drummer is twice as old as...", means the drummer has to be 20, since 8 is not twice as old as anything..so:<br>  <br>  HERB 22 SAXOPHONE<br>            20 DRUMMER<br>  <br>  Back to the first statement. The drummer is twice as old as one of the woodwinds. Well we already have the sax, so the other woodwind is the Oboe, and the Oboe player is 10<br>  <br>  Next step: The Oboist is half Pedro's age.. the Oboist is 10 and ha;f the drummer's age, therefore the drummer is PEDRO<br>  <br>  HERB     22 SAXOPHONE<br>  PEDRO  20 DRUMMER<br>               10 OBOE<br>  <br>  Max is 2 years older than Enriqueeta. The only 2 year interval left is 10-8. Also, the youngest person is the drummer or the violinist. We have the drummer, so it's the violinist:<br>  <br>  HERB    22 SAXOPHONE<br>  PEDRO  20 DRUMMER<br>  MAX       10 OBOE<br>  Enriquette 8 VIOLIN<br>  <br>  All that's left is SHEILA 16 GUITAR<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|AA11735935	Herb sax 22<br>  Pedro drums 20<br>  Sheila guitar 16<br>  Max 10 oboe<br>  Enriqueta violin 8|`|GEfUTyi8aa	the drummer is either 20 or 16 yeard old<br>  The drummer or the violinist is 8 but we already  the drummer is 20 or 16... so the violinist has 8<br>  The oboist is half pedros age.... so he is either 8 or 10 (the only two numbers you can multiply by 2) but we know the violinist is 8 so the oboist has to be 10<br>  That means Pedro is 20<br>  The oboist is half pedros age so he is 10<br>  The oldest is a woodwind, therefore he is 22<br>  Sheila either plays the violin or the guitar<br>  Herb is either 10 or 22, the only two ages that can be two years older<br>  therefore the drummer is either 8 or 20 but we already know the violinist is 8 so the drummer has to be 20<br>  Max is 10 because that is the only age left that can be two years older<br>  therefore Enrigueta is 8<br>  Sheila plays a stringed instrument and there is only a guitar left and the age of 16<br>  <br>  So we know: <br>  Pedro is 20 and is the drummer<br>  the violinist is 8 so therefore enriqueta<br>  Max is the oboist who is 10 <br>  Herb is the saxophonist and he is 22<br>  Sheila plays guitar and is 16 because that is all that is left.<br>  <br>  You have to pay attention to what the information is telling you and eliminate as you go.

Moz2d806aa	It sounds like you already have the equivalent of a US bachelor's degree, so it will take you 3 years.|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	Since you already have an LL.B. you are eligible to apply to law schools, you may also find that some schools will give you partial credit towards a law degree through a specialized program allowing you to get a J.D. in two years as opposed to the usual three. If you had an LL.M. this program could cut you down to just needing 12 months to obtain your J.D.<br>  <br>  The cost will be expensive, most law schools in NYC and Boston will easily run you $35-$40K per year for tuition alone, excluding books, living expenses and other things such as health insurance and the Starbucks tab to keep alert during those all nighters. I would say as an out-of-state student in those cities, you are looking around $55K per year, so around $110K for the two years, and that is a very modest assessment. <br>  <br>  Finally you need to know that just because you have a J.D. does not mean that you can legally work in the United States.

One lasting effect was the spread of Eurpean languages across the globe, sometimes splitting groups into higher class and lower class according to language.

National lines were drawn without regard for the social groups living in the areas, thereby creating conflict for years to come.  Look at the modern day Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and Africa.

N7JPzxiRaa	Throughout the play, the themes of illusion and mendaciousness have been carefully developed. The entire royal Danish court is ensnared in a web of espionage, betrayal, and lies. Not a single man speaks his mind, nor addresses his purpose clearly. As Polonius puts it so perfectly: "And thus do we of wisdom and of reach^? By indirections find directions out" Act 2, Scene 2, Lines 71-3 The many falsehoods and deceptions uttered in Hamlet are expressed through eloquent, formal, poetic language (iambic pentameter), tantamount to an art form. If deceit is a painted, ornate subject then, its foil of truth is simple and unvarnished. Accordingly, when the pretenses of illusion are discarded in Act 2, Scene 2, the language is written in direct prose.

The answer to 2 is 2 cents.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :]|`|KFX3dTwZaa	1. divide 2.25 by 15<br>  2. you need to bring them to the same number so:<br>  <br>  or you times Toasty oats by two (to get the price for 30 and compare it with Crunchy oats)<br>  <br>  or you divide Crunchy oats by 2 (to get the price for 15 ounce and compare it with Toasty oats)<br>  <br>  hope it helps!!|`|d7bJIgqlaa	1.  To find out the price per ounce I think you would divide 2.25 into 15 and 3.9 into 30.  So, the Toasty Oats is 15 cents per ouce and the Crunchy Oaties are 13 cents per ounce.  <br>  <br>  2.  So, 15 cents minus 13 cents equals 2 cents.  The Toasty Oats are 2 cents more per ounce.<br>  <br>  Yay!!!|`|umgrxflFaa	1) 2.25 divided by 15 = 0.15p<br>  <br>  2) to do this you need to work out how much CO cost for 15, so:<br>  3.90 divided by 2 = 1.95<br>  then take the price of CO away from TO<br>  2.25 - 1.95 = 0.30p<br>  So the answer is 30p<br>  <br>  Hope this helped ^-^<br>  <br>  ~Emma<br>  x

3OoCiOkAaa	What you do dear is in stages<br>  <br>  <br>  Confess and be honest ( You say I am sorry)<br>  <br>  But you need to add why you are sorry.  As there are people who simply say sorry and don't mean it.<br>  <br>  <br>  But give at least four reasons why you are sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  1) For the disruption I caused the class- you interrupted other students class<br>  2) For aggravation to the teacher - they spend time preparing their class for pupils who need and want to learn<br>  <br>  3) Disobeying the school rules and the asst principle<br>  <br>  4) The aggravation you have caused your parents. They don't need to be rushing after you. You are more than capable of following rules.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You seem to have a problem following rules - so perhaps you can suggest to your asst principle that you will get some counselling in order to correct your antisocial behaviour.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you write this all in letters (by hand and give one to your asst principal , one to your teacher and one to your parents).  Also  just apologise to the students in the class - possibly at recess.<br>  <br>  <br>  Use some nice note paper or a card as it will look as you really mean it  and not just seeking attention.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember it is no point in saying sorry if you can't think of the reasons why you are sorry.  It sounds to others as if you are insincere and only saying what they want to hear without meaning it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you have a slight histrionic personality  and therefore without knowing it - you crave attention. You create the maximum amount of fuss to perform the simplest of task. Hence rules and regulations are a challenge to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  You need to also give up your phone if it has not been confiscated from you already for at least two weeks and tell the teachers and asst principle so.<br>  <br>  <br>  I once had a friend like you and I have known lots of people like you . You can be really fun and lively - nevertheless you can wear thin on one's patience because you are always seeking attention- even if you state you are not doing it on purpose. It can be tedious for onlookers .<br>  <br>  <br>  Please write those letters (by all means type them out on the computer first_ and then copy them by hand or write the message in a blank card.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is up to you to make amends and if you are sorry only you will know the reasons why.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are not writing the letters to  to try to fool and manipulate people. You are writing them because you mean it. Otherwise  it is pointless in apologising for something you couldn't care less about. <br>  <br>  <br>  Please read the histrionic link as that my explain what is happening to you at the moment. You might not have the full personality disorder, but some of the characteristics.<br>  <br>  It is not  a mental illness, but your personality. It is a superficial personality disorder as those who have it normally cannot see the world from other people's point of view and they may have difficulty taking orders and following rules.<br>  ????????????????????????????????<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|hokifT2Haa	do you want to know what i would do??<br>  i'd write your principal an apology letter....i know it sounds really gay and all but their the type of things that mean adults like!! lol XD<br>  sorry if this doesnt help but i've seen people doing it before and it worked!!<br>  good luck<br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	If you need to ask how to apologize and mean it, you probably don't understand what you have done wrong and won't be able to give a sincere apology.

Perhaps offer to write your principle a report explaining why your past behavior has been wrong, and how you intend to repair it.  Most decent people will forgive a sincerely reformed person.<br>  <br>  You must understand, that many people will be questioning your parents ability to parent you.

Tell him you are very sorry for what you've done.<br>  Ask him to keep your phone for you until the end of the school year. If you do this sincerely, everybody will believe in you again. Guaranteed.

KVkU6WSpaa	4. y = 7x - 2<br>  <br>  The y intercept (b in the formula y=mx+b) is the point at which the line intersects the y axis.  With the known value of x = 1/2, we would need to move x left by -1/2 to reach the y axis.  Since the slope is 7, that would make y change by 7 x -1/2, or -7/2.  Since the known y is 3/2, adding -7/2 will give you the y intercept point at -4/2, or -2. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|oT3d4Yu0aa	Y- 3/2 = 7(x-1/2)<br>  y- 3/2 = 7x- 7/2   add 3/2 to both sides<br>  y= 7x- 2<br>  answer is number 4
Yig05fKQaa	The numbers one and two have obvious significances. Three is often seen as a "magic number" to human existence. It is often seen as an ideal number to represent human thought processes. People tend to unconsciously divide things into groups of three or three groups. For example, there is always a "beginning, middle and end." When people think about social interaction more complex than two people they generally think of things as three parties (ever hear someone say "third party"?). The number system is based on 9 whole number digits, which is three sets of three. While the 10 integral digit number system is for the most part based on having 10 fingers, the unconscious comprehension of three sets of three is important to make this number system work as well as it does with humans. Numbers in a logarithmic (base 10) sense (as in adding 0's to the end of a number) are divided up by sets of three (ie. 100,000,000). The metric system works the same way. These are all arbitrary and independent of nature--they were set the way they are because humans tend to be very comfortable with dealing with up to three of something. Obviously, one can visualize more than three things just fine, but three is really the ideal number to use for visualizations.<br>  <br>  If someone is telling you, however, that numbers 4-7 are more special than 8-9, for example, they are (at least regarding the point I am about to mention) deluded. I have heard of people acting like seven is a special limit for human comprehension, but this is not based at all on science (as the number 3 is), it is merely a popular misconception. 1-3 has astronomical significance, but not 1-7. I would hypothesize that people feel 1-7 is special because of their unconscious recognition that 7 is the highest prime number that is less than 10.

i8HxOaRUaa	I hope this helps you! Good luck with your report!<br>  <br>  Polar bears are perfectly adapted to survive in the harsh conditions of the Arctic, where winter temperatures can plunge to -45? C (-50? F). Two layers of fur provide the bears with such good insulation that they experience almost no heat loss. In addition, they are protected with a layer of blubber that can measure 11.5 cm (4.5 inches) thick. Compact ears and a small tail also prevent heat loss.<br>  <br>  Polar bears are so well protected from the cold that they have more problems with overheating than they do from the cold. Even in very cold weather, they quickly overheat when they try to run<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the Canadian Arctic, adult female polar bears with cubs hunt about 19% of their time during the spring and about 38% of their time during the summer. Adult male polar bears hunt about 25% of their time during the spring and about 40% of their time during the summer.<br>   <br>      <br>  3. When not hunting, polar bears are often sleeping or resting. From July to December in Canada's James Bay region, when lack of ice prevents seal hunting, a polar bear may spend up to 87% of its time resting. <br>  ? On warm days polar bears sprawl out on the ground or ice, sometimes on their backs with their feet in the air. They may also make temporary snow or earthen pits to lie in.<br>   <br>  ? On cold days polar bears curl up and often cover their muzzle area. During the winter, some polar bears excavate temporary dens or find natural shelters to stay warm. They may use these shelters for several months at a time.

f06Sy0dfaa	I don't know what this A 2 B 2 is, but as for your question:<br>  They are multiplication. I don't think your can "combine" all of the terms, I would have said evaluate.... Here are my answers:<br>  3X(7X+8Y) Multiply 3X x 7X = 21X^2 (squared).<br>  Then 3X x 8Y multiplies to give you 24XY.<br>  So 21X^2 + 24 XY is the answer.<br>  <br>  Bi     Tri<br>  (X-2)(X+2X+4)<br>  Since it's a binomial times a trinomial, you will get 6 answers (to start off with until you combine like terms).<br>  Distribute the x to the trinomial and the negative 2 to the trinomial, and then combine like terms.<br>  So :<br>  X^2 + 2X^2  + 4X -2X -4X -8<br>  Then add all like terms. For example: <br>  The highest exponents are alike, then the x terms, and then<br>  the constants.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hoped I helped you some.... I explained it the best I could over the internet.
ZbTeOwuTaa	You can never (and should never) stop caring about what other people think about you completely.  You just want to make sure you care about what you think about yourself more.  You can do this by making sure that you like the person you are and the things that you do.<br>  <br>  First, start by meditating for 10 minutes every morning or night.  Let yourself relax and repeat silently in your mind a word that inspires you.  This will help you relax and lower your stress levels.  It's easy to take out anxiety on yourself, so eliminating as much as you can from your life in a useful skill.<br>  <br>  Next, be proactive in shaping who you are.  Think of the person you want to be and become them.  I'm not saying pretend to be someone you're not, I'm saying let yourself realize your own potential by fine-tuning the instrument that is you.  Maybe you wish you didn't gossip so much, or that you were more physically active.  Make an effort to fulfill those private dreams no matter how small or insignificant they might seem and you'll find dozens of little reasons to be proud of who you are and how you got that way.<br>  <br>  Lastly, stop judging other people.  Everyone does it, but it's actually pretty counter-productive.  When you find yourself inwardly scoffing at someone, you might not realize it, but you're judging yourself by the same if not far more harsh standards.  If you start learning accepting and loving all people for who they are, you'll also start learning to love yourself the same way.  Not to mention, other people will like you more too.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's a slow process, but if I could do it, you can too.  The first step is wanting to make it happen.  Good luck!|`|AA11735935	This is a tough one.  Try to look at how your actions might affect others, but don't always look at whether or not they like or value what you do.  Ultimately, you have responsibility for what you do.  Someone out there (even if it's only one person) is going to say mean things.  You cannot control that.  Just don't take the comments at face value.<br>  <br>  I'm not asking you to be totally cold or cynical (which might be easier).  Just take comments with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  I work on this one most every day myself.|`|AA11988503	Thnk about WHY you want their acceptance. Is it because you want something they have? Do you want their friendship? If you figure out why you care, maybe you can start doing things to get past that.<br>  <br>  Surround yourself with people who encourage you and don't judge you. Or get out there and do things on your own, such a write or take pictures or start running. If nobody is around to judge you, then you can start being happy simply by how you feel.|`|Q56v2Kt9aa	First of all love yourself the way you are.  Stand tall and hold your head up high.

AA10295239	Congrats! The Provost Scholarship is the second best scholarship that UB offers.  The next one up is the Presidential Scholarship and that is a full ride.  So to answer your first question I would say that receiving the Provost Scholarship is an accomplishment that you should be proud of.<br>  <br>  To answer your second question, I doubt that Fredonia is delaying any scholarship offers.  But by no means should you take my word for it.  I would call the admissions office and ask.  I've found that admissions people are very friendly and very willing to help.  <br>  <br>  Most of the time scholarship notices are mailed with admission offers.  Also, if you look at the scholarships offered by Fredonia, there's not a lot of them. Only 2 people receive the Fredonia Distinguished Scholar award ($5,000) and only 12 receive the President's Award of Excellence ($3,000).  Statistically speaking, you have better odds of getting into any ivy league college.  UB, on the other hand, does not have limits, if you qualify then they give you the scholarship.  But not all hope is lost ;] Fredonia does say that,  <br>  <br>  "Scholarship recipients will be notified on a rolling basis beginning February 15, 2009 with a response date of May 1, 2009. Scholarship review continues until all awards are offered and accepted."<br>  <br>  This means that should one of those 14 people decline their scholarship, then you might be next in line to receive a scholarship of equal or greater value than the one UB has offered you.  Again I'd call admissions or financial aid at (716) 673-3253 to get the answer.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'd just like to say that you shouldn't pick between those two solely based on the scholarships they offer you.  You should visit both Universities and any others that accept you.  See if you like the environment and the people.  If you feel both schools are equally good then that is when you should take cost into consideration.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations again, you should feel very proud of your accomplishments!|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes it is

Also, perhaps check out the PBS series 1940s House which took place over in England during our modern times and put a family of today under the restrictions and food rationing of WWII in England.|`|AA11735935	Okay, what happens in a society when many of the men go away?  Who steps into those positions?  And how does that affect those positions?  And how does that affect the family structure of the times?<br>  <br>  Same thing happened in WWII, I think.  Look up Rosie the Riveter.  You might be able to backtrack from there.<br>  <br>  Also, look into the women's suffrage movement.  Women did not gain the vote in national elections until 1920, after WWI.  That may be an issue in itself.
InSi6vUTaa	You have to search beyond what you see. <br>  <br>  A hidden significance, greater than is first apparent.<br>  <br>  You see, when you look at a person, some people may just see their outer looks. But when you REALLY look, like, REALLY notice things about them, you can find out so much more. For example, a girl. when you look at her, you probably might just see a nice face and a good body. But when you REALLY look at her, notice the little things she is doing, or the way she says things, there can be so much more. Like maybe a nice personality, a smart vocabulary, she can be the most amazing girl you ever met, but SOME people wouldn't know, because they don't notice EVERYTHING, just the outer things. <br>  <br>  Basically, Looks can be deceiving. <br>  <br>  What you see, may not always be what you get.|`|a745fd4991e56bc329c2046486a5dde2aa	The quote is "there's more to a person than what meets the eye".

There is more to a person than his/her appearance.|`|kAqjxDHaaa	It means when you meet someone, you're only seeing a small piece of who they really are. Once you get to know them, there isn't much more than "meets than meets the eye" to them.  <br>   Peter Parker is a perfect example. If you passed a nerdy little guy on the street, you don't immediately think " Hey look, Spider Man!" There's more there than you know.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

I can't find anything about WHY that is. Look up marriage in Elizabethan England and maybe you can find more.

Even if there was a verb that did not have a present participle form, you could still add 'ing' to it. In English, we also add 'ing' to a verb to form a gerund.<br>  <br>  For example, suppose the verb "to eat" had no present participle form and you couldn't say, "Jeff is eating". You could still add 'ing' to it. For example, "Eating makes me happy".<br>  <br>  Note that in this case, "eating" is not the present participle form of "to eat". It's a gerund -- a way to use a verb like a noun.

8t24Xmm9aa	Let me write your thesis for you.<br>  <br>  There are many definitions of what a "drug" is.  Commonly, the term "drug" is used to refer to either pharmaceuticals (SSRIs, antibiotics, contraception pills) or powerful human-altering agents of two categories: so-called "hard drugs," such as heroin, nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, and PCP (which generally give the user a quick and intensely pleasant experience followed by physical harm and/or addiction); and "soft-drugs" such as LSD, marijuana and DMT which generally have psychedelic properties and are not addictive/physically harmful.  Drugs, as they are practically defined as human-altering substances, can (and in our society do) have a profound impact on the individual and society.  Though there is a negative connotation to the word "drug," drugs are responsible for much of human innovation in health, philosophy, art, and other areas of study.  Though it is debatable whether this is good or bad, it is clear that drugs have changed the course of human history.|`|TfcQc0fmaa	How can drugs affect your life and your society|`|x9XyHskmaa	How about something that says:<br>  <br>  "Mass use of drugs and circulation of money has caused illegal drugs to be very widely and negatively viewed."|`|y2IUB2yXaa	Hi<br>  I just came across with these people and they really are providing good homework help in any subjects.

If you do 100/46, you will get about 2.1739130, so we can say that each question was worth about 2 points. Then, multiply the number of questions you got wrong by the amount of point each question was worth, you'll get 24. Now you subtract those number of points that will be taken off from 100. You'll get 76.

You will get 3 gallons, 5 quarts and 13 pints.<br>  <br>  You must also remember how many quarts are in a gallon, and how many pints are in a quart. If you remember, you will know that 4 quarts = 1 gallon, and 2 pints = 1 quart.<br>  <br>  Starting with the pints, if you divide 13 by 2, you will have 6 groups of 2 pints, with one pint left over. 6 groups with 2 pints each is the same as 6 quarts. (because 2 pints = 1 quart)<br>  <br>  Now you have 3 gallons, 11 quarts and 1 pint.<br>  <br>  Because 4 quarts = 1 gallon, you have to divide 11 by 4. You will get 2 groups with 4 quarts each (same as 2 gallons), and have 3 quarts left over.<br>  <br>  So the answer will be 5 gallons, 3 quarts, and 1 pint.<br>  <br>  Its a little wordy, but I hope it helped.

NOT A LABEL!|`|kItRaRmlaa	WHAT???????????????????<br>  <br>  ur indi and an iNDIVIDUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZxoU6Qvgaa	its become a label like everything else.|`|lASDuMWqaa	Very long answer - sorry!<br>  <br>  'Indie kids' or 'Emo's' or whatever you want to label the group as are the latest incarnation of countless youth subcultures over the years, dating back to the teddy boys and incorporating mods and rockers, hippies, skinheads, new romantics, goths, grungers and various other sub-sects.<br>  <br>  The irony is that in being individual you are in fact still conforming to a set of rules, albeit a 'non-conforming' set of rules. But there's nothing wrong with that - young people are supposed to dress up and be a part of a tribe. God forbid you'll spend enough of your life in a business suit!<br>  <br>  And the difference between 'chavs' and 'emo's' is mainly that 'Chavs' are working class who are into hip hop and dance, while Emo's/ Indie kids are more likely to be middle class and into rock. Plus you are more likely to be bottled by a chav, and sneered at by an indie kid for liking the wrong band. <br>  <br>  And the term 'Indie' in itself comes from record labels - bands like The Fall and The Smiths were 'Indie' bands because they were on small independent record labels. But most 'indie' bands of the last 15 years were all signed to major labels so it's pretty meaningless (notable exceptions - Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand, signed to Domino).<br>  <br>  Best summed up in Quadrophenia when Jimmy says "I don't wanna be like anyone else, that's why i'm a mod, see?"
ilz08Y3taa	There could be many differences:<br>  <br>  First, it could be that one is an adjective and one is a verb.  In this case "limpia" would be the adjective and "limpie" the verb.<br>  <br>  Ex.<br>  <br>  La mesa está limpia.<br>  The table is clean.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it could be that they are both commands and one (limpia) is in the "tú" form and the other (limpie) is in the "usted" form.<br>  <br>  Ex.<br>  <br>  Limpia (tú) la mesa.<br>  Clean the table.<br>  <br>  Limpie (usted) la mesa.<br>  Clean the table.<br>  <br>  The third and last possibility is they could both be verbs conjugated in the present, but one (limpie) is in the subjunctive.<br>  <br>  Mi hermano limpia la mesa.<br>  My brother cleans the table.<br>  <br>  Quiero que mi hermano limpie la mesa.<br>  I want my brother to clean the table.<br>  <br>  (It may also be possible that "limpie" should be spelled with an accent [limpié] and in this case it would be in the preterite.)<br>  <br>  Ex.<br>  <br>  Limpié la mesa.<br>  I cleaned the table.|`|DuKczuMjaa	i'm pretty sure that limpia is the adjective form and that limpie is the conjucated verb<br>  <br>  <br>  but idk, u could always call someone in ur class, or go to an online translator :]

j4PYvM7kaa	Otto, having the foresight to leave Germany, moved his family to Amsterdam, Holland in the summer of 1933|`|3MbgHvLWaa	The Franks or Frankish people (Latin: Franci or gens Francorum) were West Germanic tribes first identified in the 3rd century as an ethnic group living north and east of the Lower Rhine. Under the Merovingian dynasty, they founded one of the Germanic monarchies which replaced the Western Roman Empire from the 5th century. The Frankish state consolidated its hold over large parts of western Europe by the end of the eighth century and the Carolingian Empire and its successor states were Frankish. The Salian political elite were one of the most active forces in spreading Christianity over western Europe. The francisca is named after the Franks, because they used this weapon in battle.<br>  <br>  Contemporary definitions of the ethnicity of the Franks vary by period and point of view. It is often unclear whether people referred to the Franks as the Franks referred to themselves as such. Within Francia, the Franks were initially a distinct group with their own culture.<br>  <br>  From the third to fifth centuries some Franks raided Roman territory while other Franks joined the Roman troops in Gaul. Only the Salians formed a kingdom on Roman-held soil that was acknowledged by the Romans after 357. In the climate of the collapse of imperial authority in the West, the Frankish tribes were united under the Merovingians and conquered all of Gaul save Septimania in the 6th century.<br>  <br>  Also, these Franks would move to Amsterdam when there was a war going on. They would move there and then begin attacking to the south.

The plot of the story, I've found, doesn't matter so much as long as you illustrate your point (in this case, that you didn't cave in to peer pressure).<br>  <br>  In case you're unfamiliar, the "show don't tell" aspect of writing is the harder part of the requirements. Perhaps an example will help?<br>  <br>  TELLING: "I didn't cave in to peer pressure because I walked away from my friends and didn't listen to them anymore."<br>  <br>  SHOWING: "I heard what my friends were telling me. I knew it was wrong, but the offer still sounded tempting. However, after much contemplation, my conscience ruled out. I told my friends that what they wanted was wrong, that I didn't want to participate in it, and I walked away to do something else." In this case, you are SHOWING how you avoided peer pressure.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JVVsgMObaa	These sound like good topics. Just elaborate, the teacher wont know the real truth.

They then realize that they have no idea where Keerah is.<br>  <br>  Scene 7: Keerah tries to escape Codison's house by eating his acne cream, which she believes is magic. She becomes sick, and Codison brings her to the hospital<br>  <br>  Scene 8: Margret and Pedro run around for no reason. It is revealed that they are drunk. They are hit by a car, and brought to the hospital<br>  <br>  Scene 9: In a surprising twist, we see that Margret, Pedro, and Keerah are all in the same hospital!<br>  <br>  Scene 10: It is revealed that Codison is actually Keerah's father, in a flashback by Margret while in her coma<br>  <br>  Scene 11: The janitor trips over the life line that is keeping Margret alive.
