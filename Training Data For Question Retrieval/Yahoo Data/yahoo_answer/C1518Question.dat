20070626124729AArcpso	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Friendship question...Need your help here....?	Okay, my buds were in a band, right? But they broke up because of artistic differences. What it really comes down to is that there was too much ego garbage going on within the ranks so the band broke up....there were three of them and two of my buds didn't like the ego tripping of the head of the band...   The thing of it is...my two buds are forming a new band, but they're mad at me because I'm still remaining friends with the leader...we're all on myspace and they're all still on my page. To be fair, I'm actually closer to the two guys that left than the leader...and basically they're giving me the cold shoulder because I still have him on my page. I say that, just because they're having differences doesn't mean we can still be friends...I'm choosing to stay out of their garbage...Am I right or wrong here?

20070705014528AAviRRk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the truth? did Moses see a false God and was led astray?	what is the truth? did Moses see a false God and was led astray?   what say all the holy people in Q&A. even those that profess worthiness.      when i REad the book of revelation, i see a verse that condemns people for calling themselves worthy. I also see another verse that describes righteousness and filthy rags.    I know I am not worthy, even for the visions i have seen, yet I was full of faith and sincerity. Are there any people on this planet that are NOT deceived, are there any people that are worthy? I once said that no one is innocent, i also said i dont believe there are a thousand people on this planet that are saved, holy and righteous.    how can you prove i am incorrect and by what means do you proclaim it. ?

20070709125403AAerOt9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For those who believe in an afterlife: status quo or dangerous idea?	For me, dangerous idea wins hands down.       Here are some paraphrases from afterlife believers:      "I don't have to take care of the earth and my neighbors as if god wasn't here, because he IS here, and he will take care of it!"      "My children and their children etc.only matter while I am alive, because when I die, I don't have to worry about it anymore"      "I don't have believe deep down inside the validity/reality of an afterlife, because there are other options 1) Cave to herd animal mentality and just go with the flow 2) Use it to my or my master's advantage, helping to create fear in others so my master (or myself, if I am a master) can enslave them (i.e. work hard for me in this life and I promise the next one will be better!)"      I guess if you don't think its a dangerous idea to be in a state of enslavement, then you have to go with the cowardly answer 'status quo', no?

Te fiz perfeito para que aproveitasses tua capacidade,   e n?o para que te destruísses com teus enganos mundanos.      Te dei o poder de PENSAR.   Te dei o poder de AMAR.   Te dei o poder de IMAGINAR.   Te dei o poder de CRIAR.   Te dei o poder de PLANEJAR.   Te dei o poder de REZAR.      E te situei o poder dos anjos quando te dei o poder da escolha.

My hubby and I want to get married but he's had some serious money problems in the past that he's still trying to clean up. If we get married, I will loose my tax return (or it will be significantly less if we file separate) and my credit will be ruined (forget about owning a home for a long, long time). He has become very responsible with his money since then but I'd basically be screwed over if we are "legally" married. My parents are very supportive of a "marriage before God" only but I've been hearing from many people that they do not believe this is a good idea because people take advantage of it simple to cohabitate. My pastor will not even do our marriage ceremony. What are your opinions on this? I am a born again Christian and want to do the right thing.

20090225081849AACXgRq	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm in love with my best friend. How do I cope?	Sam is brilliant and very funny, looks just like Jarvis Cocker and dances like him as well, and wants to learn all the accents in the UK to travel the country, blending in seamlessly with the local population to secretly paint their portraits. I love Sam. We're like Vince Noir and Howard Moon :D      The problem is, Sam's a girl. I didn't think I was bi or gay or whatever, but I suppose I loved her ever since I met her, a year ago. I've had a few 'best friends' in the past, like the actual BEST friends who you trust completely, but I never loved them as much as I love Sam. She's beautiful and everything she does is amazing. I want to write her love letters and buy her dinner, and just have her all to myself, all the time.      I'm a pretty confident person, and one night (okay, also when we were a little drunk), I asked her if it was okay to kiss her, because she was an incredible person. She's really shy though, and she just ran away and hid (literally). I think she admires me as much as I like her, but she says she's straight and just wants to be friends.       So, she KNOWS how I feel about her, but since life isn't like movies, she's not suddenly going to go gay because I love her and we'll be happy ever after. I have a great time being her friend, but loving her makes me so unhappy, and I guess I take it out on her. And everybody else.      Since we'll never be how I want us to be, should I just break up with her? Kind of? Like a friend-breakup? That way I might be able to stop loving her. How else can I cope with this?

20090225082606AAERsIT	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Do you believe in Ghosts? Have a Story or pictures?	Hi! I'm looking for great ghost stories for my own entertainment :) If you have one please share. I believe my Grandmas house is haunted. I'm too scared to go into the "back part of the house" by myself. For as long as I can remember her house has been scary. My Grandma blames my mom for fooling around with Ouija board and doin other things she shouldn't have been doin when she was a teenager. When I take pictures at her house I get TONS of "Orbs" in the photos, and they are even "cut off" if they half way behind a wall. Things get moved in her house, and I'm deathly afraid of furbys now because when I kept mine in the bathroom over there someone went in to pee and the furby woke up on its own and started sayin "Yum Yum" and if you've ever owned a furby you KNOW that shouldn't have happened. But most I just get a "creepy I"m being watched" feeling. I wish I had a more interesting story than that, but sadly I don't :( My husband fixes peoples Air Conditioners and he came home one day to tell me that while he was in someones house he saw an old lady in what looked like "old fashion funeral clothes" and when she looked at him he said "Sorry I didn't know anyone was up here" he continued down stairs and outside where the home owners were and he asked them who the old lady was and they said "No on lives here but us" Ok that's my stories what's yours?
20090225082446AA6WHRK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, do you agree with your religious teachings?	Do you actually agree with what your religion teaches?   And remember, I'm simply quoting the bible. If you have a problem with it, moan to your god, not me!      Leviticus   20:9   If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death.      20:10    If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbour—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.      20:13     If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death.   Deuteronomy       22:20-1    If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house.      Exodus    35:2   For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.       Ezekiel   20:25-26   I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by; I let them become defiled through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.      Ephesians   5:22-24    Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.      Exodus    21:20-21   If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property.
20090225082716AAKYfAX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Bible "scholars", can you help me with this verse, please read : ?	In reading the commentary for Proverbs 4:20-27, it says " We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt."     What do you think God means by saying "keep our hearts from being hurt", do you think He means this so that we will have a more healthy heart to love others ?  What do you think God means by "keeping our hearts from being hurt" in daily life.  Thanks :)

The indigenous people of Africa aren't all Black and that the majority of the Australasia's indigenous population is Black.

As in, your Talmud says Yoma 39a-39b:      "Our Rabbis taught: During the last forty years before the destruction of the Temple the lot [‘For the Lord’] did not come up in the right hand; nor did the crimson-coloured strap become white; nor did the westernmost light shine; and the doors of the Hekal would open by themselves, until R. Johanan b. Zakkai rebuked them, saying: Hekal, Hekal, why wilt thou be the alarmer thyself?5 I know about thee that thou wilt be destroyed, for Zechariah ben Ido has already prophesied concerning thee:6 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.7"         And the talmud says that before 40 years ago, the straps would turn colors and stuff because the Lord would come up. Well, what happened 40 years before the destruction of the temple, Jesus was crucified as a sacrifice for all mankind. Therefore, the LORD need not come up anymore to the priests.       So isn't this proof?

LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. – The mayor of a small Southern California city says he will resign after being criticized for sharing an e-mail picture depicting the White House lawn planted with watermelons under the title "No Easter egg hunt this year."      Los Alamitos Mayor Dean Grose issued a statement Thursday saying he is sorry and will step down as mayor at Monday's City Council meeting.      Grose came under fire for sending the picture to what he called "a small group of friends." One of the recipients, a local businesswoman and city volunteer, publicly scolded the mayor for his actions.      Grose says he accepts that the e-mail was in poor taste and has affected his ability to lead the city. Grose said he didn't mean to offend anyone and claimed he was unaware of the racial stereotype linking black people with eating watermelons.      Located in Orange County, Los Alamitos is a 2 1/4-square-mile city of around 12,000 people
20090227121003AAyRqWX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What should i do about my very religious neighbor?	Hello all,      I have a neighbor who is Christian and is very clear about it. I myself am agnostic and every time she sees me come or go she takes it upon herself to preach the bible to me she has even gone as far as to buy my family a bible. She thinks that my family and I need to be attending church (her church) every Sunday she will say things like “I didn’t see you at church today”. Now I understand her position in trying to save me and I respect her religion. I have spoken to her more than one time and asked her to please do not push her religion on me. She gets very mean and bossy when it comes to her religion. I have told her look we are who we are and you are who you are we respect your beliefs and that is your choice but it is not for us. She than screamed at me that “Jesus did not have a choice when he died on the cross for my sins” she makes me feel that it is MY fault that those things happened thousands of years ago. I have tried ignoring her and even one time when I was not feeling well she said that I need to ask god to remove the devil from my body and I just snapped at her and said “no what I need is to see a Dr. and get some antibiotics!” I than slammed the door in her face. I have tried and tried what more can I do the more I tell her no the more she tries to make my life difficult. She is my neighbor and I want to find some sort of agreement. What should I do I do not want war. She has also even gone as far to say she will call CPS on me for not bringing my son up as a Christian and that she will tell them that she feels he is in danger.  One time she asked me what he was baptized as and I said well he is not. The next day as we were walking out she poured water on his head and said “I baptize you in the name of the lord!” I know I raise my son right he is only 18 months old he does not know the difference between religions and I plan to raise him and educate him on all religions like I did and let him make his own choices.

It's not the fast kind where the drums are going really fast and it's something you can dance to, as I said before it's really slow, really calm, something you could meditate to. And every once and while you'll hear a woman vocalizing, it wont be actual words, just random vowels.

20090227122335AAHFhdM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people deny Islam when it is the only religion that will be accepted by God?	1. Islam is the only religion that believes in One God (Allah) without associating anyone or anything with Him.   2. Islam is the only religion that believes in all the holy books including the Gospel, Torah, Bible, Quran.   3. Islam is the only religion that believes and loves all Prophets from Adam to Muhammed including Jesus.So why would not God love us when we love and believe in all His Prophets, while other religions deny our Prophet Muhammed. So who are the safe ones?   4. Islam is the only religion in which its holy book (the Quran) has no contradictions to it. I'm not talking about the ORIGINAL BOOKS, i'm talking about the holy books today that have been revised and changed by men to the point in which they contradict each other.   5. Islam is the only religion that demands us pray 5 times a day every day, not only sundays, or a day, and give charity.      So how is it that we are in the wrong path, when we worship One GOd, the Creator, and always thanking Him and believing in all His Prophets and Books and not associating anyone with Him by saying He has a son.  "Glory to Allah in which that they associate Him with."

20070906151320AAFahAE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jonathan Edwards?	Edwards talks about an "extraordinary opportunity" his congregation has. What is this opportunity? How does his sermon persuade the congregation to take advantage of this opportunity?      And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from the east, west, north, and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation   of spirit!        Therefore, let everyone that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging over a great part of this congregation: let everyone fly out of Sodom, "Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed"    A Sermon by Jonathan Edwards   Preached : July 8, 1741

Vivemos na era em que a convivencia ou unia? de costumes e habitos está presente em toda sociedade, dessa forma toda diversidade cultural serve para unir as diferen?as e conscientemente transforma -las em algo bom para a humanidade.           Na sociedade atual a convivencia com as diversas culturas podem ser estabelecidas pelo fato de costumes ou habitos de um povo apresentarem envolvimento e intera??o, dessa forma todas as diferen?as s?o esquecidas.Tudo isso é comprovado por meio de pesquisas onde apontam que nas sociedades indigenas há um la?o de conversas amigaveis com turistas. Mostra-se entao  uma supera??o das diferen?as existentes entre a cultura urbana e indigena.        Cabe entao que todo mundo saiba da cultura agregada em cada país, respeitando as diferen??s racias e etnicas para assim deixar um futuro melhor para as proximas gera??es.

My boyfriends family is having Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow night because of everyone schedule.  I decided to bring a carrot salad and I spent some time finding a good recipe.  I just told him and he told me it wasn't necessary because all the food is provided.  I said, I know but I'd like to and because it's a larger production I wanted to contribute something of mine.  His family is Mennonite and he said that people don't bring food to dinners.  It sounded like he was taking offence to me bringing a salad to share with everyone.  He even thinks it's weird when I told him I plan to bring a bottle of wine to his friends next weekend who are hosting a Thanksgiving dinner.  At Easter he made a big deal about me bringing a cake to his parents (I didn't end up going because of a family emergency on my end).  What if anything is so wrong about bringing something extra to share at dinner?  Does being Mennonite really have anything to do with it?

Isn't any loving home better for a child's welfare than having no home and no one to care about them at all?

20090306195734AAhRKW0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people lump religions together?	Most people think catholics and other christians are the same, they are very different in some cases. A lot of atheists even say Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Jews should be blamed for what only one of the religions accepts, or does. I disagree with the Catholic interpetaion of the bible. If atheists can think all religons are the same, then I can think all atheists are the same. Such as The Church of Satan saying "satanism starts with atheism."
20090306223317AAXzeO1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, answer the question If you REALLY believe. The bible take countless hours to read, this takes 2min?	Before I end for the night (I hope there is at least one intelligent reply when I get back) andgo to got the club, I ask this question to find if any of you (hopefully so) are open-minded and can be understanding of (not necessarily believe) other religions. First off I'm referring to the fictional character and not one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. The reason I ask is because there are numerous instances where the writer of the film (Vincent Gilligan whom is American of European decent) makes clear through, unsaid, terms that he's connecting Hancock to the Egyptian religion, and more specifically Heru the Sun God (becaue Egyptian hieroglyphs reffer to Heru "meaning Falcon." It's only Horus in Greek after they remixed it). All of these things had to be suggestive, and not specifically stated, as the whole point of making a movie is to make $$$$ (tha dolla dolla bill ya'll. 650 mill worldwide to be more precise.) And producers obviously didn't want a boycott by religions world wide. Whether it be one of the following:   1: ornaments hung around Hancock's trailer (of eagles/falcons)   2: insignia on Hancock's beanie throughout the beginning of the film   3: the pictures that he draws throughout (not knowing that it's a subconscious thing that he doesn't consciously remember)   4: the insignia on the back of his uniform (given to him by Ray)   5: the HUGE eagle/falcon statue he WALKS by in the bank robbery scene   6: finally, if you look at the Hancock poster, you can even see the eagle/falcon flying past the SUN in the reflection of Hancock's (Will Smiths) sunglasses. I don't wish to play the, "what color was jesus card." because I'm NOT even reffering to Jesus. (so save it.) I'm speaking of a completely different religion. SO, my question is which one, of the following, describes how you feel after reading this?      A. Like the movie before, now (adding everything up) I love it.   B. Like it before but now (since they weren't reffering to MY Jesus type God) I hate it   C. Disliked it before but (now adding it all up) I like it   D. Disliked it before but (now that I know it wasn't MY Jesus they had in mind) I HATE it even more.   E. Just a movie and, regarless of my religion, I think the same about it today that I did when I first saw it.      10pts to the best answer who explains why!

I think our house is haunted...   aside from: the sound radio music played at late night, lights turning on, cub boards closing, always cold, the sense of someone being here only when your alone...I think our house is haunted.

The first time was upstairs and there were no lights on(I did not get that on camera) but this one was near the fish tank and I had already turned the lights out(including the fish tank) and that is when I saw this again.     http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/b...

I am not a Catholic, but my friend is.

Why are you so often forgotten? Is it because we live in the West and  historical conflict is between Catholics and Protestants? I want your opinion. I wish all of you a spiritually enriching Lent!

I had a lot of different good friends in high school but the ones I connected with best either moved away or I moved out of the area. I met some new friends at a new school in 2000, but recently I stood up for a controversial issue that I believe in and many of my friends disagreed and argued,deleted me or started to ignore me. I met them in choir which was something that made us connect but, they were all in another after school group that wasn't me at all. After we graduated we still hung out, and even moved in with 1 of them, but the myspace thing made my friendships with them fall apart because they are too judgmental. I also tried to meet people at work and wanted to hang out with them, but most of them are snobby. What am I doing wrong? Why do I seem to be annoying everyone? I can't not stand up for something I believe so strongly in it would just seems wrong to me. What do I do?

I havnt put in any accents as its an oral presentation....Thanks for help!!!!!!!!xxx            Me encanta viajar porque me gust aver las otras culturas, hacer nuevas amistades y comer la comida diferente. Tengo bueno estrella porque he visite muchos paises como el Londres, la Francia, los Estados Unidos, la Italia, el Marruecos pero voy a Espana todos los a?os.   El a?o pasado, en Julio, visite a mi tio en Espana para unas vacaciones con mi amiga Sarah. Mi tio vive en Murcia y nos quedamos diez dias en su casa. Fue fantastico. El tiene tres dormitorios, dos cuartos de bano, un balcon y un solario. Hacia calor todos los dias pero no me puse moreno porque tuve el filtro solar. Llove mis sandalias, unas faldas, unos vestidos, unos pantalones cortos, unas camisetas , dos trajes de bano y mis gafas de sol. Ibamos a la playa todos los dias o de veces ibamos a la piscine cerca de la casa. Por la manana, hiciamos wind-surf, tomabamos el sol y nos banabamos. Al mediodia, ibamos a un restaurante de la playa y un dia comimos una paella buenisima. Durante nuestra estancia, conducia el coche de mi tio. Estaba nervioso porque estaba conduciendo a la izquierda. El ultimo dia lloramos porque no quisimos volver a Irlanda.   Hace dos a?os, en el invierno, pase mis vacaciones en Nueva York. Fui con mis dos tias y mi amiga qui se llama Yvonne. Viajamos en avion de Dublin y el vuelo duro seis horas. Tuvimos jetlag y estuvimos muy cansadas eso dia. Ibimos a Nueva York porque quisimos ir de expedicion a las tiendas y yo quise visitor los lugares se interes. Nos quedamos la semana en un hotel de cuatro estrellas y fue muy bonito. Llove un abrigo, unas botas, una bufanda, unos guantes y un sueter de lana porque hacia frio y nevaba. Un dia fuimos al cine y vimos una pelicula de terror. No me la gusto porque fue con subtitulos pero compre muchos dulces y palomitas y fueron delicioso. Trajimos mucho dinero a Nueva York. Anduvimos a las tiendas todos los dias. El primero dia, visitamos a una zapateria porque mis tias les encantan los zapatos pero no compraron ningun. Yo compre unas botas negras y unas zapatos de tacon alto. Estuvieron en venta. Despues, fuimos a una tienda de ropa. Me probe una camiseta y un vestido pero la camiseta me quede apretada y el vestido fue demasiado caro. Yvonne probo un abrigo y un sueter gris. Les llevo y pago con tarjeta de credito. Almorzamos en un restaurante pequeno y comi un perro caliente con papas fritas. Nuestras pies fueron muy cansadas. Luego, visitamos una joyeria y miramos a unos arêtes de oro y un reloj pero no fueron de Buena calidad y fueron mas caro de mi casa. Por la ultima noche, fuimos al teatro en Broadway y vimos el musical Mama Mia. Hicimos muchas fotos.    Me gustaria volver a Espana esto verano y mejorar mi espanol pero tengo que encontrar un trabajo y ganar dinero.

20090227130045AAmjBub	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is It Wrong To Investigate Churches Only For Intellectual Interests?	I admit, I'm fascinated by churches and their teachings, but I'm not what you would call "Christian"  I believe in God somewhat but I refuse to follow the rules/beliefs of one church (religion is not the same as spirituality).  Overall, I view religion and the Bible as intellectual reading material only.      I'm not here to argue and I mean no offense.      This may be an obvious question, but I want to attend several churches just to check out what is going on and learn about church environments in general.  I actually love some of the stories in the Bible, but I see it as that, just stories and myths that create our own culture.      Would it be incredibly crude to visit a church for intellectual purposes only? I want to visit and see them all (Mormon, Assembly of God, Evangelical, Catholics, Buddhist, etc).      Please I mean no offense, so please don't say I'm going to hell.

Does anyone have any help? Please. And prayers are very welcome.

20090109003729AABL1SB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I just seriously don't get Christianity...?	And why so many people flock towards that religion. Same with most others, but I guess I can (kinda) understand Judaism.       I've read 3 different versions of the bible, and I still don't get it! >:O   Is it because so many people are afraid of hell?       Let's say   A)heaven and hell do exist   B)you die a Christian.   Then: you Go to heaven and have nothing to worry about~      But if:   A)Heaven and hell exist   B)you die with other beliefs   then C) You go to Hell, even if you're a good person.      Quite seriously, neither exists. Even if it did and I went to hell, that's cool with me. :D As humans, it's not actually dying we're afraid of, but living with pain. Therefore, if you were able to detach yourself from pain, nothing would bug you in hell =D   So~Buddhism makes a lot more sense to me....      But back to the question:   Why do so many people flock towards Christianity?   Another one of my theories is that people need someone to follow and tell them what's right and wrong; what to do with their lives; why the world is the way it is; where did we come from; where are we going; what is our purpose?       Enough of my rambling~      Everyone share their thoughts please :D   Since it's mostly Atheists vs. Christians in here   Atheists: why do so many people flock towards Christianity?   Christians: Why did you chose your religion, why'd you keep it?

It didn't say anything about covering your hair. I have been wearing the hijab for nine years and then new theories start to appear. Who should I believe?  I want proof.
20090227125643AAcMUFR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is Obama President b/c 'whites' are not as racist as 'blacks?'?	1st I'd just like to say that I am so sick of President Obama being called nothing but Black when he is mixed - half white and half black so people might as well call him white and it would be just as innacurate.      Second of all.. it's quite apparent to me that like Obama or not, he is President thanks to the fact that white people as a whole are not racist whereas black people are extremely racist. Black vote for Black.  If White only voted for White like if say 90% of white people voted for McCain, Obama never would have had a shot but they didn't..   b/c policy came first, not color.      Compare that to like 90+% of black people that voted for Obama and you KNOW that most voted for him just b/c he's black.   And before I hear the excuse that black people always vote Democrat  let's get real..   If McCain was the Democrat and Obama was the Republican, I would bet my life that 90 plus percent of black people would not be voting Democrat and for McCain.  Magically.. they would all become Republicans overnight.      These are facts.  I am not racist.  I liked Obama and voted for him but I am sick of no one acknowledging the fact that he is only president b/c white people as a race are not racist whereas black people who voted for him in droves b/c he's simply black ARE.

20090307011811AAiirKS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How come you never hear about emmett till when the civil rights movement is mentioned?	I mean we hear about rosa parks and mlk and others but you never hear about emmett till. His death pretty much sparked the civil rights movement. It got blacks to finally stand and demand their rights. Is it because the crime was so ugly??        for anyone wo doesn't know the story- Emmett till was a 13 yr old boy from chicago who went to visit his relatives in missispee. While there he was accused of whistling at a white women. He was dragged from his aunt's home in the middle of the night and was beaten to death. They later tied his leg to an anchor and threw him in a river. When they found him he was unreckonizable. It was one of the worst crimes against a child in us history.       Now mlk and rosa parks are vital when talking about the civil rights movement but till's death is one of the main causes. Can someone tell me why they don't talk about him in school???

20090307011621AA4jUqL	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is this a real friend?	I've never had a ton of friends; I much prefer a smaller group of friends. At this moment, however, I'm wondering if I have any friends at all.       I have this one (straight) friend, and we've known each other for around 4 years or so. I came out to him 4-5 months ago, he was ok with it. Before I came out to him, I would always discuss with him whatever relationship type issues he'd have, be it a girl he liked, or problems he was having with a certain girl. Well anyway, one day, long after I came out to him, I mentioned how I was seeing an ex of mine on a much-more-than-desired basis. That was it. I didn't mention anything more than that. Of course I said I didn't want to see the guy anymore and that I didn't really want to say hi, even though I felt I should. That conversation with him (over AIM), ended with him telling me it was awkward and that we shouldn't talk about relationships anymore.      I didn't say it at the time, but I was, and still am very hurt by it. I mean, it's not like I started spouting out sexual details. I was just mentioning this important part of what was going on with me. We go out with other friends and guess what's talked about? You got it, his girl problems/issues/etc. Was I wrong in expecting someone who I figured was a true friend to at least listen to the said problem without telling me what he did? I mean, it sucks for me, because I'm going through something right now, and really wish I had that friend to talk with about it (it's actually kinda funny, not pouty/omg emo), but it does deal in relationships.       So I guess what I'm basically asking is, what should I do? I'm obviously very hurt by this, and it's been bugging me since it happened. I just unfortunately feel like I've pulled the short stick in choosing my short-list of friends, or in this case, friend.

I'm sure there are some people who believe that everything that happened was an accident. Being a Muslim I believe that everything which exists is because God wanted it this way. he ordered, and the earth was made, not only earth but everything, all the stars, planets, everything. So are us, we were planned to exist. it was no accident. Science say that the earth was made because of THE BIG BANG.. But how can it be? I mean, someone is there who made the planets which afterward the hit each other or whatever which made the earth and our solar system. If its true that God has made other planet, is it possible that God hasn't made Earth too? How can it be possible? If possible, then why don't we create another "BIG BANG" and made another earth so life would be possible there too? And how is it possible that our life is just an ACCIDENT? does it make sense? If a chair, house, table can't be built itself then how can this whose universe, and us come into being ourselves? try to answer as many as u can please :P   No racism please.

Is it because they have something that they don't have? When I mean by Christian, I mean the kind that loves God and loves everyone in a real Christian way, to like them and care about them; no matter what their background.  There are some that do show hatred, but they shall be judged before God and will have do give an account just like everyone else will.  Is it because Atheists don't have indisputable evidence to prove God doesn't exist no matter what? Or is it because Atheists believe in so many chance happenings and Christians seemed to have found something amazing that gives utter joy?  I don't know.  I want to know is it against the Christians I have explained above or those who are confused and should not be in the Church as they cannot lead a Church with a clean heart.  These aren't Christians.

He was using a verse to tempt Christ.      So can the "Word of God" turn into the "Word of the Devil," depending on who is quoting from it?

So I've heard things like, a woman giving birth to a child was about to die and she saw the line of light or something and saw her grandparents waving to her. Then there's this woman who was unconscious, then woke up telling stories about what she saw during that time. Is it just some mind chemical, dream, or is it true?? And how can a person have a concussion for like 14 years without dying? somthing about plugging in a plug......

20090306164924AA0h4qW	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I tell this GIRL that I wanna “CHILL” without seeming too desperate?	I have known a girl in University for a few months. We are both studying master’s degrees. We exchanged email and phone contact information. She would usually invite me over to her place for coffee. We would talk, chill, and watch a movie for a few hours. Oneday, she seemed in need of emotional support. She invited me in her bed. We started kissing, holding hands, and cuddling. However, we had no sex. Anyways, we still hung out together. She told me that she was divorced and has a child from a previous marriage. I still enjoy her company. The past month was quite busy due to end of term assignments. I called her last week when I was done my assignments. She sounded happy to talk to me. She definitely said that she wanted to meet and properly catch up. She said she would call. She said that she has been doing research in the library for a main research paper. Then she went home for a few days. I literally talked with her last week. Should I wait for her to call me or should I just give a casual call next week? Maybe a casual call to see how things are going and if she’s in a mood to chill?

20070224090053AA2UPbN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I want to be closer to God once more but I want the Christian community to accept my homosexuality?	I was raised Roman Catholic, and since I got onto Yahoo Answers, I've rejected my religion, but seeing the destructive and carefree almost drugged-out like attitude of 3 or 4 users in the Yahoo Answers LGBT section is making me rethink about my commitment to God. I want to be gay and christian, but both of these groups can't seem to get along, and I feel stuck in the middle. What sort of advice would you give to a gay christian like myself? I don't want to be like those 3 or 4 drugged out sounding users I mentioned -- it is horrible to be like that: no responsibilites, no feelings, rude, violent, destructive etc. I do believe part of the hardcore gay culture is to blame for these people's destructive lifestyle, but a gay man can life a productive, loving life and still be a committed Christian. What should I do now?
20090306195223AAjNpxj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Christians, could you help me with this issue?	Ok, sometime ago, my dad told me that someday, I'll get married & when I do, & find out my husband is a "porn" watcher, I should try to watch it with him, instead of going against him.  When I heard this, I was very shocked cause I know it's sin & cause it was coming from my dad who is a Christian dad & never expected to hear this from him.  I'm a Christian & know that porn is dead wrong.  A pastor said the usual stuff about porn that it is lust, it’s immoral & that people who watch it are desperate.  But one great point I heard is that husbands who watch it, will compare his wife to those porn actresses – his view of his wife could be that of her not being as pretty & sexually exciting as those in the video- by the way, those porn girls’ D cups, orgasms, actions are all fake.  I really dislike the idea of my man watching/fantasizing other girls.  I tried to understand what my dad was trying to tell me, like “don’t panic” or “be a companion for him in that” but then I thought, it’s not something like learning a sport or dance together, it’s PORN!!!  I still strongly disagree with him.  If I found out that my husband watches porn, I’d pray about it, not do watch it with my husband.  Yes, I would talk to him about it, but I know I could not change him but only God’s grace.  What are your opinions on this??  Are any of you Christian wives going through this issue & how are you cooperating with it?  I really would appreciate your opinions.  Thanks in advance.  Christian husbands are welcome to answer.  It’s ok if you agree with my dad, I just want to know where you stand honestly.

Leviticus 20:13      It is clear as day to me, unchanged central theme in every bible version... the answer to dealing with gays is simple, put to death... do you disagree with god?

When i got home, i was on the verge on going back because I was so turned on and i was thinking with the wrong head. Instead of going back though I chose to relieve myself, so I didn't do anything stupid with that other girl. Do you think God can forgive me?! Am I horrible for breaking Lent?! HELP!

Here is what I was sent about it:      The theme for the sermon is: "Being A Fruit Bearing Church; Passionate Worship"    The message is:  The heart of passionate worship is the changing of hearts, redeeming of souls, and transformation of lives.      The scripture verse:  Psalm 84    Your target audience is ages 2 - 8.    At the time for the Children's message, we usually invite them up to the front of the sanctuary, have some type of story or message (props or visual aids are welcome) and then close with a prayer.  You can say the prayer or you can have them repeat it after you.      If you have any experience with Sunday School teaching or any kind of religious background and could help me I would REALLY appreciate it. Thanks a ton in advance!

So there is no such thing as a "Roman Catholic".That phrase was coined by Henry 8th because he still wanted to be known as Catholic even after he forced the English church to split from Rome.

20081011143826AAqrGwg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think most Neo-Darwinists are also Chauvinists?	   I think this is true of much of the academic and scientific establishment. Darwin himself shows a tendency to be highly sexist in his theory of "sexual selection" an extension of "natural selection".      Many women, such as the biologist Lynn Margulis, have objected to the Neo-Darwinist orthodoxy on the grounds that it is just that and have forumlated their own symbiotic and/or vitalist interpretation of evolution.      Do you think that women have the power to overthrow the male-centric account of the origin of life on earth?      Is the biggest threat to the modern synthesis not creationists but instead feminists?
