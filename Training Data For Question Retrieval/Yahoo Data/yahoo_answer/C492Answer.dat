Deberas ser ms conciente y seria. An eres peque?a, no te apures... Haz que tu compa?ero use siempre condon y t toma pastillas anticonceptivas (no la del da despus).

Es hasta cierto punto normal que tengas reacciones secundarias al tomarla, pero no por eso debes de dejar de visitar a un mdico.  Sinceramente creo que debes platicar con tu mam o por lo menos con alguien en quien confes y que sea mayor que tu, de preferencia algn familiar, por que la verdad es que si estas un poco chica, pero si ya decidiste empezar con tu vida sexual y as vas a seguir mientras ests con tu novio, sera bueno que ambos acudan con un doctor para que los oriente acerca de mtodos anticonceptivos, aunque yo pienso que lo mejor para ti es que el usara condn, ya que adems previene enfermedades venreas y no va a alterar tu organismo.

AA11529966	"Potato varieties are classified according to their growing season. Potatoes that are taken out of the ground earlier than the others in the crop are called "new" or "earlies". The ones that are harvested later are known as "maincrop" and are also delicious and nutritious."|`|AA11471904	Potatoes are storable for longer periods than any other vegetables. The counting starts from the time the potatoes are dug out of ground and they are stored. The longer the storage the drier they become. The fresh potatoes (new) are reasonably wet or contain water and are heavier in weight than the old dried up ones. Since they are fresh and not dried up the nutritions which survive only when there is moisture will be lost when they totally dry up. Hence new potatoes  may be considered as more nutritious than the dried up ones. However the dried up ones are more tasty and good to eat. Also the old potatoes do not rot easily as that of new ones and all the spoilt ones are naturally removed by the sellers and you get the best & filtered ones. Again people say that new potatoes produce less gas than the old ones and hence are more healthy to eat.|`|68530930c642e83d556721cb7b8d39b5aa	Give the Prize to  ...... nancy r.

If it becomes an issue when you hit about 13 - 15 years then yes, I would say you are a litttle underwheight. I was 5'2" when I got married and weighed 108. You are a little thin, but with an active lifestyle and your age- you will probably be fine. I worried myself sick with my girls at this age b/c I thought the same thing (they could get by with a girl's 12 too) and then realized they were on the go all the time. I would be concerned if you dropped below 100 lbs. You also carry a lot of muscle if you play sports and that in itself will cause you to burn more fat.   As far as my girls-They are out of school now and it is catching up w/them (wink). They are by no means large, about 115 lbs which is normal for the height. They wear about a size 4/6  -not bad given the avg. size is 12.  **** Please do not fall into the self image whirlwind.

Stay under 1200 calories per day, INCLUDING DRINKS such as soda, and do some excersizes. NO PAIN NO GAIN. Just eating like this will help lose fat fast, but your skin wont look as good if you dont do some excersizes too. If you did this, you would probably lose 10-15 lbs in just a few weeks. I did, and I've kept it off since may and I look and FEEL great. I give myself ONE day a week to eat whatever I want, and giving up soda was hard, but SO worth it. Those are all just empty calories.

A much safer bet is to watch portion size, cut out all that refined sugar processed junk food crap, and stick to nice fresh "whole" foods(fresh fruits and veggies, lean meats, poultry fish) For treats low-fat, sugar-reduced ice creams, etc.    The bottom line, moderation.     Also, get out and get some exercise....    A more realistic weight loss goal is a pound a week.

If you are already fairly lean, that could mean that you are adding adipocyte cells (fat cells) that you will never be able to lose without surgery.    This 1-2 pound per month gain is only possible if your nutritional, supplementation, training, rest, and recovery approaches are ideal.  Otherwise, you're looking at slower gains.    Eat LOTS of clean, healthy calories from fruits, vegetables, lean protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs spread over 4-6 meals and snacks, 2-4 hours apart.      Train regularly with heavy weights (don't follow any workouts in any bodybuilding publications unless you're on steroids), and shoot for 10-15 pounds per year.|`|4ad97a71ac6040083a4c9e623d145486aa	I am guessing that you want to gain weight in a healthy and attractive way, which is best accomplished through exercise.    If you've never been active before, start by walking, riding a bike, or swimming. Running is good if you can. Work up to 30-45 minutes, 4-5 times a week, working hard enough that you are breathing heavy. If you are just starting out, that is enough to build some muscle and get in shape. And it's free! If you already are active and want to improve your appearance, then you need to start a weight lifting program.    It's sounds easy to take some powder, or shake, or just eat a lot to gain some weight. But that works best when you are working your muscles really hard, so the extra protien and energy build muscles. If you aren't exercising enough to burn off those extra calories, then the only thing you will gain is extra flab on your legs, arms, and a growing pot belly.

The women in Lauren study reported that they used high fat, sugary foods as a source of comfort, to cope with the stresses of menopause as well as the challenges of running busy lives and families. If you feel that you have the tendency to comfort eat, make sure that you have a back-up plan for when these moods strike. Do things that make you feel good, but take you away from food. Have a bubble bath, phone a friend or take the dog for a walk.    Have a look at your food choices and look out for those high fat extras such as a few biscuits here or there, or that after dinner chocolate or that handful of biscuits with a drink before dinner.    A large percentage of women have tried and failed on numerous weight loss diets over their lifetime. Now is the time to look at day to day food choices.    Women also tend to continue to eat to the appetite of the family or partner rather then their own - for example, they eat dinner when they're not hungry, because they have prepared a meal for the family. To work around this look at the energy density of meals and snacks earlier in the day.    Fill up your sandwich with salad rather then excessive quantities of protein or fats. Plan a nutritious afternoon tea including portioned dried fruit, tubs of low fat yoghurt or a low fat milk hot chocolate. Watch the predinner nibbling  10 potatoes chips is the equivalent of 3 lamb cutlets or 20 prawns. Add a glass of wine to this (another 10 prawn equivalents) and its no wonder you dont feel like dinner. If the predinner nibble is an important time to wind down, try rice crackers with salsa (you can have nearly 20 of these instead of the chips) or a couple of microwaved pappadums.    Try to prepare your main meal at home as much as possible, or if you do need to rely on takeaways, go for the lower fat options.    Check your dinner portions. Make sure that you fill at least 1/2 the plate with vegies, include a couple of chat potatoes or 1 2 slices of sweet potato. Keep the meat to the size of your fingertips or one chicken kebab, or include a hand of fish, or include 10 prawns in a stir-fry.

Chase     To dream that you are being chased, signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity. In particular, to dream that you are chased by an animal, represents your own unexpressed and unacknowledged anger which is being projected onto that animal. Alternatively, you may be running away from a primal urge or fear.|`|468bfe1ca1f7ecc2b5ac2f2bcdb36c26aa	don't be afraid. understand the difference between dreams and real life. if dreams have to be true then why not good ones.|`|69115afb76146940fd58ad5bd1617467aa	http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/searchcsv.p...    look at this|`|AA11595410	Dreams can be prophetic or simply an expression of ones feelings. In both cases interpretation can usually be a matter of observation. The chase as a course of prophetic observation indicates an event in your life that may or may not be in your control or a future event you know about that is causing you anxiety because you feel helpless in it approach. In expressive terms is could be you feel trapped in a situation and cannot escape it, however since the person chasing you seems to be in charge, I should think it would be an event or person in your life you feel threatened by because you feel you have no control, or you have given them more control than you should have.

My workouts always suffer with an empty stomach.|`|AA11642943	I do it all the time, hasn't killed me yet and I lost 40 pounds.

How much did you eat in that period? How much did you exercize? You can't eat a yogurt then jump on the treadmill to burn off those 100 calories, it doesn't work that way. Trying to lose weight? Cut out just 100 cals a day. In an average woman, that translates to a pound a week lost. Stop trying to use tricks- if there was a shortcut, someone would have figured it out by now.|`|c222262ec43d3e2ededcf13c811e2412aa	When you exercise on an empty stomach, something builds up on the back of your head (and neck) area and you get serious headache...that's what I read somewhere.|`|b9fc213b9d2a6605ea9a4f6ebddc068baa	No...nothing will happen. I've done a 4 hour work-out without touching food ALL DAY. I'm a bit of a nut though...so maybe you should'nt try this. If you don't feel faint from not having eaten, then you are fine. But you must drink and replace fluids when you work out. That is much more important.    Oh and...if you exercise in the afternnon or evening, you usually have a better work-out because your muscles will be warm from using them all day...your muscles are stiffer in the morning.    Always warm up your muscles and stretch a bit before a work-out to avoid injuries.|`|AA10314296	i feel that it's not bad but i would eat first then workout to work off the food
50d478dd9eb6e820b0de3fe8ae772853aa	i've been wrestling for 4 years,   what i use to drop pounds is eat straight protein and fruits....dont touch anything with carbs in it.  exercising helps of course.   or you could go on the classic starvation diet,  ricecakes and water.   when you eat those and drink the water the rice expands making you think that you're full.  try it|`|AA11570293	YOU are KILLING YOURSELF!!!  Dont' let anyone tell you that carbs are no good as they are what is used for energy and you have to have energy to live and get down the road.  Drink lots of water but use a lot of fruits and veggies, raw for the most part and add a few nuts and grains in for your protein.  Leave off the high fat meat and you will be much better off but make it a lifestyle change or you will gain it all back and then some when you get off your "diet".  If you doubt what I am telling you, look at the Asian population and ask yourself where are the fat ones?  Unless you find one that has been on the typical American diet of the high fat, high cholesterol diet, you will find a slim, trim person that eats almost nothing but carbs.  Rice is carbs, my friend.  They eat an abundence of rice and then add some veggies and a few nuts for the protein and I would challenge you to find anyone that would be stronger or live longer.  When you eat the meats, you slow your system and if you find a true athlete that knows anything about nutrition, you will find that when you need energy and lots of it you eat lots of carbs and very little protein or it will slow you down.  those that need more strength and energy will go for mainly the carbs for the energy and very little protein.  check out the site below as this is the address of a doctor that can direct you from a medical point of view what is best and he can tell you if what I am telling you is correct.  Dont' try to lose so much so fast.  When you do that, your body just shuts down and goes into survival mode so when you start to eat again, you gain back what you lost and then some to make sure you don't starve next time.  Slow and easy is the key.|`|AA12149336	your body is in starvation mode honey.... that's not healhty  u gotta eat well and have a healthy lifestyle. starving urself/ taking pills will decrease your body's ability to function the way it should. sooner or later your body will shut down. trust me.... take care hun....|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	Yikes!

Good luck!|`|e7f7530cc6fdf906d76dc8109fd56c80aa	The best way to lose weight and maintain it is gradual reduction of calories with increase in physical activity. Water is good to drink, so keep drinking it. However, you got to make sure that you still consume all your nutrients and vitamins, such as calcium and iron, potassium and vitamins A, B12, C, D,...etc. I suggest that you go to the website at the source to help create a personalized diet plan, and I hope that you seek some professional help from your doctor, school nurse, or a registered dietitian. Good luck!|`|7fa3208e1c57ea6cce6252be3a9bcf92aa	I believe the best way to lose weight (and do so safely), is combined diet and exercise. Walking, swimming, bike, etc...Subsitute high fatty foods for something more healthy, yet is still appetizing. If your body feels like it is starving or being punished, you might mess up on your diet. You have to reward yourself from time to time or you'll be miserable. The key is to burn more than you take in. By starving yourself, you'll be losing more water weight than actual fat. That's why you allow yourself to eat (energy/healthy choices), and exercise to burn fat. Find a walking buddy to stick to your routine. The way I look at it is, " it took me a while to put it on, it'll take a while to get off." I didn't put on all this weight overnight, so I can't expect it to disappear too quickly. Consistency is the key. It'll take hard work, but it'll pay off. When you see results, it'll give you all the more motivation to keep at it. If you mess up a bit, don't be too hard on yourself. Remind yourself the reasons why you want to lose this weight. Hopefully, for yourself. Best wishes! I'm cheering you on, but don't be too hard on yourself.

4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	Sneezing, also known as sternutation, is the response of the mucous membrane of the nose to an irritant or foreign body that causes allergy in a hypersensitive person.    A sneeze is an involuntary explosive burst of air from the nose and mouth that removes offending material from the nasal passages.    Causes & Symptoms    Sneezing can occur from a number of causes, or may itself be a symptom of an underlying condition, most likely an allergy or common cold. Sneezing may simply be triggered by a small foreign object or substance in the nose, including particles of pepper, smoke, irritating chemical fumes, or gases. It may also be a symptom of a common cold, upper respiratory tract infection, hay fever, or other allergies to pollen, dust, dust mites, mold, dander, grass, or other substances. Additional potential causes of sneezing include withdrawal from opiate drugs, inhaling corticosteroids, whooping cough, or anaphylaxis. Many people sneeze when they step outdoors into bright sunlight. Others report sneezing whenever they tweeze their eyebrows-.|`|298574ebd480e066c2b6e29e1c578b4aaa	Sneezing is a way that your body gets rid of bad things that are in your nose. These things might be bacteria, germs, and other things. You also sneeze when you smell pepper because your body does not like pepper!|`|5c43980ca367e1bb58fe9e120a8a159faa	Sneezing is generally caused by irritation and some times bacterial clog up in the throat, lungs or in the passages of the nose. Allergens such as pollens, pet dander, house dust mites, as well as nonallergenic particles are usually harmless, but when they irritate the nose the body responds by expelling them from the nasal passages. The nose mistakes strong odors, sudden chills, bright lights (see photic sneeze reflex), and even orgasms in some people for nasal irritants, and it tries to defend itself with a sneeze.

AA10354950	I started painting & ceramics in 1979. For me- it works. I get to use my imagination & project it in my work. I had forgotten what a joy it is to truly let go & forget the things that really dont matter anyhow. I havent painted anything for several years & sometimes things happen to make you realize you lost that joy. I recently ( Sat.) had a tragedy. I lost someone I loved very much. It might seem strange to you, but it was my pet. I wanted to honor him because he deserves it. So yesterday I went to the ceramics store & picked out the perfect container for his ashes. I have already drawn the design I will paint on it & know that I will be happy when I am finished with it & his spirit knows how much I love him. Till we meet again. It eases the pain.

AA10299265	Actually, it's a form of self preservation. If you get too close or involved with someone who's in the self destruct mode, you tend to get dragged down into their nightmare. That's one reason they say not to try to help an addict, just listen to them and offer support, just don't get so involved that it takes away from your life. I was living near the edge and no one could reach me. It took a near death experience and a hospital stay to wake me up. Once awakened, it was just a matter of learning how to live life again. Sometimes people cannot be reached and you definitely don't want to be there when they reach their "Point of Know Return".|`|539234e646f221d76fcd83d56b13dd48aa	All religions enjoin humans to live unselfishly. Witnessing someone help others selflessly is as spiritual an experience as seeing a devotee praying to God. Such a one cannot be confined within the selfish centre of 'me' and 'mine'. When you work unselfishly, you lose your 'I'. Every unselfish action takes us a little closer to the Supreme Consciousness.     On the other hand, every selfish action acts as an obstruction to our finding the Divine Truth. Once, Ramakrishna was talking to his devotees. "Compassion to all creatures..."  so saying he went into a samadhi . After gaining consciousness he said: "An insignificant worm crawling on Earth, who are you to show compassion to others? Serve man, recognising him to be the manifestation of God."     Ramakrishna's disciple Swami Vivekananda coined the word ' Daridranarayan '  God in the form of the poor  and said: "Where should you go to seek God? Are not all the poor, the miserable and the weak, gods?"     Lord Krishna reveals to Arjuna the secret of success in all undertakings  spiritual or material  "Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred on the Self, without hope or ego, freed from fever, fight on" (3-30). One who can work in this manner arrives at the same stage as a religious man ( bhakta ) does through his prayers and the wise man ( gyani ) through his knowledge.     A devotee always has God in mind; a philosopher lives with the knowledge that the world is a delusion. The unattached worker has love for the universe in his mind. He treats all duties as means with which selfishness may be overcome. A sincere worker need not believe in God or mukti ; yet, he finds the Ultimate Truth by unselfish work.     A nurse loves the employer's baby. Even then, if she is asked to leave, she does just that and begins work again in another household, looking after another baby. Be like the nurse, Ramakrishna advised, and know that God is our employer. When one works with detachment and freedom then there is no tension.     But, thinking that the world needs our help gives rise to attachment, arrogance and pain. It is the giver who is blessed, not the receiver. Lord Krishna said to Arjuna: "Look at Me. If I stop work for even a moment, the whole universe will cease to exist. I have nothing to gain from work; but I work incessantly without attachments" (3-22).     God is detached because He really loves the world. Rather His love is real and that is why He is detached. Real love can never produce pain or jealousy, which is slavery. A mother loves her children selflessly. When one can give to the world like a mother only then can one realise Divinity through work.     There is another way in which selfless work can be put in practice  by offering everything to one's God, by working as if it were worship. Swami Ranganathananda, president, Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math, says that the presence of love for a particular cause can make the work light and enjoyable.     Absence of love for the work makes it a boring exercise. Work becomes drudgery when something is wrong with the mind. When the mind is disciplined and detached, working will mean relaxation.     One need not go on a holiday just in order to take a break from work  work should be treated as relaxation. Holidays should be a passage from one joy to another and not from boredom to joy.     When the idea of doing good becomes a habit then one need not seek any reason to do unselfish work. As Swami Vivekananda said, "That which is selfish is immoral and that which is unselfish is moral".|`|cd54f5008550adf29bece96b61196450aa	Emotional detachement is what it states in one nutshell. You can always remain empathetic to any cause but not allow it to take over your life and drag you down.   E.G dealing with a family member who always chooses to make the wrong choice, instead of feeling the pain and suffering one decides to be empathetic and support them through the consequences they now have to deal with.
AA12200754	when aroused, blood floods into the penis, engorging it, causing the erection.    bottom line-----thank God for blood.|`|AA11134384	Blood is pumped into it    A penile erection occurs when two tubular structures that run the length of the penis, the corpora cavernosa, become engorged with venous blood. This may result from any of various physiological stimuli. The corpus spongiosum is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa, which contains the urethra, through which urine and semen pass during urination and ejaculation, respectively. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.    Penile erection usually results from sexual stimulation and/or arousal, but can also occur by such causes as a full urinary bladder or spontaneously during the course of a day or at night, often during erotic or wet dreams (see "nocturnal penile tumescence"). An erection results in swelling and enlargement of the penis. Erection enables sexual intercourse and other sexual activities (sexual functions), though it is not essential for all sexual activities.  A circumcised penis flaccid (left) and erect (right)  A circumcised penis flaccid (left) and erect (right)    In the presence of mechanical stimulation, erection is initiated by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with minimal input from the central nervous system. Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the arteries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches initiate the release of nitric oxide, a vasodilating agent, in the target arteries. The arteries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile arteries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue.    The cerebral cortex can initiate erection in the absence of direct mechanical stimulation (in response to visual, auditory, olfactory, imagined, or tactile stimuli) acting through erectile centers in the lumbar and sacral regions of the spinal cord. The cortex can suppress erection even in the presence of mechanical stimulation, as can other psychological, emotional, and environmental factors.|`|69115afb76146940fd58ad5bd1617467aa	it turns to wood :D|`|AA11958479	it fills up with blood|`|1d515245a4e55672060ad5bbd205c6b0aa	when you get an erection blood flows to your penis causing it to become hard|`|54e0d46126c6d012d5bdf62a51ff02d8aa	The penis is made of porous tissue that fills up with blood when you get aroused or horny,  Your body pumps a lot of blood into it until these tissues are full and the pressure of the blood makes your penis feel hard almost as if there's a bone in it, but actually its just blood.

546725083512044916c7f428bee62f54aa	Leben braucht Trost, das ist in schlimmen Situationen einfach Seelennahrung. Und sein wir doch mal ehrlich, wir alle hoffen doch, auf welchen Wegen auch immer, niemals Aids zu bekommen oder auch an Krebs zu erkranken. Doch ist das garantiert? Nein. Und gerade Aids hat Uebertragungswege, welche keiner von uns 100 %ig im Griff hat. Da gibt es mehr als bunten Sex.   Ich denke es ist eine Frage die Du Dir beantworten musst und zwar, nachdem Du Dir Zeit fuer die Ueberlegung genommen hast. Richtig gut Zeit um einmal Dich selber zu fragen, wie Du Dich am wohlsten fuehlst. Ueber die Mitleidsschiene hinweg oder wie gucken die jetzt bloss. Sondern wie geht der Krankheitsweg weiter, brauche ich die Mitmenschen, bin ich selber so unendlich stark dass ich irgendwann einen vielleicht letzten Weg alleine gehen kann. Meine Gedanken hierzu sind, wenn es gute ehrliche Freunde sind, dann tragen sie nicht nur die guten Zeiten mit. Ich stelle natuerlich auch fest, dass die Welt k?lter und der Mensch fast zu einem Wegwerfprodukt geworden ist. Ich hoffe bei Dir ist es anders. Heute bist Du betroffen, morgen er. Wer kann sich davon freimachen? Ich denke es ist wichtig dass wir akzeptieren dass Krankheit und Tod zu unserem Leben geh?ren. Auch erstmal zum Glueck nur Theoretisch. Aber die Gespr?che auch ueber diese Themen k?nnen helfen. Und wenn es Freunde sind die nicht nur die Oberfl?che leben, dann kann es klappen, dass sie dich mittragen. Bitter ist es, wenn es nicht klappt. Dann erh?lst Du neben der Krankheit noch ein weiteres Problem. Aber ich denke Krankheit ist auch Chance. Man kann Lebenssituationen noch einmal bearbeiten, ver?ndern, intensiver wahrnehmen. Und ich finde es fair, gerade wenn es eine bedrohliche Krankheit ist, dass Menschen die einem nahestehen dieses erfahren. Auch sie haben ein Recht auf Kl?rung und vielleicht noch Wege, die sie noch mitDir gehen m?chten. Ich hoffe nicht, dass es so schlecht steht.

Sollte man es solange fr sich behalten bis es nicht mehr geht oder offen darber reden?  offen darueber reden ist immer besser.        Ist es schlimmer keinen Trost von Freunden und Familie gespendet zu bekommen oder bemitleidet zu werden?  noch schlimmer ist es allein mit sich auszumachen.        Ist es schlimmer ein Geheimnis zu bewahren oder immer nur mit traurigen Augen angesehen zu werden?      schlimmer ist das geheimnis fuer dich.

Gute Nacht! :-)|`|570cbbc8a62ed08b7659d460bb3d84f7aa	Schlaf ist lebensnotwendig fr die Regeneration von K?rper und Geist. Auf Dauer fhren Schlafst?rungen zu Leistungsabfall, Gereiztheit und Unaufmerksamkeit. Das individuelle Schlafbedrfnis ist unterschiedlich und nimmt vom S?uglingsstadium zum Alter hin st?ndig ab. Ein Erwachsener ben?tigt ca. 7-8 Stunden Schlaf, ein alter Mensch meist nur noch 5-6 Stunden. Dies sollte man bedenken, wenn alte Menschen ber Schlafst?rungen klagen. W?hrend der Schlafenszeit durchl?uft der Mensch verschiedene Schlafphasen, die sich in ihrer Schlaftiefe unterscheiden. Bei einem normalen Schlafverlauf steigt die Schlaftiefe nach dem Einschlafen stark an, nimmt dann ab und geht zum Morgen hin in eine mittlere konstante Schlaftiefe ber. Bei Schlafst?rungen unterscheidet man zwischen Einschlafst?rungen und Durchschlafst?rungen. Eine h?ufiges Problem ?lterer Menschen ist auch das zu frhe Erwachen am Morgen, also eine Durchschlafst?rung.              Zu den psychovegetativen Beschwerden geh?ren Nervosit?t und Angst sowie depressive Verstimmungen. Bei st?ndiger Unruhe und gesteigertem Antrieb spricht man von Nervosit?t. Der Ausl?ser fr Nervosit?t ist immer psychischer oder k?rperlicher Stress. Ein typisches Zeichen fr Nervosit?t sind sich st?ndig wiederholende Bet?tigungen (z.B. N?gelkauen). Auch Einschlafst?rungen sind h?ufig nerv?s bedingt. Daneben k?nnen noch andere k?rperliche Beschwerden auftreten, h?ufig kommt es z.B. zu Kopfschmerzen oder Magen- und Darmbeschwerden (Magen, nerv?ser). Depressive Verstimmungen fhren zu Antriebslosigkeit und k?rperlichen Beschwerden wie Magen-Darm-Probleme, Appetitlosigkeit, Mdigkeit oder Schlafst?rungen.              H?ufige Ursachen     Seelische Probleme wie Familienprobleme, berufliche Sorgen, Partnerverlust, Prfungsangst oder sehr harte geistige Arbeit.     berreizung durch zu langes, zu hartes Arbeiten. Zu langes Fernsehen.     Unregelm??ige Schlafenszeiten durch Schichtarbeit oder durch die Zeitverschiebung bei einer Fernreise.     Zu schweres Essen am Abend oder berm??iger Genuss von Alkohol oder coffeinhaltiger Getr?nke. Schlechte Schlafbedingungen wie L?rm, schlechte Luft.     Psychische Erkrankungen (z.B. Depressionen).     K?rperliche Erkrankungen (z.B. Schmerzen).     Nebenwirkung von Medikamenten (z.B. Appetitzgler).     Schlaftablettenmissbrauch.              Was Sie tun k?nnen     Am wichtigsten ist es, die Ursache fr die Schlafst?rungen herauszufinden und zu beseitigen.     Vor dem Schlafen k?rperlich entspannen z.B. ein warmes Bad (34-36C, am besten mit schlaff?rdernden Zus?tzen) nehmen oder ein Glas warme Milch trinken.     Gegen Nervosit?t kann autogenes Training helfen. Auch geistig entspannen, keine schwerwiegenden Probleme direkt vorm Zubettgehen diskutieren oder durchdenken.       Wenn man nicht schlafen kann, sollte man aufstehen und sich besch?ftigen (z.B. einen beruhigenden Tee kochen, lesen), bis man wieder mde ist.     ?ltere Menschen sollten nicht zu frh ins Bett gehen, auf den Mittagsschlaf verzichten und morgens frh aufstehen.     Tees, B?der oder Arzneimittel mit Baldrianwurzel, Melisse, Hopfen, Passionsblume wirken am Tage beruhigend und in der Nacht schlaff?rdernd. Insbesondere die Einschlafbereitschaft wird gef?rdert. Arzneimittel mit Johanniskraut k?nnen helfen, wenn eine depressive Stimmung Sie am Einschlafen hindert.     Auch ein Glas Wein oder Bier kann das Einschlafen f?rdern. Mehr Alkohol hingegen fhrt zu Schlafst?rungen.     Sind die pflanzlichen Pr?parate nicht ausreichend wirksam, k?nnen kurzfristig rezeptfreie Pr?parate z.B. mit Doxylamin, die Schlafst?rungen beheben.              Wann Sie zum Arzt mssen     Eine echte Schlafst?rung liegt vor, wenn das Problem mindestens 3 Wochen anh?lt und man sich am n?chsten Tag zerschlagen und ersch?pft fhlt.     Wenn noch andere psychische oder k?rperliche Beschwerden auftreten.              Was Ihr Arzt tun kann     Der Arzt kann mit Ihnen gemeinsam die Ursache fr Ihre Beschwerden herausfinden und eine innere Erkrankung als Ursache ausschlie?en.     Bei psychischen Problemen kann er Ihnen Therapievorschl?ge machen (z.B. Gespr?chstherapie, Arzneimittel mit Johanniskrautextrakten) oder Sie zu einem Spezialisten schicken.     ber die Anwendung von rezeptpflichtigen Schlafmitteln oder Pr?paraten gegen Angst, Unruhe und depressive Verstimmung informieren.              Vorbeugung     Fr optimale Schlafbedingungen sorgen: gute Ausstattung der Betten, gut gelftetes Schlafzimmer, nicht zu warme Raumtemperatur (nicht ber 18C), m?glichst Ruhe und Dunkelheit.     Regelm??ige Schlafenszeiten einhalten.     Tagsber fr gesunde Ern?hrung, ausreichend Bewegung und frische Luft sorgen.     Schwer verdauliche Speisen und Coffein am Abend meiden.     Keine schwere k?rperliche Arbeit oder Leistungssport vor dem Schlafengehen, weil Anstrengung den Kreislauf zun?chst einmal ankurbelt.     Vor dem Schlafengehen entspannen. Keine aufregenden Filme sehen oder sehr spannende Bcher lesen. Dies gilt besonders fr Kinder.     Bei Kindern ist es wichtig, jeden Abend die gleichen "Zubettgeh-Rituale" (z.B. Spieluhr aufziehen, Geschichtenvorlesen) durchzufhren.|`|9369bfdbd9af2a33f4ee222cd8c2e5e3aa	Vom Alkohol kann ich nur abraten, dadurch Narkotisiert man sich nur und man bekommt keinen erholsamen Schlaf!!!

AA11311184	The age doesn't really matter, what matters is to refocus on things near and far. If you'll neglect one or the other the muscles will become constrain in one direction for too long, and the natural fluxation which strengthen, elastifies, and encourage healthy blood flow is hindered. This will cause a rigidity in the both the muscle and the lens of the eye, which will make it increasingly likely you'll develop, in your case, myopia (near sightedness - can't see things far away), or hyperopia (can't see things up close) in the opposite situation.    You should relax your eyes by focusing on something distant every half hour, at a minimium, and this should be done through out the day, making sure to look both near and far.    Also make sure the brightness, glare, and contrast ration are adequete on the monitor. Have lights on to help with the looking around once in a while, and reduces comparitive glare. Also consider getting the for computer use designed specialty glasses. In short, poor monitors worsen strain, and most still don't come close to the physical ease on the eyes of standard paper, which still requires the looking away. Excessively avid readers from youth tend to develop myopia due to not enough eposure to things far off such as outdoors allow.    Also nutrition plays a key role (without which you'd be blind if not dead already). It has been found that destruction of the blood vessels due to improper diet, and eating habits will especially damage the small vessels in the eyes. This is one reason why diabetics, vascular diseased, and hyper/hypotensive persons are at risk for blindness.    Chewing food thoroughly has been found to help prevent this, as has eating the proper ratio of nutrients. Simple meal eaters are also less at risk than complex meal eaters. You still need variety, just generally at different meals from each other since each food requires a different disgestive agent to be produced by the mouth, in syiva, the stomach acid, and intestinal fluids.     With unmodified food, and without habital eating, the sense of smell is the most effective means to discovering what your body needs to replenish. For example, If that baked potato smells good, by itself, then eat it. Don't eat any mixtures which have anything you wouldn't want to eat right then by itself in any quanity. There's a reason why you don't want to eat things which don't smell or taste good by themselves, your sense receptors know them to be poison at the moment, and would throw off the delicate nutrient balance and risk disease as result.    So eat what brings vitality, and pleasure; just pleasure alone can be fooled with drugs, which food, chemically is, especially when modified - there's a reason why it's the FOOD and drug agency...

The doctor told me that focusing for 12 hours a day on a computer would be one thing, but I look up a lot and am talking on the phone or look across the room at someone or look up to talk to someone... regardless my eyes were focusing on something close and then far away which made them go bad.     I would suggest going to the eye doctor, perhaps it's more then reading glasses, or it could become more of a problem in the future. It is possible ( from what the doctor told me ) to fix/cure this problem if I do eye excercises. I am 23 years old and have been doing this for about the last 7 months and it seems to be working.|`|1182a7db76027396684dc5bbfb3bb134aa	You should get reading glasses. Its not good for your eyes if you have to squint your eyes to read. If you have good vision for the most part you probably don't have to get a prescription. You can get reading glasses that range from $10-$20 at many stores.

bd22411c441946b54544a59ee5f90faeaa	Pros:Why be vegetarian?        Improving Personal Health    It's no secret that compared to average meat-eaters, vegetarians generally live longer, are less likely to be overweight, suffer far fewer incidences of cancer and heart disease, and have more energy. These facts have been consistently borne out by decades of scientific research. The largest epidemiological study ever conducted (the China-Oxford-Cornell study) concluded that those eating the amount of animal foods in a typical American diet have seventeen times the death rate from heart disease, and, for women, five times the rate of breast cancer, than those who get 5% or less of their protein from animal foods. (See the references at the end of this article.)    Meat contains 14 times the amount of pesticides as plant foods, since pesticides get concentrated as they move up through the food chain, and since they're more easily stored in fatty tissues. In 1980, six years after the pesticide dieldrin was banned, the USDA destroyed two million packages of frozen turkey products contaminated with dieldrin. (And such contamination can routinely occur without detection.) In 1974, the FDA found dieldrin in 85% of all dairy products and 99.5% of the American people. The EPA discovered that the breast milk of vegetarian women contained far lower levels of pesticides than that of average Americans. A study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine found that "The highest levels of contamination in the breast milk of the vegetarians was lower than the lowest level of contamination(in) non-vegetarian women The mean vegetarian levels were only 1-2% as high as the average levels in the U.S."    Saving the Earth    All food animals consume several times more grain than they produce as meat. So several times as much land is needed to grow grain to feed animals, several times as much energy is used to harvest the grain and transport it, several times as much water is necessary, several times as much pesticides, etc. Worldwide petroleum reserves would be exhausted in 11 years if the rest of the world ate like the U.S. The least energy-efficient plant food is 10 times as efficient as the most efficient meat food. A nationwide switch to a pure vegetarian diet would allow us to cut our oil imports by 60%.    Over half of the water used in the U.S. is used to grow feed for livestock. It takes 100 times as much water to produce meat than to produce wheat. The water required to produce a day's diet for a typical American is 4,000 gallons. (It's 1,200 for vegetarians and 300 for vegans.) Compared to a vegan diet, three days of a typical American diet requires as much water as you use for showering all year (assuming you shower every day).    U.S. Livestock produce 250,000 pounds of waste per second -- 20 times as much as humans. A large feedlot produces as much waste as a large city, but without a sewage system. Animal waste washed into rivers and lakes causes increased nitrates, phosphates, ammonia, and bacteria, and decreases the oxygen content. This kills plant and animal life. The meat industry account for three times as much harmful organic waste as the rest of the industries in the U.S. combined.    It takes ten times as much land to produce food for an average American compared to a pure vegetarian. An acre of land can produce 20,000 pounds of potatoes, but only 165 pounds of beef. In the U.S., 260 million acres of forest have been destroyed for use as agricultural land to support our meat diet (over 1 acre per person). Since 1967, the rate of deforestation has been one acre every five seconds. For every acre cleared for urban development, seven acres are cleared to graze animals or grow feed for them.    Around 85% of topsoil loss is directly associated with raising livestock. We have lost 75% of our topsoil. The USDA says crop productivity is down 70% as a result of topsoil loss. It takes nature 500 years to build an inch of topsoil. Vegan diets make less than 5% of the demands on the soil as meat-based diets.    Caring for Animals    Around eight billion animals are killed for food every year in the U.S. alone -- a number greater than the entire human population of the planet. Each meat-eating American eats the equivalent of about 24 animals per year. What's worse, modern agricultural methods mean that animals are raised in cramped confinement operations instead of the pastures from childhood picture books -- a practice known as factory farming. Chickens are crammed into cages with no free space, and are debeaked to keep them from pecking each other to death. Animals are pumped full of various powerful drugs to kill diseases resulting from filthy living conditions, and to make them grow or produce faster than nature intended. When cows and chickens stop producing as much milk and eggs as the younger animals, they're unceremoniously slaughtered and made into low-grade meat (fast food and pet food). For some, vegetarianism and veganism are ways to refuse to participate in the commodification of animals.    MORE ENDURANCE  At Yale, Professor Irving Fisher designed a series of tests to compare the stamina and strength of meat-eaters against that of vegetarians. He selected men from three groups: meat-eating athletes, vegetarian athletes, and vegetarian sedentary subjects. Fisher reported the results of his study in the Yale Medical Journal.25 His findings do not seem to lend a great deal of credibility to the popular prejudices that hold meat to be a builder of strength.    "Of the three groups compared, the...flesh-eaters showed far less endurance than the abstainers (vegetarians), even when the latter were leading a sedentary life."26  Overall, the average score of the vegetarians was over double the average score of the meat-eaters, even though half of the vegetarians were sedentary people, while all of the meat-ea|`|4f4425182f2e005fcef32e825e16408baa	Pros - cleaner body, cleaner planet, cleaner spirit    Cons - sometimes difficult to find much of a selection at some restaurants; you may be the only one at a party and/or dinner and that can be a pain, knowing others have to worry about what you're gonna eat|`|e377bd09532c009bde62d32402688970aa	I was a vegetarian for one year then a vegan for two, now I'm a carnivore again and I've never felt better.

Not to mention the contribution of saving the Lives and hardships of factory animals, a vegetarian diet is far superb for our health. Animal fat is not good for us and clogs our arteries, plus we run the risk of getting EColi, mad cow disease, and numerous other diseases that spread from animals being in inhumane conditions to become part of the food chain. Read for reference John Robbins book "Diet for a New America" and "The Food Revolution", and look into Dr. Dean Ornish heart program.|`|dace4b34446533b003b93e70ff0e0a64aa	Pros:  It can save money, you can lose weight faster, and your chances of getting food poisoning are greatly diminished.  Some people also claim feeling healthier on a vegetarian diet.    Cons:  You can become anemic from not getting enough iron, you may not get enough protien (yes, there are veggies with protien, but meat is certainly the better way to go), and some people claim feeling very weak on a vegetarian diet.    In the end, it's what works for you.  I tried being a vegetarian, but I started passing out (even making sure I was eating all of the foods I should).  I saw my doctor and he said because my protien and iron levels were so low, I needed to start eating more red meat!!!  It didn't work for me, but it works for some.  I think all of us are different in the way our bodies work and absorp the things we need in our system.  Some people eat well their whole life and still have health problems while others eat crap and live to be 100.  My grandmother has been eating sausage, eggs, and biscuits with gravy for 95 years and her cholesterol levels are still perfect!!!|`|3af075fe069e2c7a3129718acb37dafbaa	The possible con is that you will not enjoy the taste of foods that do not contain animal porducts.  If that is not a con for you, then there are no cons.  The pros need some clarifications.  It cannot be assumed that a vegetatian diet will be healthy, afterall, one might only eat french fries, jalapeno poppers, and other such garbage, and that is not going to improve your overall condition.  However, a crap diet of meat products will be worse for you then a crap diet of vegetable products.  If you are choosing to become a vegetarian for philosophical reasons, there is no reason for you to raise this question.  If you are doing so for health reasons, then also consider *the additives in the foods you eat, the temperatures at which you cook your food, and the overall quality of the foods you are consuming.    While meat in general has negative aspects, those aspects can be mostly avoided by making good decisions with regard to the previously mentioned points to consider* for being a vegetarian.|`|a93896c9295c1f5144fcaa2f89366755aa	Cons: Less healthy becasue u don't get enough protein.

If you earn a billion dollars, to some you'll never make enough to be called successful; become an ambassador and there are those who will say you've not done enough to be considered successful; pursue any career and there will always be those who will not consider you successful.      There are as many standards of success as there are means of achieving it.  In the end, it is you who will decide what has made you successful.  It doesn't come from the amount of money you make or the things you amass, but how many lives you impact upon and improve.  We've become too much of a materialistic society and place value on things, and not people.    Your feeling distracted and depressed can be due to simple chronic exhaustion.  With all that you're doing, it's easy to forget to take time for adequate rest and mental diversion.  Taking a little time out to divert yourself is not wasting it but investing it.  If you don't recharge your mental batteries, sooner or later, your work is going to suffer, not to mention your outlook on life.    It will do you a lot of good to take a little time to inventory what your strong points are; your talents; the things that bring you satisfaction.  There's where your success lies.  Pursue those, and no matter what others may think of you, to those whose lives you enrich, you will be a success.

Another thing you should be aware of the boil is awful close to your sinus cavity and the infection could, if it hasn't already, spread into this cavity which will result in a more serious problem.

1186dcf9b910880f9b935d2af4109509aa	Dear, I just did a little look into your pages to see the kind of questions you ask, and the kind you answer.  Generally I see a strong trend that disturbs me.  You are obsessed with questions regarding anorexia and cutting.  You NEED to talk about these things.  You are on a suicidal path and you know it.  You need help.    You do not need validation for your question.  You know  full well that these things are not healthy activities.  You are obviously very troubled and potentially suicidal.  I am sure you come in to discuss these issues because you are becoming a tad worried about yourself.  Either that or you foolishly seek validation which of course you will not get.  IYou must be afraid and beginning to become desperate to ask such a q in this place.  We are all anonymous and cannot "bust" you.    Harming your body is of course not a great idea.  One of my daughters was a "cutter" when she was in her mid teens. It was not until she and a friend cut the goddess triple moon into each other's upper arm that I discovered the scars on her forearms.  This girl was, to all extents and purposes, a "winner" with high grades, potential scholarships, much beauty and personality, and a top athlete.  I could not believe my sunny charismatic daughter did this.    I contained my worries until I learned more about cutting.  She had piercings and a tat, so I could not figure out why she did this.  Body image and food were not a problem.  We sat and talked and finally got to the bottom of it.  It took a few pots of tea and a bowl  or two of pot, but we got to it.  In her case it went back to her father's abandonment of us.  Once she realized it was her way of dealing with her loss, she never did it again.  Fortunately, we are very close and have none of the usual communication difficulties so freqently present between mother and daughter.     She began to talk to the school counsellor. Alhamdullilah, she worked her way through her pain and is now taking a scholarship towards her Masters in Maths and Computers.  Since then she has gotten maybe eight new piercings and one tat.  Nothing on her face... whew!  But that is ok, we got the piercings together.  Yes Mom got a few too.  You CAN get past your pain but help is necessary.  You get so lost in your emotions you cannot see your way out of the mess you are in.    It sounds to me as if you have no adult figure, or even wise older sibling, in your life to speak to. You are screaming for help and it is imperative you are heard.  You would not be asking such questions in here if you were not starved for a forum in which to discuss these.  You are worried about your own behaviours. And rightly so.    You are attempting suicide in at least two fashions.  Does your family not see you not eating?  not notice you are skinnying down?I am sure your Mother would want to help you. Perhaps you could speak to a school counsellor and receive assistance.  If you are afraid of your parents' reaction, such exchanges between you and a counsellor are kept private.      No one is ever as alone as they think they are, no matter how deeply they believe they are!  I know this from personal experience.    Cutting your toes I have never heard of, but infection could easily result since feet are hardly the cleanest part of the body.  If they are not enclosed in steamy germy shoes, they are out in the air on the ground.  Not too good.  If you are run down from poor nutrition it is much easier to become serously effected.  Gangrene can result with even less encouragement.    Several years ago I had an illness that made me so thin everyone was worrying that I was Anorexic.  I won't go into details.  I wanted to eat and drink but could keep nothing down.  The doctors could find nothing wrong and started sending me to shrinks for anorexia.  Finally they listened to me and I got the necessary surgery.  But, it came within a day or so of my developing permanent heart and liver damage, and other internal organs.  Just in time.  I was lucky.    These internal organs tend to start shutting down at a certain point.  The damage is usually irreversible. So is it healthy... nope!  But you already know that, too.    You are obviously a troubled lass in need of professional care. What is bothering you that you feel is worth your life?  Use Yahoo to email me if you want and I would be happy to exchange talks with you.  You might find it helpful.      SO... put away the cutting tools and start taking better care of yourself.   We only get one body and it has to last for a whole life.  It is up to you to determine the length of that life.  Please realize that nothing is worth dieing for.  I have faced that demon myself as well.      You know the answers.  You come in desperately seeking contact with people and perhaps a clue to serve as a life raft.  Might I add, if you got past your problems, and got out into the world and took up a cause that takes you out of yourself you might feel better about yourself.  It often helps to do something that takes you out of yourself, perhaps pushes you a bit, to divert you and make you see others have problems as well.  Helping others is the ultimate cure for many types of depression.    I pray things improve for you.  Take up my invite to talk if you wish.  I have a good ear and you would not be the first youngster I have spoken with on these things.      I send you blessings.|`|DJvH0s2saa	yeh its healthy dawg keep it up try and do it with vinegar on the knife its better dawg|`|ElIECWogaa	yeh definitely homeboi  just film it then shuv the video up ur bum so then u can keep it 4ever  2 remind urself of all the healthy things u did in ur youth    keep it up dawg|`|fb408b674407c6efcc685cb640058f68aa	Let's be logical.

Chronic night sweats are indicative of a number of potentially serious conditions (chronic TB, endocarditis, HIV, some cancers, some endocrine disorders, etc). Could be medications or simple hyperhidrosis as well - let the doc work on it.

WMkBmHUyaa	If you feel bloated, you want to AVOID anything salty, because it will make you retain water and make you feel more bloated.  It's important to take in lots of liquid, particularly water.  I find if I drink too much liquid around a meal I can feel bloated.  So it may be best to drink mostly between meals.    Also, will you be having your period soon?  Lots of women bloat a week or two before their cycle.  I always do.  This is just hormonal and there isn't too much you can do about it.    Bloating is a common issue for me.  Here are some things that I find help:    1.  Drinking ginger tea.  Ginger helps you get rid of the gas.  You can buy ginger from the grocery store, peal it, put it through a garlic press or finely chop it up, and add it to hot water.  Voila!    2.  Light exercise, such as walking or massaging your tummy.    3.  Put a hot water bottle on your tummy.    4.  Eat slowly (you can swallow too much air if you eat quickly).    5.  Breathe through your nose, instead of your mouth (you can swallow more air this way).    If it keeps up and you still feel like you can't go to the bathroom, go see a doctor.  Good luck!|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	You may have increased your fiber which can make you feel bloated. Try drinking more water, but cut out carbonated drinks of all kinds. Also if your salt intake has increased (even sea salt has sodium) try Dexatrim water tablets or pills. Also, coffee. Believe it or not. Caffeine serves as a diuretic.|`|AA10470392	you must need the water, keep drinking tea and it will flush you out.  Iced tea makes me go a lot faster.  Not sure why just does.  Or try taking a water pill dexatrim (on occasion only) as a last resort...or it is probably that time of the month...it will do it to ya.  Stay away from salt..olives, olive oil...or added salt.  Also if you eat more vegies...broccoli....they create gas and cause bloating!  Before dexatrim try a gas-x it is alot safer.
AA10346736	Go see an OB-GYN and find out what is causing the elongated cycle.  There could be any number of reasons ... a tumor, pre-menopause, an infection, an irritation ...

Ever since about 2 years later I have been on a normal schedule.|`|M6HY7Zrsaa	Yes darling... listen to what the others are saying to you. You are not supposed to be "on" for that long. Find an obgyn pronto!|`|6e1096cfdd67603fc898286dcee04568aa	hi there~  I am a woman not only schooled in this situation, but experience problems myself. It is definately not normal for this to be happening.  Have you gone long periods without getting your cycle at all?  Are you on any type of birth control pill or any other? (not condoms)  I have had ovarian cysts that have cause irregular periods and I have also been diagnosed with cervical cancer twice that has made my cycle irregular.  Do you experience any pain other than typical cramps? The first thing you need to do is consult with a gynocologyst.  You definately need some blood work taken, and I would suggest an ultra-sound as well.  If you're not on the pill it will help regulate your cycle.  Because of my cancer issues I can't take any birth control items because they increase your risk of cancer.  My doctor had to put me on hormone pills because I was going months without it, then getting it for a day or two, then getting it again a couple weeks later for a couple days, then going months again without it.  Once again I went to school for nursing so I was taught all about this.  If you need to talk or ask more questions feel free to email me.  erin_glmr@yahoo.com  I hope I helped.|`|271b7c3941da18e241e98664fe3f2de4aa	See a doctor asap!!!!!

Although, if it truly was your heart, you'd increasingly have problems breathing and probably would get some pain down your left arm and possibly in the neck. It could also possibly be gallstones. For gallstones, the pain would be more on the right, under the right breast. If the squeezing pain continues and gets worse and your breathing becomes harder, please go to the emergency room. You can control the nausea by buying an over the counter emetic syrup called, "Emetrol". It's some basic sugars but it will stop your nausea for sure. Just don't drink anything 15 before or after a dose, as it shouldn't be diluted. What I don't get is the dizziness, unless the pain is putting pressure on your lungs and you're not getting enough oxygen, that would be one reason. If it is a sliding hiatal hernia (which just means that a bit of your stomach can be caught up in the diaphram), try standing up for about 20 or 25 minutes. The gravity might correct it. Good luck to you. And if it gets worse, please go see a Doctor! Take care.|`|AA10241958	Try http://www.webmd.com/. Get feeling better: Blueladybug

xdSz6uC6aa	No steroids? Fine. Then gain your **30 pounds of lean muscle** and pat yourself on the back when you reach that natural limit. Don't be ashamed if you never achieve this because most men can't even gain 15 pounds. It's a lot of work! Don't overtrain because that can damage muscle so always give yourself two days rest in a week and never train the same muscle the next day.    If you really want *more* than 30 pounds, you need to know that you just can't achieve this without steroids (I know, you don't want to hear that but it's true and you need to know this), which is why many people do them. It's not because they're lazy or stupid but because all humans have a **natural genetic limit**. Women have a much lower limit because they have less androgens than men.    Gaining more than 30 fat-free pounds is not naturally possible for a man no matter how strong you get or how well you eat. Many people will try to tell you that you can, but if you can't do it, then you know that I was right all along. If you can, then great! ... but not likely.    Plus, professional bodybuilders ALL take steroids, even the ones who claim they're "natural bodybuilders". Arnold Schwarzenagger admitted to taking steroids recently. He still became Governor of California. Bodybuilders lie because A) it's *illegal* in most countries to take them now unless they have an illness, and B) bodybuilders pretend to be natural "superhumans" to sell you products that won't work or to promote bad movies. Many bodybuild primarily for $$money$$, not necessarily for health or self-fulfillment. To do this, they have to inject many drugs (steroids, growth hormone, etc.) to keep very big.    So if you want to succeed in life, you gotta do the following:  - Decide for yourself what you want to achieve.  - Be *honest* to yourself about what you want.  - Be honest to yourself about what you will *not* do.  - Be honest to yourself about *why* you want it.  - Be honest to yourself about *why* you won't do certain things.  - Know that you look hot as you are.  - Know that *most* of your classmates don't think they look good.  - Know that many people are jealous of people with goals and self-confidence.  - Go to a library. Read everything on bodybuilding and bodybuilders.  - *Never* ask people on the internet! We're idiots. Ask a doctor or dietician!  - If anyone laughs at you, forget about those losers.  - Pat yourself on your back because you ask questions.  - People who are bold and ask questions are cooler than scared people without goals.|`|0dfde5bed81c3f7d176f4040974b4b24aa	its nothing bad to lift weights and if you are thats a good thing just dont carry more than you can hold up|`|e377bd09532c009bde62d32402688970aa	You're addicted to the results.

Allow plenty of rest for your muscles to grow.  You can do barbell curls all day everyday, but if you don't rest, you won't grow.  It's great that you are lifting though.  I also am "addicted" to results and lifting.  But as long as you don't let it get out of control, it's cool.  You are young yet, so like I said- it's a beautiful thing having plenty more years of excellent growth.  I also applaud you for your decision to stay away from steroids.  I am the same exact way.  Take care buddy.    -Alan-

You have alot to do with how long they will be on also. If you have a lot of breakage or if you don't wear your elastics properly, everything will take longer. Cooperation is they key! It didn't look like you had a lot of rotations, or space so it may not be too bad! Good luck! And make sure you * brush and floss* like crazy!|`|eRXoxf19aa	Well it all really depends how you progress monthly with them. They can give you an estimate, for instance they could say that you'll have them for a year and a half but maybe after you've had them on and you reach that deadline they could say that you might need them on for a just a little longer in order to finish straightning things out. When you have them on you also have to be very careful with the things you eat, avoid really hard foods you might take something out of place therefore affecting the whole process. Hope this helps!|`|AA11090251	Your teeth are very straight. Most people keep them on for 1-2 years but I would probably say that you would only have them 6-8 months, they are soo straight.

I have no clue how long but my doc said i  probly wouldnt have them off for grad|`|ND9ljP8aaa	It will really depend. Most people who suck their thumb, experience problems with over jetting and over bites. It looks to me from the picture, that your teeth do over jet a bit. Over jetting is where your teeth stick out towards the front, and over bites are where your front teeth are longer and protrude over the bottom teeth or bottom lip. People who suck their thumbs usually spend about 2-3 years in braces, but it also depends on crowding and occlusion (how your teeth fit together). An orthodontist would really be the only one able to give you an accurate answer to this question. Most orthodontist, offer FREE consultations, in which they will take pictures of your teeth from several different angles, inside and out. They will make a treatment plan, and explain what needs to be done, how long you will have to wear them, and the cost. Most also offer very helpful payment plans.    Hope this helps to answer your question.

Um als psychisch krank eingestuft zu werden, muss schon eine deutliche Beeintr?chtigung der eigenen Lebenqualit?t oder -f?higkeit, oder der der Mitmenschen vorliegen. Interessante Autoren, die sich mit diesem Themengebiet besch?ftigt haben sind meiner Meinung nach z.B. Erich Fromm (z.B."die Kunst des Lebens") und Arno Gruen (z.B."Der Fremde in uns"), die brigens   beide die Meinung vertreten, dass das gesellschaftliche/soziale Umfeld und unsere sonstige Lebenswirklichkeit in den westlichen Industrienationen eine gesunde geistige Entwicklung sehr erschwert bzw. behindert. Deshalb ist es allemal richtig und wichtig, sich im Sinne seiner eigenen geistigen Entwicklung damit zu besch?ftigen finde ich. Denn nichts ist endgltig und absolut und jeder hat die M?glichkeit, Dinge an sich zum Positiven zu ?ndern, nicht im Sinne vieler moderner Psychologen, Ratgeber etc.  um einfach leistungs- und funktionsf?higer zu werden, sondern im Sinne wahrer geistiger Gesundheit und Entwicklung, also im humanistischen Sinne.

68LcXmRVaa	Also. In der Humanmedizin spricht man zun?chst lieber von Antimykotikum als von Fungizid.  Es gibt verschiedenste Antimykotika, eben so wie es verschiedenste Pilze gibt.  Generell kann jedoch, wie auch bei Bakterien gesagt werden, dass nachdem die Selektion stark genug durch den Einsatz eines bestimmten Stoffes vorangetrieben wurde, eine Resistenz einsetzt.  Es stehen fr den Fall, dass eine ausreichende Indikation (mehrfacher Therapiefehlschlag oder extremer Pilzbefall v. a. der inneren Organe) vorliegt, aufwendige Reserve-Therapien (z.B. Ancotil? (Infusion) zur Verfgung, die zum Beispiel (wie bei Ancotil?) gezielt in das Erbgut des Pilzes eingreifen und gegen die eine Resistenz mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit ausgeschlossen werden kann.  Und um auf die erste Antwort einzugehen: Das ?tamtam? rentiert sich natrlich nicht fr jeden kleinen Hautpilz sondern nur fr handfeste, also bedrohliche bis lebensgef?hliche Mykosen.|`|d2ad0b005aa2bc30e29096ea659195b8aa	Ja, aber sie werden resistent und die Mittel hei?en Fungizide.|`|a9e2cfb38191a3755c1d279cf7f755f7aa	Ja kann passieren und stellt in der Medizin ein Problem dar.|`|b1fd4f813979f2f418f9acc06e2cd285aa	weil sie einen unfassbar starken berlebensdrang haben und die menschen ihr wachstum auch durch andere faktoren enorm begnstigen  oh,tats?chlich  entschuldige. ich hatte warum im kopf.  ja, sie werden.  das kann ich t?glich an den leuten merken, die verzweifelt von einem anti- pilz mittelchen zum anderen wechseln und nichts hilft l?nger als 4 wochen. wenn berhaupt.  alle dermatologen haben l?ngst aufgegeben....nur bei privatpatienten wird etwas mehr tamtam gemacht, aber eine wirksame "waffe" haben sie nicht anzubieten.|`|iKrg8nntaa	In Europa haben fakultativ-pathogene  Pilze eine zunehmende Bedeutung als Infektonserreger  bei immundefizienten Patienten.  Ihren Ausgangspunkt nehmen diese  Pilze aus der Umwelt, wo sie als Saprophyten  vorkommen oder von Schleimh?uten, die sie  als Kommensalen besiedeln.  Die Pathogenese dieser Pilzinfektionen  wird von erregerspezifischen Faktoren wie  auch St?rungen im angeborenen Immunsystem  des Wirtes bestimmt. Die relative Bedeutung  dieser Faktoren bei einer Pilzinfektion  ist jedoch noch weitgehend unklar.  In dem geplanten Schwerpunktprogramm  steht daher die Aufkl?rung von Infektionsmechanismen  bei Erkrankungen durch opportunistische  Pilze im Zentrum des Interesses.  Es sollen dabei verschiedene Teilaspekte  der Pilzinfektion  von der Kolonisation  bis zur Infektion  auf molekularer Ebene  untersucht werden. Die Genome wichtiger  Pilzarten sind bereits sequenziert oder  werden demn?chst fertig gestellt, sodass die  Voraussetzungen gegeben sind, die Infektionsmechanismen  von humanpathogenen  Pilzen auf breiter Basis zu analysieren.  Durch diese Untersuchungen sollen auch  Zielstrukturen identifiziert werden, mit deren  Hilfe eine Verbesserung der Diagnostik,  Therapie und Pr?vention von Mykosen  beim Menschen erreicht werden k?nnte.  Das Schwerpunktprogramm wendet sich  daher an Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler  aus Mikrobiologie und Zellbiologie  sowie klinisch arbeitende Gruppen, um die  Erfahrungen und Methoden in einem interdisziplin?ren  Ansatz zur Bearbeitung der anspruchsvollen  Fragestellungen zu nutzen.  Die Projektantr?ge sollen infektionsbiologische  Aspekte der vor allem in Europa  wichtigen Pilze der Gattungen Candida, Aspergillus,  Malassezia sowie Mikrosporidien  zum Inhalt haben und einem der  folgenden  Themenkreise zuzuordnen sein:   Metabolismus und Morphogenese  der humanpathogenen Pilze  Fr den Infektionsprozess bedeutsame  Stoffwechselleistungen und ihre Regulierung  sowie morphologische Ver?nderungen  werden untersucht.   Infektionsrelevante Eigenschaften  der Erreger  Potentielle Pathogenit?tsfaktoren sollen  auf Gen- und Proteinebene einschlie?lich  genomischer Methoden charakterisiert  und in Infektionsmodellen berprft werden.
QH7GEvhlaa	Kommt ganz auf die Konstitution, das Alter, etc.  und den sonstigen Umgang mit Zigaretten an.

Aber auch von Rauchern habe ich schon geh?rt, dass sie an einem Abend berm?ssig viel geraucht haben, so dass ihnen schlecht wurde. (Je nach Raucher 1 - 3 P?ckchen an einem Abend, b?h!)

Das Nikotin erzeugt sie in ihren Wurzeln. Wenn die Pflanze reift, wandert der Stoff in die Bl?tter. Nikotin ist eines der st?rksten Pflanzengifte. Die t?dliche Dosis fr den Menschen betr?gt nur 50 mg. Beim Rauchen wird das nicht erreicht, weil Nikotin im K?rper sehr schnell abgebaut wird.

Um sofort an Nikotinvergiftung zu sterben, muss man sich vermutlich 10 Zigaretten gleichzeitig in den Mund stecken und rauchen.

Jeder kann als psychisch gesund oder als psychisch krank betrachtet werden, in Abh?ngigkeit der Weltanschauungen der "Gesellschaft" (ich schlie?e die meisten Diagnosen von ICD10 F... aus).  Die psychisch kranken Menschen (nach meiner Meinung) sind eben diese, die mit den Schicksalsschl?ge nicht allein zurecht kommen k?nnen.   Bei den leichteren Diagnosen, muss man sein ganzes Willen mobilisieren (z.B. die Diagnosen nach ICD10F13), damit man nicht psychisch krank wird. Das kann schon vermieden werden.   Andererseits keiner weiss, wass in dem Kopf des anderen "schwebt", was er hinter sich hat, was er verkraften sollte.  Dier beste Weise nicht psychisch krank (nach der allgemeingltigen Formel) zu werden, ist schon bei dem ersten Zeichen von etwas Ungew?hnliches Hilfe (zuerst von Freunde, dann von Psychologen) zu suchen.

ENdTSySNaa	She could be anorexic, and may be, but I have known people who really felt uncomfortable eating in front of others...it happens.  Either way you probably seek the help of a counselor to figure out what you should do about finding her help if she is anorexic...I don't know if you are in school, if you are ask your guidance counselor for advice on how you should handle it.   He or she may even talk to the person for you...that way its stays anonymous so if it turns out she isn't anorexic then you aren't embarrassed every time you see her.  You could always just start a conversation with her or ask her friends if they have noticed that she doesn't eat.  If she is anorexic she is more likely to talk to her friends about it and will be more open to their help then that of an acquaintance.

I had them "bonded" so that each tooth looks a little bigger. I hated it at first, I thought it was ugly and I wanted my space back. My teeth looked HUGE and I was miserable. After a while, I got used to the change and really liked it. I'd look at picture of the old gap and think how horrible it looks.    Chances are, you'll like it after a while too. It weird because you have to talk, eat, and spit differently. It feels like a big hunk of gum in your teeth, but you'll get used to it.    As far as I know there there is no way to get rid of it. My dentist said it might fall off in a few years but they usually last more than 15.     The best advice I can offer you is to not try and whiten your teeth.

That's ok, most people (myself included) do not have a bench press that they should brag about.  Just keep on lifting and making more progress, that's what it's all about.    With respect to size, it looks like you increased your weight by 20 lbs.  Without seeing you, nobody could tell you what kind of progress you made.  In other words, how could I say you added 20lbs of muscle instead of 20lbs of fat?  The former would be really great progress, but the latter, anyone could do with enough KFC and Burger King.  You need to look in the mirror and be the judge for yourself whether or not you've gained quality size.
vx8GZzXDaa	An Eye Stye is a common infection of the hair follicle of an eyelash, resembling a sore similar to a boil or a pimple in the gland at the edge of the eyelid which leads to blockage of the hair follicles that may become swollen, nuisance and painful to the touch. An Eye stye occurs when staphylococcal bacteria infect one of the tiny glands at the base of the eyelid hairs and then becomes inflamed. An infection bacterium is frequently transferred from one hair shaft to another when rubbing it to relieve itching.Unless the swelling blocks vision, a stye do not affect vision and their symptoms include pain in the eye or in the eyelid, discomfort when blinking, sensitivity to light, swelling of the eyelid, blurred vision and redness or tearing of the eyelid. In most cases, a tiny pimple is present. An Eyes Stye develops in 3 to 7 days; usually fills with pus then burst spontaneously healing on their own when the infection drains. Pain and swelling subsides when the pressure is relieved.    This disease appears due to debilitated condition of the system. A diagnosis by a physician is not required but advisable because a chalazion can be mistaken for a stye. Chalazion is a non-bacterial lump on the eyelid caused by a blocked mucous gland under the eye. Your physician may examine your eyelid to determine the cause of the infection. This condition may also appear as result from blocking of the gland by dirt or due to error of refraction.    An Eye stye can be treated at home by applying very warm compresses for about ten minutes at each time, 3 to 4 times daily, using a wet, clean wash cloth to the tender area. This treatment will aid in the suppuration of the stye; suppuration refers to the forming of a head on an infection and the heat from compresses speeds up the white blood cells to fight the infection. Your physician may prescribe the applications of antibiotic drops or antibiotic cream for the stye. If you have frequent styes, the prescription of an antibiotic ointment will prevent the recurrence     Eye Stye Tips   As preventive measures, never put your fingers in your infected eye because your hands are full of germs, and allow the eyes styes rupture on its own. Never ever "pop" a stye like a pimple because it may cause the infection to spread or transfer from one eye to another. Many eye infections are contagious, and eye styes do require a high standard of hygiene. The best advise to no sharing of eyes-makeup, towels or face cloths is and during insertion and removal of contact lens be sure to use good hygiene practices.|`|AA10470392	Just wash your eyes well and do not use that eyeliner or mascara again, try something new.  But you can just get stye's randomly but a new and different kind of makeup would be best.  Maybe even dont wear makeup till its gone...or as minimal as possable.|`|cmYpjHSjaa	Sounds like a sty to me...  Have you tried warm compresses?  That sometimes helps.  There is also a medication that you can get at the drugstore.  It's like a gel that you put under your eyelid. (I know that is difficult  with an upper lid.)  If all else fails, see your eye doctor.  I once had three at the same time, and the doctor had to cut them out. But my case was extreme.  Your doctor may even give you some drops to put in the eye.    Don't worry.  It sounds scarier than it is.|`|64769c04ebbdd7b9f9da15a6295a155eaa	If you still have it after two weeks, I'd go to a doctor.  Also, throw ALL of your eye makeup away, buy new stuff and don't share it with anyone.  In the meantime, put a warm wet washcloth over that eye for 5-10 minutes 2-3 times a day.  This should help the swelling go down.

rPMFjeV8aa	Yes, you can make a weak solution out of a teabag and warm water. Black tea, like nestea or liptons, or even better, use loose black/brown tea. Then cool it down and drip it into your eyes. It is an astringent with mild antibacterial properties - it should make your eyes feel much better. Or you can try sea salt and water solution - this will also rinse out your eyes - but you need to make sure you are using PURE sea salt and not salt with fake additive stuff or iodine in it. You should also try to switch to hypoallergenic eyeliner and mascara at this time of year - the less irritating you makeup is during allergy season the better your eyes will feel when the allergies hit. If you wear contacts, make sure you buy saline solution for sensitive eyes (without thimerosol). Also, if you have any sudafed or claritin antihistamine pills ( you can get it over the counter at the drugstore) you should try them - it will help keep your allergic reaction under control (but make sure you dont have a bad reaction to these meds).|`|R5T6Lcbcaa	try not to wipe it or even scratch it... try to wash it with warm water.. or wipe with a clean cloth|`|eRXoxf19aa	Something that works out for me is using eyewash, if you don't have that you should rinse your eyes thoughroughly with warm water.

It is a great organization! I joined because I had the goal of running a marathon and I knew I needed a tremendous amount of help and support to meet that goal. In order to train with TNT you must commit to raising a certain amount of money. At first, this scared me a little. I had never fund raised before and I was nervous. TNT walks you through how to raise the funds and they are there for you every step of the way.  The biggest motivator for me was the fact that I was asking friends and family for money to go towards my fund-raising goal and I told everyone I know what I was doing: raising money for TNT and training for a marathon. SO -- once I started receiving money for my fund raising goal, I knew I HAD to train for this marathon and training everyday. After all, people were sending me money to help me reach my fund raising goal, I would never have forgiven myself if I did not finish the training and the marathon. It worked and I plan to run another marathon next year....    100% of all  the funds you raise go towards research for luekemia and lymphoma. It is a great cause and I am so glad I am a part of it!!!|`|AA10836483	that is so funny this is what I am looking for.  I dont even like running but I know it will get me in good shape.
GRiTvbHOaa	A tonsillolith (also called tonsil stone or calculi of the tonsil) is a piece (or more commonly, a cluster) of calcareous matter which forms in the rear of the mouth, in the crevasses (called "crypts") of the palatine tonsils (which are what most people commonly refer to as simply tonsils).    Tonsil stones, it is theorized, are the result of a combination of any of the following:        * food particles      * dead white blood cells (a.k.a. "leukocytes")      * oral bacteria, possibly from mouth breathing      * overactive salivary glands    They are described as having a pungent odor: Halitosis concentrated into a small solid object. Visually, they may resemble sesame seeds in color and texture.    Protruding tonsilloliths have the feel of a foreign object, lodged between the outside of wisdom teeth and the temporomandibular joint region of the fleshed jaw. They may be an especially uncomfortable nuisance, but are not often harmful.    Tonsilloliths or tonsil stones are calcifications that form in the crypts of the palatal tonsils. These calculi are composed of calcium salts either alone or in combination with other mineral salts, and are usually of small size - though there have been occasional reports of large tonsilloliths or calculi in peritonsillar locations.    Tonsilloliths are difficult to diagnose in the absence of clear manifestations, and often constitute casual findings of routine radiological studies.    These calculi are composed of calcium salts such as hydroxyapatite or calcium carbonate apatite, oxalates and other magnesium salts or containing ammonium radicals, and macroscopically appear white or yellowish in color. The mechanism by which these calculi form is subject to debate, though they appear to result from the accumulation of material retained within the crypts, along with the growth of bacteria and fungi such as Leptothrix buccalis  sometimes in association with persistent chronic purulent tonsillitis. In other words "Because saliva contains digestive enzymes, trapped food begins to break down. Particularly, the starch or carbohydrate part of the food melts away, leaving firmer, harder remains of food in the tonsils."    Alternative mechanisms have been proposed for calculi that are located in peritonsillar areas, such as the existence of ectopic tonsillar tissue, the formation of calculi secondary to salivary stasis within the minor salivary gland secretory ducts in these locations, or the calcification of abscessified accumulations.    onsilloliths occur more frequently in adults than in children. Symptoms are usually non-specific such as sore throat, chronic cough or otalgia. A foreign body sensation may also exist in the back of throat with recurrent foul breath (halitosis). Treatment is usually removal of concretions by curettage; larger lesions may require local excision.    Tonsilloliths tend to be present in young adolescents and can manifest with bad breath and swallowing pain accompanied by a foreign body sensation and  in some cases  reflex ear pain. The condition may also prove asymptomatic, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|`|HvWwjnLFaa	Listerine-salt water-peroxide all is good gargles and mouth wash, check with doctor and if they say they got to go, load up on ice cream and jello,the use is your voice box and that little hang in the back and middle of mouth or if not and the glands.|`|a8a60af0a457663701a55711d0effa79aa	yes i have had them and the only way to get rid of them is to have them taken out good luck

XiXFc2q4aa	I suspect as a newly married couple it will get better.  Can he not feel when he is getting ready to ***? He should learn to recognize that feeling and stop movement or pull out. It takes practice and lots of mind control to be able to stop at that moment cause the natural inclination is to go in harder. He can practice through masturbation by delaying his orgasm. Stop movement at that critical time just before orgasm, then start movement again then stop. It will make his orgasm more intense too when he finally lets it fly.|`|d01df34ea93a4c45e27ff7491f1bc10aaa	Sounds to me like you have the problem of his premature ejaculation habit.

After all, the male orgasm is so good that men will literally pay money to have an orgasm, where women wont. And money talks. You think your man is getting off too soon but the fact is YOU take a long time to have an orgasm.     Solution: Get your husband to give you oral sex and get you off before you have intercourse. Then when he cums it wont seem like he pre ejaculated and you will both feel good. This is a natural way to work around him.|`|2259b1cc1a0608fbdc95dced2bd8bf0daa	It's all mental.

Certain positions I would last a LOT longer especially with increased 4 play  2.  Frequency of sex would increase my time but not that much ti would go from 3 min to maybe 6  3.  Not worrying about my performance helped tremendously (if i felt as though I wasnt being graded    I can provide you with more insight if I knew more about the situation    But for him as I found out for me it was almost all mental.|`|c28926a6cecbb5eb235757c8d5e9ccf1aa	Independent scientific studies (Rutherford University), have proven that Last-Longer, increase your stamina, and give you the ability to totally satisfy your lover for longer, and cure you permanently... 9 of the 10 subjects were completely cured of the problem after a 6 month course.    Last Longer is-Non-hormonal herbal therapy.  -Acts locally on the sex organs.-Regulates process of ejaculation.-Acts through neuro-endocrine pathway.  -Acts on the high centers of emotion in the brain.  Medical treatment for premature ejaculation includes several options. Any serious primary medical condition (eg, angina) should be treated; for the purpose of the following discussion, the male is assumed to be healthy and premature ejaculation is assumed to be his only problem. In addition, any accompanying erection problem can be treated with various methods with excellent success (see Erectile Dysfunction) and thus, only passing reference is made to treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) that may accompany the premature ejaculation problem.        * Including the female partner as much as possible in the treatment and counseling sessions is important to achieve the best outcome.        * The first step for treatment of premature ejaculation is to relieve any underlying performance pressure on the male.              o Assuming that premature ejaculation occurs when intercourse is attempted, instruct the couple that intercourse should not be attempted until premature ejaculation is treated. The male may use manual stimulation, oral sex, or other means to satisfy the female partner in the meantime.              o If the male always experiences ejaculation with initial sexual excitement or early foreplay, this is a serious problem and probably indicates primary premature ejaculation (the history should reveal this), which then most likely requires treatment in conjunction with a mental health care professional. These more difficult cases should be screened out.         * The couple should then be instructed on sexual therapy, such as the stop-start or squeeze-pause technique popularized by Masters and Johnson.              o The female partner should slowly begin stimulation of the male and should stop as soon as he senses a feeling of excessive excitement that may lead to ejaculatory inevitability.              o Then, she should administer a firm compression of the penis just behind the glans, pressing mainly under the penis. This should be uncomfortable but not painful.              o Stimulation then should begin again after the male has a feeling that the ejaculation is no longer imminent.              o The process should be repeated and practiced at least 10 or more times.              o Gradually, most males find this technique helps decrease the impending inevitable need to ejaculate.              o After a period of practicing this method, the couple can sit facing each other, with the woman's legs crossing on top of the male's legs. She can stimulate him by manipulating his penis close to, then with friction against, her vulval area. Each time he senses excessive excitement, she can apply the squeeze and stop all stimulation until he calms down enough for the process to be repeated.              o Finally, coitus may be attempted, with the female partner in the superior position so that she may withdraw immediately and again apply a squeeze to remove his urge to climax.              o Most couples find this technique to be highly successful. It can also help the female partner to be more aroused and can shorten her time to climax because it constitutes a form of extended foreplay in many cases.         * Another therapeutic modality is the use of desensitizing cream for the male.               o In Korea and other areas of the Far East, SS Cream (a combination of 9 ingredients, mainly herbal) has been shown to desensitize the penis, decrease the vibratory threshold, and help men with premature ejaculation to significantly delay their ejaculatory response.              o Unfortunately, SS Cream is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but simple combinations of lidocaine cream or related topical anesthetic agents can be used with similar effects and they are safe as long as the patient has no history of allergy to the substance.         * If the male is relatively young and he can achieve another erection in a few minutes following an episode of premature ejaculation, he may find that his control is much better the second time.              o Some therapists advise young men to masturbate (or have their partner stimulate them rapidly to climax) 1-2 hours before sexual relations are planned.              o The interval for achieving a second climax often includes a much longer period of latency, and the male can usually exert better control in this setting.              o In an older man, such a strategy may be less effective because the older man may have difficulty achieving a second erection after his first rapid sexual release. If this occurs, it can damage his confidence and may result in secondary impotence.

e45099cdbcbdca48ecaa37a935442668aa	Fasting is actually reccommended as a once-a-week sort of thing. For one day a week, you should eat a small breakfast, and not eat anything for the rest of the day except a small snack around dinner time. You're also supposed to drink plenty of fluids (not anything with chemicals, however.). This will clear your body of toxins and leave you refreshed for the next week. It also helps prevent sickness.  Fasting for any longer can be hazardous to your daily life. Fainting, dizziness, nausea, and tiredness may occur. Once-a-week is the healthiest way to go. =)|`|AA11094078	You will not starve. You will not instantly become thin. Fasting is consuming only liquids. When the body does not have to deal with digesting solid food and getting rid of the waste that solid food creates, it can concentrate on getting rid of toxins. The most common reason to fast is to eliminate disease or from the body.         How much weight will I lose?     The main benefit offered by a fast, to those who wish to lose weight, is the speed of the weight loss. To see a person drop 30-to-40 pounds in a 30-day juice fast is to see a person totally transform his life. Self-esteem is given a boost and for the first time in their life, discipline becomes a lifestyle. The fast becomes a catalyst for a total life overhaul. People start dressing better, showing more confidence, becoming more organized, more dedicated in relationships and more at peace.     Initially, weight loss can be as high as three-to-four pounds per day, but as the fast continues, the average loss will be one pound-per-day. If you are juice fasting and not losing weight, the juice is supplying all the calories you need. You may have to cut down on the juices or alternate between water fasting and juice fasting if losing weight is part of your goal. The slower your metabolism is the slower the weight loss.    Try to stay focused on the healthy things you are doing to improve your life rather than being consumed with the number of pounds lost each day. Water retention can vary your weight five pounds so watching the scale can be frustrating. The best motivation to fast is for physical and spiritual health. Be patient; the fasting process is slow. Be thankful the toxins are leaving your body. Do not have unrealistic expectations. Give your body the time it needs to do the work of cleansing.    Fasting And Metabolism       The fear is that while fasting, the metabolism will slow down and afterward there will be more weight gained than before the fast. Initially, any calorie reduction will cause a lowering in the BMR or base metabolic rate. Cleansing will bring health that will increase metabolic performance and energy output. In other words, you will eat less and feel more energetic.     After fasting, the body is more efficient. Digestion is better due to a cleaner colon. The colon walls have been cleansed of impacted feces, allowing improved absorption of nutrients. The good news is that greater efficiency equals enhanced energy. Healthy people burn more calories. They also eat less because they are more active and feel better about themselves. They don't need food as a security blanket.     The greatest impact you can have on increasing your resting metabolism is exercise. After a workout, you can be sitting on the couch reading while burning calories, as the muscles are grabbing glucose from the blood to replace glycogen supplies. The key to weight loss is fewer calories and more exercise. A diet high in raw food provides fewer, low-density calories, and higher-fiber, more-filling foods.     Oh, by the way, a slower metabolism diminishes aging. A tortoise can live to 400 hundred years of age.|`|LZNlYxwfaa	You can fast for a half day which would keep you from getting to weak  the rest of the day or you can just fast from your favorite food for that day.that way you wo'nt have to completely eliminate food.|`|L2wLd0Neaa	Go to chimaenterprises.com, they have great natural weight loss programs.

H6rpQIIjaa	The fact that your ankle is swollen means that there is continuing inflammation there. It sounds like you've injured  one of the soft tissue supporting structures in your foot such as a ligament or tendon. If you can walk on your leg it's extremely unlikely that you've fractured it.    It's reassuring that you have full range of movement and can weight-bear fully. I'm afraid that (contrary to popular belief in which fractures are held to be the worst injuries) damage to ligaments and joints can take even longer to heal.     I suggest doing basic stretching exersizes regularly and warm up your ankle in the morning and whenever you plan to use your foot. Physical therapists also use something called a 'wobble board' - these look a bit like flying saucers or the planet Saturn and standing on them, trying to balance, helps to strengthen and re-orient the supporting structures of your ankle again. There are plenty of online physical therapy guides which may help you but the best therapy will of course be provided by physios themselves. Oral anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and diclofenac (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) are good for these types of injury and may reduce pain and swelling - however avoid this if you are asthmatic, take warfarin or suffer from gastric upset (they can cause ulcers and GI bleeds). Make sure you check with the pharmacist before buying these.    If you keep moving the ankle gently (nothing strenuous but not resting it completely either) the joint will heal over time but it may be several months before it feels completely better.    If, however, your ankle gets more painful or swollen or doesn't improve at all over the next few weeks I suggest you do see a doctor just to make sure there's not something else going on with your joint such as an infection or a form of arthritis. They may also be able to refer you to physical therapy or a sports medicine specialist if necessary.    Hope it gets better soon.    Dr C Klinger MA(Oxon), MB BS.|`|DAcNScYTaa	probably scar tissue, not swelling.  see a doc when you can.|`|lGj86HX5aa	Insurance or no insurance, go see a doctor.

Goto http://health.discovery.com/tools/calcul...     This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.     Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the     Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.    Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.     Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat(equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/    This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what youre eating and how much youre eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it wont matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight.     Step 5: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.     Step 6(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).     Good luck!!!|`|f67bf2f970cdc18b147c58680eff9190aa	This sounds ok..however not just eating special k. You need to get all your nutrients!! Don't over do it though-your body needs to rest...  You don't need to do that much excercise in 1 day-sounds like you maybe overdoing yourself.

If you exercise more than 20-40 minutes on 3-5 days per week, the extra exercise is useless.  It won't matter if you exercise like crazy because your just overexerting yourself and not really doing anything more than they amount of time I wrote above.

Your funny sensation in the nostrils are because the throat and the nostrils are connected.  So are your ears.  You have to be on medication  to stop this problem.  No surgery is required.  Most commonly known medication is Nexium.  It is taken once a day first thing in the morning to control the stomach acid.    There is another kind of tablet called Romesec.  It is usually in the strengh of 20mg.  Its generic name is Omeprazole.  This is not as strong as Nexium.  Besides this once a day medication, you have to take Debridat after the first and last meal of the day to smoothen the digestion.  However, I am not sure if you will need a prescription for this medication in your part of the world.  Consult your physician as soon as possible as it could lead to stomach ulcers or heartburn which is often mistaken for a heartattack.  Sometimes, vomitting of blood occurs.  To confirm that you are having a reflux, the doctor will usually do a gastro-intestinal scopy for you.  while you are sedated, a scope is inserted through your mouth to your stomach.  You will not feel any discomfort and the whole process is about 4 hours (including recover time for the anesthestics).  Common causes include alcohol intake and heavy meal before bedtime.|`|o8mC9fq6aa	They were likely burned by the acid and now are healing.  Give it another 48 hours.

You might have a food allergy or two and yes, the stuff formed when inflammation occurs inside...such as infection...can be excreted in the sweat...or more definitely in defecation...and when you sweat, that would irritate an already inflamed spot on you since sweat contains salt and whatnot.

N6AlMfJgaa	I have been a dental assistant for 10 years. I love it. I would say the pros are good pay, very interesting no patient is the same, If you do cosmetic work it is very rewarding seeing how happy the patients are when the work is finished.     Cons would be if you work for a dentist who isn't that nice. I have worked for a dentist who would get frustrated easily and take it out on me. Very rude and down right mean. But I have worked for fabulous dentists as well. The attitude of the dds is important, you work in very close proximity 40 hours a week.  Some things are gross. like if patients have dirty mouths but you get use to that. Also it can be very bloody. It may be hard to take at first but you do get use to that as well.    I love being a dental assistant. Also the schooling is only about a year.|`|L1JXfHutaa	I agree with a (the person above me) dental assis. is rewarding! I loved it I did it for 6 years, and loved it. Find a dentist with a great personality. You will be working hand and hand with them and it's important to have a good relationship with them! Me and the dentist I use to work for always had patients ask me how did I just know what he was going to do? After about 2 years I knew what the DDS was going to do in any situation so he never needed to ask me for something. So when he heard the patients ask me this he would answer by saying "It's like a dance, a perfected dance between two people". It was too the point that he would turn to me for his second opionion... Dental Assis. is a great field to be in as long as you can handle blood....lol cause there will be lot's of it! Good luck....

The clear ones may discolor a bit, but they are MUCH LESS noticeable than dark, shiny metal!     The clear kind are more expensive, but I got them when I had to wear braces, and I think they were completely worth it. In photographs of me, from back then, you can barely tell I have braces (you can see them, but your eye isn't drawn to them). However, in photographs of people with regular braces, that is the first thing your eye notices!|`|7fcdb00da7ca0721cf2ca1b1b33f7a92aa	Hi!     I got my braces February 14th 2007, and I just happened to get the clear colored ceramic ones!    The wire is silver, hence that it's wire.    The bracket, (the square looking thing on the tooth) is clear, I chose Pearl so it doesn't dye as quickly.    The rubberbands, that go around the bracket to keep the wire in place, is clear, or any color you want.   Again, I chose Pearl so it doesn't dye as quickly.    I advse you to chose Pearl if you get clear braces, they dye three time slower than if you were to get actual 'clear' braces. Don't worry, they give you that option because they're ceramics!    I hope this answered your question, and also clear braces do not hurt as much and are well, funner and easier to clean!    Good luck!  :)|`|KQP5Z0gVaa	The tiny brackets will have to be clear and I think that the rubber bands have to be clear.

pyBTKZHaaa	Differin works great. I first cleanse with Cetaphil, then I use Differin on my face.    First you'll break out pretty bad. DON'T STOP USING IT. This is what happens when you really clean all the dead skin and gunk off your face. After a few weeks, your face will be looking crystal clear. DON'T USE ANY ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS. When you're using Differin, absolutely do not use any products with drying chemicals like salicylic acid.|`|eRXoxf19aa	I've tried out Differin and it works great. I use it once a day, so every night I wash my face with Clearasil and afterwards I put a bit of Differin, if I need to, and it really works fast. I really recommend it! By the way I really think that what you're planning on doing will help just be sure not to put too many stuff on your face, it might cause skin irritations and such. Oh yeah, I recommend you only use it at night if you expose your skin to the sun while you have that on it might overdry your skin. Hope this helps!|`|AA10356869	It can make your skin VERY dry.  DO NOT go into the sun while using if you don't have at least 45spf on.      If you start experiencing flaking, stop using it for a few days.  It is something that you have to build up a tolerance for.  If you skin is too dry you will have a surge of oil and break out.

A depress?o costuma ocorrer secundariamente, ou seja, n?o faz parte da doen?a em si, mas decorre dela porque a pessoa come?a a se sentir dependente para realizar atividades que antes realizava sozinha. Isto  psicologicamente pior para as mulheres, na maioria das vezes as "cuidadoras" da Famlia e que, de repente, se vem na situa??o de "cuidadas".     Deixe-a, dentro do possvel, realizar suas tarefas dirias, porm sempre com o cuidado de ter algum junto para auxili-la,principalmente na cozinha; a dificuldade em segurar objetos mais pesados pode ocasionar queimaduras.    Ajuda tambm, n?o s para o mal de Parkinson, que ela desenvolva atividades motoras (croch, tric?, bordado) ou que "puxem" pela memria (palavras cruzadas), se ela gostar. Tais atividades poderiam evitar que sua mente progressivamente se deteriore, o que poderia agravar o Mal ou causar outros distrbios degenerativos do idoso.    Mas, muito importante MESMO,  o carinho que vc tem por ela. Demonstre-o sempre: isto sim  muito importante para que ela se sinta til, feliz e n?o entre em depress?o.    Que tal,pedir e ajud-la a fazer "aquele" quitute, que s ela sabe e vc adora? Vai, com certeza, deix-la feliz e melhor.

6f96c2f993d25c5298a78d5ed6db78fcaa	Do you want to grow any taller - 6ft is perfect so you've no need to worry about that.    As for the facial hair - I wouldnt worry about it, my (ex) partner is 27 and he couldnt grow a beard even now - he gets a bit of a mustache and a bit on his chin but nothing really happens around his cheeks, his facial hair is very sparce and he doesnt have any hair on his chest or back either - just hairy legs and hairy pits and its fine.    I think you fella's tend to get hairier as you get older.    Don't worry - the hair thing happens as you get older and also, beards are soooooooooo last season!!!  :-)|`|AA10344749	well in all reality your body never stops changing even after your penis stops growing ( 15-21) and you get all your facial hairs you have a growth sper every seven years.  and then you get older and you start to shrink.    You will know when you stop growing because you will reach a point where there is no change to your body in growth.

qfSKgxDsaa	You probably should go to the doctor and make sure it's not broken.  If not, you need to probably where a brace/splint.  You can take tylenol and advil as needed for pain.  If it's bad then do tylenol (1,000 mg) then two hours later 2 advil then two hours later do tylenol again like that so that you are taking advil and tylenol every four hours but take something for pain every 2.  It's okay to do this b/c it's different pain relievers.  Don't take more than 4,000 mg of tylenol in 24 hours and not more than 12 advil's in 24 hours.  If this doesn't cut it, ask the dr. for something stronger.|`|qHMBkLx2aa	Go see a doctor. You have have some muscle damage.

DlL98tVHaa	suppressed emotions get stored in the muscles and manifest as tension after a while. and whenever someone pushes the pain button, a burst out can happen or you suppress even more and the tension increases. some people even develop sicknesses because of this.    be true to yourself, be aware of your thoughts, because thoughts are the cause of emotions.    do some inquiry into your thoughts to release stored emotions and become the light and aware being that you are (without all the debris of mind irritation).    http://www.thework.com|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Yup.

When experiences in life are not dealt with, whether it is because a person chooses not to deal with them or if a person just cannot deal with them, and emotions are pushed down and repressed, these emotions will remain in the cells of the body.

yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!

sw2R5A9iaa	so now you know -this is the first & most important step.  take a CPR class, read labels 3 times each, carry the epi pen & liquid benedryl at all times (and know her current benedryl dose), have all caregivers educated & certified, stay in constant contact with the school, empower your child & teach her about her allergy.  follow up with the allergist & pulmonologist often (she may have asthma, too).  ask the allergist for a referral to a parent support group in your area or start one.  go to FAAN online.  modify the diet of all family members to protect your child & relax -she can lead a normal healthy life.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	While it is new for you, remember there are many parents out their dealing with the same thing every day.      While my kids were learning, I had them wear a little tag (on the back of the shirt where the teacher could see) with their allergies.  At 3 all 3 of my kids could question any and all foods.  Even though we ate similar looking foods (soybean butter instead of peanut butter for example) I made sure to call it by a different name and taught them that some foods looked like it so always ask.  Teach her proper hygiene for keeping the allergen off of her skin and all the ins and outs of her particular situation.  Teach her how to use her meds and when to use them.  Educate, educate, educate.    The most important thing is to not go "psycho" on her.  I constantly run into parents of peanut allergic who think their allergy is the worst so everyone needs to ban peanuts.  I then run into parents of wheat allergic (air born too) who think their allergy is the worst so everyone needs to ban wheat.  It continues...  Kids had allergies before our kids.  Kids will have allergies after our kids.  We cannot expect our whole city to ban the foods to which our kids are allergic.  We need to teach them how to exist safely in a public environment.|`|RD1uEbGWaa	Our school is a completely peanut-free zone.  No peanuts are allowed in the building at all.  Children bring their own lunches, but parents are notified before enrollment that they can contain no peanut products.  We also have signs posted on each classroom door to remind parents of the policy.  (We do have a child with a life-threatening peanut allergy.)|`|d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	Awww...I'm almost 21 and I feel your pain to an extent. You need to have a "chat" with this daycare.    Stay strong, and know that your doing all you can to protect here.     You need to take her to an allergist, and get here tested for her allergies. She may need an epi pen.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Versantly's answer was perfect.  I can't imagine who gave it a thumbs down.    A few things I'd have to add...      A peanut free school is insane.  Really it is.  I fully understand the risks one has with food allergies, but education is the key.  My son is allergic to milk and egg.  He's still not keen on meat yet, so one of our main sources of protein and fat is peanut butter.  I wouldn't expect a school to ban all products that contain milk and egg.  That would wipe out a huge number of foods.    As for your daycare, I'd have a talk with the director.  Ask her if they can at least take the time to educate all existing and future staff about food allergies, administering the epi-pen, etc.  Suggest a policy of checking for food allergies before giving ANY kid any food or snacks (this will help with any future kids with allergies too. They are on the rise)    As for the freaking out... try to remain calm.  Yes, it is true that they can be life threatening.  But every body is different.  So far, the only reaction my son has had is severe vomiting.  It's not fun, but it could be worse.    this site offers some good tips.  http://www.faastcincy.org/living_with/ba...|`|xLO5VRYTaa	Peanutbutter may also make her sick. Don't let her eat it!

Take some advil or tums and your stomach should feel better.  Just try to drink plenty of water and eat right.  You may not always get cramps.  Sometimes I even get back aches, my hips will be sore, or I might feel really fatigued or irritable.

I can eat anything I want but everything has a ponits value, so triple chocolate cake will wipe you out on points whereas a cup of califlower sprinkled with butter buds and a slice of tomato with a veggie burger between 2 slices of weiht watchers bread will only set you back 4 points. I have two books. One has a points value for almost every food you can think of. The other book has ponints values for food at hundreds of restaurants all over the country. Your points are assigned to you by how much you weigh. The more yopu way the more points you are allowed to have, but as you loose weight, and you will loose weight, your assigned daily points go down a little bit. I have been on weight watchers for 3 months and it is the best thing I have ever tried. Exercise will put points back in the bank for you. Attend the meetings for motivation!|`|d66456de08a63c0838a382b8daf1e801aa	your points depend on how much you weigh.

Please see the following links for details:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/100...  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/colon-c...    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get an online, desktop, or cell phone diet and fitness calculator. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     Here are two articles on how to break through a weight loss plateau:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/86/...  http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/18/10...    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

AA10744085	As long as you take a quality supplement & are working out, no reason NOT to take one.|`|ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	Got you covered, my friend -- what you need is a good diet and exercise program first.  Just in case you don't have that, go to the Mens Health website (http://www.menshealth.com/) and click on the "Discussions" link.  There are forums there where you can ask questions about diet and fitness, and they have all kinds of good information on there like "clean eating" and "home grown muscle workout."  If you're going to take supplements, you only need two -- whey protein and creatine.  You want 100% pure stuff, and you don't need to get any fancy creatine (the plain old creatine monohydrate powder is fine).  Make sure the whey protein has at least 20 grams of protein in each scoop, and the creatine should absolutely NOT have any additives, especially not sugar/lactose/glucose/fructose, etc.  Don't get the stuff from GNC -- they're overpriced and don't have good quality stuff.  Try this web site:  http://www.supplementkings.com/    P.S.:  Don't worry about these supplements stunting your growth -- they have been tried and tested and are 100% safe as long as you follow the directions.|`|bcd51438325d4c7fc768ee68c85f4b9baa	If you take supplements now you'll never grow to see 5"8 in your life.

6NA2MXNPaa	Going through drug withdrawals is tough. It sucks. It can last anywhere from 3-7 days. Depending on how much she was doing and if she was truly only doing it for 2 weeks, she could have seizures from the withdrawals. And, yes, she could die. But, if she really only did it for 2 weeks, I don't think the withdrawals would be that severe. Her body hasn't had enough time to become totally dependent on the cocaine. I'm surprised she's having any withdrawals at all to be honest with you. Are you sure she's telling you the truth about how long she's been doing it? Or maybe she just happens to have a flu at the same time that she quit doing the drugs. She needs to stay hydrated. If she gets dehydrated she could become very ill! If she continues to vomit and can't keep anything down, then she should go to the doctor. If at any point things don't seem right, get her to the doctor, otherwise, she should be fine in a couple of days. Good luck! Glad she's off the drugs!    **If she has a history of doing it where she had to go to rehab to get off of it, then going on a binge for 2 weeks would be enough to cause severe withdrawals again. The addiction is always there, and every time you feed it, it gets worse and requires more drugs every time. She should get off it once and for all, she's just setting herself up to be a life long addict, and trust me, she doesn't want that. Tell her to dump the loser bf!|`|nbn0OXplaa	A 2 week addiction is really not yet a physical addiction. If she stops now or even in a month she will not die. the puking is probably a lie, unless you have actually seen her puke. An addict will tell you anything to get your sympathy and understanding that they cannot just stop using. Cocaine is expensive so when she has burnt through her money if by that time she hasn't already quit, just be there to pick her back up.|`|7jDyJRLyaa	She's not going to die from withdrawals, but she feels like she's going to.

If you have a radical hysterectomy, which includes removing ovaries, you go through an immediate menopause as all your hormones are cut off.

The good news is, no periods!!|`|73e47ce81b818b107ccb331b5ee0ff7baa	Hysterectomy's can put you into early menopause. I hate to say it but I had to have one so I can tell you from experience.    If you have a full hysterectomy, which includes removing ovaries, because your body goes into shock more or less the hormones put you into menopause. It is a big adjustment. I suggest a partial if you can and leave part of the ovaries. My friends that had the surgery with there ovaries in tact done so much better.  If you have a partial hysterectomy they continue to produce hormones and you have a normal menopause just without the crazy bleeding your body just experiences the hot flashes and mood swings. You can look up more on yahoo health. If you are the one having the hysterectomy good luck and the good thing is no more periods.

df4542f065da1b3e96153559da58208daa	Take what?  Can I recommend something?  If your serious bout losing lots of weight quick this has worked for me.  I gained 30lbs of fat from being pregnant.. I couldnt lose it for months.  I was tired of wearing maternities well after being pregnant.  I wanted to fit into my clothes again so I went to GNC and purchased "Hydroxycut Hardcore"  this suppress your apetite so eat "Lean Cuisines",  and if you DRINK lots of water and do 30-40 mins of cardio daily plus sit in the sauna for atleast 10mins daily.  You will dramatic results.. start lifting weights but dont lift slowly do it at a moderate pace... do 15 reps per set for each muscle upper and lower body.. Weight lifting does help burn calories.. Watch your calorie intake too!  Stop drinking sodas and high calorie drinks.. do this for at least 2 wks.. and you'll see some change.. You keep this up after 3 wks you'll be burning calories faster.. Remember 3,500 calories equals one pound.  And try not to weigh yourself soo much.. You will retain water if your a female and that is normal.. but continue to drink water even if you feel bloated.  TRUST ME this works after 4wks of this ppl saw results and were amazed how fast i dropped lbs.. i lost 26lbs in 5-6 wks.. when you reached your goal keep exercising you can take yourself off the diet pill just watch how much you eat and you'll be fine.. If you smoke i advise to quit, it will make things hard on you.  When you exercise becareful do WHAT YOU CAN... but try not to give in easily.. i had times where i didnt want to run.. and i kept imagining myself jumping off the treadmill.. i just kept telling myself that i wanted to fit in my jeans i want to wear shorts and cute skirts.. Reading Oxygen, SELF and other fitness magazines helped keep me motivated.. I am taking a break right now for the past 2 wks and i kept taking my pill ive maintained my weight.. im getting ready to drop another 12-15lbs of fat and turn into muscle.  Also take a vitamin supplement cause taking this diet pill, will deplete your body of certain vitamins that you need.. and you wont get much from eating low calorie foods such as the lean cuisines.|`|AA11667641	It took me approx. 12 months to lose 144 lbs. I cut out bread, patsa, chips, fries, everything fried. Lived on Veggies, fresh fruit, chicken ~no redmeat. Started walking and finally up to 6 miles a day. It is a long hard road that is a daily battle. Good Luck to you.|`|d5baf34e65bccce9569de81d9e95fe02aa	Generally, a safe diet is one where you lose a pound and a quarter a week. If you have 100 pounds to shed, it is best to consult a physician who can set up a weight loss programme to lose the weight faster. I would give it about a year.|`|AA10991881	Considering it is only safe to loose 2 pounds a week, about 50 weeks. About a year. Only 3 weeks short of a year. Try the South Beach Diet.

AA11397626	In searching, I found information that illness from malaria becomes actually more common during pregnancy due to depression of the immune system, it is often more severe and can cause birth complications.      I know about malaria but not about malaria during pregnancy, but this website seems to have a lot of useful information:  http://www.malariasite.com/malaria/Pregn...    Hope it helps!

The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get an online, desktop, or cell phone diet and fitness calculator. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     Here are two articles on how to break through a weight loss plateau:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/86/...  http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/18/10...    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...

UZxeBrxQaa	You WILL catch it eventually.  That virus is contageous, and can be spread even when there is no outbreak.    You are young.  Find someone uninfected.      Use a little finesse when you break up.  Tell him he is "unclean" and your body is a temple.  Or words to that effect.    If he really likes you, he can take a maintenance antiviral, like acyclovir, and diminish the chances of your eventual infection.|`|zFpHpqiLaa	**** that i would leave his *** he got herpes that's nasty u don't wanna get it u gotta dump him|`|SkRJNhuCaa	If he doesn't want to get it treated, he obviously doesn't care about you.|`|7fl1T1k5aa	he has it! youll get it! see a doctor and ask  youll definitely get it though  please please dont kiss him|`|96ndKQncaa	dont take this the wrong way. but thats a little weird like woah!  he says you probally wont get it because he wants you to kiss him/ please him and never leave haha!  speak to your GP  i wouldnt exactly take your bfs word on it If i was you  seeing as you havent stated if hes a doctor and stuff  LOL|`|fk9AvB25aa	Oral herpes can be passed by kissing and if he gives you oral sex when he has an out break. If he doesn't care about you then he wouldn't have told you that he has oral herpes.  NEVER let him kiss you or go down on you when he has an out break. Herpes is more contagious when there is an out break. There is a very small chance of getting oral herpes when there are NO signs of an out break.  Don't take his word that you won't get it, just take some precautions and there is a chance that you won't get it. You can be exposed to some thing and never get it. Oral herpes are common to have, 50-80 percent of the population has them, it's what can cause cold sores. I have them too.|`|DDmW1Yf3aa	i mean if its only been a couple months its truly not worth being with them, then having that for the rest of your life but if you know for a fact its a long time deal then love him for it and just accept it don't kiss him when he has a cold sore or when he feels one coming, just be extra careful and you can prevent it

887fd3eb26a1d83ce9480fd990e1527daa	I don't know for sure, but I've heard of different cultures that sew them up at a certain age.  Not sure if it is to make it tighter after childbirth or if it is to be sure they are not having intercourse.  I know that they do this as the young girls reach puberty.  It is a male dominent thing.

AA10533955	Yep.  Several years ago i got really sick and i started throwing up like every ten minutes on the dot.  My roomates took me to the emergency room cause i wouldnt stop and i had nothing left in me to throw up.   Once in the emergency room, they gave me an i.v. for fluids and something for the nausea.  After a couple of hours i thought i was fine and proceeded to go home.  They wheeled me out of the hospital towards the car in the wheelchair and all of a sudden i threw up again and the force to throw up actually forced some poop out and i had to go back into the emergency room.  I ended up spending three days in the hospital and i'm still not exactly sure what was wrong with me.|`|3c9f4e48ba2acda87b7ffffb8f58fa70aa	nope and I don't plan on it either.
9b43da856d0f38affa6f050bd9747d4aaa	It doesnt matter anymore as the way they test now is different..few years ago the lab wasnt able to do accurate test if there was presence of blood in the swab now as far as i know they are able to do test without being affected .I have been reading a lot questions here tnite relating to sexual health its pretty scary to see that every question relating to unusal smell discharge gets riddne off as a yest infection get med from drugstore etc. Y dont you tell your daughter to have an STD screen test while shes getting her pap smear..its just 2 extra swabs that take same time..lots of ppl think that by getting pap smears done theyget checked for everything but a pap smear is just for any signs of cervical abnormalities|`|AA10991881	I think that you should rescedual.

I personally would prefer to stick to this rule as it has been set up by the BC Cancer Centre and they must have a good reason for that.|`|a429d5df2b78e5868b6e755fae8085c8aa	i think its just easier to do one when a womans not on her period. if her gynos busy and doesnt think her period will affect the resualts then he/she probably doesnt see any reason to reschedule.
5530aa8b1ca5a1e6d5c18472ec2a3666aa	The main things that help me with pre-period grouchiness are exercising, getting as much sleep as I can, and taking evening primrose oil.  Try to exercise at least 30 minutes a day.  Yoga is the best for relieving period pain as well as helping you to feel calmer.  Evening primrose oil comes in gel-caps, you can find it at the health food store.  I take two caps every 4 hours or so, and it makes me feel less irritable, and helps with cramps.  It took me years to figure out the best things to do to deal with my period.  Pamprin and Midol always made me sleepy and feeling dehydrated, but evening primrose oil is all-natural and has no side effects.|`|AA10991881	If you are having that bad of periods go on the pill.|`|a7048783fbc60d384d1692d00e9d47d6aa	I suggest using female sanitary products.

RY1xuwzoaa	It's harmless as long as they get it out in the next 24 hours or so, don't worry too much about it.  After that, of course, it can become painful and infected...    I was at a Jackyl concert (I won front row tickets from the radio back in like 1991) and was right in front of the speakers.  It was soooooo loud that I took two (clean, unsmoked) cigarette butts and plugged the cotton parts in my ears so it wouldn't hurt.    Needless to say, I got pretty drunk that night too and woke up the next morning deaf in one ear.    Needless to say, it was embarassing going to the doctor hungover and having him fish a cigarette butt out of my ear!!!    Needless to say, haha, your kid is learning his lesson at six.   I was 22!!!!    Good luck :P|`|U37fBHvLaa	Just go to your nearest A&E and your doctor will refer you to ENT :)    Good luck :)     x|`|TmY4MPTuaa	Apparently you need another doctor for your child.

f245c3649e208f76e2df934a4fd4cbcdaa	Most home pregnancy tests claim to be "GREATER THAN 99 PERCENT ACCURATE" and imply that you can use them as early as the day you miss your period, but a study published in 2004 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology has shown that this is misleading.   The fact is that the amount of hCG in the urine on any given day after implantation can vary a great deal from one woman to another.  Laurence Cole and other researchers at the University of New Mexico evaluated 18 currently available tests and found that only one was consistently sensitive enough to detect the levels of hCG that most pregnant women were likely to have on the first day of their missed menstrual period.   Most of the other tests were only sensitive enough to pick up about 16 percent of pregnancies at that point, though many were likely to be accurate a WEEK AFTER AN EXPECTED PERIOD was due.   Hope this help. Good day.|`|AA10046040	Yes, it is possible to not have enough HCG to turn a pregnancy test positive, digital or otherwise.  If you really want to know for sure, go to your doctor and ask for a Beta Quantitative Analysis blood test.  It will tell if you are pregnant and approximately how far along you are.|`|ab9d078b2b4a36a5f06ec349e986f00daa	Perhaps you did not wait long enough after your first missed period.

Best of luck.|`|7684a7ed9de7f8216af5dd5ef8524cffaa	If it turns out not to be ulcers (which can come back), then get yourself checked out for yeast (Candida), as it can do some nasty stuff.    Other conditions that may have some impact are gluten intolerance (wheat, rye, barley and oats) or high insulin (hyperinsulinemia).|`|8a3ff9805e12eec0e520c691d8147b78aa	It could by you might be pregant or your peiord  is coming or you need to see a doctor|`|AA12188624	AWESOME! finally some one else has the same problem. i have also had the same pains when i was little. i don't have them much anymore. i thought it was an ulcer so i went to the doctor and they gave me some antibiotics. they went away. it was great! but a year later, they came back but not as bad. i just dealt with it. and now about 4 years later. it became excruciating and i had to go to the emergency room b/c the pain had spread to my back and it was almost unbearable. and i found out i had gastritis. and they gave me antibiotics for that and now i am better.       so, it could be one of those or in one of those categories. good luck.
df4542f065da1b3e96153559da58208daa	There are four common forms of athlete's foot. Common symptoms include persistent itching of the skin on the sole of the foot or between the toes (often the fourth and fifth toes). As the infection progresses, the skin grows soft and the center of the infection becomes inflamed and sensitive to the touch. Gradually, the edges of the infected area become milky white and the skin begins to peel. A slight watery discharge also may be present.     In ulcerative athlete's foot, the peeling skin worsens and large cracks develop in the skin, making the patient susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. The infection can be transmitted to other parts of the body by scratching, or contamination of clothing or bedding.     The third type of tinea pedis is often called "moccasin foot." In this type, a red rash spreads across the lower portion of the foot in the pattern of a moccasin. The skin in this region gradually becomes dense, white, and scaly.     The fourth form of tinea pedis is inflammatory or vesicular, in which a series of raised bumps or ridges develops under the skin on the bottom of the foot, typically in the region of the metatarsal heads. Itching is intense and less skin peeling occurs.     Only for sure cure is to go get it treated the meds at the pharmacy doctor prescribed work better they are stronger.. Over the counter sometimes works but it depends on how bad your fungus is.  Pasting vasoline on your feet just feeds the fungus.. keep your feet dry i know its hard with the fungus making your feet scaly anyways.. JUST GO TO THE DOCS office..|`|bc798e4c78f09343af08fdabe43d647faa	It sounds like eczema to me.  That is what my fiancee has anyways.  Your symptoms sound identical to hers, particularly the part about the ineffectiveness of the lotion treatment.

I would get some and if that doesn't help go to your doctor.|`|AA10746164	What is athlete's foot?  Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that causes a rash on the skin of the foot. It is the most common fungal skin infection.     There are three main types of athlete's foot. Each type affects different parts of the foot, looks different, and may be treated differently. While some people who have athlete's foot do not notice it, others develop severe symptoms.     What causes athlete's foot?  Athletes foot is caused by a fungus. Fungi commonly grow on or in the top layer of human skin and may or may not cause infections. Fungi grow best in warm, moist areas, such as the area between the toes.     Athlete's foot is easily spread (contagious)you can get it by touching the affected area of a person who has it. More commonly, you pick up the fungi by going barefoot in shared areas, such as swimming pools or locker rooms. The fungi then grow in the warm and moist environment of your footwear, especially if it is tight so that little air can move around your feet.    Some people are more likely to develop athlete's foot (susceptible) than others. Experts don't know why this is. Once you have had athlete's foot, you are more likely to get it again.     If you come in contact with the fungi that cause athlete's foot, you can spread the fungi to others, whether you develop the infection or not.|`|309086754ea46556b7f9a39adc35b045aa	Your feet are itchy and crusty and some pain in between your toes.

You'll have to withdraw from whatever benzodiazepine you substitute Xanax for. All benzodiazepines are addictive.|`|3ae2b4ea11e55a228b131f839acba1aeaa	I was taken off of Xanax the same way, Doctors don't care, I had the worst panic attacks. Its very addicting they say.

Taking another benzo to come off of it still leaves you with a problem...you're hooked on a drug.  Don't try to stop yourself. It's best left to a medical professional in a hospital who can monitor your vital signs and give you just enough medicine to help taper the drugs effects in your body until it's all gone.|`|AA11743204	I'm not sure you should ask  your Doctor first ,but a friend of mine took Vallium and they say now that Buspar can help with withdrawal effects.......Good Luck I'll pray for you :)|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Benzo's should be medically detoxed.

AA12308795	This site is made for quick weight loss before wedding with secret trick used by models to flatten tummy before wedding. Diets do not work. 99% of people gain the weight back. Here is how it works. No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.    But wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you. So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.    So it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just like the rat. But they do not want to kill you. They want you to become obese so you will buy lots of their foods. This is called GOOD BUSINESS. Remember the above (not on site) and see site below to re-learn how to eat so you can be thin and fit for life.    http://phifoundation.org|`|863ee16054ed58a87772752a08e0a99baa	Body wrap|`|d2af5a6489df33553a59bb582cdae773aa	You could try the hollywood diet.

The last thing you want to do is just make an intruder very angry.  If I was just stealing some loot from a house and someone sprayed me down with a fire exstinguisher and squirted deodorant in my eyes I'd beat their a*ss twice as bad as I had originally planned.

ufgv7oTjaa	Your best (and safest) bet would be to ask a pharmacist if there are any interactions listed between the drugs and supplements you're taking. Doctors and pharmacists both have access to a database of drug and supplement interactions and they can tell you quickly if you can safely take them together or not.... anyone here will just have a best guess from searching on the internet (which isn't always accurate, as we all know) ;-)   Acai in general doesn't have any side effects and I don't imagine there would be any interactions, but I don't have access to that database. Good luck!|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Do we look like doctors to you? Hmm?    Acai fruit seems to be ordinary fruit. It probably won't hurt you.

Try it and find out what happens?
AA11522944	Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18.    Growth during puberty often happens in spurts so dont worry if you are a little behind at any particular point... you will probably catch up. Some guys claim that their penis continued to grow until they were in their early 20s.    Approximate erect lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty          2.4 (6 cm)  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0 (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm)  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0 (10.2 cm to 12.7 cm)  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0 (12.7 cm to 15.2 cm)|`|5sSjx4GXaa	It grows slowly, and you don't even really notice unless yu measure it often.
yXlKRuItaa	Do you know if your pulse has always been this high? Some people constantly suffer with tachycardia (fast heart rate) but it could be a sign of atrial flutter, a heart condition that is easily treatable. Get yourself checked out by your GP (if you're in the UK) they may want you to wear a 24hour tape which is just a ECG machine which connects to your chest and records your heart for 24hours. Better safe than sorry.|`|aJp2TGy5aa	no its called tytachardia you need to get it checked . do you have high blood pressure or other cardio related conditions? that' kind of strain on your heart is not good for you under any condition, my advise.. please refer to your cardiologist.|`|gMHwrbRlaa	I have had this problem twice. The first time it went away after I went off a medication. The second time it started after I quit a medication.    A high pulse rate can also be caused by fever.

2sycPf8Daa	The Target Heart Rate (THR), or Training Heart Rate (THRR), is a desired range of heart rate reached during aerobic exercise which enables one's heart and lungs to receive the most benefit from a workout. This theoretical range varies based on one's physical condition, gender, and previous training. Below are two ways to calculate one's Target Heart Rate. In each of these methods, there is an element called "intensity" which is expressed as a percentage. The THR can be calculated by using a range of 50%85% intensity. However, it is crucial to derive an accurate HR to ensure these calculations are meaningful.     Heart rate reserve (HRR) is simply the difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate.There is a relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption - particularly at intensities ranging from 50-90% VO2 max (1). So traditionally, exercise intensity has been prescribed as a percentage of maximum heart rate (calculated as 220 - age). For example, a 30-year old with a maximum heart rate of 190bpm might train at 75% maximum or 143.  One of the problems with the 220-age equation is that it makes no allowances for individual differences in resting heart rate. By incorporating the heart rate reserve into the equation, in theory a more accurate training zone can be determined.    Take care as always!

You should talk to your GP about it anyways, recreational drugs can mess with your hearts electrical system...not good.|`|jYFa9eMvaa	dude i would love to know that answer the same thing has been happening to me to. ive been smoking for like a year and a half and for the past times i would smoke and my heart would beat super fast i dont know why. the lastest it started to hurt and the next day it felt sore or something idk wats going on. i could smoke a drastic amount of weed and be fine but l8ly my heart been feeling like it going to come out my chest. it never happen before to me but l8ly it been|`|YZ8XmCAraa	Stop smoking pot and see if it happens without the weed. I am a former smoker and have passed out after smoking. At least I think thats what happened.|`|m0SHCUjhaa	Sometimes it depends on how potent the stuff you're smoking is, and how much you've smoked that day.  Try sipping some water and taking deep, slow breaths to slow it down.  It's possible too that your heart isn't actually beating faster, you're just more aware of it.      How did you even check your blood pressure?  Are you a med student, or have a gauge with you?  Moreover, how did you count when you were high like that?      My advice: don't worry about it.  If it REALLY bothers you, stop smoking.  It's probably better for your health in general anyway.

Most heart murmurs are benign and you could go ahead and have an energy drink, but some murmurs are there because of some other heart condition that you have. If you know there is nothing else wrong with your heart then go ahead, if you're not sure then talk to your doctor first.|`|rfvRcOl9aa	nnooooooooooooooooooo|`|ULL3oIOeaa	nooooooooooo i had a heart murmur i drunk a red bull energy drink and bad things began shortly afterward|`|zJzUjYeTaa	I have a heart murmur I drink energy drinks all the time.

ufgv7oTjaa	That's actually the B Vitamins in it. The B Vitamins are very hygroscopic, meaning they are very sensitive to moisture. If you leave a capsule of B Vitamins out in a humid or moist area, it will puff out as well, it's perfectly normal and expected.  If you left it out longer in an oxygen-rich environment, you would also notice it would have dark spots around where the capsule pieces connect... that is normal for the Vitamin C and some other antioxidants in it. It's perfectly natural and doesn't take anything away from the product.   I hope I helped!|`|Sh7r0kNuaa	airborne just got sued for false advertising. it doesn't work. the only reason why you might feel better taking it is a placebo effect. for more info, check this out: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...|`|jJlA3RSCaa	Yes, it has happened to me.

LkOcJRRWaa	Following injury, the skin needs to seal off any broken blood vessels and fill up the hole created in the surface of the skin so that blood, lymph and other vital bodily substances are not lost. A small plug occurs first, which dries and then forms a hard shield. This is known as a scab. The scab serves a second purpose of acting as a cover to prevent entry of bacteria, dirt and other toxic or irritant substances through the injury into the skin.  The scab also forms a cover under which the underlying skin can get on with the healing process. This includes repairing the damage to the fibre structures deep in the skin and also replacing the cellular layer over the top. Once that healing process is complete, the scab will fall off leaving normal skin underneath.  If the injury to the skin is extensive, particularly if it affects the deeper layer of the skin, the healing process requires laying down of new collagen which produces a scar. If the injury only involves the surface layer of the skin, then no collagen is required and no scar forms.  Occasionally, healing can produce more tissue than is necessary merely to fill in the hole from the injury. The scar then becomes thickened, raised or may even spread out from the original site of injury. This is known as a keloid scar. Keloid scars tend to occur more often in some areas than others. They commonly occur on the upper chest and back, the upper arms and occasionally the neck.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	The glue fairy comes while your sleeping.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	A new layer of skin grows|`|eY49t8Swaa	it just does|`|xihWos2maa	Vitamin D- you get it from the sun|`|EklWkKEWaa	your red blood cells work to repair the torn skin and eventually a new layer of skin will grow  depending on how deep the cut is, the cut may form a scab and that is proof of the blood cells working to repair your skin|`|LYPUG1KLaa	White blood cells form together to form a clot so your skin will be healed|`|Xlb8QPj9aa	From the inside out.

Try www.framesdirect.com, they have good prices on frames!    Good luck! :)|`|aiBOMU9kaa	Many of the D&G frames are less than that, and some are more.    I think in most optical stores, the prices will be marked right on the frames so you won't have to keep asking.    But remember, you also have the price of your lenses to add to the price of the frame. That part may shock you too.
zddIYf9vaa	yes you can get one for $200, just search on few shops before you choose one, prices can vary|`|9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	You're better off to look for DG frames - this is Dolce and Gabbana's own "off" brand (just like Calvin Klein has "CK"). It's a less expensive option, and no one knows the difference. They both have equally cute styles - and you can save money! :) Also, try www.framesdirect.com, they have very good prices for frames. Hope that helps! :D    Good luck on your search!
nFakIvgoaa	I remember seeing a thing on MSNBC where tiny fish would nibble someone's feet as part of their pedicure.  It was really strange.      According to this article, the fish are called garra rufa but are typically known as doctor fish. They were first used in Turkey and have become popular in some Asian countries    I think this is the link:    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25783483|`|4Pk6VNftaa	I think you're mixing up 2 different stories.    In China they have a fish that will nibble at the dried skin on your feet, giving you a pedicure.   People stick their feet into a tub that has a few dozen of the small fish who would then nibble them clean and soft.      Attempts to use the same treatment in the US ran afoul with the government agencies who said that any equipment used in a pedicure must be sanitized between customers.  Obviously, trying to "sanitize" the fish would kill them.  So until a compromise can be worked out, you'll have to go to China or another Asian country to try out this treatment.    There was also an unrelated story about how doctors are looking into using maggots on wounds to clean them.  The idea is that the maggots only eat dead tissue, leaving the newly healed tissue around the wound or burn, alone.
4cJZ3SIWaa	Ok, You lie to your mother on a regular basis. You do poorly at school caused by not studying or doing homework, and you hurl profanity at your mother. Have you thought for a second that maybe you are the cause of much of your grief?    To be honest, you just look like a spoiled. In the past, your past effort was sufficient to get you by.. But as you advance, it has become harder and harder for you to "just" get by.    As you get older and you leave your mother's embrace, you are going to be in for a lot of nasty surprises. Unless you self motivate yourself, you can expect a long career asking people "Would you like Fries with that?"|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Please discuss this with the school nurse, counselor, or a trusted teacher.  Your Mom may need to learn about the possibility that you have a physical or emotional illness.  I doubt you can talk with her about this by yourself.|`|ZNc59x1daa	You should try and explain this to your mom without freaking out with each other. If you don't feel you can talk to her could you just let her read what you just wrote? I'm sure your mom is just really worried about you and will want to help once she knows how you really feel. Mothers aren't mind readers you know!! Good luck and please do talk to somebody about how you feel.|`|7TdG2vTCaa	You need to figure out what is actually causing you to have so much trouble studying.  Is it that you need some extra help?  Are you having trouble concentrating?  Have you talked to a counselor at school?  (They are there to help you, not get you in trouble.)  Maybe the two of you can get to the bottom of the problem before you end up failing.      I'm sorry that your mom is acting unsupportive.  Maybe if you are honest with her about what's going on with you, she'll change her tune and try to help you instead of attacking you.  Your depression may be stemming from the fact that you're keeping this all to yourself.  You'll never get assistance if you aren't honest with people who are there to help you.|`|tVF9O1Olaa	Your mum is probably reacting like that because she is worried and doesn't want you to fail at school.

Talk to your mum and explain that you are struggling with your moods and motivation and about talking walks because you need time alone.

Firstly just cut down your smoking, maybe just smoke a bit with friends or at night.    You want to replace your smoking with something else, preferably not other drugs, but if you have a few drinks it might seem better.  Mainly try doing a hobby,sports w/e.    I stopped because it wasn't getting me high like i first started and the negatives outweighed the positives, it felt like it was leeching on my brain and my short-term memory was pretty badly shot.      Just take it one-step at a time, don't expect a miracle straight away, you will soon realise life is much better without being constantly stoned.

1eiPSIydaa	Syncope (fainting) happens because not enough oxygen-carrying blood reaches the brain and can be caused by a number of things.    It could definitely be because of low blood sugar, but of course your Paadiatrician is taking care to look for anything else.     It's good that you have had another EKG it as it could be used to find any problems you might have, but It may also find nothing wrong.    I couldn't take a guess at why you fainted or you previous chest pains, but the reason for the EKG is so that the doctor can have you checked out that all is well or otherwise.      All the best with the results.|`|coFWlptOaa	EKG is an electrocardiogram.     It lets them check your heart for defects.|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	i had the same thing happen to me...chances are it was just low blood sugar(like in my case). not to say you are diabetic, but it happens sometimes.  the chest pain could be several things, but that is a good thing to have an EKG to check on.  i had an EKG when i passed out, and it just confirmed there was nothing wrong with my heart (now...i was born with a hole in my heart, but that healed).  You should honestly be fine, but its good to have gotten the EKG just to be safe.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	It would be really rare for you to have heart problems, but the doctor wants to rule it out. You could have a congenital defect that was never detected. My grandmother lived with one for over 70 years before finding out about it.   I think you shouldn't necessarily get too worried. I hope they figure out what is wrong and that you have a speedy recovery. Take good care!|`|JQIztxIlaa	Don't be scared, because an EKG is pretty much the first device that is used to examine heart condition. If there were a problem they would do other examinations like an ultrasound.    What is a bit weird for me is that you have to wait for the result. EKG produces result immediately.
4Pk6VNftaa	Well, it's a traditional comfort food.    Hot liquids are good when you have a sore throat.    Soup has vegetables in it, which your body needs to fight off the illness.  Chicken noodle soup doesn't contain milk or cream - both of which can make a cough worse.    There's also been some studies that show that the chicken broth itself seems to actually help your body fight off the common cold.

They do this because often what helps a person get better is their brain thinking they will get better, so chemicals are released which will help heal their sicknesses.    Hope this helps you!

Vk7kkrcLaa	most eyelid surgery is done under a local anaesthetic rather than a general anaesthetic. this means that you are still awake but you feel no pain in the eyelid area. it is done this way as it is much safer and there are fewer side effects.    the procedure lenght varies depending on which type of eyelid surgery it is. for removal of cysts it can take as little as 5 minutes. eye lid corrective surgery can take upto 30 minutes.    it is not painful while you are having the surgery as the local anaesthetic numbs that area. after you have has the surgery that area often feels tender or slightly sore for upto one week, but its very mild pain.

5sXV5mEfaa	these drugs are sedatives like valium and alcohol and they work on the same receptor (GABA).  Like alcohol, these drugs diminish inhibitions, give some euphoria, slur speech and induce sleep.  These drugs are also part of the cocktail we execute death row inmates with.    Nembutal, seconal are fast acting barbs that are abused.  Phenobarb is slow onset and long lasting so it has much less abuse potential and is used to treat siezures.  The trouble with barbiutates is that we very rapidly become tolerant to the pleasant effects meaning that you have to take more and more of them to get the same high.  Unfortunately, the lethal dose is close to the dose that gets you high.    Treatment of barb addiction is not going cold turkey--the withdrawls from barbs can kill you.  You have to get detoxed, usually using valium type drugs.    ps xanax is not a barb, it is like valium and the withdrawls from xanax are nasty, lasting for a month but not life threatening like barbituate withdrawl.|`|U1l1ZFqRaa	Be careful about going "cold turkey" a friend of mine was taking them and had siezures when he couldn't get anymore. Wound up in the hospital for a few days.|`|CwaWiNzuaa	they killed jimi hendrix|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	- the barbiturates just make you feel great and happy they just are amazing little pills and very very addictive , i have been on them for years now and have stopped taking them just this week...    -they can cause seizures when you come off of them also another thing is they just make you not care about things as much    -i dont know what you mean about the methods of addiction treatment.  I mean i am doing it cold turkey and it sucks all i can think about is the pills but i just dont give myself access to any so other than that there is outpatient rehab or full blown rehab.  you can also go to the hospital and turn yourself in for detox and you will have to be in the hospital until you are done unless you choose to leave i guess      sorry i hope this all helped im not an expert but i have been taking xanax 2 mg every day since i was 19 well i am 24 now so i know how addictive these things are|`|7jDyJRLyaa	Barbiturates slow endorphins creating a euphoric type state for the user.  This should answer your first 2 questions.    To treat this type of addiction usually requires the user going "cold turkey" and suffering through tremendous withdrawals.
Ms72jNbBaa	In countries where black magic is given a lot of credibility, these sorts of things happen routinely.  In the U.S., where black magic is viewed with some degree of skepticism, they still do happen sometimes.  Of course black magic is not the only thing that can cause business and other losses.  However, supernatural forces are active in this world.  Keep close to God, ask Him to rule in your affairs, and trust Him completely.  Give Him all the glory for your successes.  If it is black magic, Satan can "buffet but not overcome!"    Blessings!
ufgv7oTjaa	Absolutely!  B Vitamins are water-soluble, so you can take them a few times throughout the day. However, if your body doesn't need the nutrition that they give, your body may not absorb it and it could pass out of your system unused. Because of that, B-12 really just boosts the energy if your body needs it.  You should be careful because taking too much of them too often can also cause an overdose... it just takes a lot to OD on the water soluble vitamins. Taking the extra dose once a day shouldn't be a problem, though. Good luck and I hope I helped!
nh04ZJnQaa	dude your sick, as in ill. Don't worry you'll be fine in a week or 2. The smell you smell, is coming from your nose, it is nasty bacteria... you got sinus infection. no bug has crawled up there.|`|jazKtgENaa	LOL you really should go to a doctor|`|aecb87753b7a91041ba0f8e18327da41aa	i don't think so. your nose is not just an ornament on your face, it is a highly important structure, this is where you breathe, your life depends on it. your body is programmed to protect your vital organs with a complex set of reflexes and defenses.  if something attempts to enter your nose you will inmediately sniff out, just like you would gag if something goes inside your throat uninvited. when a tiny particle of dust gets in your nose you coagh or sneeze to get it out. imagine  A BUG going in there and your body not reacting? i don't think so.  however if you feel weird, then your body's telling you something's wrong. better get it checked.|`|4eBtqOE4aa	This is certainly possible...A bug may have crawled up there and died or layed eggs. It could also be an ear infection or sinus infection, for both of these cause nasty medicine taste and odor. I would go to a doctor and get it checked out.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	If you notice a butterfly come out of it in the next few days you'll know something did.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	I think you could blow your nose and a bug would come out. It is also possible to swallow a bug. It is unlikely for a bug to just remain dead in one place. The nose is self cleaning and tiny hairs would sweep it away.   It can be a tonsil stone which has a very bad odor, something stuck in your teeth, or a sinus infection.|`|eVvohzxMaa	A bug wouldn't smell like that.    Could you have accidentally inhaled someting that smells similar?    It is possible that the scent was stuck on your nose hairs, now I don't mean to be groos, but different suctances can latch on to nose hair-which could easily explain these scents.    Hope I helped!
55oy2i5caa	Please don't be planning her funeral yet - she hasn't even been diagnosed! Concentrate on making the most of each and every day (sickness or not). Let her know how much you love her and spend family time together anyway. If she's diagnosed with a disease, the doctors will help you all with a plan of action.|`|AA10450066	If she was or is a smoker she can bet on the emphysema,I'm surprised it's not C.O.P.D. which is a combination of lung disorders, that is not reversible. Medications can help ease the symptoms, but that's all. If your mom has breast cancer it depends on what stage it's in.If she's had mammograms according to how old she is then it might have been caught right away and depending on the rest of her health there are several different ways the doctor will talk to her about.I can tell you really love your mom but for now just be there for her and don't forget that you may be worrying about nothing yet.I hope all goes well for you both.
T1z1SGe3aa	dont worry.  like 68% of people have herpes in the us.  9/10 people NEVER will feel the virus.  it doesnt kill you,but it is annoying.  trust me,i doubt any medication/doctors will be needed.  if anything the most you will have is a checkup on the doctor if they see signs.  if they do,you might need blood taken(dont worry,it doesnt hurt much,unless you have a doctor like mine wher she takes it out and puts it back in cuz shes not a good doc,lol,tru story)  trust me,  its nothing big.    edit:dont listem to dave,its true.  almost 70%.  lol i searched africa and it was 99%  im never goin ther lol|`|m0SHCUjhaa	I'm not sure if you'll get it or not, but the reality is that 70% of people get cold sores.  Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus.  So yeah, you'd have herpes, but it's NOT the scary, slutty kind that gets such a bad rap.  Don't be sad or nervous, just try not to share his food and try to notice when he has a cold sore.|`|wkMncMobaa	Lovelyone is full of crap.  70% is a totally made up percentage.  If you don't have a real answer, maybe you should just shut up and not answer the question.|`|yrIZFRFbaa	oh sure ,      just say a small prayer & steal it ?????????????|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You really need to touch the infected area while it is in the blister stage to contract this virus.    Simply eating a french fry isn't likely to cause infection.     I'd relax and don't worry about it.
riFDDdscaa	If he was taking cholesterol medication, they do not prevent arteries from blocking. What ever dismal effect they have on the heart, does not come from lowering the cholesterol numbers. The Vytorin study (ENHANCE) proved this. They added a second cholesterol lowering drug to the statin, Zocor. They measured the plaque and the group who lowered their cholesterol an extra 18%, had more plaque and double the RATE of change. Hmmm, do you think that is why they tried to hide the results for 2 years, while they advertised the hell out of "the two sources of cholesterol"  Another thing that is of NO help, avoiding saturated fat.   Pharmacist who's life was almost ruined by Lipitor|`|sw2R5A9iaa	go to the next cardiologist appointment with your dad & have the medical professional answer your questions.|`|LmicIEOxaa	Cholesterol causes blocked arteries. If he stops eating meat entirely and eats salmon at least 6 days a week for dinner, and only uses olive oil (no butter or margarine), plus plenty of green vegetables, onions and garlic, his arteries should improve. They will become more flexible and less blocked. He should also walk at a moderate pace for 40 minutes a day, no longer.
FT2dOlZEaa	There is no definite line you have to cross to be straight or gay. Rather there is a continuum between being straight or gay. With straight on one end, gay on the other and bisexual in the middle.     Straight----------Bi--------Gay    You could fall anywhere along the continuum depending on how far you are willing to go with the same and opposite sex and also how you feel about it yourself.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	If you've never had an occasion to be around males a lot when gowing up - I would think one would be somewhat curious to see what another guy has or doesn't have.  The arousal might be envy.  Whatever, learn to live with it & get on with the rest of your life.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	listen to me you do not have to ask this question   if something pleases you then be happy   it is your choice how you feel about something|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	you are feeling guilty that maybe you are looking interesting in males sexually. It does not mean you are gay if you are curious.  Just means your hormones are mixed up that you are not interested in women in a sexual way.|`|7e4349dce38654728dc0f4d3d3692380aa	As the majority of the time when we meet another male he is clothed so it is obvious that when we get the chance to see a partially dressed man we look.  It is curiosity no need to worry as most men have done it.  There is too much of the worry of the gay feeling, it can be in everything if you let it.  How can there be a line where it starts and finishes.  Is it gay to be in sports with other men, how about contact sports, you touch as well as look.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	It is not abnormal!    At age 20, you are at your likely all time peak in sexual performance and sexual ability. You will find that anything that point toward "sex" ...period will have a level of turn on ability attached to it.    I'm not gay, but I'm not horrified and homophobic either!     You can find that identifying with what you would consider to be the ideal male look and identifying mentally into his ability to getting lucky with the Ladies can be a turn on, totally not homosexual, but identity driven.    In the locker room, again if you are charged, it can simply bring, not wanting Dudes, but the idea of "sex" to mind. The idea of sex does what?...turns you on! All of these Dudes are sexual being, and are thinking about sex as well in some degree and level. It isn't their equipment that's interesting especially, but nudity brings thoughts toward sex when you are max. ready for sex.     If you love the Ladies, don't worry about it. It's only a problem if you worry and turn it into something beyond what it is.   When you get married and having real Loving, your level of being charged up tapers down and you become more sexually focused instead of the brain grabbing at whatever speaks..."sex association"    Feel good about your self Dude, because you are good Man, and don't worry about this.    Hope that helps you to understand a bit more about the dynamics of sex?    Me! :- )|`|jCyZI6YNaa	from what i hear, it sounds gay, but idk, never will i EVER be gay. No Offense.|`|9xjBirQ9aa	no, its not. and i know what you mean, you are probably envious of them, whether you are muscled or not.... you'll come out of it!|`|zMDkllJvaa	its diffrent but not gey lol and ignore ignorance lol ok you set this up if you get hate crap|`|M63kq3AYaa	Not normal for a heterosexual male, no.|`|5e1d217c8c231120f789426cabdc7d33aa	idk but you know you are gay if you like other men like you feel urges that you want to sleep with them|`|dkoGI9nfaa	It appears that you have a fear of probably being gay.  That is very common.  From what you say however it does not appear that you are gay.  Sexual arousal is a funny thing.  As you say you don't lust for a man but looking at the type of guy you describe you get a little horny.  Often it is a case of the mind imagining that person in a heterosexual activity.  You are thus putting yourself in that person's position i.e. as a male thinking what it is like being with a female.  If on the other hand you are gay.  Be glad that you live in the 21st century.  It is OK to be gay.  And if you are and don't want others to know that is OK as well.  Being gay does not mean you need to act like a girl.
6NA2MXNPaa	Your skin becomes extremely sensitive to sunlight when taking doxycycline. If you go tanning, chances are you'll burn really bad, possibly get blisters. Even if you only tan for a short while. Better to wait the 7-10 days that it takes to be done with the meds than to risk the burn!|`|Rt22TGXUaa	I assume you mean besides getting skin cancer and dying, right?
CHiEKZrLaa	It's going to depend on what the TCM (traditional Chinese Medicine) diagnosis is...  but generally, you should expect to have some needles in your lower legs (near the knees, near the ankles or on your feet) and a few either in your abdomen or your back.  And it's also possible there will be one/some near the wrist.    If you're nervous about the needles, let your doc know.  There are things she can do to "distract" the nerves so you hardly feel a thing.    Good luck!
FcGE3PH4aa	You can take ECP more than one time. It is best not to use is as birth control (which means taken regularly). EC is an increased form of birth control so it is not dangerous and will not cause any long term effects. Take EC as needed but I would suggest starting a more reliable birth control.
vB5cTqrzaa	Expressing yourself creatively, drawing, painting, hell even paper mache (I'm not kidding).  Start a journal writing down what's going in your life.  Exercise (cliche but helps) and dietary changes (do you eat a lot of processed foods - people react differently to all those chemical - it's called brain fog AND can contribute to depression)...and of course go find someone to TALK to - school counselor, shrink, witch doctor,  whatever it takes.|`|G3xC859saa	Cutting yourself will ultimately make you more depressed because you will have scars from your cuts will make you feel bad about how you look and you will continue to sink deeper and deeper with every scar i suggest that you stop cutting yourself and start trying to solve some of the problems that brought you to this place. If you do drugs, i would suggest you stop,that would be a good start.  Try painting and read the Fountain Head by ayn rand. Its very difficult reading but you can do it it will chance your life. Im not a book junkie but its an old classic by one of the greatest writers of all times. Having read the Fountain Head you will understand that being an individual and being yourself is of the ut most importance, and not to follow the crowd. Also you will be able to carry on Intelligent, stimulating conversations with like minded individuals. You will be less depressed then.|`|Jub8KYUEaa	smoking pot...|`|n8nhjmfraa	do anything but cut yourself. that is the worst thing to do. take it from me because once you start you can't stop and that's all you think about when you are feeling hurt or frustrated. i started cuting a few years ago and just couldn't stop til now but it's only been like a month. and sometimes cuting yourself can be really dangerous. i cut myself one time and it wouldnt stop bleeding for like an hour.   instead of cuttin get a stress ball or try runnin i started doin that and i felt a lot better. basically do anythin that will help keep your mind off whatever it is that's bothering you enough to consider cutting|`|XjEe5y0yaa	Try writing, u don't have to be a super writer or anythin....just write a letter....could be to someone u trust, or someone u wish u could talk to, anyone!

Find somebody you can trust - a friend or a counsellor - and who will listen, and talk to them. Not for the sake of it, but to explore your feelings-  why do you feel the way you do? Why do you cut yourself as a way of dealing with it? What does cutting yourself mean to you?    Sounds like a load of gush but it worked for me.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Try antidepressants.

is4zQxltaa	a check up is really the same thing as a physical. as kids, we are prone to more diseases, infections, accidents, etc., so we end up going to the doctor more often. as you get older, you have been vacinated for just about everything worth being vacinated for. so, as an adult its a spontaneous thing. if you need to see a doctor, you go. however, try to see a doctor once a year if your family has a history of many different diseases. hope this helped. :)|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I believe a check up and physical are pretty much the same thing.  And for typical healthy adults you should get a physical once a year.  If you have a health condition that needs closer monitoring or you're much older your doctor may want to see you more often.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	The "annual checkup" is still recommended by some schools,camps, employers, and the army. However, doctors seldom go to each other for routine checkups. Checkups don't detect treatable diseases early with any regularity, and they may raise false confidence; that is, they may encourage the false belief that if you're regularly checked you don't need to concern yourself as much about developing good health habits.  Your primary interest is in finding conditions about which something can be done, and for this the checkup is unfortunately not very useful. If you use the techniques described above to reduce your health risks, and if you attend to new symptoms as discussed, you'll gain few advantages from an annual "complete checkup."    Are "complete" checkups ever worthwhile? Yes. The first examination by a new doctor allows you to establish a relationship with him or her. Increasingly, the periodic checkup is being used not as much for the detection of disease as for the opportunity to counsel the patient about poor health habits, so that patients can do a better job of personal disease prevention.     We applaud this change and look to doctors to further refine their skills at influencing their patients to take care of themselves. And good luck.
76cAAPfBaa	I tried one for quite a while, and it made me feel worse. I didn't however try switching arms, or rotating it differently like you did. I eventually gave up on it, and threw it in a drawer, where it is today.    P.S. This was given to me by another person, that it also didn't work for.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Sound like classic gall bladder inflammation symptoms, from location to where the pain radiates.    Check out whether it's worse when you eat, or worse when you eat something fatty. If that provokes it, you've got your diagnosis.    Aneurysms are far more abrupt and acutely painful, aren't they?|`|xRvetiAMaa	You may have 'pinched' a nerve in your back. A good Palmer graduate Chiro can eliminate the trouble with ONE visit. Don't be sold a series of 10.    Look up Bowen Therapy in your area. The first visit will make a difference. Don't need too many visits, either. Some Massage Therapists practice Bowen. Ask.

SFIt308Iaa	When I was 20 to 28 years of age I too, had a lot of popping and cracking noises.  I jumped trampoline 3 hours a day during those times.  When I hit my 30's it all just went away.  I don't think you have too much to worry about, but I would consider eating more potassium.  I have had knee arthritis for the last 18 years.  I've tried glucosamine with chondroitin and it didn't seem to work.  Then I started eating a couple of bananas each day and drinking Apple jiuce in the last month and have had amazing results.  My knees ache very little now.  Potassium is a very vital mineral your body needs for joints, muscle, and even lowering blood pressure.  I'd look into it.  Good Luck!|`|xRvetiAMaa	The clicking + pain indicates a condition called "crepitus". Not to worry.    Crepitus is a sign of osteroarthritis (non-crippling type). You just have it at an early age. Think about EZ swimming as good therapy for your whole bod. Walk, if nothing else (work up to 15 blocks a day). Do not over-stress your joints. Does arthritis show up in your family early?    If pain or stiffness increases, see an Internal Medicine MD for examination. There's no cure; but millions learn to live with arthritis.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	It could be a problem.  Id recommend going to an orthopedic surgeon.  He can help with possibly cortizone shots, physical therapy, a certain brace or if needed, surgery.  I've had the same type of problem with my right shoulder for 2 years, it cracks and pops and is gross.  I've done basically all I can, the last thing the dr.'s trying is a certain brace that will pull my shoulders back so I don't slump b/c that makes it hurt worse.  Then if that doesn't work, I have to get surgery.  It sounds invasive and will take 5 - 6 months to fully recover.  So you want to do anything if at all possible before surgery, but it's something worth checking out.  And just b/c those things didn't work for me, doesn't mean it wont work for you. :)

c75dc3fc5fe8ac6da1614ba44c0fd1ebaa	I dont think that is possible.  I work for hospitals here in Colorado, and there are very strict laws as to patient confidentiality.      Even if you call certain hospitals, if the patient requests that no one be notified that he/she is there, the hospital cannot even tell you if they are a patient there.  In other cases, they can tell you they are there, and their condition (critical, stable, etc)|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	i've personally never heard of any website like that. i DO know that patients information is all strictly confidential so if there is such a place, the patient would have to be directly involved in posting their statistics, as it would be against the law for hospital personnel to do so without a signed release or waiver; so ask your friend~ he/she or a relative, should know.
61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	the labyrinth is an apparatus in the inner ear that is made up of three semicircular canals surrounded by fluid.   When the head moves, signals are transmitted to the labyrinth~which then transmits movement information to the vestibular nerve, and the vestibular nerve carries the information to the brainstem and cerebellum (areas of the brain that control coordination, balance, movement, blood pressure, and consciousness). There are a number of different causes for dizzy spells.    ~Some medications and environmental chemicals (e.g., lead, mercury, tin) can cause ototoxicity (i.e., ear poisoning), which may result in damage to the inner ear or the 8th cranial nerve (acoustic nerve) and cause vertigo. The damage can be permanent or temporary.   ~Long-term use or high doses of certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides [streptomycin, gentamicin]) and antineoplastics (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin) can cause perma-nent ototoxicity.   ~Medications that may cause temporary ototoxicity include the following:   ~Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamaze-pine) ~Antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine, amoxapine), ~Antihypertensives (e.g., labetalol, enalapril), ~Loop diuretics (e.g., bumetanide, furosemide), ~Pain relievers (e.g., aspirin), ~Prescription and over-the-counter cold medicines, ~Quinine (e.g., chloroquine, Quinidine), ~Alcohol, even in small amounts, can cause temporary vertigo in some people.|`|74f6e9c781f075922b7cd21447a9fab7aa	Labyrinthitis--an infection or inflammation of the inner ear causing dizziness and loss of balance.     There are various options for treating balance disorders. One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon symptoms, medical history, general health, examination by a physician, and the results of medical tests.     Another treatment option includes balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include movements of the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote compensation for the disorder. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.     For people diagnosed with Mnire's disease, dietary changes such as reducing intake of sodium may help. For some people, reducing alcohol, caffeine, and/or avoiding nicotine may be helpful. Some aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin and streptomycin, are used to treat Mnire's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical gentamicin (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. Gentamicin also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.     A program of talk therapy and/or physical rehabilitation may be recommended for people with anxiety.     I personally watch my salt intake to keep the extra fluid out of my inner ear, take Meclizine when I am having some problems and if really bad a Xanax to deaden the nerve.  Know your triggers for it.  For me, sometimes moving to fast, a cold/allergies, too much salt/water retention.|`|9ad0bcaa052929a371a7c6d36c750562aa	If I remember correctly, it's an inflammation or infection in the inner ear that causes the person to lose their balance.

AA10046040	No. It is NOT possible to have a normal menstrual period  when you have a viable gestation in utero.  Some women have bleeding during early pregnancy that they think is a period, because somtimes it happens when they would normally have a period. If you think you are pregnant and having bleeding,   I would seek the attention of a physician.  He can do a simple blood test called a Beta Quantitative Analysis that can tell  definitively if you are pregnant and approximately how far along you are.|`|AA11738782	Yes, it's common to have a mini period when the baby implants itself into your uterus.  After that, it's not common to bleed.    If you are pregnant, and you're bleeding, then see your doctor right away!|`|b20e8a86dd6ffa04ae8d661727a79c74aa	Yes.

Get to a doctor ASAP!!!|`|55012273311aa4a0e6318a25d8ad3b36aa	Yes, you can.  It would probably be lighter, more like spotting.  Get to your doctor to make sure everything's okay.  God bless you!|`|ec350cab2f0698d02942c7e50e645a00aa	Yes, you can. It can vary drastically, from being an unstable and irregular period to something just as normal as it's always been. There's really no way to be sure unless you're tested.    I heard a story of a woman who had been trying to get pregnant, had her period every month, no morning sickness, but gained weight and it showed in her belly. They wouldn't offically test her for pregancy for months. She had a healthy delivery and everything. Kinda creepy, really.

AA10046040	Some of the drawbacks of an IUD are:    Irregular bleeding which typically lasts for a few months after insertion.  In rare cases, a woman's body will expel their IUD in the first year of use.  There is a small risk that your uterus will be perforated during insertion, possibly resulting in complications.    On the plus side for the Mirena IUD:  The hormone levonorgestrel helps shrink uterine fibroids, decreases menstrual cramping, and can reduce blood loss by 97 percent.  It may also lower your risk of endometrial cancer.  It is 99.9 percent effective.    ParaGard IUD:  Research shows that ParaGard may lower your risk of developing endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers, although experts aren't sure why.  ParaGard contains no hormones.

AA10515207	I was tested several times and each time I told them I didn't want to know.  For one thing it labels a person--either gift or otherwise.  Second, it's a biased, subjective test--it tests basic knowledge and facts.  It doesn't tell you that you may be gifted in music, writing, art, even mechanics.  I'd rather develop my talents using the intelligence I already have and being smart enough to know when I need to learn more about a subject--and how to look up that information.  Bragging rights don't mean much since hardly anyone knows what the average IQ is anyway.    But, if you think your IQ is correct, then congrats to you and best luck to you in your future.

However, they didn't tell me which test they gave me or what the standard deviation was, so the number by itself is meaningless.    They gave me the IQ test because I was transferring from a private school to the public school system.  They were going to make me retake 6th grade because of my age.  After they gave me my results, not only did I get to go to 7th grade, they also put me in the gifted program.    So, while the IQ score itself is meaningless, that test probably saved me many years of anguish.|`|AA12394429	When I was a kid, I used to have my IQ tested twice during each school year because I was learning very quickly...quickly enough that it caused our family to have to make some adjustments (schools for gifted children and so on).  The tests were conducted by psychologists who worked with schools, much as they do today.  There was little deviation in scores, and by the time I graduated from high school the average of all of the tests was 163.  As an adult, I have only had it tested twice - once after a car accident with head injury, and once about eight months ago.  To my disappointment, it has dropped quite a bit - the two adult scores average out to 158.  I have been in school in some capacity all of my life - since high school I've been in college or in vocational/technical courses most of the time because I don't feel quite myself if I am not learning something new.  I appreciate my intelligence and feel that it is my gift, and I try not to take it for granted or use it to make others feel bad, and that's really the only awareness I have of it these days.  I am working hard on raising my emotional intelligence, which can be lacking in intellectual people.  I think that it is important that highly intelligent people set intellect aside and develop their people skills, particularly when they're young, because all the smarts in the world can't make a person nice :-)|`|AA10512023	152 i am smart too. and i answered it in a foreign language, so that makes me smarter!!!|`|4102d894a2c1a9cccd9b28932c6d120baa	um.....and where did you have your IQ tested? if it was an online test, it is not at all accurate.

First because of the change in your appetite and calorie requirements I'd go see my family doctor-no sense guessing for again a lot of things,hormones, stress and so on and so on.

f94bdf996fcb6056dfff878a57a81d8aaa	The truth is (and I'm sure this comes at no surprise to you) that  there is no fast and easy way to weight loss. The "best" way to lose  weight though, is a combination of dieting and aerobic exercise.  That's it. A maintained schedule of running and dieting will result in  weight loss. I can attest to this from personal experience. I will  explain this in detail further in my answer.    That said, let me address a point you raised in your question:    "Much advice seems to suggest that exercise that targets the muscles  in the stomach area (e.g. sit-ups) would help. To me that seems  illogical, or perhaps misleading. In its most simple form, is weight  loss not a simple equation involving a=amount of energy input to body  from food and b=amount of energy used by body and c=weight gained or  lost expressed as energy: a-b=c ? with weight loss acheived by either  1) decreasing energy intake through dieting, or 2) increasing energy  consumption through exercise or 3) both.  When fat is burned up by the  body as reserve fuel, is the physical pattern of 'burning' dependent  on the location of the muscles requiring the energy, or a uniform  pattern, or a geneticly-determined pattern, or something else?"    Doing situps does burn calories, and will burn fat, if done correctly.  However the same and better results in terms of calorie loss can be  achieved by doing any form of aerobic exercise. I believe your friends  were operating under the myth that fat can turn into muscle or muscle  can turn into fat. See the article "Can Muscle Turn To Fat?" at  NaturalStrength.com:  http://www.naturalstrength.com/features/...    What sit ups does do is tone your abdominal muscles. However, it does  not "target" the fat in your tummy any more than any other form of  aerobic exercise. In fact, if you only do situps as your aerobic  exercise, what will happen is that you will build up abdominal muscles  in your abs, but it would be still covered in the same layers of fat  as before.    "The first place we usually lose fat is on our face (so our mothers  can tell us we look too thin). Unfortunately, it is not possible to  direct our bodies to burn fat from a particular area."  "Take sit-ups for example. It is important to keep your stomach (and  back) muscles in shape, and firm abs can even help to hold in your  stomach. But to reduce the size of your mid-section, you would do just  as well to perform any exercise that you enjoy."  Source: http://www.eatwellandexercise.com/faqs_s...      The only way to reduce fat is through aerobic exercise. From personal  experience, the most effective form of aerobic exercise would have to  be running or jogging. I'll explain why in response to the next point  you've made:     "It seems to me that while there's probably variation from individual  to individual, the variables involved (e.g. calories ingested, current  body fat proportion etc) must be interrelated and subject to a set of  laws which could form useful graphs or simple programs that would  allow a person to predict weight loss, armed with a knowledge of the  relevant variables..."    Actually, the variables involved are not limited to calories in/out  and body fat proportion. I think one of the most important factors  involved in the equation is metabolism. Metabolism is a measure of how  much fat you burn from doing no activities. It depends on the fitness  level of your heart and other muscles. For example, long distance  runnners would have higher metabolisms than normal people due the  their muscle mass and fitness levels. What this means is that they can  effectively eat more than other people can, without weight gain.  (Unfair, I know!)    The best way to increase your metabolism is running. This is from  personal experience. I used to be fairly overweight, until I joined a  competitive long distance running training program. In just a month, I  noticed significant amounts of fat loss all over my body. What is  interesting is that my calorie intake was more, not less, than before.  This leads me to conclude that the increase in metabolism contributed  to my weight loss.    So to sum up, aerobic exercise and dieting is the best and only way to  lose weight. Dieting though, involves counting calories. You have to  count your calories in any diet. Even a small snack here and there add  up. I've provided links to tools where you can keep track of your  metabolism and calorie count as well as additional articles that will  be of interest to you:    Additional Links:    BMI, BMR Calculator  http://caloriesperhour.com/    Basal Metabolism Calculator  http://www.room42.com/nutrition/basal.sh...

AA11096432	You need to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. The 45 minute thing is not true, but don't over 60 minutes at a time.    Do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.

(Toxic Shock Syndrome- really dangerous bacterial infection, can lead to sterility and/or death.) The average period lasts for about a week, some can be much longer or shorter, though. Outside things can affect it, as well. When I went on the Depo-Privera shot, mine lasted for a month, it was horrible. (Don't go on the shot!) I've also had really short periods, though, like ones that lasted for about two days.|`|032f13d362bf1d11d467b3487c0e14cfaa	I change mine every 2 hours.

AA10991881	First, buy a brand which has a plastic applicator, not a cardboard one. That makes things much easier. My favourite brand personally is Tampax compax.    Try to find ones which are designed for lighter days when you're just starting out. Yes, you'll probably have to change it more often, but they're very small so easiest to learn with.    When you're going to put one in, you have to relax. Get into a position where it will be easiest - most people suggest sitting on the toilet with your legs wide apart, or putting one foot on the edge of the bath. Personally, I find the easiest way is to crouch down with my knees wide apart.     Take the tampon in your right hand (assuming you're right handed). Spread the labia with your left hand and gently insert the tampon into the vagina. Push it in gently until the fingers of your right hand are touching the skin. That's the most important part - it has to be far enough in or it will be uncomfortable. If you're having trouble getting it in, try pushing slightly to one side or the other, or slightly rotating the tampon as you push it in. If you find it a bit dry going in, you could try using a bit of vaseline on the tip of the tampon.    Once the fingers of your right hand are touching the skin, use your left hand to push the applicator in all the way, as far as it goes - again, if you feel a bit of resistance try pushing slightly to one side or the other, then withdraw the applicator and the tampon should be in place.    If the tampon is in the right place, you won't be able to feel it inside you at all. It's difficult to get the hang of at first, but just keep trying, I promise you it's worth it!!! No more messy pads, no more gushing of blood when you sneeze or move position.......tampons are definitely the way to go!!! Good luck!|`|AA11434180	Never put vaseline on a tampon! It can harbor germs.If you have to use anything-use KY. Stand with one leg on the toilet and deep breath several times. From behind,gently insert the tampon.If you can not go on because it is too dry or you have pain-stop. You may not be relaxed enough or the tampon is too big. Try a smaller size.|`|AA11062342	First, your vaginal area has to be clean.  Second, you have to put vaseline (grease) on the tampon, so that when you ease it in it wont hurt.  Third, You can sit on the toilet, or have one leg on your tub, and the other on the ground.  Fourth, Put the tampon in your vagina by relaxing your muscles and not rushing it in by pushing it in slowly but not shoving it in*  Fifth, when it is in their is a piece sticking out that piece you take out so that you can have the string sticking out.  Sixth, make sure it fits comfortably.  Good Luck!|`|AA11032838	Sit on the toilet and try to relax. If  you are on your period,  that will be your lubricate. Use your fingers on one hand to part your genital lips. With your other hand, feel for the opening where your period is coming from. That is the spot where the tampon goes.  Relax and slowing insert into the vagina. If this is your first time using tampons, you may want to use smaller size. And. use     a panty shield for extra protection.  If you find that your period is heavy , you may want to use one thats regular or super.  But, remember to change often and not to forget its there. Hope this helped.|`|899700ef9e215b30f663dbc299eb0f06aa	Well to be honest with you it's just something that you have to try a few times. It took me tons of times to finally get it right and feel comfortable with it. The first few times that I tried it hurt too.     Just if you use them make sure you don't shove the applicator up there. I have heard more than once about girls not knowing how to use tampons and putting everything up there, including the plastic applicator.

AA11981333	Breakthrough bleeding is when you have some bleeding or 'spotting' at a different time than your normal period. A normal cycle is 28 days therefore when your hormones are fluctuating as they do when commencing the pill and not having a routine established, you will get some breakthrough.    If you forget to take your pill at times... and the hormone levels drop then bleeding will occur. To prevent it, make sure you are very regular with taking the pill.

I would assume having a tilt (and doctors have told me that I do for sure) would mean my cervix is a little off to the side, which means  any discharge is going to be off to the side.  You might have to try a different brand...I think playtex expands/opens from the center & may be a bit more effective, or you might just have to invest in some pantiliners & call it good.|`|AA10991881	There are other fluids in your body that the tampon is absorbing.

Change your tampons often even if your tampon is not leaking to ensure that natural balance of fluids is present. Try wearing pads at night as well.

It can stay in all day and is totally ecological, and has no side-effects.  I found it to be excellent, because you feel clean, and there is no irritation from tampon strings or serviette chafing. Similarly, you can forget about your period all day. I can recommend it!  I ordered mine off the internet.  It takes a little getting used to at first but insertion and removal is really simple.  The only down side is that you need to rinse it when you empty it and this isn't ideal in a public toilet, as you need a sink.  However, as you can where it for long lengths of time you can make sure you're in a private bathroom when you empty it.|`|AA10991881	You have great answers already.|`|AA10086962	It's call a diva cup  I have not tried it.

The website provides a free package so you can try it out.    It's fantasic and I use it, exclusively now.  It is a little wierd to insert the first couple of times, and a little weird to take out the first couple of times--but then again, wasn't the tampon at first too?!    Anyway, i think you are only supposed to wear it for 12 hours--less if your flow is heavier.    One of the downs is that you won't want to change it out in a public restroom as it can be a bit messy, and you'll want a sink right nearby for washing your hands.  Of course if you use Playtex, Carefree or Always wipes you can eliminate that problem.    A plus is that you can't even feel it, like sometimes you can feel a tampon and it is so weird to have something dangling there.   You can have sex while it is in--my boyfriend swears he can't even tell it is there--so there's no mess.  It absolutely isn't a contraceptive device though--the box warns as such.  My suggestion is that you insert a brand new one just before sex, and even though it won't be near full, i would take it out right after and put in a new one--i think that's just my own weirdness about being clean.    Hope this helps.|`|AA11643748	ive heard of a cup but not a disk... maybe provide a website?|`|bd77a0653702376d21da484830c761d3aa	Well, they have been around a long time and there are several different manufactorers. The Keeper is probably the most popular. You should not wear it 24 hours, they are awesome. Lots of crunchy moms use these to save $$ it is a washable reusable product. Many websites that sell clothe diapers will carry things like this for women. They work great and are as comfy to use like a diaphram, if it is inserted correctly you will not feel it. If you have heavy periods and pass clots ,not want to use them cause of spotting etc... I also think it would be better to use something else when you are working out. The diva cup is another one like the keeper I think it is silcone adn the keeper is rubber. It used to be latex which many women had reactions to so that is why it is come back into popularity. My grandma used a keeper back in the depression. This is not a new item. If you are into helping preserve the earth and the keeper is not for you, try gladrags. Just google it :)   good luck! edited to add Keeper is a great easy to use product and so are the sea sponges,|`|ac0e8f04311fe9a9a02dafd0fc11f0f3aa	There is a cup-like device that fits over the cervix and catches menstrual discharge called INSTEAD.  It can be worn for up to 12 hours and comes in a purple-ish package.  It can be found on the same isle with other feminine hygiene stuff, but look closely for it, because the boxes are not that big.    I tried these when they first came out about 10 years ago and didn't like them.  They were hard to get in and out and it was also hard to position it the right way so that it would stay in place.  They did do a re-design a few years ago to make it easier to use, but I've never tried it again.
AA10991881	This should help..    By Dr. Michelle P. Warren     If you've experienced menstrual cycles where you bleed at unexpected times, seem to bleed too much, or don't even bleed at all, don't worry, you're not alone. You're just going through something that is actually quite common, an irregular period. These occur in about thirty percent of women who are in their "reproductive years." These are the years when women who are having menstrual periods are capable of becoming pregnant. You may recall being a young teenager (or maybe you are a young teenager) and noticing that your periods were irregular or seemed to take awhile to settle into a "schedule." That's because irregular periods are especially common at the time when menstruation begins in adolescence. A similar syndrome often occurs at the end of the reproductive years when women approach menopause -- usually in the mid-to-late forties. Ironically, a menopausal woman can actually be experiencing periods much like those of her teenage daughter. All women, however, should keep in mind that menstrual cycles may vary normally. The time between bleeding can be as short as 25 days and as long as 42 days. Although an occasional cycle of this length shouldn't be cause for worry, be aware that if cycles continue to be shorter than 25 days or longer than 42, days or are associated with other symptoms, such as pain or heavy bleeding, it's a good idea to consult a doctor. Don't worry, though, if your cycle does not always last exactly 28 days. Just as most women's bodies aren't proportioned to fit exactly into one dress size, very few women have menstrual cycles that last precisely 28 days.     Why do irregular periods even occur? Well, the most common reason that women skip periods is that their bodies have not ovulated during a cycle. Ovulation is the time when the ovary releases an egg. This occurs in the middle of a menstrual cycle. For a variety of reasons, ovulation can sometimes be delayed or even not happen at all. When this happens, your period may be very late or totally absent. To understand how this happens, you need to understand what your period is literally "made of." When you have your period, what your body is doing is shedding the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. The endometrium builds up over the course of the menstrual cycle and receives the signal to shed itself when ovulation occurs and the egg is not fertilized. Heavy bleeding may result if ovulation happens late and more than the usual amount of lining has continued to grow. You may be wondering what keeps the lining from building up when ovulation does occur. The answer lies in a hormone called progesterone, which is made from the ovary. Progesterone acts to stop the growth of the endometrium. The ovary makes progesterone for 14 days, after which the endometrium is shed as a menstrual period. Bet you never realized just how much action goes on in your body in the course of a month!     --------------------------------------...     If you want to get really technical (so you can sound really smart when talking to your girlfriends) you can think about something called a proliferative pattern. This is what happens when your body does not make progesterone and the endometrium builds up so much that it finally outgrows its blood supply. The result is that you have the kind of period in which blood is shed in a disorderly, erratic pattern, and bleeding may last a long time. Although this happens to many women and is quite common, we don't really know what causes it. It's possible that the reason is related to the kind of stress that comes from dieting, rigorous exercise or travel where the body clock is thrown out of whack. Remember this very important point, however. Though there are many reasons that you can miss a period or experience erratic bleeding, it's crucial not to ignore the obvious--that you may be pregnant. If you have a period that's abnormal, make sure to ask yourself if this is a possibility.     Irregular periods are sometimes the result of a hormonal imbalance. How do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance? The best way, of course, is to be evaluated by your doctor. If you continue to have irregular periods for longer than three months, you should probably make an appointment with your gynecologist. You may have one of two types of hormonal problems. The first type happens when you have too much of a certain kind of male hormone. This hormone usually comes from the ovary and occasionally comes from the adrenal gland, which sits in the kidney. Since men do not menstruate (wouldn't it be sweet justice if they did?), too much of this hormone will obviously cause your periods to become irregular or even stop. The second type of hormonal problem occurs when your body literally gets its signals crossed in coordinating the menstrual cycle. This confusion takes place in the brain--where else? And again, if you want to be really brainy about what's going on in your body, think about this: there are three places inside of you where your hormones can be disrupted. These are the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, (both in the brain) and the ovaries (you remember those, they're in the lower abdomen.) What happens is that the hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland, which in turn sends signals to the ovary. These signals are sent from the brain in very specific pulses every 60 to 90 minutes. Since you're reading this on a computer, think of all the signals and connections that must be made just for you to reach this page. Have you ever had trouble logging on to the internet? Well, things are just as complicated inside your body. So it's not all that surprising that circuits misfire from time to time.     --------------------------------------...

I am an opera singer and thus very concerned with the condition of my throat, and I am addicted to this stuff. It feels really nice and is delicious too. A lot of people who don't like tea like this. Beyond that, try milk and yogurt and ice cream. Dairy products make you all mucus-y and that might help soothe your throat. But still try the yogi tea.

8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Yup. I gain a good two or three pounds during PMS week, and I get the diarrhea the day before my period is due. The diarrhea I'm not sure there's anything you can do. Try eating bananas and white rice, that's supposed to be very "binding". Or if you're constipated try a bit of metamucil (a tablespoon in a glass of orange juice at night and you'll be "working" again in the morning. The bloating, I just drink water like it's going out of style. Eventually I pee it all out, usually within a couple hours if I keep it up (small bladder, squashed by 2 pregnancies, so it doesn't take me long). lol But I have heard you can safely take a diurretic for that week (I've seen them on the shelves at the store).|`|AA10991881	Don't eat salty foods and don't drink caffeine.|`|99474240b62d5b9cd6837973ec63cb8daa	Welcome to womanhood!!! ha, ha, Just kidding, you can buy over the counter products that relives bloating, some women prefer pamprin I prefer Midol extra strength.|`|AA10672349	Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale), an excellent diuretic, helps eliminate excess water from the system, relieving the symptoms of bloating.

Note: Although dandelion may relieve the symptoms of bloating, it is important to take an herb such as vitex which will simultaneously be working on a deeper level to rebalance the hormones.|`|cb41d5c23ca37f5dcfa845618b4f9e28aa	DRINK MORE WATER THAN YOU USUALLY DO, AND REDUCE YOUR SALT INTAKE.

You can go for a drive (the car is sometimes a good place to talk because she doesn't have to look at you if she is embarrassed) go to a fast food restaurant and go in, order, sit awhile and listen.  Don't talk, don't ask questions, don't judge, love unconditionally.  Being out in public may help her because she will know you won't go bulistic on her.

Good luck !|`|AA11115231	I do that all the time with guys, even if they're not my bf's. There's 2 reasons why I or any other girl would act like this. First reason, she does it on purpose to get your attention and test you and see if you really care for her. That can also mean that she wants to see your reaction and hopes that you will start begging her and make you worry about her (or even spoil her). The second reason is that she actually wants to tell you something (usually something stupid or non-sense) but makes it a big deal, only to see you get all curious about it or desparate, so that you can keep on asking and spoiling her. I'm sure you've asked yourself "did i do something wrong?" "what's wrong with her?"...etc....and that's exactly what she wants you to do, just giving you a hard time...right?  Also, one last thing, if she or any other girl says "hey you know what?" then dont even bother asking her what she wanted when she answers "nevermind" 'cause it's also another form of creating curiosity just to get their attention. Good luck with her, so yeah...ignore her and she will get more tired of it sooner then you think.|`|cf60e3d68c7ead4a70c536d27140666aaa	I think its because she is jsut shy if not give her a present to cheer her up!|`|AA10991881	She doesn't want to tell you because it is personal, and she may not think that you care.|`|f2bcd1555cfbbb0c194a4ee409ad334aaa	cuz she dont want u to worry or maybe its too personal?|`|31938bbb266329db7c1c844b806cee8eaa	Because she wants you to beg and beg and beg until finally it's more your problem than hers, and then she 'helps you out' by giving you a little tidbit of your problem (which is really hers).|`|194ffcf914c58e0ef10b30e271d535f0aa	Maybe its something that you have done or shes afraid to tell you.

Miscarriages can be serious and you should be seen by a doctor.  If the miscarriage is incomplete (if all of the tissue is not shed naturally) then you may need a procedure done to make sure that you don't get an infection.  You really should go to the doctor.

If you know your blood type and are negative, such as 0- you will need some medication to prevent antibodies. But moreso than that, they will need to see if things are progressing normally. Early miscarriages don't always release completely and you may have tissue left in your uterus. I have had 3 miscarriages this year and I know that was always a concern for my doctor. And remember there is patient/doctor confidentiality so your parents need not to know at this time and  your doctor is forbidden to tell them. But you need to go as soon as possible. Good luck.

I hope you celebrate by doing something fun and hope you enjoy it, remember it is only as good or as bad as you make it :o)    I had my period at around 13 years old, for me it was definite blood and the feeling of being wet that initially made me look, but for some girls it can be just brown discharge. I just put some toilet paper around my panties, told my friend all about it on the way home from school, and asked my mother for a tampon when I got home.    I started with tampons straight away, but I wish I had started with cups straight away, I'd highly suggest looking at all your options not just tampons or pads, particularly as commercial pads are bad for vaginal health, environmentally harmful and very expensive  most girls seem to start off with pads.     You might want to ask your mother or an older female in your family for help, and start having a look at different web sites about what happens during your period, different options and how to tell your mother or how to celebrate your period, here are some sites for you to visit;    http://www.scarleteen.com  http://www.debuinc.com  http://www.celebrategirls.com  http://www.puberty101.com  http://www.myvag.net  http://www.youngwomenshealth.org    Some different menstrual options to consider;    Commercial tampons  e.g. Tampax  Organic tampons  e.g. Natracare  Soft tampons  e.g. Gynotex  Sponge tampons  e.g. Jade & Pearl  Homemade tampons  Padettes  Commercial pads  e.g. Always  Organic pads  e.g. Natracare  Cloth pads  e.g. Lunapads  Homemade pads  Padded panties  e.g. Lunapanties  Rubber bell-shaped menstrual cups  e.g. Keeper  Silicone bell-shaped menstrual cups  e.g. Divacup  Soft plastic softcups  e.g. Instead  Homemade menstrual cups  Diaphragms as menstrual cups  Free-flow  Free-flow layering  Free-flow instinctive   Period blankets  Extraction  Others|`|29ae5ded3b8c7790827d33fde1b7d069aa	i got mine at 14, and i used pads.

Pads are best until you have some activity (swimming, camping, etc) that would be hindered or dampened by not using tampons.  You should keep using whatever you use for a day or two after the blood flow stops, just in case.    It looks mostly like you've got blood in your undies. Sometimes there'll be dark clots (normal), rust-brown blood (normal) or a thick, egg-white consistency fluid (normal unless its green or smelly).  Hydrogen peroxide and cold water will get most bloodstains out if you're quick about it.  Oxy-Clean will get rid of the rest.  Good luck!|`|5cf8c943de70d07f504f43b200becc5daa	Okay, I am 12 and got it 1st time the beggining of this month. You should use pads until your mom tells you you can use tampons. I use pads.

I know its hard, do it however you wish but you need to tell someone!|`|AA10991881	I got my period when I was 13 and I used pads for the first 2 years. This is because you need to find out how heavy your flow is and what size tampon you should get. Remember, when you choose a tampon you have to choose the smallest absorbency for your flow. This helps give you a lesser chance of getting TSS.|`|1b13552ab0efaab5427528c310cd8d9baa	I started getting my period when I was 13. Until I went on artificial birth control, my menstrual fluid varied from clumpy/ clotty, to very liquidy, reddish to brown. When I went on bc, which I am no longer on now, I had a 4 day period, VERY light flow, and it was very thin and liquidy. It really depends on your body and your natural menstrual flow.     As far as pads and tampons are concerned, I always hated pads because they were messy and uncomfortable. I used to wear tampons all the time, until I found an amazing product called the Diva cup. It costs about 30 dollars, but it's reusable and lasts for up to ten years, it saves you money in the long run and is better for the environment because you're not constantly throwing away tampons and pads that are a HUGE source of polution. It sounds a little funky, but I've been using it and I love it!!! It collects the fluid, rather than absorbs it so you can leave it in longer than a tampon.     You're young yet, so I suggest having a chat with a trusted female relative and just going with the flow... literally. It'll all get easier! Trust me!|`|ff2d54c59b465992297d0d4cca00ba8aaa	try a pad for ur 1st few periods then u can try to use tampons but u might not like them some people dont|`|AA12012486	today at 2:00, i prefer tampons so it get shoved up der innit, and looks like tomato soup|`|cafc155f5f9dac70baad4ad71ba427e4aa	I would talk to a mom or doctor for real advice on this.

60c4ff178509bcf46255ee345e0cb5a5aa	Judging from the majority of answers to your question, youll notice,they say the same thing and I have to repeat it again, you'll achieve your goal of losing weight thru a well balanced diet (80% alkaline foods meaning fruits/vegetables and 20% acidic foods daily), regular exercise (three/four times weekly 30 minutes each), and drinking 8 glasses of water daily. However, I'll go one step further to show you the best and quickest way to lose weight so that your entire system will achieve a balanced pH and not be depleted of the essential minerals that it needs.  Here's why.  As the typical American diet is mainly acidic, except for most fruits and vegetables, it is close to impossible for our body to attain the alkaline levels that spells good health without the proper nutrients. This being the case, it is very difficult to lose weight unless you monitor closely your body's pH. Let me explain.   An acid pH has considerable influence over the majority of weight problems, including Diabetes and Obesity. It seems that a habitually acid pH can directly cause immediate weight gain. Here's what happens when a system is too acid. A condition known as Insulin Sensitivity or Syndrome X results, which forces too much insulin to be produced, and the body is flooded with insulin so that it won't waste any calories, it diligently converts every calorie it can into fat.  It is thought that an acid pH immediately signals the powerful genetic response to an impending famine, directly interacting with the all important and very sensitive, Insulin- Glucagons Axis. This makes the body produce more insulin than usual, and in turn, produce more fat and store it. In general, the more insulin is available to the body, the higher the probability that fat will be produced and stored, rather than used and burned as energy.  Thus, an acid pH will probably alert the genetic response to famine, directing more insulin to be produced and storing more fat than usual. Conversely, a healthy, slightly alkaline pH, will be more likely to yield normal fat burning metabolic activity, making no demands on the body to overly produce insulin and make fat, allowing fat-weight to be burned and naturally lost. And, with a healthy pH, there's less likely to be any yo-yo effect, or rebounding from a diet with additional weight gain. As long as nutritional stores are maintained, a healthy, slightly alkaline pH allows fat to burn normally for energy, rather than being hoarded under the mistaken biochemical belief of an impending famine.  The best way, though, to drink 8 glass of water daily is to mix it with Xtreme X2O, a natural and organic, coral calcium with 70 trace minerals, which transforms the pH of the water beverage to 9.9 (highly alkaline)!  You may ask why not just drink plain water? The answer is: When you drink lots of water, all of 8 glasses daily, it does not have the essential minerals (calcium, magnesium with 70 trace minerals) that your body needs to elevate its pH and therefore, alkalize your body as the pH of plain water is rather low and very acidic (pH     If you would like to know what your pH level is, let me know.

South Beach, Atkins, Weight Watchers; it doesn't matter.  They ALL come down to that same basic principal.      If you are running for an hour every day, then you clearly are getting plenty of exercise, so it's eating you need to look at.  The common sense things are common sense for a reason-they work.  Drink lots of water.  Avoid soft drinks and caffienated beverages.  Make the bulk of your diet fresh fruits and vegetables.  You need to keep your protein up, with the level of exercise you are doing, so eat your meats (unless your a veg, then eat your legumes), but avoid sauces and things that will add fat.  NO fried food.  Sweets in moderation (maybe once a week).|`|7d0deb88f5b695328beb6cffa2faa0e1aa	I just lost 30 lbs on the Cambridge diet, which is much like Slimfast only cheaper and it's designed for long term use. I look and feel fantastic and like knowing that my body is receiving 100% of it's daily vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It's inexpensive too.  No pills.  It comes in the form of soups, shakes and oats (as oatmeal or to cook with).  It's been around for over 30 years and is FDA approved.     Southbeach is also excellent.  I wasn't losing weight at the rate I'd wanted though and just had a baby last year so my metabolism was "freaky slow" so Southbeach didn't work well for me.  I tried Atkins and had immediate success with it, however, I'm hypoglycemic and found that my blood sugars were not well controlled.  I felt sick the entire time I was on the diet. I'm just not a big meat eater either.  I like a little, but prefer my veggies.  Ultimately I chose Cambridge because  1- I could lose weight fast. I'm in impatient person and I need fast results to stick with anything. LOL!   2- I asked my doctor to research it and even though it's a low calorie diet she was impressed with the nutritional content and told me to "go for it" and  3- it's affordable.  I'm a stay at home mom and we're a one income family.  I needed something cheap.  and finally   4- the Cambridge Diet has a strong support system to help you on your weight loss journey.  They also have a "refeeding" program when you're ready to come off the diet to help ensure you do not gain the weight back and that you develop a new relationship with food.  Sorry, I'm a fan of Southbeach even though it didn't work for me.  I'm a fan of Atkins for the people who like the foods it offers but I'm not a fan of Slimfast.

I would highly recommend picking up the beginning tapes and giving it a try!  Excellent workout!|`|AA11124885	If you are talking about toe tap abdominal exercises then HECK YES!  My abs have responded very well.  This is when you lie on your back bracing your arms straight toward your legs (against the floor).  Then lift your knees up so that your lower legs are parallel to the floor.  Lower one pointed toe to the floor counting a slow 1-2-3-4 then count slow 1-2-3-4- back up.  Repeat each leg 6 times.  This really helps firm up lower abdominal muscles.  Try to crunch your belly button to your spine the whole time.  Relax your shoulders if you can.  Before putting both feet down at the end, bring your heels to your bottom, relaxing your knees.  This will help prevent back strain.  It's hard as a bugger at first, but after a few days you'll feel a difference.

I finally found something natural that works. First, I wash my face with tea tree oil soap that I got from Trader Joe's - it's all natural and very gentle and non-drying. Then, I pour some witch hazel onto a cotton round and rub that all over my face. Once that drys a bit, I do the same thing with pure tea tree oil. I let that sink in for a couple of minutes and then rub some mink oil into my face (or jojoba oil, sweet almond oil,  or even extra virgin olive oil will work)The trick is just to use a very little bit - it keeps the skin moist without blocking pores. If you really are against using the oils (but you shouldn't knock it if you don't try it), you can use 100% pure aloe gel. It's important to do ALL of those steps every evening.    In the morning, I'll usually just use the cleanser, the witch hazel, and then some organic, all natural moisturizing cream.     Try and keep your hands off of your face as much as possible - that means no picking or popping pimples! If you use a washcloth on your face, change it every day. Change your pillow case every day too. If you use a cell phone, rub some rubbing alcohol over the ear piece every day.     Using all of those steps, my face cleared up within 2 weeks, and my skin has never looked better! As a plus, all of that natural stuff is loads cheaper than the chemical crap!

Symptoms include the following:        * Itching and burning in the vagina and around the vulva (the skin that surrounds your vagina)      * A white vaginal discharge that may look like cottage cheese      * Pain during sexual intercourse      * Swelling of the vulva    Yeast infections are so common that 3/4 of women will have one at some time in their lives. Half of all women have more than one infection in their lives. If you have symptoms of a yeast infection, your doctor will probably want to talk to you about your symptoms and examine you to make sure a yeast infection is the cause.      How are these infections treated?    Yeast infections are usually treated with medicine that you put into your vagina. This medicine may be a cream that you insert in your vagina with a special applicator, or it may be a suppository that you put into your vagina and allow to dissolve on its own. Medicine in a cream form can also be put on your vulva to help relieve itching. Medicine in a pill form that you take by mouth is also available.|`|bd76a3496ec762eb424cf31a844d90d3aa	you really should see a doctor, yeast infections don't feel like a hammer smacking you. yes there is itching and burning, are there a excretions that are yellow or green anything werid? my best bet is to see a gyno right away it could be dangerous|`|AA12342090	You need to go and see the doctor.

It is because I am usually in a hurry.  I want to finish caiming before I have to go in and have sex.  I usually caim outside, when the sun is bright, because that gives the best caiming light.  However, sometimes I caim on the road, because as you come around a corner, you just have to stop and caim.  I have caimed in the rain too, but my hat was driping in my eyes the whole time, so I try not to caim when it is wet out now.  In all cases, I usually caim fast, because it is not my favorite thing to do.  I would rather be eating, drinking or having sex.  If I have to caim, I like doing it with a dog.  They just sit and watch, and sometimes they scratch at the dirt like they want to caim themselves.  I showed the postman how I caim, and he said I should get a real job.  However, the butcher was impressed, and said he should caim some more too.  I saw two people caiming on a hilltop yesterday, but only one seemed like it was a good idea.  The other seemed like caiming was a waste of time, and she would rather be reking.  But that is a whole other story!|`|AA10779756	remember mind over body|`|AA11198742	cuz ur a horny bastard

Manic depression, nowadays, is called "Bipolar disorder."  It involves mood swings from depression to a state called mania.  Where depression is a "down," mania is an "up."  Mania potentially involves racing thoughts, euphoria, irritation, rapid speech, a high level of energy and creativity....and if it gets too "high," there can potentially be delusions.

Permanent sense of anxiety.     Sensation of utter despair, hopelessness or uselessness of everything.     Irritability and physical exhaustion.

Most breast lumps are not cancerous. Yet the most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast. Often, the lump is painless. Other signs can include: a swelling of part of the breast, a clear or bloody discharge from the nipple, nipple pain or the nipple turning inward, redness or pitting of the breast skin (like the skin of an orange), a change in size or contour of the breast, any flattening or indentation of the breast skin.      How is breast cancer found?   Mammogram: It is currently recommended that women age 40 and older have a mammogram every year.  Clinical breast exam: Women in their 20s and 30s should have a breast exam by a health professional as part of their regular exam, preferably every three years. After age 40 women should have a breast exam by a health professional every year.  Breast awareness and self-exam: If a woman does a regular monthly breast self-exam she can more easily notice changes and report those to her doctor right away.     Because of the great strides in early detection and treatment there are more than 2 million women LIVING in the United States today who have been treated for breast cancer.  Women still need to do their part to be in charge of their health.  It begins with awareness, followed by regular screenings.

AA11096432	My ideas? Try to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. Work hard, but don't over 60 minutes at a time. Do planks and other abs exercises on alternate days.    On training days, do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.    Read magazines like Shape, Womens Fitness, Fitness, etc to get tips and to stay motivated.    Good luck and stick at it.

Getting rid of  fat in general, building lean muscle, and defining your physique is 60% diet, 30% exercise, and 10% mental thought. You must eat the right foods, exercise more often than you don't, burn more calories than you consume, think and speak positively about yourself, try making life as stress free as possible, and get rest so that your body can repair itself.    Portion control is key to reaching your goal. You don't want to over-eat. A portion should be the size of your fist. Meals should consist of one portion of carbohydrates and protein, and a portion of fat (is: a handful).     Carbohydrates:   Apples, Bananas, Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Mangos, Pineapple, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Celery, Carrots, Broccoli, Asparagus, Green Beans, Sweet Potatoes, Corn,   Steel Cut Oatmeal, Whole "Grain" Bread.    Protein: Egg Whites, Salmon, Tuna, Halibut, Chicken Breasts, Lean Ground Turkey, Turkey Breasts, Protein Powder, Protein Bars (Power Crunch Bar, Cliff Builder Bar) You don't want a high calorie, high fat, high sugar bar. The two I listed are good ones, and they taste great too!    Fat: Organic Peanut Butter, "Raw" Almonds or Walnuts, Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. (Only consume a handful of nuts, with your breakfast, lunch, and dinner.) Fats help with digestion.    You want to have 4-5 small meals per day. 2-3 hours apart. You will never go hungry and your metabolism will not slow down!Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed. If possible get 8 hours of sleep, this plays a major role in losing belly fat.    Meal Planning: (Preparation is key.)    Meal 1: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 2: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 3: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 4: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 5: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)    Drink half of your weight (or more) in oz. of water per day.  (ex: 120lbs = drink 60oz. of water per day.)    Exercise: (Arrange this plan to fit your schedule).    Mon- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Tue- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Wed- light weights lower body, 20-30 min cardio, and abs  Thu- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Fri- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Sat- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)    Its important to sign up to a gym, perhaps get a workout partner/personal trainer it offers motivation.     This is my plan that I have made after doing research.It has worked for me, and I've helped friends lose weight this way! If you stick with it, it eventually becomes a lifestyle. If you are going to eat junk food, do it in moderation. Eventually you won't even crave it.I like to keep my diet as natural and organic as possible.

In addition to that three tablets of brewers yeast thrice a day and cinnamon or negative calorie drinks on alternative days could help you.it should be fine if you alternate your eating habbits say for example you could treat your self  once or twice  a week and boost your metabolism or alternate it by eating healthy and eating good amount next day ...I don't know why you are not keen on exercising but 20 minutes of brisk walking and 20 minutes of rope jumping can keep you in the best of your help .regards|`|ce5ab99303c2ca1782aff6f0eda73f37aa	Burn more calories than you eat.

A man would then have control over the life of a woman. If you told me as a man that I must do what you require, then most likely I would tell you were to go or blow you away. We cannot expect more of a woman than a man would naturally give.    Further you may check out this link http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/dna/a... where you will find that the contribution of the male is destroyed in the creation of the fetus and that it lives on the body of the female.

SErhF1OSaa	It is absolutely possible and more even probable.  Yes, Seroquel has a half life of 6hours, which means it should be out of your system in 6hrs.  However, medications act differently for EVERYONE!  There are many side-effects that do not show up in nursing/drug books.  You need to look at a PDR and PDR update for things that happened in case studies, that did not happen often enough to make the drug books.    Congrats  on losing some weight.  All of your hard work will pay off now.  A good rule of thumb that I was taught was that your body does not fully release the medicine effects for at least 6 weeks after stopping.  Just like when you start some meds it takes 4-6wks for that to take affect.     Good Luck  Momma P|`|vRxx6Oegaa	No idea, quetiapine (Seroquel) has a half life of 6 hours.

pfm0wcEIaa	You need to do some simple exercises and stretches.  What is wrong is that the muscles that pull on your knee are not balanced properly.    First, start off easy by moving your leg really slowly and figuring out how to use your muscles so it doesn't hurt.  Second, keep practicing this when you walk, run or whatever.  You have to really focus.  If you can't continue doing the exercise without your knee hurting you are just going to have to stop.  Third, practice stretching the muscles at play by doing plie's (as in ballet).  Do the stretches whenever you are waiting in line.    After a week are so you should start seeing results.    Biking is said to be also helpful.  It is all about reconditioning those muscles that pull on your knee...|`|3emS6MDmaa	I would, it could be a lot of problems.

The second time you have sex it is more comfortable and it only gets better from there (depending on the guy you get) don't worry about it, Just imagine all the girls that do go through it the first time. If it hurts so bad, not many people would be having sex for the first time for a LONG LONG time. -=) everyone would wait for marriage.

His penis size, If you have ever used Max tampons, Have you been fingered?? Have you ever had a pap smear? All of these things not only stretch out your vaginal opening, but gets you used to the sensation of something being inserted into your vagina. For me it didn't hurt as much as my mother lead me to believe, But he was half asian so....Lol. He had a smaller penis so I really only felt slight discomfort. But i had never used a tampon in my life, never douched, never been finger, so something entering my vagina was a whole new experience!

Just make sure when you do that you tell him to take it slow and relax your muscles even if you're nervous.|`|JAKbLgpFaa	it didn't hurt me at all! i already had experience with tampons and being fingered, so that probably prepared me. if you're all tensed up and nervous then you won't get properly lubricated and it'll hurt more as you stretch. but like you said, everybody's different!|`|ZUeTIFGWaa	yeah it will hurt but if you are really relaxed and actually care for the person, and really want to do it, then it should be fine. don't do anything you're not ready to do just because.. wait until the right time and person and after a while it will start feeling REALLY good... good luck ( i don't mean go and try it good luck, but be careful and smart good luck) : ]|`|2f4de3c4028381592f2c0f6fd84aff06aa	Oh, yeah.

MQJ8w56Qaa	I am only 54 and I was just diagnosed with osteoporosis during my first Bone Density Scan. My bone density is much less than women my age hence my diagnosis. Most women do not see this lack of density until 65-85 years old.    After much research, I believe my early age osteoporosis is due to the fact that I did not get enough calcium most of my life so after age 30 or so, I started losing bone.  Also, I had a thyroid problem in the past and that may have also contributed to the osteoporosis.    Other factors that contribute to osteoporosis beside the lack of calcium and vit.D are...  1. smoking  2. excessive alcohol use (more than 2 drinks per day)  3. some prescription drugs  4. some health problems    I am now on 1500 mg of calcium, 800 iu Vit.D, per day.  I must increase my weight bearing activity to 30 mins per day  that includes, walking, dancing, aerobics, other low impact exercises.  Also adding light free-weight training, while protecting my back and hips from premature breakage.  http://www.health.com/health/library/top...  There are many websites with all the info you will need to make sure you do not end up in the position I am in.  Act now, do not wait. Find out what you should do calcium-wise, exercise-wise and diet-wise, pertaining to your age.|`|5sHcB4wuaa	yes milk will help a little, but exercise is the best way to help prevent it.

gu1eJ5bXaa	Some part of the adhesive holding the metal wire in place or the metal wire itself is irritating your tongue. You probably now have an ulcer on your tongue and you need to see a dentist / hygienist to get the retainer looked at if the ulcer does not heal up. This usually takes 10 - 14 days depending on the size of the ulcer. Use something like Bonjela on the sore bit for this time. If it doesn't go away after 2 weeks see your dentist.|`|dNFe6FiEaa	doc??

In order to have a correct bite, All of your teeth (including the molars - the ones in the back) have to align properly. You can't just straighten the front teeth. A lot of times people do not realize this and as a result, do not realize how much their teeth need straightening. It is a long process for anyone. Minimum 1.5 - maximum depends on the person. I wore braces for a total of five years (headgear, the whole nine yards), then retainers for two. Only an orthodontist can answer how long, which then answers how much (it depends on your treatment and needs).  Invisalign is a possibilty, your orthodontist can tell you if that is the right treatment for you. Typically, it is recommended for children around the ages of 7 - 9 to have an orthodontic examination. They can tell early on through various means (ex - x-rays) whether or not treatment is needed and when is the best time to start. They can also sometimes begin what is called preventitive treatment. My son is 9 years old and has had braces on his upper teeth for over a year now, will have them removed in a month. This has helped with crowding and allowing new permanent teeth come in a little closer to where they should be. In other words, now is the time for an evaluation. There is also the matter of wisdom teeth you will need to consider soon - they may need to be removed before treatment can begin.  The initial placement is the most uncomfortable, and sometimes adjustments (changing wires, making bends in the wires, etc) can cause discomfort. Tylenol or Motrin usually helps with this.  Foods to avoid are sticky foods - gum, taffy, caramel, etc. - stick to your bands. Hard things like popcorn kernnels, jawbreakers, etc. - these can pop brackets loose and bend wires. And soda is really a no no too.  The acid can cause the cement to breakdown and weaken the enamel around the brackets. If you choose to drink it, rinse with water after.  The main thing is to be careful when you eat.   Hope I helped.|`|AA12327015	My daughter got braces last year and they were $6000.  She eats mostly what she wants. After an adjustment they're sore for a couple of days.   She'll probably wear them 18 months to 2 years.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	My teeth were about the same exact way as you describe.  But I couldn't get over my front teeth being crooked so I finally just went through with it.  Mine were about $6200.  I will have them on about 18 months before I get them off.  Good luck.|`|k16dVbV6aa	It's best to get braces when you are young because you're teeth are still shifting....you can eat anything but somethings are not recommended like gum.....I had braces about 7 years ago and they were around 2 to 3000 dollars....usually you wear them for 2 years.....invisalign is a good alternative if you don't want people to see them and it does work.....prolly cost as much or more as regular braces...they are painful at times due to the fact that they're shifting your teeth around....retainers come after braces in order to keep your teeth straight not in order to straighten them....hope i answered your question.|`|LGuvF2j3aa	normally you would have to wear braces for two years,concidering your teeth arnt that bad..maybe a year to half a year at the least. Invisalign might work..i would talk to your otho about this. and braces normally cost around $4000.  foods you cant eat  no popcorn-hulls get caught in teeth  to sugar gum-sugarless is good  no pop- unless you wash your teeth right after  no crunch things  no carmels or taffys  and no eating whole apples or carrots, dice them up first    hope this helps :)|`|hNHaNPeuaa	first of all where i live braces cost 4K. My dad has the max insurance for healthcare so they only cost 2K. Generally on the whole your looking at 1.5-2 years for braces. Yes the retainer comes after you have woren braces for a few years. No all those things are gimicks. Yes in the beginning they are painful well at least in my case. I took ibprofen for the first week. They also hurt after you get them tightened. Pretty much they say you can`t eat all these foods but i did anyway. Just don`t bite into sucks and other hard foods and you should be fine.
UBDvmDeuaa	Very simple, effective tip. You won't need to buy any product.  Further you will feel the difference in 2 days time, and it depends on the intensity of the yellowishness. No sideeffects as well as no magic. you will only need to repeat to have a permanent effect.    In addition to brushing up your teeth with your regular paste and brush you can do the following.    Well if you don't brush no problem, still follow the following tip.    Buy a soft toothbrush in the size that suits your mouth. (it has to be really soft thats all)  buy baking soda  (Baking soda - Sodium Bicarbonate  IUPAC Name carbonic acid   CAS Number 144-55-8   Chemical Formula CH2O3)  buy common table salt.(Sodium chloride NaCl) Iodised salt is also ok.    Now mix 2 pinches of baking soda with one pinch of table salt. mix with your finger and hold it in your palm. Now use your softbrush and brush your teeth gently with this powder.    Brush with this preparation twice daily as long as you want. within days your teeth will become whiter and shining. Stop it once you find it is enough. From then on just brush regularly with your favourite paste and mouth wash.    Well reduce or stop smoking and also stop using tobacco and pan items. Rinse your mouth after every meal. Eat lots of fibre food, fruits and milk. Drink plenty of water to maintain good oral health.      Don't brush too hard to hurt your gums. Do not swallow the powder(no major complication will occur just drink water if you swallow).|`|Z2xiWhGraa	Hi    I answered this question yesterday for someone else.

5Ks0VpzGaa	The plaque Index, is the number of teeth's surface with bacterial plaque. If you use a manual toothbrush and your goal is to achieve a 0% plaque index you will spend between 15 and 20 minutes each time you brush your teeth (if you brush 3 times a day you will spend almost a hour brushing your teeth). On the other hand, if you use a good spin toothbrush you will get the same result with a 2 minutes use. So, if you brush your teeth 3 times a day, you only need 6 minutes to reach a excellent result.|`|cfcuBxdsaa	yes try the spin brush by crest it's relatively cheap and it works.

So then  I went through two weeks of  physical therapy to try & alleviate the pain, & it worked for 2 days, I ended up  having to have to have them operated on to fix the problem. I feel your pain, & it seems as if nothing you do works. Try laying on your stomach on a flat hard surface , with your arms stretched out as far above your  head as you can , then point your toes & try to stretch your legs as far as you can at the same time slightly  trying  to rise with your abdomen just slightly, repeat that  a few times. It helps  a little but it work permanently. Chances are you will need  to see a physician, & see what is recommended for treatment  for this.   The stretch I told you to do was one I had  to  do  doing my physical therapy,  the object is to cause the spine to be fully extended & allow the disc to to slightly move off the sciatic nerve, & relieve  the pressure & pain.  It is very temporary , but gives a little relief. Good Luck , & please  seek real Medical advise, Because I really know  no one can live even 1/4  normally with that pain*  EDIT: I just  saw your  addition, about being in therapy,  the only thing left is  surgery , if that is  not working, & believe me I was good for 12 years after I had it & it was worth every penny it cost, but it has returned, but only occasionally, & the stretch usually relieves  it

NKurMFuTaa	MRI tests are extremely accurate for the diagnosis of something like an ACL tear. Physicians are typically able to diagnose torn ACL's about 90% of the time from a medical history and by manipulating the leg and performing the Lachmann Test. With the MRI test, his confidence is just going to be that much greater in the diagnosis. Wait until it heals to play on the knee again. Knees are always finicky, and there's the potential to do way too much damage if you continue pushing it while it's hurt.

Maybe you are trying too hard? Why go out of your way to be such a great person? Who are you doing it for? For others? Then it won't  happen. You have to be who you are: Like who you are and that starts with yourself. If you don't like how you act sometimes then change it.  If you are shy then be more open. The worst thing that will happen is someone won't talk to you or want to be your friend.  Most people worry so much about the people they go to school with? But in reality after school rarely do you stay in touch.  School is just one phase of your life. It is important don't get me wrong. Your education. But how you look or dress really isn't that important but it should be to you. If you like how you look, that's the only person you should ever have to please. Trust me you can't please everyone in this life. Because some will think your pretty some may not. Some may think you are smart and some may not. Get the idea.  Be true to yourself. My sister gave me this advice quite a few years ago. Be true to yourself. Please yourself first. I mean enjoy your own self. Then when it comes to others you won't have any trouble talking to them or being shy.But I do think that all teens go through shyness. I think it's a natural part of growing up. Depending on their parents and their family life. One of my own children is shy. But the other two are not. They are people persons. You may not be a person that needs to surround herself with others. But for some reason you think you do? I 'm not sure what else to say. But you do lack self confidence. I tried to tell you before that if you like yourself then others probably will too. Don't be so hard on yourself either. Go to school tomorrow and just try having fun! Don't try so hard to be someone's friend. Just go through your day. Smile; talk if you feel like you want to; but don't if you do not feel like it.  Be good to yourself. Love yourself just a little more. And do what I suggested look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself what you want to see happen in your life. Your reflection just might agree:)
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I didn't have an impacted tooth, but the Dr. told me that those can be more complicated which is why they recommend you have your wisdom teeth out before that happens.  To get it out they generally have to break the tooth and pull out the pieces which can get complicated.  My brother had one but he came out of it fine.  Lots of people get dry sockets, impacted teeth or not, and its usually because they didn't follow the Dr.s orders exactly.  (usually its because they ate too early.  I b8tched and whined because I was starving but my Mom wouldn't give me anything except chicken broth for 24hrs.)  None of my brothers or myself got dry sockets.  If you have someone take good care of you after surgery you will have minimal discomfort and side effects.  Hopefully your Mom will be cool like mine; she set a kitchen timer to come up to my room every half hour to turn my head while I was passed out and alternately ice each side of my face all day long while I was passed out.  (result:  no swelling, no bruising)As for numbness, I think your x-ray will give you a better idea of what you're dealing with as far as if your tooth is impeding on any nerves.  Don't fear though, your surgeon will go over every detail with you and answer every question you can think of and even some you don't think of.  I'm glad I made you feel a bit better!  Honestly I was so freaked out because I've never had surgery or been put under before.  But the last thing I remember is the medicine making me feel pleasantly drunk and I just laid back in the chair and enjoyed it, and then I woke up and tried to go back to sleep but the nurse grabbed my hand and said, no no no honey you need to wake up so you can go home.  Then I just slept all day long.  It wasn't bad at all.  Aside from being hungry and not being able to eat :)|`|ri87Ihymaa	I had my left wisdom tooth pulled when I was twenty one.

The honest thing is my left wisdom tooth was well after maybe two weeks. Hope I can say the same for my right .

JYHlPczxaa	There are thousands of breakfast cereals. All the featured cereals below are high in fiber, have no hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup, and are low in fat. Here are the best choices for healthy weight loss:       1. Oatmeal - Choose plain oatmeal and add your own toppings. For the best of the best, opt for organic oatmeal. Supercharge your oatmeal with sliced bananas, blueberries, cinnamon, strawberries, nuts, and a little stevia for sweetness.       2. Kashi Nuggets - A blend of seven whole grains, malted barley, and sesame. This cereal is really crunchy and satisfying. It's also very low in sugar with only 3 grams per serving. Jazz it up with your favorite berries. It can even be heated in the microwave on cold mornings.       3. Barbara's Shredded Oats - Main ingredients are whole grain oats and whole wheat. A little high in sugar at 12 grams per serving, but a nice treat once in a while.       4. Cascadian Farm Multi-grain Squares - Like Wheat Chex, only better because they're organic and contain no preservatives or other chemicals. Low in sugar at 4 grams per serving and they taste great.       5. Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola - Flaxseed is the only plant source of Omega-3's, clinically proven to help prevent heart disease. This granola's main ingredients are a mixture of organic whole grains including oats, wheat, and brown rice. Unlike most granolas, it's not high in fat.       6.

It loosens up the muscles to ease the pain.|`|fZkjD0Ycaa	masturbate!|`|VQQtlUnLaa	The reason why you are sore is that when you work a muscle, certain acids are produced in the causing, pain, or the burn. These acids are actually bad for your body, so what your body does is it sends water to your mucles to wash away these acids. It is important never to over work any muscles, and always to drink lots of water prior,during,and after a workout.  THE BEST thing you can do is drink lots of water throught the day,and tommorow, try to rest as much as possibe, and you should feel better shortly. If you desire not to feel the pain then try using some atomic balm(highly recomended, or some bengay. Have someone masage it into your skin, this will also make you feel better. You could also hit up the spa, but brink a very large water bottle with you since you will be sweating out fluids.

Usually after I work out hard?...I go use the whirlpool to go and relax my good sore muscles anyways....maybe you should try doing the same.

However, tiredness and fatigue are strong symptoms of Hepatitis C.  You may want to check with your doctor and have a blood test done.

The most common situation was once termed "the tired housewife syndrome." Many young and middle aged women come to the doctor's office complaining of fatigue and requesting tests for anemia or thyroid problems. Many adult women are mildly iron deficient and thyroid problems may cause fatigue, but it is very unusual for one of these condition to be the cause of fatigue. In most cases, fatigue is more closely related to boredom, unhappiness, some disappointment, or just plain hard work. The patient should consider these possibilities before consulting the doctor. Vitamins are rarely helpful, but in moderation they don't hurt. And good luck.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	please make a blood test for the sugar and iron you may be having deficiency of iron   or your sugar level need to look after best of luck

FDA Proposes Hydroquinone Ban  Medical Author: Melissa Conrad Stoppler, MD  Medical Editor: Jay W. Marks, MD     On August 29, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a ban on over-the-counter sales of cosmetic products containing hydroquinone, a skin-bleaching (lightening) ingredient. According to the FDA, approximately 65 companies sell over 200 different types of skin-lightening products containing hydroquinone in the U.S. Currently, products that contain up to 2 percent hydroquinone may be sold in the U.S. without a prescription, and prescription skin-lightening products may contain up to 4 percent hydroquinone. Examples of prescription products containing hydroquinone are Lustra, Tri-Luma, and EpiQuin Micro.     Hydroquinone products are popular for their skin-lightening properties in Asian and African cosmetics markets. In the U.S., they also are marketed for reducing age spots and blemishes.    The reason cited for the proposed ban is that studies in rodents show "some evidence" that hydroquinone may act as a carcinogen or cancer-causing chemical, although its cancer-causing properties have yet to be proved in humans. Hydroquinone also has been linked with the medical condition known as ochronosis in which the skin becomes dark and thick. Dome-shaped yellowish spots and grayish-brown spots also are observed in ochronosis among black women and men in South Africa, Britain, and the U.S. Ochronosis has been observed in conjunction with hydroquinone use even in persons who have used hydroquinone-containing cosmetics for a short time. Some studies also report abnormal function of the adrenal glands and high levels of mercury in people who have used hydroquinone-containing cosmetics. For these reasons, hydroquinone has already been banned in Japan, the European Union, and Australia.    Any skin-lightening products containing hydroquinone would be considered new drugs, according to the proposed FDA regulations. The products would require FDA approval before being sold to the public and would only be available with a doctor's prescription.    Following the proposed ban, a four-month comment period is in effect regarding the proposed changes in regulations during which time physicians, skin care companies, and consumers may voice their opinions and concerns about the proposed ban. It is not yet known if and when the proposed ban would take effect.|`|VjBciucZaa	OMG DUDE NEVER BLEACH YOUR FACE    um just where cream prevent getting darker buy going in the sun if your pretty skinny gain some weight let your skin strecth and eat healthy|`|sqNsOIzkaa	Stop before you turn into Michael Jackson!|`|vylNTi0faa	I think you should set yourself on fire
ZW8OFvCDaa	Go to the doctor. Just because you go to the doctor it doesnt mean youll be made "even fatter". The doctor will be able to guide you to see someone to give you proper help and they will help you to get back to eating regularly. It doesnt have to be fatty foods you eat, theyll encourage you to eat a  healthy diet which will not only make your body more healthy, but your mind too. Go see a doctor though before you become seriously ill|`|ijh4ycL2aa	I think you may be anorexic, honey.  You're not fat and you know it.  And even if you don't know it, that's extra reason to get help.  Doctors will take you seriously, they deal with this stuff everyday.  They'll take you MORE seriously, in fact, if you describe to them what you've just described to us.  If you think you're fat and you're BMI is so low, they will NOT hesitate to help you.  Just be prepared for the help they try to GIVE you in the process to recovery... :(  Good luck.  You really are in my thoughts, as is everyone who comes to Y/A with this type of question, because I know how they feel.|`|Eug52iQDaa	You do have a problem, sweetie.  You do need to go to the doctor and do exactly what they tell you to do.  No one wants to make you fat.  They want you to be healthy.  If you keep going like this, you are endangering your life.  Talk to your parents about going to a doctor please.|`|K2icX1Ozaa	stop counting calories. this could be a really serious problem you need to talk to you mom. if you go to the doctor youre not going to get fatter, youll be healthier.  you can lose weight a better way by exercising.  but honestly, i had a phase where food sounded disgusting to me. so i would only eat really plain things for the longest time. like sourdough bread or fruit. i got over it by myself but you definitely need to talk to your mom and shell help you  youre not the only person in the world who feels fat, lots of people do but most of them handle it in a better way|`|z36j8rmRaa	Seek help, sweety.  You are NOT fat, but there's no way you will believe me.  What ever your pain is, I can't help you.  I wish I could.  I can pray that the Lord will help you seek Him.  Other than that, there is nothing I can do.  Please stop killing yourself slowly and go to the doctor.  The things you feel and see now are temporary.  Life changes all the time.  Stick around and see some more of it, wont you?    Here's to hoping you will seek Christ for help.    Blessings!|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	You know exactly whats wrong with you because you've asked this in the mental health section and not general health. I suspect you've asked because your seeking some form of attention. My advice would be not to ask questions you already know the answer to and to eat more.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	What do you want help with ?    You are Bulimic with Anorexic tendencies.     It is not only yourself that you are hurting. Others around you are suffering too.     I have strong suspicions that my girlfriend is anorexic and it hurts. I worry about her every day. She is pushing me away and I don't know what to do. It's not a nice feeling at-all. Do you know what the worst thing is ? She sees my ( naturally very underweight ) little sister as inspiration. She can not seem to grasp the concept that there is a difference between having a fast metabolism and practically starving yourself.     On that note, my sisters B.M.I is only slightly lower then as yours and I can assure you that you are not fat in the slightest. You are noticeably underweight.    Do you know how dangerous what you are doing is ? Are you aware of the damage you are doing to your body ?     I don't mean to scare you but you could potentially drop dead at any moment. A lot of the damaged caused by purging is internal so it is not unusual for it to go unnoticed until it is too late.    Just take a moment to think about what you are doing. Is this really the type of life you want to live ?
AJxl0IvHaa	yes, ask her to go to a dentist.  - whitening by a dentis is pricey... and can burn your  gums!  Just stry the strips...|`|bObtJCAVaa	Whitening by a dentist is COSTLY, I've researched it and it can cost anywhere from $300 to $900! And yes, you should get your teeth cleaned after your braces are taking off. It's best to stick with whitening strips and whitening toothpastes dude. The money isn't worth it if you have to go back year after year.
WSIZKAQcaa	You're bleeding because your gums are irritated from NOT flossing.  It's like physical therapy. It's going to be uncomfortable for awhile but it will strengthen your gums. You're supposed to bring the floss up to your gum line  wrap it around each tooth ( like a C) and move it gently under your gum line. Pull the floss trough, don't drag it back down.  Do that with each tooth, brush your tongue with your toothbrush and you will have the healthiest mouth on the block.  That's a $75 oral hygiene lesson.  :D|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	only if YOU floss too much, too hard and forever...bleeding gums can come from too much of a good thing or gum problems.|`|M9tH99gfaa	no thats normal...dont worry about it ur gums are just sensitive, flossing is somthing that u should do daily|`|QwKiK85eaa	Yeah especially if you floss so hard your gum bleeds that can mess up them|`|1nINGDC7aa	you should do with proper technique. if while doing flossing you put too much pressure on the gumsor go to deep it can injure the gums. for more informaton on proper flossing you should visit the following link  http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|VZPvTKZOaa	Flossing can not injure you. However if you start to bleed it means your gums are weak. (don't worry its fairly common, it happens to me too) Chewing gum is a way to help strengthen your gum.|`|05aKFYl5aa	if your gum bleeds it probably means the floss hit against your gum really hard. nothing big.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	If you have never flossed your teeth your gums will bleed, because your gums arent used to it. They will become tougher as time goes on. Did you learn how to floss properly? Because it is important to do it properly. Here is some info on that: http://www.expertvillage.com/video/7551_...|`|R0M1WCmZaa	Yes it's can..my fiancee never use it I told him that he should do that he said no because it' hurt him a lots, he use mouth wash.... and I does same thing when I was floss my teeth as hard it's bleeding & it's became little sore..then next day it's fine... just be careful and try do it easy....|`|yazZH4khaa	Mnay times when the gums bleed that means that possible infection is coming out. That is a good thing. Keep flossing and the bleeding will eventually stop, except when it needs to bleed. Use mouthwash after you floss.|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Gums bleeding with flossing is the classic "gingivitis" red flag.  The gums are bleeding because there is infection that never gets cleaned out.  As you continue to floss, the bleeding will diminish, then stop and the swelling that happens when you first start flossing will go away.  Aggressive flossing with floss that's poorly adapted to contours can cause floss cuts.  Just floss thoroughly and carefully and the bleeding will go away|`|HqCiJht7aa	NO, That happens to me too, you aren't supposed to hit the gums, the purpse of flossing is clean the part of the teeth that you cant get with your toothbrush(sides). And helps to clean your teeth even more. just dont hit ur gums with it.And flossing actually helps you to live longer believe it or not.Scientist said it relieves inflammation in ur gums, which in turn helps you to live longer.|`|tMdXnnRQaa	They are bleeding  because they are inflammed....keep flossing daily until they don't bleed.|`|8tWub9HMaa	no. the only reason your gums are doing that is because you have not flossed before. there's prolly junk stuck up in there, and the fact that your actually trying to get it out is irritating your gums. flossing is GREAT for you, eventually over time your gums will not bleed anymore. i floss mine twice, if not more a day, to get all the food out. it helps with bad breath too, because basically, if you don't floss you get rotting food stuck in your teeth and yea....that's nasty lol|`|JmPInfKQaa	Not if done correctly. I'm assuming you've never really flossed before and people who start will experience that.|`|JttazGgjaa	* you injured yourself* you need to have someone show you how to do it properly.|`|T0W13CKvaa	If you haven't flossed in a while (or in your case never), some bleeding is natural for a few weeks.  Think of it like your hands getting blisters, the soft skin builds up more protection.  Continue flossing daily and the bleeding will subside.
9iOHAC41aa	He does sound like a creep. If you don't want to go to the principal then your best bet is just going to be to stay away from him. Although, if you were to turn him in at some point and time, you wouldn't have to worry about the media, because since your a minor they can't legally put you in the paper or on the news without consent of both you and your parents.    Hopefully this will help in some way. When i was 14, also a freshman in high school, i had been moved to a new foster home on a military base (i grew up in foster care) and the foster dad always gave me a creepy kind of vibe too, for the first few months. About 2 months after i moved in, he started molesting me. I decided not to tell because i didn't think anyone would believe me, with him having been in the military for 20 years and all. So i just put up with it, pretended like i was completely fine, but always tried to find an excuse to not be left at home alone with him. Well, not long after that, maybe 3 months later, we had another girl move in, she was 12. It didn't occur to me that he was going after her too, since there were 2 other girls besides me in the house before she moved in and he hadn't ever tried anything with them. Unfortunately, one night i went looking for her when it was just the 3 of us home, and when i found her, well lets just say it was probably one of the wosrt things i've ever seen in my life. I was so angry with him, not because of what he was doing to me, but because of what he was doing to her. I had grown up around those kinds of things and i could handle it when it was just me, but when i saw him touching her i lost it. It was then that i decided that something had to be done, no matter who believed it or who heard about it, becuase he took away that little girls innocence. We are still friends today 6 years later, and she still cries at night. And i felt guilty for not having noticed it sooner.    Anyways, we ended up going to court, because after they did the 2 rape kits and heard both of our testimonies, there was so much evidence against him that he would of been dumb not to plead guilty. Which he did, and he was charged with 2 counts of rape (because for some reason if it was only with 2 people, no matter how many times he raped either of them it only counted as one charge) 2 counts of indecent acts, 2 counts of child molestation, and 1 count of child pornography. I was also worried that everyone would find out, i was embarrassed, i felt humiliated, but when it was finally put in the news paper, not oncedid it give even the slightest inkling of who those 12 and 14 year old girls were. That was all it said was a 12 years old girl and a 14 year old girl. So lucky for me the only person who figured it out was my over observant math teacher, and she was pretty nice about it. She noticed just by looking at the days i had been out of school and she knew it was me. She enever asked who the other girl was, she just said she was sorry i had to be put through it at such a young age, and that even though she was my math teacher, if i ever wanted to talk about anything she'd be there to listen.    I guess what i'm trying to say is that it might seem like a scary thought, but if things ever get too far, don't be afraid to tell someone. You never know, you might not be the only one. And i don't know if your anything like me, but for the next 3 years of my life i blamed myself for not doing something about it before she became his next victim. I've realized i'm not to blame now, but i felt terrible about it.    I guess one good thing about it was that to this day, we are still good friends, we concider ourselves sisters. I just don't want you to feel like you can't tell someone, because yea there will be people who don't believe you, but there will also be people who will. And the media will most likely become involved, but they can't say who you are, only who he is and what he did.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	The creepy teacher is probably taking advantage of your "other legal family issues" to keep up his harassment of you, thinking you'll be too scared to defend yourself.  Stalking is illegal in most places, so you and your Mom should contact law enforcement.  If he's doing this to you and gets away with it, he'll do it to someone else.  He probably has done it to someone else before and should be stopped.    Best wishes, you have a hard road ahead but will be glad to do away with him.|`|JAKbLgpFaa	that is disgusting! if you're reading the signs correctly, you could have a pervert on your hands. HOWEVER, he hasn't technically done anything bad! nothing that could get him in trouble, at least. it's just you freaking out. i'd recommend just staying away from him! you did the right thing to drop his class. you told your mom, that's good, too--if he touches you or speaks to you inappropriately, tell her and you can BOTH go to the proper authorities (that'll prove that it's been going on for a while, and she can back you up). don't talk to him, look at him, be in the same room with him if you can help it. give him no reason to speak to you or think about you. be careful! keep yourself safe.|`|upyg70OXaa	Try to transfer schools and make sure the school has no documents of you. Hopefully he doesn't bother you anymore. If he does, you have to tell your mom this. Try reporting to the principal and get him fired. After, SUE HIM FOR .. harrassment. haha.    --good job getting out of the class ! :)|`|OBuzcIDbaa	If it feels wrong, it IS wrong. He does sound creepy. Do your best to stay away from him. It's good that you talked to your mom about it.  If he touches you, you should definitely not only tell your mom, but the principal. He needs to get out of education. Good job on getting out of his class.|`|PSyVB2UDaa	tell someone. he is a freak stalker person it sounds like|`|AZcohhItaa	Ignore him as best as you can, maybe try threating him , only if you know if it will work on him. Ya this is really creepy. If nothing works just switch schools and if he follows you then have no  choice but to bring media in.  Hope this helps.|`|AA12198724	Woah that is ridiculous. You should not have to be in an environment like this. I think you need to confront your mother again and get the school involved. If the media gets involved they will keep your identity hidden since you are a minor but that situation you described could be dangerous. Tell the guidance counselor or a clergy member if you are scared but that is totally out of line and that teacher should have been fired a long time ago if he cant control bodily functions like that while teaching minors. But you need to tell someone immediately like get off the computer right now and tell your mom that your scared to go into class now because of this. Remember its not your fault and you should not be in this environment.|`|KSGfrlffaa	deffinitley tell your principal, or guidance counsolor. i went through something similar last year with a bus driver, and he got fired.

wTmGTmC4aa	There are a number of problems that are in the elbow that affect your arm/hand.  Ulnar Nerve problems, up to and including nerve damage can cause the symptoms you describe.  That said, talk to your MD about a referral to an Upper Extremity Specialist or at the minimum a General Orthopedic Surgeon, for a full evaluation.    I hope this helps.  I have had problems with my Ulnar Nerve and have had the same symptoms you describe.  I have had surgery on both elbows for Ulnar Nerve Entrapment.    Feel better!

It may be RSI (Repetitive strain injury) or may be something else it is always better to be safe than sorry|`|46827e1fada67be5dddf23d61ecc3c2eaa	As a massage therapist, I think it may be tight muscles. You can lose strength in your muscles when they have been tight for a while do to over use or repetitive actions. Also, there is a nerve in the arm that runs near the elbow, that's what hurts when you hit your "funny bone". Tight muscles can aggravate this nerve which causes pain, tingling, numbness, & loss of strength. Try massaging your arm or have someone else do it, see if it loosens up the muscles & helps with the pain. Sleeping on that side will aggravate it even more. Best Wishes!|`|9fc6f749f8c8e3cd4996a73be2b3c538aa	Consult your physician.  There are several problems that can arise with joints, specifically an elbow.   Some of them include "tennis elbow," tendonitis, ulnar nerve entrapment, and dislocation.  If there is nerve damage, there can be a weakening of the forearm and hand.    If the problem is causing enough pain, it is in your best interest to seek medical treatment.  Permanent nerve damage can occur if left untreated.|`|qPDnxTE0aa	Sounds like a case of tennis elbow.

veB7gJYcaa	The brown color that is got by tanning is a much sought-after sign of beauty. Unfortunately, from a medical point of view tanning is nothing but a sign that some damage has occurred to the skin.     But its a catch 22 situation- The only way to really protect your skin is to block out harmful UV rays, but there is no way to get a gorgeous tan unless you expose yourself to these UV rays.     These days there are alternate ways in which you can achieve the tanned look including the sun beds. However, it is thought as these could prove just as harmful in the long run because they too work using UV rays.    Tanning safety - Sunless fake tan     The good news is, there is now an innovative way to acquire a beautiful tanned look without causing your skin any damage. Sunless tanning lotions are a great way of acquiring a tan without the damage inflicted by the rays of the sun. When applied to the skin, these sunless tanning lotions produce a deep tan that is likely to last several days. These self tanning products are safe to use and they are convenient and cheap too. You no longer have to stay out in the sun if you wish to acquire a tan.  ______________________________________...  They have a spray or lotion that works great and you can get your whole body to look great and you will not even need to wear hose .It does a great job and it will not hurt your skin.  Ok Kenzie.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	ANYTIME you deliberately expose yourself to ultra-violet A or B rays, you are causing damage to the cells in your skin.    Do not believe what the tanning parlors tell you about one not causing problems.  UV A or B are going to cause mutations and damage to human skin cells.
zyKZhukQaa	I play soccer too, but CM not goalie, but still...   The first time I sprained my ankle it wasn't too bad, but I was 11 or so, so I was sobbing like an idiot in the middle of the field. Hehe.    But last year (15 yrs old) I got the ball and passed it away one touch, and I was standing in the same position the whole time. A girl on the other team came up really late, apparently ..ehem.. trying to kick the ball about a second too late, and kicked me in the inside of my left ankle. It bent outwards and was the WORST pain of my life. Ahh. freaks me out thinking about it.    Sorry for the story, but I needed to vent. So I'm saying that your pain tolerance is not low. I have a high pain tolerance.. I know from my many other injuries that were much more serious than they felt. But spraining an ankle is awful.    Ow.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I think this is perfectly normal!  I broke my finger just about a month ago and it hurt like crap!  And believe it or not sometimes a sprain can hurt worse than a break, it's possibly.  I think you are ok and as you can take things to temporarly relieve pain, I don't think there's a way to increase pain tolerance :)|`|v3No1uWyaa	I don't know if you can increase your pain tolerance but i did sprain my ankle once and i promise your not wimpy it hurts a lot. If your a goalie you probably have a high pain tolerance any way.

RhPNV1ohaa	For starters deep wounds must be treated differently.  Don't close the wound if you think there is any infection possible but do staunch the bleading with pressure for 15 minutes or less.  Get medical help.      Do not use full strength household hydrogen peroxide to cleanse the would because that strength will eat fine body tissues.  You can use a diluted mix of 50% water and 50% hydrogen peroxide to cleanse the wound.    The person will need stiches at the least and surgery depending after the wound is cleansed.  Pine Sap can fill wound voids and keep the wound from scaring if you have some available.    God bless you as you prepare for the worst.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Same as you would for a smaller cut but it would need something to hold the wound shut. This is really impossible to answer because in a large wound you might cut an artery and be unable to stop the flow of blood. It is more a matter of where the wound is and it's depth, than the size.     Any large woulds should be treated with antiseptics and a tetanus booster if a person has not had one in five years. A wound can be super glued together as it is done in surgery and works. I would suggest after doing first aid to get the patient to a doctor.

86f01b7199a751642da50fd260cdd3ceaa	Avoid using it as much as possible (I know that's hard to do with a baby).  Tennis elbow is actually a form of tendonitis.  You can ice it when it first flares up.  That takes the swelling away (you will feel heat in that area if it is swollen).  You can also try combo therapy - heat and ice.  Place ice on it for 5 minutes, place heat on it for five minutes, and repeat for 30 minutes.  If done correctly it should feel like needles in your elbow when you first switch.  It helps the tendons heal quickly.  You have to rest the elbow too.|`|AA10991881	Tennis elbow is a inflammation of the tendons(tendinitis) that is by your elbow, and moves over the bone. That is the thing that makes it hurt. There is nothing that you can do but ice it 3 times a day for 20 minutes and that is to keep the tendon from inflaming. What ever you do don't put heat on where it hurts. That will inflame the tendon and make it hurt really bad! I play tennis and I had it last year. Just don't play tennis or do whatever you did to get it. I know that you want to take painkillers to take the pain away but if you do that you can hurt it even more because you can't feel the pain that you are inflicting onto your elbow and end up hurting yourself even more.
ec73ac9c7004d5e38f3886ed42e6116baa	Fasting is the same thing as starving yourself.  Starving yourself is not healthy.      "It is important to understand what happens when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet. When you skip a meal your metabolism slows to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores, and any weight loss comes mostly from water and muscle."      Look under the heading, "Eat Frequently," on this page:    http://www.caloriesperhour.com/tutorial_...|`|AA10774601	Fasting is a prettier term for starving yourself, but it is for religious reasons.|`|AA10715286	yea, they both are not eating.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	Her s/s based on what your saying are consistent with hypotension my best guess would be she's dehydrated and needs some fluid replacement.  Here's a wiki paste to provide you some more info.       Reduced blood volume, called hypovolemia, is the most common mechanism producing hypotension. This can result from hemorrhage, or blood loss; insufficient fluid intake, as in starvation; or excessive fluid losses from diarrhea or vomiting. Hypovolemia is often induced by excessive use of diuretics. Other medications can produce hypotension by different mechanisms.    Decreased cardiac output despite normal blood volume, due to severe congestive heart failure, large myocardial infarction, or bradycardia, often produces hypotension and can rapidly progress to cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmias often result in hypotension by this mechanism. Beta blockers can cause hypotension both by slowing the heart rate and by decreasing the pumping ability of the heart muscle. Varieties of meditation and/or other mental-physiological disciplines can create temporary hypotension effects, as well, and should not be considered unusual.    Excessive vasodilation, or insufficient constriction of the resistance blood vessels (mostly arterioles), causes hypotension. This can be due to decreased sympathetic nervous system output or to increased parasympathetic activity occurring as a consequence of injury to the brain or spinal cord or of dysautonomia, an intrinsic abnormality in autonomic system functioning. Excessive vasodilation can also result from sepsis, acidosis, or medications, such as nitrate preparations, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor inhibitors or ACE inhibitors. Many anesthetic agents and techniques, including spinal anesthesia and most inhalational agents, produce significant vasodilation.|`|bFKjV7U5aa	Take her to a different doctor.

EMNwWAuvaa	Jeff, for you it is a win win situation.  You win if the therapy helps and no surgery is necessary and you will win if you do have the procedure.  The therapy will strengthen the leg before the procedure and that will make the rehab and recovery that much easier.  The therapist is going to have to work on certain specific things such as strengthening the hamstrings and calf muscles.  The stronger that they are the better the recovery.  If you do have the surgery my own preference is to use a cadaver for most surgeons harvest tendon from the hamstrings.  That group is the muscular stop for the knee before the ACL has to stop the movement.  So to me anything that potentially makes that group weaker is a potential problem down the road.  I would also work on strengthening the opposite leg for multiple reasons.  The first is going to be more difficult to understand in that the more work you do on it the more the affected leg will actually get stronger.  The other is that the uninjured leg is going to have to take a lot of stress until you are able to walk normally so the stronger it is the better to withstand the stress.  As for the ligament if the tear is at 40% or greater I would definitely go with the procedure as many things could happen to the knee that would not impact on it well.  Still the two months prior therapy will only help not hurt.
CLcGxHpAaa	Impacted wisdom teeth?  They will try to surface, which causes them to push against your other molars, which causes inflammation and pain.  This cycle will continue.  See the link below...|`|f6ZFjatlaa	they will push on your teeth, crowding them and making them crooked as well as they can break the teeth they are pushing on.|`|87pV5lvZaa	Typically dentists will recommend that you have them removed, because they could cause problems in the future if not.  Impacted teeth can decay under the skin when you are much older (40+) and cause gum or even bone problems.  Also, a cyst can sometimes form around the roots of an impacted tooth, but this is very rare.    It is actually not true that horizontal wisdom teeth with move your other teeth, causing them to crowd.  I have asked both my dentist and orthodontist this question, as I have the same problem as you.  According to them, your other teeth are already "anchored," thus a wisdom tooth's growth will not cause them to shift.    Just a side note: Dentists recommend having your wisdom teeth removed before 27 years of age.  After this age, the roots begin to graft to your jaw bone and can be very difficult and painful to extract.
BrkYgd1naa	It's possible, I lost 5 lbs in 2 weeks.  The one word that everyone is starting to say that you should do, if you're going to be on a diet is "obey".  Obey the diet plan that you set up, if not, it will never happen.  Don't "cheat" on a meal either, find something that you can eat with low calories and fat grams that you can snack on if you get hungry.  Drink green tea as well, it helps boost your metabolism.  Treadmills aren't really that great, if you're gonna walk, then walk!  Crunches are good, but don't stop there, your body needs more exercises if you want to lose weight.  Stretch every morning too.  Hope that helps.  EDIT - I just weighed myself again and I have lost 5 more pounds..|`|JYHlPczxaa	Easy (and Sexy) Ways to Lose 50 Pounds a Year      Exercise for 15-20 minutes. If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.|`|kDshEkXraa	To begin with you are on the low end of normal weight as it is, why do you want to lose weight when you aren't remotely overweight?  I think eating that little isn't healthy, especially when you work out.  If you are serious about this you might be at risk of developing an eating disorder.      For one thing doing an hour of interval training on the treadmill is probably burning around 700 calories in itself.  And i calculated your BMR to be 1452 (this is the calories you would burn if you didn't move all day, so just what it takes to survive).  Doing your daily activities like walking, sitting, typing even burns more calories, so just to guestimate on you assuming you work out moderately for an hour in a day you will burn about 2,300-2,400 calories.  Eating 1,300 a day while burning this many would mean you would lose a pound every 2.5-3 days or so which isn't healthy unless you are at a super morbid obese starting point.    I read your other questions and understand you want a flat stomach.  This is very hard if not imposible to achieve for some women.  Your best bet is not necessarily in losing weight but in losing fat and adding toned muscle.  If you continue to work out my suggestion would be the best way to achieve your goal is to run 30 minuets of intervals and do 30 minuets of strenght training.  As opposed to simple crunches do planks and weight bearing core work to bring out the muscle.  Work out every other day or every third day, but make sure you get at least 2 rest days in a week so that your body can build muscle. Eat 1800-2000 calories a day, BUT eat healthy foods no crap, salads, lean protien, fish, rice, fresh fruit, yogurt, and 1-2% milk.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	It ultimately depends on what's causing those chest pains.  If you only notice it while working out your chest then yes as you become more and more use to working out it'll be harder and harder to tear the muscles down which will result in reduced pain and faster recovery.

tI1NHwfBaa	A condom is not 100% effective against the transmission of any sexually transmitted disease.  For diseases like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, the Centers for Disease Control says they reduce the risk by about 50%.    The fact that the condom you used ripped means that you essentially had unprotected sex.    You need to be examined by a doctor.  Some diseases like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea can cause irreversible damage to your body, and can eventually become pelvic inflammatory disease.  If you have one of these, you need to be on an antibiotic.    You wouldn't get a rash from touching the genitals of a man with either of these diseases.  The infection would be inside his body, and would be transmitted to you through bodily fluids during sex.

The "line between your pecs" that you're thinking of is just a result of extra muscle definition; your best chance is, just for one week (since I know excersizes can be hard to stick to), go as all out as you can doing chest workouts; simply benching whatever feels like a relative challenge for you, lifting dumbells, doing push-ups if nothing else... the "line" you speak of is really not too hard to develop, even in one week.
mhLaOFZRaa	If you look in your telephone book you will probably find a specialist that can get rid of them. We have a vein clinic in our area and a Specialist that does other things along with spider veins. She also uses lasers but its probably according to where the spider veins are located.  Sometimes it is covered by insurance but sometimes not as many times it is considered cosmetic problem.     My sister had it done on her legs and they just used tiny needles and injected saline (salt) solution into each tiny spider vein and they then disappear. She said it didn't hurt it was just a tiny sting. She didn't have to wrap her legs or do anything and wasn't told to walk (You only do those things for VARICOSE VEINS which are the deep veins that stick out or look like lumps on your legs when you have them)    I also have spider veins and I was told by someone that I should dip a cloth in warmed vinegar and put it on the veins for about 15 minutes as that would make them disappear after a few weeks. I have way to many spider veins all over my thighs and legs to try this so I haven't bothered. I would try it if I just had a few patches.    I was also told to take Vitamin E by mouth and to rub Vitamin E on the area as that would thin the blood out in that area and cause them to disappear. I have thin blood already so can't use Vitamin E, but if I didn't I would try it.   (CAUTION- I would try rubbing a tiny amount of the Vitamin E on the inside of one of your wrist for 24 hours to make sure you aren't allergic to it before rubbing it on your veins as a few people are allergic to Vitamin E. If you notice redness, swelling, itching or blisters on your wrist, then you are allergic and shouldn't use it and should wash it off with soap and water, dry the area and apply an over the counter antibiotic cream)    I am much much older than you and I have so many spider veins that I haven't worn a swin suit in years and I love the water and live near the beach, so when I have the money I do want to have my veins done.    Good luck and hope some of these ideas work for you.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	spider veins like that are hereditary, and you can't do anything to get rid of them, you have to see a vascular surgeon that can inject them and make them go away.|`|DXh2BlCraa	Spider veins cannot be removed through surgery. Sometimes, they disappear when the larger varicose veins feeding the spider veins are removed. The remaining spider veins also can be treated with "sclerotherapy, this is a non-surgical procedure." "Sclerotherapy" uses a fine needle to inject a solution directly into the vein. This solution irritates the lining of the vein, causing inflammation which blocks the flow of blood.     After the solution is injected, the vein's surrounding tissue is generally wrapped in compression bandages for several days, causing the vein walls to stick together. The vein turns into scar tissue that fades from view. Patients whose legs have been treated are put on walking regimens, which improves circulation and prevents blood clots. This method has been used since the 1920's. Laser treatments are very effective for treating the smallest, less than one millimeter, spider veins, especially on the face.    In most cases, more than one treatment session will be required, because these procedures only treat those veins that are currently visible. Because venous disease is typically progressive, no treatment can prevent the appearance of new veins from surfacing in the future. There are many factors which will affect the rate at which treated veins recur.

One of mine was deeper in the jaw bone, so more force was needed to dig it out. (I had a knot in my cheek for a couple of weeks as a result.) Therefore, I believe it will be less painful because yours are more exposed and accessible.    The bleeding lasts about a day or two, and in my case, the meds did not help. You'll be woozy for an hour or two after as well.    Best of luck, though.
OhyEivqbaa	Wow, yeah after all of that treatment and pain I would have expected him to tell you all the possibilities of the treatment... however I think this is a bit more on the oral surgeon than the orthodontist since he did not actually do the work. The oral surgeon should have had you sign some sort of consent form stating that the treatment may or may not work (since that's what they always say)... The orthodontist did suggest the treatment and say you needed it done, however he did not actually preform the treatment so I would talk to both doctors and see exactly what all was signed before the procedure.    Best of luck to you, I know this can be very frustrating.

A good and healthy relationship is something that builds up over time. To me you are indicating this by allowing each other to do their own things as well. THis is an excellent way to commence relationship. If your symptoms were the reverse, you or him won't allow each other to have space and need to explain every time your out with someone. the relationship would be classified as unhealthy. Just a warning of concern. maybe you need to seperate the situation. Who ever did this to you in the past owns your symptoms of abandonment, not you. Try to keep reminding yourself (overpowering the previous abuser) that he cares about you and wants to be with you.     Whilst he is feeling this way towards you allow yourself to be happy. What things do you do - to stop just thinking about him. Surely you have significant others that are just as important to you (e.g. friends an faimily). This is where borderlines have problems - they have a tendency to depend on one person only and when the relationship stops they full apart completely. This is a dangerous way of thinking being dependant on one person alone, is not healthy for him or you. Try to remember life is journey you will meet people all your life but not everyone will be there till the end, even boyfriends.

It is all a matter of educated opinion of a psychiatrist based on what he observes and what the patient tells him/her. They (the public) say a schizophrenic does not realize he/she is mentally ill. I disagree; I knew from the start that something was wrong and suspected schizophrenia. Voices so loud in your mind that they force you to your knees and aparitions that no one else can see are not normal to most people. There are several types of schizophrenia. Try "schizophrenia" in a Yahoo web search to find out more about the symptoms that a doctor looks for to diagnose.    It is also common that a patient after being on meds for awhile feels so good he/she thinks the meds are not necessary and dumps them with disastrous results usually. As for the side effects it is a trade off between them and the symptoms of the disease as to which is worse. You have to decide which way you want to go. Recall what you were like right before you were diagnosed and given pills and ask yourself, "Do I want to be like that again?"    As for education, I went to two universities after I was diagnosed as a schizophrenic and while on med's. and was able to work a full time job most of my life. You are a very negative personality; negative thinking in my opinion, is what causes depression. Look up "positive thinking techniques" in a yahoo web search and follow some of the sugested ways to break out of the negative thinking habit found in the many links that come up.    Hope this helps.

Some people are not as diligent with brushing and their only defense against bad oral health is fluoride.  Having bad teeth can effect the rest of the body.  It can cause inflammation of the arteries leading to a higher probability of heart attack or stroke.  A woman with bad teeth, plaque, mouth infections is a lot more likely (almost twice as likely) to have a miscarriage.      We just need to educate people so they will take better care of their teeth so that way we can keep fluoride out of the water supply.  Unfortunately people are lazy.
AA10093415	Yes, it is bad to wait longer. My dentist told me it is best to get your wisdom teeth removed sooner because the tooth will not have developed intricate roots or nerves. This completely makes sense, so it won't hurt as much. It also makes sense because the tooth will be smaller; therefore, it will be easier to remove.     If your tooth has already grown some, it will have developed deeper roots and nerves. Therefore, it will be more painful to remove. If you don't get your tooth removed though, you might have problems with crowding. (The wisdom teeth will push your other teeth together to make room.)    Unless all the damage has been done by your wisdom teeth, you need to get them removed as soon as you can.     I hope this answer helped some! And good luck.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	they knock you out lol.

It hasnt affected mine. it depends on how they grow in. My husbands gre in crooked and are pushing his teeth out and making them all wierd, but it just depends on the teeth and the person.  They just knock you out, go in and cut them out. it does hurt after for awhile, but after that its no biggie.|`|60mDEusiaa	I was put under sedation for my wisdom teeth removal. You need someone to wait in the waiting room and drive you home, at least. Really, the worst part was that I had an infection in one of my holes, and I had to get medicine for it and more pain medication. I was given an iv and then some medicine, and  I went out as my boyfriend left the room.I was scared though... The next thing I remember was being woken up and taken to the recovery room. Your cheeks will be swollen. Pudding is your best friend and the medicine they give you. The best time to do it is Friday. If you have to work, take of Friday and Monday, and you should be fine. I only had one hole bother me and I went to my regular dentist and he prescribed me antibiotics and more pain meds and I was fine.
z0HvIqNjaa	First of all, your teeth start out as buds and grow and develop inside the bone; as they grow roots, they begin to erupt, and are held in a socket (the area where the tooth developed, its like a vertical hole). As they erupt, they break through the gum tissue. This is why you have the "flappy skin" as you called it. If the tooth cannot erupt properly, it can become impacted - sometimes these impacted teeth can become infected. This is common with wisdom teeth. A lot of people simply do not have the room for them, the wisdom teeth can cause crowding with your other teeth. As far as the difficulty of the surgery itself? There are many factors that determine how the procedure goes. As long as none of your wisdom teeth are impacted, things will probably go a little smoother. However, sometimes the roots of the teeth fuse to the bone, this can create problems with the roots breaking and then the dentist has to surgically remove the root tips. And, simply due to the location of the wisdom teeth, they are more difficult to reach - this makes it difficult to get leverage as they lift the tooth out. So, by having them removed before they are fully developed teeth is usually easier. If they are removed as buds, you simply open the gum tissue, maybe cut away some bone and lift it right out, instead of dealing with fully developed teeth with roots. You are right about this affecting your other teeth, as I stated above. My suggestion is you take the time to have this taken care of. See an Oral Surgeon as opposed to a general dentist. Good luck!|`|wRLidVqkaa	Please do it before your wisdom tooth has time to attach itself to your jaw. You have to get it checked out now or it can get infected, I have to go have mine out (having an X-Ray Tmorrow) My face is swollen, my jaw is hard to open and it's because of an inpacted (maybe infected) wisdom tooth.    The sooner that you get it out the less painful it will be, the infection may spread to the cheek, throat or neck resulting in pain, swelling and stiffness of the jaws. So please don't put it off, it's really painful when you wait; I know.

sYJ1I5EMaa	Master Esthetician and CEO of GlyMed Plus skin care, Christine Heathman, applies a tinted photo-age pigment protection skin shield to Michelles birthmark. The makeup acts as a second skin and adheres to the non-porous surfaces of the skin, Christine explains.    The makeup contains a high titanium dioxide concentration, which acts as a sun block and helps protect against ultraviolet rays, proven accelerators of the skins aging process. Its like a second skin, Christine adds.     I got that on the doctors website, i hope it helps.
vVfH8yBYaa	As someone who works with cancer patients everyday, the best thing I can say is, don't worry until you know there's something to worry about. What you are describing DOES sound a lot more like the side effects of stress than it does breast cancer (or any other cancer, for that matter.)    I hope things turn out well for you. ...and the mammogram really isn't that bad. Not knowing is much more painful than any test they could ever do.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Breast cancer usually doesn't present with symptoms until well into the progress of the disease.  Breast cancer doesn't itch.    I believe you are very anxious, under a lot of stress, have common muscle spasms.      Relax.  You have a lot on your mind and its getting a little too creative for you right now.  Ask your doc for something to relieve the anxiety.

7jxbpo0Qaa	Perhaps she is afraid to show emotions due to an emotinal trauma.  Pple that show no emotion are called stoic but that in itself doesn't sound like her problem.  For whatever reason, she wants to emotionally detach herself.  Therapy would probably help her if she were to treat it honestly and communicate with her therapist.  Some of these behaviors do sound like attention seeking.  But that in itself is a problem caused by something.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Oh, and I guess you are "perfect" then? Just be happy with ur friend, man what's wrong with these people?!|`|AA10008319	She needs therapy and a sense of responsability for her feelings or actions. Don't let her lay all the bogus onus on you!|`|4oeBAHANaa	she needs to seek help, try to make her realize that. and if she doesn't then you need to help her get help, even if it means putting your freindship in jepoardy because that's what's right if she is to live a normal life and have emotions.  hope I helped you help her get help.|`|mhaxOQ5raa	She just wants attention. You should pinch her till she cries or gets  mad then be like haha you do have emotions.|`|HeJjK8slaa	It sounds to me like she's faking it.

The best thing i can suggest is just try to remain as non judgemental as possible and support her while she goes on her own journey of self discovery, or works out what she needs to.    You could suggest she sees a therapist? She might have a mental health problem. if shes thinking about suicide she could be depressed.|`|P5aO3ebzaa	Well she sounds goth or emo or something. My guess is that she shows "no emotion" because she doesn't want to get hurt or has some family trouble. I think she doesn't want to show that shes hurt for some reason and she doesn't know how to show it so she has "no emotions" she probably does care but i think you shouldn't act like she has a 3rd head or something. just act like she is normal and maybe you'll have a break through. idk that's what i think.

iEVEfPaVaa	If you are talking about post earrings try gently rotating the earrings just a little past comfort 3 times a day.    Every day or two gently pull to see if the post will come out.  You can pull just past comfortable.  Clean the area with rubbing alcohol first but allow the alcohol to dry before turning the earring so it won't hurt so much.  If you still can't get the posts out after a week or so you need to see a doctor about it.  If the earrings are wires and they are imbedded as hard as it sounds I suggest that you do go to the doctors for removal because, unlike posts, you cannot do the gentle turning  and to pull straight out is much harder on your ear and piercing.  Years ago I had my first earrings grow in and my mother gently pulled them loose.  Trust me, there is no way to gently pull out a well healed in earring.
GGqXgYD6aa	well probably yes because we get mail when our son or our daughter they are still under our health insurance plan and want to get out of it but we always get other mail saying like thank you for your visit to what ever hospital or dr's office so hope this helps!|`|fef3832ed001896078d73efd2b54d99eaa	yes everything will be documented there.|`|0XXM4U5Zaa	The Insurance company will have the information, if the appointment is filed under the insurance. Usually a detailed list is not mailed out, but if your parents get a notification for every appointment, and they don't recognize it, they are likely to call the company to ask. As they are the subscribers, the insurance company will have to tell them.  My suggestion, if you are that worried about your parents finding out, go to a free/county clinic, and don't give them your insurance information.|`|CKPMkfvfaa	If your parent is the owner of the insurance policy and your are a dependent of your parents, yes, they can see anything if they request it to the insurance company or to your doctor.The medical bill will show the reason of your visit.|`|z3lqUU2Maa	To Be honest,It will take a little time to find the answer for the question of yours.have a look at the resource here http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...  for your reference .

W2z5dCrmaa	Ladies don't experience the difference as much with a condom, because the condom moves in and out with the male, just like his man parts do, so she doesn't feel much difference, except maybe the texture a little for some really sensitive Ladies.    For the Dude, the condom stays and moves with him, so it's like having a barrier between him and the slippery rubbing over his feeling receptors that he really needs to feel lots, If the condom stayed motionless in the Lady and the Dude slid in and out of it, the disadvantage would be traded to her.    The difference to a Dude in feelings is like vision.. a condom equals trying to see in the dark. Without a condom for a Dude would be feelings wise like being able to see in the daylight.    Don't forget, you still need protection, and that's the difference between unmarried sex, and married sex where you don't use condoms anymore.    Hope that helps for you to understand the difference?

Also if he is unable to work because of his depression he is eligible for Social Security Disability. If he goes to his local Social Security Office and applies he is immediately eligible for a medical card that will take care of all of his medical needs.  He can also go to an emergency room, they will hospitilize him and they will help him start the Social Security Process. If he has been or will be in the hosptal for his depression that is an immediate reason to approve him.  But it takes six months to get the disability check. From the date that he applies until he is approved in six months he will get a check that will be retroactive from the day he applied.  I was unable to work because of depression for a long time and never knew that I was eligible or that there was a such thing as Social Security Disability until a friend told me.

8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.    Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|5sSjx4GXaa	I think you will get taller.

You can paint your fingernails with normal fingernail polish, so when you bite them they'll taste funny. You could also try trimming them as far down as you can so there isn't anything to bite off. I've also heard of a product called "Bite No More" and it's somewhat like fingernail polish but it supposedly tastes DISGUSTING and makes you want to stop biting them immediately.    Or, you could just go old school and try sitting on your hands. That's how I kicked the habit.|`|zp1vBDE4aa	i have the same problem i'm not sure how to stop but i could tell you what i've tried and why it didn't work   1. the finger nail polish that tastes bad- after a few day's i got used to the tast and i was fine with it.  2.fake nails- they kept braking and i found out how to chew through them  there are probably more that i forgot to list but you get the idea but hey if you find out how let me know i've been trying to stop for years!!

9pLdhuBnaa	There are several possibilities for what could be causing this such as something like growing pains (an example only), but I would recommend checking with your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.    However, I would recommend letting your mom know first so that she can help you keep an eye on the situation.
AZcohhItaa	okay it will feel uncomfterable at first for awhile but you will get use to it.  First take it out of the package thingy then open your vagina flaps area.   Look for your whole and point the end up into it and push it all in leaving the smaller end on the end that is out still out. then push this smaller end into the bigger end and you will feel the tampon go into you. Then you pull out the white thing and all that should be left is the little white string that you use to pull it out later.  Hope this helped.|`|iYzJmnqRaa	ok look all you have to do is relax. umm...  in most boxes of tampons there is a set of instructions and if you don't get those then just ask your mom.  as for types to use i would recomend kotex sport plastic
rpnFxnCQaa	Yes, if I were you, I would consult a doctor and take problem at the root.    I had anxiety when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted years and affected my career. At some point, I was prescribed medicine but wanted to avoid that (for other reasons I will not get into). That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that hole. NOW, you should be aware that each case is different. That is why I suggest you also see a doctor to tackle your problem.    Good luck!|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	I agree with Heather|`|ulCN5LJiaa	Although I strongly suggest you find the root cause of your anxiety, an herbal remedy that might help is Kava kava.  It can be found in tea form at Target, a brand called Yogi tea.  Going the herbal route first seems better than jumping straight to whatever medication a doctor would give you to relieve the symptoms of anxiety.  I've been there and those medications can really screw you up.  Chamomile tea has also worked for me, but not to the extent of kava.|`|dnU4xtIQaa	I would check into medications with a psychiatrist. Anti-anxiety meds are actually quite powerful for those who experience anxiety, because anyone with anxiety knows that immediate action is the best action.. I can take a .5 clonazepam (dosages go up to 2 mg) when i feel anxious, and within about 5 minutes my anxiety is gone. After that I would be focused on finding the root cause.
87pV5lvZaa	That depends.  What do you mean by "all the time"?  If this is a daily occurrence and has been going on for months, then it is probably discharge: your vagina's means of self-cleaning.  Discharge would have a faint odor that is slightly musky, but it shouldn't smell "bad," and it definitely is normal.    If this has only been going on for a few days, then you may have a yeast infection.  Is the "white gooey stuff" clumpy?  That would be a sure sign of yeast.  If so, then you can purchase an over-the-counter cure, such as Monistat, for approximately $10 at your local Walgreens.  Also, your doctor could prescribe a yeast infection treatment, such as Diflucan.  Good luck!|`|yJlbJOlNaa	discharge
n7KCez59aa	Hi !     Dry Skin Care     Dry skin is dull, rough, scaly, and itchy, with almost invisible pores. Dry skin is usually caused by an abnormal shedding of cells from the skin's outer layer. In normal situations, lubrication from the body's natural oils helps to prevent water loss from the skin.     If you have dry skin, cleanse your face daily, alternating between soap and water and a cream cleanser and water. This will help prevent your skin from becoming drier. Moisturize with a non-perfumed, non-alcohol-containing lotion after washing.    Also, limit very hot showers, high temperatures, and low humidity, which rob your skin of moisture. Even using soap and excessive washing or scrubbing of the skin increases dryness. Many teens have drier skin during the winter months, when humidity is low and heaters force hot, dry air into enclosed rooms.    If your skin is very dry, take a warm bath for about 20 minutes. Avoid using soap or other drying products. When you get out of the tub, pat your body dry, then rub mineral oil (found at most supermarkets and drugstores) or a non-perfumed, non-alcohol lotion all over your skin. Pat your skin dry again. The oil or lotion helps to lock in healing moisture, keeping skin supple and soft.

Seriously, that's the only way I've ever found that really works. Don't do it for a week and see what happens. Not only will it be the best orgasm ever, but you'll definately see an increase!
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, sometimes the pill can make one hormonal as far as being very moody when first starting out on the pill for some women.  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
UUIqK50Taa	That is a very good question. My fiancee's teeth are already pearly white, but whenever he gets sick they are blindingly white. His parents say that has been happening since he was little. Maybe it has something to do with the body's immune defense mechanism.|`|33ZQARueaa	it might be because your body is trying to clear up any infection and fighting extra hard to get rid of the infection...maybe since you are sick, , your body if trying to fight off any infection that it finds|`|Nkxs6BBEaa	probably the medicine..|`|sCe2FsF0aa	If you are taking antibiotics then that would be what is clearing it up.
D9x1QSgiaa	Apparently so. I'm was always getting the "Evil Eye" from my ex-wife for all kinds of "Naturally Occuring" odors of the human body. Some women are soooooo "prissy" that they whine and complain if a man does something such as fart (quietly), burp or clear your throat. These kinds of odors and sounds have never bothered me...so why are some people so sensitive about it????|`|mquRob1faa	i have a really good sense of smell.   well...this is kind of a gross example, but i was putting the wash in the dryer, and i smelled mildew. i called my mom down and she couldnt smell it. i swore i could smell it, but she told me just to dry it. later, when i was folding it, i pulled out a mildewed sock. i could smell it out of the whole pile.|`|sHLpsJ30aa	yes and no for health reasons a girls nose can sense more pheramones then men but it depends other then that

ZQMjPCDxaa	I would probably rinse the site out with peroxide, apply neosporin, and re-bandage it on a regular basis, probably when you get up in the morning, and before you go to bed at night. I would keep this up for a few days, and if it keeps getting worse or doesn't get any better, I would go see a doctor. Because you're walking on it could be a reason it's so sore, and you seem to be convinced it's minorly infected, which it probably is. It should be fine, but like I said if it persists I would call your doctor and ask for his take on it.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Depending on how you scraped it you'll need a tetanus shot.

It is not easy, but the things that helped me was creating my own ceremony to say my goodbyes, e.g. this allowed me to process that they have moved on. Have you also thought about only allowing yourself to cry on certain days (grievance days). Yes, life is not fair. But why are you being unfair on yourself, of course you are going to have down days (any one would under the same situation), but  if you want control over these down days, then you could consider setting the grievance days.

Listen, your not going to find anyone that promotes suicide here unless they are suicidal themselves and want to take others down with them. So you probably are asking just to find reasons why you shouldnt do it. And really you already know them all. You need to talk to someone immediately about this honey. Your problems are "normal" and temporary at best. If you hated your teacher would you drop out of school? Ofcourse not! In time your situation WILL change. If you cant change it immediately and go live with a relative or friend, you can change it at 18, which I am guessing isnt too far away. Get a cheap apartment with a roomie or 2 to split the bills with and you can do it all with a P/T job & still continue your education if you want to.   You have too many people around you that committed suicide or tried to, try to avoid being around them when you are feeling this way.   Life is an amazing gift, dont take it for granted. You can change the direction of your own life anytime you choose just by changing how you handle a bad or stressfull situation. Dot let it all get to you & try to be more hopeful & optimistic.     GOD BLESS YOU!|`|vXotXl1Laa	Hi there,  I'm not sure what "triggers"  you to think the world would be better without you, but try to find out what that is and talk to someone about it. It may take time to find out what that trigger is, but promise yourself to hang in there until you find it. You just might be amazed at what lies beneath. Good Luck.  Here's something that makes me feel better about myself when I get really down. I do something for someone else: taking the Turnpike to visit family, I paid extra for the car behind me. I cashier at the grocery store, commented on her belt. She smiled from ear to ear while ringing up my purchase. Asking someone their opinion - friend or stranger, the Pizza Shop owner at what he thinks is a good combination for a tasty pizza, a friend if they've rented a good movie lately, someone at Best Buy or Blockbuster what game they would recommend, and why.  My point to all this is turn your focus off yourself. Give yourself permission to stop thinking about yourself and what is going on in your close circle of life for a bit, and focus on something you might not have noticed before. In talking to strangers, you have nothing to loose, you'll probably never see them again, so go for it. You might be amazed at what you can learn, hear, taste, see.   Good Luck and please talk to someone you're comfortable talking to. Don't give up on yourself.|`|Jb8sWxMBaa	i agree with Lilly|`|VhfbYSRVaa	Kill yourself.

Do you sometimes vomit? is the pain at a hungry stomach? or after eating some kinds of food?  Please give us more details.  Could be worms or diabetes or Hepatitis that makes you loose weight, but really difficult to confirm without the details, you should even mention the color of the urine or the Number 2 color, as you do at the doctor's, to really know what you have there.
AA10343094	don't pull with them or mess with them. they will come out when they are good and ready. noodles are fine, they are a soft food, but i would stay away from taffy and hard candies, or even meats like steak and chicken. the stitches feel looser because the swelling has gone down since then. they will fall out in about a week. if they come loose, don't touch them, as that puts you at a very high risk for infection. remember to rinse with salt water at least once a day!    when i had my oral surgery, i tore at least three stitches within twelve hours. i went to my surgeon to have them redone, and he told me it was no big deal, and i shouldn't be worried about it, it won't make it heal any faster, and the majority of the bleeding was done by then!|`|i93KqZ3Kaa	Around half of mine came out within the first 2 days. The rest came out within 3 days after that. It's perfectly normal for them to becoming loose at this point. IT really depends on how active your tongue is.

S730dpLfaa	Kates,  Acai Berry really works but you need to read this blog to avoid scams  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  There are many people around which complain that Acai Berry does not work, but they don't know that they're using fake products!  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|KXhPpteGaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several trials and seeing the results.This is a good website at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|sHmSw0HBaa	Exercise is just as important as food intake when it comes to losing weight, but the sole thing that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today. I lost 30 pounds, it clearly does work!|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|YPAHeUucaa	It's just a berry...even in pill form. It is not dangerous, unless you're allergic. So, try it out!

Rest hand lightly behind head, and lift your shoulders towards the ceiling, head up towards the ceiling. Its not a neck or back pivot, they are not to bend. Then back down slowly.    To get bigger biceps, you need to increase the weight you lift. Look towards doing slower, more controlled curls and start with a small number of reps per set.  To build your muscle for this increased weight, eat some more protein rich foods like eggs, milk, and meat,|`|i9MlY6J3aa	eat lots of protein, and work out with sit ups, crunches, and the ab machine at the gym. hope you get those muscels too! good luck! ;]|`|ENwgrz6zaa	eat more protein like steak and chicken and ensure protein plus!  its quality muscle builiding stuff  and do tae bo and plates|`|O9lTqrbbaa	SIT UPS|`|kDshEkXraa	I actually know this one!

Perfectly good penises come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and teenagers' penises grow at very different rates. They are often curved somewhat, and the skin often has bumps and various colorations (which have nothing to do with STDs).

Average height  2. Normal length. Check below for more info.  3. Depends on the girl. Though read basics for general info about that.  4. Check info on girth below.    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm.

To lose 10 lbs in 5 weeks, you need to lose 2 lbs each week.  This means you need to burn 1000 more cals every day than you consume.  You could eat 1200 cals a day, and do enough exercise to burn 800 cals.  That's pretty extreme, and not the healthiest way to go about losing weight.  I would suggest setting a goal of 1 lb a week, and just take your time.   Please don't consume any less than 1000 cals a day, that's really not healthy, and it wil screw up your metabolism for life.  If you lose weight by not eating enough, you will gain it all back, and more, as soon as you start to eat regularly again.

It will be hard to loose that amount but if you stick to a 1,200 calorie and stick to you should be ok.  Drink plenty of water.  Don't drink juice that is highly concentrated and no coke and stay away from even diet  drinks if you can. Beside Pilate's you might walk or run 20 minutes a day.  I think you can make it even if you don't if you exercise every day you will look good because  your waist and hips should be smaller by then.

j4R5JLBAaa	Yeah Pot is a very potent and it's an illegal substance in US.    Many things been said and many opinions exist about legalizing it or not?    As of right now its still an open , undecided question ( some would wish it would be as simple as Yahoo.Answers;) )    For those of you seeking for new spiritual experiences I would recommend a Legal Herbal Smoking of such herbs as Salvia, Kanna, Wild Dagga, etc;)    More info on topic here: http://www.down-the-pipe.com/pages.php?p...

I started smoking after constantly asking my friends if its bad...but I only smoke about once a month.|`|mdyuUjDxaa	well, it  can atrophy (harden) your brain after three years everyday use.     Men that  I used to know that had smoked weed for 40+ years died of brain cancer. I am linking the longterm marijuana use to that.     I used to smoke weed, and I am glad that I did.     I don't anymore as I have a baby, but I think it is pretty much harmless if you don't smoke it six times a day for forty years.     It takes your body thirty days to clean THC (the oil that couses the high) out of it's system. Green Tea can speed up the process.     People that never clean their bodies out and let the resin just build up, and build up in their lungs & brain are asking to get sick.     But if you smoke it evry once in awhile, It cannot harm you.     I know, I am not dead. anyone else who wants to bash it can go blow Bush.|`|IR0PSCG5aa	NO it is an almost harmless drug(more like plant)  Search side affects of marijuana and you should find a lot of good facts about it.|`|iubLKsuGaa	No, it just makes music,food,fun, and even sex better. It can also help people deal with cancer,alzheimers,hiv?aids and other diseases. It causes no harm to you and there hasn't been one marijuana linked death in history. George Washington,Michael Phelps,Barack Obama,Bill Clinton and many other succesful and famous people have and still use marijuana. Why should something that cures cancer be illegal? IT MAKES SEX FEEL BETTER!!!!

j0JTUiTaaa	Work with your bariatric surgeon for the coverage.  Some insurances won't cover lap band because it is still considered new.  The lap bank is like any weight loss surgery.  It is a tool.  It is not a cure.  It works for some people and not for others.  There are chat rooms you can go to and talk with people who have had it.  I have a friend who did it almost 2 years ago and it has worked very well for her.      My insurance would not cover lap band under any circumstances and I did the roux en-y.     Email me if you have questions.|`|cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my lap band surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!    I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeons recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.

Om9CFRpsaa	If you are having occasional lower stomach pain, then this could be a sign of premenstrual cramping.     For me, the pain is worse some months vs. other months.The discomfort can last up to a week prior to my period and lessens after my period. Ibuprofen usually helps me. Other women prefer Midol    If the pain is bothersome, then your dr. can recommend some alternate meds for you.  Additionally, if the pain gets worse, then you would definitely want to see your doctor to make sure it is not something more serious.

tI1NHwfBaa	Yes, the HIV virus (the virus that causes AIDS) can be transferred through any sexual contact (anal sex, oral sex, or vaginal sex.)      Don't believe anyone who gives you the odds of getting the disease through oral sex.  The CDC is not entirely sure of what those odds are, though in a recent study they identified 8 cases (out of 102) that probably occurred as a result of oral sex.  This figure is only the percentage of cases of the total that were likely transferred via oral sex, and not the actual odds of getting the disease this way.    When you're engaged in sexual activity, you're at risk for catching this virus.  Period.  Condoms can reduce the risk, but the CDC says that a condom only reduces the risk by about 85%.    You're gambling with your life.  Seems to me to be a silly gamble.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	It's a very low chance and it's very rare, but you can get it that way so be careful and use proctection.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	If you honestly have to ask this question you are way too young to be having sex.

That's why they have those dental dam things.  The chances are ~3% if I remember correctly, but if you can't trust your partner to be honest and/or knowledgeable about his/her current status in this regard, then I don't see how you can enjoy having oral sex with that person.

Are you all crazy? Hiv threw oral sex is a theoretical low/zero risk. Theoretical meaning its a theory, but it has never happend.

There are other STD's you put yourself at risk, but HIV isnt one of them.    And to the lady that does HIV testing... How many people have came into your clinic to test because of oral 'risk' and tested positive??   Answer: ZERO, because it hasn't happend.    Always protect yourself wearing a condom for Vaginal/Anal|`|WnQUuQd9aa	Yes, you can.
vVTmJjJDaa	actually, Paxil is prescribed for treating social anxiety disorder far more often than for depression - and it's NEVER used for psychosis - it's an anti-depressant, not an anti-psychotic...    however, if you have social anxiety disorder, chances are great that it will take a long time for your body to adjust to the medication - it is usually given in smaller doses at first - gradually upping it every week or so, and the full beneficial effects oftentimes aren't felt until about 6 weeks after beginning the med...    with that said, Paxil has a whole *lot* of side effects, and many who take it aren't able to handle them, and eventually discontinue the med...even more surprisingly, even if it does work and you can handle the side effects, oftentimes, the med stops working altogether even at it's maximum dose...this usually happens anywhere from 1-3yrs from beginning treatment...    btw, believe it or not, for a lot of individuals with social anxiety disorder, in low doses, *stimulants* are often very effective - the same meds usually prescribed for people with ADD & ADHD....with Adderall XR being  1 on the list.|`|GmGEGqn8aa	I am just gonna tell you right now.

Scaling you can do at a dentist if tartar forms fast.    But no use using hard brushes you will rupture your gums and they will recede on a long run. Gums are sensitive.|`|sgmv6AXnaa	it grows bak by it self dnt worry|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Actually, it doesn't usually grow back.  Sometimes it's sensitive.  They can put a filling in it if it shows too much.  Also, it's been pretty much proven that brushing too hard doesn't cause the problem in about 99% of the cases, but occlusal trauma and/ or braces are a big culprit.  Clenching teeth (occlusal trauma) is responsible for many cases of gum recession.  Another cause is "inadequate attached gingiva" which is too thin of a line of tougher gums right next to the tooth. For those areas, surgery is usually indicated.
e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	The problem with finding a "fair" orthodontist is that the Invisalign company has a set fee for treatment.  The orthodontist can't request a certain number of trays, it's determined by the company.  You should try to go back to the previous orthodontist that did the original treatment. They probably still have your series of models for the Invisalign company.  From the last few models, they should be able to fabricate appliances that you would need to return the teeth to alignment.

jRqXZV6Oaa	HPV can most definitely be spread to oral tissues.  Just do a search on the internet under 'images' for genital warts and you will see pictures of it on lips, roof of mouth, fingers, penis, labia, etc.    Most people with intact immune systems do not ever get warts from catching the virus.  Sometimes you will get a wart and then your body fights down the virus and you will get no future symptoms.  But you will ALWAYS have the virus once you get it.      If in the future, you get AIDS or leukemia or need to take steroids or some other thing that inhibits your immune system, you may see warts start cropping up.    Don't listen to that idiot John T. that answered saying you cannot get it in your mouth.  I am a doctor.  I have seen it.    The good news is that by the age of 30, most people have been exposed to many strains of HPV and ... most people do not have warts, so you probably won't get them either.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Your talking about Human Papillonavirus and/or Herpes 1 either way if she's infected your a good candidate for the infection.

10r8cXezaa	Yes, that is correct.     Without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.  However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about very two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.     Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.      SORRY SO LONG...|`|qQx48XZuaa	yea you might be able to cough up a lung, making more room for your heart to palpitate|`|1d4f066127a4debbe9480a24c479ac16aa	Well a heart attack is when a clo in the heart occurs so if you could unlodge the clot it will go to your brain and cause a stroke.I don't see how couching would effect the clot in the heart.|`|JQjl5obUaa	This sounds like vague and unspecific advice to me (that's a gut reaction).    I can imagine a few situations where this might help though; it would tend to compress plaque in narrowed arteries like a 'balloon treatment".    I think I'd get my advice on such matters from experts rather than a consensus of "laymen", though. The American Heart Association for instance.    I have misgivings in my military mind about suggesting this to soldiers or policemen and such who might be at a higher risk to other conditions they might in confusion, post - injury, assess erroniously as a heart attack. Once, I had an issue where I woke up in our woodshed in pain. I thought I'd had a heart attack it hurt so much. Turns out some  dope dealers had shot me.    So, first thing I'd do is do a 'body check', with aid of another person if possible, especially if your a cop, soldier or any other at risk person.    There is a war on d rugs on even if the politicians do not "push" the issue; and Al Qaida is a d rug distribution network.     Durring the Veit Nam war my family was bombed by the mob, who were taking money from the enemy. I cannot imagine we've spent over a trillion dollars fighting an enemy that can't afford a $500 hit man.    Heck, I've been shot by a guy once who's services were paid for by a greedy woman looking to collect insurance offering up the "untraceable" commodity of sex in the Street, at time of contract shooting. I'd think if Al Qaida can find people that would blow themselves up, in this perverse land there are people it can buy to otherwise kill for / by (bi- ?? ) sex too.    The point is: if you wake up on the ground in pain, you might have been stabbed or shot. Coughing could then lead to opening up of wounds that could then be fatal.    Many ailments persenting themselves as heart attacks can get worse with a quick cough in a hurry. One such ailment is a bleeding ulcer, that has irritated the heart lining with an acid burn. You can easily survive 'heartburn', opening up an ulcer is potentially fatal in extreme cases (such as Houdini's - (sic).    So, in general I'd say you might be right. But in my personal (not professional) opinion it's best to know a bit about the situation, and then act as that situation demands.|`|5YTWIfFdaa	surely that would hurt....................|`|LcCSjFpYaa	i would like kno that 2|`|g5RS83paaa	TruthOrFiction.com has checked with several sources, including the American Heart Association, and none of them recommends relying on this procedure.      The version of the eRumor that has gotten the most circulation on the Internet originated from an article in a newsletter published by a chapter of the Mended Hearts organization, whose members are heart attack survivors.  Mended Hearts has retracted the article.      Doctors say the coughing procedure has been used on limited and experimental occasions with patients experiencing cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat.  Even then, the patients were in the hospital, connected to monitors, and the coughing was used to try to buy a few extra seconds before other, life saving equipment was used.  There aren't any known cases where a person who was alone suffered a heart attack and sustained himself or herself while waiting for paramedics to arrive.   In a true heart attack where the blood supply to the heart is blocked, the "coughing CPR" would not do any good.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Yeah, I think an email about this was circulated awhile back.

vVfH8yBYaa	Treatments won't cause a disease to spread more quickly, but the decision to seek treatment is a very personal decision. It depends on how advanced the cancer is, what benefit they may get from treatment, what the side effects of treatment would be, etc.     For some people, the idea that they might get a few extra months to live is enough. They want the treatment. For others, the idea that those three months will be spent feeling fatigued and burdened by chemo/radiation/doctor visits isn't something they want.    It's not up to us to decide what's best for another person.|`|AA12202402	It depends on what type of cancer what odds of extra time is added and what type of life is going to be added with treatment. Stage four is terminal. And I personally feel that if the quality of life is terrible for the added year etc rather not have it But it is a choice and a inside thing. If they are a fighter they might just need to fight til the end|`|IDgSVPBxaa	A friend of our family who was like a second grandfather to me had stage 4 prostate cancer.  He took care of his wife before she died, and they were raising their grandson.  So he wouldn't take the chemo or radiation until Donnie(the grandson) graduated from high school.  Well by that time he wasn't doing good and was getting worse and worse.  He decided to go ahead with the chemo and by his second treatment he died at the age of 76(i think somewhere in there).  At the end his stage 4 cancer was so bad that the chemo didn't help at all just made him more sick which in turn caused his death.  He had been diagnosed with cancer 4 years prior to his death.  Not to discourage you from treatment, but you wanted an honest answer so here it is.|`|BMEHg4s0aa	it depends on the type,I had stage 4 cll took chemo and now I,m good to go dont need to be retested for 6 mts.|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Like many medical decisions, that's better left to the patient and their doctor.

As far as the results of the treatment, that varies widely by type of cancer, type of treatment, and over all health other wise.  For anyone facing that decision, I suggest they have a consultation apt with their doctor to discuss the specifics of their case and the statistics of their prognosis with as well as without treatment.  From there, you can only make the decision that is right for you and what you feel/want.  The right decision for you may be wrong for someone else, and vice versa.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Depends on a lot of things of course - but if my choice was to live a year normally, or live a year and a half going through chemo and other torture, I would take the first option and go the alternative route.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	It's up to the individual if they want to try for treatments or not. I know a woman who has or had gbm, which is ALWAYS stage 4. She went through chemo and whole brain radiation, as she had several of these tumors. She couldn't feed herself, speak or even walk. She was and still is in a wheelchair, but I saw her and her husband out to dinner a few weeks ago and she's feeding herself and even spoke to me. Her last mri showed only scar tissue where the tumors were. If you want to live, you should always go for treatments.|`|FicyC2TXaa	It depends on the individual cancer and the individual patient.    Stage 4 doesn't necessarily mean imminent death. Yes, it's no longer considered curable; but it can often be managed by treatment, sometimes for years.    I know someone who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer over 7 years ago; the spread was to the bones and was widespread. She's had a lot of treatment, but her cancer is far less widespread than it was when secondary cancer was diagnosed|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Stage 4 does not mean "terminal" in all cancers. Lance Armstrong had Stage 4 testicular cancer and beat it.    It's not common, but it happens.    New treatments are developed each year. Suppose you take the "I'm not going to get treatment," you die, and the next year they come out with a treatment that adds 5 years to most peoples' lives? Think it's improbable? Look up Herceptin.    Treatment does not make cancer spread more quickly. That is an old wives' tale.

BLD9EEWNaa	Just be understanding and flexible, and if she gets into a mood where she's really annoying and argumentative and irritable, do not insult her, because she probably won't forget.  As for her depression, sometimes its really hard to reach a depressed person without help- if they aren't willing to be helped, it can be very difficult.  Try to be with her a lot when she's in that mood- just very near her, but not demanding anything.  Oh, and medication should help stabilize her- does she see a therapist/psychiatrist?  She must have at least once, if she's been diagnosed.  If she isn't now, see if you can convince her to go back.  Just stick by her.  What ever you do, don't do what someone else suggested and abandon her in her "mad hours"- that's when she needs you most.  (Though from what you've said, you really do want to stand by her.

IBAHzqC0aa	Just went through exactly the same with my mother. It's important that you move your MIL to the care home asap. It does not matter what story you tell her about why she is going back to the care home. I know that might sound heartless and you hate to do it, but she will not remember the story the next day anyway. Yes, make sure there is familiar furniture and family photos when you move her in.    Before signing contract with the home, check out any public assistance, private foundation grants through your church, etc., and make sure you understand the rules for Medicaid. Ask the home whether they would keep your MIL as a resident if she went on Medicaid.  MIL will blame someone in the family (for "abandoning" her) each time she gets unhappy at the home; that person will just have to bear it and understand it's a symptom of the disease. Satisfy yourself that the home is a pleasant caring environment and not a hell-hole; if you've done that, you will be peaceful at heart.  The SS will tell you not to visit for a few days, and not to think about taking MIL on an outing for a month or so after move-in.  This hurts too, but the SS is right, it's best for MIL's adjustment.  Good luck.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	How would you feel if that were you?

GBSO1Efraa	Because the size of your hands and feet does not have anything to do with your penis size.  You are born with the size of penis already determined.  Some people with small hands and feet may have small or large penises and somme people with big hands and feet may have a big thing.  That is a myth that if you have big feet and hands, you will have a big penis.  It is a bunch of bull.

lTbE6HHHaa	I really don't have an idea where to start. Maybe good place to start is explaining first where I stand in this whole suicide issue. First off, I am considering suicide for quite good reasons (at least I think so) - I honestly think that people I care for will be better off without me. I am currently a student in a University, one of which (because I am not a citizen or PR) costs my parents AUD70, 000(around USD50000) a year to send me to, and I have been here for four years of my six years study so I have wasted at least AUD210000. The reason I have wasted it is because I am probably the most arrogant, lazy and self-absorbed jackass mankind has ever known. And this very same sum of money can be used on my brother whose results could get him into almost every university in the world, but instead he has chosen a much cheaper university just to lighten the financial burden on my family. I screwed up Uni cause I THINK that I am fairly intelligent and henceforth procrastinate till the very last minute, I don't attend classes, lectures throughout my semesters, WON'T even bother to procrastinate therefore DON'T attend exams. And what do I do with my free time? I play computer games when everyone else is having classes and I have fun where theres someone else to have fun with and yet I travel again on my parents' money. My dad is old, failing in regards of his health and wishes to retire. I have no excuses whatsoever on being the screw up that I am, I born into a fairly well off and wholesome family, I have a girlfriend of three years who is kinda hot, treats me well, loves me and graduating in a month. My friends in both Australia and back home cares for me and are fantastic company. I was and am one of the lucky few whom don't have many problems to worry about. If all that hasnt made you hate me already, this probably will: I do believe I am a pathological liar, my parents and friends think Im doing fine in academically.     Now if youre not utterly disgusted already. My two reasons for not have ended my own life already is because for one I do believe in God and believe that Ill be damned eternally should I do so and the fact that its an absolute selfish act hurting my family, friends and girlfriend.    That is probably all I have to say regarding my predicament for now. I myself knowing that utter failure that I am, think I do deserve to die. I just need other opinions on what I should do.    PS: Christians should know that I do deserve to die because I have heard his word, came to have a relationship with him. Yet I pushed it away and to indulge in a life of sin. Despite me belief in him, I haven't obeyed his commandments.    just to let you know if this may comfort you at all... your already a much better man than I. you should have no reason to hate yourself. Besides your still young and have the rest of your life to turn it around.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Best thing you can do is sign yourself into a psychiatric hospital. go to the nearest E.R. if you dont know where one is, and tell them you want to kill yourself. They will take you to psych triage for nearly 12 hours and after they get the info they need they'll put you in a psychiatric hospital. Its a lot of help, and its nothing like the movies. you dont drool in a straight jacket or anything, just a vacation from worries and a place to get help.    GOod luck
73U1wJmnaa	Work related depression is one of the most common depressions out there. You probably feel down because your job is repetitive every day. And you don't really see the point in having to do it all the time. I recommend you look for another job. Not only having work depression is unhealthy for you mentally. It can also make you sick, and increase your risk of a heart attack significantly. Remember this quote,  "If you enjoy your job, you'll never work a day in your life."|`|3h0YURvSaa	Yes, if you can't change your job find an outlet. or a new routine to help you feel better until you find something else.  Is this something that can help you grow?  People can stress themselves into a heart attack over these dead end jobs.

It sounds to me as if your OB dropped the ball, big time. To have felt a lump the size of a golf ball and not follow through, seems negligent at best. Possibly worse. Never see that man again.

AA12358000	Zillzworth,  Ingrown hairs (pseudofolliculitis barbae or razor bumps), those red painful bumps that appear after shaving, are the result of shaved hairs getting trapped and growing back into the follicle. If you are not using the correct shaving method, this link will assist you -     http://menshair.about.com/od/shavingadvi...      Cleanse the skin with a product that contains salicylic acid and follow your shave with a lotion that contains this ingredient. Salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid derived from willow tree bark) causes the skin cells to slough off more easily, preventing pores from clogging. Use a gentle face scrub every other day to help remove dead skin and deep clean the pores. The use of a shaving brush will further clean the skin and lift the hairs to prepare for shaving. Give your skin a break from time to time. Shaving over the ingrown hairs will aggravate the problem, so skip shaving for a day or two if you can. Avoid electric razors, especially those with rotating heads. If you have the type of career that will allow it, opt for a collarless shirt or a shirt with a very low collar.

Or just buy a elecrtic trimmer and trim it|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Well use products for sensitive skin which you are already aware of but you may be using a crappy cheap razor. Get the good kind of razors that are triple bladed and a little more expensive. I know this helps because the cheap razors always give me bumps and ingrown hair. I use the triple blade daisy razors but since your a guy i would try mach 3 or 5 and a mild soap. Also if you have an ingrown hair pluck it with tweezers and only shave like 2 times per week or less if you can cause that will help not to irritate it too much. Also check out this site for help. www.webmd.com|`|sxUrktqraa	i don't know what you've tried, but have you tried bioskinrelief?   it has a lot of good reviews; i've never tried but it looks like it might help. sorry if it doesn't.. :(    http://www.bioskinrelief.com/|`|5ypdHLtGaa	i wonder if going to a barber to get your shave on would help... or... you could grow a beard?? you can try a zit cream with a sacyclic acid right after you shave, it will help reduce the redness & puss from the ingrown hair..|`|kC8JHWVQaa	Both men and women shave different areas of their bods. This is a huge problem for men and women. The problem on the face for men is difficult to treat but with some time and your work you can make it a tad better and some do get looking great.The ingrown hair on a face  is cut then grows inward back into the skin causing inflammation at point of penetration, this then becomes a razor bump an abnormality of the skin that makes the site of an ingrown hair. This may be from beard hair its self or from style of the shave you do Stiff and curly beard hairs are more likely to become ingrown. In addition shaving to close to the skin with a razor may irritate the skin even more.  Genetics could also be a cause for such ingrown hairs pores that trap  dirt/oils sensitive hair follicles are more likely to have ingrown hairs. Your beard looks lumpy?It's lumpy, tender, painful, itchy,and sore??Has the Potential to become infected? EXFOLIATE the skin to lift dead skin cells, loosens the tips of ingrown hairs and cleans out hair follicles.1st wet a sponge/loofah with Warm Water then squeeze the excess water out and gently massage the skin in a circular motion with it, you may want to treat razor bumps with active ingredients, Salicylic Acid is great for skin care Avoid alcohol products this dries the skin out and closes the pores and causes trapped hairs. (TRY )  cautiousty to lift the ends out with a pair of tweezers with out pulling the hair out. Then reduce redness on skin surface with products that contain witch hazel, azulene and allantoin Trying this could be helpful!  If you decide to keep using a regular razor be sure to use a new one each time you do shave this can get expenise ,Or loose the blade and get a Electric razor.. Ingrowen hairs can mimic other skin conditions so if this is always happening you may wish to seek out a dermatologist to be sure this is from shaveing and not something else. This can be a regular occurance  have you considered hair removel Go to a Dermatologist.  1) Try shaving in your shower either morning or evening this gets face hair softer and opens the face pores as well.  2) Shave with the Grain always.  3)Use Unsented shave creams/foams a good soap unsented (ivory)  Step 1: Exfoliate (30-60 sec)  Step2: Prepare (30secs) a pre shave oil is essential if have more than a day's growth a few drops will give a nice shave ( smooth)  Step3: (2 minutes) Brush !

sgQDnCfvaa	right now and when you get your braces tightened stick to liquids, its easier on your teeth. There acutally isn't too much you cant eat. with things like apples and carrots, slice them up and they are fine. apple juice and grape jam are fin, just avoid sticky things like taffy starbursts and gum. even with gum which they tell you not to eat, I had it all the time when I had braces, but sugar free gum was actually recommended by my orthodontist. Don't let your braces limit you. The only things I had troubles with and avoided were corn on the cob, chewy candies and I had to be careful with popcorn. Well, I hope this helps and good luck!|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	when I had braces I ate alot of grilled cheeses & soups. especially when they got tightened.  hang in there you'll love your teeth when they come off.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	mash potatoes
CLntHVQtaa	Hello, I'm not a Doctor so don't pretend to be able to diagnose, but some of these symptoms would fit with BDD. It does sound like you have extremely low self esteem, which is affecting you in many ways - anxiety, depression, negative beliefs / thinking, avoidant behaviour, unhelpful coping techniques...  It's always your choice, but all the things you describe are things that someone could help you with - a counsellor, a CBT therapist, psychologist, mental health worker whatever. You could access these services either through your GP, through a private Practitioner (expensive), your college counsellor, through the voluntary / non statutory sector eg your local womens centre.  Also, look for support / guidance in the internet. There is a really good self help book by Melanie Fennell ( I think ) called "Overcoming low self esteem" - might be worth a look.

FT2dOlZEaa	Be proud. You are larger than the average already.    Here's the basics:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|jnG8sOzWaa	4 ft.|`|E64juLwJaa	That is more then average for your age:a good start!!!!!

No worries!!!|`|EcCbforQaa	Long enough so that it sticks out of your pants when you pee.|`|iBMvPeT0aa	that sounds good!  dont worry through through puberty your penis will continue to grow so its not done yet!|`|Npi4QR7Maa	4" around??????????!!!!  WTF?????|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	you are 13 who cares|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Yea, that's a good size.|`|i9SZlhI2aa	wow your stupid|`|OVtUnuYnaa	I'm the exact way, long though i'm 1/2 longer.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	look in your pants for that answer|`|nZdq2GmTaa	hey, im 13 (14 in may) and im aroudn there. im probably a little more than 5" but not by much. 5.5" is the average for an adult so we will be fine. we got until like 19 to grow, so me and u both will have a few more inches coming out way|`|UfkOQsE2aa	Mine was 3" long and about 3" around at that age.|`|a5rInHwjaa	u r above average, dnt worry  if u hav any more questions, e-mail me im 14|`|nx8lxAJdaa	There is good news and in the middle news. The in the middle news is that they don't have an average size for 14 year olds. The good news is, that is because your penis is still growing! You are in your early puberty years, and your penis won't stop growing until you reach your peak at around 18 years old. So don't count what your size is now, just wait until about three or four years down the road!|`|YhIq961xaa	You're fine, and still a growing boy. If you're wondering how long you should be erection size, well that depends too. But normally I'd say between 5-8 inches is normal.|`|rw1KOT3Uaa	In my oppinion when you truly love a person, you shouldn't give an F about their penis size. So if you worried about getting involved in romance someday, if it is the right person, they aren't gonna object to your size. If your worried about the other dudes will say if they see it, well, a lot of guys are a holes man, you'll just have to get through that if they say any crap. When it comes to your penis, worry about if it does the things it supposed to... does it piss and *** and get hard when it needs to... is it clean and healthy... that's more important than the length.    word of wisdom... not every guy who tells you they are 13 on here is probably really 13... there might be some old men on here that want to get pictures of your penis. be careful.    You're probably straight so I don't think you want to hear this from a gay person but... anyway that's what i think.
9OsjdsrZaa	They don't really hurt, at first...but then they hurt for about a week or so.  The pain will start receding  and then it becomes just kind of a nuisance.  Like when you get a piece of food stuck between your teeth.  You constantly worry it with your tongue.  Eventually though, you forget they are there and the feeling goes away.  But, it is better than getting another tooth pulled.      Good luck.|`|gat4KThKaa	Wisdom Teeth Pulled.|`|423dac9ccdf068c5650bc0ec9c26ec65aa	For me they hurt after about a week and whenever I chewed on a hard piece of food it would hurt. I would take Tylenol and Aspirin and that helped but it went away after about 2 weeks. As far as hurting as much as getting a tooth pulled...No. A tooth getting pulled is much worse. I would rather have spacers any day.
9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	There really isn't anything you can do yourself to stop this.  Your problem is with how the contact lenses fit.  It sounds like the lenses are "too loose".  Without examining you it would be impossible for me to be sure what would be your best solution.      Look on your box of contact lenses and look for a number.  You will either see an 8.4 or an 8.7.  If your lenses are 8.7 then it would be possible to refit you with an 8.4 (which is tighter) and it is possible the lenses wouldn't slip.  If this isn't the case then your only real option is to tell your eye doctor that even though it seems to be ok with him, it isn't ok with you.  Ask him to either refit you in another brand or allow you to discontinue contact lens wear and have the cost of your contacts (not your exam fees) refunded to you.
H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Like hearing and vision, taste and smell tend to deteriorate with age. In addition, various illnesses and injuries can damage the nerves connecting the sense organs to the brain. Loss of smell, for example, can be caused by nasal or sinus infections, nasal polyps, meningitis, or brain tumors. Loss of smell can affect taste.  So can allergies, tongue injuries, stroke, or tumors. You should consult your physician to rule out possible underlying disorders. And good luck.|`|JMZkaf1jaa	I agree you should go see a doctor.|`|qJrTInyBaa	It has to do with a stuffy nose and will come back within several days do not panic
553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	I have the exact same problem!!! I'm a guy if it makes you feel any better...haha! I was using Degree Clinical Strength and my sweat was still just dripping through all over my shirts! I finally got the guts to go to the doctor. He prescribed Drysol for me. You actually just dab it on the sweaty parts of your body (hands, armpits, or feet) 1 to 2 times a week right before you go to bed. Right when you start with drysol, you need to apply it a couple nights in a row to get it in your system. After that, just 1 to 2 times a week. It works almost flawless on my armpits but its just basically a waste of medication on my hands and feet. I really hope this helps and I feel for you... I know how annoying it is to be sweating in the middle of winter when your body is actually cold. Good luck!!|`|59iSPST0aa	Call your doctor, and they can give you a prescription deodorant.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	you have a disease, which causes you too sweat a whole lot, many girls and guys have it. you just need to go to a doctor, and they'll prescribe you with some pills to help it out.|`|5rtLTmd0aa	maybe you're just very manly.
E64juLwJaa	I do have a suggestion for the both of you:see a urologist seen you cannot conceive.  This could be the problem.  Maybe your pipes are made wrong:but they can almost fix anything.  Seems you pee a bit of semen each time.  Planets.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	bits of semen in urine|`|F3Fx1YLRaa	it is sperm you should go and get it checked out|`|UdeUrTCSaa	most likely sperm, if you just jacked off and peed then yes it sperm  if its been 12 hours since you last masturbated and pee milky stuff, well then i dont know|`|QePbhS8Caa	You shouldn't be pushing to drain your bladder. You're supposed to relax the muscles as much as possible and let it flow out. Pushing is not good. It's possible you've damaged something internal.     In any case, you should definitely go see your dr about this, possibly a urologist.|`|0645d76605e816db4c51ed9c49697db7aa	I think that it is probably fluid from your prostate -- yes, there may be sperm mixed in with this fluid; however, it is fairly unlikely that it is all semen.  When we urinate, the pc muscle controls the flow of the urine by shutting off the flow of everything else (ie -- semen/prostate fluid), so that we can empty the bladder effectively.  More than likely, your pc muscle is weak and is therefore allowing prostate fluid to seep through.  Have your doctor check it out.
nLrbleCPaa	Transplant.|`|yazZH4khaa	Get some antibiotic solution that you can use that will not affect you if some gets in your mouth. Get some Carmex also.|`|8pR35Rapaa	lip chap!
tXNjHlCWaa	The first part of your question sounds as if you just got a sore throat due to cold air, it happens to me all the time. However the statement that you are getting hot and cold sounds more like you might be getting a fever.      You might be getting the flu or something like it and if the symptoms continue for a day or so I would say it's pretty likely.    If you just have a sore throat I have found that it helps to keep it warm. Wear a nice warm scarf wrapped around your neck as much as possible if the house is cold. If you don't have scarf, a towel or even an old t-shirt would work.  Also, you can gargle with warm salt water. I don't know the exact amount of salt to put in a cup of water, but I use about a teaspoon. Don't swallow it!  It will likely make you throw up, just gargle and spit it out.    Hope that helps and that you feel better soon. But remember, if the symptoms continue several days or get really bad, go see a doctor or go to a clinic.|`|e0EG293naa	If you had strep throat, you would see white spots on the back of your throat.  If you do, see a doctor and get medication because strep is contagious.    Gargling w/warm water & salt is the best remedy for a sore throat.  The mixture helps to combat and clear the infection.  Do it as often as you can til you feel better.      You could be going through the flu, it still is flu season.  Hope I helped and you feel better soon :)|`|AA10563860	Getting hot and cold is typical of fever.  You have a common cold.  Try numbing throat lozenges or gargling with salt water to alleviate the pain.  Get rest, and in a week you will be over it.    PS  I'm a big fan of zinc, echinacea, vitamin C while you are sick.  With a throat that sore...consider zinc lozenges (cold-eze brand doesn't taste bad)|`|qc7zP89jaa	Sore throat..  I have that too  Just gurgle salty water  and eat cough drops  :) It should make u fell better  -Tina|`|mGUxdFELaa	you have a sore throat. and chills. the common cold.|`|4mdUJ9LHaa	I have been in this situation many times. You probably have Strep Throat. Go see a doctor immediately. If you are not treated for Strep, it could lead to other diseases. Otherwise it is very minor. All you will have to do is take  "Penicillin" (which your doctor will give you a prescription for), for a few days. I wish you well!
JMZkaf1jaa	Sleeping problems can lead to poor health over time.  This happened to me.  I got really sick for several months with intestinal problems.  My doctor told me that if you don't get proper rest, over time it could make you more vunerable and less resistance to flu, colds, all kinds of things.  Go see your doctor and tell doctor all you have stated here.|`|nLrbleCPaa	I would lay off the caffeine after 5:00 in the evening and see if that helps.|`|yazZH4khaa	Since the problem has been going on for months, it would be wise to go to your doctor at this point.   Hope you start sleeping better. Do not start using the over the counter sleep aids before consulting with your doctor. Often times those remedies can get addicting and make things worse.|`|UvU2eVcKaa	Hi there, Im wondering .. are you on any kind of regular medication? Sometimes that can affect your sleep pattern. Also , do you make up for lost sleep by having a nap in the day time? We end up developing bad habits and our brain gets used to waking at a certain time. In order to change these habits, you need to stay awake during the day. It wont change things instantly but over a period of a week or so, you will hopefully get back into a better pattern. Hope this is of some help to you. x
nLrbleCPaa	No it is not contagious and can not be spread by touch. It is a skin disorder.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	eczema is inherited, it's genetic, it is NOT contagious.|`|cjKPEHaFaa	No.  My husband has it really bad, and if anyone were to have caught it from him, it would have been me.|`|AA11538461	No, it is an allergy.|`|WadzK6ejaa	No.it is autoimmune disease like allergy to something|`|59iSPST0aa	No and No
K1iUzewyaa	You heard a pop... I did that one time. Was playing basketball, planted towards the ball, and my left calve muscle popped. It hurt so bad. I could barely drive my standard back home. Was stiff for like two Weeks. I went to a sports specialist, he had me do  few things, ie, standing on my tip toes. Stretching. It ended up being a torn calve muscle. He said stay inactive for at least  6-7 Weeks to give it time to heal. he recommended me to ice it down whenever I get a chance. nothing you can really do. Check your Achilles tendon, make sure that it did not tear. If it is extremely sore, you may have damaged that tendon. Other than that, take some advil. Be sure to stretch it as often as possible. This hurts pretty bad, but you have to stretch it to keep it limber. Also, massage it from time to time to loosen it up. You'll be hobbling around for 1-2 weeks, but eventually it will start feeling better. If you feel as though this didn't help, go see a specialist, but the info I told you cost me $80 just to see the  doc..|`|6PNuFgTJaa	Try a heating pad. If not, go to the doctor.|`|BnR4LLhxaa	One other possibility is a torn Achilles tendon. That will need surgical repair.   You really need to get to a doctor about this to figure out what it is. Torn Achilles can be hard to fix if left untreated too long.|`|hzFf2SLAaa	RICE - Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Prop your leg up, and alternate between hot and cold packs. (For heat, take uncooked rice, and put it in a clean sock. Microwave.) If it doesn't get better in 1-2 days, see your doctor (preferably an orthopedic if you can). If you develop numbness or tingling in the area below the pain, call your ER.|`|NMJYzPZLaa	you most likely tore a muscle ive done it a few times try putting icy hot on it or something like that and if that doesnt work then go to the doctors to get an M.R.I
rpnFxnCQaa	Diana,    You should start using a "preventive cream" as soon as possible. The cream I used - Stretch Mark Prevention - had both a preventative and a corrective function. There is no set rule on when you should start using the cream but it will prevent the formation of scar tissue in the remaining weeks.
