FFqWeIX7aa	"Penunggu" are Nothing... they didn't have power to disturb people.<br>  <br>  They didn't harm people. But, TOO AFRAID/THINK about them will make them feel superior. <br>  Actually, in many cases, human harm themselves, not penunggu.<br>  <br>  p/s: <br>  believing that Penunggu have power to disturb them is Khurafat. <br>  It is against scientific reason, and against Islam. <br>  Muslim can be an infidel because of that. <br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT NOTE:<br>  <br>  For Edward and All another Christian here<br>   PLEASE DON'T READ BELOW POST TO AYESHA. <br>  Practice your faith, and I’ll not disturb it…<br>  I ONLY REPLY FOR AYESHA HERE.<br>  And if you read it; (I can’t control you) I beg my first apology from you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And for above Ayesha: <br>  "Well, most of those whom I know that have been attacked by evil spirits were malays." <br>  - Well, because they are majority, obviously, the most people that got HIV, physcologic problems and all other disease are them...<br>  <br>  In China, most of Chinese has been attack by "evil Spirits". In India, most Indian has been attacked by "evil spirits".<br>  <br>  <br>  And If you are Christian, better practice your own religion rather than promoting it to Muslim. Because:<br>  <br>  1. Muslim didn't reject JESUS - we accept him as MESSIAH (Al-Masih) and APOSTLE. <br>  <br>  But, we reject Christian making 3-Head-Being as God when there is no such evidence in Bible. <br>  Tell me, where "trinity" exist in Bible???<br>  Where Holy Spirit is referred as God??<br>  <br>  Messiah means THE APPOINTED ONE, and GOD is NOT APPOINTED! <br>  Reject Godliness of Jesus didn't told as features of Dajjal in Bible. It is just reject him as Messiah. <br>  You should tell that to atheist and Jews.<br>  According to these verses, they are anti-Christ, not Muslim that called Jesus as “Isa Al-Masih (Isa the Messiah)”<br>  <br>  <br>  2. It is better to be in Islam rather than give up our rationality to embrace Christianity. <br>  First, we might have to hear children fables that can be concluded in a simple way:<br>  <br>  "One God send himself to impregnate his own mother, to be born just to be crucified at the end, due to clear up something that he created by himself called sins." - It sounds stupid isn't it?<br>  <br>  3. We didn't have to choose any of tenth sects of Christianity in Islam. If we enter Christianity, then we need to blow up our own brain for that.<br>  <br>  4. Arab people are Sons of Abraham. They know ALLAH like Jews did, but like Jews, they sway into idolatry. <br>  <br>  Muhammad, Elijah and Elisha were prophets that abolish idolatry. <br>  That doesn't mean Yhwh of Jews is a Fertile God, so do Allah for the Arabs. (thanks for the site)<br>  <br>  5. And please don't teach me about doctrins created by churches. <br>  I'm student of Comparative Religion. <br>  I read bible since 12. <br>  I know what in WHAT condition and HOW Luke 16:16 has been uttered.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  p/s: <br>  Protestant Calvinist say POPE is ANTI-CHRIST, Some CHRISTIAN also say that PAUL is Anti-Christ and false prophet...<br>  “POPE and PAUL lead to billions of eternal damnation...”<br>  (It is not what Muslims say - it is your own Christian brother!)<br>  <br>  How about that?<br>  <br>  I beg my second apology. Please forgive me, if it hurt you so much. <br>  You practice your religion, and lets Muslim practice Islam.<br>  <br>  <br>  =(|`|EMeAw7Bcaa	sometimes disturb people, they are ghost if you see a ghost do you think it disturb you?<br>  <br>  sometime if gave 4D striking number|`|YG7nHfLCaa	no.<br>  unless u disturb them, i.e. try to destroy the house they're living, hurt the family members, etc.<br>  cause penunggu's are some sort of housekeeper.<br>  they make sure everything/everyone in the house's safe and sound....

Imqb5ueqaa	It has to be real because I have spent P132,000 in the last 3 week hoping to win the jackpot.<br>  <br>  While I always knew Lotto to be real, I never made any bet before, knowing that the odds are just unbelievable. When I heard 2 radio personalities talking about the P132M jackpot (then), I started to bet. And as a first-time bettor, I spent P27,720 for three boxes of Sytem 12. I eagerly waited for that Sunday's draw, and got only 2 digits.<br>  <br>  The next Sunday, I made the same bet. Still, no one won.<br>  <br>  I didn't know there were also draws on Tuesdays and Thursdays,I thought all along it was just on Sundays. So I made a bet last Tuesday, and then last Thursday where the pot reached P288. <br>  <br>  Because no one has won it, I made another bet for today (Sunday). This time, I made 3 boxes of System 12.<br>  <br>  I wish someone would win the draw tonight. Then I will stop betting and maybe just next when I get excited again.<br>  <br>  Other than my belief that it is real, it is real because it is so logical how they can give away those prizes from the bets. It is still extremely profitable for the PCSO.<br>  <br>  And the lotto system is the same as those in other countries like the USA and Australia.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Well, IT IS REAL......<br>  I heard of a married guy who could not find a job with income so as to suffice the needs of his spoiled wife.  As a result, the wife left him to be with a richer guy.  After sometime, he poor guy was able to win a lottery and for sure, the wife would return to him.  Another instance, I heard of a lady from Manila who happened to win this lottery also.  She gave "balato" to her neighbors. <br>  About the Sweepstakes, well, it's real also. For my "Nanay-Nanayan" told me that she happened to become a lawyer when her Uncle won.  They were 18 out of school youth when their Uncle won and all of them were able to go back to school.<br>  But I hope to win, at least, a million or two so as to fulfill my dreams.... they are........ to go on Hospital Hopping and School Feeding Program.<br>  GOD BLESS ALL OF US, AMEN.|`|ZswqMnQlaa	yeah i think its quite believable although the most i won is four numbers out of 6 (500 pesos only). now each ball is weighed and witnessed by selected group, all from different walks of life and the live draw supervised by dti, and all these is recorded on video. i dont see how can they rig this. but i wouldn't be surprised if it is proven otherwise.|`|1J9f4HWraa	i think its real because it is visible to the public in national television while drawing the wining numbers and there were no hoax focus of it.|`|oqiw8Ruuaa	a friend told me<br>  that a lotto winner<br>  was once interviewed on TV.<br>  he was asked what he's gonna do<br>  with the money he won and stuff.<br>  <br>  also, there was a winner<br>  who got so stressed because<br>  he doesn't know how to spend his<br>  hundred million price money,<br>  and died because of thinking about it.<br>  sounds kinda stupid ey?<br>  <br>  what's more is,<br>  a former instant millionaire<br>  who lost his fortune in months<br>  because of spending too much<br>  was seen on TV (Korina Sanchez)<br>  "na nananawagan"<br>  to those who owe him<br>  to pay him back immediately.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  on the other hand,<br>  i also heard from a reliable source<br>  that they use to "invent" winners.<br>  <br>  a long time ago,<br>  there's this broadcaster<br>  who tried to get the latest scoop<br>  by looking for lotto winners<br>  to conduct a personal interview.<br>  <br>  but to his surprise,<br>  the names and addresses<br>  of the winners given to him<br>  does not exist.<br>  <br>  so to speak,<br>  they tricked the filipinos<br>  by proclaiming that there are winners,<br>  when in fact, there's none.<br>  <br>  so where did the jackpot money go?<br>  well, that i don't know.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  i personally want to try<br>  betting on lotto even just once<br>  because it looks kinda fun.<br>  <br>  who knows?<br>  i might become an instant<br>  hundred millionare myself!<br>  <br>  but if doing so will just help<br>  the ploiticians become richer,<br>  ohh forget it.<br>  <br>  well, it's not bad to believe in luck.<br>  but if you're gonna depend on it forever,<br>  you're not gonna succeed.|`|tUPXslOMaa	Haha!  Filipinos are so gullible.  It's election time and they need a lot of money to raise funds and one of them is raising money through PSCO.  I know a friend of my mother who works in PAGCOR that said when the jackpot reaches 100M mark it's not given away to the deserving winners.  It's automatically bagged by corrupt govt officials.  Believe me.  Aren't you scratching your head by this time?  PCSO has been giving away enormous amounts of money for the longest time around and yet the Philippines is still one of the poorest countries in the world.  Where are they hiding their winnings?<br>  <br>  added:<br>  FG?  Karma?

0bd69a0d27e95121bac8f9b19a25d7b7aa	Although the currency is the same - the doolar, after all it's in the US, the wages are generally higher to compensate for the higher prices of goods and services.<br>  The cost of living difference between your current location and Juneau (or another Alaskan city) could be quite high or it could be about the same. Evening movies in Juneau are $10.00 ($9-$9.75 in Anchorage), a loaf of good bread like Oro Wheat is about $3.50, gas in Juneau is $2.65 a gallon and is about the same in Anchorage.<br>  <br>  Housing in Juneau is still expensive, even with the turn down in the housing market. I bought a 1300 square foot house in downtown Douglas for $163,000 in 2000 which was recently assessed at $256,600. Rent for a two bedroom apt. can be around 900 bucks and up. Electricity/oil heating another 100 bucks a month (or more) but that has gone up quite a bit lately too. My annual oil bill last year was around $1,700 but if the price of oil stays low, it should only be about $900 this year.<br>  <br>  In April of 2008 an avalanche took out Juneau's hydro power so the electricity rates temporarily went up by more than 500%!!!, but barring natural disasters and provided there's enough water in the lake, Juneau's electricity is relatively cheap and clean. Villages in the Bush are another story, with rates that continue to be hundreds of times higher than the national average.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, salaries tend to be higher in Alaska as well. Make sure that you determine the cost of living adjustment for Alaska by using a cost of living calculator. You can put in the calculator that you make 50 grand where you live now, and it might tell you that you'll need to make 70 grand in Juneau (for example) but figure that out so you can negotiate a fair salary.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	Goods are more expensive, but housing is cheaper.<br>  <br>  Alaska doesn't have a different currency.

Street food is okay, but if you're a bit worried, try eating at a local Thai place.  You'll be amazed at how "alive" the food tastes.  Thai food outside of Thailand has little flavor and is considerably milder in hotness.  Add to the fact that a plate of Pad Thai noodles will cost you less than a Thai Iced Tea does back home at a Thai restaurant.<br>  <br>  -explore one of the many Thai buddhist temples (Wats).  There's a real sense of religion once you walk into one of these.  It's an almost humbling experience.  The Grand Palace is a good place to start- but be sure to visit the nearby Wat Po to see a huge golden reclining Buddha.  Awesome experience.<br>  <br>  -I'm not sure exactly how you should do this- but try to connect with the Thai people.  You'll be amazed at how open and friendly they genuinely are.  I have a numerous Thai friends, and on several occasions, they've invited me into their homes and introduced me to their families.  Their warmth and kindness is something that will most likely move you.  <br>  <br>  Yes, there are a ton of touristy places to see in Thailand- but I think you should really try to go out of your way to see the REAL Thailand.  That's something I've tried to do on each of my several visits.|`|AA10254694	The sun setting on the Mekong.|`|FCFdYuchaa	<a href="http://spa-thai-guide.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spa-thai-guide.blogspot.com/</a>|`|NXBmcEz7aa	And don't forget the  jungles tours, the elephant at works and elephant rides, and also see them paint beautiful pictures that  will defy your imaginations.

You have everything here :     http://www.ratp.info/orienter/horaires_m...    The hours of the first and last "mtro" vary per line. You'd better know if you want to catch the last mtro at the beginning of the line (around 00:45) or in the middle (moire like 1:05)... And beware of correspondances.    One important thing (and it's only been a couple of years, so not everybody knows about this) is that the last mtro is one hour later on Friday and Saturday nights.    From 00:30 to 5:30, you have a quite efficient night bus system, called "noctilien", that covers the more usual bus routes in Paris (radiating from Chatelet in the center).    http://www.noctilien.fr/Noctilien/Recher...    And you can also do what we do when there is no subway, no bus, no taxi : take a Velib' bike... or walk ! Paris is not that big.    http://www.en.velib.paris.fr/comment_ca_...

You have to be dependable, good with customer service, ability to think quickly (in case of an emergency), be flexible, etc.    Yes, at times it can be fun.  However, you often have short layovers where you are lucky to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up, shower and start flying again.      The training depends on the airline you are training with.  When I went through training, it was 7 weeks long.    The problem is, airlines won't be hiring for quite some time.  With the economy as bad as it, the airlines are reducing their flight schedules, and furloughing their employees.  Before they can hire again, they have to give all the furloughed employees a chance to come back to work.  It will probably be a few years before a lot of the airlines are hiring again.
49afe7fb4216adf3acff6d2f20b3c7ddaa	Well I don't know the meaning but the new generation Koreans think that any girls name  with "soon" is funny because it used to be very common back in the days, probably in their grandmother's generation. (40's, 50's,). It sounds very old fashion and not pretty. "Kim Sam Soon" does not like her name because kids used to tease her because "soon" is an old name. For example, Koreans used to have many kids in the past and the parents would name the 1st kid Soon Hee, 2nd kid Soon Duk . 3rd- Soon Ja, and so on (that was the trend). People can usually tell that the person is around your mother's age by their name.|`|rILO9Gazaa	"Sam Soon" is not a funny name; it is just an ugly, old-fashioned name and that's why she hates her name so much in the show.<br>  <br>  Like the other answerer mentioned, any name with "Soon" was common back in the 1930s or 1940s. Plus, "Sam" means "three" or "third" and she got her name "Sam Soon" because she is a 3rd daughter of her family. Her grandpa was so upset about having three girls in a row and named her in a tacky way.<br>  <br>  If you are an English speaker, think of names like "Gertrude", "Mildred" or "Eleanor". Apparently, they are not so pretty names for young ladies.|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	lol<br>  It's a very old-fashioned name.<br>  <br>  It's like, "Bertha" in English.|`|jr8nnpcaaa	its not funny its just<br>  a really irregular name so yeah.<br>  and the name is kind of ugly.|`|nFslQoFDaa	Sam Soon is basically an embarrassing name.|`|m0clHQGyaa	The tv drama Kim Sam Soon right?

Seriously, if you've ever spent more than 1 hour in any airport you'll know what I mean.  Even the airports which are meant to be good are boring as hell after an hour or so.  On recent travels I had 10 hour lay-overs at Heathrow, Hong Kong and Melbourne and they all completely sucked.  Hong Kong was the best of the bunch, but only cause they had long seats that you could sleep on.  And security is just a pain in the a** at any airport in the world.<br>  <br>  The less time in any airport the better.|`|344865ded03787b2a2a2ae3e46861399aa	I hate the Frankfurt/Main airport in Germany.

I have taught in Korea of and on for over 6 years, so I have stopped here many times on the way to and from Seoul.  It is so boring and there aren't many shops or restaurants.  Once, on the way back to the states, I got stuck at Tokyo/Narita for 8 hours after my flight to the states was delayed.  Tokyo is also bad for delays for some reason.  Once, on the way to Korea, my flight almost got canceled until the next day, so they were going to bus everyone out to a hotel in Tokyo and wake everyone up as early as possible the next day to go to Korea.  Thankfully, they endeed up deciding to let the plane go on to Korea that night as scheduled.  <br>  <br>  My favs are Changi International in Singapore and HK International in Hong Kong. These airports rock!  Incheon in Korea was the number 3 airport in the world in 2008.  Hong Kong was number 1 for the seventh year in a row, and Singapore was number 2.  I personally don't think Incheon is good enough for the number 3 slot.  It's also quite boring, but nowhere near as bad as Tokyo/Narita.  It's funny, because one would think Tokyo would have a great airport, with Tokyo being the world's largest city.  But don't let that fool you.|`|CV2zXQ1Eaa	i really disliked chicago o'hare. the inter-terminal tram system thing really fails. hard. <br>  and tokyo-narita REALLY stinks if you have a layover; they have a separate crummy little terminal for connecting flights. <br>  <br>  and i find newark airport quite irritating. <br>  <br>  toronto pearson used to be the crummiest of them all, but now the new renovations made it quite nice (although there isn't enough eating places.. they're often overly crowded, esp in terminal 3)<br>  <br>  my favourite airports?<br>  hong kong<br>  amsterdam schiphol<br>  detroit-wayne county metro (only the mcnamara terminal tho)|`|p7Toql00aa	Negative: I would have to say the CDG Paris Air Port...ok some parts are nice, but others look really third-world-retro-seventies.

AA11496012	There are scheduled maintenance checks the aircraft has to go through once it has reached a certain number of flights or hours of service.  Also the first officer or captain will walk around the airplane before departure.  Just know that not every aircraft is perfect when it leaves the gate but it is still safe.  Before the captain flies, he/she is given a list of what is wrong with the airplane.  It is up to him/her to determine if that is a problem or not.|`|d19d6d11466a952bf245413b8442de9eaa	Yes all planes in US are checked before every flight domestic or international.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	They are called "pre flight inspections".

3fHZOobiaa	It depends on what you would like to visit...<br>  <br>  If you are interested in art and culture, I suggest you Rome, Venice and Florence, if you are looking for beautiful natural landscapes, I recommend you:<br>  <br>  Alps for the mountains, especially "Dolomiti" (Trento, Bolzano, Belluno)<br>  <br>  Tuscan for the countryside<br>  <br>  Sicily, Sardinia, Campania and Liguria for the sea<br>  <br>  See these sites for he weather:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.italy-weather-and-maps.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.italy-weather-and-maps.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weather.com/common/drilldown/IT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.weather.com/common/drilldown/...</a>|`|AA11065099	I think you would benefit from reading up on it in a travel book.  As well, you would be advised to get a travel guide like 'Let's Go to Europe!' or Let's Go to Italy!', or maybe a Fodor's Guide to the region.  The Let's Go! books often tell you where you can go to get Italian food and how you can find affordable places at which to eat and sleep on a shoestring budget.  As well, you should log on to the web site for Eurail.  I believe that it is <a href="http://www.Eurail.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.Eurail.com.</a>  Travel by train on a rail pass can be affordable.  You also can rent a car.  However, when you rent a car you have the problem of parking and finding gasoline stations.<br>  <br>  Four places I think you should include on your trip are Rome, Florence, Pisa  and Venice.  If you have more time, you might be interested in places such as Sienna, Assisi in Tuscany, and Milan further north.<br>  <br>  If you try to see too much, you might be rushed and not have as good a time as you would have had had you been more relaxed.<br>  <br>  Most of the major sites of interest to tourists are located in the center of the old part of the town or city.  It is the reason train travel often is suited towards tourism in many places.  The central station often is situated in the center of town.<br>  <br>  As far as tourist sites are concerned, I would say that Rome is divided into three major areas:  the ruins, The Vatican (known as "Vaticano") and the downtown area which contains numerous piazzas or squares.  Inside the ruins, you can see the Forum, the Colosseum and the Capitoline building.  A statue of Romulus and Remus can b found near the Capitoline, ehich contains stairs.  The Vatican City contains the Basilica of St. Peter and the Vatican Museum, whre you can view the Sistine Chapel as well as many art objects and paintings.  The downtown area has many nice fountains such as the Fonatan Trevi, or Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, which are great for sitting on and chatting.<br>  <br>  Florence has many pieces of old architecture, including the Cathedra of Santa Maria del Fiore and the baptistry that is a part of it and contains bronze doors designed by Ghiberti.  The Campanile is clearly visible.  The Ponte Vecchio is a famous bridge found in the center of Florence.  The church of Santa Croce is where both Michelangelo and Machiavelli are buried.  The Pitti Palace is another site you can explore on foot.  The Uffizi art galery in Florence is wolrd-renowned for its old apintings, and the Academia di Belle Arti is where you can view the famous stature of David by Michelangelo.<br>  <br>  In Pisa, you might want to take a look at the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  A Cathedral and baptistry near it ar interesting architectural works.<br>  <br>  In Venice you can view the Rialto bridge, the Piazza San Marco, where you can see the Cathedral of St. Mark, the 14th-century bell tower and the 15th-centruy clock tower.  Nearby are the Palce of the Doges, officially known as the Palazzo Ducale.  The  Bridge of Sighs, where prisoners were taken on route to their improsonment or execution and therefore must haved let out sighs, extends fromone of these palaces.  The Grand Canal runs through the center of Venice.<br>  <br>  Milan is famous for its Gothic Cathedral and the Churuch of Santa Maria delle Grazie, which contains the painting by Leonardo da Vinci called 'The Last Supper'.  As well, it is famous for the La Scala opera house  and for its glass-covered shopping arcade called the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.<br>  <br>  Near Naples are the ruins of Pompeii, dominated by Mount Vesuvius.<br>  <br>  The north of Italy has many lakes which are renowned for their beauty, including Lake Maggiore, Lake Como and Lake Garda. <br>  <br>  Many other cities exist to explore, including Verona, Bologna and Ravenna.  Italy also has a Riviera, the Riviera dei Fiori, or Coast of Flowers, which begins at the French border and extends to Savona.<br>  <br>  Many places in Italy can be explored by foot from within the town or city in which they are located.|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	I would start from a good guide, as Lonely planet.<br>  Personally I think spring and autumn are the best seasons, summer is good for bathing, winter for skiing<br>  Italian cuisine is so varied that each place you will visit will have its special dishes, even for that a good guide could help, or a restaurant guide, like Michelin

sOUvTcWRaa	Well the answer to your question is both. The female tourists get drunk before the parade starts and then a float rider either persuades the girl to flash for some beads she wants or she just flashes for fun. Its usually only tourists though because people from here are used to getting beads and they probably have garbage bags full of beads at home, the other reason girls from here don't flash is because they know they'll get arrested.|`|4U7327Mzaa	Because they are drunk????|`|omp5Rpqqaa	both really, alcohol is a hell of an invention|`|AA11285960	they want attention, and flashing is the easiest way to get it.|`|tUSx6V0Paa	idk. maybe bcuz they feel sexy and beautiful when they show off like that. plus its a party.|`|vpmRRamKaa	they're not tourists<br>  just really cheap,slutty,drunk college girls|`|TskZHzZyaa	N'awlins has an anything goes reputation that the tourists get into.

I think they made the mistake of omitting the last "S" in the name, and thought they were the The  Schutzstaffel, (German for "Protective Squadron"), abbreviated SS, which was a major Nazi organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The SS grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as the Führer's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men, (both on the front lines and as political police) managed to exert as much political influence as the Wehrmacht. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during the World War II, and most of the worst of those crimes.<br>  <br>  Note the last statement from Wiki.  "...  responsible for many of the crimes against humanity....".    I think this applies to the other institution in your question, so I wish the Mossad good luck.

5zQbG8TDaa	Yes you get paid for it. Not sure how much but they do furnish meals.
eMCeiNQgaa	well that's tough.. you are a bit young to be going somewhere across the world alone with a boy. i guess it depends how long you've been together though.    just tell her how its a once in a lifetime opportunity, and that she knows if the chance came up for her when she was your age, she would want her mom to tell her yes.     Tell her you are turning 16 and will be responsible enough, and that you will talk to her everyday even if its 3 times a day if you can go.
78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	You will want to take most of the clothes you need, but buy just a few there.  Here's why:  First of all, you are large by Japanese standards.  A size 0-2 here would be a medium there, a size 4-6 a large, and a size 8-10 an extra large.  A size XXL (meaning a 12 - 14 American) will be nearly impossible to find.  If you stay the same weight you are right now, you will have a very hard time finding clothing, especially undergarments b/c caucasian women are also more "shapely".  (So take all the underwear you need with you, and plan on taking most of your outerwear.)  You will be able to find some things, though, and it IS nice to purchase some things once you are abroad because the styles are different.  You will want to dress so that you fit into the culture.  If you are able to lose weight so that you are down to a size 8 here, you may be able to find a few things, but there's still a problem.  Though there is variation, overall Japan has a much higher cost of living than the USA, so clothes there will be very expensive by our standards.  More stylish (in my opinion), but more expensive too!  You'll of course want to buy some things, but keep that in mind.  Try to leave 25% of your suitcase empty (or fill it with potential gifts) so that you can bring back some of those things.  More good news is that if you eat an Asian diet, you probably will lose quite a bit of weight.  When you pack your suitcase, you will need to fit a lot into the space and weight (get the information about luggage size and weight from your airline's web site).  Plan outfits very carefully to layer and mix and match.  Before you shop for clothing, look online or in magazines to get a feel for styles, I think styles here are generally about a year behind theirs!  If you have Japanese friends here, get them to help you shop.  Finally, there is no way you are going to find your size in shoes in Japan, for the most part!  Purchase your shoes here, but be very careful to plan your clothing and shoes so that it will all fit in your luggage!  If you do ship a box, plan ahead for the 4 - 8 weeks it will take and ship it by sea because the cost (while still expensive) is much less than shipping by air.|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	Shoes: seriously, bring as many as you can!!!  Clothes: there are quite a few international boutiques who carry M and L sizes (Zara, MNG, GAP, Topshop, H&M, and so on...though they can be far more expensive here).    Good luck :)    PS: about lingerie. If you are above 34B or C, bring good ones also. Here is very difficult to find bras without padding, or with good support...and they usually run small.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes, but in those sizes your choices will be very limited. Not only that, but clothes will cost more. My GF is 5' 6" and 105 pounds.She has problems finding clothes that fit because of her height. On average, Japanese women are shorter and thinner. So I'd suggest you buy some clothes here first, as well as shoes, just to be safe. You can always buy something there if you see something you like.|`|AA12004593	I think you will have problem in Japan finding larger size.|`|GjfWcWj6aa	I don't think you will have a problem.  There are bigger people in Japan too so it shouldn't be a problem.  Take a lot of your clothes just incase.|`|WtYz6VKMaa	whooa 12 inches.that is large.that is like 30 cm.i dont wanna offend you but most likely people over there will be surprised.and you have to wear manly sneekers.(nevetheless there are little variety of 30cm shoes!)|`|vS7iaCeAaa	Yes, you'll have problems. I'd bring my own shoes and clothes if I were you. Most Japanese women are thin.
CZYXO1NFaa	I lived and studied in both places and absolutely loved them both...but there are some big differences.    Petra is a relatively small place, there isn't much to do there other than see the site, but it is AMAZING, one of the coolest places. Amman is a very modern and nice city, but even the historical part of Amman is not all that thrilling. I love Jordan for the people and the lesser known historical sites, but it is not a power house like Egypt.    Cairo is chalked full of exciting and amazing places to see and visit. Even the museum is worth seeing, and most people don't like archeology museums. I don't think anyone would have to sell you on the idea of Egypt.    I guess it just depends on what you are looking for. If you want something a bit more out of the way and exotic then Petra would be a great choice. However, Egypt has enough to keep you completely busy and enjoying all the places for at least a week. Petra is a 1 or 2 day thing, where Cairo alone could take a week. So it just depends on what your trip will be like.    After having lived in both, if I had a chance to go back to just one I would go back to Egypt.    Have fun and enjoy wherever you decide to go.|`|Lr75hENEaa	egypt. i have been there one year ago and it was very nice|`|ISxdNDeGaa	I've never been to Egypt.   but I can tell you about Jordan, if u r a fan of the historical places, a trip to petra & rum would be a trip that u'll never forget,btw Petra isn't just what u c in pictures, don't be lazy like me, when i went to petra I didn't even try to go inside the caves, which is something that I do really regret. (plus..if u want to go to Petra .. u have to ride a horse ^_^ that was my fav. part lol )    and of course when u visit jordan.. going to aqaba or the dead sea is a MUST ! lol u don't want to miss that, u can do lots of activities in  aqaba.. u have to  spend at least 3 days there.    in amman there are all the coffee shops/restaurants.. the food in general is really delicious, and the city is clean. lol...  don't forget to eat mansaf lol ( jordan's traditional dish) and after that ask for Jobedu's T-shirts , the one that is written on it " I've survived mansaf" ;)    umm..that's it..I'm not really a good guide..i know that :p    edit:  @geriprof : in Jordan there is mount nebo (including the mosaic )that's the first place that came into my mind ..but there are lots of other historical places in Jordan (for muslims, christians,romanians, nabataeans and so ).    @shedy: common shedy..I'm jordanian..am I so mean ?:( lol .. don't generalize :(  but yeah I have to admit that the Egyptians have a great sense of humor :D     Oh btw..now it's 9:40 pm..and I am still awake :$ the streets start to get empty around 11 to 12 o'clock i guess lol    @man i love bulldogs: me myself, I'm not a big fan of the historical places ( actually i find them kinda boring), I've just mentioned them as a reply for geriprof answer, the other places that I've mentioned above ( except petra) aren't historical places.  glad that i've made u laugh :)|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Pyramids of course. You are willing to scarifice one of the ancient (probably modern as well since they still cannot make them up to today)  wonders of the world in order to see Petra??    You must be kidding, right?    Egypt of course is better.    No, I am not saying that Jordan is bad, but in terms of things to see and to do, Egypt is better.|`|496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	You only mention that the tour will take you to either Cairo and the Pyramids at Giza and maybe Saqqarra or Amman to visit the Roman facades of Petra and its surrounding caves that are used by Bedouin herdsman in Jordan.  By that comparison I would choose the Egyptian option.   There is not a lot to see in Amman itself and although Petra is stunning in its own right, it cannot be compared to the the feeling you get when you see the pyramids or the great Sphinx in anyway.  There is no photo or film that can really prepare you for the immensity of these Old Kingdom monolithic stuctures that have stood against time and mans attempt to destroy them.  Even if the tour only takes you to the Giza complex you could fill at least a few weeks seeing all that Cairo has to offer.   The citadal of Salah el Din,Khan el Khalili, Old Cairo,some of the oldest and most beautiful Islamic buildings in the world are to be found in Cairo.There is also the Roman fortress of Babylon,the Cairo Museum, experiencing a felluca ride on the Nile and so much more.   All of these are located in Cairo so you dont need to go wasting money on day tours or hiring guides. You just need to get a copy of The Lonely Planet Guide to Egypt and its all there,maps,prices and recommendations.  Cairo also has a vibrant night life so there is plenty to do and clubs to go to when youve finished sightseeing for the day.  The choice is of course up to you, but I would choose Cairo and the 5,000 year old pyramid complexes far ahead of Roman Petra and Amann.  I am sure which ever you choose you will have a great time and you can always return and visit the option you didnt take.|`|hhhk499qaa	go to the pyramids. you'll have more fun there + you'll discover more things there  have fun & good luck!!|`|0pM85b5Baa	There is no need for comparison, many people can visit both in one tour.   You spend your time in Egypt then go to Petra either by direct flight or stay in Taba or Nuweiba then book your full day tour to Petra from there.     All of the above in case you don't insist on choosing one of 2.|`|BtYglKJwaa	Are you joking, man ?!    Egypt of course...in Egypt you can enjoy alot of things in addition to the great pyramids...and you have varity of several cities..historical or entertainig ones or even enjoy existance of two wonderful seas (mediterranean & Red seas) in addition to River Nile.  Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Aswan, Heurghada, Sharm El-sheikh, St.Kathrine, White desert, Fayium, Porto Marina, Red sea resorts, North coast resorts,...etc. many and many can't count.    Pyramids :  The Great Pyramid of Giza, also called Khufu's Pyramid or the Pyramid of Khufu, and Pyramid of Cheops, is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis bordering what is now Cairo, Egypt,   and is the only remaining member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.     It is believed the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth dynasty Egyptian King Khufu (Cheops in Greek). Constructed over a 20 year period concluding around 2560 BC.   The Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.   Originally the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface, and what is seen today is the underlying core structure.|`|yOpKQcQ8aa	If you have to choose Egypt is better historically. Bsecuase it is not just the Pyramids but there a mixure of history in Egypt (pheronic, Coptic and Islamic)  which you can not find in Jordan.|`|oKE6EyJXaa	I find Petra much more exciting than the Pyramids. Its caves and the view its self is marvelous !! But on the other hand Egypt has many more interesting stuff than Jordan therefore I would reccomend Egypt..You will never get bored here !!

Because:<br>  <br>  1. Muslim didn't reject JESUS - we accept him as MESSIAH (Al-Masih) and APOSTLE. <br>  <br>  But, we reject Christian making 3-Head-Being as God when there is no such evidence in Bible. <br>  Tell me, where "trinity" exist in Bible???<br>  Where Holy Spirit is referred as God??<br>  <br>  Messiah means THE APPOINTED ONE, and GOD is NOT APPOINTED! <br>  Reject Godliness of Jesus didn't told as features of Dajjal in Bible. It is just reject him as Messiah. <br>  You should tell that to atheist and Jews.<br>  According to these verses, they are anti-Christ, not Muslim that called Jesus as “Isa Al-Masih (Isa the Messiah)”<br>  <br>  <br>  2. It is better to be in Islam rather than give up our rationality to embrace Christianity. <br>  First, we might have to hear children fables that can be concluded in a simple way:<br>  <br>  "One God send himself to impregnate his own mother, to be born just to be crucified at the end, due to clear up something that he created by himself called sins." - It sounds stupid isn't it?<br>  <br>  3. We didn't have to choose any of tenth sects of Christianity in Islam. If we enter Christianity, then we need to blow up our own brain for that.<br>  <br>  4. Arab people are Sons of Abraham. They know ALLAH like Jews did, but like Jews, they sway into idolatry. <br>  <br>  Muhammad, Elijah and Elisha were prophets that abolish idolatry. <br>  That doesn't mean Yhwh of Jews is a Fertile God, so do Allah for the Arabs. (thanks for the site)<br>  <br>  5.

kgBPU4xxaa	I live north of Florence. When I go to the Amalfi Coast, I take the train to Naples and then change to the Circumvesuviana train to Sorrento. From there, you can catch a bus or take the boat to go further. Personally, I like the boats.<br>  <br>  As someone else suggested, the Circumvesuviana train to Sorrento also has a stop at Pompeii which is a great place to spend a day. There's also a stop at Erculano which is another town buried by the eruption of Vesuvius.|`|gPE0wRTGaa	Probably driving either the whole way or driving to Naples and taking the train to where you're going along the Amalfi Coast. When you're driving, maybe stop for a few hours in Orvietto, for lunch or something to break up your trip since it's a 4+ hour drive. If you don't want a car at all, take the train from Florence to Naples and then from Naples to Salerno or Sorrento. If you're not the best driver, or don't like crazy roads though, don't drive along the Amalfi Coast. The roads are very curvy and right along a cliff.|`|hBMIeCGbaa	Your best route is to Napoli (Naples) or if you can get a straight train to Sorento.

8kIE1Dswaa	London Overground[1] (LO) is a commuter rail service in London, UK. The London Overground name is the brand applied by Transport for London (TfL) to the services which it manages on four railway lines in the London area: the Euston-Watford DC Line, the North London Line, the West London Line and the Gospel Oak to Barking Line.<br>  <br>  The name has been used since 2007, when TfL took over part of the rail franchise from the Silverlink train operating company. In 2010, it is planned that the London Overground network will also encompass the East London Railway, a line formed from the East London Line (formerly part of London Underground) which is being extended to connect to the North London Line. This section is currently closed.[2]<br>  <br>  London Overground is part of the National Rail network, run as a rail franchise by the train operating company London Overground Rail Operations Ltd (LOROL), but the contracting authority is Transport for London (TfL) rather than central Government. This arrangement is similar to the model adopted for Merseyrail. The lines continue to be owned and maintained by Network Rail except for the Dalston-New Cross section of the East London Railway which will remain TfL property when it becomes an operational part of London Overground.<br>  <br>  London Overground is best described as a commuter rail system, especially as many of the lines share traffic with freight services, although there is an intention to introduce metro-style frequencies eventually on all routes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Overground" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Over...</a><br>  <br>  Though I think the term has also been applied to any railway in London that is not underground.|`|AA11043094	Do you mean the underground? thats the subway system.|`|GAtRIFRnaa	The london overground is a rail company previously silverlink then bought over by transport for london.<br>  It operates over-ground trains within london.<br>  for more info go to<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_overground" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_over...</a>

aqLLbzJQaa	All cards are swiped or placed in a static reader any rate - the 'chip' bit is just an additional security measure used in the UK.  Because 'chipped' cards are so common some inexperienced cashiers will try to tell you they can't take it - stand your ground - there are many people who for various reasons do not have chipped cards - insist and the cashier will provide a slip for you to sign instead.<br>  <br>  ..|`|AxIXg8bmaa	It won't be too much of an issue, they mostly use chip cards but most places can still swipe magnet strip cards.

1Vih78dZaa	There are two aspects to the problem:<br>  <br>  The first difficulty – and the easiest one to solve – concerns how you can actually plug your Canadian standard electrical plug into an Italian electrical socket. This is just a mechanical issue and you should be able to get a travel adaptor from a electrical or electronics shop or department store near where you live.<br>  <br>  The second issue is the difference in voltages and frequency of electricity in North American and Europe. In Canada, your electricity is 110 Volts, 60 Hertz; in Europe, the standard is 220V, 50Hz. If you just plug an American or Canadian appliance into a European electrical socket using one of the adaptors I mentioned above, you're very likely to hear a loud bang, see a bright flash and get a roomful of smoke as your device goes up in flames due to the input voltage being twice what it's designed to handle.<br>  <br>  In order for your gaming system to work in Italy, you need to check the device itself or the adaptor you plug into the wall and make sure it says "220V, 50Hz" as well as "110V, 60Hz". If you can see this on the console or adaptor, you only need to buy the adaptor I mentioned above. If it says only "110V, 60Hz", then you need to either buy a different adaptor from the game manufacturer or go to an electronics store and get a device that you can plug into 220V which outputs 110V and into which you can then plug your gaming device.
zBWefnYHaa	If you are an UK citizen you can, you can even move to Malta without getting married first, as both countries are part of the EU.<br>  <br>  If you have an other nationality, and just a residency permit in the UK it will depend on where you are from, which country gave you your passport.<br>  Most likely you will still be able to live with your wife (after you get married,) but conditions may apply, you will have to sort the paperwork before you marry.<br>  In many cases you will need to apply for Malta visa from your home country, in some cases your country of residence would be acceptable.<br>  The best place to get reliable information is the embassy or consulate of Malta in the UK, or the one for your home country.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You could live with her in Malta anyway, you don't have to get married to live there as a UK citizen. You will need to get a residency permit if you're planning on settling there, and renew it every year, and after a certain number of years you will be permitted to apply for Maltese citizenship. It would be better to have a job there, so you can support yourself and are not a burden on the Maltese economy, so look to your own qualifications and see what you can do to improve your chances. Phone the Maltese Consulate (or Embassy) to find out what documents you'll need to bring with you from the UK to get the residency permit thing sorted.|`|df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	Malta's in the EU. What do you think?|`|3kCQDUUGaa	YES you can

There is also the Imperial Palace, they have good rates and are pretty centralized plus they have a monorail station.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	for mobility problems you are going to want to stay were the trams stop, otherwise it is a hike from casino to casino.  All the mid price hotels are very similiar - Monte Carlo, Mirage, Paris, TI, Planet Hollywood.|`|puyAEPZyaa	I would definitely recommend that you book a room or suite at Bellgaio. Here is my run-down on Bellagio:<br>  <br>  Location: Bellagio is located in the center of the Strip, so you can easily walk or take a taxi, bus, or the Las Vegas monorail to access everything else.<br>  <br>  Atmosphere: Bellagio has a more upscale atmosphere, but is very inviting to all its guests. Bellagio carries more of an Italian theme throughout the resort, so tends to have a more romantic appeal to it.<br>  <br>  Accommodations: Bellagio offers upscale rooms and suites that are elegantly appointed. The staff is very accommodating and the room service is above average. You can't beat a room overlooking the fountains in front of Bellagio. Rooms average $150 a night.<br>  <br>  Casino: Bellagio offers a variety of games and tables to suit anyone.<br>  <br>  Dining: Bellagio offers fine dining, along with casual and contemporary dining. For fine dining, they offer Circo, Jasmine, Le Cirque, Michael Mina, Picasso, and Prime Steakhouse. For casual and contemporary dining, they offer Yellowtail Sushi Restaurant and Bar, Sensi, Olives, Fix, Noodles, the Buffet, and the Cafe. For dessert, they also offer Cafe Gelato, Palio, and Jean Philippe Patisserie.<br>  <br>  Entertainment: Bellagio offers the one-of-a-kind Cirque du Soleil "O".<br>  <br>  Nightlife: Bellagio offers the Fontana Bar, along with the Caramel Lounge and The Bank nightclub.<br>  <br>  Other Amenities: Bellagio also offers a world class spa and salon, high-priced shopping in Via Bellagio and Via Fiore, and a beatiful pool area. Finally, Bellagio also features world-renowned fountains in the front of the resort, a beautiful botanical garden located inside the Conservatory, and an amazing Gallery of Fine Art.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip to Las Vegas!|`|7B9KEqCnaa	try bally's.  Its got nice sized rooms and its right in the middle of the strip.  Its across from the bellagio so you could get a nice view of the fountains and it connects to the paris hotel as well. You can probably get a room for under $100 night there. Bellagio is about $200 a night and the paris is about $150.  All these hotels are right in middle of the strip, whihc is ideal for sightseeing.|`|FWWj3mvLaa	just about any place on the strip is accessible in most respects.there are elevators for those in wheel chairs or elderly/ unsteady, some like the monte carlo need you to Access it from the new entrance as the strip entrance has steps and a rather steep ramp or did as of last year...so does bally's, try the flamingo, ti , mirage, harrahs', some have roll in showers instead of the step in and are roomy with hand held showers and benches....ask when you make reservations, most have the lower toilets for transport from wheel chair to shower but, no hand rails or grab bars by the toilets, caesar's is accessible but holy cow it's like a maze and very frustrating. any how have a good time..if i were you i'd try to see the show o at the bellagio, worth every penny.|`|NnXKDZIsaa	Mirage, dont stay at the Imperial Palace, it's run down.
B2jIiOwnaa	Aaaawwwwww!  Iz so sweeet!  If you're interested in Japan, that's cool.  It'll give you something to share together.  But if Japan's not really your thing, you don't have to teach yourself the language or anything!  Besides, it'd be super hard to learn all that stuff if it was because of someone else's reasons instead of your own.  So my advice?<br>  <br>  Hunt down dating advice from various search engines, or even YahooAnswers (although a lot of the people on the Relationships section are very young).  Once you've got her, show her that you are drawn to her *as an individual* (not just a token girl), by encouraging her in her studies.<br>  <br>  Also, if she's into Japan, chances are...she's an otaku.  Otaku are romantics.  Okay, a lot of them don't like flowers and poetry and stuff....but they do like stuff that is quirky and are attracted to adventure.<br>  <br>  Gambatte ne!|`|eB8tYK1Gaa	Well, if there's a girl you like, that loves stuff like that, then, I think I'd know how to impress her. I LOVVEEE learning that kind of stuff! So if you want to impress her, then try to learn more about it, like, search something for it, because if you know a lot about Japan and stuff, and you show her that you know a lot, you'll impress her. Watch movies, like "Memoirs of a Geisha" if she likes to learn about culture, as in Geishas and a Geisha's tradition, you definitely should watch Memoirs of a Geisha. So just learn more about Japan, and the culture and language. Get a Japanese Phrase Book at Borders. That will definitely help you learn the language. I myself think that the Japanese language is actually pretty cool. btw if you could, try to go on vacation there, take some pics, and show her. You'll learn a lot if you go there, and if you will go there, the best place to go and learn more about Japan, the culture, and language, is Kyoto. The Gion district in Kyoto, Japan. Don't go to Tokyo. So, trust me, this will help because if the girl you are trying to impress is like me, and loves Japan, I know what I'm talking about, I know what a guy can do to impress me, so trust me, it will probably work. And if you do go to Japan, get her like, 2, 3 souvenirs. Like a fan, or, oh this is a good one!! A Silk Kimono!! A Silk Kimono is the best gift you could get her that you could bring back. =]|`|Pst0TRQVaa	you can learn japanese.<br>  or, you can learn about the cultures of japan, so you can have fun while talking about it with her.<br>  or you can get something from japan. she would love that.|`|6wAJJxWwaa	Give a Hello Kitty vibrator - it's the gift that keeps on giving.|`|KovKsiVRaa	Tell her that you use to be Japanese but you quit|`|0ehkP9qMaa	Sing her a song in Japanese or read her a Japanese poem. <br>  or look up what different flowers mean in japan. (like here roses mean you love them)|`|0eT9mNhdaa	....Please dont let such a person reproduce.
