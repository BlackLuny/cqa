Many saying things like, "I would never own a slave personally but I support the right to."  And "Slavery is a guaranteed right from the constitution and the Supreme Court."      Furthermore, the slaves themselves were seen as subhuman and didn't qualify for human rights.      The anti-slavery crowd (mostly republicans) couldn't go allowing with the dehumanizing of the slaves and felt a moral obligation to oppose such an institution.        Isn't this the same argument as used with abortion today?  One person's rights vs another's humanity?

20090203165922AAQrM2k	Politics & Government;Elections	Do Liberals know that they will be paying for this stimulus bill?	WHO GETS WHAT: Taxpayers will pay stimulus costs   AP News   Tuesday, February 03, 2009      While lawmakers and economists debate whether the gargantuan stimulus package grinding through Congress will work, one thing is certain: It will create a hefty increase in the federal debt.      And that will affect us all directly for years, as well as our children and possibly grandchildren. Even if it succeeds in producing enough jobs and consumer and business spending to end the recession, it could lead to a combination of higher taxes, higher interest rates and possibly reduced government services down the road.      The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this year's budget deficit would be a record $1.2 trillion _ about two times that of the year before. This includes financial bailouts and rescue plans approved since last Oct. 1, the start of the government's budget year, but not the big stimulus proposal now before Congress.      And that deficit is just for one year.      Once you carry over government's outstanding deficits from prior years, the total national debt comes to just over $10.6 trillion right now. Every individual in the United States would have to chip in roughly $37,000 apiece to pay it off.      Total federal indebtedness has nearly doubled in just a decade.      The package of public-spending projects and tax cuts that passed the House last week would cost $819 billion over the next two years. The Senate is considering a somewhat different, $900 billion measure.      Without decisive action, President Barack Obama has said, "Trillion-dollar deficits will be a reality for years to come."      If the stimulus package and government industry bailouts work as expected, the surge in federal spending and tax relief will be temporary. When the economy recovers, tax revenues will rise and government social-service spending should moderate. But even if annual deficits return to more normal ranges, the cost of the stimulus package and related measures will long be embedded in the national debt.      Not including new stimulus, the Treasury Department projected that interest payments on the federal debt alone would be about $450 billion this budget year. The stimulus package will add roughly $40 billion more a year.      With the national debt relentlessly rising, interest payments will become an ever-larger slice of the government's total budget pie. Interest on the debt has already become the fourth largest federal spending item behind Medicare-Medicaid, Social Security and defense costs.      The U.S. debt now in the hands of foreign governments _ primarily China, Japan, Britain and Arab oil-producing nations _ is about a third of the total, roughly double that of a decade ago.      Any major flight from Treasuries or other dollar-denominated assets could further rock the global economy and force up U.S. interest rates.      It's hard to believe that as recently as eight years ago there was a budget surplus projected to total $5.6 trillion over ten years. Both incoming President George W. Bush and predecessor Bill Clinton talked about using it to help retire the national debt by the end of the decade. In other words, by the end of this year.      Hardly.      The recession is already shaping up as the most severe since the end of World War II.      Allen Sinai, chief economist of Decision Economics, a Boston-area consulting firm, suggested the stimulus package still may not "be enough for a real recovery this year." He said it will take time for consumers to adjust "after having overspent, overborrowed, undersaved for years and years."      ___      EDITOR'S NOTE _ Tom Raum has covered Washington for The Associated Press since 1973, frequently reporting on the economy.

20090203170234AA93Ezp	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How reliable and accurate are lie detector tests?	Long story short, I found a purse and turned it in to the police station. A few weeks later, however, I was contacted by the police because the person who had lost the purse claimed someone else had apparently found it earlier, stolen a checkbook from it, and had gone on a shopping spree. They asked if I would agree to take a polygraph test to eliminate myself as a suspect, and I readily agreed.      For some reason, however, once I was wired up to the machine, my heart began to race, my mouth went dry, and I couldn't breathe regularly. I'm not sure if it was because I was afraid they would not believe me, or if it was because of the psychological effect of knowing everything I would say would be completely analyzed. It was the true definition of "in the hot seat"      Everytime the polygraph examiner asked me a question, my heart would race even before I would answer. It didn't help that he would ask it in an ominous manner, either.      At any rate, I did tell the truth because I knew I hadn't forged the checks--and I certainly wouldn't be stupid enough to go turn the purse in to the police even if I was the one who had!      When it was over, the examiner told me I was lying through my teeth, and that I had failed every last question. He lectured me like I was the worst person on the planet, then told me to get out of his office.      I know for a FACT I told the truth--I was just nervous about having a machine hooked up to me! How reliable are those machines, honestly? The police said they were 97% accurate, but I am really begging to differ.
20090203170419AAvLoP9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should abortion be legal?	maybe the question isnt legal or illegal, but simply, should it be only the womans choice? 2 weeks ago i was a happily married man, comming up on our 1 year anniversery. Me and my wife fought sometimes, but it was never anything that would tear us apart. So last week she finds out shes pregnant. This is amazing, doctors told her she could never get pregnant! I felt scared, yet blessed and excited. She on the other hand has crumbled, I have never seen the breakdown of a human being so fast in my entire life, literaly moments it took for a 180 shift. she panicked. The things she said to me I wouldnt say to my worst enemy. Now picture this if you will. She wanted an abortion,I didnt. She didnt wanna keep the baby, I did. I was willing to talk to her and here her side of the story, she aparantly didnt want to. She came home last night and informed me that she made the decision for us. She got an abortion, and she packed her bags and left because she says her life is ruined. So imagine the only woman youve ever loved telling you that she hates you, and you ruined her life, and she wants to die, and that your piece of **** is growing inside of her, and she already hates it, and wants to kill it, and if its born, she'll just kill it then. Then she takes matters into her own hands, and kills my kid... its a womans choice though, right? so now,ive lost my wife, and my kid... On top of it, I had called some abortion clinics just asking them to CALL ME if she came in, because i couldnt handle her doing that behind my back, the one she went to was one of the ones i called a few days ago. The best part is? she can barely breath from depression right now, she keeps calling me, beggin me for my forgiveness, telling me she killed her child.. You dont believe me? you think im making this **** up, i dont really care... this is what abortion does to families.. this is what it did to mine, or atleast what could have been mine.

20090203171324AAlkNtH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Roommate moving in furniture and claiming it "off limits."  What can I do?	I recently served an eviction notice to a roommate/subtenant due to overstaying his rental term, theft, lack of cleanliness, and general disrespect to myself and guests.        Even before serving the notice, I took actions to remove all of my usable property (dishes, silverware, any and all food items that don't require freezing or refridgeration) so that he would be unable to steal them without invading my room.  Note, also, that the apartment was very lightly furnished to begin with.        Now, with 28 days left to wait before trial and eventually eviction, he's decided to use his time moving new furniture into the apartment rather than preparing to move out.  Loads of dishes, tables, desks, and other items are appearing seemingly out of nowhere, and he's placing them wherever he wants in the apartment's common areas.  To make matters worse, though, he's claiming them as "off limits" to anybody entering (or currently living in) the house and threatens to go to the cops with charges of theft and/or vandalism if anybody uses said items.  We're talking tables, an entertainment center, and floor lamps here; not consumable items.        For example, if I go out in the livingroom and set a glass on his table, he will threaten to call the cops.  I'm slowly running out of room for any of my own items, and am getting slowly and surely isolated into my own bedroom.  I understand that these items are his personal property, but he's filling the apartment's common areas with this stuff.  Do I have any recourse?  Does he have any ground to stand on insofar as forbidding others to use these items?  What can I do?

The big question being asked lately is should we ban guns, since the badguys have them, or should we let everyone carry guns (which they do allow in Virginia with a permit).  If the students were carrying guns that day they could have at least had a chance and could have fired back at the campusshooter. What do you think?

20090202080434AAcL2kc	Politics & Government;Politics	Will Obama be able to fix the fall out of the inflation bubble with the buy american plan?	In the last 15 years imports have roase 1500% while exports dropped 1100%.The credit debt of Americans has increased along the same lines as there are fewer dollars from GDP going to workers. This meant consumption went up and industry went down. This could be compared to a poor man with baloon loan except it was the retail buisness buying jets and outsourcing customers at the same time.      When you send more then half of your growth to another country it baloons faster then a bad loan. When it fills to much with inflation and credit debt it pops. Then you have no industry, the retailer have a smaller cutomer base, and the banks have more debt then equity.      The only solution that works is to rebuild what every enemy in the world fears American industry and are workers so much better that when even threaten it the crooks around the world scream in fear.       We need to tax non American made goods in stores to make the consumer not want to buy them.      There American made products but the unfair big imports gangsters want to kill are working class.

"While the Presidentâ€™s ratings remain high, the number who Strongly Disapprove has risen from 16% immediately following his inauguration to 24% today.

Why is the Obama administration continuing the kidnap and send to another country who they know will torture them policy that the Clinton administration created?    Now I'm talking real torture, not the water boarding we do to our own troops in training that the democrats redefined as torture so they could say the Bush administration is torturing people type BS. Not playing Springsteen until they want to puke, but real old fashioned splint under the finger nails, beating the feet for hours, hot poker up where you really didn't want it, and all that great stuff type torture.    In fact Obama has made executive order changes so it looked like he was changing things, but he's also maneuvered things so that nothing that was being done is ruled out. He's talking stuff about how we needed to change, but keeping all the same stuff that was being done for decades under democrats and republican administrations.    Obama is making head fakes, not change, except putting all those criminals and "exceptions" to his policy in his administration. That is something new, but the change isn't exactly good, is it?

Am I Ranger material or not?  I've had different opinions.  From people not in the military... telling  me i'm too old and i will never make it.  From my brother and father who say i will have no problem and both of them were in the military.  My father is an ex green beret, and my brother is current intel... he says he knows a bunch of guys that are Rangers and they arn't nothing much.  He said I would have no problem at all with the physical side and since my strength is my mental side it would be right up my alley.  He said the Rangers or the Marines is where I would fit in, but the Marines already disqualified me because I guess they think I'm too old despite my mental and physical toughness.  Not sure what they're looking for, but they cut me off before ever taking a look at me.  So I'm looking into the Rangers.      My current PT SCORES:      120 Push ups / 2 minutes    112 Sit ups / 2 minutes   11:50 / 2 mile run   slightly over 30 minutes / 5 mile run      I have also practiced carring a 50 lb weight in a backpack for 10 mile walks... no problem with that.

Okay, so I withdrew $400.00 from an ATM (not my bank)..  The "Foreign ATM Fee Disclosure" that I had to agree to before I got my cash stated I would be charged $1.75 for the transaction.  Great, I agreed to that..  No problem.  When I looked at my statement today though, they charged me $2.00.  I know I've spent far more the $0.25 stewing about this, and writing this post, but is there some kind of regulatory commission that's setup to protect us against unfair, or misrepresented fees at ATMs?  It's not the $0.25 that I'm upset about, it's the principle of them not being upfront with what I was going to be charged.  Many thanks for your thoughts!

When we moved in there was a very strange smell, it is a smell somewhere between cat pee and mold. We really believe its mold and there is a strange blue coloration on top of the cabinet, they just told me that they would paint over it to seal it. (they have done it twice because the first time didn't work and the second time hasn't worked) Now the blue is seeping through the white (which had a sealing coat on top of it) If they refuse to give us a new cabinet can we call a health inspector or who would we call?

20090202160146AAlOXEP	Politics & Government;Government	Why do the American people need six camps for civilians?	Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., has introduced to the House of Representatives a new bill, H.R. 645, calling for the secretary of homeland security to establish no fewer than six national emergency centers for corralling civilians on military installations.       This is a man who made the following statement just before the election in November:   "If Sarah Palin isn't enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama, then you damn well had better pay attention," Hastings said, as reported by ABC News. "Anybody toting guns and stripping moose don't care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks. So, you just think this through."       The proposed bill, which has received little mainstream media attention, appears designed to create the type of detention center that those concerned about use of the military in domestic affairs fear could be used as camps for political dissidents.       What's the real purpose of these camps? How have we survived without such camps in the past if they are truly for "emergencies"?   Does this concern anybody else?

20090202120313AA1GjQ0	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do some people think that this guy doesn't have the right to sue?	I just saw a clip from the Faux News show "Kelly's Court", in which the host and a couple of panelists discussed a recent lawsuit in which a former Wall Street trader is suing his former employer for firing him for being a vegetarian. Apparently, when the guy's boss found out that he was a vegetarian, he began to constantly harass him about it and he even took to calling him a "homo"!  (By the way, the vegetarian guy is straight and married!) It's obvious that the boss created a hostile work environment in this situation, so why is it that the host and the panelists of this show made light of the situation and mocked the vegetarian guy? After all, I'm sure they wouldn't exactly take kindly to being mocked for their dietary choices or being falsely accused of being gay!

They know the location of my employment from my filing my annual income tax, and lastly; they know my date of birth because I am a US citizen. Geeze!

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

20090202165120AAjhuHn	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	How has major auditing firms signed off on GAAP regarding trillions in these subprime loans?	It amazes me that before signing off with the general accepted accounting principles, it should have required clear footnotes or inserts every quarter for every year. If trillions are hidden, like Enron did, the auditing company is liable. (retired accountant). I think this is illegal and has been illegal for years as these things were done. Many people must pay for all this illegal activity in real estate brokerages, investment bankers, hedge fund traders, and the big auditing firms that must be hired to look at the banksters' books. Either they helped in a cover up or the banksters keep phoney books and fooled the auditors. The bad assets have to be audited, it is the law. Only by signing financial statements that are fraudulent could this be done. The SEC, the audting firms and the banks are all involved in this INCREDIBLE SWINDLE. We the people have been robbed by a creative form of embezzlement and insider trading and the auditors were the last firewall. None of the "bright" people should rewarded. They should be put in prison. Obviously, the are not really so very "bright." They are all expendable. Plenty of fresh new "bright" people are ready to replace those crooked, corrupt "smart" people. It is pure Texas BS about them being "The Smartest Guys in the Room."

20090202163257AAwAZaH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Ringling brothers is now being sued by a few different animal rights groups. What do you think of this?	They  are being sued because Ringling brothers has elephants in their acts, which are an endangered specie. The circus use bull hooks on the elephants and they chain them up while traveling and at night. This case is now in the courts. If Ringling brothers looses, they will no longer be able to have elephants in their shows. OK now for some info. An elephants skin is 1 inch thick. Those bull hooks do not pierce their thick skin. It would be like you tapping someone. If they did not use chains, the elephants would be in more danger then without. Kind of like a toddler left to run around the house by itself. I know this because my son was an elephant trainer for 10 years. He treated his elephants very gently, and never put them in any harm. Ringling brothers also treat the elephants the same way, after all these animals are very important to them. They are also one of the biggest and most successful breeders of elephants in the world. So now that you know a little about elephants, what do you think about this law suit?

Also, is it a pure coincidence that he noticed the error just before the nomination proceedings?  Is it part of the transparency policy Obama has been speaking of?  Could it be Daschel was aware all along he had not paid them, but waited to see if he was going to be picked for the position by Obama?  In other words maybe he thought he could get away with his " honest mistake" to the tune of 128K, more than I earn in 4 years. How do we know in the last thirty years he hasn't done this kind of thing before, or has he finally succumb to the temptations of tax evasion? Could it be he harbored so much hatred toward Bush and his policies, he thought it would be ok to break the law in an effort to keep his earnings from the federal government. On the other hand, maybe it's  just other peoples money he's interested in divying up.

That led to a booming economy in the 1920s.   In 1925, congress cut the top income tax rate to 25%.  That led to the Great Depression that started with a recession in 1929.   From 1929 to 1933, the unemployment rate nearly doubled every year despite the low top income tax rate of 25% (it was reduced to 24% for one year in 1929, then back to 25%).   In 1932 the top tax rate was increased to 63%, unemployment rate was 23%.   In 1936 the top tax rate was increased to 79%, unemployment rate was 17%.   In 1940 the top tax rate was increased to 81%, unemployment rate was 14%.   In 1942 the top tax rate was increased to 88%, unemployment rate was 4.7%   The only two periods in USA history that a severe recession occurred was a few years after the top income tax rate was cut.

I am currently listed as re4 for "Failure to Satisfactory Participation" or something like that. I got it because I didn't turn in my PHA on time. I think re4 is too harsh for that. I didn't purposefully do it. My wife is active duty air force and the notifications were sent to an old address.
20090202120232AAsmHwB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I have a legal case?	Need less to say that I am moving out of these apartments, but I have had nothing but problems since day one that we moved in. During the first inspection of the apartment I advised the landlord that there was a major problem with spiders in the entire apartment and that the counter tops had burn marks on them, nothing was done. Next about two months in to the lease the person above us apartment caught fire and flooded our living room, bathroom, and kitchen area. Still with more to come like nothing else could go wrong, every time that it rains all the windows leak and just a few weeks ago we had a really nice cold front to come through and the windows froze over and showed that they had been growing  mold on them. Last but not least when they notified us that they would be making routine checks on the sprinkler system they ended up doing something to the one in the master bath causing the bathroom to flood (once again) where they had to come back and cut a whole in the ceiling to fix the issue but never repaired the whole. I have contacted the front office about the problems in my apartment and they have done nothing but make the situation worse so I feel that something else needs to be done. I am looking for some legal advise her do I have a case or just wasting my time and I need to just wait till I move to another property?  ( Just in case any of you are wondering the apartment name is Cambridge at Hickory Hollow in Antioch, TN)

I'm not.  That's why I said from the beginning NO BAILOUTS!  But does the government listen to common sense?  Nope.  And our new dumbass President calls it "shameful" when he approved the measure.  How does that work?  He should have seen it coming.  Thoughts?

20090202165707AADirck	Politics & Government;Military	Army marines navy OCS question tattoos?	Went to each of the recruiting stations and I was kind of disappointed with the Marines because they were not giving out waivers for tattoos. I have half sleeves of a Koi and Phoenix that are both above the elbow up to my shoulder, black no color. Marines is my primary choice so I just want to ask you guys is there any way around it? I asked my friend's brother who is a marine in new york and they pretty much said the same thing so am I **** out of luck?      I then went to the Army recruiter but they weren't very helpful. Had some thug pretty much talking about how he has no respect for officers out of college and pretty much kept pressuring my friend and I to just enlist. Didn't even get a chance to talk to a real officer recruiter where as I was able to talk to officer recruiters with the Navy and the Marines.      Lastly, went to the Navy recruiter and found them to be the most helpful and insightful. Apparently they give out waivers for tattoos and told me I have a decent shot at getting in. I really have my mind set on Marines but if that is not possible then I guess Navy is a good choice still too.      My stats just for the record   23   5'7, 175ish lbs   7ish min mile, 20+ pullups decent shape used to compete amateur boxing   bs degree accounting 2.8 gpa   clean record/medical history no surgery etc/no arrests etc.      My main question is there anyone out there with tattoos who successfully went through the process of getting into OCS in the navy/army/marines ? What kind of advice or actions do you suggest I do?      cliffs:   -went to army not helpful. Is it possible to get into the army ocs program with my stats and tattoos if i can find the a helpful recruiter?   -marines my # 1 choice cant get a waiver for tattoos anyone know what i can do to get around?   -navy seemed to be the best in terms of meeting the qualifications and getting in. Does it sound realistic getting into navy ocs with my stats and tattoos?
