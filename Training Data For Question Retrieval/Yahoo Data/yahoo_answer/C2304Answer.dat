hyHvG1Olaa	It is recommended to have science through physics and mathematics through calculus.  It might also be good if you could take any other science classes to provide a good strong foundation.  If you are able to swing AP or IB courses in the aforementioned area it will be a benefit.<br>  <br>  The other thing no one tells you is to volunteer at a local hospital, hospice unit, old folks housing, etc. to gain some valuable experience.  The experiences will help you greatly during the interview process.<br>  <br>  Finally, contact the undergraduate school of your choice and make arrangements if possible to speak with the pre-med adviser,  S/he will be able to provide you with some valuable information to prepare you for the program and also give you sources to go for information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck ...|`|Q5EftYrpaa	Considering the fact that you don't study to become a doctor until college, just take a variety. Most people take a math, science, english, history, and foreign language each year. If you don't take pretty much 4 years of all of these subjects, you probably won't even get into college. If you overload yourself with math and science (taking more than one science class or math) you will get bored and/or stressed. Take Honors math, and science if you want to get good at stuff doctors have to deal with. Honors English is always good too. Really, just do honors if your interested and get recommended for it. But high school is nothing compared to getting a doctorate.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	You should take the classes courses that are recommended or required to get into the college of your choice. Most colleges don't sway much from one another, some just expect a little more. But AP Biology, is highly recommended for the medical profession. As well as all AP and Honors courses to get into colleges. <br>  <br>  Average College Requirements: <br>  4 Years of English<br>  3 Years of Math<br>  3 Years of Science(At least two of the three should be biology, Chemistry, or Physics)<br>  1 Year of Art or Academic Electives, depending on the college<br>  2 Years of one Foreign Language <br>  <br>  Hope that helps some. And best of luck!|`|ivkGknUsaa	I suggest that you take classes in science such as Biology, Chemistry, Human Anatomy/Physiology etc. It's a good idea to take them early so you can advance to AP classes later on. Math classes would be helpful too. Take electives that are designed for those who want to pursue a career in the medical field. If you're not sure what those classes are, your counselor can help you.|`|KjhKHTNfaa	You need to take as many AP classes as you can, to get in to a good college. High school doesn't really count a lot when you want to do something in your future. :O)

rupIlSpDaa	Mike,<br>  <br>  You are not alone.  When I was in college, I seriously thought there was only 1 possible correct answer to every question or problem in the "real" world.  I, too, wondered how I would ever be able to figure out what all these correct answers were.  To some extent, this feeling is a product of your educational experiences to this point.  In grade school, the questions and answers are simple and in many cases there is only one correct answer.  However, in college and in the "real" world questions and their answers become much more complex and varied.<br>  <br>  The key to performing well on exams in this more advance environment is understanding the material well enough so you can explain it to someone else, in your own words.  That is what your professors are looking for.  When you read textbooks, you should concentrate on discovering a framework, model or outline of the ideas and understand how everything fits together.  To help you master the concepts it will help if you can find a study partner and actively discuss the material together explaining to each other what you understand.<br>  <br>  When I was studying my master's degree, I took some classes during the daytime as well as at night.  The students in the daytime classes were primarily full-time graduate students with little practical work experience.  In contrast, the students in the nighttime classes were working business professionals like me.  The tenor and content of classroom discussions between the two classes was like, well, day and night.  During the day, students mostly spit back responses that were practically unvarnished excerpts from the textbook.  At night, however, the discussion was richer and more nuanced by the working experiences of the class members.<br>  <br>  So, don't dispair.  Their is no exact language for answers even when you are studying a textbook.  If you look for opportunities to question and explain what you are learning with another student will be able to put your knowledge into practice and help gain the confidence you seek to perform well on tests.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|AA11688085	my advice would be to try to master the vocabulary first.  go through a chapter at a time, just looking for words you are unsure of. get definitions of these words; make sure that you get definitions that are specific to the field you're studying.<br>  <br>  once you get a rock solid conceptual understanding of the material the words should just flow.<br>  <br>  about the possibility of dyslexia- it is somewhat unlikely that you have it.  if you went to a public elementary school, odds are that you would have already been screened.  <br>  <br>  i am assuming you're in college.  at most universities students can be seen by all types of professionals at no charge.<br>  <br>  you may need a professional, therapy, or medication.  then again, maybe a few sessions with a  tutor (also free of charge at virtually all colleges and universities) would easily do the trick|`|KxefTNDcaa	There is only one textbook, but a hundred different minds in the room. You don't always have to copy everything word by word, change it so it is the most memorable to you. When I read my textbooks I try to remember key parts and not word for word. Remember things in a way that are easiest for you. Maybe your way is word for word, but everyone else has their unique ways.<br>  That is pretty interesting...

Make sure that it is s fully qualifying law degree and you will graduate with an LLB because anything else will mean you would have to do a conversion course. <br>  <br>  When you graduate you will need to do the Bar Vocational Course to become a Barrister or the Legal Practice Course to become a solicitor. <br>  <br>  If you do the LPC then you'll need to spend a couple of years training in a solicitor's office before you are fully qualified.

Then again, the entertainment industry is a big business having a double major in business and music will help you so much if you chose to work in the entertainment industry.  See if you can double major in music and Business. I am sure you can do that as long as the school offer both majors. The only thing is some school only offer one degree, so you might have to chose a Bach in music or business. This all depends on your school.

As for GPA, nearly 95% of the student body had a GPA of 3.25 or above (only 5% of the students had a GPA of 3.24 and below). <br>  <br>  This means you would have to have other standout qualities. Other important admission factors include the difficulty of classes you've taken at community college, extracurricular activties, talent, work experience, personal qualities, and volunteer work.<br>  <br>  You have a lot cut out for you, so if and when you do apply, be sure to add anything extra that will make you stand out from the crowd. If you happen to stick around community college for one more year, try to bring your GPA up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The rest of Europe, including all the mainland, drive on the right.<br>  <br>  Regardless of all the myths and urban legends, there doesn't actually have to be a particular reason. They had to chose one side to avoid collisions. Some jurisdictions chose right, some chose left. As a matter of fact, in the very earliest days of motor vehicles it was left up to local city authorities so several countries had a mix of both. This was the case in Italy where several major cities, like Turin, actually drove on the left for several years. The development of first inter-city and then international travel led to a generalization of national laws in this regard.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Cars drive on the right hand side of the road in most European countries, just like in USA.<br>  <br>  Some countries which drive on the left are:<br>  Australia<br>  New Zealand<br>  Japan<br>  India<br>  Hong Kong<br>  South Africa<br>  <br>  and lots and lots of other smaller, lesser-known countries.<br>  .|`|66fJYDJaaa	Think of a Roman chariot, or any horse drawn vehicle.

If you want to apply and start medical school immediately after graduating from college, you need to take your MCAT during that time period.  If you do well on the exam, you only need to take it once.
Un3YxFvRaa	<a href="http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/capote,-truman-1-c-1but1xtuy9" rel="nofollow">http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/ca...</a><br>  <br>  The heavily corrected manuscript of the short story "House of Flowers," one of Capote's finest achievements. This critically acclaimed story, set in a Haitian bordello, was first published in Rome in Botteghe Oscure in 1950. It was then published in this country in Mademoiselle in April 1951. Later that year it was given the O. Henry Award. It was first collected in Breakfast at Tiffany's: A Short Novel and Three Stories (1958). The story was later made into a Broadway musical (see lot 418).<br>  <br>  In 1948, Capote went to Haiti on assignement for Harper's Bazaar. The trip produced a travel article, which was published that year and was later collected in Local Color. Capote spent a good many of his evenings in Port-au-Prince sitting on the porches of the bordellos, passing the time gossiping with the local prostitutes. Two years later, living in Sicily, he used the stories he had heard to fashion one of the best short stories of the mid-20th century. The present manuscript is a crucial early draft, offering a fascinating glimpse of Capote's working methods. Capote has signed his name in full on the front free endpaper of the notebook; on the blank leaf just before the beginning of the story, he has written, almost as an epigraph, "as though tiny fish were swimming in her veins." (In the story, Ottilie asks Rosita how it feels to be in love. "Ah, said Rosita with swooning eyes, you feel as though pepper has been sprinkled on your heart, as though tiny fish are swimming in your veins.") The corrections and changes to the story itself are extensive.

Aglets keep the fibers from unraveling, and their firmness and narrow profile make them easier to hold and feed through the eyelets, lugs or other lacing guides of the lace or cord...Aglets today are most often made of clear plastic, but in times past aglets were made of metal, glass, or stone. Many were highly ornamental, and made of precious metals such as silver. Before the invention of buttons, they were used on the ends of ribbons to fasten clothing together. Sometimes they would be formed into small figures...For a time during the Great Depression aglets were made out of paper and glue.An aglet can be fashioned out of adhesive tape, wax, resin, glue, thread, heat shrink or metal tubing, or by simply knotting or melting the end of a lace or cord"|`|7FfE1Gwbaa	its called in aglet

lQIKWXDuaa	First off, all the questions that you ask are a matter of preference. That said  I will share mines with you and tell you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it better to go to a big or a small college?<br>  For me it is better to go to a small college. It give you the faculty and staff there an opportunity to get to know their student. This is important when you need letters of recommendation from them in the future for graduate school or a job.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it better to go far from home or stay close?<br>  <br>  It is better to stay close to home if you have supportive family members. Like when you are sick mom and dad can help bring you back to health. It is easier to go home on weekends. If you need a hot plate, you can just drop home. If you need to get away from your roommates to study for an exam or the distracting party scene you can go home and do that.<br>  <br>  City, town, or suburban?<br>  It all depends on you and what atmosphere you like. I went to college in the city it was ok. <br>  <br>  <br>  From your experience,<br>  Did you regret the choice of where you went to college?<br>  No not at all. I visited the school way before attending it to see if I like it and I did. I suggest that you visit the school. Sit in one of the classes. Stay overnight to see what it is like.  Visit it during a weekday and on a weekend day as well. Life on campus differ depending on whether or not it is a weekday or a weekend. On weekend most of your peers might go home or they might stay on campus depending on the trend on the university.<br>  <br>  Did you like it better than high school?<br>  yes I did. For one thing,  you create your own schedule. I went to school two days a week. Either, Mondays and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday. Also, you chose what courses to take. You chose your major and what you want to concentrate your studies on.<br>  <br>  Did you feel as though you grew as a person in more ways than just intellectually?<br>  Yes, I was a lot smarter when I enter college than when I entered it. I learn so much about science. I was a Biology major/premed<br>  Did you make friends easily? Were you able to find people similar to you? <br>  I did meet lots of people.

F0UF9DDeaa	Keep in mind that Electricians are one of the highest paid jobs in The USA right now. You can find this information on top jobs. The are above executives and below anesthesiologist listed on this site.Union Electricians in the North East --- Where the Union is strong make between 80,000.00 and 130,000.00 a year... That is working new construction and shutdowns. In the South where the union is basically irrelevant since the right to work law passed in the 70's and 80's make between 40,000.00 to 60,000 a year doing the same type work. Doing any type of electric work in construction pays bring home $1,000.00 to 1,300.00 per week. in other areas of the skilled trade you can make between 15.00 per hour and 30.00 per hours paid. Hope this helps. <br>  When you get your union book there is a hotline of upcoming jobs listed where you can boom out. You can then pick and choose the jobs you want to go on by the pay they are offering journey men.

Book/Movie reviews are informative speeches.<br>  <br>  You can "google" Informative Speech topics and see what that produces.|`|1gyzz3kxaa	The informative essay is one of the most challenging of all writing assignments. You essentially take on the role of teacher/expert for a general audience that, you have to assume, is unfamiliar with your topic or thesis. This puts a lot of pressure on you to be both informative and interesting. All you have to do, however, is plan out your essay and structure it in a certain way that entails less stress for you and more enjoyment and satisfaction when writing it.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Decide on a topic that you think is important and that your readers could benefit from knowing more about. The example we'll use is eating disorders. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Write down a tentative thesis statement. What is it that you want to share with your readers? Don't obsess about it too much at this stage, as you will likely have to revise your thesis somewhat as you conduct your research and write the actual essay. Just try to write down something specific and (hopefully) interesting.Such as, eating disorders lead to a large number of preventable deaths. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Draft an outline listing all the questions you have about your topic, all the things you think you know about it, and any personal experiences or observations you may have. For instance: How many people suffer from eating disorders? How many are men and how many are women? What age group suffers from them the most? What's the most common eating disorder? <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Research your topic online and in the library. Find authoritative, credible sources. To learn more about eating disorders, you could go to the National Health Information Center and National Eating Disorders Association. You could also interview doctors and people who have personally suffered from these disorders. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Write your essay. Begin the opening paragraph with a hook to lure the reader's interest. Use this paragraph to provide a lead-in to the topic and some general context for the issue to be discussed. One possible hook that might work for our example: Anorexia is the leading killer of teenage girls. <br>  <br>  Step 6<br>  Use the body of your essay to inform your reader about the specifics of your topic. Provide interesting details that they likely don't already know, or present common knowledge in a new light.<br>   <br>  Step 7<br>  Conclude your essay by summarizing the knowledge you've shared.

s8QbZ0RLaa	I guess you need help on HOW to solve it then. :)<br>  <br>  Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b<br>  m = slope<br>  b = y-intercept<br>  <br>  1. You have to move around the parts so it's in the slope-intercept form.<br>  <br>  3x + 4y = 12 (subtract 3x from both sides)<br>  <br>  4y = -3x + 12 (divide by 4 on both sides)<br>  <br>  y = -3/4x + 3<br>  <br>  Your slope is -3/4 and your y-intercept is 3.<br>  <br>  Make sense? Try the second one using these steps and see if you get the right answer. :)|`|QtJ0cKjGaa	The slope-intercept equation is y = mx+c<br>  <br>  where m=slope and c=y-intercept<br>  <br>  1) 3x+4y = 12<br>  <br>  => 4y = -3x+12<br>  <br>  => y = (-3/4)x+3<br>  <br>  Therefore, slope = (-3/4) and y-intercept = 3<br>  <br>  Hope this helps:-)|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	1. 3x+4y=12 First, for the x, y will equal 0 bc at the intercept, it is on the x axis, which would be 0 in the y. so you have<br>      3x+4(0)=12, which is the same as 3x=12. So you divide by 3 on both sides, which will give you x=4. Then you do the y the same way.<br>  3(0)+4y=12, or 4y=12. Divide by 4, and you get y=3. So your answer is (4,3), or x=4, y=3.<br>  <br>  As for slope: The equation for slope is Y2-Y1/X2-X1. If you don't know how to do slope, that probably made no sense. so you will probably do best to graph those intercepts and look at it. I labeled (0,3), the y intercept, 1, and (4,0), the x intercept, 2. So the y from 2 (0) will be Y2, the y from 1 (3) will be Y1, and so on. So you will have 2-3/4-0, which leaves you with -1/4.

The top schools reject more qualified applicants than they accept -- so it isn't surprising that you were rejected from some of those schools.<br>  <br>  If those schools found out that you were accepted to Harvard and knew that you would probably turn them down, they might reject you in order to increase their yields.  One of the factors that is used in the ratings is the percent of applicants who enroll.  If they thought you would not enroll, they might reject you for that reason.|`|3VD8fWF8aa	There are so many different reasons schools wil take students.

Maybe your essay struck a chord with the Harvard admissions officer and not the others.  Maybe the Harvard person favors your hobbies, or you location.  Maybe all of the above or more.  It just goes to show how complex the admissions process is.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.|`|qTcbPuahaa	wow, congrats,, <br>  <br>  maybe it's because of sports, some of those schools take sports into greater consideration than Harvard<br>  <br>  :( I wish I had applied to Harvard, but didn't try thinking I had no chance<br>  <br>  Every school is different, they take the students that catch their attention, and I guess the other schools didnt see what Harvard saw in you.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Maybe it's cause your father went to Harvard and your grandparents are on the board of directors?|`|tLO9DN2Waa	For some really great non Ivy League schools, there's this person they call an 'overqualified applicant.' Basically, its a student who is a fantastic student, great grades and extracurriculars and someone who they'd really want on their campus. But because this student is great, they think that they'd have a high chance of getting into an Ivy League, so they don't accept them in order to try to keep their yield (how many students attend the school compared to how many were offered seats) high.<br>  On the other hand, there are some students who schools just don't think would be a good fit, even if they are incredible students- they just might not fit the 'typical mold' that the college is looking for.<br>  Congrats on being accepted to Harvard!|`|aTkAzkLnaa	maybe there were better students that applied at those schools and none that applied to Harvard?<br>  I mean, there could be a lot of reasons, from what I've seen so far, in the U.S., colleges are not only looking for 1 thing (like tests scores), they make their own choices and they look at different things and choose the students that will fit with their schools..|`|qIGzjRwUaa	It depends on what the school is looking for. Maybe their star pianist just graduated and you play the piano, or they're losing a lot of football players and you play football. It depends on what kinds of people they need in their school, for a certain club or major or sport.

aW7JLj0Caa	Okay, I did some research and this is how you're supposed to write "a response to literature"<br>  <br>  1) An intro that explains one of the themes <br>  2) A well developed personal connection to the story that includes concrete examples<br>  3)  A conclusion that sums up the response. <br>  <br>  So this is an outline of what I would do:<br>  <br>  1)  theme: Impulse can change someone's decisions, whether good or bad. Alberto's personalities before and after his realization were drastically different. (Maybe include quotes.)<br>  2) An example: list your experience, this can be in first person, but try to make it revolve around the theme, don't just narrate. <br>  3) Bring everything together by comparing how the theme in the story connects with your personal experience. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!

FmvnC8keaa	Well I cannot help you with the exact quote part because I do not have a play script right in front of me, but for the other question you could put something like "A statement that expresses the theme in A Christmas Carol (underline the book title) about how ignorance causes problems in life is when you are having a problem in your life, for example your parents may have gotten a divorce or you may have just gotten into a fight with a loved one and you try to tell someone but they do not listen to you, you may feel sad and as though that person does not care about how you truly feel. Thus so, you may end up feeling as though nobody does care about how you feel, and that your feelings do not matter. This, although, is not true. Just because one person does not care enough to listen to you, does not mean that your feelings do not matter, and chances are there will be people out there who do care about your feelings." You could say something aong those lines, but turn it into how Scrooge was not helping out any of the people coming to his door asking for donations for the poor. He thought that they all deserve to be working in those sweat shops solely because they were poor. I am sure there will be a direct quote of Scrooge saying something that will proove that point, in fact I know so. You just have to look a little for a quote that will go with what you are saying. Do not forget your parenthetical citation. (The author's name and then the page number you found the quote on before you end the sentence with a period in these (). For example - "The cat ran outside of the house and a man was shocked to see such a thing" (Rand 72). Hope this helps :)

eeP9Xp8Laa	It is definitely a good thing.<br>  My parents were not the type I could tell anything to. My 6th grade math teacher and I became really close. I could and still can talk to her about anything. I am also in 8th grade. My parents went through a lot of stuff and have split up twice since 7th grade, and this teacher was there for me the whole way to guide me and be there for me. I consider her basically to be my adoptive mom, sortof. She has even said that to me, because I do not really care much about my parents.<br>  She knows more about me than a lot of my friends and my own parents. It is not abnormal at all, as long as you don't cross boundaries. I think texting/calling/emailing is fine because I've done the same with this teacher. But, you just have to be careful what you tell them because there are certain things they must report no matter what. And, you have to be careful how personal you get and not ask them super personal questions about their life.<br>  I still talk to her.

W1xs3vYBaa	Cafe's are always good, especially if you have ear plugs. Often people get bored at libraries and need to have a bit of noise and commotion to study. The cafe is a socially acceptable place to study that will deliver this. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, it is best to do it at your home (never the bed room, or else you will associate it with learning which can interrupt sleep patterns) and you should study in the same place every time to associate that spot with work. It will increase your retention.|`|U8H3q0qQaa	For me, the best place is deep in the recesses of my college library, where its quiet and I feel the studiousness overtake me.

lQIKWXDuaa	Ha, that is a very good question. You should really pick a class schedule booklet from your school and see if classes are spread out. Every school is different. In my college, for each of the course that they offered you always had the option of taking it Mondays and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday as well as what time of the day like morning, evening or nights. <br>  <br>  Also, when I was in college some of friends were in their thirties and forties. Dont worry about that. People go to college at different age. The most important thing is to keep your eyes on the prize which is you want a better life for yourself.<br>  <br>  Now that I am going back to school this Fall for a different degree and I am almost thirty, we are in the most boat. I will have to retrain myself to get back into the routine of school. <br>  <br>  See if you can start in the spring of 2010. Drop by the college that you are interested in and speak with someone in the admission's office. You might still be able to start in the Fall. Good luck in college.<br>  <br>  ss|`|cJRFbZUaaa	There are lots of options for an accounting degree or designation.  Every professional accountant has at least one designation.  Your local area should have accounting associations that oversee the credentials, such as the Chartered Accountants or Certified Management Accountants.  The university will also have information for students. <br>  <br>  My brother earned a Certified General Accountant (CGA) designation and a Bachelor of Technology degree in his mid-30s.  He took night classes at a local polytechnic college while working during the day.  As he progressed in his courses, he got accounting jobs with more responsibility.  The polytechnic had Fall, Winter, and Summer terms, and students could start and graduate at any term.  He registered with the CGA body as a student, and they gave him credit for his college studies and also offered courses of their own, so he completed his designation within a year of obtaining his degree.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	I'm only 20, but I can answer some of your questions.  First of all, it really depends on the University for their time frame and how flexible they are on offering classes into the night and such.  I know at my University they offer classes from 8-8pm pretty much.  Also, Friday is not a day that is typical classes are held on.  So alot of people at my school set up their schedule to only go to school on Mondays and Wednesdays or Thursdays and Tuesdays to accomodate for work the rest of the week.<br>  <br>  Also, you should start working on the enrollment process because most universities allow you to sign up at the spring semester if you want, so you can jump in at Janurary 2010.<br>  <br>  I don't know how tech school was for you, but at Universities it's usually all the kids that want to learn and all the jerks that judge and make fun of people couldn't make it to higher education.  So don't worry about being older than most of the students, almost no one cares who's older and what not.<br>  <br>  My guess the hardest thing for you to go back is just getting back in the routine of school since you've been out of that system for a while.<br>  <br>  But good luck!|`|MNus8Qsiaa	Unfortunately, I am a teenager. But my mother is 43 years old. About 5 years ago, she decided to start college, because she had never been able to finish high school (she was married young). I am truly inspired by her strong will and the way she manages everything. On top of everything, she is a single mother. She has been able to do it (she graduates simultaneously as I graduate from high school in 2010!!) with a little bit of help from me and my siblings. She has been stressed, but she also works to get the salary. But if you will not be working, or have to worry about a family or any responsibilities, then I think you will certainly be able to do it. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope that you will be able to achieve your goal, just like my mom!<br>  As for your questions, from what I know, it depends on which university you apply to. However, most universities let you choose the number and type of classes. You may have 4 classes total in a week, spaced out 1 each day, or even all in 1 day. Classes spread out are actually good because you get time to do your hw and study. You might want to narrow down your university choices to a few, and then see if they will accept you in Jan 2010 or if you have to wait. Then, make your final choice depending on that and other concerns of yours. You can still make it in fall 2010 and be fine; in fact it might be better b/c you'll be new like other freshmen, so it might be better to adjust. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped somewhat. Good luck once again, and I wish you the best of luck for your wonderful future!

If she is struggling in that class, but improves over the year, that might look better.

Astrophysicists work on that and also the physics of everything else in the universe - stars, galaxies, etc.  But there's really no degree in just cosmology; a cosmologist will be a physicist or an astrophysicist because that's what their degree is in.  It's just what they work on that makes them a cosmologist.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in either, you'll need a PhD in physics or astrophysics - start with a physics major at whatever college or university you end up going to, and take a lot of math, computer science, and astronomy courses as well.

This is how I would approach this project:  I would google how many different languages are spoken in the world.  This will be difficult, because in Alaska, there are only two women remaining who's speak this one particular dialect of Eskimo, but, yes, that counts as a language.  The same is true for some Native American languages--they are dying out quickly.  Anyway, once I have done that, I would try to discover what language is spoken by the most people in the world (This will probably Chinese, because it is the most populous nation--but that 's just a calculated guess on my part.)  Then I would predict, (from what I've read and discovered so far) what language wil be the PRIMARY spoken form of communication in the next decade or two--and my best guess on that is English, because ALL airplane pilots and airport towers already use English as their primary language.  I do not know if this will fulfill the requirements of your assignment--it is just what tI would do, and what I think|`|XHCoIo3zaa	You might want to give examples of what has happened to people as a result of learning a new language.

9NSfJChaaa	Your teacher has the right to change his mind whenever he wants to.  That's a privilege of being a teacher.  Just the same as he can give you a pop quiz whenever he wants to he can choose to review an assignment that he said would not be collected.  It is usually a way of making sure that an assignment, project, etc is completed despite him not telling you it will be collected.  Teachers used to do this to us all the time.  Just carry the binder with you next time... it's just one extra thing to carry.<br>  <br>  Get used to that kind of thing... especially if you plan to go to college.  Many instructors will make it seem as if something is not a high priority, or you have endless amounts of time to complete something and they will then ask for it that day, test you on it or ask you to present it to the class.|`|MwvA8v17aa	the name thing is completely ridiculous<br>  tell your guidance counselor & they keep you anonymous <br>  <br>  and the binder check thing - yeah, its wrong, but he never said you shouldn't bring your binder so technically he has the right even though he was a jerk about it<br>  <br>  but if thats your only B i'm confident you'll get an A, and you sound like youre working really hard so you'll end up fine, trust me!|`|LbGRsCTKaa	I'm sure there's more to this story than what's written here.

Is it his policy that you bring your binder regardless of what he might say the day before in regards to a check or no check? Does he believe you should bring your binder everyday? If so then yes you should receive your punishment for the class. If he normally says to bring your binder only when your going to be having checks, then no. But I'm thinking, just for the fact that he even has something called a "binder check" that means you should always have it on you in his class.|`|sD5KyGLGaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I think you should go to your teacher at some point after class, and try to get him alone. Explain your dilemma as you have here, and demand (Yes, DEMAND) that you do not lose the marks.<br>  <br>  If he continues with this behavior, go to your principal, vice-principal or even a member of your school board and make a direct complaint about this vendetta (that's what it seems to be).<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|hi8cyFmRaa	i have a teacher like that too, she picks on me for no reason, tells me to shut up when im not talking, she hates me, and i hate her|`|Lat2BDgeaa	Nooo!

lQIKWXDuaa	What exactly do pharmacists do?<br>  "Pharmacists distribute prescription drugs to individuals. They also advise their patients, as well as physicians and other health practitioners, on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications. Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Compounding—the actual mixing of ingredients to form medications—is a small part of a pharmacist’s practice, because most medicines are produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form. Most pharmacists work in a community setting, such as a retail drugstore, or in a health care facility, such as a hospital, nursing home, mental health institution, or neighborhood health clinic.<br>  <br>  Pharmacists in community pharmacies dispense medications, counsel patients on the use of prescription and over-the-counter medications, and advise physicians about patients’ medication therapy. They also advise patients about general health topics such as diet, exercise, and stress management, and provide information on products such as durable medical equipment or home health care supplies. In addition, they may complete third-party insurance forms and other paperwork. Those who own or manage community pharmacies may sell non-health-related merchandise, hire and supervise personnel, and oversee the general operation of the pharmacy. Some community pharmacists provide specialized services to help patients with conditions such as diabetes, asthma, smoking cessation, or high blood pressure; others also are trained to administer vaccinations.<br>  <br>  Pharmacists in health care facilities dispense medications and advise the medical staff on the selection and effects of drugs. They may make sterile solutions to be administered intravenously. They also plan, monitor and evaluate drug programs or regimens. They may counsel hospitalized patients on the use of drugs before the patients are discharged.<br>  <br>  Pharmacists who work in home health care monitor drug therapy and prepare infusions—solutions that are injected into patients—and other medications for use in the home.<br>  <br>  Some pharmacists specialize in specific drug therapy areas, such as intravenous nutrition support, oncology (cancer), nuclear pharmacy (used for chemotherapy), geriatric pharmacy, and psychiatric pharmacy (the use of drugs to treat mental disorders)."<br>  <br>  what is the schooling like? <br>  Well, there is no major in college. What you do is you complete all the requirements for pharmacy school. You must take the PCAT exam.  Most schools require that you have a minimum of 60 college credits. Once you get into pharmacy school, you complete all the required courses so that you can take the licensing exam and practice as a pharmacist.<br>  <br>  For more information go to the link below.<br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos079.htm#nature" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos079.htm#natur...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pharmcas.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmcas.org/</a><br>  <br>  ss<br>  ss

gb9REJN4aa	You can organize your review to show an intellectual trajectory or a development of thought processes on the subject. Instead of organizing it around a debate in the literature, you could alternatively focus on the ways that the literature itself has expanded its scope or come to consensus about the best ways to refurbish. For example, you might say something like, "As late as 1998, Author and Author suggested that brick buildings needed extra fiberglass insulation to improve their heat efficiency, but now the literature generally agrees with Author who showed conclusively that reflective insulation works even better." (Obviously, I know nothing about this topic and am making up my examples with wild abandon.)    The other thing you could do is broaden the topic of your literature review. Instead of trying to find conflicting arguments within the confines of sustainable refurbishment, perhaps you could juxtapose the arguments of those who are thinking about sustainability with those whose main emphasis is on something else. For example, surely there is some literature that privileges things like profitability, cost-effectiveness, or aesthetics/style over sustainability considerations.|`|45deb346668a7b66aee588c0399444f9aa	If there is no conflict then say that there is no conflict. Write a large section on what the bulk of things say and then look for anything that is very new and can be explored further, end by talking about what future research could be done.|`|QwbmE07faa	Unfortunately i do not know much about your chosen topic! But i could advise you on basic things such as:    Always have an introduction and conclusion (may seem silly, but it's ridiculous how many people lose marks on this).    Keep your essay simple, don't attempt to use words you are unsure about.    Avoid waffling points. Start with one point and explain it in as much detail as you can. You don't want to go back to a point and explain it unless it links with another point.    Ensure your essay has a natural flow and each point follows on.    Use good grammar and punctuation.    Avoid the first person pronoun 'I', only use it in your conclusion.    I must stress although it may seem obvious:    Your introduction must re-word the question, state how you will approach it and what points you will discuss.    Your conclusion must sum up all the points you made. Clearly state your overall view on the topic.     For extra marks, a 2,000 word essay should have at least 2-4 references.    Make sure you do a Bibliography.    You can't go wrong! Good luck.

The highest active volcano in Europe, its elevation is more than 10,000 ft (3,200 m); its base has a circumference of about 93 mi (150 km). Mount Etna has repeatedly erupted over the centuries, most violently in 1669, when the lava flow destroyed villages on the lower slope and submerged part of the town of Catania. Activity was almost continuous in the decade following 1971, and in 1983 an eruption that lasted four months prompted authorities to explode dynamite in an attempt to divert lava flows. Mount Etna also experienced violent eruptions in 2001  02, prompting the Italian government to declare a state of emergency.    Columbia Encyclopedia: Etna     Etna or Aetna (both: ?t'n?) , volcano, 10,958 ft (3,340 m) high, on the east coast of Sicily, S Italy. It is the highest active volcano in Europe. The shape and height of its central cone have often been changed by eruptions. There are more than 260 lesser craters on the slopes, formed by lateral eruptions. The southeastern slope is cut by a deep (2,0004,000-ft/6101219-m), precipitous cleft, the Valle del Bove. The first known eruption occurred in 475 B.C. and was described by Pindar and Aeschylus.

My guess is that the word refers to a three-letter word used in slang to refer to the buttocks.  the spelling may deliberately have been done incorrectly in order to avoid the asterisks on Yahoo! Answers coming on in its place.  Teh problem with the words being replaced by asterisks, even when they are legitimate words used in a politite and inoffensive manner, has been an ongoing problem in Yahoo! Answers.  The word might also refer to a donkey.  Possibly the asterisk was placed after two of the words for added emphasis.  The answers are only guesses.  You really would have to ask the person who used the notation what it really meant.    Some people try to beat the stars coming on the screen in place of words by putting in the stars themselves.  LOL  I guess they maybe feel they are getting back at the Yahoo! Answers system by using their own tactics against them.    The asterisks really take the place of italics, because the Yahoo!

TWKIuTEyaa	The context would help us to suggest alternatives.    Learnable exists, and is a perfectly acceptable word.
WRvwnBmIaa	Woah? 7th? Slow down sweetie. The earliest someone should study is 9th grade. The reason why is because a majority of the vocabulary and mathematics on the SAT & ACT are usually being to be taught start in 9th grade.<br>  <br>  2. There's tons of free SAT prep sites. I would recommend purchasing the SAT prep guide from College Board since they manage SAT registration and distribution of scores. I can't remember the website but there's this great one that gives you a lot of SAT and ACT sample questions and they even email you a question of the day.<br>  <br>  3. I haven't taken the SAT yet and I'm a junior right now.<br>  <br>  4. My advice is to just chill and relax. Learn your vocabulary because I hear it's a major part of the SAT. Don't worry so much about prepping for the test now, you have no need to prep for it. SAT prep is offered at a lot of high schools for a cost but the prep programs offered are a big help. High school isn't all about test scores and grades remember to have fun too. Universities do look at your SAT scores but you could have a perfect score and get rejected for not having things like extra curricular activities and volunteer work. Also don't psyche yourself out about the test many people do it and preform horribly. If you have test taking anxiety then attend a workshop to help deal with it.|`|QD54HVsPaa	You are wise beyond your years!  Definitely start studying the SAT vocab now.  It will be much easier to learn 500 new words in the next 4-5 years than to try to learn them in one year.<br>  <br>  Study greek and latin roots; that's where most of our words come from.<br>  <br>  Search SAT online.  There is an online course you can take, as well as other in-class courses you can take at a later date.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.  and be sure to take the PSAT when you are in about the 11th grade|`|v5sZUSD0aa	If you are only in seventh grade, you honestly have nothing to worry about right now except maybe starting to decide which highschool you will attend. The best advice I can give you is to read like there's no tomorrow. You'll read quicker, your vocabulary will increase, and your comprehension will get better. These will all help you on the English portions of the test. PSAT/SAT prep classes helped me, but nothing can truly prepare you for the test. Just work hard in school and suck up all the information you can in the next 3 years, they'll go by much quicker than you'd expect! In my opinion, math was the hardest...but I am just not a math person ;} Everyone has a different experience because the tests are all different.|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	RELAX. <br>  <br>  ur in 7th! i'm in 8th and i don't need to worry. <br>  <br>  When it's close to SAT time, i will join an SAT prep corse and thats what you should do.<br>  <br>  Just pay attention in class!|`|eeP9Xp8Laa	I am in 8th grade.<br>  <br>  1-If you saved your notes throughout the year, look over all your notes. Just read them. If you learned it once, it will be a review and so it will stick in your head.<br>  <br>  2-Google-example 7th grade SAT. I did this last year, and it gave you what would be on the test. I found an example of one and there were a few things in math I'd forgotten how to do. I just types in 7th grade math ARMT(the alabama test) and the second link on there was the example. You must click view as HTML so you won't have to download<br>  <br>  3. Many people are bad at math. Though math is my easiest suject. But for LA stuff, I think the written answers are the hardest. Or, anything that has to do with reading something. The grammar and such is very easy. The vocab was also easy for me. I didn't miss on. I used a lot of the elimination process to find my answer.<br>  <br>  4. When you get it, don't stress. Just think"I know how to do this, I can do it" For real, no kidding, take a deep breath and concentrate. If you stress and freak out you will forget easy things and mess up. If you come to a problem you've forgotten how to do, use common sense. Use other things you've learned to help you figure it out. NEVER leave an answer blank. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.|`|uxy4k4uYaa	1) Personally, the 7th grade *may* be a little soon to start studying up. You don't need to worry over it so soon! I started in about the 10th grade. That's when I took my first PSAT. I took my first SAT April of my junior year (11th grade)<br>  <br>  2) Great courses come with a price. I used an online course by the Princeton Review, which cost me about $1000. Some people will get private tutors, and some will just buy a few books. The basic thing you need to know is *how* to ace the SATs, and what sorts of questions will be on there. Remember, it's supposed to measure your intelligence, so it's not something you can greatly improve.<br>  <br>  3) I'm in mostly honors classes, and I found the vocabulary section somewhat challenging. One *big* piece of advice I'd give you is to read lots of books. Books you like, and enjoy reading. Believe me, your vocab will increase. Also, study up on roots of words. This way, even if you don't know a word, you can always pick it apart to try to get an understanding of what it means.<br>  <br>  4) In my opinion, the critical reading was the hardest part, and it showed, because I scored lowest on that portion. The math I found simple. What I suggest you study most is vocab/grammar. Try typing online with proper sentences; it helps a lot!<br>  <br>  5) Don't be worried about this test. Because, with preparation, you'll master the ways to take it! This one test shouldn't bring you down either. It's not a very accurate way to measure intelligence, because you can boost your score! But really, don't worry about this until at least high school.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|a75f02eb0a9b8fc6e5dbeaa5b35fa874aa	okay-- im going to start off by saying that i'm a junior and have not done anything for it yet. & its not like im an idiot. i hold a gpa of 4.5 and got a 32 on my practice ACT<br>  so-- how to practice<br>  definitely online: <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/prep_one/test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeboard.com/student/test...</a><br>  ^thats the college board website and they have ACT stuff as well<br>  i would suggest printing out a test because its more realistic practice. That is, sit in a quiet room and time yourself. Make it realistic<br>  Vocabulary is pretty rough (ive done practice @ school) and my vocabulary you mean english. its not terrible because by the time you take it (as a junior or senior) you know a lot more of the words just from everyday use. roots of words are helpful so maybe study roots. Most difficult part for me is the time restriction. i need to practice timing myself and not getting hung up on questions i'll most likely get wrong anyways. its okay to get them wrong. its better to make certain the easy answers are answered. and answered well. good luck but again, 7th grade is like 4 years too early. Theres no way you'll spend over 1,400 days studying for this thing. if you get nervous theres this saltine cracker thing. a half hour before you take the test you should eat 16 saltine crackers to calm your nerves or something like that. idk why but its proven to work. Also guessing-- guessing is okay but definitely eliminate as many answers as you can. good luck!!<br>  btw- the website has so many useful tools on it <br>  <br>  By the way, ACT is more important ;P|`|fga75inTaa	Freshman year is the best year to begin studying for your SAT's. I know a girl who started freshman and scored 2220 on her PSAT. <br>  <br>  I am about to go into my freshman year and my mom is already signing me up for some courses, and my older sister took it and she gave me a lot of hints and tricks.<br>  <br>  The books are teh best way to study for them and the websites will be effective as well. <br>  <br>  She took the SAT last year and she said teh vocabulary portion is challenging. Try getting novels that include the SAT vocab so you enjoy the story and learn the vocab. It also helps with practicing context clues and finding the meaning from words in the sentence. <br>  <br>  The math section is very challenging. The hardest part is basically based on your weakest subject. that is not something I can answer but find out what your weakest subject is and practice really hard so you will be able to pass it.<br>  <br>  Study and stay determined. If you do these things you will do fine. start early because it's the best. Focus on doing the books and all the works, it's all worth it in the end.

Go along to the interview, explain what you have said above, they will help and guide you make the right choices for you, going on your likes and strengths.  These interviews are really very informal, and are there to help you make the right decisions.  When my son had his 6th form interview, nearly 18 months ago I went with him, the lady was very friendly and went through many other courses with him that he didn't even think of prior to the interview and only provisionally booked him onto course as she said many change their mind again when it comes to results day and true to form he did too.  Go along with an open mind, its nothing to be scared of, they are there to help you.    I will say though if English is your strength, take it, if you enjoy it, as it is looked upon very highly by universities.|`|5c6F8ogkaa	i do art, history, history of art and english at college.  i think these are quite good subjects for me to take, seeing as i wonna do art at uni.  but it depends on what u want for ur future. if u do art, then english and history of art will be reli good.   i chose english cos it looks good but i find it reli borin. i would take it to get a high acedemic A level. if u hate it, u can always drop it|`|bJtUNkmhaa	they are higher than sea levels...|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	I would do English, Classics, Sociology and Media Studies  those are alrite subjects. not bad|`|WKiAISZdaa	None of the subjects you have chosen are blacklisted by elite universities.

As for the other subjects I would just go with what you want to do, it is better to a subject that you are going to get good grades in and enjoy than do what your parents say.    P.S I did A-level Media Studies in my first year at sixthform college and I found it pointless I dropped it after that year and picked up English Literature!    Hope that helps!|`|AA11220909	I would do English Literature, Sociology and History as the subjects to follow all the way through to A Level.  And then do something like Classical Civilisation's or Media Studies for the AS Level.
DCQc92Tiaa	ok.... the easiest way is to change the % to a decimal and then a fraction<br>  <br>  so 900% = 9.00 (because 100% =1.00)<br>  9.00 = 9<br>  <br>  150% = 1.5<br>  0.5 = half, so as a mixed number (using whole numbers and fractions) this will be one and a half<br>  <br>  675% = 6.75<br>  the 5 in this number is in the hundredths column, so the fraction's denominator will be 100. therefore the answer is 6 and 75/100<br>  now we have to change this into simpliest form. to do this we need the highest common factor of the two numbers in the fractions, which in this case is 25. divide top and bottom by 25 and you are left with 3/4<br>  therfore 675% = 6 3/4<br>  <br>  0.2% --> the 2 is in the tenths column, so the fraction is 2/10, both these numbers have a factor of 2 so the fraction becomes 1/5<br>  <br>  from this you should be able to work the rest out<br>  hope that helps!

Your school's website might have volunteer opportunities posted by local human services organizations.<br>  And your local library is a great source of info re: volunteer organizations in the community. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's the Capricorn in me, but I would take a practical approach in doing volunteer work or joining clubs.<br>  <br>  If you have the knack for languages, and there is a group devoted to Mandarin Chinese, join it - you'll need to learn it sooner or later. If you're talented in math and science, join for the benefits and friendships you'll get from them. I would not try too hard to second-guess what colleges want to see, because they'll never give you a straight answer.<br>  <br>  And there are lots of lonely seniors in nursing facilities who would appreciate the company of someone young. You would both learn from each other. Some people have no one left in the world, and everyone needs friendship. Imagine how you would feel if every one of your friends had died.

Because you cannot compare Harvard's Business School and UPenn's Wharton at undergraduate level because an equal comparison does not exist.<br>  <br>  If you are comparing the programs between the three schools then it would be interesting to know how selective they are, the percent admitted, the differences in the program, graduation rate, teaching methods and various information about the alumni-- graduate school, professional school, employment, starting salaries etc.... there is much you can write about, if you compare the correct data.

AA10067221	I would choose a controversial topic that is closely connected to your particular age group or generation. Here are a few examples:    __1. -Cyber-bullying: (cyberbullying is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.") Cyber-bullying has grown as a means of threatening, intimidating or harassing others over the past several years. It can take many forms, including posting private or embarrassing photos of someone, developing websites to rate peoples appearance, creating hateful blogs about someone, stealing electronic passwords, or spreading lies.   This controversial issue explores the arguments of censorship, the freedom of speech, the definition of 'willful harm/harassment' and about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying.  http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php    __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: This controversy is regarding the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, beautiful, etc.   In addition to the potential for individual harm, there is an absolutely certain cultural harm related to the mass pursuit and glorification of physical perfection. In her 1992 bestseller, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf describes a $33 billion "thinness industry", a $20 billion "youth industry", and a $300 million "cosmetic surgery industry" and admonishes the commercial forces propelling women towards never ending external improvements. The marketing of plastic surgery to a younger and younger clientele only intensifies a conspiracy that requires women to be evaluated by homogenized perceptions of beauty instead of more integrated and realistic virtues. Why would any of us want to live in a world that requires all of us from 14-year-olds to 50-year-olds  to have Britney Spears' breasts, Reese Whiterspoon's nose and a 4-year-olds' crease free forehead? All women are the losers in this game and we are already in the fifth inning if 20-somethings are scheduling Botox injections and teens are requesting painful surgical procedures as presents.   http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma...    __3. -School Burn-Out: This controversial issue is concerning the amount of school-related activities and requirements teens face now in high school & how that often leads to "school burn-out." Faced with an unlimited amount of choices combined with the pressure of a fast-paced-world, teens are spreading their selves too thin by engaging in a number of commitments. Besides physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion, there are several more pressing consequences of school burn-out.    __4. -To Work or Not To Work: The topic of high school employment is often an overlooked conflict young people face, but nevertheless, a controversial issue. This issue debates why it is either acceptable or not acceptable for teens to have jobs during their high school years. Many teens disregard the benefits of choosing academics over employment and become less focused in their pursuit of an education, while some teens are forced to work in order to provide for themselves and their families.

99b5e8847127b6225db2c2933b5ee44eaa	I know how you're feeling, and I'm currently in high school right now. A couple of months ago, my ex's girlfriend and her friends did similar things to me afterschool, and I felt threatened. Recently, the girlfriend threatened to mess my face up, and I responded to her as calmly as I could by saying that I could easily report her to authorities if she did that to me once more. I think the best possible option isn't to get the police involved because they aren't physically abusing you everyday, but to remain composed and don't let those girls know you're scared of them. Ignore them for a few more days, and if that doesn't work out, confront them and ask them what you've done to provoke them to lash out at you like that. It also helps if you have your friends to talk to - I talked to my English teacher about it, and she made me feel so much better, more so than any of the counselors at my school. :) Keep your head up, stay strong, and remember - all of this **** you're going through is going to make you a wiser individual and prepare you for future experiences.|`|DpzQ2Z1daa	I know how that can be, my freshman year of high school, I got food thrown at me in the cafeteria, gum stuck in my hair on the bus, I was called a weirdo on my bus, and they drew on an expensive seude coat that my g-mom bought me, I eventually left. and I just went back there two days ago. But enough about me. I would suggest ignoring them, because I know that they are probably jealous of you. Dont let it bother you. Just go to the police if your principle wont do nothing, trust me, that works better.|`|4e61a6e4d329230de6805854ded0dbefaa	If your school has a no bullying policy, the school should be handling the situation.  Most schools have a harrasment policy and no bullying policy.  If your teachers aren't helpful, maybe your parents should call the school administration.|`|CLYHmnWyaa	you need to turn on  them they think your quiet take a martial arts class they will say dont do this at school ignore that then throw your books down and whoop a**|`|VJZWilCvaa	I've had worse during 4th grade where EVERYONE hated me.<br>  Just sit next to the teacher or something.. get some friends to help you out with it. I'm not someone who does this because I'm very quiet and only talk when people ask me something.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I think that you and your parents should go to the school together and talk to the principal and demand that something be done. If this doesn't work, have your parents go to the media and explain to them how this is happening and that the school won't do anything about it.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	Wow. I would publicize the school's name. And I'd call the police. I remember when someone went on YouTube to publicized the name and store phone number of a game store manager who'd ignored the waiting list for a hot new gaming device and just sold them to whoever had walked in. <br>  <br>  It sparked an avalanche of phone calls and threats of boycotts. Not that you can boycott schools. But you MAY be able to shame yours into doing the right thing, which is making sure you are in a safe environment.<br>  <br>  Tell the principal yourself. And make sure he or she knows you've told the teachers. Assault and battery are the occasion of both civil lawsuits and police action. Don't be afraid of that. THE BULLIES, and their parents, should be afraid of that. It's up to the principal to face this and deal with it. That's what they get paid for.<br>  <br>  And suits against schools that have knowingly permitted bullying have been successful in some states. <br>  <br>  Teasing and exclusion and gossip are bad enough, but when you've been threatened with physical harm, an adult has to step in and stop it.

Here are some tips to help you out. <br>  Pay attention in class, sit away from people that distract you and put away stuff that distracts you. <br>  Try repeating silently (in your mind) most of what the teacher says about how to do problems. That's like taking notes in your mind. <br>  When the teacher is talking, you might try not holding a pencil -- if you are tempted to draw on your page, and not pay attention. <br>  Or, you could try taking notes of what the teacher says about how to understand and to do problems. Writing it down may help or force you to pay attention and to try to "get it." Don't just write everything down without even understanding what it means and why. <br>  If you really have to be distracted, do so after you thoroughly understand the topic your teacher is currently teaching. <br>  Even if you did not actually take notes, still try to write down the key points somewhere on a piece of paper, and file it somewhere after each math lesson. (This works great for other subjects like science and literature topics too!) <br>  Also, try to write down the different sample problems from that topic, as well as the different solutions needed to solve it -- as part of your classwork or homework. <br>  If a problem can have more than one way of being solved, write down all the ways. This is because most math problems have an easy way and a hard way to solve, and the easy way may be a different method each time. The easy way is good for checking your solutions, when the teacher requires all of the steps. <br>  Your own notes can be much more effective than school notes or reference books, since you have written them yourself and understand them.

FXP2pnlJaa	Wow, I had wanted to be a doctor has a kid, but changed my mind halfway through high school, and now I'm a graphic design major. :)<br>  <br>  Well, I won't tell you which to choose, but I can tell you some stuff I've had to do in school - though I'm only in my second semester as of now.<br>  There are a lot of art pre-reqs that you have to take, like drawing, 2D design, photography, and so on before you do really get into the real graphic design stuff with photoshop/illustrator. But believe me, when you DO take a class that deals with real graphic design, it's absolutely amazing. You can basically design what you want at your heart's desire. The deadlines are close, though. So, you can't plan on having very much time for yourself. But the people you meet in class are really cool. Art kids are the bomb. :)<br>  <br>  Medicine is very interesting, I will agree. But you have even less time to yourself. The reason why I turned it down, is because I'm a very friends and family-oriented person. I want as much time as possible to be able to spend time with them, and you don't get very much by going to med school. However, the money is great, and you're always helping people out. That's why I wanted to go into medicine in the first place, was so I could help those that needed it, and also because I was very very interested in the human body - and still am.|`|Nj36OUPFaa	i don't think you should be asking people on here to help you choose your life long career.|`|jCgnnWmuaa	Why don't you integrate them both and find a vocation that incorporates both subjects?

ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	First make a speech to your mom or dad. Then make a speech to both of them. Then try it on 4 people. You'll work your way up to larger audiences and the more times you speak in front of a crowd, the less nervous you will be. It's that easy.|`|qu0yW58Iaa	It is all about confidence.

OVzIN9Yraa	Much different. <br>  I saw high school life as more laid back, and easy-going (at most). Teachers care about you, your marks, your attendance, and your learning. They are there to help you and want you to succeed.<br>  In University its more independent, and challenging compared to high school. Large class sizes, heavier work load. I have many U of T friends in Life Sci who literally have no lives but study, study, study lol. You'll meet people who have the same goals as you, more mature people than many of the ones in high school.<br>  If your living off-campus expect a much different life!! (ie parties..)<br>  Good luck! Don't fall back in school work or else you'll be spending lots of nights cramming!|`|48I58Awsaa	Most students go NUTS when being away from home,<br>  especially in their freshman year.<br>  Here are the list of differences:<br>  <br>  - No parents (duh) around to keep you in check<br>  - Nevertheless, you have Residence Assistants (short RA) they'll keep an eye on you.<br>  - Loud music<br>  - Possibly drugs<br>  - Cigarettes<br>  - Sex<br>  (of course all those only apply if you were a good kid through high school)<br>  - Taking care of your own finances<br>  <br>  etc.<br>  <br>  The majority of students will calm down after their first year<br>  not just because their grades will go down<br>  but actually realizing how dumb this all is (the drugs & drinking, minus the sex and taking care of your money).<br>  <br>  Take care and be safe!!<br>  :)

AA11604732	Are you in the US?  If so, then you can't major in pediatrics at any college.<br>  <br>  You first have to get a BS (where you could also minor in theatre).  Then you need to go to medical school for four years to get an MD or a DO.  Then you need to spend a year as a medical intern.  Finally, you enter a residency program for pediatrics -- which takes three to five years.  After that, you take an exam to become a board certified pediatrician.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	You should go to <a href="http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/adv_typeofschool.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...</a> and take that test.

I mean, I'm not saying they can't punish you for doing that, but my god...10 days and tribunal? are they out of their minds? I really really feel bad for you and I hope you'll solve this somehow, maybe someone who's lived here forever knows how to deal with this!<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm a senior too.|`|FXP2pnlJaa	If you didn't physically go into the computer/server yourself and take down the firewall, I would have to agree that it is just misuse, and not trespass, and that your suspension is absolutely beyond what should have been given to you.<br>  <br>  At this point, I would definitely get the news involved, and see if you can talk to the school board at all about this. If the school board doesn't say anything, then go to the authorities and see what they can do, because that is absolutely not fair.<br>  <br>  I really hope things work out for you, and you can graduate like the rest of us '09ers!
zvzjZwFnaa	If you instructed other students in anyway(even if they asked and you responded) how to download it then you are technically at fault for the specific people that did it.  It doesn't matter (in their eyes) that you aren't responsible for what they did with the proxy, you put the proverbial "gun" in their hand and told them how to use it. if you didn't tell anyone how to use the proxy then tell them to ask the other people where they learned about it.  the best you can do is take responsibility and let them know that you want to take your share of responsibility for stupid web-browsing that could have waited until you got home -- BUT THAT'S ALL.|`|BIwZ7klfaa	why do you think it has to be fair?

It's a question calling for knowledge, not membership in or belief in a religion. <br>  <br>  That being said, she should not hold you responsible for not acquiring knowledge she never said you would need for the test. That was a sloppily-written test. <br>  <br>  The issue here is incompetence. I wouldn't exactly tell her *that* to her face, but I would broach the subject with her. You have a valid argument for not being penalized. Though I would have written in the test itself that I had never read the Bible and had not been told it was required for the exam, just to make her think before she graded. She can't test you on stuff she never taught.<br>  <br>  I hate when that happens. Lazy professors.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	Apparently there were two bible stories represented in the book and you just didn't read carefully enough. I do think that the teacher should have gone over this if the question was going to be on the test. I do not think that it is a big Christian conspiracy :)|`|hdOqvaYoaa	Hey, isnt that sue-able?
AA10025466	You can apply for freshman admission after high school graduation given that you do not attend a community college (once you attend a CC, you will need to complete all the requirements and apply as a junior transfer).<br>  <br>  You can make plans to participate in "gap year" programs or long-term community service commitments after high school graduation and discuss your experience in your college application.<br>  <br>  All AP courses are created equal, so you should take whichever you expect to do well in.  While you are not required to take AP courses, having rigorous course schedule during high school makes you more competitive.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you apply in Fall 2010 and see what happens.  You can always make backup plans if things don't pan out.  Don't exclude yourself just because you don't think you qualify; let the admissions office make that decision.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	What do you mean by not meeting their requirements?  If you'll meet them by the time you graduate, you can go ahead and apply now - that's what most people do.  They might require four years of English, and as long as you'd have them before you started, you're fine, even if you're taking the last year now.  But yes, you could always start a year later.  You can always start at community college and transfer afterwards.

Who would be deprived of privileges in a society under a communist ideology?  The rich (persons or corporations).  By what means is the public opinion created or sustained?  By the media.  (We call it press, either written or spoken or viewed and spoken).  So, there you are.  Is exactly what the communist regimes also do.  They just take a hold of the media, create or invent public opinion and there you are.  Russians used to hate us.  We used to hate Russians.  So. . . its life, friend.  Communist ideology government were not better or worse than our capitalist ideology government.  Which is best?  Well, there are opinions.  Adian.|`|YMI6Yl18aa	The fear of communism is a deep rooted fear instilled a log time ago culminating in the Cold War. For many years, America and Russia were at odds, in what was ultimately a battle between capitalism and communism. It's understandable that americans will still fear communism especially as they probably now associate it with the Cold War and especially Stalin. <br>  <br>  I also don't think it's a very American ideal, to put all of your hard-earned money into the hands of the government, to control and distribute. Idealistic though it may be theoretically, communism in practice is a flawed and foolish notion. Americans are very independant and i think they are also afraid of placing that kind of misplaced trust in anyone, let alone the Government. <br>  <br>  Remember that this is a long seated idea in America, and often a fear that Americans have grown up with. The fear of Communism was massive only a short while ago, and spread a lot of fear through the western capitalist countries. Especially America, the front line of the capitalist attack.

5zhAdR1raa	Is this written correctly? I ask because 2^3 = 8 and writing it that way is kind of strange.    Anyway, usually the best thing to try is to factor - so, the denominator in the first term and the numerator in the second term are good candidates:    x^2 - 2x = x(x-2)    x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x+2)(x+2)    so, looking at the second term only, you have:    (x+2)^2/((x+2)^3) = 1/(x+2)    the first term is:    (x^3 + 8)/(x(x-2))    the entire expression is now:     (x^3 + 8)/(x(x-2)) * 1/(x+2) = (x^3+8)/(x(x-2)(x+2))

This is obviously important in a restaurant environment, but it's important at home too, so now I am more careful about my food preparation. Another thing I have learned is how to react quickly in stressful situations and to better deal with a large variety of people, including customers and employees. I think even if you are not a manager at a restaurant it will still give you good life experience to just work there because you have to be able to get along with people.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Obviously one of the things that you have learned is going on line to YA to cheat on your essay since you are supposed to write about what YOU have learned not what WE have learned.<br>  <br>  PS I'm sure this is one of the answers that won't "please" you!

mm7ABdlXaa	A solution is made up of a solvent and a solute.  The solute dissolves in the solvent.  An easy example can be something like Kool-Aid.  The water is the solvent and the Kool-Aid powder is the solute.  It mixes together to form a solution.  Solutions generally can not be separated without serious effort.  A mixture is a combination of things that will separate.  Some examples include vinegar and oil salad dressing.  If you shake it up - it looks like a solution.  Let it sit, and it will separate back to oil and vinegar.  The salad itself is a mixture of lettuce, carrots, celery, cucumbers, tomatos... whatever... they can be separated.

72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	do you want a career in photography or something related to photography?  do you do anything in your spare time related to photography?  why did you choose this course?  what sparked your interest in photography in the first place?  what do you particularly find interesting about photography?  do you have a hobby which is related to photography?  did you do any evening classes related to photography?  when you take a photo, does it symbolises or reminds you of anything special?    do you mess around using photo imaging software?  do you take photos often?  did you do an art module in photography in school?  do you research cameras and their features?  do you get really annoyed when you don't get things just right?  do you work for a photoshop in your spare time?  do you have a whole computer folder of photos you have messed around with or used for your art project you could call as your portfolio?  do you take interest in films, lighting, special effects?  do you take interest in imagery?    hope this helps|`|6qsocyK3aa	It kind of already tell you what to write! ;)    Why are you choosing this course? Well, why are you? Because you enjoy it, because you want to further your experience in it, because you want the chance to look at the subject from a new angle, what?    What are your career aspirations? Well I guess they involve photography but in what way? Do you want to be a wedding photographer? A nature photographer? How will this course get you there?    Non-examined subjects? I think this maybe means you have to talk any any subjects you're interested in but that are not graded or examined. Maybe someone else will be able to help you out with this better than I can.    If you're a mature student, you probably have some sort of relevent experience or interest in Photography because if not why would you even consider taking it? Detail the experience, how it helped, what you took from it, etc.    You might also want to put in how you became interested in photography and why and any other subjects you're passionate about that could help you are relate in somewhere. Like if you're interested in art, maybe you could talk about how you'd want to explore how photography IS an art and how you could combine the two.    Good luck!|`|dVxdDYrdaa	send a letter that shows your passion for photography|`|cb8c071977c4188a0bf7c6db3e3a39bfaa	its your personal statement, therefore, write about your personal experiences, and what your interests are. Make sure you include why you want to go into photography, and why you like it. Talk about your hobbies and other interests, and make sure you put across to them how you could be a benifit to them. have you done any work experience? What personal qualities do you possess? Just be as original and creative,(BE YOURSELF), and you shall get through it well. gd luck!

Make a plan of what YOU hope to do and why and sit her down to discuss it.  She may continue to argue about it, but stand firm.  You might want to enlist the aid of an adult that she respects, to help you convince her.  The sooner the better, or you'll end up with as many regrets as she seems to have.  Good luck!

Starebbe poi all'alunno approfondire  quale religione gli interessa. La scuola dovrebbe fornire solo una base per poter scegliere.|`|6ZmxHualaa	Si perchè o è un'ora sprecata o i prof sono così "pesanti" ke diventa catechismo...<br>  No se si insegna storia delle religioni e si è aperti anche al confronto perchè può essere un modo per crescere.<br>  Purtpoppo però la religione cattolica si è impadronita dell'Italia (altro che stato laico)...<br>  :-)|`|EBvIfvEwaa	Dunque, come materia sarebbe molto interessante, soprattutto se si studiassero le religioni del mondo, e non ci si limitasse alla religione cattolica.<br>  Avrebbe senso se guardiamo al fatto che, effettivamente, la religione è alla base della nostra cultura ed è degna di essere studiata. Non ha senso usare l'ora di religione per non fare niente (come succede troppo spesso), ma non ha neanche senso usarla come materia scolastica se la religione cattolica puoi impararla anche a catechismo.<br>  Io, per come è adesso l'insegnamento della religione nelle scuole primarie e secondarie, toglierei la materia|`|Nf9uXDGpaa	no per tanti motivi. primo fra tutti ma non meno importante è che io sono un'insegnante di religione!!!!!!!!<br>  siccome chi non ne è dentro non vede quanto sia importante questo insegnamento lo spiegherò:<br>  innanzitutto c'è collaborazione e approfondimento di altre materie. si approfondiscono  e focalizzano molti valori condivisi e si conosce la cultura che per tantissimi anni, secoli, è stata propria del nostro paese. ricordo che è cultura e non catechismo, quindi non richiede un adesione di fede, possono partecipare tutti anche gente di altre religioni.|`|Ob7rZITNaa	no xkè l'italia è un paese cattolico, quindi con tutto il rispetto ke posso provare verso le altre religioni non credo ke sia lecito togliere religione, per il semplice fatto ke se vengono in italia devono accettare l'insegnamento della religione.beh penso ke abbiate capito...|`|RYZzKbQGaa	Ci sono dei pro e dei contro...<br>  Non lo toglierei perchè l'italia è un paese cattolico, anche se accoglie tantissime persone con una religione diversa dalla nostra, che rispettiamo come la nostra deve essere rispettata. Spesso, però, religione (nelle scuole che conosco) è un'ora di svago, dove tutti si fanno i fatti loro. Capita che venga considerata un'ora di riposo. Per questo fatto, se deve essere vista tale, la toglierei, ma non credo che in tutte le scuole sia così. <br>  In ogni caso non è considerata un vero e proprio insegnamento, visto che c'è libera scelta nelle scuole superiori di scegliere una materia alternativa, quindi non frequentare questa lezione. Io a Dio ci credo, ma nel mio modo, non sono quindi condizionatissima dalla Chiesa...nonostante le scelte di ogni persona, penso che sia un bene conoscere la religione ufficiale del paese in cui viviamo, seppur talvolta non è quella in cui crediamo.<br>  baciOxx|`|S2PzSYqdaa	No. Perchè la religione del'Italia è la religione cristiana e non vedo perchè si dovrebbe togliere.|`|Yl7HNQFvaa	Il nostro stato è laico<br>  La scuola è pubblica<br>  ma vabbè.....<br>  mi basterebbe che gli insegnanti di religione da immettere in ruolo non fossero scelti dal Vescovo..visto che li paga lo Stato!!!! (cioè noi)|`|ZEeopdcBaa	Io la toglierei perchè c'è già il catechismo, ma visto che non accadrà mai mi piacerebbe che in tutte le scuole venissero insegnate tutti i punti di vista DELLE RELIGIONI. non solo la nostra!<br>  In alcune scuole accade ma nella mia ad esempio no. si parlava solamente di cristianesimo ma mai ad esempio di ebraismo o induismo..|`|ap9gfhL2aa	si perchè lo insegnano già al catechismo|`|axILmcF2aa	Quando andavo io a scuola, l'ora di religione era sempre un'ora di svago. ognuno faceva quello che voleva. è stato così per le medie e le superiori.

La religione è un'altra cosa.|`|xjiw66HHaa	No, ma invece di "insegnamento religione cattolica", insegnerei storia delle religioni e storia della filosofia, con livelli di approfondimento diversi ma in tutte le scuole.<br>  Tutti avrebbero maggiore possibilita' di vivere in modo consapevole la loro dimensione spirituale , senza la quale l'uomo è veramente poca cosa.|`|jo9rv2CJaa	no xk non si tratta di lezioni di cristianesimo, ma di ore che insegnano la storia delle varie religioni nel mondo, cristiana, mussulmana, buddista, ebraica. si trattano anche argomenti umanistici e si parla di associazioni come ONU, UNICEF e AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL.<br>  inoltre i ragazzi di religione diversa i cui genitori ritengono inopportuna questa lezione hanno la possobilità di uscire dalla scuola per non essere obbligati a frequentarla.<br>  perciò io direi che l'ora di religione è più che legittima; una cosa che invece toglierei dalle classi è il crocifisso, poichè ritengo che le scuole pubbliche debbano essere dello stato e cioè laiche. con questo non voglio fare l'ateista (non atea ma "ateista" è diverso) ma solo ribadire quella che secondo me è l'importanza di scindere la nazione cristiana dalla laicità imparziale che deve mantenere uno stato.<br>  buona serata, littlea, e un bacio*|`|6zwTE1psaa	sì<br>  <br>  molto meglio: storia delle religioni, sano confronto tra cristianesimo, protestantesimo, buddismo ecc|`|0f87cd2cf691c8a24f80d33a4032960caa	Si.

Penso inoltre che una cultura di tolleranza e di pacifica convivenza si costruisca con basi più solide se c'è una conoscenza reciproca piuttosto che un'indifferenza degli uni verso gli altri o peggio un divieto di affrontare argomenti religiosi per paura di ferire qualcuno.|`|8OWEczGZaa	Io non ho fatto religione, in segno di protesta, credo, da parte dei miei genitori perchè ritenevano ingiusto che si insegnasse la religione cattolica e non le altre.<br>  Effettivamente la scuola non è il luogo per parlare delle cose di Dio, se uno è interessato a saperle ci sono altri luoghi come le chiese.<br>  Eppure ormai per i giovani a scuola si impara a fare lo spinello, a imbrogliare e ha superare gli ostacoli con la furbizia, piangendo dalla mamma e non con il serio studio e impegno.<br>  La chiese invece per i giovani sono solo degli "oratori",mi fa ridere il nome che gli danno perchè chi va lì per pregare?<br>  L'oratorio per la maggior parte dei giovani è il posto dove si va a giocare a calcio, o sbaglio?<br>  <br>  Quindi la chiesa non insegna la parola di Dio (semmai cerca di insegnare il catechismo cattolico) a questo punto almeno che rimanga la religione.<br>  Tutto questo per dirti che non sono daccordo, ma se ci riesco vorrei diventare insegnante di religione, per raccontare ai ragazzi, che ne hanno un gran bisogno, quello che è scritto nella bibbia.<br>  Mi sono informato e "basta" essere iscritti a un corso di teologia, anche se poi nella scuola (dove lavoro come insegnante di informatica) mi hanno detto che le persone vengono scelte dalla diocesi e quindi non ho speranza pare!!!<br>  Ma io ci provo e se Dio vuole, mi prodigherò per Lui anche in questo servizio e se no andrò dove Egli vorrà, c'è tanto da fare per diffondere la Sua parola.<br>  <br>  Dio ti benedica!|`|Gx20t6zkaa	Si, come è fatto adesso, no se cambiasse.<br>  <br>  L'insegnamento dovrebbe essere storia delle religioni , perchè oltre ad essere in uno stato laico (la religione cristiana non è più la religione di stato da parecchio tempo), stiamo andando sempre più verso un epoca di multiculturalità, in cui serve sapere , conoscere ciò che tutte le religioni hanno in se, questo per togliere ogni ignoranza e pregiudizio verso le persone di religione diversa, e per acquisire un apertura mentale e spirituale che porta al confronto costruttivo e non alla critica pregiudizievole.<br>  <br>  Io per la scuola che ho fatto, ho fatto storia delle religioni , e credimi ci sono cose che uno deve sapere anche e soprattutto quando ha contatti con l'estero, o quando in casa propria incontra uno straniero o un extra comunitario.<br>  Oppure un Italiano di religione diversa da quella cattolica come lo sono io.<br>  <br>  Inoltre tutti i bambini vanno a catechismo, perciò perchè caricarli due volte delle stesse nozioni?|`|W0uy58M2aa	NO E PER QUALE MOTIVO?|`|a4Hl7Alraa	Si,<br>  le religioni andrebbero abbracciate,<br>  non inculcate per paura di perdere fedeli.<br>  Essere cattolici cristiani o musulmani dovrebbe essere una scelta adulta e consapevole, non qualcosa in cui ci è stato insegnato a credere.<br>  In questo modo le religioni perdono di qualsiasi credibilità.<br>  O si insegnano tutte o nessuna.|`|eaX3lFqyaa	No. I cattolici parlano di vari argomenti(che poi non sono sempre religione, molte volte attualità, ad esempio l'ultima volta si parlava delle nuove scoperte sulle staminali). Gli altri possono tranquillamente sciegliere se astenersi(e in tal caso ci sarebbero tanti vantaggi) o partecipare alla discussione o usare l'ora come svago. Se gli studenti(i diretti interessati)sono tutti contenti non vedo perchè toglierla.|`|hfPokCcvaa	si la vedo inutile come insegnamento...<br>  se ho voglia io personalmente mi informero e studiero tale materia....|`|zlvzU7TVaa	subito..è solo catechismo..<br>  ..io metterei qualche ora in più di storia e filosofia

c11cd2f96c51c06f28d946d941e54646aa	Just wanted to add that The Odyssey shows that one must have wits in addition to brawn in order to conquer monsters.  That is one of the themes that sets The Odyssey apart from The Iliad: The Iliad is about pure physical strength, such as that of Achilles, and how he conquered based on his athleticism alone.  The Odyssey's central character is Odysseus, who is introduced as a man of "twists and turns," meaning he's extremely cunning, and he had to use his wits in order to defeat monsters (who gave him riddles to solve, trapped him, etc).  The dominant characters in LOTR, such as Gandalf and Aragorn, are wise and are fast thinkers, which make them great warriors.  One of the characters even says at one point that the Urukai will be more difficult to defeat than Orks (sp?) because they are cunning as well as strong.  The Hobbits are not brawny beings, but they managed to complete a difficult mission largely because they used their brains.<br>  <br>  So...I guess both stories might be trying to say that physical strength and size aren't everything.|`|101408e301d215ca0104288dc13c3614aa	1.) both are long journeys into far lands<br>  2.) both are attempting to deal with mythology (myth vs. myth wanna-be)<br>  3.) both deal with fantasy creatures<br>  4.) both deal with characters who develope throughout the story<br>  5.) both classics<br>  6.) both stress loyalty (to one's gods and wife vs. to ones friends)|`|4c9c532dcf0596f66a9afd48a5b913f5aa	There's a journey in both stories.

U CUD HAVE JUST HAD A GOOGLE SEARCH ND TONS OF WEBSITES WUD HAVE POPPED UP FOR U....WELL, HELPING U....:    Disadvantages of Working from Home    (1) Lonelyness - if you are a people person like me, one thing you will probably miss most when you make the transition from full time work to working from home is contact with other people. At first I missed having people to talk to all the time and going for coffee and a chat each day with my coworkers. If you are working alone from home you just need to be sure to have some contact with others. You could do this by meeting people for a quick lunch, going to the gym during the day, arranging to meet friends more often in the evening, partnering with other people for certain parts of your business or joining a club.    No Perks or Benefits - you may be used to having benefits such as medical insurance, bonuses, pension contributions and a car allowance. When you start working for yourself full time you will lose the majority of these benefits. For this reason you need to make sure that you are able to earn enough money to cover your existing salary and benefits if you need to.    (3) Never ending Workload and responsibility - as the owner of your own work from home business it may sometimes seem like the work is never ending. It is much easier for your working day to flow over into the evening and you could find yourself working much longer hours, especially in the beginning when you are struggling to make enough money. If something isn't working or if a crisis arises then you have the responsibility for fixing the problem.    Advantages of Working from Home    (1) Freedom - freedom is one of the biggest advantages of working for yourself. You can work the hours that you want to work rather than being in an office 9 till 5 every day. If you are not a morning person you can always have a long lie each day and start work a little later. If you need to go to an appointment in the middle of the day you don't need to ask the boss. If you want to spend time with the kids when they get home from school you can do this. If it is nice weather outside you can go out and sit in the garden for a while or even do some work outside... and so the list goes on!    (2) Earning Potential - as an employee you are usually constrained by grades and salary brackets. Your pay rises are normally decided by your boss and may be subject to budgets and sometimes company cutbacks. As the owner of your own business you have a huge potential to make a lot more money than you did as an employee and you can choose to pay yourself as much of this as you desire.    (3) Job satisfaction - when you are your own boss you can decide what work to do yourself and what to outsource. For example, if you don't enjoy doing the financial side of things you can outsource this. You can keep the work that you enjoy most for yourself and pay others to do the work that you enjoy the least. If you are an employee you won't always be able to do this.|`|NXwzuv3Paa	Advantages:  do your work(housework) when you want to  sleep when you want to  go where you want to    Disadvantages:  no money of your own  no social network  get tired of being lonely|`|LzWfHMZhaa	Thanks for the   |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|b608bf48d04dd8ad5722966584254514aa	advantages>>>   be your own boss  make your own hours  more family time    disadvantages>>>  always at home means no away time for you.  family time could interfere with job or visa versa.  have to make sure you pay in your own taxes and social security..this means extra paper work for you.    cheers  mystic|`|OapXbjbSaa	Disadvantages of Working from Home  1 Lonelyness  2 No Perks or Benefits  3 Never ending Workload and responsibility      Advantages of Working from Home  1 freedom is one of the biggest advantages of working for yourself  2 Earning Potential  3 Job satisfaction|`|l6mB3Hnsaa	List three advantages and three disadvantages for people who work NOT at home?

FNvv74UQaa	Flat 303 Lucky Mansions  856 Cheung Sha Wan Road  Cheung Sha Wan  Kowloon    30 January 2009    The Administrative Officer  Exhibition Services  Exhibitions International  33 Kadoorie Avenue  Kowloon    Dear Sir/Madam    I attended your exhibition Sound Systems 2009 at the Fortune Hotel from 21 - 23 January and found it informative and interesting. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the event was spoiled by a number of organisational problems. I explain each of the problems below.    Firstly, I had difficulty in registering to attend the event. You set up an on-line registration facility, but I found the facility totally unworkable. Even after spending several wasted hours trying to register in this way, the computer would not accept my application. I eventually succeeded in registering by faxing you.    Secondly, the exhibition was held at one of Hong Kong's most prestigious hotels, but frankly the venue was better suited to a medium-sized business conference than to a large exhibition open by registration to the public. The lack of space led to serious overcrowding in the venue, particularly at peak visiting times (i.e. lunch times and early evening). On one or two occasions I was also seriously concerned about the physical safety of attendees.    The final point I want to make concerns product information. It is very enjoyable to see and test a range of excellent sound systems, but it is also important to be able to take away leaflets on interesting products, so that more research can be done before deciding which system to buy. However, by the time I attended the exhibition all the leaflets had been taken.    Could I please ask you to look into these matters - not only on my behalf but also on behalf of other attendees, and in fact on behalf of your company, too.    I look forward to hearing from you.    Yours faithfully    Michael Leung    Michael Leung|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Write my true complaint:  breaded clam strips were two-for-one, that price was on the shelf but I was charged for two packages because the sale started the next day (how was I to know that?).  I like shopping at the store and enjoy their quality, variety and sales, but their pricing policy is a constant torment.  There may not even be a price on something I want to buy in the produce department.  In that case, I stop somewhere else on the way home.  They need to be more attentive to their shelf prices.    Start by telling them how much I enjoy shopping at their store and always look through their sales flier in the newspaper.

b1gBoizMaa	Salut Kty,<br>  <br>  Je crois que les hommes ont plus de mal à supporter la solitude que les femmes (évidemment, pas tous les hommes et pas toutes les femmes...). Mais ne le dis pas à un homme car il te dira le contraire et se vexera.<br>  Pourquoi ? <br>  Grande question... Est-ce que c'est parce M?mam les a habitués à être servis à la maison ? Je n'ai pas la réponse.<br>  Ce que je sais, c'est que s'il s'avère que Pixel est un gar?on, je ferai tout mon possible pour qu'il participe aux activités de la maison, autant que si c'était une petite fille. Ce n'est pas le sexe qui détermine la participation à la communauté. Les petites filles ne naissent pas plus avec des chromosomes "vaisselle", "faire le lit, la bouffe", que les petits gar?ons. Y'a rien de génétique là-dedans !

LcYeN6m5aa	I was a nuke and a master at arms - it all depnds on the college you go to.     One college gave me NO credit for my nuke training, another gave me 2years for it all.....    Some universities give a PLA or Prior Learning Assessment and give a LOT of credit for it all.      HOWEVER - having your electives is a GOOD thing - but my advice - go shop around some more - if he's working on becoming an RN or an MD - be willing to move to get the credit and shorten your education costs.      There is a difference between your military TRAINING and college EDUCATION.....in our training we learnd HOW things are done but didn't focus so much on theories or the state of the art of the field....in college education you focus more on the theories and prepare to make a contribution to the realm of knowledge of academia.    I only got elective credit because I'm becoming a dr. of psychology in a completely different field....but all my math and such were wiped out from my nuke training....I've gotten to focus HEAVILY On my major however.....    Check around....not all universites are the same....keep looking till you find the deal you want or find the best deal.....

xfqHi1tRaa	There is no cure for homesickness.<br>  <br>  First, go to your school nurse and get treated for the sinus infection. THAT you can do something about. And, being ill tends to make you more homesick.<br>  <br>  Second, get some food. You will not get better without eating. FORCE yourself if needed.<br>  <br>  Now, to mitigate your homesickness, the trick is that your HEART AND MIND must be where you are as well as your body. That won't happen if you are spending a lot of time communicating with your family and friends back home. You need to concentrate on making friends and activities where you are now. Join clubs, play music, do sports. Anything that keeps you occupied. As to your exams, instead of trying to study on your own, get a group together. Chances are you're not the only person feeling homesick! <br>  <br>  So  -- get treated for your illness, EAT, and begin turning your attention to where you ARE, not where you WERE.|`|1FsjbbNHaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much. Try calling your family at home and just have some nice, long conversations with them that don't heavily involve school.

Maybe you could also do some fun activities while you're at school and that will help get your mind off of things. I hope you feel better soon! :)

It is the beginning of optional education in Britain. <br>  <br>  This period is called Sixth Form, otherwise known as Year 12 and Year 13 (which i believe is possibly Grade 13 and 14 in america). It's called that because a few decades ago, the school system was labelled first form, second form and so forth up to sixth form and seventh form (for the seven years of education from 11yrs old). Now though, that has all changed but we still use sixth form to cover those last two years - Lower sixth and Upper sixth. In america i think this is when you would be in college. <br>  <br>  The school year begins in september. We sometimes have module exams in january in certain subjects, however our main exams begin in May through to June. These dates are subjective however a safe bet would be late May, or anytime in June really. Looking up A-level exam dates on the internet will give you further information in terms of specific dates.

There are many LDS people who tend to believe that God used evolution and natural selection in the creation process.  It's interesting to compare the account in Genesis to the order proposed by many scientists (light, then water life, then plant life, mamals, man).  It's the same order.  This postition is refered to as "concordism".  <br>  <br>  BYU often approaches evolution from this perspective.

zCHnMeXbaa	Steinbeck lived during the Great Depression years, a time in which many people were at or below the poverty line. Many of those people became non-trustful of any individual new to town, or those that threaten their community social standards.  People, in many cases, imagined threats that did not exist.  Also, many people became extremely possessive of what little they had.  Consider the characters since they are basically composites of Steinbeck. <br>  <br>  Carlson: has little sympathy for anything; he killed Candy's pet.<br>  Crooks:  increasing separated from the others due to increased discrimination brought about by the hard lives of others.<br>  Curly: his wife has become his most important "possession."  He will do anything to protect that possession.  His wife is now symbolic of his need to be a man and protect what is his from all others. <br>  Lennie, George, and Candy have hit bottom--loss of self and self esteem.  All they have left are their "dreams of better life."  Yet, they are only dreams since none of them has the resources to better themselves, none of the three are not really a part of the community. They are living their dreams on the fringes.

WMXPzMQJaa	NO NO NO NO NO Do not post your essay on the internet your teacher will think you plagiarized!|`|7wAdC1Enaa	Just write whats different and whats simular between the two|`|aoOhcBnAaa	I would Highly recommend a rewrite of this essay.  It is unwise to use the first or second person (i.e "you" and "I") unless in rhetoric.  Also you may want to write your introductory and concluding paragraphs in the funnel style (starting with a broad example, question, or quote and narrowing it down in the intro, and then returning to that idea at the end).  You essay also lacks a clear thesis statement .  I would recommend a thesis.  I would recommend writing it in the authors purpose format.  The body of the article seems pretty good though, however after you add a thesis you may want to add how each piece of evidence relates to the thesis.  If you make the those changes I am sure you will have a great essay and impress your teacher.

mSVXV2gbaa	The narrator acts as a go-between for his friend Nick Solchuk, a geophysicist doing research in England, and Nick's father, a farmer in Three Bear Hills, Alberta. Although Nick solves problems related to the earth's curvature and although his room overlooking the Thames gives him a sense of distance and space, he misses the openness of the Canadian prairies.  In contrast to his son's modern scientific outlook, Mr. Solchuk believes in the fundamental flatness of the earth: "... the shape of the world he lived in had been forever fixed for him by some medieval priest in the small Ukrainian village".  The narrator-mediator between these two world-views leaves England's "nature humanized" for Canada's expanses.<br>  This narrative vanishing point, an almost meeting between two theories of the earth's shape, prepares for the interchange with Mr. Solchuk and the broken globe. As a schoolboy, Nick had received the globe, and when he tried to show his father how the earth moves, the traditionalist smashed the globe. A confirmed empiricist, Mr. Solchuk points out the prairie's earlier features at the end of the story to the narrator.<br>  Geometrically, the squashed globe resembles an ellipse whose foci are Europe and the Canadian West, history and geography, Kreisel's past and present.

You have to write properly in order to be taken seriously at the collegiate level. Spell check is not enough. With that being said, colleges have different requirements for majors in education. If you plan on teaching in NY State, check the Board of Education website and search specific areas of concentration. For example, special education, guidance counseling and specific subject areas have requirements that differ from one another although they are under the umbrella of education. Find a college that offers an education major. Then in you sophomore or junior year, begin looking towards graduate school for certifications and licensing requirements. Becoming a teacher is not as easy as it once was.  <br>  Good luck.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	You need a BA or BS in elementary education.  If your college does not have an elementary education degree option you need to major in interdisciplinary studies and work to get your certification in teaching.

For the exact requirements do a google or yahoo search for your state department of education and you should be able to find the requirements for your state.|`|cd34020a65284302293e6ddbd581f262aa	Yes,you neeed a BA instead of an AS since an AS is only a 2 year degree and a BA is a 4 year degree.I would go ahead and get your basics out of the way.Whatever classes you transfer,make sure they are able to transfer,because some class won't transfer.I would talk to admission or advisor/counselor on whichever school you plan on going to.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|43035f3cb2276e8aed71758a17072446aa	hey..well in England u need a BA in teaching?

lQIKWXDuaa	No dont give up on your dream. Apply to schools in  California and apply for financial aid.  Wait and see what each university has to offer you. You can also go to your state's school. The one that is the furthest from your parent's house. Also, apply to school within your state just in case you cant afford to pay for the schools in California. Start looking for scholarships. Grab your self a book with a list of the scholarships. You can find that book at your local library or at a book store. Apply to as many scholarships as you can. Millions of dollar get wasted each year because no one apply for those scholarships. Avoid fastweb, since millions of people will see those scholarships and apply for them. Good Luck to you.

yGOmMQP7aa	Filling out the paperwork to receive your AA is not what makes you ineligible for federal aid if you have already earned all your credits.  What makes people ineligible for aid is having attempted to many hours for the degree they are trying to receive.  If you are at a junior college, they usually cut your aid at 90 credits.  At a 4 year school they cut you off at about 180 credits.  I would submit your paperwork to get your AA and then get into a BS nursing program at a 4 year university.  Skip the 2 year RN program, you'll make more money as a 4 year RN and the programs are a bit easier to get into because everyone else seems to want the shorter 2 year program.<br>  <br>  Just be sure you have your current transcripts evaluated by someone at the University so you know you'll be able to earn  your RN before you hit the 180 mark.  Also, all schools have an appeals process for the max hours attempted.  Talk to your fin aid office, they will tell you the procedures for a financial aid appeal for too many hours attempted.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	Is there an academic counselor at your school you can talk to?

Use synomyms--costly, unaffordable, steep, pricey, extravagant, etc.  Also, your sentences tend to be rather short and choppy.

Well College is the answer, at outrageous costs of anywhere from $2000 upwards of $10 000 per semester, it's making students broke. Additionally along with tuition, other expenses are using up all leftover cash, for example books typically cost between $100 and $500 each term; not to mention writing utensils, and other supplies. Thus College can drain any students saving account immensly, which in turn may result in a lack of a head start on living and breaking free of college into the 'real world'.<br>  <br>  <br>  There, I would make that beggining paragraph and then the rest can be in your following three paragraphs and conclusions. I made up a thesis at the end, I'm not totally absolutley sure of your topic so you might want to revise it.  Try using richer vocabulary, and transition words to enhance your essay. Hope I helped.  P.S. I have 98% in English but am only in grade 10 so idk <3|`|vQy7V6ZMaa	Going to college can be expensive. College tuition ALONG WITH(don't use and twice) room and board can cost anywhere from $2,000 to more than $10,000 per semester,[ but other expenses make going to college even more expensive.] (maybe change to something like "add in books & cost of living & your college expenses shoot through the roof!") For example, books typically cost between $100 and $500 each term. Materials are also very expensive. Paper, notebooks, writing utensils, and other supplies required(add in a comma) often cost more at the college bookstore than at any local discount department store. For instance, a package of notepaper costing $2 at a discount store might cost $5 at a college bookstore. In addition, there are all kinds of special fees added onto the bill at registration time. A college student might have to pay a $50 insurance fee, a $20 activity fee, a $15 fee to the student government association and anywhere from $500 to $100 (500-100??? you mean 100-500 or 500-1000) for parking. There is another fee if a student decides to add or drop classes after registration.(since you used there in the next sentence try changing this one to something like " If you decide to drop a class expect to pay a fine for that too") The fees never seem to end. There is money wasted for entertaining oneself, for example going to watch movies or eating out or going to water parks in the summer with friends. (don't use for example twice... try changing around the sentence some) College can be very expensive because of all the expenses and (maybe add make it hidden fees) fees.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read through and my corrections are pretty much self explanatory. Make sure you aren't too repetitive on your word usage & sentence structure. Your overall paper was good, I just added suggestions more than corrections.

AA11103615	Chief Sitting Bull <br>  Tatanka Iyotaka<br>  1831-1890<br>  Hunkpapa Sioux Leader and Medicine Man<br>   <br>  <br>  SITTING BULL, Sioux chief, born about 1837.  He was the principal chief of the Dakota Sioux, who were driven from their reservation in the Black Hills by miners in 1876, and took up arms against the whites and friendly Indians, refusing to be transported to the Indian territory. In June, 1876, they defeated and massacred Gen. George A. Custer's advance party of Gen. Alfred H. Terry's column, which was sent against them, on Little Big Horn River.  They were pursued northward by General Terry. <br>  <br>  Sitting Bull, with a part of his band, made his escape into British Territory, and, through the mediation of Dominion officials, surrendered on a promise of pardon in 1880. In July and August, 1888, in a conference at Standing Rock, Dakota, he influenced his tribe to refuse to relinquish Indian lands.  <br>  <br>  He died in 1890 when followers tried to rescue him from the reservation police.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saturday, December 15th, 2002 was  the 112th Memorial anniversary of the assassination of Tatanka Iyotaka, more commonly known as Sitting Bull. This inspirational leader was murdered deep within Lakota Nation territory, a vast area encompassing much of the central and northern Great Plains. Tatanka Iyotaka in his day was one of the most influential leaders on the prairie. Today, he is the most recognizable Indian in the world.<br>  <br>  Tatanka Iyotaka was not impressed by white society and their version of civilization. He was shocked and saddened to see the number of homeless people living on the streets of American cities. He gave money to hungry white people many times when he was in the large cities.<br>  <br>  He counseled his people to be wary of what they accept from white culture. He saw some things which might benefit his people; but cautioned Indian people to accept only those things that were useful to us, and to leave everything else alone. Tatanka Iyotaka was a man of clear vision and pure motivation.<br>  <br>  As is often the case with extraordinary people, Tatanka Iyotaka was murdered by his own people. The colonial force set the weak of his own race against him. A tactic they continue to use. Indian police today carry on the tradition started by the assassins of Tatanka Iyotaka and Tasunke Witko. Indian police harassing, arresting, even killing other Indian people keeps the colony in control. Seeing that their paychecks, just like those of the elected tribal/band councilors, come from the colonial government points to that quite clearly.<br>  <br>  The unrelenting love for his land and his people caused the enemies of the Lakota to fear Tatanka Iyotaka. The Hunkpapa Oyate and the Titonwan Lakota had many powerful leaders, but Tatanka Iyotaka will forever remain the icon of traditional, full-blood strength and dignity.

I haven't heard of any bad effects from track lighting.

Possibly their memory was keyed to details of the study environment.  You might improve your results by making your study room similar to the room where your test will be given, but I still think you'll get more mileage out of doing extra study so you will have mastery of the subject.

t79pLOCUaa	You have quite a few spelling errors so I must assume you have not bothered to read it yourself.<br>  'Years ago, in generations past'. Advertising of cigarettes only goes back to the 1880s or so, so how many generations are we talking about? 6? 5? 7?<br>  <br>  I suggest that you edit this and take out the emotional tone so that it reads like a research paper. That is with an objective, rather than subjective, viewpoint.<br>  <br>  I think you should use percentages in your work, instead of 'many'.  You state that 'many teenagers do not take a smoke or drink', and then in the next sentence state that these are 'few and far between'.<br>  Please make up your mind, and give references to support your conflicting findings!<br>  <br>  <br>  My advice is to take a deep breath and start again.
W3UYWpxiaa	I'm my school each grade level has one and we share it.  Everyone has their day to use the board and the kids do love it.  The school system bought all of our boards and they are pretty expensive.  It's not something you can buy yourself and be reimbursed for.  I suggest you look online to see if there are any grants you can get to buy one for your class.  If you can't find any grants try one of the new projectors.  You can plug them up to your laptop and bring up websites so the kids can still use technology, but it's a lot cheaper (about $800).  The down side is that either you or the students would have to be at the laptop to type in information or click links.|`|PK9R1V8gaa	my 7th grade math teacher had one last year, and i really enjoyed it! it made the class more entertaining and interactive, and plus the technology was pretty cool :)<br>  the school will probably cover the money, or at least part of it since it's a learning tool, and if they don't you could ask a couple of other teachers if they would like to split the cost and share the board.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	sure...if you can afford it<br>  <br>  because those things are very useful|`|VEScnfoHaa	Depending on the school district, your school might pay for it. My district has smart boards in every classroom in the middle school and high school and are thinking about getting more for the elementary schools. They are very useful and helpful and way better than chalk or white boards. Also (preferred for math classes), there are Senteos. Senteos are clickers that students can use to answer questions and then the results show up on the smart board. It tells you how many students got it right/wrong, what their answers were, who got it wrong/right and many other things. They are very helpful in math classrooms.<br>  Also, bumping into the Smart Board is not as serious to where you have to collaborate it all of the time. If the smart board does get bumped and the positioning messes up, collaborating it only takes a couple of seconds. Smart Boards aren't that much of a hassle.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	If your district isn't buying them for the school as a whole, I would think that it is unlikely that you would get one. Budgets are set a long time out and there isn't a lot of "wiggle room" in them. If you really want one, look for a grant or maybe get the kids to fund raise. Make sure if you decide to buy it that there is no question of who owns it - if you change jobs you want everyone to know that it is YOURS.<br>  The other thing that I would think about is the effectiveness of an IWB as a learning tool. It is fun and cool, but the research is less convincing. There was some work done in the UK about 2 years ago that suggested that any gains in learning were temporary and that within 2 years the gap between classrooms with and without IWBs closed entirely. If you are only interested in the fun aspect - go for it.|`|UKNTYisAaa	If it is expensive then probably the school wont pay for it because of the bad economy. But think first, is the smart board worth it?|`|2p0UEczoaa	I have both a smartboard and a projector connected to the internet in my classroom.  The smartboard is about 2000 - 2500 and the projector is probably another 1000-1500.  The smartboard I could do with out.  It is all bells and whistles that are ultimately not too useful.  Instead, try a projector projecting onto a white board and get a wireless mouse and keyboard.  I got mine through a grant but our school has recently been purchasing the projectors without the smartboards.  I don't thing the boards are worth the money given our financial limitations.  You need to talk to the powers that be about paying for the technology.  Go right in and tell the principal that you would like her support in trying out some of this new technology.  Hope this helps.  Emai me if you have more questions.|`|O6EV0oSeaa	Hello. I am in 7th grade, and your a 7th grade math teacher :o,<br>  also when I was in 6th grade we used a smart board reguarly.

mjtL0w0taa	The $18,000 is split into two portions. Call them x and y:<br>  <br>  x + y = 18000<br>  <br>  Assume that for x, the rate is 5% or 0.05 interest and that for y. the rate is 6.4% or 0.064. The total interest is the two amounts combined:<br>  <br>  (x * 0.05) + (y * 0.064) = 1103<br>  <br>  The next thing to do is to use the first equation to express y in terms of x:<br>  <br>  x + y = 18000<br>  <br>  Subtract x from both sides to get:<br>  <br>  y = 18000 - x<br>  <br>  You can now substitute the expression 18000 - x for the y term in the second equation:<br>  <br>  (x * 0.05) + (y * 0.064) = 1103<br>  <br>  becomes:<br>  <br>  (x * 0.05) + [(18000 - x) * 0.064] = 1103<br>  <br>  This can be multiplied out as:<br>  <br>  (x * 0.05) + (18000 * 0.064) - (x * 0.064) = 1103<br>  <br>  Combine like terms:<br>  <br>  (x * 0.05) - (x * 0.064) + 1152 = 1103<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  -(x * 0.014) = 1103 - 1152 <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  -(x * 0.014) = -49<br>  <br>  Divide both sides by -0.014 to get the value of x:<br>  <br>  x = 3500<br>  <br>  Since x + y = 18000, the y amount is 18000 minus the x amount:<br>  <br>  y = 18000 - 3500 = 14500<br>  <br>  To check this, multiply the x and y amounts times their interest rates to confirm that the combined interest adds up to $1103.|`|wFGdclPNaa	To answer this question, it helps to realize that there are two amounts that add up to $18,000 that were invested.  Lets call those two amounts x and y.  In other words, x+y=$18,000.<br>  <br>  y is also equal to 18,000 - x by moving the x to the other side of the equation.  So now we have x + (18,000 - x) = $18,000.  <br>  <br>  We know the normal way to figure simple interest would be <br>  (.064)x +  (.05)y = $1103 but that looks unsolvable because you have two variables.  But if we substitute (18,000 - x) for y we now have a single variable equation that is now solvable.<br>  <br>  Now equation for the total amount of interest earned on the two accounts together is (.064)x + (.05) (18,000 - x) = $1103.<br>  <br>  By working the math, <br>  (.064)x + (.05) (18,000 - x) = $1103<br>  (.064)x+ (900) - (.05)x = 1103 (using the distributive property)<br>  .064x - .05x + 900 = 1103 (get like terms together)<br>  .014x + 900 = 1103 (combine like terms)<br>  .014x = 1103 - 900 (move 900 to the other side and subtract)<br>  .014x= 203 (Now divide both sides by .014)<br>  x = $14,500<br>  <br>  If x = $14,500 ,(the first amount invested ) then remember that<br>  ($18,000 - x) = y, so the second amount in the other account is $3,500.<br>  <br>  Always check your answer by plugging it back in the original equation to make sure it works.

At my school if you have above 3.5 you can get special permission to take more than 19 to finish school faster but you have to show that you are academically stable to handle that much course work.<br>  <br>  Courses are broken into "hours" and average for a full time college student is 15 credit hours or about 4-5 classes.<br>  <br>  Ex. <br>  <br>  English would be 3 credit hours<br>  Math would be 4 credit hours<br>  Language would be 5 credit hours<br>  Science would be 3 credit hours<br>  <br>  Totaling 15 Credit hours<br>  <br>  However each college breaks up credit hours differently and basically the more credit hours you take the more work you should expect to do inside and outside the class room.<br>  <br>  Plus classes wouldn't be every day usually they are broken into MWF or TR (or combination of that) <br>  <br>  Hope this helped you

Add the reason why you brought the box cutter in the<br>  first place. Incorperate this in with<br>  the first paragraph. After your apology<br>  add the school rules against bringing<br>  weapons to school. State why you chose<br>  to ignore the rule. Be sincere. Good<br>  luck.

WpH9zProaa	Dwight David “Ike” Eisenhower (October 14, 1890 – March 28, 1969) was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 and a five-star general in the United States Army. During the Second World War, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, with responsibility for planning and supervising the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45. In 1951, he became the first supreme commander of NATO.[1]<br>  <br>  As President, he oversaw the cease-fire of the Korean War, kept up the pressure on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, made nuclear weapons a higher defense priority, launched the Space Race, enlarged the Social Security program, and began the Interstate Highway System. He was the last World War I veteran to serve as U.S. president.|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	Do a google search on Eisenhower and World War II.

F2rI3Juaaa	If you show that you are consistently improving - You are showing that you are maturing and have an ability to learn - To me, you are on the right track - Don't Worry!|`|KTM6D9Aqaa	I am a junior in high school so I can kind of help... The grades you get aren't the most important things colleges look at, getting an A in Woman's Choir is not the same as getting an A in AP US History. Colleges also look at how well-rounded an individual you are and your test scores (SAT, ACT etc.) I got a semi-bad grade my freshman year, but I have tried to make it up by getting the best grades possible, like you. Also, see if there is a possibility of taking the class again online, just so that you can try to get a better grade. When you are applying to colleges (which you really don't have to do until end of junior year, beginning of senior year) find that colleges that you want to go to and see what requirements they have. Also if asked about your poor grades, try to explain your situation the best you can. I know I wrote alot but I have a younger sister (also a sophomore) is kind of like you, so I know what I am talking about. Hoped it helped!

QD54HVsPaa	Dropping out of school at age 16 is not encouraged here in the States.  However, by law, a student cannot legally drop out of school until the age of 16.  Ideally, students stay in school until graduation, which, for most students, is age 18.  <br>  <br>  The good news is that most students do stay in school, graduate, and continue their education at the university level, the community college level, or at a vocational school.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	In high school you're usually between the ages of 12 or 13 to 17 to 19, depending on how old you were when you started school.  "Dropping out" usually means somewhere around age 16 here, too, although most do it in their junior or senior year, so about age 16 to 18.  Usually you graduate high school and get your diploma at age 17 to 19.  It is hard to get a job that pays more than minimum wage without graduating from high school.|`|Afz5TBrUaa	16 is the legal age but at any age your parents/guardians can fill out forms claiming that they're "homeschooling" you.|`|fPavekfeaa	In the US typical age at graduation from High School is 18. Although 18 is also the age of majority so at this point a person is allowed to drop out without any questions being asked. Dropping out before this is generally a civil crime before the age of 18. Some states have provisions where a student may drop out at 16 provided proof of having a full time job can be shown or if the students parent or legal guardian signs consent forms. These sorts of laws vary from state to state.<br>  <br>  Some other students may drop out of academic schooling and change to a vocational program at the High School level which is typically age 14 - 15. This is dependent on the school district and what is available in the area where the student attends school.<br>  <br>  There are many more scenarios than this where say a student might drop out and run away from home. This is not technically legal, but scenarios like this do occur.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	same with us. you can drop out once you get to be sixteen.With guardians' consent, of course. Throughout high school at my school, you're 14 through 17. that would be ninth grade, tenth grade, eleventh grade, and twelfth grade. HighSchool is not a choice until you get to be sixteen, and even then, you're basically throwing away all your chances of getting a proper job when you drop out.|`|FFh7x8a1aa	I have a late birthday (august) and so i'm about one year younger than most of my class<br>  When i was in kindergarten I just turned 5 while others were turning 6.<br>  <br>       me      most others<br>  1st:6           7<br>  2nd:7          8<br>  3rd:8           9<br>  4th:9          10<br>  5th:10        11<br>  6th:11        12<br>  7th:12        13<br>  8th:13        14<br>  9th:14        15<br>  10th:15      16<br>  11th:16      17<br>  12th:17      18<br>  <br>  At the age of 16 students are legally allowed to drop out although in my town they offer a alternative option which is to go to a school where all the work is done in school. classes are shorter school gets out earlyer and so on.

AA10407542	If this is for your homework, I think I understand the questions “intent” You should look into the theorist mentioned above for your answer.  The physical environment is obviously important but I haven’t seen where the giants of child development have actually given huge samples of how it should be and why.  I do however think that with some understanding of some of the key concepts you could do this assignment easily.  I will give you two mentioned by others, and the rest is up to you.  When you complete this assignment you will have a very good understanding of not only what the general theory is of these people, but something probably more important, APPLICATION!<br>  <br>  Howard Gardner.  Basically he came up with a variety of intelligences that we have.  The standardized tests, IQ tests, etc. are dispelled in a way by Gardner because they measure a particular type of intelligence but do not measure others.  Being aware of the others helps you to arrange the physical environment in ways that might facilitate for these others.  (Look them up, 7 major intelligences according to Gardner)  So, let’s take one, interpersonal intelligence.  Your class would be facilitating for this need by “allowing” for children to talk, negotiate, and explain, to others around them.  How might you set up an art area that promotes this more than others?  Look up the intelligences and you will solve this and own it yourself.<br>  <br>  Vygotsky.  Look at some of his main work that focuses on the aspects of “scaffolding.”  Learners of different skill levels can actually work together to solve problems and gain competency.  (lots of cultural aspects too, look him up for sure!)  You could say that your environment was in support of Vygotsky with the openness of learners in activities.  There aren’t desks or children apart from one another while learning.  You will think of many more with just a bit of thought.<br>  <br>  Ok, just read the theory and how a class could be in support of it.  I would say you will have some good understanding after.  I won’t do your homework for you but hope this helps you get there.|`|8SmAx9veaa	It would be a lot of stuff to type out on each of the theorist that have worked with children. Some great ones to look into will be:<br>  <br>  John Dewey<br>  <br>  Erik Erikson<br>  Jean Piaget<br>  Lev Vygotsky<br>  <br>  Also look at Howard Gardner<br>  <br>  These are ones I know you can find a lot of information on also if you can find the book An Introduction to Dewey Montessori Erikson Piaget & Vygotsky.  By Carol Garhart Mooney it will help you with alot of information. The ISBN is 978-1-884834-85-1<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped you.|`|klGRR0f9aa	Try searching for Valsiner or Piaget

xfqHi1tRaa	I know I've answered questions for you before! Did you listen? Many of these same issues were addressed.<br>  <br>  1. Study abroad usually refers to university students or students traveling independently outside of an exchange program (less usual). With those, you handle the arrangements on your own, pay all your own fees, arrange for a place to stay and a school, your own insurance, etc. A foreign exchange program (AFS, YFU, Rotary, etc.), should you go that way, will handle all of that for a fee that you pay them. <br>  <br>  2. If you want to go independently, yes. It will help to have a sponsor in the country. If you go with a program, possibly, if you go as a direct placement (which I have mentioned to you before).<br>  <br>  3. How do we know if your school has a program? We don't know what school you go to. However, most public schools do not. You go through a traditional program. If you are a decent student, your school allows you to go and even grants at least SOME credit for it. Your counselor will have the information.<br>  <br>  4. If you go independently, you may need to know Japanese. If you go with a program, no. It's not expected. You will have a "language camp" in the beginning and then the schools will work with you.<br>  <br>  5. You can take the SATs in Japan. They are in English. Contact the company for a schedule.<br>  <br>  6. It's generally not your school that will make the decision, it's the exchange organization. Your grades must be high enough to show you can have academic success in the country you want to go to. Usually a B will do the trick, but it wouldn't hurt to get that up some. There may be higher requirements for study abroad.<br>  <br>  7. Pros -- language immersion, independence. Cons -- none that I can think of.<br>  <br>  8. Yes, this is a global economy. Many Japanese companies operate in the US -- I have a friend who is a manager in one right now would have loved this opportunity. He would be able to understand his bosses and the people he works with much better. Also, foreign language fluency can add $10,000 to a starting salary (depending upon the language).|`|1FsjbbNHaa	1) From what I've heard, they're pretty much just different words for the same thing. Usually, with a foreign exchange program, it involves staying with a host family, but with studying abroad, you might stay with a host family or you may attend boarding school. It's your choice, really.<br>  2) Definitely.<br>  3) No, it doesn't have to. You can usually go through an outside of school program (but it would be awesome if your school already set something up). It also depends on what sort of school you already go to. If you go to a public school, you should have no problems and all you'll need to do is tell them you're leaving for however long you're leaving. If you go to a private school, it can get complicated and you'll probably have to pay full tuition for the amount of time you're gone. Regardless, I suggest speaking with a school counselor. <br>  4) You don't need to know Japanese, but you should learn as much as possible before you leave. Once you arrive, there should be someone there to help you get adjusted to the language. I'm not really sure on whether or not you'll be instructed in Japanese. It's best to talk to the school you're thinking of applying to in regards to that.<br>  5) That is when you would typically take SATs, but you can request to take them in 10th grade. If you did decide to take them in 11th, you can always request them in English and they should comply with no difficulties.<br>  6) Yes, same as applying to any school. If your grades are above a C though, you should be fine (just don't expect to get into any top schools, as they take grades and schoolwork very seriously in Japan).<br>  7) Pros: Learn a new culture, language, etc.; Colleges love this sort of thing; Make connections in Japan; Have fun.<br>  Cons: Culture shock (though I wouldn't worry too much about it since you've already been several times); Loneliness; Homesickness.<br>  8) I don't think it would be pointless at all. You'll make friends that will last a lifetime and experience a totally new adventure (cheesy, I know, but true). I also don't think it'll be that hard if you just remember to keep up with your schoolwork (don't slack off!). Remember, they send your transcripts back to your home country, so you get credit for all of your work.<br>  I wish you all the best!

3LjMWownaa	Hmm... that is a very interesting question.<br>  <br>  I too started when I was 18, I will be graduating this year actually, before I turn 20.  In my course I do notice that the older students understand the concepts more and have an easier time than the rest of us.  Possibly because they have their life together and know where they want to go.  Where as the rest of the students may have felt like they were pushed into a higher education and there was no stopping right after high school.<br>  <br>  At the start of the course, I was excited.  But no I'm not all that into it.  I do enjoy it at times, but I need the right inspiration and there is a bit of a learning curve on what I want to do.<br>  <br>  I don't necessarily feel that there should be an age requirement because those who are ready, shouldn't be held back.  But those who aren't exactly sure what they want to do should at least have more of a choice.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who dropped out during the 2nd year because it wasn't what he wanted to do, which is sad to see that he wasted so much money only to find out so late that its not what he wanted.<br>  <br>  But... I guess I would have to agree with you :)<br>  <br>  edit: Like you said about the money, we're just putting ourselves in a hole when we take out student loans to pay for something we don't really want to do.  Where as if we were to take a year after high school, and actually work to get some money, we wouldn't be digging ourselves into a hole, or a big one anyways.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	hehe|`|KOj8XOHPaa	Age does not necessarily bring wisdom and intellectual maturity.  <br>  <br>  Financial independence is the first issue that comes to mind when I read this.  I believe that 18-19 is a prime year to start college for a number of reasons pertaining to this.  The older you get, the more obligations one has than to work on their grade point average.  Rent, utilities, phone bills, insurance, children (if you have them), etc.  You basically need a full time job to sufficiently supplement these things.  Coincidentally, you get the better job if you were in college in your 18th or 19th year when you had fewer obligations and more time to devote to school.  There is a reason why people say that it's hard to actually go back to school when you're older.  This isn't the rule, just the outcome of most.  <br>  <br>  At 18-19, if you are a full time student, you may still remain on your parent's insurance plan all the way until age 24, I believe.  After that, you're on your own, and how do you think most people acquire insurance?  A full-time job.  Guess what you DON'T have time for, then?  Beer-bongs and mid-terms.  <br>  <br>  At 18, one can drive, vote for a president, smoke, go to jury duty, marry without parental consent, and many other things that give way into the adult world.  Time to take both responsibility AND advantage of the fact that you can be treated like an adult while still enjoying the luxuries of your parent's or guardian's financial support.  Time to GROW UP and take college seriously.  <br>  <br>  As for the ones who drop out due to the reasons you stated. . . think of it as survival of the fittest (though there are always different circumstances).  College isn't for everyone.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Personally I believe that people should defer at least a year (and still be able to use their scholarships, ect without penalty) so that the can be sure that they even want to go to college and be sure which path they want to take, I have seen too many think they want to go towards this career path and then they graduate college with a degree that they have no interest in.

lQIKWXDuaa	I really think it is a good idea to have a double major or double degree. The economy is not doing so well at the moment so it is an excellent idea to do that.  I think you should do what you are passionate about.  If you dont have a preference yet, check out the careers that are in demand in your state at the moment. Try the medical field, business or education. A double degree makes you more marketable and will give you options when you graduate. Good Luck to you!!! <br>  <br>  ss

You can get into a great graduate program from any undergrad school, including Kansas, but grades aren't everything - although they count quite a bit.  Astrophysics and physics grad programs will expect a physics major, at least a 3.5 GPA, high GRE scores, good physics GRE scores, great recommendations, and research experience.  I had all that and even publications and I didn't get into the top astronomy grad programs - but that's ok, because there are about a hundred astronomy or physics grad programs out there with great professors and experts in their fields which aren't ivies.  And some of the top astrophysics programs - like Berkeley, CalTech, Arizona, UT Austin, U Chicago - aren't ivies either.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine - just get research experience as soon as possible.  Starting at community college, you'll probably have to wait until junior year, but find a project as soon as you can.

If you cross one time zone you go either back or forward one hour (one hour forward if you are traveling east, one hour back if you are traveling west).|`|H8moHsL7aa	It could mean the longitude lines on a world map, because they represent time zones.<br>  <br>  In which case I think they equal 2 hours  each, then and hour would be half a longitude.<br>  <br>  So using that theory no it is not Equivelent to an hour.<br>  <br>  But on the other hand if they are asking about time zones across Australia. when daylight saving is not in use, we have WA on one zone, south Australia and the NT 1.5 hrs ahead of WA and the East coast 2 hrs ahead of WA,<br>  <br>  So that answer would also be No.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, gotta go get my grandson..<br>  <br>  Peace and blessings|`|klOP21xTaa	No it isn't, here in the UK it is 21:12 EST is 5 hrs behind CST is 6 hrs behind, PST is 7 hrs behind, it very much depends on where you are in relation a particular place.|`|9haTWuHsaa	i would say no because in some parts of the world, there are 1/2 time zones. check this website out, maybe it'll help.

5EGm6ZLhaa	Yes there is, but only if you have a significant amount of money to do so. <br>  <br>  Education and living expenses in the United States, for international students, will cost you an average $35K ($23K tuition at a public school and $12K in living expenses) per year, even more depending on the university you decide to attend. If you attend a community college you get the tuition down to around $8K a year, with living expenses you are looking at $20K, minimum.<br>  <br>  Advise, talk to your parents about your goals because they will be the people who would be funding your studies.|`|XbpJO3jHaa	Yes but it is more expensive, especially for the good universities.

vMthRkrsaa	You can get an LPN (Licensed practical nurse) which is equivalent to an associates degree. (2 years)  <br>  <br>   RN (Registered Nurse)  which is equivalent to a Bachelors degree.

Masters degree (6 years if you are real smart)|`|8376bdc87fccc5f06632449f618f2e8eaa	It's easy, when you go to HS and graduate from 12th grade, you get a HS diploma. When you go off to college and make it to your senior year, you graduate with a bachelor's degree. In College, there are all sorts of degrees, depending upon what you decide to study. What you decide to study is called your "major". So, you major may be nursing, business, marketing, animal science, english, and on and on. Now, your major will fall into one of two categories, science or arts. So, since Nursing is science-related, it would be a Bachelor of Science degree. If you majored in English, it would be a Bachelor of Arts degree.<br>  <br>  Once you graduate from college, then you apply to Nursing school to become a licensed nurse.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helped.|`|Rsr8nngWaa	You need a B.S. in nursing to qualify to take the test to be a RN, which is the only way to make good money in Nursing.|`|16JFIhD8aa	a Bachelor of Science is shortened to BSc, which is a degree. If it's done at university and some colleges it's often an honors degree ("BSc honors").<br>  <br>  There's also BEng (Bachelors of engineering)<br>  <br>  and BA (Bachelor of Arts)<br>  <br>  And a degree is a very good professional qualification basically.|`|klOP21xTaa	bachelors degree is the first degree you get, then masters then Phd, just a title, probs qualifies you to practice nursing.|`|Oyktk3rHaa	good choice here r some options <br>  u could go to college for 2 years start working but continue your degree in college <br>  or<br>  do the full 4 years... <br>  <br>  <br>  if thats what u wanted|`|On9zqYl0aa	I'm sure there are several types of nursing degrees you could earn. A BS is a Bachelor of Science and would be a 4 year degree. They may also offer some certificate programs and/or AS Associate of Science which would be a 2 year degree. I would get in contact with an advisor at a nursing school to help you with your more detailed question. Good Luck!! :)

But I have moved five times, and at every school, the popular people are athletic, outgoing, attractive, clean, and confident. Being rich, slutty (this usually makes you popular with guys and despised by girls), and/or having connections doesn't hurt either.|`|LwywrSRkaa	This is what some of the respected, popular, friendly people are like at my school and it is similar almost at every school (snobby ones are very different, they are rich, b**chy etc.):<br>  <br>  *Friendly<br>  *Smart<br>  *Do sports<br>  *Hang around with girls a lot<br>  *Become teacher's pets<br>  *Be known in every year group<br>  *Do things like school assemblies<br>  *Basically know about the latest things<br>  *Confident<br>  *Show off about their god skills<br>  *Friendly with everyone!

You don't need to go to Harvard to get that.

If you are a good reader, you will most likely not have any trouble with the multiple choice part of the writing section, but you do have to write an essay, so writing skills are important.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Does not matter. Courses are courses especially at the same institution they are completely equal.  Credit hours dictate the same level of classroom time and work.  Grad committees don't care when you took a course, just that you took it, and the grade you got.  <br>  <br>  With that said, summer courses are less forgiving in terms of grading due to the compressed schedule.  Very easy to screw up and get a bad grade (to some, even a B is a bad grade if you're shooting for grad/med school) so there is validity in using caution with summer attendance, just not in the way you suggested.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I got behind in my coursework at school because I chose to study abroad.  I took a few classes to catch me up over the summer.  I think the grad schools look at overall performance not when you took the class.  Note, one of my closest friends failed chemistry twice and still got into a good biochemistry program.  They looked at her overall performance.|`|1ab8cee1141a9c2947e3a140c1b98511aa	Spring and summer semesters only look bad in high school. In a university setting the classes are usually accelerated but are just as valid and favored as fall and winter terms. Having to retake classes does hurt your GPA and thus may hinder grad school status.

YMI6Yl18aa	1) In your drawer you have 23 socks altogether. For you to pick one white one on your first go, the probablility is:<br>  <br>  10/23<br>  <br>  Having picked one sock, you are left with 22 socks in your drawer. Assuming your first one was white, you are left with nine white socks out of those 22. So the probablility of your second sock being white is:<br>  <br>  9/22. <br>  <br>  Remember when you have two probablilities, if you want A and B you multiply the two numbers. If, however, you want A or B, you add the two numbers. Here we would do:<br>  <br>  10/23 x 9/22<br>  = 45/253<br>  <br>  2) For the coin to show heads, the probability is 1/2. For the die to show 3, the probability is 1/6. Therefore the probability of getting both is:<br>  <br>  1/2 x 1/6<br>  =1/12|`|Gq1rl0Ddaa	I like these problems... First one, the probability that the first and second sock are both red is (7/23) times (6/22)<br>  That means, that the answer is 42/506. There is an 8.3% chance that both the first and second sock are red.<br>  <br>  The probability that the coin shows the head = 1/2. The probability that the die shows 3 = 1/6. Both of them together? multiply the probabilities.<br>  <br>  (1/2) times (1/6) equals 1/12.<br>  <br>  1/12 = an 8.3% chance that the head shows and the 3 shows.<br>  <br>  In other words, both probabilities are the SAME!!! thats interesting...<br>  <br>  except 1/12 is 0.083333333333333333333333333333 et cetra, and 42/506 is something weirder.|`|nstz1Lkeaa	so to do all of these you need to do the probability out of all of the socks so you would add them up to make your probabilities out of 23.<br>  for the white sock one, it would be 10 out of 23 because there are 10 white socks out of all of the socks. for the second one, it would be 9 out of 22 because you had taken 1 away from the white socks and 1 from the total amount of socks.<br>  <br>  for the second one, you multiply together the probabilities of both.<br>  so, the probability of the coin showing heads is 1 out of 2, and the probability of the die showing the #3 is 1 out of 6, because that is 1 of the 6 sides of the die. to figure out the probability of BOTH, you multiply the 1/2 x 1/6 in order to get a 1 out of 12 chance of getting both<br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|hat60KYXaa	The first person to answer this question had their math right, but did it for red socks, not white.

VoHiid17aa	It is a bad score. If I remember right, a person who just guesses all of the answers or puts the same letter for every answer gets an 18, and you got less than that.<br>  <br>  The good news is that you're only in seventh grade and most of the stuff they test you on you'll learn in the years to come. The best way to practice for the ACT is to practice! The main problem with people taking the ACT is that they run out of time, so by knowing what kinds of questions to expect, what to look for as you read, how to attack a math problem, will really increase your score.<br>  <br>  Invest in one or two books with strategies and practice tests. The first time I took it, I had taken two or three practice tests. The second time, I had taken a course (about $200, I think) and a couple practice tests and improved my score by 5 points, which may have been the difference between getting a full tuition scholarship and a full tuition/room/board scholarship. <br>  <br>  I would not take the ACT again until you are taking it to get into college, which is junior year and into senior year.

1gyzz3kxaa	Writers often blend objective and subjective description to balance factual detail with the power of emotional impressions. Popular biographies, news magazines, and marketing materials often present a mix of fact and image. By blending objective and subjective elements, writers can provide readers with both logical and emotional appeals:<br>  <br>  Every six minutes someone dies of hunger and disease in the refugee camp. Drought has destroyed the people's ability to grow food. With only a cup of rice a day to sustain them, orphans have left the camp to beg along the highways. Unless you help, many of them will not survive more than a month.<br>  <br>  Blended descriptions seek to enliven factual detail, to put a human face on statistics.<br>   <br>  Blended descriptions generally avoid long blocks of dry facts or highly sensational images. <br>  <br>  Blended descriptions are effective in reaching a mass audience. <br>  <br>  ***check out the entire page..a lot of great examples and explanations. :)
hFpbidA2aa	umm this is NOT ivy league material.   <br>  your good for a good university with a name like Villanova, Fordham, GWU, and NYU.<br>  <br>  go to:<br>  Collegeboard.com<br>  Princetonreview.com <br>  TheU.com [shows videos of some colleges and info about them.]<br>  <br>  they have things that show you the average GPA to get into each school and etc. <br>  <br>  <br>  you must take all honors classes no matter how hard it is. Schools really like it when you try to push yourself into difficult classes. dont get me wrong, your doing really good, but try to push yourself harder and not think to yourself that your scared you will not do good. <br>  <br>  i suggest you take all honors and more than 3 AP classes cause i took like 8 IB courses which are the same as AP. i am a junior now and take 4 IB classes now and next year 5 IB classes. <br>  <br>  push yourself to get even a higher average than a B.<br>  freshman yr, i had a C average. Sophomore year i had a B average, and now junior year i have a A to A+ average. i pushed myself cause i want to become something when im older.<br>  <br>  <br>  and the SAT''s arent that easy, so dont judge your grade already cause you never know. i knew a kid who was VERY smart and recieved a 1450 on his SAT. <br>  <br>  <br>  join clubs, sports, and you already play instrument which is good. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think these schools would be good for you:<br>  Boston University<br>  NYU<br>  Villanova<br>  Fordham<br>  University of Rochester<br>  Syracuse University<br>  Penn State<br>  Widener University<br>  University of Connecticut<br>  UCLA.<br>  etc.

LYrSOdCBaa	Colleges look if you took rigorous courses. They will understand if you get a low grade but in a AP class. I'm a junior and i have taken 6 AP classes already. The great thing about AP classes is the 10 points it adds to the final grade so the highest grade possible to get is 110. I encourage you to take AP classes. Colleges will see that you are prepared for college level work. If you get 3,4, or, 5 on the AP exam then you get college credit as an added bonus. If you fail the AP exam, then when you go to college you would think the class is easy because you already learned some of the stuff.|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	You won't necessarily get a bad grade if you take an AP class...the only problem is that you actually have to try to get an A.<br>  <br>  You should take AP classes mainly for the major that you are interested in, such as Chem AP if you are interested in a chem major.  <br>  <br>  You can also take other classes to get college credit, so that you have less general education to do as a freshman in college. <br>   - (like, if you hate spanish class, take Spanish AP so that you don't have to take foreign language classes in college)<br>  <br>  average # is pretty much zero...not that many kids take AP,  - a small percent take a lot of AP classes, like 6 overall, with some kids who take only one or two, and the rest of the school population take zero<br>  <br>  and you can't really know whether universities look more at AP classes than GPA...|`|pSbqOO7zaa	just take one AP class at first,they are alot of work,if u are getting below a C drop out and stick with honors.<br>  <br>  colleges will like a 3.5 gpa with AP and honors classes better than a 4.0 with all normal classes..<br>  <br>  take an AP class on a subject you enjoy.

Even if you are not a believer, many (maybe most) people feel like the earth is on a path toward destruction.  Many feel like either mankind will destroy it with over-farming, pollution, and "global warming", or it will be destroyed in a "nuclear holocaust", or a giant meteor or comet will eventually hit it, or perhaps the Sun will go supernova and engulf it.

While I think there is some merit in students having them in case of emergencies, those happen very rarely, and the downside of having students use them for social reasons is far greater than the need to have them for emergencies.    I noticed something on my college campus when cell phones became prevalent. Whereas the campus used to be a friendly place where everyone said hello to one another, suddenly everyone was busy with their phones (either talking or texting) and completely ignored the people around them. In other words, rather than trying to get to know new people, it just increased their contact with the ones they already knew. This destroyed school spirit and connections among students.    Cell phones also add another layer of rudeness to an environment. They are a distraction which keep people in their own little bubbles. People will stand in your way, ignore you, shout into phones so that you can't study, or conduct what would otherwise be private conversations and even fights right in your space.

But i could advise you on basic things such as:    Always have an introduction and conclusion (may seem silly, but it's ridiculous how many people lose marks on this).    Keep your essay simple, don't attempt to use words you are unsure about.    Avoid waffling points. Start with one point and explain it in as much detail as you can. You don't want to go back to a point and explain it unless it links with another point.    Ensure your essay has a natural flow and each point follows on.    Use good grammar and punctuation.    Avoid the first person pronoun 'I', only use it in your conclusion.    I must stress although it may seem obvious:    Your introduction must re-word the question, state how you will approach it and what points you will discuss.    Your conclusion must sum up all the points you made. Clearly state your overall view on the topic.     For extra marks, a 2,000 word essay should have at least 2-4 references.    Make sure you do a Bibliography.    You can't go wrong! Good luck.

DS2huIAkaa	What a strange project to choose!  Anyway,  Subject, object, distance, physical barrier, allocated time, control.    Subject: any age, any gender, any height, weight, colour etc  Object: movable, (and, perhaps, a weight limit set by Subject).  Distance: far enough to prevent physical contact by touch, breath  Barrier: good enough to prevent the above  Time: a "reasonable" period of time.  Control: checks of set-up before, during and after the end of the experiment.    If the Subject insists on having visual contact with object, object must be chosen to be non-ferrous or made of any other magnetic material.  The object should be enclosed in a mild steel cage offering magnetic and electrical shielding.  The  venue should be set by experimenter and there should be no access to it by the Subject (or any of his associates) before the experiment.    Good luck. A negative result is just as useful as a positive one.

GjtIXiK9aa	Temper here does not mean anger, but would have been used in Shakespeare's time to mean 'character'.  Romeo feels that his love for Juliet has weakened his ability to act in an appropriately macho way - he killed an enemy and should be proud of his part in the feud, but he is unhappy because he has caused Juliet pain by killing her relative.  Instead of feeling like a war hero, he feels like a murderer.    The other two questions require a depth of knowledge about the play, as well as male and female stereotypes of the 17th and 21st centuries.  You are going to have research for yourself as there are many perspectives e.g.  1.Romeo grows up when he discovers real love and is willing to sacrifice,   2.Romeo puts aside machoism and family duty and is weakened and blinded by his all-consuming passion for Juliet.  3. Juliet is a child with no experience of love or men   4. Juliet is a strong female and shows greater strength of will than Romeo|`|qgpXxcuGaa	"My temper softened valours steel" I'm guessing means his temper is so bad that it makes steel look soft    I'm a bit stuck on answering the others without going into immense essay-like detail on them, would have to pick out quotes and stuff

We all go through difficult times in our lives but it's up to you to decide if you want to gain from them or if you're going to suffer and then get nothing for it.    If you use the stress, the hardship or what ever as an excuse to not do anything, or to get someone else to get you out of the situation, then you won't gain anything from it....you'll need to go and ask for help again when you face another hard time.    If you struggle and get through it the best you can, gritting your teeth and pushing on forward, it's just like doing hard physical exercise, you end up getting stronger and the next time you run into another situation it will be easier.       The more you exercise you ability to push yourself through, the stronger you'll get and possibly you'll get to a point where situations which you now think of are impossible will be easy to face.

VERrlErvaa	Hi,    I live in Australia, but I think the answer would be the same anywhere... You obviously have a passion to help kids in need; talented kids who can't catch a break.  You have several options - teaching; social work (but not the kind where you are burning out); child psychology; an arts degree, followed up with a Master of Arts (specialising in something you are really passionate about in the arts: dance; photography.)    I think moving to the Bronx would give you a different perspective on life, too.  Which will help you when you return later to New Orleans; you will have a hopefully vast array of experience behind you.    You could even move to NY and look for a teen counselling centre and volunteer there while you are going to school and then set up something through there - dance classes, etc.    Pretty soon, life will lead you to your destiny... Just follow your dream and don't bypass any opportunity - that one little door might open up an entirely new dimension for you.    Good luck.  I am sure someone with your passion will do well wherever you will end up.

Kgi2RxhBaa	Student loans aren't considered "income" when you're applying for public aid programs like food stamps or Medicaid. A loan is not your money, because you have to pay it back.<br>  <br>  I'm unemployed, I live in public housing, and I'm living off my financial aid. My student loans and grants weren't considered income when the housing authority was figuring out my rent, which is $0. I also have a reduced-fee health care program, and my financial aid wasn't a factor in that, either.<br>  <br>  I don't know how food stamps work in your area, but in Wisconsin you have to be employed or "actively searching". So I didn't apply for them, because I don't want a job right now. I'm not sure if they would count your work/study income, but the easiest way to find out is to call your caseworker.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little:)
1gyzz3kxaa	Laws vary from state to state, but most schools will permit students to work on completing their high school diploma at a traditional public school for 1-3 years after they turn eighteen.   Many adults realize that finishing a high school diploma can improve their employment prospects and make them eligible for workplace promotions. However, most grown-ups don’t have the leisure of spending seven hours a day on a school campus. <br>  <br>  Online high schools offer the solution. Online high school diploma programs offer adults the chance to schedule school work at their convenience and complete courses at their own pace.

LwGGrsWHaa	For an MBA degree, it would be advisable if he works for 2-3 years in a Business Environment and then write GMAT and aim to score 700+ marks. That would give him a chance to target the best MBA courses available.    However, he can also look at doing MS in Electronics and Communications.  Here there are two factors:    - Qualifying Score in the entrance exams    - Available Finance    If he can qualify the exam to get admit to an IIT or IISC in India, then that should be the first preference.    If not, and if you have sufficient funds to finance the initial period of his Study abroad, then he should prepare for GRE and aim for a good university abroad.

b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	You're paying to live off campus when you could live in a dorm for free?  I don't understand it.  If you don't want the dorm room, give it up to some other student who'd like to have it.  Most colleges have waiting lists for dorms.    They can adjust your scholarship for that.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	Unless you're living with your family off-campus, I personally think that you should stay in the dorm, especially if it's your first year. It gives you the opportunity to met other students and make friends. You could hang in there between classes, and I'm sure if you had a roommate that he/she might appreciate, because it would be like the person having their own room. During the first weeks of school everyone on the floors are getting to know each other and the R.A. is getting to know who the students are. If you aren't there regularly they could possibly think that something has happened to you, if you're coming and going sporadically. So like the other person mentioned you might just want to notify the office of residential life (or whatever they call it at the school that you will be attending). Good Luck!

Interviewers like to know what you've experienced and how you dealt with it.    For example -     Q18 is definitely not right because you explain why you were upset with mum but it doesn't really connect with nursing. It's just a mother/ son thing about work.    As for q 20  . . .  The answer should have been - in a nursing situation, I ask my line manager/ supervisor. In a non-nursing situation I look for more information and decide from what I find out.
