He should be able to see there's something wrong with what you're being expected to pay given the billing history.  <br>  <br>  It almost sounds like you're being given the whole bill because the other tenants are flat rate, which is a mistake because there's no incentive for them to conserve and, if there is a problem with the separation, they clearly aren't making ANY effort to conserve.  If your landlord still expects you to deal with such a high bill because ofh is other tenants, you may have to consider moving.

With a Roth IRA, You will have to pay the tax up front to purchase it. This will grow and grow until retirement and you get all the money tax free at that time because you paid the taxes up front. I would seek the advice of a good financial advisor. There are many investment choices within a Roth IRA. From very conservative to wildly aggressive. The more aggressive, the more risk but the better potential returns. The more conservative, the less risk but the smaller returns over time. It is very wise that you are planning your future at such a young age. Talk to family and friends and see if they can recommend a good trusted financial advisor to you. Good luck.|`|bNdNV6vxaa	You might want to consult a financial specialist to get the best plan set forth for you.<br>  <br>  Roth IRAs are great. But you could also put that money into a bank account, let it accrue and once you get married... you can give those assets to your husband (up to a certain amount), and the IRS won't be able to tax you. This is only a once in a lifetime contribution, and there are certain stipulations to adhere by. Talk to your banker, he/she will be able to explain it better for you.<br>  <br>  You could also put that money into a CD (Certificate of Deposit), which allows your funds to mature at a specified rate for a certain period of time; however, if you with drawl those funds, you will be penalized.<br>  <br>  Either way, do some research.

nlmkQeinaa	Can you call your timeshare company and ask them how people sell their points?|`|eYFRKmPOaa	You can go back to your timeshare company, but they will more than likely tell you that you are on your own. You need to find a reputable company that does resales. Here is the problem that you will run into, Most starter packages are not worth what you paid, you need to know that you are not going to get what you put into it. Do not go to any company that charges a fee upfront, and do not agree to sign it away in advance of the closing. You can try to list it on craigslist or ebay. Another option is redweeks and tug. Lastly you can go to Timeshare Advocacy International for a list of solid resale companies that do not charge up front fees. Good luck.

PN7XMglOaa	always pay your bills on time|`|xMqgB2GDaa	It's not that simple. Credit is a measure of your habits, which take time to show. There are some things you can do to improve, the biggest of which is improve your debt to income ratio (either by paying off your debts or increasing your income), and your credit utilization should be between 20-30%. Less and they think you never use your credit, more and they think you can't afford your purchases. Realize, the utilization should be paid every month, but you have to use your credit card to establish a payment history. If you never use it, never pay it, you're not proving anything other than you don't need/use credit. For example, if you have a $500 limit, you should be charging an average of 100-150 every month, and PAYING it off every month. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, your total liability (available credit) should not be dispersed between 50 different places, rather a few longstanding accounts. Length of credit history speaks as well. Your history can go back as far as 7-12 years, with the exception of bankruptcy, which in some cases never goes away.<br>  <br>  Applying for more credit generally is a negative impact, but only slight, so it should be avoided if possible. If you close unused accounts, your debt to credit ratio is going to get way worse. <br>  <br>  Basically, there is no fast way to get it up. Only a fast way to get it down. Getting it up takes time and consistent payment of bills and debt/credit management.|`|tmh42R6Caa	Yes.  If you have a lot of cards that are up near their limit you'll lose points.  You need to have a decent amount of available credit to get you some extra points.  Also, don't close your oldest card.  Your credit rating is based on your credit history.  If you close a card that you've had for 10 years and only keep a brand new one, suddenly your "credit history" is very short.  Just keep paying down your cards as best you can and try not to hover near the limits.  Good luck!|`|C6kXIJaBaa	To raise credit score<br>  <br>  1.

fSlZQzS4aa	Your question is vague.  As a nanny, you are a household employee.  Your wages are not subject to income tax withholding unless you and your employer agree to do it but they are subject to Social Security and Medicare tax withholding.  If you employer did it right, you should file a normal return but will have no income tax withholding and will have to send a check if there is a balance due.  If your employer was trying to cheat you by not paying Social Security and Medicare tax, you should attach IRS Form 8919 to your return to report only the employee portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes.  You should ignore any posts here that say anything about self-employment or Schedule C.|`|0F8hauikaa	Read instructions for Schedule C (self-employment form) and Schedule SE (Social Security tax)  to determine the amount. You may want to pay quarterly with Form 1040-ES, where you send in an estimated amount four times a year.

If you stop paying then they will evict you for non-payment and sue you for back rent.  Their not paying their mortgage has NOTHING to do with your obligation to pay your rent.  Also, if the foreclosure has not been filed yet, then they are not legally required to tell you about it. They did nothing wrong there.  <br>  <br>  Since it is not actually foreclosed yet, then there is still a chance they will keep it or sell it before that happens.  They are probably planing on using your rent money to get caught up so they can keep the house.  All you can do at this point is wait and see what happens.  If it sells first, then your lease goes to the new owner and they are required to honor your lease.<br>  <br>  I'd look around for another place and get prepared.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Some states have passed a law saying that you can send the landlord a letter stating "unless the landlord provides you with written proof that she has the money in the bank in an amount sufficient to make-up all the back payments..... you do not have to pay any rent until your security is used up".  <br>  Everyone knows what is going to happen. The bank will own the house and kick you out (they have to do that to protect themselves), and the landlord will never give you the deposit.

If you try to submit a higher adjustment, he/she will just tell you to go to the shop where they can get the work done more cheaply.  You can still choose to go to your more expensive shop, but the adjuster will probably still only agree to pay the $900 and you'd have to pay the extra.<br>  <br>  It's obvious to the adjuster what you're trying to do.  You got an expensive estimate, you want the check ($1,200 for example) made to you instead of being paid directly to the shop so you can cash it and turn around and go get the work done for $900 and pocket the extra $300.  Regardless of how they decide to settle the claim they're not going to let that happen, you have no right to profit off of the claim, that goes against the concept of indemnification, which is the basic principle that insurance operates under.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Ask the repair shop to fax the estimate to the insurance company. Adjusters just do an initial figure (in this case $900), and once it's being fixed if there is any hidden damage, the shop usually faxes the invoice to the insurance and they pay the shop directly, minus your deductible.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing what you're asking is if you can get the check made out to you and then choose a shop (or pocket it).  I believe they can do that as well.  Just call the insurance and ask.
tvUAO4ioaa	We rented a house on the Jersey Shore (Wildwood) and our contract said that no one (except for minor children with parents present) would be under the age of 25.|`|23SkYEw5aa	I wouldn't rent to anyone that is 18.  <br>  <br>  MOST beach houses rent to families only.  And usually to people over 25.  <br>  <br>  But, you can't hurt to ask.|`|8Raw4M1naa	Credit is also something renters look at, and if you're young with bad credit, there is almost zero chance of you guys being able to rent.<br>  <br>  Many people have qualms about renting to people exactly 18 because they feel as though they just want to get out from under their parents rules and party. For this reason, most people tend to trash the house they are renting, or turn it into a party home, and no renter wants that.<br>  <br>  Your best bet may to have a co-signer on the lease thats much older than 18.

y2SX4gMfaa	In my opinion, the cable companies (and most utilities) are corrupt and need to have federal oversight.  Their disregard for their customers is shameful and full of greed.  With most of our favorite shows coming out quickly on DVD, or even able to be watched on the channel's website for free, we as consumers should ban together and boycot these companies until they realize that it's us, the consumer, that pays them their paycheck.  The CEO's make millions off of our sweat.  Let them try cutting the pay of their top executives and minimize lavish expenses such as corporate jets instead of raping our wallets.|`|AA11305474	My cable company raised its rates at the end of last year by $10 a month.  I was outraged because I think they were over priced to start with.  Plus, there is a lot of competition in our area with the dish, but they only offer teaser rates that last for 3 months and then kick up more than what cable costs.  No win situation.|`|x1EqOYoqaa	They don't "want" more money, they require it.  This little phenomenon is called Inflation.  Prices increase every year not just for us as individuals, but for businesses too.  A company like Rogers doesn't just increase their prices because they are greedy, its because they are trying to increase their profits, or at least maintain a steady level of profits during these harsh economic times.<br>  You might think that cable is a necessity, and not a luxury.  However, people getting laid off may end up cancelling or downgrading their cable options...and less people are creating new cable accounts with Rogers because they cannot afford it.<br>  Would you want to run your business by decreasing your profits and giving money away?  Not likely...

Maoj7HYSaa	Pink Slip is an idiom for losing one's job. Workers used to get a pink slip at the end of the day informing them of the decision. Laid off more specifically refers to losing your job through no fault of your own. Fired typically means you did something wrong and were let go because of it. Pink slip can refer to being laid off or fired.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	When people got fired they got a pink slip. The term stayed. Now the pink slip means your fired because you did something wrong according to the company. Laid off means there's a lack of work and can not financially keep you.

Rent it out until the market picks up if possible. Use three agents. If Connells object in any way, offer to take the house off their books. They will soon get the message. Three agents will work much harder to get a good deal as competition is present. You've got to be tough and decisive with house sales. Too much to lose if you don't keep on top of it. You also find that some firms are vastly better at it. It's just a matter of research to discover them. Don't listen to rumour. You have to find out for yourself.

aijIGqAeaa	I'm not an Avon rep and I'm not in the UK,  but since no one else has answered I'll try to help you out a bit. I do know a little bit about choosing and joining a direct sales company.<br>  <br>  Avon is one of the least expensive companies to join. In the US it's often just $10 so I would think the UK's sign up fee is similar. With any business there will be ongoing costs. For a direct sales company those costs may include catalogs and business forms, the company provided website, and marketing and advertising costs. There may also be an annual renewal fee to the company.<br>  <br>  Many (most?) direct sales companies don't allow their products to be sold through online auctions and many don't allow you to sell products from a website other than the one provided by the company.<br>  <br>  You should visit the Avon website and contact them with your questions. They may also put you in touch with a consultant.

There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for paying your car and mortgage.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal.

TQVMAZUbaa	A bond represents a loan from the buyer to the issuer.  In the case of Treasury Bonds, they are issued by the US Federal Government (the borrower) and will pay a stated rate of interest every year (twice-yearly payments) until they mature.  Upon maturity, the owner of the bond ((the lender) gets their full principal back.<br>  <br>  The reason why some are so concerned with China's level of ownership of US Treasury Bonds is that if they decide to sell them quickly, the price of the bonds could drop rapidly and result in increasing interest rates in the US.  It could also conceivably lead to a decline in the value of the US dollar compared to other currencies.  <br>  <br>  (The relationship between bond prices, interest rates, and currency values is for another question.)|`|AA11173563	IOU is what a bond is in legal jargon that bears interest that must be paid|`|2OoSK35xaa	Basically it is an investment in the government.

Local builders are filing bankruptcy because they have already built more houses that are standing empty or are taking a loss just to get them off their books. So, right now, forget Florida as a place to build houses. One out of every five houses is in foreclosure there. Banks are letting houses go for less than half what they sold for a couple years ago. My niece bought a house in Nov. 2006 for $237,000. She left the house in Jan. 2008 and because she could no longer afford the almost $2000 a month it was costing her. It is currently on the market for $119,000, which was just reduced from $125,900. <br>  <br>  Florida is the last place you want to build homes right now.

Find out if your state requires bail bond agents to be licensed, find out if they need to be insured and how you can go about obtaining insurance for that occupation. In most states it is the department of insurance. To offer auto insurance you likely need an insurance license, etc. While these are all very valuable services, you may want to hone your skills in just one of these fields before expanding to offer more.|`|tQKet4hhaa	I'm totally sure about starting a Hispanic Group company... but I have worked with many people that have started online businesses.

izLEVnKIaa	Gold is currently going up due to its status as a "safe haven". It should be pointed out however that the usual demographic of gold is 80% jewellery, 5% industry and 15% investors. In the past year that has changed dramatically with now just 60% jewellery, 5% industry and 35% investors - mainly in ETF's (1400 tonnes now). This is why gold has broken away from its usual correlations as it is driven by investor sentiment rather than industry or major central banks or institutional investors. <br>  <br>  Commodities are dropping in value due to lack of demand due to the recession, gold is increasing in value because people are worried because of the recession|`|RL1C9hVPaa	Most all commodities are used to make things. Gold is an exception as it really isn't used all that much in building anything at all. So although it is lumped with commodities, its demand is different from the rest of them.<br>  <br>  The best way to think of how gold trades is as a hedge against inflation and the US Dollar.<br>  Generally (and until very recently) if the dollar is weak, gold is strong;  if the dollar is strong, gold is weak. Right now the two are holding hands on the way up, but now is an exceptional time as both the are seen as safe havens for worldwide wealth at the moment. However, one will have to give way, and it most likely will be the dollar as the FED is promoting inflation by printing out more money and the economy is showing no signs of recovery. Oil also tracks closely with the dollar much the same way.<br>  <br>  So, it's best not to think of gold as a commodity, but as a hedge against inflation and the US dollar.

If you like that stress then you aren't ready for the change!<br>  <br>  We have been using Dave's plan for 3 years, some months are harder than others but we keep going. I am the nerd and I keep track of how much we have paid off and sometimes I show my husband (free spirit) because he looks at what we still have to pay off and gets discouraged and wants to throw in the towel. That is when I come in and see look where we have come! In the 3 years, we have paid cash for grad school, had baby number 2 and now getting ready for a job change. We are in the stopping the debt snowball and saving up money for the emergency on the horizon. My husband won't have a job at the end of his contract (June). So we are packing away money so if he doesn't have a contract that starts July 1st we will be ready. <br>  <br>  You can do it, keep being sick of being broke and forge ahead!|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Jen,<br>  My wife and I are also on Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover. We have been on it for only a few months and it is hard to change all of our "old habits" at once. I know, I feel your pain. About the only thing I can tell you is from personal experience. I just got the title for our last car in the mail last week. No more car payments. WAHOO!!!! We now own both of our cars almost 1 year early. This frees up about $800 a month for our other debts. What a great feeling. All I can say is to stick with it. If you fall off, get right back on. You can't ride off into the sunset gloriously until you first learn to ride the horse. And, you will always fall of the horse a couple of times when you are learning to ride. Keep at it. You are doing yourself the biggest favor possible. Maybe to get back on the horse, if you are moving in about 4 months, why not have a moving sale? The benefits are twofold. 1. You can make a little extra cash and 2. It is less stuff you have to move. Just a thought.<br>  Anyway, I applaud you for your efforts. I know it is very difficult. The rewards will be worth it. Remember what Dave's favorite word to others and yourself should be?  "NO"!!!<br>   Keep at it and good luck. I wish you success.
Gun3UGzaaa	I am assuming you did have an unpaid bill with Capital One.  If that is true, then you basically have two options.  Pay what you owed, which will then require them to change the status of the account.  Or two, wait until 7 years after the chargeoff and then it will drop off.  <br>  <br>  If you write to Capital One, mention the phrase "fair credit reporting act" and tell them you want the bill reported on your credit report investigated.   Send it certified mail, return receipt requested.  They will have to respond within 30 days.  If they do not, you can then write to Equifax and tell them to remove the entry because Capital One did not respond within 30 days.  <br>  <br>  If capital one does respond, then you will have more information to figure out what is going on.
9FxR4khCaa	If it is truly an emergency, hospitals may not refuse treatment. If you are seen in a private hospital, that hospital may either do the surgery or if not immediately necessary, transfer you to a county run hospital for treatment (surgery) if the county hospital has a bed. The private hospital may have assistance programs that you can apply for provided you don't qualify for medicaid in your state. The county hospital will have a similar assistance program-a sliding fee scale based on you ability to pay.|`|9k4d7Kytaa	Well, if it's truly an emergency, an ER is not allowed to turn you away for lack of insurance, they have to at least stabilize you...then they can kick you to the curb and bill you for their services.  They have no obligation to waive the charges for you.<br>  <br>  If this person is unemployed, there's a good chance they may qualify for Medicaid, so have them visit their state's Department of Economic Services and apply for Medicaid.  In some states, Medicaid may even pay for treatment that was received the prior month.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	In a perfect world, I don't think a hospital emergency room can turn you away.  Doctors are bound by oath to administer aid.  You may get bills, but if you have no money to pay them, you can't. Maybe social services can help with free clinics and such.  I'm sure those are overloaded right now too because of the current economic downturn.  But more and more people are going to emergency rooms now because they can't afford doctors.

Talk with a lawyer that understand this issue.|`|qBCGH52haa	Medicare itself makes only very limited Nursing home payments and my guess is that your grandmother will have to qualify for financial help under Medicaid.  In 2006, the look back period for asset transfer was changed to 5 years, meaning that if any major assets (1/2 the farm for example) was transferred or sold to another, the time to qualify for nursing home payment was extended.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest seeing an attorney who specializes in Medicaid.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I'm not sure what you're talking about.  The nursing home could put a lien on the property to ensure payment, but then maybe not.  You make it sound like they're already trying to take it or you're planning on not paying for her care and want to protect your inheritance.  We need a few more details.|`|d07683f385c8c5d34bcf9ca4a532395faa	If she's not in the nursing home right now get to an attorney and just transfer her 1/2 to yourself if that's the way gram wants it.|`|nlmkQeinaa	I think there's a time limit. Like it might had to be in your name for 2 years. I could be wrong, but thought I heard that somewhere.|`|U12Xuyemaa	It depends on your state and financial circumstances. Most states have a look-back period of 3-7 years to see if any thing of value was transferred out of the residents name into the name of someone else. If the state is paying for her care (Medicaid) then they will probably make you pay for that half of the farm -or- they will deny paying for services until the value of the real estate is "spent-down".There situations where if you lived with her on the property and took care of her for so many years before placing her in nursing care the farm could be exempt. You probably need to consult with an attorney to see if there is any way around this. The nursing home its self would probably not have any claim on her property unless she has an unpaid bill there.

The FTC also reported that it received 161,800 complaints of identity theft - up 88 percent from 86,200 the year before. Many believe that this is just a small fraction of the total number of victims. In 2002, Star Systems conducted a telephone survey that they believe indicates that as many as one in 20 adults, or 11.8 million Americans, have been victims of identity theft.<br>  <br>  According to a May 2000 survey by CalPIRG and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, the average consumer victim spends 175 hours and $800 resolving identity theft problems, and it takes two to four years for victims to clear up all the resulting problems. The sooner you take action to clear your records, the better. That's why it's important to order your credit reports regularly, at least once a year. <br>  <br>  There's several good resources for folks trying to undo or correct problems caused by identity thieves...try the following site from the Federal Trade Commission:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/id...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!

Though you work 80 hours in 2 weeks, bi-monthly paychecks actually cover more than two weeks.  Look at it like this:  A person who is paid bi-monthly, gets 24 paychecks per year (2 per month).  However, those who get paid every two weeks, get 26 paychecks per year.  So, in reality, your bi-monthly paycheck should cover 86.66 hours (assuming you work 40 hours/week).|`|zuGKIWfNaa	If you work Monday through Friday, 8 hours per day, yes.

If you are, then it would be a lot easier and cheaper to manage it by yourself.<br>  You have to pay the mortgage, utilities (if each unit has their own utility meters, good, but you still have electric and gas for "common" utilities e.g. washer, drier, hallway and outdoor lights, trash pick-up, water and sewer etc.), any repairs that come up; taxes and insurance should be wrapped up into your mortgage. You have to have savings in case you have to evict someone (court costs, non-paid rent) and/or you can't transition smoothly between tenants and you have a empty unit for a while.<br>  I recently purchase a 4-plex and moved in, and moved in one unit. I am not living "rent-free', but "discounted" (but I put a lot of work hours into the property). I manage my own properties (I been a landlord for almost 20 years and have 8 rental units at this time), and I think property management companies charge between 10 and 20 % of the rental income. Also, when I purchased I specifically told that if I had experience as a landlord, I would not have been approved for the loan,because the mortgage companies are really scared right now and they make everyone jump thought a extra 100 hoops to get approved. Not that I am trying to discourage you, but you should chat with a property management agency and a mortgage company and see what they say. Good luck!

iuhs7Zjcaa	That is where the bankers incompetence comes in.  Due to some rule changes they were able to take what they received, and leverage out the money, ie, get payment for mortgage from Joe Blow, and loan or invest it up to hundreds of times.  Like someone borrowing repeatedly using the same collateral.  In the meantime, the money was paid out to investors, employees, etc.  Also, similar to kiting a check in the old days.  In the old days, people who needed money before payday, had up to a week of mail time, you know, before electronic money.  So they wrote the check, knowing it would not get mailed or taken to the bank for two or three days, so they would write another check to cover the first amount and deposit in the bank to cover the original check.  Then pay day would happen and they would have to pay for the full amount to be caught up.  Problem is, if somewhere down the line they didn't get paid, then all of it collapses, like our economy is doing now.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	If you find out, could you copy me in on the info please
3Li6uaiEaa	First of all, you have to be very careful how title was taken when you purchased the property with your brother and whose name or names are on the loan (if any).  I'm not sure what you mean by splitting the property since you are both, in all liklihood, 50% owners.  <br>  <br>  Even though you are upside down as long as you have two tenants paying rent and you can cover your loan payments and keep up with the duplex, you should hold onto it given the horrific down cycle we are currently in.  Regardless of how much "upside down" you are, call your lender and see if you can apply for a loan modification.  There are numerous factors involved in granting a loan modification so if you are denied, request in writing the reasons. You might also discuss the possibility of a "short sale" with the lender so you both can get out from under the property.  There are again a lot of variables involved with this.  <br>  <br>  Check with the realtor that sold you the duplex for his/her opinion.  If that is not an option, research your local real estate companies and talk with an experienced agent who can better evaluate your situation and provide some guidance.|`|MuXcs6FTaa	One thing you probably need to learn here, is anytime you enter into a partnership (as you did with your brother) you need a clear partnership agreement that address situations such as this.<br>  <br>  It appears you will have to decide to keep the property and wait for a turn around. Or sell it and move on.|`|AA11173563	the problem is it is not zoned as a town house it is a duplex. You either sell it or keep it and rent it out|`|EXJfoGtAaa	What good would splitting do?  You'd still be underwater.  Plus the mortgage is on the entire property so even if you split the property you can't split the mortgage.  If you split the property and one side is sold, you would have to pay off the entire mortgage.  Also, if you were to split the property you're looking at legal expenses.  You would be creating a 2 unit condominium and that involves filing documents with the state.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

You have to be able to show the bank that you have the income to repay the loan payments.

Hypertension's code is 401.9.  This goes on the claim form.  All diagnosis' have numeric codes.  This keeps everything uniform and makes it much easier.  Medical coding and billing is actually kindof fun if you like looking stuff up and reading pt charts.  The income all depends on the certification that you get.  If you are not certified the income is not that good.  Hope this helps.|`|ggWxeCB3aa	In the medical field, every medical condition (diagnosis) and every medical procedure is assigned a unique numeric code. These are known as ICD (for diagnoses) and CPT (for procedures) codes. Health care providers and insurers use these codes for reimbursement.<br>  <br>  According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, "Some medical records and health information technicians specialize in coding patients’ medical information for insurance purposes. Technicians who specialize in coding are called health information coders, medical record coders, coder/abstractors, or coding specialists. These technicians assign a code to each diagnosis and procedure, relying on their knowledge of disease processes. Technicians then use classification systems software to assign the patient to one of several hundred “diagnosis-related groups,” or DRGs. The DRG determines the amount for which the hospital will be reimbursed if the patient is covered by Medicare or other insurance programs using the DRG system. In addition to the DRG system, coders use other coding systems, such as those required for ambulatory settings, physician offices, or long-term care."<br>  <br>  Here's what the Occupational Outlook Handbook says about income:  "Median annual earnings of medical records and health information technicians were $28,030 in May 2006. The middle 50 percent earned between $22,420 and $35,990. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $19,060, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $45,260."<br>  <br>  You can read the entire entry here:  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos103.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos103.htm</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Cyndy<br>  <a href="http://www.theaccidentalmedicalwriter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaccidentalmedicalwriter.co...</a>

Have fun raising funds!<br>  <br>  I have used this before to help a friend of mine raise money for her local Autism Group.<br>  <br>  I am an Arbonne Independent Consultant.  Arbonne is a Green Company offering Pure, Safe, and Beneficial Health and Beauty Products. Arbonne has these 6 great lip glosses that cost $10.00 US Retail. I also include Arbonne Lip Saver for the guys and the gals. (SPF8 Chap stick). Priced at $8.00 US. <br>  <br>  This makes the fund raiser fun and simple. Just 7 products and each sold earn $3 for the fundraising cause. I also work into the program rewards for each of the sellers if they reach certain sales goals. <br>  <br>  Where do you live? Arbonne can be sold out of the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. So this should work for any of these locations or if you live another place, I just need to look at the shipping cost of the products.<br>  <br>  Anyway it is very fun and really can create a nice amount of money for the cause.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Sell 30 and earn $90.00<br>  ($3.00 earned for each sold)<br>  <br>  Plus each time you can sell 30 you will get $50.00 in Arbonne Product Free as a bonus.

In addition, the settlement will require him to fund your escrow account with the taxes for Jan - Mar.  <br>  <br>  If your State has you paying taxes in advance, then the April payment will be for this year.

If the meat goes off and you have to throw it away then you will have written off your investment and your comapny will be worth $0. <br>  <br>  In the case of banks, this means that they have less capital on their balance sheet. As banks have to have minimum capital reserves according to the Basle II convention this means that they will have less money to invest, giving less profit, less shareholder wealth and lower share prices (unless the market believes that the bank is in a stronger position after the write off and then the shares will go up).|`|EUVr6uNVaa	Reducing the book value of an asset to reflect a fall in its market value.

In fact, the company will report the job offer to the unemployment department and the fact that you refused it if you don't take it and THAT could cause you to lose any further benefits unless you have good reason to refuse the work.

I always find that amazing.  Then when you file your income tax return next year you will have to include this interest as income.  The IRS will send you a form next year reminding you.  <br>  <br>  So as long as everything was included with the 1040X forms and the IRS approves the change to your tax returns you should receive the full amount plus interest.

I can't for the life of me figure out any way that you'd get a larger refund on a 1040-EZ vs a 1040-A or standard 1040.  I can see it working the other way around, but not the way that you are asking.  Exactly what is giving you more money??  BTW, you amend a tax return, not the form itself.<br>  <br>  If you are actually due a refund it's NOT due to "amending" to a 1040-EZ but some error that you made on whatever form you did file.  There is never a penalty when you are due a refund though.<br>  <br>  Post more details about how you figure that this resulted in more money for you and we can have a look at it, but what you are claiming just does NOT make any sense at all.

He (or she) will search the multiple listing service (MLS) for you based on what you can afford and your desired criteria (location, size of house, number of bed/baths, etc.). The agent will show houses to you and help you find the perfect place. And, still you are under no obligation to anyone.<br>  <br>  If you find a place that you want to buy, your agent will draw up the offer for you, including a bunch of pre-conditions called contingencies that must be met before your offer is considered valid (like the property must pass a housing inspection, or you get to back out of the deal with no penalty).<br>  <br>  If you don't like any of the places and decide that you can't afford the kind of house you would like to live in, you just tell the agent thank you for your time, but you're going to continue renting right now. In the mean time, they can still send you listings of houses they think you might be interested in. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that it might take several months to find that perfect house to buy. It might take only a week or so. Or, you may never find that perfect house. But, your agent will keep working to find a place for you in the hopes that you do eventually buy something, and they get their commission.

I would continue to pay or he could get you evicted or take you to small claims court for unpaid rents.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Until the moment that the county takes over possession of the property through foreclosure, the current owner of the property is your landlord and you must continue making payments to him/her. If the foreclosure does go through, the bank will give you a 30-day notice that the property is going to foreclosure auction, which is basically your 30-day notice to vacate the premises.<br>  <br>  Right now, foreclosures are being delayed for a couple of reasons: First, there are so many that the banks are having difficulty keeping up with all of them. Second, a lot of lenders are waiting to find out exactly how the current administration is going to bail out foreclosure homeowners. So, it's likely that the house won't go into foreclosure for some time, perhaps until after July. <br>  <br>  When your lease expires in July, you will automatically revert to a month-to-month lease. At that time, you just have to give a 30-day notice to vacate. If I were you, I would keep my eye on available rentals in case the foreclosure comes through. Then, if you last through when your lease is up, you can look for other rentals and move at your leisure (with a 30-day notice).|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Your fine.

Keep paying your rent and living there until you get legal notice that you can't live there anymore.  The landlord's problems don't change your lease until they stop him from keeping his end of the lease.  And the realtor is probably right that the owner can deal with this, and if it turns out that he can't, the bank or next owner may also want to rent to you.
O8qdCBzLaa	Contact and retain a buyer's agent (this is paid for by the seller, in this case a bank or lender). They can do a quick review of comps to see what similar homes have been selling for to help you settle on an offer price. Also, they will have access to the MLS system and other confidential links that tell how much was owed on the property when it was foreclosed on (including any liens). You can then deduct the amount that it would likely cost to fix the place up nice. This will further give you a good idea of how much the bank is likely to accept.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that foreclosures are usually listed at a price to sell, which is already significantly below market value. And, the seller may not entertain such ridiculously low offers. Also, there are a lot of people out there looking to buy foreclosures as investments. And, many of these investors are consortiums with lots of cash to put down cash offers. <br>  <br>  When I was looking at foreclosures last year, I put offers in on 6 properties over a few months. At first, I put in low-ball offers (about 10% less than the listing price) and got aced out. Even when I put in offers about 5% above the listing price, someone else swooped in and took it. In some cases, these were lower cash offers that the banks prefer (there's no way the deal falls out of escrow for lack of financing). And, a couple of them ended up in bidding wars that eventually sold for about 10% over the listing price.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	Ask your Realtor.|`|brOOXQfYaa	It depends.

From what your saying you don't have an account at all so you are SOL. Your best bet is to open an account and just have the bank hold the funds if you don't want to pay a bunch at a check cashing place.  Ask the bank if they can call and verify the funds immediately or withing 2-3 days then they can release the hold.  Some banks wont do that tho.

2N6oTOLQaa	Any version of a 1099 form is a form used to report income of some form to the IRS for income tax purposes. <br>  <br>  The IRS considers canceled debt as being income to you, so they require creditors to sub mitt a 1099C when they cancel your credit card debt without you actually paying it. If this happens, there is nothing to fight. The law is black and white and your only option is to include the value of the canceled debt on your income tax return and pay the appropriate taxes. <br>  <br>  The only way the credit card company can issue you a 1099 legally is if they cancel the debt and stop trying to collect on it. So if they do send you a 1099 but they keep calling you, then you'd have something to fight them on. <br>  <br>  The 1099 for the canceled debt counts as income in the year that the debt is canceled. So if they cancel the debt now and send you a 1099C, you would include it on your 2009 tax return, not on the 2008 return that you are filling now. <br>  <br>  Don't let them push you around with threats of a 1099. They are assuming that you don't know what impact it will have on your taxes, and therefore you will be scared into paying the debt. If they send you a 1099 for $800 because they canceled an $800 debt, then it means your taxable income for 2009 will be $800 more. Multiply that by your tax bracket and you get the amount of extra income taxes you'll have to pay. For example if you are in the 15% tax bracket, this would increase your tax liability for 2009 by just $120 (15% of $800). If you usually get a tax refund anyway, then it just means your tax refund would be $120 smaller next year. <br>  <br>  Letting them send you a 1099 and cancel the debt is actually your cheapest option at this point. It would be better for your credit score to pay it off and some people might lecuture you on the moral aspect of not paying your debts, but I won't go there. If I were in your shoes I'd tell this company that I didn't have the money so they might as well send me the 1099. <br>  <br>  I Hope this was helpful.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Gee, if you can't pay, you want to quibble that the lender cancels the debt and is legally obligated to issue the form 1099-C?<br>  <br>  The tax on $800 is less than actually paying $800.|`|AA10469473	Either you pay the bill, or if it's cancelled then the amount is taxable income to you.  A 1099C is just a form for cancellation of debt.  You fight it by paying what you owe, or by paying part and then talking them into an extension to pay.
J73cJDZeaa	There isn't a 30th of Feb - might be your reason.<br>  <br>  There will be a penalty if you pay it late - I would call your credit card and ask. Usually it's every 30 days soo the dates may have adjusted and became earlier because of those months with 31 days in it.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	Some credit cards are on a 30 day cycle instead of a particular day schedule.  That will make the due date float a bit.  They do this because it's easy to program in a computer.  It also makes it easier for a person to miss the due date and incur fees.  I'm not sure if this is an intended side effect, but I have canceled cards for this very reason.|`|AA11558572	Payments are probably due every 30 days and because each Month has a different amount of days, the actual day can change month to month.|`|HBV9GGXDaa	The CC Companies and banks are clamoring for cash right now due to the large number of people walking away from debts owed to banks and credit card companies.  <br>  <br>  Amex has offered folks $300 for paying there balances.  <br>  <br>  The date has been moved up for the expressed reason of getting more cash into the banks and CC companies faster.  Yes, you will get a penalty for the late payment if you pay on the old schedule.<br>  <br>  The limits have be decreased as well, so make sure you are not over a new lower limit that you might not have noticed.  You will now get a penalty for that as well.|`|GJLjNk5Waa	With the economy like it is, they are probably doing anything they can to make an extra buck...late charges.

Big mistake.<br>  <br>  If you have not agreed to pay, then (1) ask AFNI who the original creditor was, (2) ask your wife whether she ever owed money to whomever AFNI says was the original creditor, (3) ask whomever AFNI says was the original creditor whether they use AFNI to collect debts and/or sold the debt to AFNI.|`|5BTKscZraa	When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  <br>  Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt (do not use regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt, including a copy of the original signed application with my signature<br>  <br>  Receipt of the letter is being time stamped by the USPS. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector.

mwkfirjRaa	On September 30, 1999, the New York Times reported that the Fannie Mae Corporation was easing credit requirements on loans that it purchases from banks and other lenders.<br>  <br>  The pressure was primarily from three sources.  Banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies were pressuring Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to sub-prime borrowers.  The banks and other financial institutions made their money on fees for originating and selling these loans.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, stock holders, looking for higher yields, were pressuring Fannie Mae to expand its lending to a broader income group to increase its phenomenal profits.<br>  <br>  And, the Clinton Administration wanted to expand mortgage loans among low-to-moderate income households.<br>  <br>  The opportunists used the call to expand home ownership rates among minorities and lower income households as justification to open the floodgates on mortgage lending.  Even though community development banks had an excellent track record of making mortgage loans to disadvantaged groups, there was no such motive among the lenders selling their bad loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  They did not care if the loans were paid back because all the risk was passed along to the investors and ultimately the taxpayers.  All they cared about was maximizing profits and collecting their fees.<br>  <br>  The banks were not pressured - they were doing the pressuring.  They merely used the call to expand home ownership as a cover for their irresponsible lending practices.<br>  <br>  You may hear that the Community Reinvestment Act had something to do with this lending crisis, and that really isn't true.  96% of the subprime lenders were not subject to CRA because they were private companies.  Of the few subprime lenders that were covered under CRA, they all had a much better repayment record.<br>  <br>  By the way, the previous answer is incorrect regarding Bill Clinton signing the Community Reinvestment Act.  Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and took office in 1993.  The Community Reinvestment Act took effect in 1977.|`|eca07da7a61ec9c9479aefa456ed69d7aa	Ok, so the CRA was signed by Jimma Cata and the rules for lending were relaxed by Clinton.<br>  Early in the Bush administration there was talk of tightening mortgage lending by Fannie and Freddie but who said there was no problem with the loans?<br>  Barney Frank and Chris Dodd both of whom benefitted from the lax lending policies.|`|AA11173563	there were sub prime notes for years and years. BUt with that said it was Mr. Clinton who signed the community reinvestment act that made Fannie and Freddie become lax in prime loans to these types of borrowers thus creating the hybrid mortgages like pick a payment loans and interest only notes. It takes some time for these notes to recast and when they did the owners could not pay as they had agreed to in the terms.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	I concur with Gollfer
AA10469473	You heard wrong about the $13K limit.  For a single person who is not a dependent, the floor to have to pay taxes is $8950 - for a dependent it's $5450.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	No.  It's not true.  For 2008, the amount that is tax free for a single person with no deductions or dependents was $8950 if no one else is eligible to claim you as their dependent or $5450 if someone else is eligible to claim you as their dependent.

With your three ccs, you have $4500 in available credit. Once you pay off your two smaller balances, your ratio will be 66%. Meaning, you're borrowing 66% of your possible total. That's a bit high, but I'll get to that later. If you were to pay off your smaller cards and then close them, all you have left is you $3000 card and you're already borrowing $2900 of that - making your ratio 96%. That makes you look like a HUGE credit risk. Even if you don't want to use the other cards often, at least keep them open to help your ratios. <br>  An ideal debt ratio is 40% or less - both on individual lines of credit and with your entire line of revolving credit as well. <br>  <br>  2- Shortening the length of your credit history. Once you have a year under your belt, go ahead and keep the accounts open. If your $3000 card is the newest one, then you're damaging your credit picture as 15% of your score is calculated on the length of your credit history. The longer the history of on-time payments the better. <br>  <br>  If you want to reduce your levels of available credit, ask your creditor grantors to lower your limits...but don't close your cards. <br>  While those are only two reasons, they are good ones to consider. <br>  Good luck!|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Not much if they are closed with the balance paid and you have a good track record of paying on time. Pay them off and close the accounts. Once those are out of your life, attack the last one with a vengeance. I am a huge proponent of not using credit cards. Once you pay them off and they are out of your life, you won't have monthly payments. That can be a lot of cash you save every month. Now, when you need something, just pay cash for it. Or, you can put money in a checking account and use your debit card.|`|ujD2Huh0aa	you should NEVER EVER close a credit card, when you close credit cards it just shows the credit reporting agency you have that much less credit  to be used and can go against you debt/income ratio, it really can hurt you and go against you,  this is why banks close credit cards because of deliquency its not suppose to be an exciting event its just as bad as you closing it yourself, I suggest this unless you absolutly hate the card and they charge insurance on it monthly or chrage an annual fee, really dont close it, but its important to keep an eye on it every now and then even if you have it paid off and not charging simply because of annual fees, insurance's and fraud no one informed you about previsouly.

I haven't the slightest idea as to why you would want to file a chapter 13 though.<br>  <br>  If the house you lived in did not sell at the sheriff's auction, then the bank will own it after all the legal documents are signed with the county recorder's office.<br>  <br>  If the Sheriff is attempting to sell your house then it has been through and completed the foreclosure process.<br>  <br>  Most lenders that foreclose on a property use the non-judicial foreclosure procedure therefore there is no right of redemption for the homeowner. Under this procedure you would have received a notice stating that you were being foreclosed on.<br>  <br>  The right of redemption is allowed if the lender decide to use the judicial foreclosure procedure. That is your right. If the lender use the judicial foreclosure procedure they can also pursue you for a deficiency judgment. If the lender used this procedure you would have received a summons from a court stating that you must appear in a certain court. Most lenders do not use this procedure however.<br>   <br>  So check and see if you got a summon to a court or if you were notified that you were being foreclosed on<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"
W3wMtucgaa	If you can handle it, go for the medical assisting job - it seems quite vital that you make ends meet to help support your family so I say...go for it! At the same time, apply for the RN program (if you hadn't already done so). This way, you're doing something instead of just waiting. Nursing is a great profession, since there are so many different fields you can cover (i.e. pediatrics, geriatrics, ICU, neonatal, etc.). Good luck, and congrats on the baby!|`|Sozc3MyFaa	I can tell you that the MA program will cost you money for tuition and the likelihood of getting a MA job will be small due to over saturation & your lack of experience.  The pay is entry & probably would not cover the child care costs. To become a CNA is cheaper & faster (much much faster) and there are more jobs for this, you will gain some nursing experience and the pay is pretty much the same as a MA.  You should do your own research however.

If you have a stock you like, go to their web site and see if they have a direct purchase plan or DRIP plan.  DRIP means dividend reinvestment plan but many of those plans also let you buy shares direct from the company in limited quantities.  This is a laborious way to buy stocks.  Opening a discount brokerage account or mutual fund account is easy and trading is cheap.   I would highly encourage using mutual funds for regular purchases as they offer low cost diversification and management.  Call T Rowe Price, Fidelity or Vanguard to find out more about using funds.|`|OaFuZ5Xkaa	You can use Zecco (offers free trades) or Interactivebrokers (buy stocks for $1).

These jobs are often labeled as work at home data entry jobs, but ask you to spam forums with unwanted ads. This is a shady business and is not a long-term, legitimate data entry job.  <br>  <br>  Consider bid sites like GetAFreelancer.com. Some of these sites have sections for Data Entry jobs. Basically, you bid on a job with a price. If you are selected, you complete the work and get paid your bid. <br>  <br>  Search normal job sites like Monster.com.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	"Produce the note" does NOT get your a free house.  It's a delaying tactic. You have a right to see the mortgage note the bank held that you signed (agreeing to the mortgage) and you can use that to delay a foreclosure.  The court usually will agree that the bank has to show the note (to prove you did agree to the mortgage you now cannot pay) but many notes are bundles and sold to other mortgage companies.  It'll give you time to get enough money to get out of foreclosure.  But it won't get you a free house.  Supposedly it works most of the time and if you are determined enough, can forestall having your home taken from you IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY NEEDED TO START PAYING THE MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AGAIN.  If you already know you aren't going to ever be able to pay, good luck.  It won't be instantaneous, you have to file papers and wait for a court hearing and all that which will drag it all out (giving you time).  And in the meantime you may have had to turn off utilities and other services to save money.  I have a feeling the banks already have their lawyers working on some legal way around this though os it probably has a limited lifetime.

STYhiMEyaa	Be very, very careful.  Anyone approaching you and asking for your buy-in has spotted that you're doing all right with your existing business and probably sees you as a ticket to improving their business.<br>  <br>  As others have said, check the books thoroughly.  Ask your accountant to go through them thoroughly.<br>  <br>  Questions the reasons that the person wants you to buy in.  If they have a business that has good finances, why would they want to give half of it away to someone else?<br>  <br>  If you do decide to go for it, have a legally binding agreement drawn up with a solicitor that sets out exactly what you're taking on and what you're liable for.  We took on an outside director in one of our businesses to help with the work load.  He has not performed as promised and we're not trying to untangle the relationship.  We did draw up an agreement at the start, which helps, and, being a limited company, there are some guidelines to follow.  Partnerships are always harder, especially if there's not an agreement.<br>  <br>  As a business owner, I'd stick with the business you already have and develop it the way you'd like to see it go.  Maybe you could set up a strategic alliance with the computer shop, where you agree to refer customers between you.  That way, you could both win.<br>  <br>  Good luck but tread carefully!|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Make sure the books you see are the correct ones and not ones made up just for the sale.

1NK1hK1Taa	If you just want to use eBay, why not see about getting a Paypal account? You can link it up with your bank account. It would also mean you wouldn't have to keep giving out your card number. Paypal is a third party. You don't get to see the seller's banking details, and the seller doesn't get to see yours. Plus, with Paypal, you get peace of mind that you would get with a debit card. You get protection for your payment. If the seller turns out to be describing one thing, but selling something that is crap, you can get your money back like with a credit card, but without the interest every six weeks...|`|1e13f176409d9abf282c67b473f007fbaa	Most of the Ebay sellers use Paypal.<br>  Another option would be send the seller a check.

Check their terms of service.<br>  <br>  IF you pass the age requirement, you can allow Paypal to debit your checking account directly as would the debit card.

Say you offered $500K on a house with a first loan of $550K and a second of $50K. The first lender will get a good portion of their investment back....in comparison to the second lender. Second lender will get nothing. There is no advantage for the second lender to agree to accept nothing. The second lender could actually foreclose, take the house back by paying off the first, and then sell it.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you keep shopping and find another house to pursue. Without lender approval (both lenders) you should be under no obligation to wait around. If it works out later on and you haven't found another property, then pursue it.

The patients are very very sick and complex, I also have 5 or 6 on day shift!|`|dPwdiwHNaa	Well there you go, it already sounds like you would have the drive and passion to a be nurse if you wanted to. Being a nurse takes someone who is strong (mentally and emotionally), ready to take on hard work and multiple tasks, think critically, but at the same time have compassion for his/her patients. I'm also thinking of getting a BSN. I think you should definitely go for it. You said you already have a bachelors, so even if you took some classes (which could show you what nursing is like), and decided it was not for you, you always have that to fall back on.

My suggestion to you is to volunteer at a hospital of your choice.  Most hospitals only require 4 hours a week minimum and 100 hours per year. Besides being able to decide what you like and don't like, volunteering looks good on a resume.  It's the alternative choice to going to school and it's hands on.  Most hospitals go to their volunteers first before posting openings to the public.  You might discover that the medical field is not for you or be able to specialize.

Only loss prevention associates are allowed to deal with shoplifters, and even then they are only allowed to use enough force to keep you from running away until the police show up (if you stole enough to be reported to the police).

An increasing TAT would be an indication that the firm is using its assets more productively. For example, if the TAT for 2003 was 2.2×, and for 2004 3×, the interpretation would follow that in 2004, the firm generated $3 in sales for each dollar of assets, an additional 80 cents in sales per dollar of asset investment over the previous year. Such change may be an indication of increased managerial effectiveness.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	a

And if you had a choice of being laid off, you would not be eligible for unemployment.  Unemployment is for people that lost their job and did not have any choice in the matter.  And as the other poster said, as long as they are paying at least minimum wage, you have no recourse other than looking for other employment, which is not a good idea these days.  You and your co-workers could do a work slowdown but that may force them to lay you off or try to fire you.
BoAEgaAGaa	First if your income was all reported to you on W-2s and the total is less than $5450 you will be receiving a refund of all your federal income tax withheld.  <br>  <br>  So if the job with the higher income withheld less federal income tax than the lower income job, this is just the result of how the employer withheld tax.  When you were first employed you may have completed your W-4 differently for each job.  This will determine how many exemptions you claimed, which the employer uses to figure your tax withholding.  <br>  <br>  So bottom line, all your income is combined to determine your tax liability.  If you have no liability you receive a refund of all your tax that was withheld, whether one employer withheld more than the other.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The answer to your question is:<br>  The more you make, the more the government keeps.<br>  The less you make, the less the government keeps.<br>  <br>  You are doing something very wrong if you think you are getting back money from each job.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Two questions you need to ask.<br>  1. What is the cost of refinancing.  There will be a number of fees associated with refinancing.  Your realtor should be able to come up with those numbers. Since you bought the house less than 1 year ago some fees normally charged like title insurance may be waved.<br>  2. How many months of lower payments will it take to equal that cost.<br>  <br>  If you plan to stay in your house longer that the payback time, then it is a good investment. If you are likely to stay in that home for 30 years the amount of savings over that time for 1.5-2% lower rate would be substantial.  It is also unlikely that interest rates will be this low anytime in the near future.|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	At this point your principal and interest payment is about $385 per month.  If you refinance $58K to 5% you're looking at a monthly payment of about $311 and at 5.5% $329.<br>  <br>  Let's take best case scenario and presume 5%.  That is a monthly savings of $74 per month.  But how much will it cost you to refinance in closing costs?  Let's say $2500.  So, dividing closing costs by monthly savings we get 33.78 (rounded to 34).  That's 34 months it will take to actually break even on the cost of the refinance.  Do you plan on staying in your home for more than 3 more years?  If yes, then it may be smart for you to refinance.  But if you're ultimately going to sell that house 36 months after you refinance you'll only have actually saved $150, if you sell 48 months after you'll have saved about $1000.  If you stay in the house for 30 years you'll have saved a lot over your original loan.<br>  <br>  Now, if you only go down to the 5.5% it will be a monthly savings of just $56, taking 45 months to break even if your closing costs are $2500.

A finance charge is what the bank is charging you to "use" their money. Whenever you carry a balance from one month to the next, meaning you don't pay off the entire balance each month, the bank charges you a percentage of the outstanding balance. <br>  <br>  The bank has loaned you money...you pay them for loaning you that money. That is how they make their money. To avoid a finance charge, pay your balance off in full each month.

AA11639059	The Russian mafia has been in the area, so they may have taken it when searching for the package the office manager had been withholding from them. It seems that the laundering operation in that branch was, um, using too much bleach because the Japanese mafia spotted it as they tried to exchange it to what the Italians were getting paid from their American cousins. Vito had a fight with Ivan and a few of the boxes they were searching got thrown out the window and the street kids collected them before backup could retreive them.
