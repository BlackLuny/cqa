20090223035425AAFNOpG	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	What is worse, an Irish society rich in heart or rich in wealth?	Rich in Heart you could help the worse off but would not have the money to do so.      Rich in Wealth you could help the worse off but would not have the heart to do so.      Note you cannot pick two. Either rich in heart or rich in wealth.      Yes I know you can be rich in heart and wealth, but that is not the question.      Maybe this poem may explain the question. You do not have to read the poem. It is a Recession do, so you may have time to do so.      Our personified girl      I heard her cry upon the mud and grass, that she once planted and gently watch grow,   I asked her how come you cry now, upon your ground, once more?   She failed to speak but walked further afield,   In a cloak, underneath which she bleeds?   Volumes of books lie upon her house, yet the new passages are ravaged with broken seams,   This not because of war or hunger, its reason being of greed,      I tried to grasp words from her, but she never ushered a word,   People talk for her; you can hear it in songs of passing weeks, seasons, years and centuries fold,   Yet I cant stop and be captivated by her,   Getting caught in her tears when I fall in bad weather, I leaving my umbrella at home for show,   They are many cattle she caters for,   Yet some cattle escape her grounds,   They do not listen to their owner’s words and caring call,   They think they know better,   What they know fails to yield,   It grows and dies, as these words anneal.      Within the quietened cities,   Among the shadowless business doors,   Foregone in bare branched houses,   It is only now we can really feel the cold, once more,   Waiting she is,   But her land is not as green,   Only by na?ve look, and pictures half seen.      Terrible is having nothing,   But far worse is having nothing within your skin,   So she cries upon the new seeds,   Hoping her tears may feed them the strength to grow, once more,   But also for them to realize-   That a people without a heart,   Aren’t a people at all?   When money comes, it is so easy for other things to go.      She is waiting for a new chapter,   For that, she will wait till time shuts close his doors,   She is our personified girl, our inner core,   We are but mere seeds,   Some seeds grow and grow,   Others stay hidden in the darkened earth.   Where they dissolve while they erode.      By Crazygirl2

20090223051155AAlTnZV	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	Why is it that South Africans ...?	So quick and loud about government yet when it comes to the private sector we just get taken to the cleaners and everyone accept?      Eg   Food prices last year the retailers increased their prices claiming that the oil price is high therefore (transportation and plastic packaging is expensive) but now the oil price is low now and none of them have dropped their prices infect they are increasing again.    Even the steel price is down we are being milked.    So there is no excuse for them to raise prices.      And its not just retailers its cars, medical aid, internet and DSTV that are ripping off the country?    Why are we so weak when it comes to the private sector?   Where is the fire we have when the government F's up?
