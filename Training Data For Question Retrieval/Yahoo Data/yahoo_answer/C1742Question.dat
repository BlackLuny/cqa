It happened previously to mine and my husband's socks and I put it down to them being misplaced when we moved into our new house.      However I'm very careful with baby socks as they're expensive, and her washing is done separately.  Her socks are always in pairs and now they're disappearing....      I've checked under the lip on the washing machine - the grey rubber bit that lifts up.  I can't take the whole silver bit out can I?

The killer of Rob Knox laughs all the way through the case and sentencing and didn't turn up to the court for the victim statement. What do you think is the appropriate sentence or punishment?      I believe he should be played the victim statement of Robs parentas in his cell again and again constantly till it drives him insane. If he hasn't got a conscience one should be drummed into him               And hard labour smashing stones for the rest of the time.      20 years minimum before parole is what he got in a cushy cell with playstation and entertainment.

I don't think that it was right for ok mag to pay for their wedding and what a joke that Jacks curfew was dropped for him to get married.

20090305062519AAkeMEk	News & Events;Current Events	Is it not about time to bring back dog licenses?	It seems to me that too many people are adopting the position that owning a dog is a right rather than a privilege. Shouldn't it be the case that a dog should undergo an annual health check from a vet and a license issued if the animal is in good care.      It would help curb the growing dog fighting scene and make it easier to ban irresponsible owners from even owning a dog. The money raised by the scheme could be used for things like housing unwanted or neglected pets and cover the costs of street cleaning to remove toilet waste.      I ask this as it seems that some dog owners think breeding deformed animals is acceptable.       http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk...

20090305061734AAnVBaG	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Why is it ok for media to be liberal biased but not conservative biased?	I know and agree that a lot of Fox News is biased towards the right wing.  However, people like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh don't claim to be journalists.  They are commentators, and most liberals will agree.  Keith Olberman and other like him are also commentators, with a liberal slant.      The problem I have is when people like Katie Couric, Tom Brokaw, and "journalists" for the New York times try to act like journalists, but often show off their left-leaning philosophies.      Why do so many liberals deny that the mainstream media is left-leaning?

20090305085628AAKKwxd	News & Events;Media & Journalism	What do you think about Glenn Beck's comments on the Fema Camps?	Well I know a lot of people like to watch Glenn Beck, I have a lot of respect for him. So, when I heard that he was going to discuss all of these rumors about the Fema camps I was excited to see what he had to say. He said that he wanted to "de-bunk" these rumors because he was tired of hearing about them. Later when he was being interviewed on Fox he said that after 3 days of research, he cannot disprove these conspiracy theories. I was hoping for a different answer, but seems to me he has found something that leads him to believe these camps exist. And if you know Glenn Beck, you know that he wouldn't just say that off the cuff, he does his research and he has tons of sources. Coming out of his mouth, these fema camps are seeming more real. I hope they are not! What do you think about this? And please no ignorant comments, I would appreciate serious comments only. Thank you in advance.

I am actually wondering if he is really just a performance artist, dedicated to showing the narrow-mindedness of typical conservative thought, in its worst and most ludicrous light.

A woman who lost both her legs as a child has been turned into a mermaid by the Lord of the Rings special effects team so she can go swimming.       Miss Vessey said: "One day a little boy came up, he must have been about four and he saw me taking off my (prosthetic) legs and he started with the 'why' questions, you know, 'why haven't you got any legs', etc. "And I said 'have you heard of The Little Mermaid and he said 'yes' and I said 'I'm a mermaid' and he got this look on his face and he said 'wow that's cool' and ran off to tell his dad.       The idea grew on her and so she wrote to Oscar winning Weta Workshop, which was also behind the stunning visuals in 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'King Kong', and asked them to make her a tail.       Miss Vessey says she is thinking of using the tail to help her complete the swimming section of a triathlon. She said: "I thought rather than just having it as a plaything, I would take it further." Miss Vessey began swimming after she had her first leg amputated at seven. Despite having her other leg amputated at 16, she swam competitively in high school and now swims as often as she can.        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopi...
