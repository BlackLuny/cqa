A guy in a gray suit gave me a test and told me to complete it. I didnt know what they were doing but i took the test. I remember three questions. They were:         1.) Combining f3 and sodium chloride creates:         2.) Nuclear power is made when:            3.) And the last question told me to make up an invention and draw out the plans for it. After i was done they looked at it and i heard the guy whisper to a lady that i scored a 138 on the test. They then told me they would call me in three days. What is going on please answer!

El corazón se me aceleró y una sensación de ilusión y alegría inundó mi alma... hasta llegar al final.   Ella me felicitó y me dijo que lo había hecho muy bien; y que, para la próxima vez, metería un poquito más. !Ni que decir tiene que ya estaba deseando que fuera la próxima vez!.   Pasaron varios dias…y este episodio, se habia convertido en algo cotidiano en mi vida.   Por eso hoy he querido compartir con todos mi felicidad.

20090222140058AAlEbc6	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Is this normal or is it weird?	Ok, so I posted some of my dreams on another question to ask if they were normal and I got mixed results. Dreams really fascinate me. Last night I had another one. I'm not joking, I really did have this dream:      There is a family of blonde people playing in the sand. Two parent, a 20 year old woman, two children who are around 14 or 15 and a baby. They are in like a sandbox which is inside a building. The family eventually leaves but they forget the baby. The 20 year old blonde come back to retrieve the baby since she is the mother. However, the place is not open and she has to get past security. To do this she turns into a dog (don't ask why, idk) . She eventually makes it to her child which is now (conveinently) a puppy. However, the puppy looks a bit fox-like. So then, out of nowhere, a fox pops up. Apparently he's the father. The dog and the fox begin to walk out of the building (they forget the puppy again, lol) and when they get to the outside I notice that they just exited my grandmothers house. I don't really know what the fox was doing but he fell down the front steps of the house. Instantly the dog is no longer a dog, but my best friend. She is rly mad at this fox, who has also turned human, because he is such an idiot. I also pop into the dream so that my friend has someone to complain to. We then make our way toward her van with her parents inside waiting for us. She is still mad at the guy but her parents invite him into the van. He then takes us on a tour of the town we are in, but he is so stupid that he often messes up where we are, even tho he has a magical sticky note that changes to tell u where u are. He needs this even tho there are signss by the monuments. He was such an idiot. Anyway, somehow the topi of Jack the Ripper came up (famous serial killer who had been mentioned in a show that I had watched the previous night). I said "jack the ripper killed a lot of ppl" and he said "jack the ripper killed your mom". then i woke up. I didnt get the joke at first but then i remembered that they said something abouit jack the ripper killing prostitutes on the show i had watched. So the joke actually works because it is implying that my mom is a prostitute. (she isnt btw,lol) You think thats normal? I'm normal when I'm awake.

20090222150202AAhCKmD	Social Science;Psychology	Ok this happened in the past i want this pain to stop popping up in my head?	ok well in my church i hung out with two girls i was so insecure around them and i still feel that way about my friends because almost all of them are prettier than me.Well i had told them something that was so personal and i thought i could trust them thinking oh they are my friends they would never do anything to hurt me.Well after i told them some stuff i did they pulled me aside one day while our church was hanging out and i cant remember i was, but this was her words she said to me,"Um Rachel you know that day you told us all that stuff about you life"   "Yeah what about it",I told her   "I cant hang around you anymore because all this stuff you did."   I could suddenly feel my heart start to pound i felt my stomach turn inside out.I was speechless she going to tell my parents what is going to happen then i looked over to the right and saw the older teen girls laughing and giggling they knew what ha pend.I could suddenly feel tears start to role down my cheeks i just walked off and hid where no one could see me.Then as we were driving home i wanted to tel my parents everything but i just couldn't, so when i went to bed i just cried myself to sleep for days and days i wanted to talk to them because no one else was there so i just started to hang out in the bathroom by myself and cry and i know church is not suppose to be this way and to this day i just can't tell anyone about my problems i am so insecure and i even have suicidal thought sometimes I've never tried to but wanted to, what do i do about these problems help me please!!!I just can remember how they would just have os much fun together and i remember one say i went up to them and i can't remember what they said but basically we don't want you here so i told my parents i was sick to my stomach and cried during the whole service int the restroom.I can remember seeing them and thinking if i wouldn't have done that stuff then this would have never happened and i could be living life like them.

Sometimes i get scared that i might have problems and i dont know why but that really does bother me... can anyone please tell something about this like how long is it supposed to last and what i can do to get rid of it. if it IS hormones than how is it supposed to last? thank-you
20090222152010AAIvO7z	Social Science;Psychology	What is an emotionally distraught woman to do....?	If my husband died tonight I would never know if he ever really loved me.  Two decades together doesn't always mean what it would appear.  Maybe it's me who doesn't love him the way I so much want to feel loved.  I don't know anymore.  Our marriage hasn't always been the best, ( felt like the best at times though)   It hasn't always been the worst either, ( has felt like the worst at times though)  It has honestly been like a roller coaster.  He is a decent man I guess, everyone else likes him well.  I used to feel the same way about him.  Truth is, I don't think I actually like him (his ways) anymore. I admit I have had much abuse from him...be it verbal, physical (not recently) and emotional as well.  I know he has been unfaithful to me more than once, left me and our children, more than once...seems that he thinks it's okay to come and go out of our home (long periods, as long as a month) whenever it's convenient for him/ there's been an argument and he can blame me for his leaving.  I wouldn't continue to take him back as I always do but I am insecure.  I worry I wouldn't be able to provide for me and the children without his help.  I worry that if I don't continue on this roller coaster with him  then I might cause more hardship for the kids and me than we already know.  I feel so worthless, unimportant, unproductive, ugly, old (I'm 44) and hopeless at times.  My only sight of some relief and joy will be when my children are grown and sufficient of themselves so that I won't have to worry about any consequences I might bring to them for parting with their dad.  Although at times I feel he is good enough to me, more often than not he can be very insensitive, hurtful and mean to me. I wish so much that I was worth the kind of love that some women feel from their husbands.  I don't know if I am loved or appreciated at all.  If it weren't for being trapped, I'd willingly leave him once and for all .....completely empty handed,  I think I'd be happier as a vagabond than the way I feel at this very moment.

20090222142207AAp0SO9	Social Science;Psychology	Do dreams really mean anything?	I've been looking into the study of dreams a little, and when comparing it to some of my dreams it seems to make sense. However, on other occasions I can't possibly see how they could mean anything ( ie. one of my latest wacky dreams, cylons invading atlantis which just happens to be my grandfather's garage, with teenage Salim from the    new movie "slumdog millionaire" being there too)      so my main question,    is there any proven scientific link Between your dreams and your emotions, feelings or personality?      I deliberatly hav'nt catogorized this in "social science>dream interpretation" as I fear it may be a little biased on the subject, so I'm trusting you in phycology/biology not to be biased either.

20090222151242AAQLmC8	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I have very strange, vivid, and long dreams every single night. whats wrong?	every night i can wake up and talk to you for an hour about the several dreams i had. and there not just about like running away from something scary or being late. they have the strangest things and the strangest people in them.       one of them was i was a scientist in a spaceship. to get around you had to crawl through those playpen things like in a burger king. at one point it was 3am and i was in the hotel part of the ship. my neighbor called me and asked me to come over and watch her baby so she can vacuum. when i went no one was there, the hallways were dark, and every room i looked in everyone was gone. i felt so threatened and i walked back into my room to find my dad sitting on my bed staring at me and it was the scariest thing ever. then i started jumping around making weird noises to scare him off. and i love my dad we have no big problems in real life, just normal ones.      then the past couple of nights ive had dreams i was fighting in a war. one in like an alaskan town and one on a field. and each time my side would win all the battles and at the last battle i would get shot in the neck. and i swear i could feel it.      these are just two of the ones. maybe you can tell me if they mean something or why i have dreams like this. i haven't gone one night in many months without having a crazy vivid dream. not that its a bad thing because even though they are weird sometimes it's enjoyable to sort of live a different life when you go to sleep. hahah well this may seem weird but if anyone else has things like this write please ! =)

20090222062622AAZYEFc	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream Help please and thankyou! I mean this dream I had was messed up!?	Drean #1)                    I had a dream that I knew this lady who was old but she hated to brush her teeth. So was affraid to brush them badly. So I told her to go have a bath and then we will go work on her "brushing teeth issue". She drownened in the bath tub and I had to do CPR on her. It worked but she turned into someone different.      2) I was at my house but it wasn't my real house. <---------If that at all makes sence.   And my backyard was big! It has a stream in it and I loved to go around it. So I had my friend, Payton over and we were just talking until we heard a buzzing noice. We went inside because I was deathly allergic to bee's (REAL LIFE I'M NOT) we kept on hearing the buzzing noice even inside. So I went down stairs and it was so odd. It was like an underground mine with crystals as the rough. And I looked around and I found bee's I started to run and the followed me. One stun me and I passed out. I remember then this guy named Matt  came and rescued me and put me in a hiding place no one would find me. He looked scared for me but like he owned me kind of scarness. I asked him who he was; he simply answered: "I was your boyfriend in past life. I was your your husband then too. But it always seems you get into trouble Rebekka and I always come and rescue you". He never said this in a  mean way. He was joking around. What do you think this means?

20090222102032AA4axfL	Social Science;Economics	Why All This Violence In Mexico? Why Is It In The Cartels' Interest To Do This?	There is a lot of violence aimed at the government in Mexico due to the fact they are increasing their continuing anti drug policies.       I don't understand why it is in the cartel leader's interest to kill these people I guess they won't take a bribe so what else can they do with these gov't officials.      But what I don't understand is that why wouldn't the drug people want to stay under the government's radar. If they destabilize Mexico to the point where it turns into Haiti the US is going to shut down the border to Mexico very tightly and even less drugs are going to be allowed into the US.

20090222153036AASAomV	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How would 1-gender societies be different?	I posed this question in someone else's question but I felt I should ask it here instead.      What would a society populated only by men look like? Sure, you'd have individual men who'd want to be nurses or teachers, but where would the gaps be? What sort of professions or roles would become most needed? Could society just adjust and encourage more men to work with children, or would there still be a shortage?      Flip it around. What roles in a woman-only society would become extremely important? Could society encourage more women to become fire fighters and police officers, for instance? Sure, women can't lift as much as men, but could fire-fighting gear be changed? If they wouldn't be as effective as men, overall, would men overall be as effective as women with small children?      But it's not as simple as women are nurturers, men are strong. Don't children benefit from having fathers or men around? Do they provide something here that a women-only society wouldn't? Don't police benefit from having women for social interactions, interviews, interrogations?      Remember, if you posit a single-gender society would be some kind of magnificent utopia, you're quite possibly mentally retarded.

20090222114247AAhA4Wx	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why does my dream mean?	Last night I dreamt that I got three new roommates and moved into a nice apartment that had about five rooms or so. There was a big fish tank in it with a really gigantic yellow and orange fish that took up half of the tank, with about ten or so small fish swimming around, too.   The apartment was not in the town where I go to college, and it wasn't in the town that my roommates went to college in. I go to KU, and for some reason, two of my other roommates went to KSU.   The ones who went to KSU decided to move out, so it was just me and this guy I don't know who went to KU too.   I told him that I was going to move out because the apartment wasn't near KU, and he dragged me into a hallway and sexually assaulted me.   I cried out for help, and a good friend of mine (who also goes to KU but wasn't one of my roommates in the dream) came to my rescue.         --------------------   Lately, I've decided to quit my sorority and go apartment hunting with a current roommate. (The friend who rescued me is not a roommate.)      Also, I have a boyfriend who treats me very well, so why'd I dream of sexual assault? The one who assaulted me was not my boyfriend.

(And let me tell you, this guy was amazingly hot as heck. He was wearing skinny jeans, and I think a like black t shirt.) my mom and dad were sitting in the back, I don't know who else was in the car. We were driving to my house, and then somehow we were at this soccer game and my parents and the guy that was driving in our car's dad was watching this soccer game too. Me and the guy went inside this one like place, and it had like chairs and couchs. You could defineltly tell that me and the guy were into eachother. He was like slapping my butt and when he did that I was like "Ohh, my turn now!" Then I slapped his but. Then, we were sitting on the couch like really close and then people were like signing my shirt so, then he signed my shirt and i'm like "You better not sign it there!" I was like pointing to my boobs So, then he kind of did, and then I like put my leg over his leg and then he put his leg on mine.. and I put my hand kind of by his, ya know! and then, he like slipped his hand down my pants and like put it there.. then I woke up, and I was kind of pissed off because it was a dream and I like barly never have dreams like this at all! plus, the guy was frickin gorgeous! I tried to go back to sleep, and I did and then we were like outside and we were like sitting down, and me and him were like makingout with toung and hugging. I was sitting on his lap and then one guy was like "What are you guys doing, you know there's police right there, right?" So, then I looked back and I saw the police, so then I was like "Oh, my bad." and then we somehow, were like at this dance place, and both of my ex-boyfriends were there. Logan was grinding this one girl, and my other ex-boyfriend was like sad, I think he saw me and that guy makingout and stuff so, me and him went up to Erick and we were like "Hey, what's up.." and he just like looked at me...So we walked away.

My grades are slipping because every one of my teachers think that I only have one class...the one that they teach...so they cram so much homework that it destorys the little social life I have. My brother had the same teachers that I have this year, and he said they were awesome and did'nt do anything in their classes work related...but now every teacher gives me a big pile of work every day. It's like "Well Good Morning...here's an assload of work" And Tuesday...work...and Wednesday...Work...and Thur...   While my  brother does nothing in his classes this year...or last year. He had Beach Day in his Calc class Friday...guess what I did in my math class friday...you guessed it...WORK      I'm a smart kid, but I go to a really smart school. A school where kids think they are failing in a class, when they really have an 86 in the class. In every class, it's like I'm in a room full of super-brained kids...relaxed over-achievers, and it feels like I'm the only one who has to bput effort in the work i have to do...it's like they enjoy work...like their friggin' robots. THere was this" rave" on FRiday...not a drug rave, but an organized social gathering by a city youth group. Oh wow...I never knew raves were organized and advertised where police could find out. " Hey Jack( that's not my name, by the way, just an example), are you going to the rave...hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaa" " Are you going to the rave...rave rave rave rave rave" NO, I CAN'T GO... I'm to busy not going to the friggin rave      Don't get me wrong, I'm an honor roll student...but so is about 60% of the school..and the other 40% are about 2 points away from getting onto it. I'm in the Academic team( as if you didn't think I was a nerd already) because my parents force me. I'm not good at it because all the questions are about operas and European fine literatute...not math or history. My parents don't allow me to do sports, and my mom has to dress me every day( not clothes or stuff, but she HAS to put cover-up, lip cream, and he has to comb my hair so I look like a F*G). She DECIDED my classes for next year. "Okay, you're going to take Calc CP(even though I could take AB, she's scared of math), you're going to take Anatomy..." It just feels like she won't let me do anything except go on the play games in my room listening to Metallica. And whenever I try to do something that she doesn't like...she just says" Hormones, hormones", and walks away because she doesn't wanna hear it      I don't really have a social life. All my friends are seniors, and I have no underclassmen friends. I don't know what I'm going to do when they leave for college. Plus, they're all very annoying too. If I hear another story about the differences between a Corvette and a Land Crusier...I swer to God...         I work at Ace Hardware, and I'm horrible at it, and I hate the people at my shifts. I want to work with my brother on his shifts, but my boss says were understaffed on cashiers on my shifts...WE have 5 cashiers and we only need 2 on my shift. By the way, their are only 4 registers. 5-4 equals that I could friggin move to the sunday shift   My grades are slipping to B's...still pretty good grades, but my Honors teachers says that I should drop to CP courses,    WTF. It's like if I miss one question on a test I can't be good at school. It's...unexplainable. I'm sick of this high school bullshmit   Well, that's pretty much my life this semester. I know I'm not a refugee in Iraq, or m family didn't die of malaria in Sudan...but I always feel that I can't feel bad about my life because some African boy has it worse.    I'm also kinda worried that one of my teachers is reading this and will answer..."THis is Mr. X, I'll see you on Monday with extra homework"    Whenever my mind tries to make me feel better, it always has to come up with another point to make me fell horrible...an undebatable point...   ...I just don't know anymore...4 more months of school...without any days off because we missed 2 days in SEptembber due to constructuion. 56 million in taxpayers money...

20090222140406AAVh8LT	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What could this dream mean?	I dreamed that my dad, brothers, and I went to Africa, and stayed in some sort of hotel, and then everyone there suddenly freaked out and started to evacuate. I ran outside and looked to the northwest and saw gigantic storm clouds moving towards us. I knew that 1. storms actually move from east to west and drift off the west coast due to the trade winds, and 2. we were in an either arid or semi-arid zone, where not much rain falls. Because it was so bizarre, climate change briefly flashed through my mind. Somehow, I got separated from my family and then saw some people from my school waving and saying hi to me. I waved back, then searched for my family, but they were nowhere in sight. So I left the hotel on my own and evacuated on foot, although I still didn't understand what was going on. I kept thinking that there would be a major flood. An isolated cloud passed over, and it rained briefly. There was no thunder, because the major storms had not arrived, but I assumed they had, so I was terrified. I saw people getting in cars and driving away, and others running on foot. I never found my family, and before anything else happened, my dad woke me up for breakfast, abruptly ending my dream. Recently, I've had many strange dreams and I wonder, could this mean something? Please tell me what you all think. By the way, I was born and raised in the U.S. and I'm mixed Black and Native American, and I'm not from Africa. Can someone help me figure this out? The strangest thing about it is that sometimes my mother has dreams that are actually visions of the future. Whenever she has strange dreams, many of them come true. Some of the dreams I've had in the past, in a way, came true, but the stuff that happens in my dreams later happened to someone else in reality, and I hear about it in the news. Did I receive my mom's "gift?" I need some opinions and/or facts, please?!?
20090222135520AAP6VBt	Social Science;Other - Social Science	What do I do? And Where Do I go From Here?	I am a year away of getting into college/university. I know for sure tat I want a career in the human/social services field.       At first, I wanted psychology.... then I realized i have a low chance of getting into the programs with my low grades also that, being a psychologist with a phD takes a real long time. Then I'm like "i'll try social work... its not as hard to get into and if u get a master's then you'll make a decent amount of money". Now my problem is that, I dont know what I see myself as. I've heard social work is a burnout for many.. and I dont wanna waste my time with that. I want a career where I'll be able to have the opportunity to work with children ( no not guidance counsellor or ECE), mostly teens and young adults. Everytime I decide on a career that I want to "focus" on I overanalyze it and then I feel as if I'm not the right person. What should I do? I'm thinking now that i should get a degree in something else like psych or sociology to broaden my opporunities in other work ( such as business) and if i decide to later on, I can do my MSW in social work, where I'll be able to make more money than with just an undergraduate degree.      I don't know what to do. I dont want to go to college or university regretting all the money I've wasted because I did something else. I dont want to be those people in the future hating my job and not being financially and independently stable. Iwant to be able to support my own family, without depending on anyone else. I want to be happy in my future.       Somebody please help!! Sorry for my long essay :(
20090222125038AAv0T5r	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Crying, hugging, in the Attic... Dream interpretation please! :)?	I had dream last night that I was in an attic, but not my own, the attic was very big, well lit and clear from clutter. I was laying on a couch under a blanket and there were others in the attic with me. One person was on another couch watching TV. As I am laying there, the man I am interested in was in another room of the attic vacuuming, he then came into the room I was in with the vacuum - it was on and he was cleaning. He and I had an argument and he began crying. I saw that he was upset, so I got up and followed him to the top of the stairs, he was about to walk down, when I stopped him. I acknowledged that he was crying, and told him I just wanted to give him a hug, he was resistant at first, then I told him, I won't kiss you just want to hug you. Then he turned toward me and we hugged, I was rubbing his shoulder and hugging him wholeheartedly. Then he fixed his hat, that was on his head, and descended down the stairs. As he was leaving an older gentleman (a stranger to me) was walking up the stairs and turned to him, the guy I hugged, and said: "I need you at the monastery", he nodded, the older man continued up the stairs and I went back to the room I was in and believe I went back on the couch. Then I woke up.      Sort of confusing.. Your interpretations are appreciated. Thanks!

20090222140244AAoJId9	Social Science;Economics	Few economic questions....?	1. A comic book company pays an annual licensing fee of $10,000 for the rights to an artist's character. Which would have the bigger effect on the readers of that character's comic: an increase in printing costs or an increase in the artist's licensing fee? Explain.      2. Explain why a rent increase at Tony's Pizza Parlor would not cause Tony to raise his prices, but a rent increase at Tony's competitors may cause him to raise prices.      3.A person argues that if the prison sentences for all crimes were doubled, this would worsen the problem of overcrowded prisons, all other things being equal. Use the concept of demand to explain why this argument is incorrect.      4. Suppose there are only two goods (bread and wine) and only two countries (England and Portugal). In England, the cost of producing 1 bottle of wine is 3 loaves of bread. What is the cost of producing 1 loaf of bread in England? Under what circumstances will England specialize in bread production and purchase its wine from Portugal? Explain.      thanx in advance :)   plz when u answer write which # u answer thnx :)

20090222141938AArWQKK	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream that i was shot by 2 people, firing squad style, several times while my back was turned to them.?	I knew that i was going to be killed and it wasn't a bad thing. Kind of like it was part of a game. I was only afraid that it was going to hurt. I had to walk several yards away from the people who were going to shoot me. I can't remember who they were but i did know them. They shot me several times and I fell to the ground on my stomach. I was shot in the back and in the neck but i did not die and it did not hurt. I only felt uncomfortable because i couldn't move and i was surprised that i didn't die and it didn't seem like i was going to. I was scared that they were going to leave me alone without finishing me off. I felt very relaxed as if i was drifting into sleep and then i woke up.      What does this dream mean?

20090222142934AApIeIF	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	People blaming women for getting pregnant and wanting or not wanting the baby?	I've been here for about 10 minutes reading and i've been reading a lot of whiners. When a couple has sex, both of them have to realize that there is a chance that the woman will get pregnant. If she gets pregnant then both of you should have been prepared for that possibility. You should also be prepared for the possibility of her not wanting or wanting to keep the baby. I'm not 100% sure, but if a guy really wants to have a baby i think there's people out there who have baby's for other people. Act like adults, rant over.

I'm really scared of it now cause I don't know what's after. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this on here. I guess I just want someone to make me feel better about it. The thing is that I'm still pretty young(15) and I have a pretty long life ahead of me but this is all i'm thinking about. I don't even think this is normal and I doubt any of my friend worry about it as much as me. I just want some reassurance that death isn't the end and that there's something more..
