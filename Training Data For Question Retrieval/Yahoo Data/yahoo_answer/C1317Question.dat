20090408150825AAooUua	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Biology biology biology?	multiple choice please answer the question in the parenthesis      A long time ago, a man named Fleming saw threads dividing. What he actually saw was long strands of DNA and protein termed (chromatin / spindle / chromosome). When cells are ready to divide, the chromatin begins to coil and condense. The chromatin will wrap around proteins termed (histones / ribosomes / mitase). Once it is condensed and wrapped around the histones, it can be called chromosomes or (hetero / eu) chromatin. This is usually seen during cell division. Otherwise, it is termed (hetero / eu) chromatin and is used for protein synthesis. Chromosomes are present at cell division. They are composed of (2 / 4 /9 ) chromatids and are called (brother / sister / same) chromatids. The chromatids are held together in the middle by a (central point / centromere / centrosome).     A normal human chromosome number contains (23 / 46 / 92) pairs of chromosomes or (23 / 46 / 92) chromosomes. We consider this a full set of chromosomes or (haploid / diploid) number.

I've read some other Q and A here on Yahoo about this subject and am still highly unsettled about the accepted answers.   Take this link for example    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=...    You all say that it is acceleration that breaks the symetry or ?a, but what if the acceleration only happens during 1% of twin II's journey and the rest of the time he coasts. Is the entire time discrepency take place just in the accelerating periods? Because during the time that he coasts it seems the motion really is symetrical. And yet by actual experimental data this doesn't seem to be the case. It would seem to me that there must be something else responsible for breaking the symetry. Suppose also that at the furthest point of twin II's journey he stopped and we then accelerated the earth to meet twin II. What happens then? I'd like to suggest something different such as the proximity to mass or matter that breaks the symetry. What do you think?

Yet, for the sake of debate, which of the following choices proves most logical:      1) All in nature existed eternally      2) Something in the natural existance is the source of all that ever existed in the natural, (including by evolution)      3) Something beyond nature, and with NO intelligence, is the source of all in nature      4) Something beyond nature, and with intelligence, is the source of all in nature      5) Some other conclusion, (although no other conclusion can be formed without some sort of redundancy).      Please, explain your logic and reason for your conclusion. Logic and reasoning is key.      Thank you for all and any answers.

I mean, its sounds very interesting and cool, but (for those who are anesthesiologists) does it get boring, grabbing new needles EVERY operation, filling them with drugs, then administering them.  Doesn't that get tedious, maybe boring (please not i dont know how long this procedure takes-just watche da vid on it though)?        What is your favorite part about being an anesthesiologist?

20090225181320AApF06H	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	December 21st, 2012: legitimately scary?	Ha! Caught you! The question swerves abruptly:      Check out Sony Pictures' viral advertising campaign for the Roland Emerich-directed 2012. Woody Harrelson as a crazy person? Genius!      But seriously, look at the Institute for Human Continuity web site they've created. Graphics look classy, science is obviously bogus and ridiculous, and of course Sony has to link from the bottom...but I think that plenty of the morons who regularly post here about this garbage might just fall for it.      So my question is: is stoking "end of the world" fervor to promote a movie -- and a bad movie at that, courtesy of noted over-the-top-with-special effects (10,000 BC, The Day After Tomorrow) director Emerich -- ethical? Should Sony feel good about themselves doing this?

It seems more a nightmare then a dream.      It starts of with me standing in a dark, small room with the noise of chains coming from the walls. It's pitch black and you can barley see your hand in front of your face; but it's like these shadows of people running back and forth- some of the shadows are really big, and seem too big to be a human.   Suddenly it's like a group of hands block my vision and there are these guttural screams and cries of men and women. It all then stops and there's nothing but silence for a second or so until a white light over takes the room. The noise and hands stop. But there's still a faint scream. And before I wake up I see a face of a old woman. I sometimes wake up screaming it's so frightening.      It's becoming more and more frequent. I don't even want to reach out and turn on my lamp I get so scared.   What does it mean?

I know that there are methods like "guess and check", and "work backwards", and "take your problem as solved".

20070403121911AANke16	Science & Mathematics;Physics	String theory?	do you believe in string theory?   do you believe that the k=theory is relevant??      Witten has argued that K-theory is relevant to string theory for classifying D-brane charges. D-brane objects in string theory carry a type of charge called Ramond-Ramond charge. Ramond-Ramond fields are differential forms, and their charges should be classifed by ordinary cohomology. But gauge fields propagate on D-branes, and gauge fields give rise to vector bundles. This suggests that D-brane charge classification requires a generalization of cohomology to vector bundles -- hence K-theory.      what do you think??      i think he's got a point

During Gregor Mendel's first experiment, the cross-fertilization of pea plants (crossing a true-breeding tall plant with a true-breeding short plant), the resulting offspring showed only the dominant tall trait. How can you best explain this?      a) The resulting offspring were all heterozygous, and thus the recessiv trait was not shown.      b) The resulting offspring were all homozygous dominant, and thus th recessive trait was not present.      c) The resulting offspring were a mix of homozygous and recessive, and the dominant trait appearing is due strictly to chance.      d) The resulting offspring were all heterozygous, and the dominant trait appearing is due strictly to chance.               If you answer, you get best answer :)
