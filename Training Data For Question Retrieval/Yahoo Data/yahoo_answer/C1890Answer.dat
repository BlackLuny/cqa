To many hosts on one segment, or segmenting for security reasons, then you can control traffic between them with a router and/or firewall.|`|lObEjUh1aa	if i remember correctly, i believe the general purpose of implementing VLANs is to allow segmenting of a network at the switch level (layer 2) without involving a layer 3 device (such as a router).<br>  <br>  one purpose is to enhance security by preventing traffic in one VLAN from being seen by hosts in a different VLAN.

If it did not, then you either have a bad monitor or a bad video card.<br>  100% is your monitor problem.<br>  |`|lObEjUh1aa	if this is a CRT (not a flat screen) type monitor -- and you mean that the image is fluctuating -- then this most likely indicates there is a source of a magnetic field somewhere near the monitor.  some CRTs will automatically degauss themselves if a strong enough magnetic field is present -- this appears as an image vibration that typically lasts 2 - 3 seconds.<br>  <br>  common sources of magnetic fields are speakers, other CRT monitors, and any electronic device (all electronic devices produce magnetic fields, but most are far too weak to affect a CRT).<br>  <br>  if by "shaking" you don't mean that the image is vibrating, but that the monitor itself (the whole plastic enclosure) is physically shaking, there is something severely wrong.  most likely it means the monitor hardware has suffered some kind of critical failure and it's only a matter of time until it stops working altogether.  unfortunately, given the high voltages inside CRT tubes, most technicians are not qualified to repair them.  for the few that are qualified, their services will most likely cost more than just replacing the monitor, so in the event of a monitor hardware failure, replacement is your most cost effective option.<br>  <br>  i strongly doubt you are in any danger from the monitor, though you should certainly be careful, as like i said, CRT tubes store truely impressive amounts of energy and a shock from the inside of a CRT can be fatal.  you don't have to worry about the monitor exploding; if a CRT fails it does the opposite -- it actually implodes -- but you don't want to touch any CRT after an implosion, due to the risk of a potentially fatal high voltage shock.  CRT tubes (including TVs) build up so much charge that when powered off and unplugged (isolated from ground), the tube can store enough energy to deliver a harmful shock even weeks after unplugging.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say with all of this is, if you have a CRT that is physically shaking, the safest bet is just to replace it.|`|qaON17PMaa	shouldn't really shake<br>  <br>  reinstall graphics drivers<br>  <br>  could be an old monitor. the cables aren't in properly....<br>  <br>  it really depends

So your 300 watt PSU is normally meant to be used for 200W.|`|kpBDMuOraa	if it is 300 watts max, you can figure in that you can run your motherboard, and 3 drives with it.  with a video card, network card and sound card.<br>  <br>  The power supply that I got for very cheap is an 800 watt maximum earthwatts power supply.<br>  <br>  One thing I warn every computer user about is cheap power supplies.<br>  <br>  Power supplies will go out and when they do they can damage your motherboard, hard drive, video cards and several other items connected to your computer.  Get A Good Power Supply that is where the computer starts operating and it is the most vital part of the computer.|`|L0zmN7CVaa	Power output is 12v DC max. What you may be more concerned with is how many Watts it is capable of sustaining. The greater the demand due to hardware demands (processor,RAM,audio & video processors, hard drives, etc.) the more important the ability to maintain supply of current. Current is the ability to do work. Voltage is the potential to move electricity (current). Wattage is the product of voltage times current. A good rule of thumb is to calculate what your maximum load will be, and then allow 50% more for "head room". An average computer will usually have 350 Watts output.

Y0kuQNDdaa	If your machine has a 1/8" input (standard for speakers/headphones), then a shielded 1/8" to RCA converter should provide the same quality and it will be noticeably cheaper. <br>  <br>  For s-video, most video cards have that ability. When you look at a video card it will give you the information such as:<br>  <br>  Interfaces/Ports:<br>  2 x DVI Dual Link DVI<br>  1 x TV Out<br>  <br>  Something along those lines.

Newer computers, within the last 4 years or so, most likely come with two speaker choices, for stereo in the back, or front. However, if it does not, you will want to buy a new sound card. And Video cards, with TV-tuner, have S-video slots. First you will want to look up your motherboard though, and find out what PCI slots are available, or, if you know how to tell, open your computer and look for yourself.|`|h5Qim12saa	No.

Then save the file to a location of your choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  FOR /F "tokens=2*" %%a IN ('reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\AVG\Avg8" /v "AvgAllUsersDir"') DO (SET avgdatapath=%%~fb)<br>  del "%avgdatapath%\update\download\*.ctf"<br>  <br>  <br>  When you save the file... I suggest you use the file name ResetCTF.cmd and make certain that the Save as type option is set as All Files and not Text Document<br>  <br>  After you save it, to run the file with Windows 2000 or XP just click on the file. In Vista you need to right click and select "Run as Administrator"<br>  <br>  If it was created properly, you should see a black Command box flash on the screen briefly, if it was not created properly NOTEPAD or your default text editor will open.<br>  <br>  Once you have run that file... try updating AVG again.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the problem persists... Then something must be corrupting your CTF files. This can be either a disk/file corruption or the corruption chould be happening when the file is being downloaded. The following should help if its a normal file/disk corruption or a problem in your system's cache/temp files.<br>  <br>  First let's start by cleaning up all temporary files and check for registry issues. I prefer a util called CCleaner found at [www.ccleaner.com] which does an even better job than the Windows Disk Cleanup and it also can check for registry issues. When checking for registry issues, run it about 3-4 times until it lists no other issues.<br>  <br>  Check your hard drive for file/system errors by running chkdsk. Open My Computer and right click on Local Disk C: selecting Properties, click the Tools tab and in the Error Checking area click the "Check now" button and select both options. It will tell you that it can't test the drive right now and it will ask if you want to schedule it for the next system startup... select Yes. Restart your computer so that it can check the drive. This test will take some time to run and at times may appear stalled but just let it run.<br>  <br>  Follow up all of that with a full Defrag to ensure the best performance you can of the system.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If the problem is actually caused by your internet connection itself or your internet proxy cache ( if either you or your ISP use one ) is corrupted, then this won't address those possible causes. This also doesn't address if the cause is from a malware that is on the system or any possible hardware failures that could also result in a corrupted file. |`|4e3bf5fad31a7ed3956b4bc2c191bba5aa	had the exact same problem<br>  go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.strategyonline.co.za/blog/?p=876" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategyonline.co.za/blog/?p=...</a><br>  they give you a little file that resolves the issue for you.  it deletes invalid files from your avg folder, after this is done, you can click update in AVG again and it should work properly|`|SMdPyfNjaa	I use AVG and that never happened to me

It's stupid adding random people, if you don't have the intention of getting to know them better because that defeats the purpose of "social networking."

I know very little about websites and hosting but am trying to learn. <br>  I finally decided on quick2host? <br>   Frankly speaking it is because they were the only company that responded to my preliminary questions in a timely manner. <br>  Due to my inexperience I have run into a couple problems and have contacted quick2host for help. <br>  They, especially Mr. Jagan have been absolutely incredible. I may not know much about hosting companies, but, I do know customer service when I receive it.<br>  Our sites have never been down, everything I need (even when I didn't know until later I needed) they have supplied. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this company. They truly have made the learning process much easier.<br>  If the service continues as it has been which I can't see it changing, I would never leave them. Their service, pricing, and people are beyond any expectations.<br>  I would never hesitate to recommend QUICK2HOST to anyone and have been doing so. You truly could not ask for more from a hosting company i mean $1.9/month is the most economical price in industry...so i feel it's good and we will continue to do business with them.|`|wM4i3hDVaa	Well, Quick2host, is just great host, The best overall is the customer support, especially the live support. The executives respond well and the ticket support system works great. During the initial months of setting up my website, the customer support was very handy.<br>  The uptime is also great. I have never faced any problems with the server going down till now. <br>  I got 1 year of hosting completely free with my 2 years of hosting, hence a fabulous 33% discount, which nobody else in the industry is offering.

They have 24/7 support that actually answers your tickets and really is helpful. This past weekend I was forced to move a website of one of the businesses because their web host decided to just change their email policies without notifying their customers, and then didn't respond to my frantic attempts to contact them all day to correct the situation. Finally, I mailed quick2host at 2:12 AM and got reply from a helpful tech who helped me figure out how to migrate everything to quick2host. I called several times over the weekend and always received a quick courteous answer.Within an hour I had the website and a very involved mailing list all ready to go! <br>  I m so happy and luck that i m with quick2host.., well thanku lethoso loves indian here a lot, and the way they talk is much polite and helpful than most of the people in the world, I speak sepedi (my home language) but even then they were so comfortable talking to me in english..<br>  Thanks! quick2host Cheers!, <br>  <br>  <br>   jenifer klusner,<br>  lethoso, South Africa|`|KbEhz6fFaa	Hi , I am taking Quick2host services from the last two years.

MbUi01dCaa	First of all, I'd recommend using uTorrent as a Bittorrent client, because it uses a lot less system resources that any of the others (and it is just as fast). Secondly, the speed of a torrent depends heavily on the trackers (web servers that tell your computer where to download from) and other peers (the people that send you the file). To make sure that it is just the torrent client, run a speed test:<br>  <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/</a><br>  <br>  If the download speed is still 100kb/s on the speedtest, then you need to check your networking configuration.<br>  <br>  If not, then try these things:<br>  -If you are connected to the internet through a broadband router, configure QOS (quality of service) to allow your computer to have maximum priority on your network. <br>  -If you are connected through a broadband router, make sure that it is forwarding the ports to your computer<br>  -Make sure that protocol encryption is forced, because Comcast might be capping network traffic on Bittorrent (though they claim they don't)<br>  <br>  If you don't know what any of these things are I'll be happy to provide a tutorial :)
AA11780191	Technology companies like Facebook or any company that is considered 'high growth' are valued not only by the amount of money they make, but how much money they stand to make.  When Google picked up YouTube for $1.65B, the site wasn't making any money then.  It still isn't making much money now, but it does have HUGE potential for monetization.  Investors who bet on companies like Facebook or YouTube aren't investing on the fundamentals, ie - its intrinsic value based on assets and current profits.  They're gambling on their speculated valuation based on the potential for its business to be further monetized.  Take Craigslist, for example.  That's a business that can easily, EASILY be seriously monetized.  But rather than sell out to investors, they've stayed private.  They're able to turn a huge profit while only monetizing ~1% of their website (job and real estate listings).<br>  <br>  In the case of Facebook, they have what's essentially the Holy Grail of marketing.  They have REAL information on REAL people who are voluntarily contributing an abundance of information about their personal interests, their relationships to others and, by clicking or not clicking on ads, either verifying or refuting their likelihood to click on ads and their interest in different products.  Businesses used to pay huge $$ for this kind of information - through surveys, studies, etc.  Advertising rates would be based on Nielsen's ratings for a given show combined with metrics as to who the audience /probably/ was, eg - 18-24 y/o single male.  With Facebook, they're getting EXACT information.  22 y/o single female grad student belong to X, Y, and Z networks, who has previously clicked on ads for 'teeth whitening', 'yoga dvds' and 'musical instruments.'  With this info, advertisers can better target their audience and are willing to pay a premium for this kind of highly targeted advertising.|`|KXBGhPLhaa	lots of advertisements! lol. and events facebook may host|`|alAtUXvyaa	advertisements, and it is bcause many billions of people visit the website every day and a LOT of them click on the advertisements, and it really builds up.|`|VfbsGjYSaa	By selling advertisement spaces.

SHXzkL6Gaa	The 7900GS would give you a better gaming experience. It has more bandwidth and will allow you to play games at either a higher resolution or with more "eye candy" features enabled than the 7600GT. The downside is that it has higher power requirements, so you would need a more powerful power supply. The difference is not huge, but if your power supply is close to it's limits you may have to go with a card with lower power requirements (or upgrade your PSU).<br>  The 7900 may also overclock better than the 7600 because the 7900GS is running the lowest clock speed that the 7900 core supports and the 7600GT is actually running at the top clock speed that the 7600 core supports.

I know, I know... we have seriously lost that, but I thought I'd just bring up that point.<br>  <br>  Now, besides the government tax crap, think of it this way:<br>  When someone steals something like a macbook (or anything for that matter), Apple then has to write this off as a loss if it is stolen from a store or a shipment.  However, that isn't the end of it.  At the end of the year, when taxes and stuff are due, Apple gets to count that toward them, so then they don't have to pay the tax that the macbook would have generated.  This is known as a tax writeoff.  The bad thing is, when something is written off, someone else is not getting their money (schools, roads, bridges, new corvettes :], etc.).<br>  <br>  And we are now back to the idea of "There is no such thing as a free lunch".<br>  <br>  When you steal the macbook, you're actually stealing from yourself and your kids.|`|b406a52c9a7d704fc317ca32aca13e56aa	hey its mikedonelardo,im just using another acount since i cant answer my own question haha <br>  <br>  anyway i agree with indiginous' answer but i beg to differ in the context that i live in a third world country.

Any link that sends you to something that starts with "ad" or "adserver" is usually not somewhere you want to go.<br>  <br>  I recommend downloading Ad-Aware and a pop-up blocker in the future to help you with these issues, and stay away from downloading toolbars and other "fun" gimmick tools on the internet, because most of them come with spyware and other junk that you don't even realize is running when you install it - like the "Registry Cleaner" icon that appeared on your desktop.|`|heXiCKepaa	I have an automatic download from Windows for all critical fixes.  I have not heard of any such problem or gotten any download from the Windows site.  I have installed a registery cleaner before from a legitimate site, and have not heard of any problem from them, either.  When I first got the message you are talking about in my e-mail, I marked it as spam and deleted it.  I never open any e-mail I do not recognize, and I never download anything from a link inside any e-mail that I receive.  I go directly to the sites I deal with by typing the address into my address bar (and that is NOT the address given inside any e-mail).  E-mails often direct you to phony sites that look like the real site.  They are not easy to identify as a phony site.  If you give them your credit card or bank information, they can drain your account before you can realize it has happened.  I would recommend that you delete the e-mail without opening it, that you ignore it, and that you ignore any spam that you have or have not recognized.  My philosophy is if I didn't ask for it, I don't need it, and I probably don't want it.  If I want it, I'll find it myself.  Most spam is from crooks.|`|qNvPOWymaa	Well since the icon magically appeared on your Desktop (assuming you didn't deliberately install something that created it), your computer may also have spyware or a hidden program installed.<br>  <br>  Don't download that software, and run a Spyware cleaner.

If you do, then all you need to do is find the card you want, with either an AGP, PCI, or PCIE connection (depending on what you have), buy it, and install it (and the drivers).

12759ec713beeff3bb7e7eb7e69699cbaa	Well I don't suspect it is a keylogger, it may just be a cursor that someone set on your computer.  Like have u ever seen on a website " Cool cursers for free"? Someone may have downloaded that and changed the cursor to what u think looks like a a key logger.  But if it is a key logger there is somethign that u can do that i have on my computer. All you have to do is download AVG Free Edition nad as soon as you do launch AVG by clicking on the icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  Then all you have to do is run a computer scan and then it will alert you if u have any viruses.  If you do it will be moved to a thing called the virus vault and once in there you can delete the virus fromm ur computer.  Ohh and once its in the vault it is inactive.  Hope u can get rid of.|`|HVlc9ezKaa	That's not a keyl ogger. Key loggers have nothing to do with cursors (If they do they are the worst and most obvious key logger ever). They are just programs that take all the input from a keyboard and store them in the order the keys were pressed. Then they are sent to a server or email address if they were put on the computer remotely. If someone at your house put it there for security reasons more than likely it's just saved in some folder for later activation.|`|8gzcMs6raa	try<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fagex.official.ws" rel="nofollow">http://www.fagex.official.ws</a>

kKsM09fdaa	Firstly, not all operating systems support 4GB of RAM memory. Only 64bit OSs do (i.e. Vista 64bit, Windows XP 64bit), so if you upgraded from 3GB of RAM, then there wouldn't be any change. Other than that, your gaming performance is probably hindered by your VGA card, if you have one. It may be too old for WoW or you may be using just the integrated 3D acceleration provided by the motherboard you have. If this is tha case, then you can have a limited amount of memory asigned to video (which is probably maxed out). My advice to you is to get a newer VGA card which will probably increase the performance for 3D games considerably.<br>  Also check that your internet connection is not bottlenecking your game performance. If you have a bad connection, then no matter how good your PC is, you'll still have a diminished frame rate due to lag and the necessity to skip frames of the animations to keep up.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	Make sure your computer is actually reading the RAM.<br>  <br>  And RAM doesn't fix everything, I'm betting it's a video card issue.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	In Order to increase the FPS you will need to upgrade your Graphics card.

In most systems the speed bottle neck is the hard drive. There is some info below on this topic. Years ago before the drives had their own cache there were cache cards you could buy and the drive plugged into it. But I have not seen those in a while. All a person can do at this time is get the fastest drive possible or go to a RAID configuration. Soon the drives will become solid state go things will get better.|`|qGwuJPCzaa	Assuming you upgraded the amount of ram versus speed and type of ram, you probably didn't need the upgrade.<br>  <br>  Adding more ram doesn't necessarily mean better performance if you had more than enough ram in the first place.<br>  <br>  The next thing to hit up is your graphics card.

Pv4Z88wPaa	First thing is....Did Verizon supply you with a wireless router?  I know you have a DSL modem but if it does not have wireless capability built into it you need another device to go wireless.  Sorry if you already knew that.<br>  <br>  If it is a wireless router and DSL modem all in one (never heard of one) then you DO NOT need to install the Verizon software.  Just search windows help for "Setting up wireless connection" and follow them.  <br>  <br>  Typically the only reason why you need to use an ISPs software is when you are wired directly to the modem and need to send username and password to them to "log into" the service.  Most of the time the device connected to the DSL modem is configured to pass these parameters so you do not really need the ISPs software.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MZ1DRSflaa	What make & model of DSL modem?

Siapa tau bisa lebih bantu.|`|N4iM3kj9aa	Wah ini sih saran dari gw.coba lu download ansav..<br>  programnya kecil t..cari aja di search engine....|`|eXItVekKaa	hahahahahawhaha sori gak maksud ngejek ato jatoin mental lu cat.. mestinya yg kena begitu gua ya.. kualat ma onta-onta.<br>  <br>  kalo gua pribadi pake AVG 7.5, keliatannya seh mantep. gua sendiri kurang tau sampe segimana bedanya. tapi temen nerd gua rekomen ini.<br>  <br>  kapan ke forum A K lg cat? ane tunggu ya|`|3ewNbE6faa	haha lo kualat tuh mka nya jgn ngejek mlu, sorry gw ga mksud ldkin lo cat coba lo instal ulung n pke avg 7.5 siapatau mempan non lo jgn pe nyebarin virus ma kta2 yg baik n gakan kualat hehehe|`|5Q3WP7T6aa	lo harus up grade com lo dari awal lagi|`|9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  <br>  Sayangnya anda tidak menyebutkan detail virus tersebut.<br>  <br>  Jika virus tersebut berasal dari luar negeri, pakailah anti-virus dari luar negeri juga. Jika dari Indonesia, pakailah anti-virus dari Indonesia.<br>  <br>  Anti-virus terbaik dari Indonesia sampai saat ini ialah Ansav +B 32.<br>  <br>  Download di <a href="http://www.spectre.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.spectre.co.nr</a><br>  <br>  See ya..|`|QtFu0ewIaa	antivirusnya musti di update terus<br>  <br>  kalo gak bener jg drpd nyerang yg lain2<br>  bawa ke t4 service sekalian<br>  aman|`|zx8tnTcyaa	Cara Pertama : Pake AVG 7.5, dengan update terbaru, dijamin virus indonesia pun bisa dibabat habis.<br>  <br>  cara kedua, rada-rada teknis :<br>  1. Hapus semua cookies dan Temporary Internet Files.<br>  caranya, buka explorer, masuk ke    folder C:\Documents and Settings\,<br>  buka satu persatu folder yang ada (Folder-folder tersebut merupakan daftar user), anda akan menemukan folder <br>  Local Settings. Nah di dalam folder Local settings tersebut terdapat folder Cookies dan Temporary Internet Files. Hapus semua file dalam kedua folder tersebut, tapi ingat, foldernya jangan jangan dihapus.<br>  <br>  2. Jika Aplikasi MSWord atau MSExcel Anda terasa berat saat dijalankan, kemungkinan virus tersebut sudah menanamkan dirinya ke dalam aplikasi tersebut. Sebaiknya diinstal ulang.<br>  <br>  3. aktifkan Task Manager, Pilih Tab Process, matikan semua proses yang user namenya selain system. Jika Task Manager tidak aktif, Anda bisa gunakan program Procexp yang dapat didownload gratis dari internet (saya lupa alamatnya, gunakan saja search engine).<br>  <br>  4. Gunakan fasilitas search, lakukan pencarian file-file berikut ini :<br>  SVCSHOT.EXE, SYSTEM.EXE, WINLOGON.EXE, SMSS.EXE, SERVICES.EXE pada folder C:\Documents and Settings dan semua sub foldernya, hapus semua file tersebut.<br>  <br>  5. Biasanya file tersebut tidak dapat dihapus manual, karena itu cobalah untuk booting dengan mode safe (safe mode) kemudian coba untuk hapus.

Thats the best way for an ammature who doesnt know too much about it. Or you can reinstall your operating system if you still have the vista disc. (recommend you know what your doing with that one) :)|`|dqxbmT1Vaa	remove the harddisk  then put the system in to reset up|`|rQ5eWEuHaa	Well, the best thing to do would be if you still have the disks that came with the computer that contain the operating system and all the basics, then use those disks to delete the current portion, and reinstall the original things. If not, then you may want to call HP and see if they will provide those disks for you.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Tap F11 on boot this should bring you to your recovery manager, say no to running a restore your next option will be the recovery, run the recovery it'll take about an hour and a half.|`|hNww9g80aa	Choose System Recovery/Advanced Options/Destructive Recovery will reformat the hard drive to factory state.

If you balanced a checkbook then uninstall that financial software.  Pull up Internet Explorer and click on Tools - Internet Options - delete browsing history like cookies, websites you visited.  Then go after personal documents that you might have written.  If you used Microsoft Outlook then delete your email account.  And I would grab someone that knows computers rather than doing it yourself.<br>  <br>  Do not listen to those who tell you to download some software that wipes out your entire hard drive then reinstall windows.  You did not use it that much. You probably can not find the disks to reinstall windows let alone the product keys.  If you never entered a bank information, never shopped online, never used Microsoft Outlook for email, never started a personal journal, only surfed websites regarding nursing, facebook, newspapers then then who cares if you surfed online for a recipe for possum pie.<br>  <br>  I have pulled PCs out of dumpsters and got them working again.  One was a manager at a nearby manufacturing company that had two folders for his employees.  One folder was named White and the other folder had a pretty naughty name for it. I could have caused trouble for him.  I decided to delete all of his personal stuff...after I read everything.|`|33e79616630df0b6aeb5570809760200aa	basic terms when you reformat means that you will clean everything and delete everything of the hard drive which means you will also delete the Operating system. also in order to reformat you will need an XP CD or a VISTA CD to reinstall a computer remember that once you reformat you will delete everything from a computer!!!
jcuKYc6saa	well, in the case that you do get a virus, a firewall is supposed to stop it from connecting to the internet and downloading other nasty things to your computer.  what the firewall does is stands between your computer and the internet, kind of like a cop does for criminals and society, and if something tries to do something bad, it stops it (in theory).  dont get Avast! or AVG, go with Eset Smart Security.  it comes with Antivirus and Firewall.  <a href="http://zlailer.googlepages.com/esetguide" rel="nofollow">http://zlailer.googlepages.com/esetguide</a> has all the instructions you need to get this product up and running.  email me if you have any questions.  nismith8@gmail.com|`|biZRtdqzaa	avast isnt as good as avg trust me, ive used both, avast has a bit higher detection rate but speed sucks, your windows firewall should bee enough. use avg, less on system resources. but if u dont like it and your convinced i recomend bitdefender free edition.|`|Z49hyPfgaa	Most video games require you to turn off the firewall, maybe that's it?

You can then paste this image into other applications just like any other image that you copied, and pasted.

7nimzIDsaa	Like the other posters suggest you can only go either SLi or Crossfire, there is no hybrid SLi-CF scenario. Like wise you have to match nVidia cards for SLi and ATi Radeons for Crossfire. That is the distinctions between the green and red camp. <br>  <br>  Btw For ATi if you possess a 680G onwards chipset motherboard and if your have an onboard graphic chip, you can do a hybrid crossfire with a dedicated ATi Radeon card.<br>  <br>  Since you have the advantage of having already an 8800GT which i believe has SLi support. I would suggest you buy another 8800GT prices should have depreciated greatly by now.<br>  <br>  Do take note if you board supports SLi, It must be an nForce SLi chipset motherboard or Intel's X58 which i don't think is your current configuration.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	What you are talking about doing is called SLI or Crossfire. In order to do either one you need 2 identical cards. EX. 2 8800 gt's. If you buy another 8800 gt you could SLI them if your mother board supports SLI. But with only a 500W power supply you would also have to upgrade that to at least a 650W min. I hope this helped.|`|33e79616630df0b6aeb5570809760200aa	yeah you can though add another one just go to either tigerdirect.com or newegg.com and you can find good graphics card at the right and good price so i suggest you do that but yes you can have another graphics card if you want.|`|wI5bhnuBaa	Not a good idea at all, since they each require two different graphics drivers.  It can be done but I don't think it's worth it.|`|cJypdHvbaa	just to let you know its "Radeon" ok but thats not a big deal. probably not because they are manufactured by two different companies. (ATI and Nvidia) and they both have different settings. i think when you have 2 GeForce cards working together they call it SLI Mode. and When its Two ATI cards, or Radeons, they call it crossfire. and make sure your processor can handle two cards anyway.<br>  so nope, you can only run 2 of the same GPU in SLI or Crossfire, but you can't if they aren't similar enough and of course not if they arent the same brand. hope this helps :) coming from geek boy "ksidornseif"|`|7aqEtfLRaa	Nope, you can run 2 of the same GPU in SLI or Crossfire, but you can't if they're not similar enough, and definatly not if they're not even the same brand.

7nimzIDsaa	Partitions are not necessary however i will recommend them as  in case of a drive failure all you have to do is just format that drive and not the entire hard disk. Personally i have lots of photos and data that i wanna preserve, so it would be best if i back it up to another drive, just in case windows failed on me.<br>  <br>  My recommended allocation will be:<br>  <br>  C: - 250 GB -> boot your o/s here<br>  D: - 300 GB / 681.5 GB -> storage<br>  E: - 381.5 GB -> storage (can be omitted if the rest of the space is allocated to D:)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CXH8yOiraa	You dont have to partition it, although it is very highly recommended that you do. Your hard drive will perform better when partitioned.<br>  You should create a partition for your OS, then maybe another for games, and the rest for data.|`|cJypdHvbaa	well it will run better if you do, maybe have part for games, part for software, and part for games? the rest for data. but yes, it works better with partitions.
AA11622701	If your computer displays to a monitor, then you have a "video card".  It is just build into the system board rather than being a separate card.  Usually those are MORE reliable that a separate card.<br>  <br>  Before you decide the video card is bad, I would try a different monitor.  That sounds more like a bad voltage regulator in the monitor itself, or a break somewhere in the cable between the monitor and the PC.orrow one for a day from a friend (or take yours to their house and have them try it.)<br>  <br>  If a different monitor does not help, then you can consider installing a secondary video card.  Many people do that because usually the separate video cards have better specs then the build in cards (if you are a gamer).  But that will not help if the monitor is bad.|`|b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	No.<br>  Many PCs work fine with the video card integrated on the motherboard (like yours).<br>  <br>  The problem is elsewhere. <br>  Make sure that the monitor cable is properly connected. <br>  Jiggle it a little ... if that is what's causing the problem then either the cable is defective or the VGA connector on the motherboard.<br>  <br>  regards,<br>  Philip T|`|ywYj0nQraa	I'm pretty positive that a video card is what displays everything on a monitor, so you have to have one.

There are laptops with much better processors now (centrino 2 technology instead of centrino) and better graphics cards.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	There are NO PROs for a Dell computer, they just plain SUK. Here we go:  Macs are easy and now you can get a Dual Processor that does Windows also. No other computer can make that statement. A MacBook 2.4, 4 Gigs Ram will do the trick for you. Lightweight and is a Heavyweight in performance.  With Apple Stores usually close by it's easy way to get your computer fixed if it's a minor problem. They usually do right on the spot. With Dell in particular you have to send it to them [at your cost] and wait for at least 2 weeks to get it back. Almost no one will work on a Dell so Dell's got you. If you take the time to check Dell's website everyday you will see the same model computer configured slightly different and with a different price. Deceptive to say the least. Hope this helps you make a decision no matter which computer you buy. <br>  Here's why you should get a Mac:: There are NO CONS. The MacBook does both WinBloze and OSX, no other computer can make that statement. You have the best of the best. Apple Stores are popping up all over and you can make an appointment for a time and date, bring your computer there. They will troubleshoot it and fix it if it's a software problem it's FREE. What other computer company has stores and can make that statement? Get the 2.4 GHz with 4Gigs Ram and you got a speed machine like mine. The WinBloze people may not like a Mac computer but I'll bet they all have iPods. Go Mac and Never Go Back.|`|1q8KGffEaa	it is good , actually all dell laptops are awesome

y6JjyHCtaa	Next to all the user names in your contact list you'll see either..<br>  <br>  Offline: little grey x in a white cirlce<br>  Logged in but not active: orange clock<br>  Green circle: online and looking at mail<br>  <br>  These icons will allow you to see who is online so you can chat with that person through gmail. If you are like me, you log in and check your mail and never log out like you are "supposed to". After probably 5min of no activity on the gmail account (but they are still logged in because they forgot to log off) the green circle will become an orange clock. Then probably 30-60min after that it will become a white circle with grey x because they were automatically logged out by gmail for no activity.<br>  <br>  So if you see an orange clock that means they recently check their mail :) ORRRR they have a mobile device that is tied to their gmail account and it will always be on.

It should work, but always be safe and check on your power supply unit.<br>  <br>  PSUs should tell you about the current and voltage. You work out the power:<br>  <br>  Power (Watts) = Current (Amps) * Voltage (Volts)<br>  <br>  But fear not; power supplies are mostly standardised internationally.

So unless your motherboard has an expansion slot (PCI-Express slot) you pretty much wont be able to upgrade. <br>  <br>  It all depends on what you will be using the PC for.  For regular use, the HD3200 will be more then enough, youll even be able to watch HD DVD.

The only studies that ever said otherwise were done by Dvorak himself, and nobody else has been able to repeat his results.<br>  <br>  You will find lots of people selling you Dvorak keyboards explaining that Dvorak is 20% more efficient or 25% more efficient. You will see lots of arguments why it should cause less strain. What you will not find are actual studies showing that it is in fact more efficient, allowing people to type faster or with less repetitive motion strain. And it is not because people have not tried to prove it.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Most people are just used to QWERTY.  Besides, it doesn't need to be 100% effective to still be fast.  Even if you learn DVORAK, 99.999% of all computers are QWERTY so you'd have to use QWERTY anyway.

So when fitting all of the memory and devices into a 32-bit address range: not all of the available 4GB of address space can be given over to memory.<br>  <br>  The actual amount of available memory typically ranges from 3.2GB to 3.8GB, depending on your exact hardware configuration.   I do not believe there are any patches that can change that.|`|uFIFC51zaa	32 bit only supports upto 3.25gb of RAM, if you want anymore than that, then i would suggest getting the 64bit.

So you don't need to install SP2.|`|JdoySaaBaa	Its a boot problem, may be the plugs..may be the hard drive...may be the cd dvd rom drive............If you could still log on to your sp3 installation....try to run a registry fix utility, defragging the existing operating system (sp3) could ease up boot time.  Do check the plugs connected to your hard drive.

dkpIjt5jaa	Here is how to do more precise research to find the best one for YOU: The first step is to get information on the laptops that you are interested in and, as a second step, to search online at web stores (like Amazon or similar) or at retail shops (BestBuy, staples or similar) for the best deals on the ones you would really like to have based on your search.<br>  <br>  This way, you get the best working laptops at the best prices.<br>  <br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your research.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Here's why you should get a Mac:: There are NO CONS.

What other computer company has stores and can make that statement? Get the 2.4 GHz with 4Gigs Ram and you got a speed machine like mine.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  conflicts. I have never strayed away from 9.47 -- and lots of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

fc77a866e635617e01c610e44fc41f33aa	Short answer: yes.<br>  <br>  Long answer: it depends. The heat will affect motherboard differently. Normally, they damage components in multiple ways, normally by shortening their expected life span. If you're motherboard runs too hot (and the interior of your casing too), you'll damage your CPU, hard drives, memory, and the motherboard itself.<br>  <br>  I've seen situations where the life span of components was shortened to 6-12 months after the overheat incident.<br>  <br>  However, every components have different levels of heat sensitivity. You might be lucky and have components that can handle higher heats.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|9f24acea3f336390fe645178a492cd73aa	I don't have any sources personally to back my comments up so maybe others have a better view on this... From personal experience, motherboards can take quite a bit of heat, I know my laptop when under heavy loads runs at 85C (for a few seconds at a time) which is extremely hot, probably hotter than yours, and my motherboard is fine. I would say if all the stuff on your motherboard is working (USBs, CD-ROMS, hard drives, audio cables, etc) then your motherboard is fine... but get some cooling ;-)|`|FygQdyDnaa	Possible but not likely most heavy heat parts such as your processor can run stable at 60 degrees Centigrade or even up to 70 degrees if not higher for some chips. the part more likely to be damaged by heat is your processor since the heat is being directly generated by it. Since your computer is working I would say more than Likly nothing has been damaged. <br>  <br>  Also the heat sink should be fairly hot from dissipating heat<br>  <br>  One thing which might help your heat problem (on the CPU) is to take off your fan/heatsink from the CPU and check to see if the thermal Paste is dried out if it is  go out to a radio shack or another major computer part store like fry;s or tiger direct (b/c most best buys won't have it) and get a $3-6 think of arctic silver 5 or thermal paste.<br>  <br>  However if it the mother board getting hot not just the heat sink yeah go for the new case since it isn't good for the other parts either.|`|SnZJsp51aa	Try Turning On the Computer, If you see the P.O.S.T (Power On Self Test), or anything on your screen, then that means it wasn't damaged, but still you should run a diagnostic test on your motherboard just to be sure. Then If it all goes well, try installing Windows on it like XP, then if everything works out and you get to this point. Then Go ahead buy that new case. Also a tip, do a diagnostic test once a year, and also open up your computer and clean the dust so you can extend your computer's lifespan.

fE7zhp3Caa	It's possible that the laptop's BIOS setting for integrated USB support defaults to USB 1.1 instead of USB 2.0.  Given the laptop's age, it could make sense.<br>  <br>  And as the person above answered, replacing a laptop's CMOS battery is usually an expensive, overly complicated endeavor requiring at least a partial disassembly, soldering out the old battery, soldering in the new, and reassembling.|`|vL2Ec50Yaa	The laptop does have its own cmos battery which is far different than the ones on the desktop motherboards.<br>  <br>  If he wishes to correct this problem, he will need a qualified technician to go in and replace it.  It will probably run about $100 here in the states.  The main cost will be in the cost of disassembling the laptop and putting it back together.  That is, if the battery is in a difficult place to get at.  Not all laptops are made the same.  Just look at the placement of the hard drives now compared to a few years ago where you had to take off the palm rest & keyboard to remove the drive.<br>  <br>  On this older unit, replacing the cmos battery could be expensive, if the part is even available.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
fE7zhp3Caa	Windows itself can only run so fast.  Given that it's own resource requirements are so much lower than any of the games you've mentioned, it was probably already running as fast as it could.<br>  <br>  Windows Explorer isn't exactly a demanding, multiprocessing-heavy application.  However, should you open several windows simultaneously and run a few searches at the same time, you'll probably push things hard enough to make more use of the extra cores.  But you'd probably need a few dozen going at the same time.<br>  <br>  One thing that concerns me about your PC details is that for both you describe your motherboard as 'of little importance'.  I hope you're only joking.|`|8pCEUa3Zaa	32 bit os will only recgnize 3 gig  64 bit runs considerably better and recognizes all memory.|`|aAH0SuLCaa	internet explorer is only as fast as your isp allows. your computer is fine. nice machine by the way|`|EDyBnXB2aa	Internet explorer depends on your internet, I can tell you a few things.. To check if your computer is running fast, rapidly open a bunch of internet explorer applications, and see how your computer runs, and see how much of your CPU gets used up. 4 cores is good, but you got to remember, your motherboard has a huge role, and you also got to remember AMD isn't the best CPU out there, yes it is the Phenom 2 Quad-Core, which is amazing, but still nothing compared to even the Q9400. Which at this moment is top rated for its price. But the motherboard really has a huge part, make sure its compatible with your GFX card and processor. Good luck.|`|9UFgpreeaa	It's Internet Explorer.<br>  <br>  Mozilla.com go there and download firefox.<br>  <br>  Internet explorer was best at number 4-6, they ruined it.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	I see people don't know the difference between windows explorer and Internet explorer but the <br>  Simple answer that needs little thinking about you have wasted money <br>  <br>  Reasons <br>  Windows xp, vista are 32bit operating systems <br>  Windows application software is 32bit to get the benefit out of a 64bit system you need 64bit operating system and 64bit application software  <br>  <br>  Nuff said, you are running 32 bit systems on a 64bit machine Games run under windows protected DOS mode that's why they run fast and great|`|XlyLakYAaa	Well, the thing is you're not going to notice any speed increase in mundane tasks as they were already fast before (or limited by something else, like hard drive reads).<br>  <br>  It's like if you traded in your car for a Ferrari.

When it opens you need to scroll to the page which asks what drive you wish to boot from, it will have HDD, CD drive, floppy disc if you have one installed, or maybe a removable disc, anyway, select HDD 1 save the changes, close and start your PC normally and it should be OK.|`|f7jICJo2aa	I'm not sure what you mean.

I would turn on the computer, put my Operating System cd into the cdrom and reboot the system - booting to the cd. It will eventually give you an option where you can tell it to 'repair'. Click repair. Eventually you will get to a command prompt. When you do, type chkdsk /r and hit enter. Note: there is a space between the k and the /<br>  <br>  Hard drives develop bad sectors after a period of time. By running this check disk program, it will try to correct and mark the bad sectors and move the information off of those spots onto good sectors of the hard drive.<br>  If this doesn't take care of the problem, it could be a ram problem. Remove each stick of ram, insert one then turn the computer on. If that doesn't work, remove that one and insert the other one.<br>  Another thing you can check is if it is overheating.  Make sure that the laptop can breathe properly - blow the dust out  of the fan and the vent holes.  If dust bunnies collect in and around the heatsink, the unit will have to be taken apart to clean it properly... which is something that is beyond the scope of the normal laptop user to do, and you should find a tech to complete the task.<br>  <br>  Hope that you're able to rectify your problem.

edPeEGzmaa	It all looks good. I just scanned over your shopping cart but everything looks to be compatible with each other. Nice build btw, that's a good price for all of the stuff you're putting into it. And only $11 for shipping? Seriously? That's an amazing deal.<br>  <br>  As for building your own PC, it's extremely straight forward. As long as you have a limited knowledge of what connectors go where and how to wire your power and reset buttons to your motherboard (it should come with a diagram telling you where to place the jumper) then you'll be set. <br>  <br>  MAKE SURE that you wear an anti-static wristband that is clipped to a metal part of your computer's chassis whenever handling the components. Many people that build computers and think that they received faulty products more often then not actually fried them thanks to carelessness when handling them. Don't let that be you.<br>  <br>  Building your own system is rewarding though, far better value in custom PCs and it expands your knowledge of computers. After building your first PC you shouldn't have any more worries afterwards, and will look forward to messing around inside of your case. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Then from your home page you would create a link like  <br>  <a href="full-path-to/january-minutes.html" target="_blank">January Minutes</a>.<br>  <br>  Note: full-path-to  be sure to include the full path i.e. if it is in another folder  or if it is in the same folder then you only need the file name.<br>  The target="_blank" will open the document in new window so your home page does not get lost.  Readers simply close the 'minutes' window to return to the home page.<br>  <br>  To save a little time each month once you create your 'minutes.html' page you can reuse the same page and just change the included info each month.  Simply delete the minutes from january and put in february's minutes then save as "february.html".

jGgOVd5Zaa	Mbps and Kbps stand for Megabits per second and kilobits per second.  The 50 MB file is 50 Megabytes.  There are 8 bits in a byte (it's one of those silly binary things).  I'm not sure how your internet connection can be both 1.5 Mbps/256 Kbps at the same time.  At 1.5 Mbps a 50 MB download should take between a 3-4 minutes.  (There are 400 bits in 50 MB divided by 1.5= 267 seconds) but your internet speed will very a little from second to second and the speed the server you are downloading from with affect it too.

I have had some success with this approach.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Run scandisk and choose the "surface scan" option. Formatting only overwrites a small portion, the system area, of the drive, whereas the surface scan tests all areas, the system area AND the data area. Once you have done the surface scan, any bad sectors will be marked as such and excluded for the sectors that can be used. You may need to reinstall windoze to recover from the damaged files, IF that is what the problem IS, of course. It is RARE for many sectors to go bad, but it does happen. Usually you see nothing happening. IDE drives are doing error checking in the backgropund, in essence testing each sector by doing a read after write and comparing the results.,. If there is a mismatch, it writes a second time, and a third and if it fails the error check a third time, it is marked as bad and the system then tries to read and write the next available sector. There is NO error message or anything to tell you a sector failed in this manner. The only time you get an error message is when you go to read from a sector and it is not readable, in which case you get a "not ready" message or a "drive not available" message or if in a command window, an error reading file message which offers a choice to "abort, retry, or fail". So, I suggest you reformat, run scandisk with the surface test option turned ON and then install windoze again.

The reason why it has to be at the very TOP of the CSS list.<br>  <br>  This will keep you from having to type in all those "border="0"" attributes for every image tag as some people do instead of styling the tag with no border.<br>  <br>  Ron|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Well, coupla things.<br>  <br>  Firstly, it displays o.k. in IE but not in Firefox.

AA11780191	I know exactly what you mean.  A lot of people use Facebook to set up a mirror of the same popularity contests in high school, college, etc.  But Facebook isn't really *anything*.  It can be used just as you want it to be used.  That said, unless you've got some annoying 'friends' on FB right now, there's no harm in leaving it as is. But... since it sounds like you're really interested in putting behind your old life when you head off to college.  No problem.<br>  <br>  Set up another account.  But then change your privacy settings with the new account so that only friends or friends of friends can see your profile or search for you.  This allows you to maintain this new, separate identity with the old one intact or not.<br>  <br>  Other people might go with the simpler solution of just deleting the old profile and starting anew.  But if you've got close friends associated with your old profile, do you really want them to go away?<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd avoid all the hassle and just stick with the one original profile.  But I'm a few years out of college and I came to really aprecciate my past way more now than I did back then.  Hope this helps more than confuses.  :)|`|auV1uN6Zaa	Delete and don't remake it|`|ueFv8uXKaa	Well if you dont want to have your old friends on there and if you want to start fresh just delete that facebook. And if you make a new one they will probably find you again and try to add you so you will just have the same problem.

73250ff641e2c3cc52bb285aea5f1d3daa	The configuration of your network should be this:<br>  <br>  Both desktops must connect to the router via Ethernet.(on the desktops, it's the LAN or Ethernet port, while on the router should be ports 1,2,3, or 4.) Then, you need to connect the router to the modem using Ethernet cable. The port on the router should say "Internet", and the modem port should say "LAN". Connect those together, and set up a network manually by each computer. <br>  <br>  As for the IP Addresses, set it to automatically find the address. The problem may lie within that the router doesn't know your Internet connection's Primary and Secondary DNS addresses(those addresses are located at your ISP, assigning WAN addresses to modems. Then the modem will give the information to the router, then which the local DNS server onboard the router will assign local addresses to each computer(like 192.168.1.101). But for the WAN address, each computer will have the same one.|`|8pCEUa3Zaa	just because you plug the one with internet to the one that doesn't it does not mean that both will miraculously have internet.

69Jcu8Ufaa	I think it should be fine.  Since you're using a tablet, though, I'd keep it hooked up to an outlet because as you probably already guessed video editing is very taxing on a computer.  Also, I'm not too sure about the video card.  I don't know a whole lot about Radeon video cards but according to this one site I was looking at, it may have a hard time playing games like Doom 3 and Quake 4 (both games that came out a couple years ago).  I realize you're not asking about playing games, but both media editing and game playing tend to require the most resources  from your computer.  Good luck!
vBWw77Ydaa	upgrade to myspace 2.0, then you can go to customize profile and drag the comment module to near the top.<br>  <br>  In myspace 1.0  it is not necessarily impossible, but the code that works will not be the same for every profile.<br>  <br>  And any code you do use, is likely to have cross-platform/browser issues, unless you have very little content on your profile.<br>  The content does not all size the same, so getting positioning correct is tedious (and sometimes not even reasonable).<br>  <br>  The concept of just placing the entire comment section module, using absolute placement works only if you know the exact size of your comment section, or don't mind having lots of extra space, or maybe overlapping, as soon as a new comment is left.<br>  The chances that your comments are this static is small.<br>  <br>  Using relative movement, assumes that the distance from the location to the point you want your comments, is static in size.<br>  This is also not usually the case.  There are cross browser sizing differences.  Even in this case, you would need to know how much space to allocate for your comments.<br>  <br>  So not impossible, but getting code that you don't have to constantly tweak and change may be impossible (depending on your profile).

AA10666760	Yes there are computers like that. I gotta say, that the speed of the download will depend more on your internet connection than the computer. Why don't you give us a price range (edit your question in the "add details" section) and we can find something decent for you?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Try the Dell Vostro 1510, here: <a href="http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=bqcw51z&c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&kc=productdetails~vostronb_1510" rel="nofollow">http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/c...</a> . It has a dual-core CPU, 2 gigs of RAM, a 250-gig hard drive, a DVD burner, Vista Home Basic--for $479.  <br>  <br>  That's a pretty good deal. Its at Dell's small business site--you don't need to own a business to buy there. I'd treat these numbers as a minimum (except for the 250 gig hard drive--you might not need that much). With Vista, you should not go below a dual core, or 2 gigs of RAM. Vista will need that much.|`|APmvDEPlaa	Speed of download/internet has pretty much nothing to do on the laptop, if you want fast internet, get a fast internet connection.

I'll help you quickly before I go to bed!!!<br>  <br>  Your computer needs formatting.  It may have viruses and the only way to really cure them completely is to erase the entire HDD, your local pc world does this for 50 quid I think?  Or so I've heard.<br>  <br>  Second.  MSN is well known for being hacked.  Your account has been hacked and someone has logged in, as you, and sent your friends messages pretending to be you.  Change your password to solve this.  If you get a message from a friend telling you that they need to go to this website etc etc they have probably had there msn comprimised.  Ask them to change there password too.  NEVER put your passwords into a website unless you trust it 100%<br>  <br>  :op|`|3S0cAy6Yaa	yea its a virus it happens a lot just explain to people that it is a common virus on msn  and that theres not much you can do about it DO NOT CLICK ON LINKS this is how you got the virus someone has sent you a link and you have downloaded a smart virus that has passed your security. run a virus check throughout your whole computer if you do not have an anti virus download this <a href="http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...</a> its free and its pretty good. also a good idea to change your password and ask your friends to repeat these steps.
xGTXUFtiaa	The answer is no, because 3-way Crossfire means 3 GPU's, not 3 cards.  The x2 cards have 2 GPUs each.

pArnzgmXaa	Work for everything you want for.  It makes it more gratifying when you can finally make the purchase you worked so hard for.  As a side note, don't let other people sway you into thinking one platform is better than the other.

THere is no way to make quick money, especially with the economy what it currently is.<br>  <br>  Also, I'd recommend you *seriously* consider getting another kind of laptop.  Macs are WAY overpriced and simply not worth it in my opinion.  I'd also like to emphasize that I used the word "overpriced" instead of "expensive" because "expensive" sometimes implies that you're paying more money for a better product.  This is NOT the case with a Mac as you're really just wasting money buying virtually the same product as a PC.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	It is a wireless network adapter. It can come in a variety of form factors. A "mini card" is not a standard term for any of the form factors I know of. PCMCIA is about the size of a credit card and about 5 times as thick with an edge connector which is a socket for 2 rows of pins. Next, is a "compact flash" form factor, which is similar to the PCMCIA and just as thick with 2 rows of socket pins, but smaller than a credit card by a third. The CF form factor requires an adapter to use in a PCMCIA slot. Last that I know of is the SD memory card form factor which looks just like a SD memory card and plugs into the same slot as the memory card does in something like a Pocket PC. Again, the SD form factor needs an adapter to fit a CF or PCMCIA slot.|`|bfAr3Fj5aa	A wireless card that uses the mini PCI interface I would think.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect#Mini_PCI" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_...</a>

I would suggest first adding the free Google Web Analytics on your blog. Also, go to google webmaster tools and verify your site, this will show you how googlebot sees your site.  Do some keyword research for the topics that you are discussing on your blog, the best keyword research tool is Wordtracker. Don't just write about everything and anything. Try to pick a niche and be the best resource for a particular topic or category. Learn about search engine marketing and search engine optimization, google those phrases. Make good landing pages, an excellent resource is MarketingExperiments.com. The most important thing is to write quality content, that is, that your blogs have unique content (not copied from anywhere), that it's informative and interesting to read, making people read it and that you pick a niche topic, like a blog all about buying classic cars, for instance, all the google ads should be about sites advertising classic cars. This is how you will get the most traffic and clicks to the ads. Pick a niche topic that really interests you that way you can write about it alot and never tire of it. Do your research on your niche topic , by googling your topic and go to a bookstore or library and take notes on your topic so you can write quality content. Quality content is the most important factor if you want to write a blog and get lots of clicks to ads.|`|ER542ktkaa	The same as me.

ZOIanxRAaa	Right now I'm using the q6600. When I Originally was adding more Arctic Silver 5 (AS5) I didn't have my fan all the way on, and it was a little side ways running ~85c. First, make sure that the 4 pins are turned clock-wise (the opposite direction the arrows are pointing). Then make sure that all four pins are pressed down, If you do not have the cpu fan in all the way, the system can be much higher than normal. Also, make sure that the logo (says "Intel" on the fan you get for free) is not sideways. You can still put the fan-in, but the power-cpu-fan-chord will have lots of excessive chord. The first time I started my computer with just the pad It was at ~35c idle ~60c load w/ AS5 it's ~40c idle and ~50c load. That's what my stats are.<br>  On the bio set "smart fan : on"<br>  If smart fan is off; then it'll be lower temp, but it's going to be louder noise until computer turns off / hibernates... and it's only going to be about 3c cooler on idle, so smart fan is much better; as it'll still be going fast once you get higher temps.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps

FqLR9CUJaa	Umm... let me make this simple:<br>  <br>  im gonna purchase a netbook soon and was wondering how can i install the cd for isp when theres no disc drive. not planning to get an external drive. <br>  <br>  -> you can copy the contents of the CD on a flash drive and plug it in.<br>  <br>  i heard yu can share files on the main computer through a network and connect to that network via netbook thus acessing the isp. i dont plan to connect the netbook to the net with ethernet obviously.<br>  <br>  --> you can but it would be a bit complicated.  The main computer needs to have a wireless modem or wireless that is connected to a wireless router if you're not going to use ethernet.  But point is, if you have a wireless router, you won't be needing to connect to the main computer.<br>  <br>  BUTT .. i was curious .. issit really necessary ? i mean netbook can access the network therefore allowing the use of the internet. am i correct ?<br>  <br>  --> I didn't get what you mean.  <br>  <br>  but then again i got a wireless modem with a usb modem. if the netbooks can detect the network. whats with the usb modem ? or "must" i use the usb modem because it more secure?faster? more beneficial ? if so how ?<br>  <br>  --> Not sure what you mean.  If you have wireless then use wireless.  There is no benefit between wired and wireless (unless your area has very bad reception or too many interference).<br>  <br>  sorry to hassle ya guys if i did but if you can help its much appreciated. thank youu<br>  <br>  --> no problem

5EUMi3xjaa	Some of my answers might be biased because I have personal preferences. Ok here we go,<br>  First things first, I would not recommend an LG drive. They tend to be cheap but die fast.<br>  As of late, AMD is lagging behind so your intel idea will work better.<br>  For the video card I prefer an Nvidia card. If you get one from EVGA you will be able to trade it in later on if you decide to upgrade.<br>  The best hard drive brands are Western Digital and Seagate.<br>  Also pay attention to speed of the hard drive, nothing less than 7200rpm<br>  I suggest you get two hard drives, one for operating system, one for files, that way if you choose to reinstall your operating system at one point there will be no need to make backups of the files, and if your OS gets corrupted the files wont be lost.<br>  the brands for memory, I prefer A-Data and Patriot, they haven't failed on me once. 2x2gb will probably work best.<br>  power supply depends on how much stuff will be wired in. I have a Intel q6600 an optical drive, 2 hard drive, 6 fans, and a GTX 260 and it runs fine with a 550watt power supply. If you go with a high end card, the power requirement will increase. Always look at the power requirements posted by the manufacturer of the GPU, since GPUs drink most power.<br>  There isn't really a universal formula of how many fans, it all depends on the case size and design and what you are going to have in there. I will however suggest that you get high quality after market cooler for your CPU because stock one is rarely adequate. And don't use thermal paste sheets attached to CPU coolers, wipe that off and apply Arctic Cool thermal paste.

Make sure you get a motherboard with aslot for the video card.  <br>  <br>  Make sure that your motherboard comes with a utility disc or that you download all of the drivers.  <br>  <br>  Then you need a case, a hard drive that matches (IDE or SATA), a power supply,  a  PCIe 2.0 @ x16  video card with at least 512MB of RAM, and don't forget the miscellaneous cables to connect the hard drive and the disc drive.|`|DkNYsJ9Maa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Congrats It good to have a new System, please find out the list to make your Won system with brand names,<br>  <br>  <br>  Processor : Inter Core2Duo / AMD <br>  Motherboard : Asus / GIGABYTE Which Help's u to support HD<br>  RAM : 2 GB x 2 = 4GB  Hynix / Samsung / Hundai<br>  Harddisk : Better u go to 1TB of Samsung / Segate (any comp 5 years)<br>  Cabinet: Depend up on your Choice<br>  CD-DRIVE: Bluray / LG/ Samsung<br>  Keyboard/Mouse : Microsoft  / Logitech<br>  Power Supply will Come with your cabnet<br>  Graphice Card 1GB Radeon HD<br>  Monitor : 22" Full HD Support, Viewsonic/ Samsung/ LG<br>  <br>  So start to make your won pc & enjoy the HD world|`|IvUj2A47aa	jam's pretty much got it covered. "Corsair XMS2 xtreme performance 2x2GB" is pretty good, and I'd go with the 4870. Try to get a aluminium case as it keeps your computer cooler. Have a 120mm fan blowing air out at the back, one 80/120mm blowing in on the side, and 1 or 2 120mm blowing in from the front. 550w is good, but get maybe a 650W.

To find it, just go to the e-mail program you used, find the file name for the attachment on the e-mail, and then go to (assuming you have Windows) the start menu, and do a file search and type in the name of the file, or a part of the name with asterisks at the beginning and end.

One easy way is to put this between the head tags of your pages:<br>  <br>  <base href="http://www.geocities.com/kcapel77/...<br>  <br>  then all images will be called from the images folder no matter what the relationship is of the page needing them.<br>  <br>  Ron|`|XL9bTbANaa	lol, Ok the thing is, instead of the basic html coding you have "src="../../../Program Files/CoffeeCup Software/Working/landscaping3.jpg"" instead of "/images/landscaping3.jpg"  if the photos are uploaded into the folder named "images" make sure you change ALL the sources that are 'src="/Program Files/CoffeeCup Software/Working/"' to src="/images/___.___"instead of the whole hullabaloo you got going there.|`|ERYT1ylraa	Use the Website TINYPIC to post your Pics..<br>  <br>  This will be valuable for you as it will give you different code and formats for you to use and post your pics.

6Djqii7Xaa	CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide on Silicon) memory is used to hold the configuration for your computer. When your computer starts up, it goes into this memory and uses the characters stored in there to perform a calculation and checks this calculation called a cheksum with the value that it is supposed to be, which is also stored. This is to check to see if the memory has become corrupted. In your case it has become corrupted. In order for you to be able to use your computer, it loads up a set of "default" values, which is what was there when the computer was built.<br>  <br>  This memory is kept alive by a battery on your motherboard. If the battery goes dead, then you will get this error. Try replacing the battery. The first time you reboot after that, you will get the error again. The next time, it should be OK. If this doesn't work, you have more serious problems with the motherboard.|`|NTM822AZaa	it means that something in your bios is not configured correctly, if it is a late model computer check if FDD is enabled and disable it|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	"The most common cause of checksum errors in CMOS is a battery that is losing power.

Malwarebytes can be installed alongside your anti-virus program.|`|F9S78wRkaa	Is it keeping the correct time?  If not, you may need a new battery.  Look for the lithium coin cell on the motherboard--it's about the size of a dime--it's usually in a socket and can be replaced with a standard type available at Radio Shack and elsewhere.<br>  <br>  If the time is correct, you need to clear your CMOS settings for the BIOS.   With the power off AND UNPLUGGED(!), open the case.    Near the battery is a three-prong connector with a jumper clip across two pins--move the jumper to the other position--the center pin is common for both positions.  Wait a couple of minutes, then move the jumper clip back to the original position.  Once the CMOS is cleared, you will have to reset the clock, but the "default" settings are usually OK. <br>  <br>  If you can't find the jumper that I describe, remove the battery from its socket overnight (4-6 hours or more) then reinsert it and go on as above.<br>  <br>  ~~ ScienceMikey<br>  My home page: <a href="http://MRudas.2Ya.com" rel="nofollow">http://MRudas.2Ya.com</a><br>  My software blog: <a href="http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com</a><br>  My Protopage links: <a href="http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n" rel="nofollow">http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n</a>

6Djqii7Xaa	The speed a web site can transfer at depends on a lot of things. One of them is how much traffic it is handling. So if a lot of people are using that web site, it is going to slow it down. The speed of the line to the web site and how many others are sharing that line is a factor. The computer and its disk that are used for the server can affect the throughput. Caching and buffering can help speed things up, but that is something they probably have down fairly well if they serve a lot of people. You want max speed? Do your transfer off hours when the network and computers are not busy.<br>  <br>  There can be other factors, but those are the major ones.|`|pVGY9myOaa	It's because either a lot of people are downloading at that moment, or the website had a slow server. 15mbps is also your web provider being optimistic ;) best thing for fast downloads is a torrent.
