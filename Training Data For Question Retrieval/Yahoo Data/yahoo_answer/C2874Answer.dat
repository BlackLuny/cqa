A7VH3iC4aa	Yes you can!  I'm a waitress and I have several friends that are larger and they make good tips (sometimes even better then me, some of the best I know).  It all depends on your personality and how you treat your customer. Plus, if you are quick and can get things done, and have a great attitude, you should have no problem!|`|gaXUIduMaa	Attractive women can get higher tips for being attractive and playing on it.  Other waitresses and waiters can get good to great tips for being friendly and good at their job.  A little hint if your serving me, make sure my order is right and don't let me see the bottom of a coffee cup, tea, soft drink or water glass.|`|zgBelCROaa	That is totally false. I never ever tip on a waiter's looks (unless I'm at Hooters in which case I am expecting big hooters and will not tip flat girls). But as long as the service is good then you get a good tip.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Tips are for good service, not attractiveness. Do a good job, don't piggle off the customer's plate, and you'll do fine.|`|69bp1IMfaa	No|`|VpfSbqhVaa	Personally, I tip a waitress about fifty percent more if I find her sexually attractive. Showing a little cleavage may double the tip, but even big girls get twenty percent of the total.|`|84rmH2Wraa	tipping is "suppose" to be based on service provided. just do your best and if you feel that someone is using the way you look against you, let you manager know. as a former waitress(20years) i can tell you that a LOT of people are really mean. but a lot of them are really nice too. as a manager, i can tell you that as long as you do your job well, you should do pretty good. just don't buy into the "god will provide" routint that so many customers try to sell. you are the one doing the work. you are the one who should get paid.|`|a7AiC90yaa	I tips  base on your service.  not on your looks.|`|IKzLGel6aa	I've been serving on and off for about 5 years.    generally, skinny pretty girls make the best tips, IF they're good at serving, which most of the time they are not. I've worked with lots of ditzes and they suck.    I work with a few larger girls right now and they make BANK. you just gotta make sure you know your menu items, know the bar, and be really enthusiastic and personable. The most effective way to get a great tip off a table is to make them laugh or get them to engage in conversation. good luck =D    EDIT: i forgot to mention that great service is pretty much a given when it comes to earning good tips. the stuff i mentioned is just that little bit extra it takes to make more money.|`|JyEoCBrJaa	No, it is not true only attractive women get tips. Its all about your attitude toward the customer. You can be the prettiest girl and have the nastiest attitude and you want get a dime from a customer. So, its all about how you treat the customer. Yes, there are some places where you get more tips based on your looks but I wouldn't want to work at these places whether I was fat or not. Hope this helps|`|bLX2eXROaa	Yes|`|m936qdlDaa	yea|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	If it's a young guy then it may change on appearance but otherwise it doesn't matter, if you give good service you'll get tips.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If you're a good server, then you will make good tips. I work with a thin, pretty girl who sucks at serving, and let me tell you it reflects in her tips.|`|SuWLf7Uraa	It is definitely not true that only attractive women get tips.  Although, sadly, there may be a type or group of individuals who choose to tip based on looks alone..they are few.    Most people tip based on skill, service, and especially attitude and demeanor.  If you always are pleasant, succinct, know your way around the menu, and especially are very accurate... there should be no reason you couldn't be the best-tipped in the location.|`|O98uPGzEaa	I tip on service, too.  Friendly, smiling, and attentive servers get good tips from me (15-20%).|`|ej8iwJzqaa	yes they sure can !!! dont go fill out an app. at hooters, but as long as you're able to quickly move and deliver good service, meaning get personable w/ paying people,you SHOULD have no problems getting decent, maybe not great tips... reccomend somenthing for them to try, and tell them what to stay away from- make them laugh.. have fun with the experience.. dont think of being chunky as a problem.. take the ball and run with it|`|b88c102c6e163129ac09da634b4d26deaa	If you are nice and efficientt, yes|`|RPY4Hqiaaa	no....u get tipped by me depending on whether or not u were good|`|10KYfxctaa	it depends on where you work    if you work at a family friendly restaurant you will get tipped based on service and not looks
tQsxsuNPaa	Most hotels in Spain, booking a room for two, you'll get two single beds.      It does depend on the hotel and all, but I have never been in any hotel in any country where they gave you two king sized beds!  Nor any hotel where they allowed you to pay for two and sleep four.  They charge you...for a reason.  If you can get away with it, you are stealing.      And they don't put fold out couches into regular doubles either...not in any country that I have rented a hotel room in.  So, unless you want to pay for four, or put two of you on the floor (which, trust me, in you are going to be in trouble.      PS  This has nothing to do with DIning.|`|m936qdlDaa	yea they have two king size beds or they have a pull out couch to sleep on hoped i helped|`|rY7TKWdsaa	Yeah Cause usally they have too king size beds. but mostly they doo. i did that with my grandparents.|`|rnDHbEGoaa	Most likely...They probably have a room with two king size beds if not maybe two of you can sleep on the floor. Ask the hotel if they allow that.|`|vwVXIllqaa	You can rent a hotel for as much people if you want..  Unless there are guidlines to follow..|`|hZyi3lqoaa	depends what hotel some will let some wont i heard there's big beds though.
PDotv2Hsaa	According to the Miele Guide, there are 4 rounds of judging:  1) Restaurants from 16 Asian countries were first shortlisted by top food critics in the region  2) Thousands of 'food lovers' voted for their favourite restaurants  3) A selected jury of 'respected foodies and food and wine professionals' placed their votes  4) The Miele Guides team, joined by contributing editors across Asia, dined anonymously at the top ranked restaurants 'to verify the combined results of Rounds 2 and 3'.    It isn't without controversy. For instance, the Miele Guide is by a Singaporean team and 4 out of the top 20 restaurants are from Singapore. Also, Japan receives the most number of Michelin stars yet only 2 from Japan were named in the top 20.    You can read about the voting process at their website and judge for yourself if the voting process is fair. It seems very non-transparent in the end.  http://mieleguide.com/
