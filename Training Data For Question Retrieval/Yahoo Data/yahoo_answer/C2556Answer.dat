P1Sl55Coaa	I love it when people use "Mythbusters" as a reason for something to be okay to use on an aircraft.  They are not flight test engineers!  They could not possibly test every type of aircraft or cell phone.  I know they cause interference because I've seen it.  I've had people turn on their phones in my CRJ and seen the nav needles jump, as well as a noise in the radios.  IT DOES INTERFERE!  People who say it doesn't just don't know what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  I hope they never allow it either, for the same reasons you quote.  I would love to have a couple of hours without ringing, just like I enjoy having a place where nobody can smoke.<br>  <br>  I hope they never make them legal on aircraft.|`|uFQFRdczaa	The FAA's old answer, that a cellphone could interfere with the plane's electronics and cause a crash, was just simply not plausible.  The Mythbusters even tested it, they found absolutely no interference.  <br>  <br>  In America, we have free speech unless there's a compelling state interest to restrict it.  The interest in keeping planes from crashing would be compelling--but only if there was any reason to believe a cell phone could cause a crash.  <br>  <br>  Also, making a call from the plane can be a major convenience, especially for people who are arranging a ride from the airport.  And businessmen (the majority of flyers, really) need to be available during business hours, they're at work.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	What were they thinking?  Probably that they would lose more business by not allowing cell phones than allowing them.  <br>  <br>  I agree with you by the way.

LPKN4AwGaa	latest news:tata nano went to piligrim places to take blessings<br>  <br>  <br>  Tata Motors has begun gearing up its distribution network, especially in upcountry markets, to aggressively support its future car launches, especially the high-profile Nano, company dealers said. Xenon, a premium lifestyle pick-up vehicle for personal usage, will be launched this month followed by the Rs 1-lakh Nano before the end of the financial year. Tata dealerships have been asked to strengthen manpower, which company officials say would be needed for more efficient customer service. <br>  <br>  “We have been asked to open as many showrooms as possible at the district level as the company has planned a slew of new launches this year,” said a Mumbai-based Tata Motors dealer on conditions of anonymity. However, the company is still hush-hush on exact details of the Nano launch, officials close to the development said. An email query to Tata Motors went unanswered. <br>  <br>  The first lot of Nanos will roll out from Pantnagar (Tata Motors’ manufacturing plant). The company has officially stated that Nano will focus on semi-urban and rural markets. Dealers say bookings will start at the end of this month and deliveries will begin by March 2009. The company’s current dealer network for passenger cars will also be tapped for distributing Nano. <br>  <br>  Xenon was launched in Thailand last year and currently retails in South-East Asian markets and Europe. It will be positioned in the premium lifestyle segment in India. Xenon retails for $17,000 to $19,500 in Thailand. The only model that comes close to this vehicle in India is Scorpio Getaway. <br>  <br>  The initial bookings for Nano are being done to gauge the demand for the vehicle. The base version will be without an AC. Company Officials indicate that Tata Motors may be able to stand by its promise of launching Nano at Rs 1 lakh. Officials close to the project said there may not be too many takers for the base version of Nano and most consumers may opt for the AC version, which would retail at around Rs 1.4 lakh. It is learnt that Tata Motors Finance is considering various financing packages through SBI and HDFC to offer competitive interest rates.|`|TuGkVqwraa	May be this December.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	TATA's ultra modern new plant was canceled by a group of India farmers who thought the land should be used differently.

gwj1a9jPaa	The only criteria to use when choosing a driving instructor is how good they are - their gender makes not one bean of difference.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think you are paranoid - your instructor has to look at you whilst you are driving to make sure you are doing the right things at the right time.<br>  <br>  Of course, you are not helped by the contributor above who is stoking your paranoia by suggesting instructors hitting on pupils is a regular occurrence - it's no more likely than in any other job. That contributor suggested also that they have lots of questions about this on his/her website - well, I've checked the website, not only is it packed with extremely poor and inaccurate advise, I can't find a single question about instructors hitting on pupils. This is a classic example of why the 'web' can be a poor place to seek advice - the so called 'experts' often aren't experts at all.<br>  <br>  I suggest you stop worrying and just concentrate on your driving.|`|xYHyTJY9aa	You know what, regardless of whether you feel she is hitting on you or not, if you are not comfortable with her as a driving instructor, find a new one.   You don't need to tell her why or the new one, but if you feel unforcomfortable you will not be listening and therefore learning.|`|TC9Z548Maa	your right this is a pathetic question.

You must have confidence in each others ability.  Unfortunately driving alone with a person can develop the wrong messages.  If you are happy with her tuition keep a watching brief to see if you are correct and if soleave.  However I could be tat YOU are giving out the wrong signals to her.<br>  On the second question, you should not have to go back to 'square one' if you change instructors but he/she will need a lesson or so just to see what stage you are at.|`|qDQ5uLrSaa	Hi, There are good and bad instructors both male and female.<br>  <br>  Some pupils get on better with instructors of one sex or another.<br>  <br>  All Driving Instructors in the UK are CRB vetted (the same check used for people working with children and vunerable adults), and the DSA take any accusations of inappropriate conduct very seriously.<br>  <br>  To become a driving instructor takes a lot of time, money, and dedication.<br>  It is quite unlikely that someone would become an instructor so they could pick up girls.<br>  <br>  If you do feel uncomfortable with a certain instructor, tell the driving school or change driving schools. people do get signals mixed up occasionally.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your learning.<br>  <br>  Danny|`|j2lgLG27aa	I often get emails from visitors of my site about this - what should i do if the driving instructor is flirting with me. My answer - report them.<br>  <br>  However in your case, you might have developed a paranoia that male instructors will hit on you and chose a female one instead. However the paranoia could have progressed even further hence you noticing these signals with your current instructor.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, nothing has been tried on you yet, so you could be 50% right and 50% wrong. My advice is simple - if you don't feel comfortable with your current instructor, then change her. You need your full concentration when driving and obviously yours is somewhere else.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Spend more time concentrating on driving and less time worrying about the instructor.........the only thing that is going to happen is that you wont learn how to drive correctly.......|`|kJ4g1vujaa	You have to be comfortable with your instructor otherwise its a waste of money.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Yeah, you might think you're irresistable but others won't.<br>  <br>  Any driving instructor who is professional will NOT hit on you.<br>  <br>  I bet you're not really all that anyway.|`|1yGDFTieaa	When I was learning to drive I didn't even notice the driving instructor was there - I was too busy concentrating on the road & my driving, perhaps you should do the same!|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	your paranoid<|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	omg im sure she doesnt fancy you. how self centered lol <br>  driving instructors have to be watching you at all times and will often stare at you so that they can make sure your paying attention to the road and using mirrors correctly. jeez! <br>  <br>  i started off with a male instructor and had my first 13 lessons with him. he was an idiot though so i changed instructors, i went with a woman instructor who was much better and after 10 lessons with her i passed first time! if your not happy with your instructor then change them. i just think if your changing your instructor because you think they fancy you then thats just sad, they have a job to do at the end of the day.

VyxvT0fuaa	I have had some experience with these atrend boxes, for what they are they are not bad, the sub specs you linked to state that the optimal sealed enclosure would be .5 cubic feet and the atrend box you linked to  is .7 cubic feet not a huge difference, if you get it I would go to wal mart or a hobby store and pick up a bag of poly-fil pillow stuffing and split it, half on each side( or less it should not be packed in there super tight) , this will trick the sub into performing more like it is in it's optimal sized box by slowing down air movement inside the box. the only problem you might run into with this box is the subwoofers actually hitting the carpet if you are running them hard, a common problem with boxes made to go under the back seat of pick ups, you can get around this by using some wood covered in cheap carpet to shim the box up a little bit to get more clearance. If you need even more clearance you can unbolt the seats and use some good washers between the seat frame and the holes in the floor, usually good for up to a half inch give or take.|`|oGqMC4Eyaa	If you look at the instruction manual that came with your subs it will tell you the dimentions you need for a sealed or a ported box.  Since the box you want is sealed the volume will be less than for a ported a box.  Since they are tens by the looks of the box it looks big enough but double check.  Just for guidlines for my Alpine 12 R's for a sealed box I require 0.8 cu ft per sub and ported which is what I have 1.3 cu ft.  I hope i helped answer your question.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|Om7OdUvKaa	depends on what kind of frequencies you loking for, if you looking for very low bass than this box is perfect cause it isnt ported, it doesnt have a hole for air to move in and out. But if you looking to hear the strings of a bass guitar than you would want to get a ported box. Also the box is 1.4 cubic feet, and for it not being ported its gona give you some nice deep bass. So it is a good box for something like the beat of a hip hop song, not so much for the guitars strings. But you can put high pass on you amplifier to you get a more even bass frequencies. hope it helps

There is a special law in this town that all cars must be registered with the town and a manual is issued to the drive whent his happens.  They call it the pace manual.   There are important historical stories in the book as well as  the history of the Taco Bell corporation, including the famous story of April 1, 1998 when they ran a full page add offering to buy the Liberty Bell and were planning on naming it the Taco Bell. This is a true story. honest.   so anyway, The pace manual is to be kept on the passenger seat and no one is allow to move it.  Once a month, a new update of page sixteen is handed out by the official Pace Manual Guardian, who is appointed by the Mayor.  This special page has a guide to all the restaurants, ice places and pretzel emporiums in a 65 mile readius.

Most of what I've seen however in the south comes out of Mexico (First number of vin being a 3 refering to Mexico)<br>  <br>  |`|1APGuDk6aa	They're right, but the Mercury Cougar, which was a Contour underneath, was actually made in Michigan (Flat Rock, to be exact). So the Contour's platform was used in a Michigan plant, but the Contour wasn't actually made in Michigan.|`|k6u1Kka0aa	Not made in Michigan, made in Missouri.

It is located under the hood directly below your distributor. It takes a grease gun that you can get at Autozone for $12.95.|`|ucYbUqTQaa	Does the car require Power steering fluid? If so, that may be the reason as to why your steering is stiff.|`|8QMvsIfKaa	It might help to get a turkey baster from the dollar store and suck out the old power steering fluid and replace it. Some people think it's ok to use trans fluid when in fact a few times I've had people with a power steering leak and all it needed was the fluid sucked out and new power steering fluid put in and the leak stopped or slowed down. I don't have an answer for it, it just works sometimes. You could check and see that it's full too, it sounds like maybe you're getting an air bubble every once in a while in a line or something.|`|dgDW0Pt5aa	Has it been wrecked?

Which brand is best? If you listen to their adds, all of them are best, but I seriously doubt that any of them are increasing their cost of production by adding anything that would truly differentiate one brand from another in overall performance.|`|AA10686863	NONE!  It'd be stupid to add vitamins and minerals on gasoline.  On the gasoline can be added octanes or other additives.|`|3a54cf17051a047dcddaa46497cca406aa	Deisel...    It'll put hair on your chest.

AA10265913	They are both equal in all reality.  Its more of a preference for people.  With that being said.  Dodge is my preference.|`|HUluAQM3aa	On a scale of 1 to 10?

Read almost any car magazine or site. Chrysler is one of the worst car companies in existence. They make junk cars,have junk customer service.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Its a preference thing.|`|DwMU437uaa	I'd say that chavy is way better because the parts are built better and the engines dont fail as easily.  but if he think dodge is better let him think it i mean we all think what our family has been driving is better than what our friends parents drive.  i say that cgevy is better because i have a 1995 chevy camaro  wit over 160 k on it and it still runs a great as it did when i got it.  i also have a chevy suburban that has 350 v8 in it and damn that thing beats my camaro off the line.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	That depends on how you define "better"?|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Is cancer  better than a tumor?|`|ihdopjXuaa	Hell yeahhhhhh! I still like dodge better than ford though!|`|gGE5TrFyaa	hells yea. chevy's rule the car world!!!!|`|R4r8Q8BUaa	WELL NO SHIIIITTT CHEVYS BETTER!!!!!!!|`|QnCmowfmaa	Chevy has and will always be better than Dodge.|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	Here's an example for you.  I've got a 4.3L 5 speed Silverado with about 70,000 miles.  It's not anywhere close to stock, but everything is external and all bolt on parts.  It gets 26 miles a gallon when I drive verry conservatively, I can drive around in 5th gear overdrive while the tach is spinning at 800rpms at 35mph, that's using less gas while driving than at idle.  It usually gets around 16-18 mpg because I have a lead foot and a manual - go figure.  It runs low to mid 15's in the quarter (for a v6 full size truck that's really good.)  And will beat any stock ford or diesel anything.  Against chevy's sometimes I win and sometimes loose.  I will say one thing even though I hate em Dodge has some fast trucks.  'Hemi' trucks are severely overrated, but it's those friggin single cabs with the regular engines (modified) that get me every time.    Any other full size truck with a v6 - ANY one, is a pile of dog **** at 70,000 miles.  They can't get gas mileage worth anything, they can't pull jack, and they're slower than dirt.  That should cover the trucks and I feel the same way about chevy v8 trucks.    The cars - any decent Dodge car with real horsepower is most likely around 4000 pounds.  Everybody knocks old cars for being boats, but the modern Dodge 'muscle' is what's really overweight.  You have to take off a few hundred pounds on those cars or bolt on 50 hp just to be able to keep up with a performance chevy of the same caliber.  Ever since Dodge stopped making the SRT-4 their small car choices are just dumb.      Most Dodge cylinder heads are made in China, and if you get lucky 50% of the parts could be American made.  Hell, it's not even an American company anymore - DaimlerChrysler. Conclusion, chevy is better than dodge.|`|2bqmotqlaa	CHEVY ALL DAY                                                                      vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                                           vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                                                                vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                            vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...                                                                                           vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...                                                                                           vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...                                                                                          vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...                                 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                                                          vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                                                       vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv                                                      vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Chevy has better mileage and towes better, We have a race car and a very large trailer. We have tried each of the 3 domestic trucks and had the best luck with Ford believe it or not. But the Chevy did a really nice job to. Dodge didn't have as much pull, didn't handel as well and sucked up more gas. People can like what they want, but all things equal, they are my last choice. Judged strictly on real world performance.|`|2d3ab98f216743c75f2f200fa734cb7caa	if you are talking pick-ups then I vote Chevy -- because the repair bills are less and the parts are cheaper thru the auto supply stores. I have had GMC's in my business for 20+ years and have good service from those trucks..........|`|Ak35Y562aa	This question is stupid.    Its like saying which brand of OIL is better.  Or what brand of WATER is better!      But from my experiences.....    Ford is HIGHLY underrated.  Ive owned many Fords, NEVER had problems, they are tough as hell.  Ive been off-roading with mustangs, f-150's, SUV's, NEVER had problems after high-revving, throwing them thru ditches, sand and water.      DODGE - my brother owned a dodge dakota 3.9l magnum, that was the TOUGHEST little truck ever....we INTENTIONALLY tried to destroy the truck and COULDNT do it! We ripped the exhaust off, dumped the clutch in 4x4 at 60mph, caused the tires to lock and smoke,LOL.  We threw the truck threw massive ditches and drove it off giant hills.  We had the cabin FILLED with mud, there was literally water and mud 3 inches high in the floors, seats were SOAKED, there was mud on the CEILING, lol.........the truck DEFINATELY got stuck at that point, but it KEPT running.  We even drove it thru a river and got water sucked into the ENGINE!  The truck stalled out, but fire right back up and drove out.  The truck studdered and kicked for 2 days after that, but the water worked its way out and was FINE after that.      CHEVY - Im not a chevy fan.........however, i have to say, i owned a 97 S-10 ZR2 SS, 4x4 obviously.......and that was one BADASS little pickup! I drove that sucker threw 3 foot rivers, took it threw nice sized mud pits with LARGER trucks, yet never had problems.  I nose-dived the truck off a mud hill so hard, my entire licenseplate+bracket just broke clean off into the mud. Didnt even notice till the next day that my entire licenseplate and bracket were missing,lol.  Then got it stuck off a hill one time, had my brother pull me out with a Tractor,lol, he yanked the **** out of that truck, and yet the back bumper never came off or bent! And he was pulling me UP a very steep mud/grass hill.  I drove threw a road that had 3 feet of seawater mixed with freshwater.  I drove over half a dozen trees and even dragged one under my truck half the way there!  GREAT little truck, but a PAIN to work on!      FORD - Great....pulled an f-150 off a frozen lake with my mustang one time,lol, hooked up a chain to the frame, DIDNT even feel the truck behind me.....just incase your going to argue that it was stupid. Well I STILL have the car 6 years later, NEVER any problems.  I have a Mountaineer now, BFG M/T's, AWD, V8, Ive pulled out a commercial work van from a sandpit, the van was loaded to the roof with tools, and he was pulling 2 jetskiis.....I just hit the gas and Gripped INSTANTLY.  Ive been off-roading in the SAME mud holes as a v8 silverado 4x4, and HE had more trouble than me getting out! I almost had to pull him out.  (he had crappy tires, I had Mud Terrains.......goes to show what difference tires make!)        OVERALL.....id have to say, IT DOESNT MATTER what you drive.....as long as your driving!  ALL manufacturers have problems and flukes.  Just because you have a good or bad experience DOESNT mean THAT manufacturer is the best or worst! That is just a stupid ignorant way of thinking......plus it's 50% driver too.....remember that.|`|uUVdCKV6aa	chevrolet lasts longer for sure! my 1993 chevy 1500 pickup has 310,000 miles on it and runs as strong as ever.|`|8Be0iMN5aa	A car is a car besides ford that something else.|`|YhS192Qvaa	IMO Chevy is 2 times more better then any Dodge.
328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	People, people.... STOP GIVING THE KID BAD ADVICE!!!!!!!!    There's no such thing as "30 day refund policy" or "72 hour cooling off period" when purchasing cars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    All cars, used or new, are YOURS once you sign the dotted line!!!!!! No refunds, no exchanges, no nothing!!!!!    Some dealers do give you 3 days or even 30 days to exchange (Saturn does this for new cars) or refund but that's their choice, not because the law made them do it. No such law exists!!!!!!!!!!|`|8GDBr2U9aa	No. A 7 year old car would be sold "as is" with no warranty. Car sales are final. The time to take the car to the mechanic would have been BEFORE buying it. It's too late now.    Once again...there's no 3 day/72 hour/10 day/30 day or even 30 minute period in which a car can be returned after the purchase. I wish people would stop spreading this crap. Car sales are final!|`|hiTuNQU3aa	only if the dealership offers that.  carmax does.  otherwise your screwed next take it to the mechanic FIRST.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Depends on state and local laws. Contact your DMV for the answer.|`|y9YcWzVsaa	you can if you there was a warranty on it, if it was an AS IS sale then no you cant get anything back...talk to the dealer where you trade it in and see if he can fix the problems on the car|`|wKXUfedMaa	your in a jam my friend. next time don't buy a used audi or have it thoroughly checked before buying.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	next time take a mechanic to check the car first.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Chances are no. Read through your sales contract and if there is mention of a 30 day return policy or exchange then you are in the clear. But if it states "sold as is, where is" in any type of wording you are screwed. Always be sure to read the fine print when buying a vehicle.|`|pUYfE1Zraa	i think there is some kinda law were you have like 72 hours. so atleast try and bring it back, that way if you go to judge judy. you'll win.|`|AA10346371	Most used cars are sold "As is - No Warranty".  Once you sign the sales contract it is yours.  You accepted and signed the sales contract you accepted this car "As Is"  What part of "As Is" don't you understand?    You should have brought it to a mechanic BEFORE you bought it.
AA11721907	Most like you have bad rings or bad valve guides also if your PCV Valve (Positive Crankcase Ventilation valve) is plugged it will cause the crankcase to build up to much pressure and will force the oil passed the rings and it will burn it in the combustion chamber. try the PCV valve frist! (White smoke is burning antifreeze, Gray/blue smoke is oil, black is unburnt fuel). You can try a additive like Stop Smoke or Engine Restore some time they work.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that sounds like bad rings and valve guides. pull the plugs out and see if there,s oil on them. there is something you could try. i think auto zone sells it. you can get ( no smoke or smoke b gone) it might help you out for awhile.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	My car smokes from the tail pipe all the time. Whatever problem you have, it seems all cars have it. I think it's called combustion.|`|2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	If you are loosing coolant then yes possible slight head gasket leak, if no coolant loss then is most likely worn engine parts, like valve guide(s) or maybe even rings but the slight oil loss is not much concern.|`|H8sqQxBbaa	It depends on what color the smoke is.     If it is gray, then that is a normal color.    White usually means that you have a cracked head.  The water mixes in which causes the white smoke.  The smoke will be almost a pure white.    If it is black then the you have a chipped/cracked piston.    If either of the latter two is the case then put some oil treatment (to stop the smoke) in your oil, drive down to the local dealership, and trade the POS in for another car.
TdrgZwnoaa	"ELVIS" is an Erickson Air Crane modified into a water bomber with the addition of a special module. Erickson bought the basic design from Sikorsky. The reason they don't build more is the expense of construction and the maintenance costs.

Check http://www.swapalease.com to see what others are paying.|`|EDOI3Wnzaa	Why would anyone lease a car in this market.  Lease rates are high and you have to bring a lot of money to the table. Money you will never get back becuase the bank owns the residual. Have you noticed how most if not all banks have pulled out of leasing cars. Its a bad deal. New car rates are around 5%, if you have good credit.  You can put the same amount down as the lease ask yo to do and you own it in the end. Your payments may be higher but the Toyota will be an asset if you pay it off in 3 to 4 years.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Ask the same question to all the Toyota dealerships in your area, and lease one from the lowest priced one.|`|jOwOeWkqaa	If you are looking for car lease deals. you can look into the AutoPromoCenter.com. I think it post car lease deals from different dealerships and you can compare between them. good luck with your car shopping :)
AA10346371	There is a lot more than you think to installing a different size engine than what was originally installed from the factory.    At one time you could easily do this swap.  But this was before vehicle emissions standards, electronic fuel injection, and computer controlled engines.    You would need to find a similar year V8 Mustang donor car with a decent engine, transmission, cooling system, and rear end.  The entire V8 drive train should be installed because the 6 cylinder parts are not designed to handle the V8 horse power.  Also, the 6 cylinder cooling system is not large enough to cool a V8 so you would have overheating problems if you don't change this also.    From this donor car you would need to swap the engine, transmission, rear end, cooling system, engine management computer, front suspension, and under hood wiring harness.  You would also need to install a new exhaust system.    Seeing you had to ask this question in the first place, I doubt you have the mechanical skills or the shop equipment to make this swap yourself.  You will need to pay someone else to do this for you.  The going rate is about $100 per hour.  I would expect a skilled mechanic to make this swap in about 40 hours.    So you want to buy a V8 Mustang donor car with a decent drive train which will cost you about $4000 and pay someone to about $4000 to swap the drive train from the donor car into your car.    It would be cheaper to just buy a V8 Mustang.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI   going to a V8 from a V6  Most likely you well need to replace the radiator to a bigger one, transmission as well. and depending on how big of a V8 you may need to change out the front springs to some from a V8 Mustang.

Somehow, after "I slung a rod threw my engine," I suspect you'll need these beefier parts.|`|7bf29965ca07a3a325e65f762653f5b0aa	it will probably be cheaper to swap in the same v6. Clean up the car sell it, then buy a v8. Although alot of people do v8 swaps. At the end of the day, if you are asking how much it will cost, that is a very good indicator to me it will be easier and better for you in all aspects, to swap v6, fix v6, sell v6 , buy v8.    I did the whole upgrade swap thing, and ever since I will never do it again on my main vehicle....only a secodary vehicle with plenty of free time not my everyday duty ride.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	there,s more to it then just that. in the first place if you put a v8 in it then you will have to change the transmission. your better off to just put another v6 back in it.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Used engines range in price from $2.50 to $6.00 a cubic inch.

zlPAVkUBaa	Large aircraft use Aluminum. They are integrated into the design of the wing if they only have wing tanks. As said, bladders are also used for extra fuel carrying capacity. For an example, this is out of the C17 manual...<br>  <br>  "3-376. The fuel system has four integral wing fuel tanks.<br>  The tanks are vented and inerted. The four tanks are formed<br>  by the internal wing structures. The outboard tanks, 1 and 4,<br>  have a capacity of 36,445 pounds. The inboard tanks, 2 and<br>  3, have a capacity of 51,655 pounds. The total capacity is<br>  176,200 pounds. The inboard tanks have an aft and forward<br>  compartment. The compartments of these tanks are interconnected<br>  by flapper check valves. They allow fuel to flow<br>  between the compartments."|`|ykyr1Ywkaa	The wings are the fuel tank.They're made of aluminum.Some carry bladders in the tank to prevent leaks.Others have the tank completely sealed w/ a special type of sealant that is fuel proof,when properly applied between frames,spars and in fastner holes the wing will not leak.It withstands pressure changes,temp. changes,the wing itself flexing in flight,many physical forces work on the wing,but the tanks do not leak.|`|kEjxtQNDaa	this depends on the aircraft  most commercial aircraft have an aluminum fuel cell with a rubber bladder inside for leak stoppage. Home built aircraft can have the same of a fiberglass  fuel cell  depending on the Model and what the plans call for

c48nm70gaa	You bet they are! Consult your service manual for the recommended items to be looked after @40,000 miles. Tell you what, as soon as my wife gets home from work I'll read over the manual in her glove compartment for exactly what Toyota recommends - not some creep dealer trying to mile the crap out of a customer.    I do know this for sure. At 30,000 miles Toyota recommends draining and flushing the antifreeze. Other than cabin and engine air filters there's really not much else to do except regular 5,000 mile oil and filter changes. I had to ask repeatedly when the transmission fluid should be changed as it's not in the book either.

213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	Well what's done is done. Looking forward, as long as you have a simple interest loan, you can either refinance at a lower rate , or you can pay off the car early. If you make additional payments each month, you will decrease the amount of interest you pay on the loan, which reduces that $26,126.

5fb953f56c0d23c9218db55110b835c8aa	you should be able to tow that boat, do not tow in overdrive|`|d9ECb7N8aa	Yes, with the rebuilt trans, you should be able to drive the Jeep as if it were new.     With towing, you may want to invest in a transmission cooler to help keep the trans cool while towing your boat. Also use lower gears (lock out of overdrive when applicable). Heat is the  1 killer of auto trannies.|`|AA10503489	There's no reason why you can't tow with it after a transmission rebuild. In fact, tell the transmission shop that you will be towing with this vehicle and they may be able to strengthen it more for towing. It may cost a little more, but it will be worth it.    I have a '96 Chevy truck, and the trans was rebuilt 30k miles ago. About 3 times a year, I tow my race car to the track about 50 miles away. The car and trailer weigh about 4500 lbs together, and the truck does fine with the rebuilt transmission. I have added an auxillary transmission fluid cooler in front of the radiator, and this really helps extend the transmission's life span.    You will be fine just towing a small boat, but I would install the fluid cooler anyway. They are no more than $40, and installation shouldn't be too much extra.

24kFbAdsaa	Registering your car under your dad's name to get cheaper insurance could lead to denied coverage for an accident.

If the squeal is only when you are applying the brakes, by all means get brakes.  The longer you go without fixing them, the more damage is done to the rotors and the more it will cost you to repair.
nAzbLdBCaa	Only a few states regulate yacht brokers.  And those that do are more like car salesmen.  Ask a dealer near you and I'm sure they can steer you in the right direction.    There's no formal training like a realtor's license. If your thinking of starting your own, online business however, that's a lot different.

mR5ZtjqWaa	MD sent some people over because they didn't believe it. Israelis offered pics and flight data recordings.<br>  MD didn't come back shouting Bullsh!T! so I guess it is true although they did doubt it was just a taxi accident but that was disproved entirely.<br>  <br>  It's very possible with the F-15 to fly and be controllable with only one wing. It has high thrust to weight ratio, high wing area, wide body, and lift producing fuselage which kept it in the air plus double vertical rudders& stabilizers and aileron+horizontal stabilator roll control which kept it in control. <br>  <br>  It would be a crash if it never flew again but it did:<br>  "After two months the same F-15 got a new wing and returned to action.<br>  McDonnel Douglas attributes the saving of this aircraft to the amount of<br>  lift generated by the engine intake/body and "A Hell of a good Pilot"."|`|TdrgZwnoaa	It is true and the plane was repaired and returned to service after about 3 months worth of rebuilding.. The aircraft manufacturer did not believe it either and demanded that the Israelis turn over all flight data from the aircraft to prove their claim. All information was confirmed from the flight data. <br>   The reason the aircraft was able to survive was the fact that it has a partial lifting body construction and and an extremely powerful engine. The fact that the elevators can operate independently was also a contributing factor.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Yes. It happened. I know someone who was an engineer for them that examined the aircraft after that event.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The story is true, but all of the YouTube video is bogus, except for the still photos and the pilot interview.  Doctored video and (very corny) simulation were used to create the moving visuals.<br>  <br>  The aircraft continued to fly because it has a very wide body, and if the speed of the aircraft is high enough, the lifting effect from the body and one wing can be sufficient to keep it aloft. McDonnell-Douglas had not tested this scenario, but after the accident it analyzed it and discovered that flight with one wing was just possible, if you had enough speed. There was also a stub of a wing left.  Look at the aircraft from below, and you can see how it just might fly even with most of one wing gone.<br>  <br>  The aircraft landed at very high speed.  Had it tried to go slower, it would have been uncontrollable.<br>  <br>  Supposedly there's at least one other similar incident with the F-15, in Japan, but I don't have details.  And a handful of other aircraft have survived with severe wing damage or damage to other lifting surfaces, for similar reasons.<br>  <br>  The pilot didn't eject because he didn't know the wing was missing.  There would be no reason not to eject had he known, since "saving" a plane without a wing serves no purpose—the airframe is going to be written off, anyway.<br>  <br>  The pilot was skilled but not a miracle-worker or a genius.  As others have pointed out, if you have enough horsepower, you can make a brick fly.|`|uFQFRdczaa	If an F-15 had a wing come off, I'm sure it ended up on the ground.  You could call that a landing.  If this happened, you can really only call it a landing in the sense of "any landing you can walk away from is a good landing."<br>  <br>  If the altitude and airspeed were low enough when the wing came off, it's even plausible that the plane stopped upright and the pilot walked away.  But that plane is never taking off again.  I'd call it a crash.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	Not just the IAF either.  About 20 years ago, a USAF F-15 had a wing blown off by lightning.  All the way up to the fuselage.  By quickly reconfiguring the controls, the pilot brought it in to a landing.  We had pics of that bird in our maintenance office.<br>  <br>  I was in the USAF at the time.|`|wgQ8snGiaa	Yes it's true. I know it seems impossible to some, but it is possible. The F-15 has a large wing surface area, this allowed it to continue flight even with part of it's surface area gone. Another thing to note is that the F-15 has two engines, when one wing was gone, the engine on that side was on full throttle while the other engine was on minimal throttle, this helped to stabilise the whole aircraft. Furthermore, with the help of electronic fly-by-wire, it further helped to stabilise the aircraft. Of course with skill of the professional Israeli pilots, the aircraft managed to land safely.|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	I never found the confirmation that you are seeking, but the incident is true and aerodynamically possible.

l7fyLFFtaa	Ok, this happened to me a few years back. Yes, you now have a warrant out for your arrest. When you go to the court house to arrange another date they will have you go in front of a judge. The judge will have you put in custody and taken to the holding cells at the court house. You will then be processed and will probably go to minimum security jail. You'll get the orange jumpsuit and everything. Basically they will hold you until your next court appearance which will be the next day or two. <br>  <br>  In order for this not to happen make sure that you have someone that can post bail for you. Figure $500-$1000. You may even want to see a bail bondsman before you go to the courthouse. Then when you are taken into custody and processed the person you have post bail will get you out of there before you go to "jail".<br>  <br>  Word of advice, do not go ona Friday. Because the courts are not open on weekends they will keep you over the weekend until Monday when you can go to court again. You do not want to have to spend all weekend in jail - even a minimum security facility.<br>  <br>  It's good that you asked about this. I wish I would have known before hand what was going to happen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,|`|m81dfyOYaa	The judge probably issued a warrant.

t2rUhyANaa	Your information is wrong.<br>  <br>  ZENNS are sold in both BC and Québec. It's all down to provincial regulations. A ZENN has no hope in hell of passing any car safety tests, so it cannot be sold as a car in most provinces. Québec and BC have created a special category for low speed vehicles (aka Neighbourhood Electric Vehicles) that are not required to be proven safe....<br>  <br>  BTW, the ZENN is hardly "built right here". It is actually a French-made Microcar MC-2, only the electric powertrain is installed in St-Jér?me.

Although, you do have to disconnect it.  Follow the positive battery cable to the starter, remove all wires from the starter (you might want to label them, to remember where they go), remove the two starter bolts and pull it out (don't loose the shims if there are any).  Reverse your steps to install.  Good Luck!

There is a thing called a trans break which will have your car break at a particular RPM and release the break at the set RPM.

lHLDvVALaa	Paint thinner is a mix of mostly straight-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. While they are about the same weight and would burn about the same as gasoline, paint thinner would make a horrible fuel. <br>  <br>  The reason for this is that straight-chain carbons have a really, really low octane rating. In fact, n-hexane, which one would find in paint thinner, by definition, has an octane rating of 0. <br>  <br>  Offhand, I'd guess you'd probably looking at an octane rating of 20-30, which is way too low to reasonably run any engine made today. Try run an engine on an octane rating this low, and you'll probably destroy it. <br>  <br>  Putting all that aside, though, I just checked and the price on paint thinner, locally, is around $18 a gallon. I paid $2.15 a gallon for premium gas yesterday. Even if the energy content of paint thinner were higher(which it probably is), it wouldn't be a significant enough difference to pay 5 times as much.|`|uFQFRdczaa	I've heard of people running some acetone (a paint thinner) in a gas engine, they claim it improves fuel economy.  Acetone is one of the main ingredients in carb/fuel injector cleaner, this would explain why some people claim a 5% increase in economy while others say it makes no difference.  If you have a dirty carb or injectors, cleaning them can make a noticeable improvement in fuel economy.  If they're not dirty, no difference. I would not add more than a liter to a tank full.<br>  <br>  Be careful adding anything but pure petrol, some chemicals (notably alcohol) are not compatible with the plastics and rubber in some fuel intake systems.  A tank full of cheaper fuel will not save you much if you have to replace your fuel pump.<br>  <br>  Chip oil will not run in a petrol engine, but if filtered and pre-heated runs fine in a diesel.|`|d89qNyb6aa	No I don't think so but a friend of mine had hers converted so it was able to run on chip fat.Now it's been done,she goes to her local take aways and they pay her to take the used oil away.She then puts it in her van and runs it that way.I don't know how much she paid to have the engine converted.|`|PmaB839Naa	Don't even try it.

IOWKDSj4aa	the first thing to do is to check the dome light on the car to see if it is still ON when you are trying to lock the doors to arm the security system.  almost every time I hear this concern the problem is with the switch on the door that is short circuited causing the dome light to stay on.  The way the secutity system "knows" that someone has broken into the car is by monitoring the operation of the dome light that comes on when the door is opened.  if the light comes on when the system is armed then the alarm goes off.  conversely, if the dome light is on when you try to arm the system then the alarm won't set.  so check the dome light; if it is staying on then one of the door switches is bad.<br>  <br>  if not the dome light, check the trunk light<br>  <br>  there is a switch on the key cylinder inside the door that arms the system when the key is used.  if that is bad the system won't arm with the key, but it will usually still arm with the remote.  i wouldn't rule out that possibility but it is a long shot<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|03fiqGJwaa	that is so wrong i can't even type anymore
yrx6GxDcaa	bigdaddy  i would check the fuel filter first least expensive thing. you need to determine when it will not start check the fire at the plug like i told you before if it is not firing it is going to be an ignition problem. If it is firing but will not start it is fuel we need to determine this. This has to be done when it will not start. Then we can go from there. When it is running does it run smooth and good.

Most places that change oil use the cheapest bulk oil available to make more money. What I suspect has happened is that the oil that was used in your engine was so low quality (like QS oil) that sludge has formed and baked into your piston rings, valve lifters, and valve seals. The cure is to have the engine completely motor flushed with butyl cellosolve, which dissolves all these unwanted deposits, and returns the engine to good working order. Then, install Mobil One. Have this changed after 3 months, and then wait a year to change it again. You can test the engine for presence of sludge by removing your oil filler cap and flipping it over. If it is coated with a dark waxy or black flaky deposit that you can scrape with your fingernail, the whole inside of your engine will look EXACTLY like this. Imagine this junk living on your piston rings and inside your lifters!!! A good engine flush should dispose of these deposits. E-mail me back for the best procedure! Good Luck! P.S. Lifters make noise because they are full of blockage, not because they have worn out!!!|`|s8cZsSX0aa	lol lol lol Your getting scammed. no such thing as a loose lifter.

With the kind of money you would spend you could by a nice Camaro or Mustang and not need a procharger.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	You could, but it would have to be a custom job, there arn't any kits for it. You'll need someone to make you an intake for it, and you'll have to get a custome mounting bracket and pully setup.<br>  <br>  not to mention your going to need to get a new cam and ECU to handel the boost and make use of it. You'll also probably want to get new internals so that you don't blow your engine up. The extra stress of boost on an engine is extreamly hard on it and your reliability and overall lifespan of the engine will decrease drastically.|`|3cFKfFifaa	If you want to supercharge your Grand Am, the only kit currently sold is made by RSM. It is a poor quality kit (bad bearings), has limitations, and the "tune" you get with it is useless.

I am sure you will get advice to remove a door lock and take it to the locksmith, but this would be a waste of time...the door doesn't have all the tumblers that the ignition does (door 8, ignition 10), and the ignition requires a key for removal.  Plus, a chip key was an option that year, requiring a programmer if so equipped.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Try googling it!|`|yVWKiTwTaa	on most vehicles theyre are tons of codes in the trunk on a sticker usually posted underneath side of what hides your spare tire. however you kind of have to know what you are looking for because it wont say what code is what. all your codes are under theyre paint code, lock code, etc etc. maybe also check the sticker inside the drivers side door.|`|6Iz2KXHAaa	The keycode is usually written in the manual.

You can sand it and treat it, but you will have a matter of weeks, maybe months before it shows again|`|ytgjFFq6aa	sand it with 180 grit sand paper, tape off areas that you dont not want painted, get a can of sandable etching  primer and spray those areas. if you can get a chip of your paint, you can take it to an automotive paint supply store and they can match it right up. just remember to prime over the spots you sanded, because its going to take it to the metal if you remove all of the rust. the etching primer acts as a sealer. Block sand the primer with 320 grit sandpaper and you can get a sanding block from any parts store. once you block sand and see no dark spots which means its smooth cause if it has any low spots they will stay untouched by the sandpaper. once you have done these steps its ready for paint.|`|22ee87c4e7e3af321345eba90245a377aa	Sand it.

AA10851094	When you have your oil changed have the shop check your oil pressure with a mechanical gage. This involves removing the oil sending unit and installing a gage and then running the engine to verify it has acceptable oil pressure.

That light is triggered due to low oil pressure.<br>  <br>  You either have a bad oil pressure sensor (best case scenario), or if the sensor is OK you might have clogged oil passages and/or a failing oil pump preventing oil from circulating around the engine properly.  Poor oil flow in an engine usually means a dead engine shortly thereafter, so get it fixed ASAP if you're looking to keep the car running much longer.|`|ytgjFFq6aa	i had this same problem, usually when you have a leak it will make your oil pressure drop when idling, my leak was around the oil sending unit, i replaced it, stopped the leak and it had contant oil pressure after that, im not saying its your oil sending unit at all, but do check for leaks all around the motor|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Could be anything from the press. relief valve in ur pump to bad bearings--get an oil pressure test.|`|iByp9i2Naa	Add blinker fluid.|`|e0TNrx76aa	replace the oil pressure switch. i have see many of these cuse this condition. as long as the oil level is in the " safe' range on the oil dipstick.

However, if it is outside your house you have no control over it and BT should pay. I would challenge them on this.|`|mKVFIklaaa	The line is on your property, you are liable to pay. It's that simple.

HFrsH9MRaa	First, power wash your entire engine bay at a do-it-yourself car wash. Remove and clean your battery cables at BOTH ends. Many times, problems like this are caused by corrosion on the negative battery cable grounding point. Keeping your engine clean always improves driveability. Salt from the road usually lands on the grounding point and causes corrosion or loss of total contact. This will overwork your battery and charging system. Locate and clean with Gum-out spray, throttle body, idle air control valve, and PCV valve. Good Luck!!!|`|N7LlOAcOaa	ITS A FORD WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?!?!?! you bought a cheap car and you get what you pay for. Ford quality is the worst out of all the american companies.

f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	If she will not admit liability then each of you will be determined to be 50% at fault. Therefore 50% of you damages will be paid by the other person's liability coverage, the other 50% of your damages will be covered by your Collision coverage and it subject to your full deductible (if you do not have Collision coverage then only half of your damages will be paid).

AA11823124	Honda's are famous for the seals leaking at the bottom of the valve cover and letting oil run into the plug well.<br>  Were the plugs fouled with burned ashy oil, or was it wet drippy oil. If the latter, just replace the valve cover and seals and be on your way.<br>  If you are burning the oil (ashy deposit) then plan for a rebuild or replacement engine. Honda engines are very easy to rebuild, and long blocks are reasonable in price. Just check with your local parts source.|`|GeOMJN4Daa	If your spark plugs are through the valve cover (in little holes on top of the motor) then the oil might be coming from a bad valve cover gasket.

Replace the gasket and you should solve the problem. I see this all the time. 15YR Mechanic|`|HfPT0nSsaa	It is probably just letting oil through the valves or piston rings.

Sometimes you can just tighten the valve cover bolts and that might help. They tend to come loose sometimes. That or you can replace the O-ring. It's no big deal. I highly doubt you will need to put a new engine in it. An engine for a 1990 is cheap if you're buying a 1990 engine that hasn't been rebuilt or anything. A new engine fore a 1990 is still a new engine so you're looking at a pretty big chunk of change. I googled it and saw one for $550 and that wasn't rebuilt just out of the same car with 180K miles.|`|2ekmwNm6aa	If the car is running great, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that you need a new engine. While it is usually caused by worn piston rings or cylinder walls, it could just be a bad PVC valve. This causes excessive pressure that pulls excessive oil into the combustion chamber.  Oil could be leaking from your valve cover gaskets down onto the plugs and working it's way inside but if they are good and tight, this probably isn't happening. I don't know if I would spend the money on a new engine if it is running good. They are probably as much as you paid for the car. Good luck!|`|oiW7wZkuaa	Kilometers or miles, you've got a worn out motor. Your choices are not great. *If* you can find a salvage yard that has a Honda that old or even has the engine ...consider yourself lucky. If you pay to have it swapped you'll be paying someone to swap out your high mileage, worn out motor for another high mileage worn out motor ....do the math and figure the logic.<br>  <br>  Your current motor might be repairable depending on where the oil is getting in. If the piston rings and cylinders are worn, you're toast; that will require an engine rebuild to repair. If the oil is coming from worn valve guides then the cylinder head can be rebuilt and that is do-able and not too expensive if you really want to keep the car.<br>  <br>  A rebuilt motor will be the most expensive (regardless of the fact your car is almost 20 year old ...you've got to pay for someones labor) but will truly give your car a new lease on life and will probably be the most expeditious. There is, however, a great deal of quality difference with rebuilt motors ...how well a rebuilt engine holds up depends greatly on the care with which it was rebuilt. Use an engine from a highly reputable re-builder with a solid warranty .....which of course translates into more moolah ....you get what you pay for.
kWWhFQdbaa	Don't bother paying them, they will get the message and forget about you.  I had car insurance for my own car and when I scrapped it, I cancelled all direct debits.

It could be that that the sim is trying to use RAM that is already allocated for these programs.<br>  I would also check your RAM capacity:  less than 2G for a real-time rendered sim is going to cause you issues.<br>  If you didn't have Direct X9, your program would go out and download it for you.  If you aren't even getting to the "you need Direct X9 or later" screen -it's definitely not that.

Other things, the fairing savers or sliders, they are cheap and save alot of thing, exhaust--D&D i've found to be second loudest behind the muzzy, headlights-you can get the diamond ones that change color depending on the angle you look at them from and of course neons.  These are just a few areas to start in, and once you've been riding for a while there are other cool things, best one I saw was a "wheelie light" where an extra fog light/headlight was mounted in the body under the driver, so when the driver did a wheelie at night, he could still see where he was going.  Just ask away and the answers are out there<br>  <br>  The newest and coolest paints that I've found is where thye can put a chrome coat on the body and then chrome color over it, so a chrome bike with a black chrome striping on it or something is always unique.  headlight covers help, custom stickering for now, until your comforatable riding, then you can actually have things painted on.

EmgiGg17aa	If it doesn't start after spraying  in starting fluid into the air intake then it is an electrical problem.  You got no spark at the spark plugs.   Could be anything from bad spark plugs to a wire grounding out that goes to the ignition coil from the ignition switch. <br>    Do not get in the habit of using that starter spray.  That is like using a sledge hammer on top of the pistons.   It is really hard on the engine.  If it won't start with gasoline it is an electrical problem 99% of the time.   Find somebody with car electrical experience or get a repair manual from the public library and do it one step at a time.

Yes your fuel filter may be plugged as it was sucking the last of the gas out of your tank, and anything else that was in there, or your fuel pump may be fried because of this, but chances are that the engine is no longer primed.  Once you've put gas back in the tank, there is going to be air in the lines, so your going to have to do one of two things:<br>  if its a fuel injected motor (basically newer than a 87/88) you can turn the key off and on a few times, this will make the fuel pump push fuel into the engine.  After a few times, you should have no problem, it should have pushed the air out of the tank.  You may want to step on the gas a few times.<br>  <br>  If its a carb. motor, you will want to again, prime it by pushign on the gas pedal a few times before you start it and may want to put a little fuel in the carb.  there will be two or four barrels (or butterfly on top or two)  one set should be slightly opened and thats where you'll want to pour a little bit of the fuel.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it, and hope its not a pump/filter that needs to be replaced|`|ytgjFFq6aa	turn your key to the on position and let your fuel pump fill your gas lines back up, then try to crank, if this does not work, locate your fuel filter which is running from the tank to the engine along your fuel lines, check it and replace if need be.|`|yhctmGJzaa	what kind of make and model is the car it could be many things wrong

Try it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reverse parking, or parallel parking is one of the big set piece manoeuvres that you could be asked to perform in the driving test, but its one of those important skills that once you know how to do it, it all makes perfect sense.<br>  <br>  It's important to practise on a quiet road, especially at first, as lots of other traffic can prove off-putting.<br>  <br>  Cars parked in parallel are parallel to the curb, in one line, with the front bumper of each facing the back bumper of the adjacent one. <br>  <br>  On your test, the examiner will ask you to reverse into a space of about two car lengths, park as close as you can to the kerb safely, smoothly and under control. The examiner will want to see that you take good all round observation, do not get too close to the parked car, do not mount the kerb, and stop reasonably close to the kerb.<br>  <br>  Remember - given time and practise you will be able to reverse into a space one and a half times the length of your car. As an initial step, you need to make your intentions clear. Slow down well before the parking space, and signal into the space. Get into reverse gear as quickly as possible, and the combination of reverse and brake lights will signal your intentions to drivers behind.<br>  <br>  Then line up your car parallel with the vehicle in front of the parking space, making sure you are not too close to it. Next, turn the wheel one turn to the left. Look all around to see that it is safe to proceed, as good observation is essential. <br>  <br>  Continually look over your left and right shoulder, using clutch control where necessary, to ensure there are no hazards such as pedestrians crossing.<br>  <br>  Back up your vehicle so that the rear bumper enters the parking space first. When your car is at 45 degrees to the parking place, slow down, and start turning the steering wheel back to the right.<br>  <br>  Continue reversing until the rear of your vehicle is about 2 feet from the kerb. Gradually turn the wheel towards the kerb to bring your vehicle in a straight line with the side of the road. Brake once your car occupies the middle of a parking space. <br>  <br>  It is quite acceptable to move forward a small amount to complete the manoeuvre safely and ensure you are occupying the middle of the parking space. <br>  <br>  Keep practising this skill until it becomes second nature.<br>  <br>  Good luck, sure you will do fine.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Put the car in reverse gear and back up.

If the stain under the car is brown/black it's oil, if it's red it's ATF.  <br>  <br>  Could be just a loose oil filter or a bad PCV valve, could be a main oil seal or any number of gaskets.  For the amount of oil you describe, the first place I'd look is the rear main seal, which can be replaced for a few hundred dollars.  You'll have to find where the oil is coming from to know how much it will cost to fix.  If you keep driving with a leak you'll cause soil and water pollution, if the engine runs out of oil you'll damage the engine beyond repair.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	add oil then drive to a shop so they can look at it and tel you what is wrong with it and how much its going to cost to fix it

mR5ZtjqWaa	its a question of preference. <br>  Both manufacturers use  the same technologies, same concepts, same manufacturing processes, same safety features etc.<br>  <br>  The big difference is the fly by wire system and it's limitations.<br>  <br>  Most Boeing planes still use a mechanical system, such as cable&pulley to allow the pilots to move the control surfaces. <br>  Nearly all airbus planes use fly by wire, which involves pilot control inputs turned into electronic signals that go though a computer (3 at least) and the computer computes how much to move the control surfaces and sends these signals by wires to the control actuators. <br>  <br>  The airbus FBW computer system does not allow the pilot to put the aircraft into dangerous attitudes and will limit the amount of bank, pitch etc that the pilot can put the aircraft into.<br>  <br>  Newer (relatively) boeing aircraft like the 777 are also FBW, but the FBW is limitless. The computers will not limit what the pilot can do.<br>  Some pilots prefer to have this amount control instead of having a (dumb) computer limiting them. <br>  <br>  Other than the FBW, everything else is the same. Even safety records are similar although, I think Airbus has almost the same number of accidents as Boeing, but Boeing has a lot more planes than Airbus. Quite a few of Airbus accidents were linked/caused/affected by the FBW computer system.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	You know what? I don't understand at all either. In fact, I'm prepared to bet that I understand even less than you do. Hard to believe? Maybe, but listen to the rest of my answer first. I have to confess that when you said "Airbus" I started thinking about a magical yellow school bus that has retractable wings and is capable of Concorde-like luxury air travel. Now what do you think? Exactly.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The difference is that a Boeing aircraft does what the pilot tells it to do, whereas an Airbus does what an engineer at a desk in France allows it to do.

AA10297143	First, you should never let a car completely run out of gas.  Once they do, you sometimes have to pour a tad bit of gas into the carburetor to get it primed.  Sounds like you need to run a computer diagnostic on it to see what may have happened due to the running out of gas episode.  It shouldn't cost too awful much, but be careful where you take it as not all mechanics are honest, sad to say.  Hopefully the problem is isolated to just having some sludge or dirt from the tank sucked into the lines, but as two others have alluded to, you may have cooked the fuel pump.|`|AA12261615	you could have burnt the fuel pump out, when the run dry like that they wont last to long, dry pumping one is bad for it,either that or you picked up all the debris on the bottom of the tank and its trying to clog the filter up on it,when i ran mine dry i had to replace the pump on it, it got the pump on it in a few seconds,it doesn't take much now days to ruin a good pump on one of those,one thing you can do is run a pressure test on the fuel system before you pull the tank and replace the pump,good luck.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	The fuel pump relies on fuel for cooling and lubrication.  By running the tank dry, you may have cooked the fuel pump at the same time.  Another possibility is that the years of particles and sediment that had settled at the bottom of the tank was picked up with the last remaining fuel in the tank and is now clogging the pump and filter ( filter is part of the fuel pressure regulator on all but '95 and very early '96 Neon models.  Don't confuse the fuel accumulator that is just ahead of the right rear wheel well as the fuel filter...it looks a lot like a filter but it is not ).<br>  <br>  To confirm that it is a fuel problem, check the pressure up at the fuel rail.  It should be 49 psi.  Below that and it's likely the pump and/or a clogged fuel system.<br>  You can try to replace the fuel filter/pressure regulator separately but if it was my car, I'd just replace the entire fuel pump the first time.|`|mqMdbAyQaa	Fuel pump has burnt out. Depending on where it is located will determine how much it will cost to fix, you should find out where on the car it is, and then see if you can fix it yourself. Thats my advice, I had a fuel pump go out on a truck once, and it cost 750 bucks to fix it, luckily it was under warranty, and I only had to pay a fifty dollar deductable.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|s8cZsSX0aa	First thing I would do Is try to bleed the air out of the system. On the Injector rail there is a valve, that looks like a tire valve stem. Get a friend to help. Turn the ignition to the on position but dont crank the engine over. Keep in on position for about 10 seconds then turn it off, Take a phillips screwdriver and depress the valve on the injector rail. (be careful as gas will come out of this hole.) When you press this down you should get a nice full stream of gasoline that rises about 20 inches.and then fades off.  If you get air or not a steady stream of fuel repeat this several times. When you get a good solid stream try starting it.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	most likey trash and most likey wil have to have a shop flush the fuel system to get it right again and really your better off buying fuel when you reach 1/4 tank and not driving it til the light come on|`|iz9hzHN7aa	When the tank runs low or out of gas, it is likely that you will pull the "junk" (rust and dirt) from the bottom of the tank into the fuel system. I would start with replacing the fuel filter, at worse you will need to drop the gas tank, and replace the fuel pump. both are relativity cheap.

Easiest way is wait till its dark out side, open the hood and start the car. Look around the plugwires with a flashlight to see where they are.

If you see any arcing then grab some new plugs and wires.|`|YM8GapVNaa	i agree with the motor mount issue. pop the hood and have some body start the car and gradually accelerate. if you see the engine trying to raise up out of the car you have a mount issue.|`|ktMefP0oaa	I don't agree with the others, I believe what you have s a transmission or engine mount issue, the fact it is not misfiring, but viberates when you accellerate but stops when you let off is classic mount issues.|`|AA11904226	Get your wheels balanced in your local garage

Did I mention the issue they have with blowing head gaskets? Yep, it has been an issue since 1996 on the grand am. There has been a huge issue with the wheel speed sensors on the car. Causing the abs light to stay on. The list goes on and on and on and ON. This is one of the reason's that GM has decided to get rid of the Pontiac line of cars. The issues on most pontiac are the same. They have used the same parts, over and over. Never re-engineering them from the original design flaws. So to answer your question. They are very good cars, for the mechanic you hire. You will give them lots of work to keep your car running. I have been doing warranty work for the Pontiac line for about 6 years. It is good for us, but NOT the consumer.  They sure have been keeping me busy. Good luck and I hope this helps.

KyaAdqUpaa	If your wife took the loan out on the truck then the title would be in her name with the bank listed as the leinholder.

XLXncQu9aa	You would likely have a heavy fine.  Fines usually stem anywhere between $50 - $500, but if you were going 10 above then the fine wouldn't be too high.  As for the cracked windshield it depends on if the officer notices it or not.  If they do, then you will be cited for that as well because it is illegal to drive around with a cracked windshield especially if it is an obstruction to one's view.  As far as traffic school, you won't necessarily be required to attend again.  If it was your first offense then chances are you will just be fined.  However multiple offense warrant either points on your license or possible suspension and you may have to attend traffic school again.|`|wpgRMjgraa	A lot if the judge will not allow you to go to traffic school.<br>  <br>  1.

Also, you should check on the laws concerning cracked windshields in your area.  Where I live, a cracked windshield has to actually inhibit your ability to see the road, otherwise it isnt an actual violation.  Lots of cops pull you over when you have a cracked windshield simply because they can tell most people that it is illegal, and they wont know the difference.  10 miles over might be a hefty ticket, but the passenger shouldnt matter if you have a regular license.... and the windshield might have been an excuse to pull you...|`|4rmvGTNBaa	Your deffiantly looking at 3 points.if they have given you a ticket The cracked wind shield is dodgy as it depends alot on if the crack is in the field of vision.

AA10297143	Three ways, and I am not trying to be facetious.  FIrst, go to the Amtrak website and check there.  Secondly, most rail is still for cargo, so check with this link for more information:  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=railroad%20map%20in%20USA">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=railroa...</a> and of course the third one is where you might think less of me, but check with "terrorists", as I am sure they have all of the infrastructure in the USA "mapped" out and ready for their diabolical use.|`|AA10164889	Try the Texas Railroad Commission web site.  They have a map viewer that seems to do the trick.  You can also see rail lines on Google Maps.<br>  <br>  Most states have a state railroad commission or a railroad department under the Department of Transportation that should have a map for that state.|`|Y5pgqBcAaa	Try the yellow pages online.Then click on aerial maps.If you have a rail line that runs close to your home.You can follow the tracks where ever they go.
AA10164889	This law dates back to the 1920s, when fewer railroad crossings had flashers and gates.  The driver has to open the door to allow any passengers who prefer to do so to get out and cross the tracks on foot.  Then the driver had to wait on the other side for the passengers to get back on board.<br>  <br>  Goofy, I agree, but that is what was considered safe in those days.<br>  <br>  About that time and before, there was a law in New York State that all motor vehicles had to have a man on horseback going in front of them waving a red flag.  So there are lots of goofy laws.  It's just the way things are.|`|WsKUEgQraa	It's just for safety.Any vehicle carrying hazardous materials is also required by law to stop before going over a crossing.Lights and gates can't always be counted on to work.It's man made and they can and do fail.I have seen it happen more than once.Stop look and listen are words to live by.|`|3GHXk05saa	They stop to check for the train.

Any vehicle transporting passengers for hire must stop no closer than 15 feet, nor further that 50 feet from the nearest rail. The driver  must look in both directions, and open the door to allow them an unobstructed view and to allow them to listen for an approaching train.  <br>  <br>  Similar laws also apply to trucks that are transporting hazardous materials, except they don't have to open their door.
DydFQ0fcaa	I recommend a set of Dunlop Grandtrek AT20 tires (factory size: 265/70).  Compared to the Continental's, they have identical performance, comfort and durability (tread life) ratings and you'll save between $50 - $80 on a set of 4.

It's not hard but it is time consuming. Follow the manual. If it's a vvc engine DO NOT disturb the vvc mechs, just remove the head complete.  The head doesn't necessarily need a skim and you should avoid it if at all possible. Head bolts can be reused if within tolerance (9 times out of ten they are) which is a relief as it can cost ￡60 for a new set. At the very least get the uprated MG gasket or if you want to go the whole hog you can fit the multi layered steel Land rover gasket with the modified main bearing ladder. More work but allegedly provides more evenly spread clamp forces to prevent further failure. But even this is not 100% fail proof.<br>  <br>  Imo the uprated MG gasket and meticulous attention to cleanliness and detail is usually enough.|`|d7oxOMT6aa	What Spannermonkey said^^^<br>  <br>  I'd go for the multilayer payen "land rover" gasket, but not bother with the uprated oil rail, as that's only needed to cope with the beaming loads placed on the block by the four wheel drive transmission on the freelander. it's not needed on two wheel drive cars.<br>  <br>  Check the liner heights are at least 3thou above the block face, and even. if they are less than that, use the older rover elastomeric bead gasket.<br>  <br>  when I do MGF gaskets, I usually drop the whole engine and rear subframe out of the car, this make working on the engine easy, but is probably not a good idea unless you have a 4 poster lift to hand!<br>  <br>  visit  <a href="http://forums.mg-rover.org/" rel="nofollow">http://forums.mg-rover.org/</a>  for more advice.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	A common problem with the MGF but if you have no experience in doing one then I wouldn't attempt to tackle it yourself. I'm sure if you shop around you will find a garage willing to do it at a more reasonable price. There are so many factors and costs in replacing a head gasket. Your cylinder-head once removed will need to be skimmed by a professional as it will probably be warped due to over-heating and the water-pump may also need replaced at the same time.|`|AA11988604	Its a complicated job, but there is plenty of info out there on how to do it.  Be sure to have the head milled flat again, as failing to do that will just cause the new gasket to blow again

TdrgZwnoaa	The shoulder makes an excellent emergency avoidance lane and a Police Officer may direct you up the shoulder of a roadway. Other than that, the shoulder is considered off limits unless your vehicle is disabled.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well there is a circumstance when you can pass using the shoulder lane.  For example, if there is an emergency then yes you can use the shoulder lane to pass.  Think about this, if there is a broken down car in front of you that is holding up traffic then you must pass on the shoulder to continue.  Usually passing on the shoulder is only done in an emergency situation like I have explained.  However if you are just being impatient and you use the shoulder to pass traffic when there is no traffic emergency then it becomes an illegal maneuver.  So the case of an emergency is the best scenario that you can pass using the shoulder.  But if you do make sure it is clear to do so and take your time.|`|FIG58FVpaa	Technically the shoulder of the road is anything to the right of the white line on the right side of the road.<br>  <br>  It is NEVER okay to pass on the shoulder of the road. <br>  <br>  The only situation I could see where you would need to is to avoid rear ending someone who stopped suddenly in front of you...|`|GNmzjDHHaa	The shoulder is for emergency only.

Once you get on the shoulder to pass someone, you're increasing your speed.  The shoulder is used for breakdowns and often has bits and pieces of blown tires and glass.  If you hit any of these at high speed you may blow a tire and lose control of your vehicle.  The shoulder is an emergency breakdown lane.  Although some places permit it, I advise against passing on it.|`|sVuBJjrJaa	Shoulders are safety spaces for an emergency, when you pass on your right the blind spot for the driver in front of you is bigger than the one on the left, so he or she cannot be aware the you are passing , then move (he/she) to the right, and a bad accident may to happen.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	You are not supposed to pass on the right of a vehicle.

5JI64hBnaa	First of all I am a BIG fan of Bazooka tubes and I have used countless subwoofers. But I use bazooka for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1. I have a wrangler that gets rained in occasionally and the bazooka tube is very water resistant. They are also easily removed and light weight if you need the space to haul something.<br>  <br>  2. Bazooka tubes are CRAZY efficient. At the same time, they have limited output, especially the 6s and 8s. <br>  <br>  3. I REALLY like the sound quality. It is a tight, fast sound. Many people prefer the deeper rumble of larger subs.<br>  <br>  As the other fellow kind of said, they need to be pointed into a corner of your trunk or whatever for the best sound. Weird but true.<br>  <br>  I used to use a 6" tube (BT6014) that set right in front of my driver's seat in my Eclipse and it really made the bass sound so much better because it was coming from up front. With a black leather interior, it was barely visible and it surprisingly didn't interfere with pedal operation or entry/exit. I am skinny though.<br>  <br>  Bazookas get a bad rap. But they are a good product and way better than the models from a decade ago. They handle more power now and look better. I crank mine pretty hard because it's only a 6 and that cone moves like crazy, but it has yet to blow in 3 years. <br>  <br>  Also a great product for boating, but that's for another discussion.<br>  <br>  Check ebay if you do decide to get one.|`|g5g1yD1daa	BAZOOKA TUBES FOR THE BASS|`|PIuEcCRPaa	Bazooka Tubes are crap, the only place for one is maybe a home surround sound. the bass sucks, sound quality is horrible and they just look stupid. go with a sub box! even if its just a single 10" it will sound sooooooo much better!|`|JqUGmk3Paa	Tubes are good if you want an easy setup and moderate bass... You wont get the "thud" like some 12s or 15s are going to get you, but they kick, are completely self-contained, and are extremely simple to install.  Boxes are must stronger, considering the actual size of the speakers and the surface contact with your trunk.. Think of the size of the bottom of the box compared to the tube.  Bazooka tubes need to be bolted to the car to work well, also.  Boxes are a better way to go if you know someone who can hook you up... They are much, much stonger.

GeOMJN4Daa	I see what you are talking about with the parts stores. Your EGR valve is only available at the dealer.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	First, locate and clean your throttle body and idle air control valve. You usually do NOT have to replace the EGR valve, just clean the carbon out of it. An improper fuel/air mixture will CAUSE the EGR valve to load up. Keeping the IAC and throttle valve clean will improve the fuel mixture. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can clean the EGR valve by spraying Gum-out directly into the intake manifold with the engine running at normal temperature. If not, clean the valve out manually. Good Luck!!!

If you do mostly city driving, it might be time for new pads.  Take it in for a diagnosis, as ignoring a brake pad issue will score the rotors and cost you a lot more than new pads.    Is the car still under warranty?  Even though pads are a wear item and not covered, they will probably diagnose for you for free.|`|dsODBNXFaa	Well, if by rubbing you mean grinding, then the wear indicator on your brake pads for your disc brakes is grinding against the rotor.  This is an indication you need to get some new brake pads soon and have them put on.
Jm0KGlIsaa	tire mounting is tire mounting.  as others have mentioned, a new valve should be installed, and the tires/wheels balanced.  there's no way to screw that up unless the balancing machine is not calibrated properly or the technician gives up.  the balancing machine locates the place where a weight should be added.  the technician finds the correct weight and hammers it or sticks it (depending on the type of wheel) on the wheel where the machine tells him or her to do so.  this process is repeated until the screen on the machine reads 0.0.  <br>  <br>  the biggest problem that arises...and it is quite common...is when the technician uses an impact wrench (air gun) to torque (tighten) the lugnuts on the wheels.  They are supposed to use a colored torque stick on the impact wrench (to limit the torque and to evenly apply torque to all the lugnuts) or use an impact wrench with a torque stick and then finish the job manually with a torque wrench.  <br>  <br>  the consequence of not using a torque wrench (or a torque stick on an impact wrench) is a vibrating steering wheel (esp when braking) and eventual damage of the brake pads and rotors.  this is because the pads are not being evenly applied to the rotors.  another consequence is that it will be very difficult or impossible to remove a wheel manually on the street (if you get a flat tire) because the technician overtightened the lugnut because he or she didn't use a colored torque stick.  So make sure you ask them to toque the lugnuts by hand with a torque wrench.  some of the shops say they use a torque stick only, and not use a torque wrench...this should be fine.  the reason many technicians don't use a torque stick (and a torque wrench) is to save time...they're either uninformed about the consequences or don't care.|`|FIG58FVpaa	The major things that can go wrong are damaging the wheel and/or tire while mounting or dismounting tires or balancing them incorrectly.<br>  <br>  I've never had tires done at Walmart. I buy tires online and have them mounted at a reputable dedicated tire shop.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	If you have expensive after market alloy wheels, I wouldn't take them anywhere but a tire outlet that sells fancy wheels. If you have the stock steel wheels, Walmart or any repair facility with a tire mounting and a balancing machine is fine.|`|AA11988604	it's not rocket science.  have it done there if its the cheapest place, then take the car for a test drive.  if you feel any wobble in the steering wheel, take it right back and have them check the balance.<br>  <br>  always have your valve stems replaced and the tires spin balanced when you get new tires.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	If you have alluminium wheels or special wheels take it to a tire shop--they have the proper procedures to do it without bending the wheel, which is very easy to do--other wise they can do it|`|shKc7lZcaa	We have had trailer tires mounted at Wal-Mart before and we have never had any problems.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|YNoNwijoaa	wallmart all the way brother!!!!<br>  thanks lee
2S2Wfiykaa	1700.52 miles....|`|AA10297143	The link assumes a beginning point in Reno and an ending point in Iowa City, but comes up with a basic route of 1697.59 miles and can be driven legally in 23 hours 58 minutes.  Of course, you can likely make better driving time then that, especially if you have a driving partner.
U9iTDxspaa	Ok to be frank, I am a all day every day manual car driver. <br>  <br>  PRO'S: <br>  1. There easy to drive<br>  <br>  CON'S:<br>  1. They don't get as good gas mileage<br>  2. They tend to have more problems<br>  3. They cost a lot more to fix<br>  4. If your transmission goes, there's just about no fixing it, you will need a new one, where in a manual you just need to switch out a gear plate.<br>  5. Normally an automatic car cost more off the market.<br>  6. If your a fast driver you need to be more care full, its easy to mess up the transmission.<br>  <br>  I can't think of any more off the top of my head but your best bet is to stick with manual cars untill you make a lot of cash. <br>  <br>  Sorry, i hope this helped.|`|7265d27fc13e89f482c384391b4a5007aa	with a manual car you typically get better gas mileage. You also save on brakes if you downshift. Manual typically costs less, but clutch problems can be expensive. Automatic cars are easier to drive|`|Gn99Fcy0aa	PROS: In short -- you will find it is much easier to accomplish simple tasks like dialing a phone, changing the radio station or even drinking a cup of coffee  You free up one hand.  At those extra long traffic lights, your left leg won't get tired holding down the clutch and on snow and ice -- with modern vehicles, the traction control on an automatic seems to be a bit better than with manual transmissions.<br>  <br>  CONS: You cannot push start a vehicle with an A/T.  Extra consideration needs to be taken when towing an automatic. Putting the car in neutral will not suffice as you can burn up an A/T because the engine needs to be running on many makes and models for the tranny fluid to get pumped though the tranny.  Lastly, you have to maintain A/T transmission fluid as you would your motor fluids|`|kUWeVCoTaa	Automatics are a lot easier to drive because you dont have a clutch but with a maual you choose how much revolutions the drivshaft makes before you change gear also you get better economy with a maual<br>  <br>  hope u find this useful :)|`|xhS2Q0Mwaa	i would say an automatic is way easy to drive manual will be better on gas if you drive them right it really depends on what you prefer
