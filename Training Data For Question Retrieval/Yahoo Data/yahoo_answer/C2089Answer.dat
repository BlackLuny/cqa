AA11997985	Photoshop is not a free product - it is a commercial product for sale.  Picnik or Lunapic are great all round web based and FREE editing tools. Adobe, makers of the expensive Photoshop, now has a free website version in Photoshop Express.  If you need/want more features downloading GIMP is a great options.  Still free, but you have to download the software. There are also free tools to add text blurbs, to make collages, to put your photo into other images. There are a number of tools that allow you to put the image of a face into other photos for some fun creations.

Why would you allow that person to be abusive to others even while distancing yourself from that person? Don't you hate it when people take all their frustration out on you and don't even address the question you're asking? I've pretty bad experiences where I have definately had to do both without regret.|`|0s09peMQaa	If you replace block with 'flame' it makes sense. But no, not really. I find blocking is a tool that helps avoid reporting.|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	no ..some may..i block but have not reported for hundreds of years..so to speak  and that was porn that i reported...|`|2sMgFQ3oaa	All i can say is people on Y!

spFmMOL2aa	no that's point gaming, so i report them, but they stay anyway.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No, since it is a violation of the guidelines to solicit and the q will be deleted any way I rather not waste my time.  Also if the question was a subject matter I could give a knowledgeable answer I would have already done so without someone begging.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No. That is not allowed on this site.

7u77AiBjaa	People continually have problems using their Yahoo! 360 picture in Yahoo! Answers. Usually, it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the image to show up. The last delay took about two weeks for many people. Another delay has started - which you are experiencing - only a few days after images began re-appearing. <br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your correct 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.

Staff members are aware of these issues and should be working on a fix.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try uploading the image once more, ensuring the image size and format are correct.

I followed one those ads just to see what would happen, and I could not find a phone number, or even an email by which I could contact the product suppliers. I think it is bogus.  I also think that it could be method of observing Yahoo users.  For example, I needed to get some reading glasses. In the days leading up to their arrival I discussed it with members of my household. The night before they arrived, I said to my housemate in a loud voice, " I can't wait for those glasses to get here!" I logged into my Yahoo email account, and lo and behold, it's the "hag" and she has a pair of glasses blinking on and off!! This was the only time this ever happened.

You can also have your avatar picture, but you can only have one yahoo!avatar picture.<br>  <br>  If you want don't have a yahoo!avatar go onto yahoo!avatar and sign in your email account. You'll start out from scratch and then find more things to add to it. You can change your face,hair,clothes(pants shirts etc.), accessories, and background. You can also add little items in the background, but they won't be seen unless you want a full body picture. If you want a close up picture click on the button that shows a little face and arms. Then click the bar on the bottom and drag it to the end. Now you should have the perfect close up.<br>  <br>  Once your done with your yahoo!avatar or picture go to the link I have put. Check the box with the picture you want.<br>  <br>  If you already have a yahoo!avatar or picture do what I just said.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!
1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	Actually there isn't a way to view the questions that have the most stars on Yahoo! Answers. However, if you are talking about questions with the most stars EVER, you can view the list of the questions having the most answers ever, they are also questions with the most stars but are arranged according to the number of answers they got. To view this list, go to the Yahoo! Answers home page, click the big tab "Discover" at the top right of the page, then click the blue link "No. of Answers" under the Discover tab. This should take you to this page ? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_ylt=AjNpJnZdTuji4FKlGo6_YWpJxQt.;_ylv=3?link=over&sid=0&more=1&s=-answer_count">http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/index;_ylt=...</a><br>  <br>  To view SOME of currently OPEN questions that have relatively large number of stars, go to the Yahoo! Answers home page, scroll down a little, do you see the bold "Answer Questions" just under your network  Q&A?

lXE75yQjaa	Yahoo is dyin a slow and painful death. Half the time when I try to leave comments for others, I get cockblocked.|`|7u77AiBjaa	Yahoo has not provided technical support for Yahoo! 360 since October 2007. You can post feedback to their 360 Team/Product blog at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> . The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. Although, don't expect a personal response. <br>  <br>  Many people have asked questions about this issue (particularly during the last few weeks). This feature is frequently glitchy (going missing, sharp reductions in numbers, resetting to zero, and etc.), thus it's notoriously unreliable. There really is nothing that you can do about it and Yahoo will not help you personally. This could be a temporary (most likely) or permanent problem. You can't reset or modify the feature yourself beyond setting permissions. I did check and I have the same problem as you do.<br>  <br>  You can try refreshing your "Home" or "My Page". You can try clearing your browser's cache and cookies. I doubt either will work to help this problem though. It would have to be "miraculously" re-started by Yahoo, which again, is not guaranteed to happen.|`|5eSSAT69aa	mine doesn't either. Oh well. Yahoo 360 is cumming to an end.|`|FZ9d3xWhaa	You just want to think it is not working.<br>  It really is.

zDQIPFH2aa	This happens because the page where you see the zero answers is a snapshoot from YA servers around the world and is several minutes old.  In the meantime, thousands of people are reviewing posts and many are answering the same time you are.  There may be fifty people that are about to submit their answer before you even start.  If you want to prevent some of this, when you get to a question, always hit the refresh button of your browser, before you try to answer.|`|BM3dDb88aa	It's just because they have a ton of people answering it. It is really annoying.

Click on "more actions"----then "check all" and then "delete".<br>  You can switch back to Classic mail afterward.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, with Classic, it's page by page. <br>  BUT----you can speed it up by changing the "messages per page" to 200 instead of 25. That makes it 8 times faster, with 200 at a time. <br>  <br>  Mail page>>options (top right)>>scroll to and click on "general preferences". Now, go down to *Folders/Search Results* and change the number in the box----then click a blank space (outside the box), to set the number, (so it won't roll to a different number), while you scroll to the bottom of the page to click "save". Then you can "check all----delete" 200 at a time.
uhZ38xYkaa	Well it is good and bad.<br>  <br>  Good because it gives you a sense of pride knowing you are good in a category, also notifying others that this person knows what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  Bad because some people are jealous like trolls and try to report you and stuff, so you have to hide your Q&A's which can sometimes get annoying.<br>  <br>  Became Top Contributor- 2-9-09|`|ncCWnApDaa	Well people haven't exactly been stopping me on the streets asking for my autograph because I'm a TC, but seriously the badge isn't a big deal, all it proves is you answered a lot in a category or 2 or 3, despite yahoo claiming it proves you to be a knowledgeable member, there are point gamers, trolls and spammers who have attained the badge, which should prove that quality answers do not determine a TC badge, is I've said a few times now yes you do need a few BA's, but even BA's don't prove it was a good quality answer, there are tons of bad and plainly false answers given BA, I honestly think the site would be better of without them, since they reward quantity answers over quality.

So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your correct 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> .

It's a REALLY tough business - many very good actors never get a job. I know plenty of them.<br>  <br>  POSITIVE:<br>  Find friends in the business.  REALLY  in the business.  Hone your craft.  Join Summer-stock theater.  Take ANY job you can find in the business.    If an agent sees you  working and improving,  and taking on heavier and heavier roles they're going to notice you and promote you.  The trick is to find a reputable agent - there are thousands of scam artists there, too.<br>  <br>  Everyone I know with their SAG cards say it's the absolute best job in the world - acting.<br>  <br>  Me?

zDQIPFH2aa	Take a simple question. What is your favorite color? (note this question is a violation, but for illustrative purposes here). If you answer pink and someone answers blue, instead of other people answering blue or pink, they just TU/TD the answers. If they don't like your pink and are neutral on blue, they may TD you and do nothing for the other answer. It is nothing personal, it is just away of agreeing or not.<br>  <br>  However, thumbs down can be gotten for many reasons, only one of which is the correct usage. Some of the ways:<br>  <br>  1. the answer is incorrect or you disagree with an opinion (the only real reasons)<br>  2. you sound over 18 (believe it or not)<br>  3. you support the rules on YA<br>  4. you understand the rules of YA<br>  5. you take the site seriously<br>  6. you answered the question (some answerers will TD all other answers)<br>  7. it was fun (random playing)<br>  8. you are in the military, a policeman, or some authority figure<br>  9. etc - <br>  <br>  very few TDs are legit so don't sweat it unless you get one say on a science or math question, then review your answer for a mistake|`|pQaOcS6faa	they're just having a bad week, if it continues, go ask em' what there problem is.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Hmmm, me too, I Just figure I pissed off someone with no real life when I told them the truth to their more than likely idiotic question.<br>  I'm sure you've seen the trolling questions, I figure peeps like that are bored and vindictive.

However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.<br>    <br>    * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.<br>  <br>    * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.<br>  <br>    * Close any links to your 360, and email.<br>  <br>    * Delete your open questions and answers.<br>  <br>    * Set your Network and Q&A to private.<br>  <br>    * Delete your contacts and fans. To delete fans block then unblock.<br>  <br>  Then just leave it.

Make sure you have a title too XD. <br>  You can also draw some pictures to make everything a little easier to learn and pretty to look at. <br>  If it's math and dance, then make sure you have all areas of math in it. Not just angles, leaps, turns and balance. Like...mirror reversals, patterns, numeration, and measurement.<br>  Hope I made sense.

7u77AiBjaa	People continually have problems using their Yahoo! 360 picture in Yahoo! Answers. Usually, it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the image to show up. The last delay took about two weeks for many people. Another delay has started - which you are experiencing - only a few days after images began reappearing. <br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your correct 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.|`|PrZHEy6taa	Mines doing the exact same thing all of a sudden.

Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer.

7u77AiBjaa	There's no link to your 360 space in your question or your Y/A profile, so I can't easily confirm that you have one. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.|`|PrZHEy6taa	Look at the many questions on here on the same problem. See my pic??

AA12339318	It is Yahoo Answers users who report certain questions for deletions.  Often, no one at Yahoo actually looks at what was reported and the deletion is automatic.<br>  <br>  If you feel the question was not deleted for a good reason, you can appeal this to Yahoo Answers.  On the email that alerts you that your question was deleted, there is a link that takes you to a page where you can post your appeal.  When you do this, an actual person will read it and check out the posting that was deleted.  If they find that the deletion was in error, they will re post it.  If that person still finds that the question is in violation of the guidelines, the deletion remains.<br>  <br>  A helpful hint:  Copy and paste the portion of that violation notice that contains your question.  Paste it into the field where you get to explain your side of the issue.<br>  <br>  I have had a few answers deleted because someone reported then as being in violation of the guidlines.  I try VERY hard not to BE in violation, but sometimes, people are sensitive about certain subjects and may be offended.  But I challenge these deletions.  Sometimes it appears that the only reason an answer gets reported is because someone simply doesn't agree with the answer.<br>  <br>  Example:  A person asked what was the REAL hair color of one of the mythological Greek goddess.  She was concerned because she had seen pictures showing this goddess with different eye colors.  I answered that since this character was a fictional myth, there would be no "real" eye color.  She could be depicted in any eye color the artist chose.  My answer was deleted, I appealed, but, the result of my appeal was that the answer was found to be in violation of the guidelines.  I still can't figure that one out.<br>  <br>  But, most of the time, when I take the time to appeal, the question gets put back in.|`|pYe3kkgNaa	the same thing has happened to me loads of times, it other yahoo users that do the reporting,<br>  appeal and they will restore your question and give you back your points.<br>  remember to put in your question and explain that it wasn't against community guidlines

If it is I'm pretty sure it's a scam, usually these places will no ask for your password at any point.  If they just wanted your email address maybe it'd have some chance at being legit, but that sounds like a big scam.|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	Pretty sure it's fake. The reasons? It's asking for your password and the "Support Team" doesn't specify who they are--like "AOL Support Team" or "Gmail Support Team". Also, the email has poor grammar.<br>  <br>  Report the email as spam and do not reply to it.|`|WlliZdy1aa	Yeah, I got something like that a little while ago about an ATM card.<br>  <br>  If you don't know what they are talking about or who they are, just disregard it.<br>  It could be a virus.|`|ldi4iSgCaa	Well it depends what the persons email address is and what company the mails coming from.|`|AA12057499	don't do it, anything you ever sign up to and have to have a password for always says NEVER give out your password to ANYONE this includes the site you sign up to.if in doubt go the the site help page you can often ask questions or send the spam letter on to them for verififcation of it being genuine or spam. BUT PLEASE DON'T ANSWER IT.|`|njKzPg1uaa	Do you use Yahoo! mail? Well I highly doubt any email hoster would do that. I would regard it as spam and delete it.

I would strongly suggest not responding back, since they're the support team, they have the right to do whatever they please, and probably can get into your account and check to see if you have been active. So why would they need to send an e-mail saying that? They can just do it themselves and check without having to go through the trouble of typing that long paragraph.<br>  Also, if you are worried about loosing all your information, save all your important emails and put it somewhere safe on your computer/or write it down.

Answers badge (currently not possible for new blog entries) in Y!360, or otherwise communicates the location of the Yahoo! Answers profile to you, then you can't. <br>  <br>  Certainly, you can try searching for the person here. You can put the term - "Yahoo! Answers [the person's nickname]" - in the "Search for question" area at the top of most Y/A pages. (With quotes, minus the brackets). Then, you can narrow down who you are looking for from the results. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The person may not use the same nickname on Yahoo! Answers as they do on Yahoo! 360. Also, not everyone who uses Yahoo! 360, uses the Yahoo! Answers service. You can save yourself a lot of trouble by just asking the person for a link to their Y/A profile (if they have one) via 360 message or comment.
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is no way unless the person used their Yahoo ID as their Y!A Nickname. You do a Yahoo search on "answers NICKNAME" and one of the first entries will point to the profile.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> .

It may sound a little complicated, but it really isn't - I'm a senior citizen and successfully installed it today...:-) Now hop on over to Chatango and you'll be surprised - no more advertisements whatsoever, they are all blocked by your browser! Don't believe me? Then just take a look at this, it's a screenshot I took a few minutes ago:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://de..com/view.php?pic=k2zh8n&s=5" rel="nofollow">http://de..com/view.php?pic=k2zh8n&s=5</a> Note: Yahoo won't let me post the complete url for your picture, please insert "tinypic" between the 2 dots in the url.
