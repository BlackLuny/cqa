20090307085250AAjdmEe	Environment;Global Warming	Global Warming Question?	My question is this, everyday almost, where I'm at, the record highs are all in the 1930's...   For Example:   Yesterday: Record High- 78 (1934) Record Low- -13 (1986)   Today it is: Record High- 83 (1934) Record Low- -21 (1969)   I looked further and here's the record highs.   March 8: Record High 78 (1934)   March 9: Record High 69 (1938)   March 10: Record High 85 (1933)   March 11: Record High 79 (1937)   & so on... same way with January and February.   The 1930's must've been scorchers... where I'm at way up north, 85 degrees on March 10, 1933... wow!   No records have been set in the 2000's.   So my question is in the 1930's, Global Warming existed??
20090307085153AAF95yA	Environment;Green Living	Is it hard to recycle plastic?	Is recycling plastic difficult? I was at Lowe's the other day, and they had a recycled plastic tote. It was half the price of the same size non-recycled tote. I thought about buying it, but the texture was rough and sand papery, and there was this noxious odor emanating from it that actually made me cough a few times (I wasn't being dramatic, I was alone.) So in my head I thought to myself, is recycled plastic actually difficult to produce into a tolerable product, or are the big plastic companies trying to make me think this to make me shy away from recyclables, because both totes were made from the same manufacturer.

He refuses to turn off his laptop, television, playstation, even when hes asleep. Most of his stuff has now been on for 3 weeks constantly. He argues that there is no cost to us because our energy bill is included in our rent. Help me prove to him that its still worth saving energy and recycling.

I can't think straight right now, I'm so confused.       So if we have more alternative energy, why does that reduce our dependance on oil?       Thanks

20090307094854AAd6qTv	Environment;Other - Environment	What kind of animal could do this?	okay here's the story. My grandparents live out in the country. They own about 14 acers of woods. The rest is the neighbors ( its a lot of woods) They used to have goats and they went on vacation and my aunt was taking   care of them. she went to go check on the they were all just decapitated and blood everywhere. On the barn HUGE scratch marks were on it starting almost a the roof of it. Another time my grandparents and my sister were outside and they saw goat skulls in the back yard (was after the goats have been eaten and it wasn't their goats) One night my grandparents and cousin were at the house and right outside the window they hear heavy breathing. and a LOUD growl. They went out side and a big pile of animal flesh was there right in front of the house, It sounded almost like a bear they say. but bears really aren't in west Tennessee. They also always here lady screams but they sounded nonhuman, they are loud too./  They do have some type of i guess you could call them witch people that live near them. what could this possibly be?? Its all very gruesome.

Hey, so I have a riddle I need to solve for my Humans and the Environment lecture and I've been trying to figure it out for about a week but I am totally stumped. So here's the riddle      What three common *THINGS* beginning with the letter "C" have the most significant global effect?      The hints are, 1) It is not a chemical name or concept 2) Each thing starts with the letter "C" and is one word in length. 3) each thing can be touched.      I think "Cars" is one of the answers but I don't know I'm completely stumped.      PLEASE HELP!
