nxeQFPEfaa	They wont do a 10 inch small PAN...trust me [[if you don't believe me then ask!]]<br>  They will only do Pan on a medium or large not the small. But out of your three options I would still get this option. The sandwiches are so freaking amazing. My fave is italian and chicken bacon ranch. The Brooklyn style is too floppy, lol and why get only a large pizza when you can a couple of slices of pizza AND some of a delicious sandwich? Happy eating.|`|YlyN73Jnaa	Option 3: A Large Pizza. It will take you on a cheesy vacation trip to heaven. It's worth every penny.|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	brooklyn stlyle|`|GHd84xipaa	i would go for the sub and some chips.|`|NNFIqEMGaa	You should get the large pizza because it is bigger and you can choose any combination like pepperoni|`|Ed1ojicIaa	Brooklyn Pizza !!!!!|`|GAVYUZy5aa	I enjoy the Brooklyn Style Pizza.|`|Az4uH0H2aa	Are you trying to get fat?|`|VvbOSbRnaa	I would say option 1 would be the most filling. You are getting the most for your money and more than likely you will have plenty of leftovers for the next day! :)|`|NZt26n6haa	Option 1 sounds the most fillling but i would get Option 3 and eat it all by myself!! hehehee

a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	The base is full of white flour which is full of bad carbs.  They load the cheese on which is full of fat, then there is the pepperoni which is fat.  They probably cook the veggies in fat.   There is a zillion calories in it.<br>  I love Pizza but I make my own with a whole wheat base, little cheese and lots of veggies that have been steamed and served with a huge salad.  Plus we only eat a slice of pizza not the whole thing.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Nothing. It is just that we eat too much of it.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	The worst part about pizza is the grease from the cheese and any meats on it. The sauce has a lot of carbohydrates and so does the crust. Pizza isn't bad for you if you eat a slice here and there or skip the pepperoni and get some veggies on it. Some chain places like Pizza Hut load the pans up with grease so the dough soaks it up which is kinda gross. For the most part, veggies on pizza are fresh and cook in the oven with the exception of mushrooms, olives, artichokes, and pineapple, they are usually canned.|`|hcgaizJCaa	It's not bad for you at all if you get veggie pizza with thin crust. Cheese is fattening, but dairy is still good for you.|`|39e2c4fcb4d615bba14862aadd5276bdaa	Some pizzas have lots of oil on it even by just looking at it|`|G1dG9tC0aa	Nothing<br>  All things in moderation|`|JTjL9eD7aa	The dough is merely an "empty" carbohydrate that has no nutrients in it. Dairy, regardless of public conception, is not healthy and in fact is linked to many diseases and medical conditions. Even if vegetables are added, by the time they are cooked in the oven, nutrients are for the most part "cooked out". Cons most certainly out-weigh pros.|`|zTKkH2iBaa	i think it depends on how much cheese<br>  i have these co-op pizza slices<br>  and they are alright<br>  its portion size<br>  one of my slices is enough for a meal<br>  and is less than 300 calories|`|zbPNN4Ndaa	Mainly the reason why pizza is unhealthy is because of the cheese and the oil and the grease.|`|LMNHj66baa	it's fattening. the cheese, the dough, and the oil are are fattening and in large amounts bad for your heart.|`|Kk8gnQPiaa	Yes, get veggies only on it.  Get whole wheat crust.  That's the healthiest you can get.|`|gC98RlU3aa	the oil and grease have a lot of fat and it depends on the thickness of the crust.

They don't seem to realize that the only way servers are making any money is by tips, and their regular wage isn't enough to support anything.|`|8V38MYL3aa	I want to make it clear that I DO tip when I go to restaurants but if you think about it the owners should pay their staff a good wage in the first place.   Lots of people work in the hospitality trade and DON'T get tipped depending on what type of job it is.   In some Countries it is a sign of bad manners to tip.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Some are just cheap,some take out their frustrations of a bad meal,or long wait to get their food on the server.I agree whole heartedly that if you go out to eat you should consider a tip as part of the cost.<br>  <br>  Being friendly has more to do with a tip than service in my opinion.|`|r4N245AOaa	because people are trying to get out as cheap as possible! i work at my dads restraunt.. and people complain about paying 8 dollars for a meal and a drink... 8 stinking dollars! it makes me so mad! when i go out to eat i dont even look at the prices b/c i dont care! if i was that hard up i wouldnt be eating out, i would be at home saving money, but they want to go out and eat a big meal, then when the check comes they want to cry and whine about it, so of course there not even gonna think about tipping! freakin jerks... ugh...|`|o9p5kn1Baa	I always feel really bad if I dont tip, but i hope you know that most people tip according to what kind of service they get|`|rz6l19vlaa	Because you get paid to do this job, and do it well, only if you REALLY provided an exceptional service I would give a tip around 5% to 10% depending on the bill.<br>  <br>  Do I get a tip by doing my job? no, I get paid to do it. and many people eating out earns the same money as you do and get no tips. Some jobs will give you a bonus of you exceed any predetermine targets, but you have to work you behind really hard to do it.<br>  <br>  So you will have to work your behind really, really hard to offer the best possibly service and to EXCEED customers expectations, and I'm not talking about just saying hello, "may I take your order".. or "did you like the food?" I am talking about personalized greeting, a genuine smile and show that you really care for your customer.|`|Z1dLsDdtaa	In some countries it is impolite because you are telling them thery will soon be out of work since your serving is so bad|`|JfVxCDb7aa	I always do !!!<br>  <br>  some people have no class I guess.

hhWDHmfyaa	30 years ago while I was waitressing to pay for college, I worked in a very upscale restaurant.  The fact that it was so refined only makes this worse as the folks around the customer fled the restaurant.<br>  <br>  An ederly gentlemen wanted to send back his food.  I asked him why.  He screamed that it tasted like crap loud enough to be heard in 3 states.  He then vomitted on the floor.  When he finished wretching, he took a sip of water and proceeded to keep eating.<br>  <br>  I was only 19 at the time.  The manager/owner had all ready been standing by myside when the guy started screaming.  It was too much for me so I went into the kitchen.  The manager/owner started to clean up the mess, then handed the elderly gent a knapkin and suggested that  he get to work.  He, and a few dozen other folks, simply left without paying.  It was a complete fiasco.|`|6WdgA94Qaa	I know this is awfully long to read but it is definitely worth it. I seriously doubt that anyone has a better horror story than this! I wasn't a waiter but I will answer this anyway. It was back in the early 90's. I was a waitress/assistant manager at a family restaurant, I had a six table section. Three tables had enough seats for 2 to 4 and the other three were 6 to 8 people tables. At the time they were all full.It was a Friday night and there was a fifteen minute wait at the door. I had just finished serving the entree to the last table which had 7 people at it. I served everyone at the table and when I asked if I they needed anything else for now they said they were fine. So I went back to doing other things while they started their meals. Next thing I knew, the eldest gentleman ( most likely the Dad, seeing that there were children and a lady whom I assumed was the Mom) yells at me from the other side of the restaurant "Hey lady get over here now!" I rushed right over to see what was the problem. He takes his plate and shoves it in my face literally and says" Look at that does that look appetizing to you?" I said "Yes sir it does." Because it did it was just spaghetti. He then proceeded to tell me how disgusting it was, very loudly and rudely. So I offered him a a choice to pick something else or to have the cook prepare a new dish. He said "No I don' t want the same **** again!" and threw the plate at me. He then said " I will pick something else." By this time I was already pretty upset but I kept my composure. He also added that if he had to wait for new food then his family should have their food recooked too. So I obliged. Because like they say the customer is always right. When the cooks were  done fairly quickly I might add.  I served the table again and once again asked" Is there anything else I can get you?" And of course they said everything was good. I hadn't gotten 10 feet away when the man beckoned for me again. This time he asked for the manager. Which happened to be me that night." I said is there another problem?" He said " Yes, this **** sucks, we're never coming in here again!" I apoligized for the food and took care of his bill myself." He then proceeded to tell me that it wasn't the food it was the service. I was appalled I politely asked him to finish up and please exit the restaurant. He then stood up and started throwing punches at me. Only one actually hit me. Right in the face my cheekbone was broken and I had a black eye right away. I was just going to walk away but I let my anger get the best of me and I tackled him to the ground got on top of him and started to pummel him as hard and as fast as I could. His wife tried to get me off of him but I was'nt moving she had a good hold on my hair. In the meantime the cops had already been called. A couple of the male customers had to pull me off of this man because I was not going to stop. Finally the police came and got everyones story and off he went to jail. Because I pressed charges. At the time I was 21 the man was 52. I also was fired for fighting on the job. They said if I had not fought back I would have been able to keep my job.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	I had a customer change a baby's diaper on the table, then leave the dirty diaper under the table.

You can always complain to corporate KFC, though.  Don't waste your time screaming at the teenager working the register...|`|KqdhWG1maa	Well here in Canada KFC has what they call Tooney Tuesday.  A tooney is slang for $2 but KFC's Tooney Tuesday costs  $2.49<br>  Total Deceit!|`|WT0dGgoMaa	Well, question, do they actually call it a "99cent menu"????<br>  <br>  A lot of people used to assume that Wendy's had a 99 cent menu, because at one time, all of the items were indeed only 99 cents on it. HOWEVER, the truth is, it was NEVER called a 99 cent menu. It was called a SUPER VALUE MENU. and as the economy changed, some of the prices went up, and people were enraged that the 99 cent menu (that never actually existed) was gone.<br>  <br>  Or if they do call it that, always read the fine print. Almost all sales and advertisements specify "At participating locations."|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Number 1 - you may have noticed that most national advertising includes the caveat "at participating stores" or something to that effect, so the 99-cent menu may be different at different restaurants, but they could also simply define the "value menu" as being just those items priced at 99 cents.<br>  I checked their main website and it is not a "99 cent value menu."  It's a Value Menu "starting at" 99 cents.  Better learn to read advertisments more closely.  They're doing it in a completly correct manner.|`|AA11850523	read the wording<br>  it says menu STARTING at 99 cents<br>  <br>  deceiving but legal|`|AA11603529	Actually. The commercials and menu boards claim that the menu STARTS at 99 cents. Which it does. Strawberry and choclate parfaits, two biscuits and a KFC snacker sandwhich are all 99 cents. Then it goes to $1.69 items then $2.49 items.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	IDK about that but some of the things they offer for the lower prices are a joke...like that thing that they call a 'side salad'|`|b1w5FUGzaa	the commerical says "starting at 99 cents* in small print, you have to read carefully !|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	The commercials and ads say that the menu STARTS at 99 cents...|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	no they have the little lines on the bottom of everything saying price my varies

zKgzTNpKaa	Hi,<br>  First thing: McDonald has 2 seperate divisions in India one is North Zone and the other is West Zone.<br>  There is still no McD in South India and East India. Since, it is not expecting any need or business opoortunity there.<br>  <br>  Hence, as India is quite diversed country then the prices of North Zone and West Zone is quite different.<br>  <br>  Second thing:<br>  There is no online pricing available since, they change there pricing very very frequently in India because of various weather seasons.<br>  <br>  Say for example:<br>  Icecream Cone is Rs.15 these days(Warm Winters) but will be Rs.10 in summers.<br>  <br>  the most common pricing here:<br>  McVeggie ~Rs.30 (70 cents)<br>  McMaharaja ~Rs.50 ($ 1)<br>  Large Fries ~ Rs.40<br>  Soft Drink ~ Rs.20<br>  Happy Meal ~Rs.50-60 (~$1)<br>  Combos from Rs.30-Rs.70<br>  <br>  I hope this will help.|`|OJFkEIu0aa	the potato burger is 20 rupees and chinese burger is 35 rupees|`|2xmW4eo0aa	McDonalds.in|`|midmBgJJaa	Price list is here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2303069/Case-McDonalds-India-Launch" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/2303069/Case-M...</a><br>  <br>  See pages 14 onward.
