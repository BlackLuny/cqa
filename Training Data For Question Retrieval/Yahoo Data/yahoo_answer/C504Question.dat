20090220134603AAg4sua	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Self breast exams, ladies?	Ladies, do you do self breast exams?  There is an extremely deadly type of breast cancer that can be easily detected.  It is called 'inflammatory breast cancer'.  It does not start out as a lump.  It starts out as a sore, or inflammation on the outside of the breast.  If not detected extremely early it moves to a major organ rapidly, such as the liver.  There is little publicity about this type of cancer, but we just lost our 45 year old daughter-in-law to this deadly disease. She was a nurse, and altho she got an early diagnosis, the disease had already spread to her liver.  And then later on to her brain, and then to her spine.  Do YOU do your own self exams?

I ate a lot. I was so full. And I went home and threw up like fifteen to twenty times.      -Thursday, I threw up half a pizza and three whole tacos.      -A little bit ago, I ate pizza and breadsticks(really fast) and threw it all up.      -My throat hurts bad and my stomach does too.      I've never used laxatives. I've only thrown up, fasted, and excerseized excessively. I've thrown up with one finger, two fingers, my whole hand, and a toothbrush.

After spending 20 minutes circling the parking lot for an empty space, I tried two pharmacies down the street then three more in another neighborhood near a local hospital.

I think I should go see a doctor, but what are the treatments going to involve?
20090220135207AAsKmPr	Health;Mental Health	My house is apparently haunted. Anyone ever experience anything like that?	Friday morning, 2/13/09, my daughter  put her cell phone down on top of her work out clothes by the front door. She went to eat breakfast, came back and it was gone. My oldest daughter was upstairs and my youngest was already at school. No one touched it. We looked all morning and that evening and never found it. She found it in the playroom, on top of my 9 year old's bookshelf, in the corner. We had looked there several times. Also, on Friday afternoon, my husband got home from work (he was alone), walked in the house and heard someone walking around upstairs, then a door slam. He went upstairs to find nothing. All the doors were open and no one was there. The next day (Saturday, 2/14/09), I went upstairs to my bathroom and felt a chill all over my body, I started shaking and ran downstairs. Saturday night, my kids were visiting their dad, so we left our bedroom door open. We fell asleep and hubby woke up at 3am to the sounds of little footsteps running into our bedroom, then it stopped and he felt a chill all over his body. During that same night I was awakened (but never opened my eyes - I was too scared), to a sensation on my stomach area. It felt like a cat was brushing up against my stomach and then between my back and my husband. The sensation went back and forth (much like an animal does when it's trying to get comfortable), then it finally settled down against my stomach (I was sleeping on my side with my husband holding me. I prayed a prayer, started to go back to sleep and heard a purring sound. Sunday night (2/15/09), 2 of my 3 kids were home for the night. My daughter, Jordan, was home alone while my husband and youngest went out for a bit. While we were gone, my middle child felt chills all over her body. She rushed up to her room and locked herself in. When she got in her room, she heard creeks in the hallway, like something was walking around. She turned on the radio to mask the noise and took a shower, all the while shaking like a leaf. When we returned home, my oldest daughter's light and fan were on full blast (she wasn't home and hadn't been home all weekend). That same night, my youngest (9 yrs old), couldn't sleep. We finally got her to sleep and I went to bed. As soon as we settled down to sleep, our room was quiet, we heard footsteps outside our bedroom door. Then we heard a little girls' voice and a knock. My husband checked to see if it was my daughter, but it wasn't (she was asleep). She eventually ended up coming to our door an hours later & knocked. My husband put her back to bed and came to bed. I was asleep during this time. Finally, she came in at 245am and I told my husband I would put her back to sleep. I laid down in her bed and I heard the creaking of the floor again, but this time in her room. My husband told me the next day that once I left, the noises and the creaking outside in the hallway stopped. Whatever it was, I believe followed me into my daughter's room. He came for me 10 min later to have me come back to bed and my daughter woke up. I told her to come sleep with us because we all had to get some sleep. She came in our bed, snuggled up and fell back asleep. As soon as she fell asleep, my husband and I heard a purring sound - the same sound I had heard the night before when I felt that sensation all over my body. Finally it ceased and we all went to sleep.       Monday night (2/16/09)- my daughter's were at their dad's house for the night. We went to bed at 10pm. Before we laid down in the bed, I told my husband to sit on the bed real quiet and see if any of the noises started. We sat for a couple of minutes, but heard nothing. We got ready for bed, laid down, and within minutes, the creaking outside our locked bedroom door started. No one was home. It sounded the same as the night before, like something was walking around right outside our bedroom door. We laid there for a minute, said a prayer and my husband fell asleep. Once her started snoring, I could hear the creaking, but it got louder. I said out loud, "I have got to get some sleep." The noises ceased and I slept all night with no problems. Tuesday night, 2/17/09 -  My in-laws came over and we anointed every doorway with oil and prayed over each room. We blessed the house, basically. That night we slept so sound. No noises. Nothing. It was awesome. Wednesday, 2/18/09 - We went to sleep and we heard noises again. Creaks, but this time they were different. We thought it was perhaps the wind, because that was the night of the tornadoes and thunderstorms. Thursday morning (2/19/09) - my youngest came in at 630am and said she had a nightmare that my hubbay and I died and she had to go live with her daddy. She was very sad. Thursday night, 2/19/09 - We set up a camera in the hallway (as suggested by many websites), to pick up any sound. We left the camera on for 25 minutes. When we watched it, we heard 4 popping / creaking sounds, that were picked up on the camera - They registered on our tape at these time fram

20090220135527AAkyo4k	Health;Women's Health	While having sex with my husband last night, - really terrible - what happened?!?	I was not too much in the mood. However, he kissed and cuddled me a bit and we started to do it. We used a condom, which was still on him at the end - and we have used these condoms before. He took me a little deep, and all of a sudden I felt these cramps.    In a matter of seconds I felt like screaming. I felt like I was having really bad period cramps - just to tell you how bad, I lay still and didnt move. I was literally half sitting up gripping the bedhead and side table. The pain went through the muscles in my back and around my tail bone and at the front where normal period pain is as well.    I begged him to run to the store (at midnight) and get me pain killers. The pain came in waves.       After about an hour it stopped. The waves got smaller and smaller.    Today (next day) my stomach feels a bit jelly like - you know after you run a mile, and your legs feel like jelly? yeah. that.       Could I be in the very early stages of pregnancy and just experienced an almost miscarriage? NOTHING came out the whole time.. no blood.. etc. I am due to start my period in another 4 or so days.       Any ideas about what the hell that was?   Im pressing lightly on my lower abdomen now. It feels so strange.

20090220140936AAMZTEf	Health;Mental Health	Why has this occurred?	Since I was about 7 I have always been fine with watching things with monsters since I use to watch things like Buffy all the time. In ny teen years have watched a number of horror movies which I shrug off and have a laugh at....      So why is it now I am having problems going to sleep. Have never been afraid of the dark then one day early last year it freaked me out, even to walk in it scares me which it never use to....    Only a couple of weeks ago was it when I got the feeling im not alone in my bedroom [even when my b/f is lying next to me and gets shivers being on the end of the bed than the side by the wall]. I have the thoughts of seeing the girls from The Ring, The Grudge and The Exorcist in my room which I have clear space and space under the bed in which I expect to find this creature from a fake advert [screamer type thing] crawl from under.       I use to see spirits/ghosts whatever you like to call them since I was 8 till 16 and never had a problem with that when it occurred at night times. I need to know what has brought on this Psychological effect, its really starting to bug me thinking about when i next go to bed that i'll eventually be seeing these things for real and f**king my head up!!!

20090220135511AAvqIgg	Health;Alternative Medicine	What's the worst trip you have had on Marijuana?	I smoked a blunt the other day. It was packed with "Master Blue". (one strain from many that exist of marijuana) So I smoked it just as I had done many other times. I'm in my car chilling, I saw a cop car just drive by and park a distance from me. By this time I was already done with the blunt so I was just chilling listening to music thinking and what not. All of a sudden I just started to loose it. The cop I'm guessing was going to eat at one of the restaurants around or something. So he was just chilling in his car for a while. I dunno what he was doing inside but all of a sudden I see him look back and BAM!! I lost it!! I started tripping out like I have never tripped out before. I believed that I was being set up for an arrest. I was like WTF!! Even though I had already finished it, didn't smell around because by the time he got there I had moved from where I originally had done the deed. So anyways I'm freaking out. So, I notice a movie theater right across from me. I decided the best thing to do is get out of the car, so they wont think I'm driving like this. So I proceed to get out of the car and I'm sweating my hands are super cold. I had some shades on the whole time. But before I got out of the car. I had put some eye drops for when I got into the theater. So I manage to walk towards the theater and the whole time I'm walking, I feel like the cops are following me. I look behind me and nothing you know? But I was convinced that they were. So I get in, watch the movie and I don't know why the security guard at the theater walks into the screen that I'm watching the movie in. It was a new release so there was lots of people there. I'm guessing he was just checking up. But I was tripping because I thought he was sent in by the cops to locate me. So I'm scared out of my mind now cuz I'm thinking I'm going to go to jail and stuff. In my rush of picking a movie, I picked a random one and it was a chick flick. So now I'm like man this movie is playing the story of my love life. So I start to trip out on the movie thinking someone made it because they knew my life. Plus I'm freaking out on the thought that the cops are waiting for me outside the movie theater. I was just awful! I had never experience anything quiet like it b4 and I've been a user for about 2 months now. I consume maybe about 2 times a day regularly. I guess what I want to know is. Did I have a panic attack did just freak out. Or is that strain of bud really potent and makes you trip out sick???? LOL I hope you guys enjoyed my story. It's funny as hell to me now since I know I was tripping out and stuff. But I would like to know what my fellow consumers think. Or if they have anything even crazier which I'm sure they do. HEHE :)

20090220140008AAKDB76	Health;Women's Health	Why is my vag swollen and uncomfortable?	im young and unexperienced but not a virgin... ive only done it a few times before (with my boyfriend). last time my boyfriend and i did it, it felt weird. i felt something very warm coming out of me like i was peeing. then he realized the condom (which had spermicide) broke. he didn't ***, just precum. anyways, a day later my vag was uncomfortable and a bit itchy (but not anything unbareble). i rubbed it and then it got swollen and the itching worsened (and a bit burning when i pee sometimes). its been a few days now and yesturday i noticed a white substance, looked like water-down milk, dripping out. today i noticed small white particles, looked like super fine chopped cottage cheese or something, but not a a lot. could this be a yeast infection?  if so, what should i do about it?  or could it be an allergic reaction to the spermicide? a few hours ago i used some stuff like vagisil that said it helps sooths the symptoms i mentioned above... and so far it stopped itching at least. going to a gyno isnt an option for me (i would die if my parents knew), but what could be the consequences? will it go away on its own? HELP! please?!?! im scared. :(

They ended up having to remove my left tube.  I wanted pictures, notes and everything that I could possibly get to help understand what happened, why it happened, and what was done during the surgery.  I received notes and photos from the surgery the day I was released from the hospital.  They were confusing and didn't make sense to my husband and I so I took them to my follow up appointment to ask questions.  They told me that there was a typo in the notes that I had and the dictation (another set of notes) from the surgery had the correct information. Why or how did the doctor's make a typo in one set of notes and not the other?  Should I be upset?  Yes the typo was something major.
20090220143801AAIU9ok	Health;Mental Health	WHY why why why why why why?	do some people get popular when others don't?   I mean, this girl Jordan is a total *****. She treats people like ****, and pretends to be their friend and then talks about them right away. She lies and is all around dumb and yet people are attracted to her and talk to her and want to be her friend when they don't even know her versus me when I am not any of those things. I usually get ignored. Some girl that was talking to Jordan was all nice to her and happy and obviously wanted to be her friend and all I did was say one thing to her and she totally ignored me. Everytime I try to talk to her she treats me like ****. I don't even know her and she doesn't even know me!!      I feel like a child with my baby sitter and the babysitter's friends are too old to talk to ME and talk down to me though we are all the same age!!!      This isn't a guilt trip about me I just want to know why.   For instance, I put on my best dress and I looked great and I feel I am very pretty. I have been offered Modeling jobs before and I was out with my friend who no one thinks is very pretty at all yet she was getting hit on and I wasn't.      WHY why why.   At this point I am starting to think that it is my personality.   I tried to change it. I tried to change me. I have tried and tried but then I thought, why should I?   And I still get ignored, and mistreated and I still want to change But I shouldn't have to. Why does this happen?

[girls only!]?	last week i went to the gyno because my birth control pill wasn't working 'well'. i would always start bleeding at random times and it was really inconvenient. so my doctor gave me a new kind to test out, and she told me to finish the old birth control pack i was on, then start the new one..   welllll, my mom decided instead of finishing my old birth control, i would start the new one. well, pretty much since i've started taking this new one i've been bleeding heavy every single day, i've been having terrible cramps and back pain and it dosen't seem to be stopping..it's only continuing and getting worse.      how long is this going to go on!? i've been on this new bc for over a week, about 2 weeks and my bleeding and cramps and back pain are only getting worse!    ugh..what can i do? even taking pills that are made to help the cramps and stuff arn't helping at all!

20090220143023AAzvxp2	Health;Mental Health	Is my life over? Do I even have a future?	I have no life. I'm stuck in this neighborhood that might as well be a ghetto. I envy the hooligan across the street and his drug addict mother because they at least have a life.      I can't drive because of my anxiety. I have Asperger's Syndrome and OCD which I had to take medication for.   I also have acid reflux now and have to take Zantac twice a day. I am not taking my Zoloft and Risperdal because I do not want to take four medications a day. The only time when it is okay and normal to take four pills a day is when you're old or dying. I'm 20 years old despite living the life of an overprotected 12-year-old and feeling as jaded as a middle aged person. It's pathetic how the average 12-year-old could run circles around me socially.      I have a feeling that I'm going to be alone, unemployed and living with my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents will think that I'm a bigger failure and disappointment than they already do. I can't even keep a minimum wage job as I'm socially dense and my anxiety shakes me up to the point where I can't even concentrate on the simplest things.      I can't transfer to a school in a stimulating city because I have a crappy 2.8 GPA and my parents are too busy paying for the tuition of my sister's prestigious college. I'm not good at anything that will help me make money and have a lucrative career. I fail at math and science. Nothing I'm good at counts for anything.      I can't talk to my school counselor because they are only watchdogs who make sure that everyone that visits them is not the next Cho Seung Hui from Virginia Tech. When I told them about my intrusive, disturbing thoughts last summer, they shipped me off to the mental hospital where I ended up for over six hours. I was too scared to call my parents. I feared that they would either get mad at me or cry. I've never seen my mom cry before and I did not want this to be the first time.      My parents found out and all hell broke lose. After an agonizing search for a professional, we found a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist was the first person to take our insurance AND be able to write a letter to the school saying that I'm fine.      I'm tired of this crap. When is the next time I'm going to get hospitalized? I remember being forced to see a psychiatrist when I got into a fight in high school. What am I going to get diagnosed with next? Even my mother said I have caused problems since day one because I stopped talking at 18-months-old and did not speak again because of autism, how I was forced to go to a special ed.school throughout elementary school.      My mind is garbage and hell. I'm stuck in this bland, stifling town where the only stimulation is the fist fights that happen sometimes and how the thugs are so professional and advanced that they could dodge the cops minutes before they show up and never get arrested for their drugs and mini-riots when they do.   Sometimes I feel I'm too good for this, yet I feel that I deserve this and this is my place in the world. Is there anyway I can escape my situation?

've been seeing my boyfriend for awhile now, and things are going great and we've looked at rings and are picking out a place, so everything is moving along great. He's a terrific sweet loving man and I adore him.      But theres one issue Im having problems with. He'd really like us to watch porn together. I have no moral issue with porn (hell, we made one of our own) but watching other people do it just isnt my thing. He says it'd be a good educational experience and would be hot.      My big issue with it is it makes me feel like Im not sexy enough or our sex life isnt hot enough to get him turned on on its own. I've voiced this to him multiple times and he says Im interpreting his desire to watch it with me incorrectly. Im not sure how else to take it. Im also irritated because a few weeks ago this came up and I asked if he was watching it anymore and he said no. Then today hes like "sorry babe I am I guy and I do watch it". When I asked why he told me he wasnt watching it anymore he said "well at the time you asked I wasnt". Caught me on a technicality.      Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Any advice? The whole thing just makes me feel very unsexy and un-needed

It was supposed to be done in the office but due to some complications, it was scheduled as an outpatient procedure.       It took me forever to wake up from GA, it took 2 different kinds on nausea medicine to make me not be nauseous. I finally went home 5 hours after the procedure was done. I slept most of the day. Discharge paperwork was not gone over with me, so I went to work for 1/2 a day on Wed.       Problem: my face ended up swollen real bad, difficulty breathing, stomach looks like I am 6 months pregnant and my whole right side (leg mostly) is also swollen. I went to urgent care they didn't say anything was wrong.       What is going on? I have had 2 c-sections and a hysterectomy and never had anything like this.

Because of that, I now have stretch marks from my knees TO my upper butt. My entire thigh is covered! And since this happened when I was young, i didnt know about creams that could diminish the appearance, so now my stretch marks are really deep, 5 inches long around my butt, and all silvery. Think zebra...or washboard. This problem has prevented me from wearing skirts or shorts, and getting close to guys. My self esteem...pssh, it has died. So what do guys think about them?

20090220151928AA23US6	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Is this operator error (Accucheck Compact Plus)?	On the advice of Y/A, I called the company and swapped out meters.  I was getting random numbers sometimes, and the variance would be greater than 200 points.        The new meter came a couple weeks ago, but it's still happening.  Only when the reading comes back "HI" though.  If I take it again it'll come down 300 points (HI is over 600 on this meter).        The user/diabetic is 6 and checks her own sugar most of the time.  So I'm thinking this is operator error (what are the odds we'd get two funky meters).  But what could she be doing that'd cause it?        Other than, it's not that she's filling the strip before it's ready.  She waits for the signal that it's ready.  Can too much blood do it?  She has a tendency to draw a huge drop then drag her finger on the strip.

20090220144146AAsZKxv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What is wrong with me?	So around the time I was 17 I started smoking cigarettes and went through an EXTREMELY stressful time. After the stress started to calm down and the smoking decreased I noticed some changes. That I had lost tons of weight even though my eating habits never changed, I eat a pound of food a day and still won't gain a pound. My thick hair became thinned out and started falling out, My heart beats rapidly Im overly anxious and my eyesight is fuzzy and weird. Im now 18 and Im a little puzzled by why this would all happen, my first guess is the smoking and stress triggered graves disease which then caused Hyperthyroidism. So I have a doctors appointment.       Any thoughts or guesses?

Im 12 almost 13 and i don't have my period yet, but i have been having discharge for over 6 months and it started when my boobs budded. My mom got her period really late (like 15 or 16) and my older sis got it at 13. I am more like my mom and my sister is more like my dad. So my question is if Im going to have discharge until I am 15 or 16 (when i get my period) because even right now i can feel it (really gross) every time i get it (pretty much every day at school).   My second question has nothing to do with periods, but with my boobs. When they budded in 6th grade they didn't really turn hershey kissed shaped but more like the nipples just stick out and my boobs are just flat. Also i don't remember where i got it but it was around the time they budded...my boobs hurt like every time anything touches them....something i guess hit me and let a huge bruise on the circular part thing and it still hasn't gone away. (it looks kinda weird) will it go away eventually?

20090220150304AAl9qXI	Health;Women's Health	Few things I need to ask about Masturbation.?	Greetings. I have a question that I need to ask you. I have picked up some things from this site here talking about it.       http://www.bible.com/bibleanswers_result...       Not only that, I managed to pick up a few versus that may be significant to masturbation. I want to know if these have a relevance to masturbation.      1 Corinthians 6:18 (NIV) further confirms this, saying that unlawful sexual relations defile our own bodies. "Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body."         Here's another one:      Matthew 5:30: "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to go into Hell". Is that refering to masturbation, since most people like myself who masturbate are right handed, & some that say, that you're committing adultery by your hand?      What do you think? Answers will be appreciated. Thanks! Even if it's a sin, I think that it's not a serious sin compared to other things. I'm very positive that it's not a sin, though.

20090220151459AAHUQt1	Health;Other - Health	Is there anything i can do to fix my toenails?	A few years ago i wore a pair of heels out which were too small. The next morning i realised that both my big toenails had broken over half way down the nail, due to them being pushed against the front of the shoes all night. They had been forward and after dancing all night they just eventually broke. The problem is that they still randomly break in the same place every few months now. Is this because the nail bed is permanently damaged or is there something i can do. This repeated breakage has nothing to do with my footwear, it just happens.      I also have another toe which every few months completly 'comes off' leaving just a thin layer of nail but this wasnt caused by any damage so do i just have extremely weak nails? My fingernails are always strong and my toenails do not chip or break apart from as i have described therefore i dont feel that strengthening nail products will make a difference.

20090203045601AAxy6lh	Health;Women's Health	Strange pins and needles feeling in arms after sexual activity with boyfriend?	I'm seventeen years old, and I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now. Recently (ie,within the past couple of months), we have become more curious/confident in terms of sexual activity, and have done what I would consider to be everything except oral and vaginal sex. Point of the question is, and this has happened at least twice now, when he stimulates my clitoris for a while, I suddenly feel almost a loss of sensation in both of my arms from the elbows down; it feels exactly like pins and needles. This lasts for quite a few minutes, and my hands feel very tingly for a while. However, it doesn't hurt, it just feels a bit strange.      Is this:      a) An orgasm?   b) What precedes an orgasm?   c) Something else entirely?      And just another question, I guess I'd know if I had an orgasm, right?

Ok, my period started on Sunday, and the doc had told me (and the directions on the bc pills said the same thing) to start the pill on the Sunday after your period starts, so even if your period starts on Sunday, you start the pill that SAME day.  Anyway, I don't get that, isn't my cycle going to be screwed up now?  Instead of getting my period again in 4 more weeks, I'll get it in 3?  Because if I get it again while I'm taking the sugar pills, that's in 3 more weeks...I'm just a little confused...I would think I would start the pill THIS Sunday, but like I said, the doc and instructions both said start it on Sunday after period begins, even if it's that same day.

I know the doctor's the expert, but I want to know what the possibilities are so I can tell if he's bullshitting me because I'm 16.       I've heard of xanax and valium. They seem pretty strong, and I don't know if there are any that are less strong and addictive.       And no crappy advice about practicing lots, breathing deeply, etc. If it helped, I wouldn't be asking.

Just in the past month i've started getting a clear stringy kind of discharge. I haven't had any problems with urinating or had any itching or sore parts. Although i am completely freaked about having a possible STD. :(  As I have had unprotected sex, which i know for my age is not a clever thing to do. This was a good 5 months ago though and i have had a regular period since then.       I  have a complete fear of being diagnosed with an std and really do not want to go the doctors until i have done some research and discovered wether or not it's just the fact that i am young and my bodies hormones have not settled properly yet or that i could be facing having to get treatment for a stupid mistake i have made previously.         If anyone has got any further information that could help me in diagnosing my problem please come forward. If i cannot get any good evidence or facts though i will need to go for a check-up.

Anorexic!?	yesterday i didn't eat at all, i had an issue with my stomach and i couldn't handle food. then today i skipped breakfast, like every other day. But i have been eating less and less.      In total i probably work out for like 2 hours a day, then maybe i eat a 1/4 of dinner rather than what normal people consume, usually i don't eat lunch and sometimes i can get away without eating dinner at all. Food scares me, i see food as fat, my entire family is overweight, and on the verge of being obese, it terrifies me. Ever since i was little i promised myself that i would do anything and everything to make sure i wouldn't end up like them. I have tried to throw up my food, that scared me as well, i can't anyway, im defective or something. since august i have been kind of anorexic, but i somewhat realize that and am trying to eat, it's just really hard, i don't want my body to go into starvation mode.      Yes i am depressed, because of my crappy school. Anyway please no lectures, just some nice advice.   Today i sat in front of the fridge and picked up food but was not able to put it in my mouth. I ended up crying for like 15 minutes. Every time i find a reason to eat i find an excuse to not eat the food, even if it's celery.

I haven't gained weight, I don't think, but I have gained fat. My lower stomach has fat in it. I want it away! I've tried crunches, leg lifts, stationary bike and nothing seems to work. I've burned about 100 calories on the stationary bike today, which isn't much. I don't want to lose much weight because I'm already on the verge of being underweight. My ribs show kinda, so I don't want to lose much weight. But on the other hand, I don't wanna gain any weight at all. I tried eating lettuce, it has a 'negative' calorie value. So I'll eat that and drink water. Apples have low calories too, would this help me lose the fat? Would crunches and leg lifts help? Or would the fat just stay. Thanks a ton(:      btw - I'm 5'0 (60 inches) and 85 pounds, my bmi is 16.6

For 4 years, didn't have a single injury. About 6 months ago, a friend and I started to run again after about a year or so of not running at all. Everything was fine. Got up to about 45 min of a good workout, which sometimes included hills and what not. We stopped running about 4 months ago.       Last week, I started training for the LA race for the cure 5k next month (ouch). On my first workout, I got up to about 15-20 minutes, and my calves were extremely tight. I decided that I ran enough, stretched, and finished the workout. The next day, same feeling, but a little earlier; no later than 15 minutes. The next day, about 10 minutes. The next day, I go about 5 minutes and my calves are killing me.        I decided to take a week off. I always eat healthy and drink lots of water, but I made sure I was 100% on top of it during this week. Today, went out there, and about 10 minutes in, the same feeling.      I stretch my legs for a good 10 minutes before running (after about a 1 min warmup), which includes two different kinds of calf stretches. I really don't understand this. Does anybody have any tips or suggestions as to what could be wrong? thanks!

20090220160442AAazkg8	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I lose weight?	Okay, I'm a fourteen year old girl who wants to slim down a little bit for track season. I'm a long distance runner (800m- 1500m) and I exercise a ton, so I really just need to lose weight around my midsection to run faster. I am 5'7" and weigh around 144 pounds, so I probably need to get down to around 135. Here is my current food intake      Breakfast- 1-2 eggs, with an orange    Snack- one apple   Lunch- half a roast beef sandwich with another apple   Snack- another piece of fruit, (bananna, orange, pear, etc.)   Dinner- Whatever we're having, fairly healthy around 800 calories always with a salad (ex. spinach salad with pot roast, small garden salad with pesto and chicken, etc.)      That's about all I eat, for exercise I run around 15 miles a week (7-8 minute miles, 4 miles, four days a week) and play basketball the rest of the days. I also do around 150 situps a day, with plank exercises and stuff. So, how much should I be eating and what should I change?   21 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.

Hi there, I am 22 and I have been aware of my eyes being uneven for quite some time, I have noticed from a picture of when I was 12 my left eye sticks out slightly more giving it a slight droopin effect on my eye lid, until the age of 12 i had to wear glasses.      I recently went to an eye specialist, they measured my eyes and from eyelid to eyelid in height, theres a 1mm difference (10mm - R, 11mm - L) Also they measured how much my eyes come out from the socket that measured (20mm - R, 22mm - L).      They said I am a little bit long sighted but not enough really for glasses and I think a little more in my left eye although I'm not sure which one.  I remember them saying it could be due to this.  My last thyroid check I was in normal range on the borderline of low.      I'm a little confused and I'm wandering if anything can be done to correct this as I am always really paranoid of this and notice it on nearly all of my photos, I often don't like eye contact and speak to people positioning to see the right side of my face.      If it would be more helpful I can send you pictures if somebody requests.      Please Help      Danny

I know I'm putting myself in an unhealthy position, but I really don't know what to do.      To state the obvious, I'm not trying to lose weight. Please no rude answers.

I have intrusive thoughts alot during the day, like i'll be with some rando person, and i'll have a sexual thought about the, then i get all stressed and i cant stop thinking about it. Or all think someones going to die, or i'll picture someone i love like my niece getting hit by a car.      I also will think about something, or someone alot. like its my first thought when i wake up in the morning, and my last thought before i go sleep.   Everyday I have to brush my teeth the same way, and if i mess up ill do it all over again.   sometimes when i see something thats not in place, ill stare at it forever until i get up and fix it.   I count things in a certain order. I'll read a word or paragraph over and over again.   I'll stand at my door wiggling the handle until it feels right after i lock it.   When i go to bed i have to check in my closet, behind the blinds, in my mini fridge in my room and under my bed, even though i know nothings there. And before i turn off the light i look at the edges of the ceiling and i look from corner to corner until it feels right.   when i litsen to my ipod i wait until the time on the song has the number 7 like for example 3:57. it always has to be the last number or ill skip back the song until it does, and i cant watch the light on my ipod go off, and the volume has to be turned exactly halfway.   If i mess up writing something for school i'll have to throw it out and start again, even if im almost done.   Sometimes I'll be sitting there and i'll have to make someone say a word.   theres more but i cant think right now.   If i dont do these thing i feel really anxious, and i get all stressed. and sometimes i have anxiety disorders.   Im 16 btw.

20090220130354AA24yOs	Health;Women's Health	GIRLS!!! Question about periods?	i am a dancer, i dance up to 20 hours a week or more. I just got mono and suddenly stopped dancing to get better. I woke up one day and had started my period. I told my mom and she said ok i will get your stuff but i don't think this will happen often until another year or so... I asked her what that ment and she said your body is use to your metabolism working so fast and one day it came to a sudden stop and your body is like what the crap is going on and its kind of confused so once you go back it won't come back for a while. Is this true??? I think it can be because my metabolism was used to working all the time and one day it just stopped, due to mono. The same thing happened to my mom and she was a dancer just like me and got mono and had one but once she started back at dance didn't have one until the end of ninth or tenth grade. Do think this is true? also is it true that most girls do tend to start around the same time their moms did? Thanks world!!!!

20090220144656AAGCunz	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	A recurring cough in a three year old?	When my daughter was two and a half she came down with bronchitis. Once that had cleared up she had a cough which lasted quite a while. She would wake up at night coughing and it would be so bad that she would throw up from not being able to breathe properly. It went away but then came back every couple of months or so. It's always the same, she starts coughing at night, chokes on phlegm, throws up, usually has a high temperature of 39.5c (whilst on nurofen or panadol).   She was diagnosed by four different doctors with asthma. The inhaler didn't do a single thing and we don't think it's asthma because it isn't constant and she doesn't get out of breath when she does activity. I eventually saw a doctor who said no it isn't asthma. The cough is mostly just at night. She has had chest x-rays and they are all clear. I even had her tested for leukaemia because...well just because. We were thinking maybe croup but the cough isn't a barking cough. She didn't have the cough for about 4 months but now three days ago it has come back again, along with the high temps. (it is hot where we are but she has been getting it from Winter through to Summer - weather doesn't sem to matter) I don't know what to do. The doctors don't seem to have any answers but it is obviously something as it keeps coming back!    Does anyone have any idea what it could be?

There was a problem so the laprocscopic procedure turned into a full on abdominal. She lost alot of blood and became Anemic. Because she was out of work for so long she lost her job but is yet to look for a new one. My mom has (in my opinion) always been lazy. Just lying in bed and if she needs to drive me somewhere thats 5 minutes away complains and makes up excuses. Now she has this. I realise that anemia is fatiguing. but is lying around the house all day nessisary? She actually asked me to break up with my boyfriend because she hates the 40 min drive she needs to make every 2 weeks! Im getting so tired of this i dont know what to do.

20090220125039AApnVze	Health;Women's Health	If you were to design a Barbie, what would she look like? (health)?	I have seen all these topics and stuff about Barbie. If you've never seen Barbie, you really need to get out more often (and look at:  http://www.barbie.com/  )      The opinions are many, her breasts are too big... her neck is too long... if she's so popular, why do you need to buy her friends? Much Barbie-bashing to be had, but here's the real question for all of you.      If you were to design a Barbie doll in the here and now, Mattel came to you to design the next incarnation of the world-famous doll, and you know you would jump at the chance of that! Don't lie and say you would not do it because that's not true. What would she look like? What color hair? What would be her bodily dimensions? Would she be made out of plastic, rubber or some other materials? How long will you make her legs?      Not asking you to design the whole Barbie Universe, just Barbie herself for the new generation.      So... what you got?

I don't masturbate everyday because I want sex with another person. My poor bf feels pressured with sex...but i don't know if that is because of me or because of his insecurities. He has definitely been my best and biggest sex partner, but he doesn't believe me. But I can't tell if I have an excessive sex drive. I never push sex if someone doesn't want it, but if someone else initiates it, I won't turn it down. Am i normal? I'm 21.

A friend of mine has not been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but he's been experiencing auditory hallucinations since he was a child. One time, he tried peyote and it knocked him out. When he woke up, the voices were gone. It stayed that way for about a week and then they came back. Each time he uses it, the voices go away for about a week and return again.      Peyote is supposed to put one in an altered state of perception and feeling, but if someone already has things like hallucinations, could peyote be used to lessen or temporarily void out those hallucinations?

I got home and found that there was a hole above my anus and that there was blood and other liquids draining from it but at a very slow rate. This is why I think I have Pilonidal Cyst.

20090220123400AA2F9KL	Health;Men's Health	Someone's paying me to get circumcised!! Now what?!?!?	I'm 19, 6'1''. Someone is offering me $10,000 to get me circumcised.      But the catch to the deal is that it must be done without anesthetic, and would be done in full view of a male audience. The surgeon is an experienced urologist and have done many circumcisions.      I have never considered circumcising my penis before but this sudden offer is too good to be true. The money is seriously tempting and the surgery fee is being waived off too. Accomodation and food would also be provided free to me too. I don't really mind the male audience too cause I'm from a all boys school and I see lots of naked guys in the locker room for the past years already.      Since I'm still a virgin, I guess it wouldnt affect my sex life much right in the future? I guess the only thing that would affect me is the way I masturbate. I'm clueless abt masturbation of a cut penis. The method looks and seem very different from an uncut one.      So, do you guys think I should go for it? I'm garnering opinions before making a decision. Your opinions would influence my decision to accept/reject the offer      ~Try not to bring in on how it would make my penis look smaller if I get mine cut. I'm quite happy with my 8 inches. Anyway I don't think that getting it cut would shrink my penis that much~

20090220130725AAz9nGA	Health;Women's Health	Miscarriage after FET transfer?	In 2007 I underwent IVF with my husband, transferred 2 fresh embryos and as a result, we had one beautiful baby boy. I'm not sure what happened to the second embryo - I suspect it never implanted. At the time, we were left with 6 embryos to freeze for future use - 2 of which were considered grade 4 -out of a 5 scale - and 4 of which were considered grade 3. We just underwent our first Frozen Embryo Transfer - both the grade 4 embryos were transferred - likely our best "chance" out of all the frozen embryos. Both did remarkably well after their cryopreservation thaw (I'm in utter AWE every time I think about the process they actually went through) - I had a successful implantation - but after 5 1/2 weeks - I had a miscarriage. Besides being devastating - I'm so scared that the other embryos will not work - given that they are all grade 3 levels. Everything I read about miscarriage states that chromosomal abnormalities are the leading cause - likely deficiciencies in the egg or sperm. I'm worried that my eggs retrieved for IVF in 2007 were not optimal - and I'm setting myself up for multiple miscarriages of them all now....Has anyone had sucess with FET's after miscarriage?  Especially with grade 3 embryos?

I popped the acne (or so I think) and only the usual yellow fluid came out. I believe its just acne because every time I eat chocolate i get outbreaks, this acne came about a day after eating a lot of chocolate. However i did come in contact with another girl's mouth last weekend. The fluid that came out was yellow as acne always is, but its the invisible dots under my lip skin that worry me. what are your thoughts?   -Thanks

20090220153743AATbIgN	Health;Mental Health	Is there a term for when one blacks out and becomes violent?	I have witnessed, on several occasions, a person who is normally very level headed and calm will become excessively violent for a short period of time, approx. 15-30 sec, and when the episode is over they will have no memory of what they did. This has only happened 3 or 4 times over a course of roughly 10 years, so they aren't frequent, but the severity and loss of memory is rather strange. Typically it is brought on by extremely stressful situations or if this person was physically hurt. They do not have a violent disposition, nor are they quick to anger which could explain why the episode seems so intense, but there is still the loss of memory during that 15-30 sec period which I think is a little odd.

20090220155632AAry9ZK	Health;Mental Health	Are you on social security disability for a mental illness?	What constitutes being disabled when mentally ill? Is it just a matter of not being able to go to work or is there more to it than that? I personally have schizoaffective disorder and have had a heck of a time keeping gainful employment. I know I'm not Johnny on the spot with hygiene matters either. I shower alot, but as far as laundry and stuff goes I don't care. I can make my own meals and can drive a car a little bit before getting overwhelmed. I like my own company even though I live with roomates/friends. I have a hard time talking sometimes, but I can type really good if I take my time. I've been having hallucinations very frequently lately. I honestly don't want to hop on board the SSA bandwagon just yet, but I'm kind of being driven into a corner. I plan on starting counseling on Monday and I will see my psychiatrist the first week of next month. I hope we can work something out so I don't have to go on SSA. I really want to work. In fact that is all I want to do. What do you think I should do?

20090203062408AAMUxsI	Health;Women's Health	Shes invading my privacy right?	Well I have to share a room with my sister. And we have half the room each. And well here is the problem.   When my mumis on a cleaning spree she will try to clear my room up when I say that I will do it. So she then says well your not doing it at the moment.    So she goes up there and then starts tidying. Looking through my clothes finding things clean and dirty. Like underwear. And of course this is embarassing!   I have a pair of my boyfriends boxers that I wear and I need them washed. But shes going on about colours being separated. And she doesnt no I have them. And I was trying to hdie them from her. But the other day she was like searching through all of my washing clothes and stuff. And she almost found them.    I think that shes invading my privacy by going through all my clothes and washing.    Trying to be helpful yes. But it does get like embarassing.    What should I say about the boxers.. and they are like a greay blue kinda colour so would they be in the coloured wash or the white wash? And do you think Im being unreasonable by telling her not to go through my stuff because its personal?

20090203062240AAPQn0U	Health;Women's Health	Why are my hormones doing this to me?	Ok, I had messed up on my birth control like a month ago.( I had to skip a week) Since then I have had maybe two periods just fine. This week, I was pmsing very bad, crying at everything. I take my patch off on fridays, then I get my period on like tuesday. I didn't get my period until thursday. So I figured I would not put a patch on friday, because that seems unhealthy. So I had to wait until monday, cause I had to call the doc for a refill. So mean while I have had panic attacks, and been crying of spilled milk. Just all of a sudden I will have a feeling of sadness for no reason. What is wrong?

20090203061507AAidqXR	Health;Women's Health	Is it possible to become pregnant and to stay pregnant without the cervix?	My girlfriend has been diagnosed with Erythroplakia on the cervix, and the dr. said it's possible they will have to shorten the cervix... he also said, if she was thinking about having kids, she should do it now... The reason why I'm asking this here, and not her is because she doesn't want to talk about it... she's desperate...       I'm going with her back to the doc next week, but I want to be prepared of what to ask him.      Is it possible for her to get pregnant-obviously not the natural way, and to have a cesarean section?

20090220155726AAwDtnU	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will 1 day of fast food make me fat?	I've been dieting and exercising/cardio everyday since october of 2008 to get my six pack back and to lose a couple pounds. I wasn't fat, but I had a fat face and couldn't see my six pack. I got it back by the way and I finally lost my fat baby face. My senior year I ate 2 double bacon cheeseburgers everyday for lunch and a soda. I know that was unhealthy but I didn't care, it was good.  I cut out soda/juice, fastfood, candy/cakes/cookies/junk. I've been eating more whole wheat/grains, drink water, fruits/veggies, everything thats healthy.  But anyways, a sonic was just built 1 minute from my house and I was kind of hungry driving and like I said I aint had fast food since last year, so I stopped by and ordered a chicken sandwhich w/a small fry. Will this combined with what else I eat today make me gain weight or am I good? And how many calories a day can I eat without putting the weight back on? Im 5'8 and weigh 142 now. In September I weighed 155.
