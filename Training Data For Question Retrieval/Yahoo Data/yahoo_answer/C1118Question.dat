20070424123852AAiGExr	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I attempt to bleach my black hair?	I want to get rid of my black hair and go blonde.  My natural blondish, brown roots are coming in and I'd like to be some what of a platinum blonde.  My hair was dyed black from the cheap box stuff and I haven't dyed it for a while now.  To keep the color vibrate I washed it as little as possible.   I'm starting to scrub my hair and noticed the black is getting a little dull along with the redish highlights I did a while back.   I'm afraid that when I bleach my hair it won't all come out, I don't want it pale blonde but I don't want it yellow or orange either.   Help?   I got a 30 volume bleach kit from manic panic.   I plan on putting some midnight blue in after I get my hair completely blonde.   My hair is only shoulder length but quite thick.   Think it's possible?

20090203131031AAuqZDC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Ditching the school uniform?	I graduated high school almost 3 years ago but my god I hate the uniform. I used to wear sweaters, or a coat or anything to rule break. It was a crappy polo shirt and uncomfortable khakis. I even went to the store and found khakis that at least were comfy AND only ten bucks. Once the principal said 'Those aren't from the uniform store'. I said 'No those pants are horrendous, they tear easily, and cost forty dollars my parents and I don't have. take it up with them' and walked off. He never did. LOL.      Anyway, I only did private school my last two years. Junior year I would change a fair amount but all senior year I would throw a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers in a bag and change in the bathroom across from my last class the minute the bell rang. By the time I walked to my car I was a human being again. This truly helped me feel better about myself. Once my teacher and a classmate asked me as I left the bathroom "Why do you change immediately everyday"? I told them "I have a life outside of this school once the bell rings, and it does not involve staying dressed like that"      Anyone else do something similar?

I would just block that hand, but for some reason, i can't, it doesn't work on them. I've seen a brunette try once on a guy, and he grabbed her hand. But the blondes are too fast. Tell me if you've tried to slap a guy and had him block your hand out? Or we can't? I can't believe this.
20090203131550AAda3Bh	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Help on what to wear. Read Details?	Hi.    On my school, tomorrow is the day you can wear jeans because of the weather. So I don't know what to wear. We don't have a uniform but we do have a dresscode. You can just wear shorts and pants whateve color you want but not jeans. An they let us use polo shirts, so tomorrow we can just wear jeans and the polo rule stays the same. So I have a lot of jeans. But the one I like the best is Levi's it's not a skinny jean. It is kind of boot cut , to the hip. So I was realizing that actually none on my school wear those kind of jeans. And I fin them ugly when I have to use sport shoes. For example nikes and converse. So... My question is, should I go with the Levi's jean or the skinny ones? And if you choose the levi's tell me what type of shoes should I use? Thanks! I will choose best answer.

Finally I got tired of it, and just reccently I dyed it brown. I really like it. But Ive been getting frustrated how the color began to fade. So about a month ago, I dyed it again. But now its growing back to the lighter color. I know it must be doing that because it was blonde for a long time, right? Well I like my hair being dark. So Im REALLYYY wanting to dye it black this time. Will my hair fall out? Will it dry out, even if I do almost anything I can do to keep it healthy? except dying it... Will my hair turn gray?? I have always had thin hair. And Im trying to keep it healthy so maybe it would grow thicker. Also, I thought it was weird how the last two times I dyed it, I didn't feel any burning on my scalp. Could that mean It's drying out? Please, answer these questions. But I would rather not see any dramatic post. :[ hahh... I stress out over little things. Thanks.

The lines I have are deep closer to the nose and I don't like the idea of collagen fillers to "correct" them.  I've got a very expressive smile and was wondering if I could tone it down without losing the ability to smile.  Thanks so much for your time!

20070604200739AA9orSC	Beauty & Style;Hair	Switching shades of blonde...more damaging?	I had brown hair and decided to go to an ashy blonde with some more golden blonde woven through.  Basically it turned into two very heavy weaves and the first time it was toned with an ash toner, the second with a more golden.     I really don't like the color and wanted to just change it drastically to like a more platinum blonde with little pieces of beige.  My hair already feels pretty dried out and I was wondering if this would be a lot more damaging than it would have been to go this shade straight from when my hair was brown.     Is it hard to get the ashy/golden toners out?  Are weaves really hard to reverse?  I'm just frustrated with trying to find a nice shade of blonde.   Thanks so much for any blonding help!

There's this boy in my class who i've liked for what seems forever. Last year me and him were pretty close as friends but this year we aren't as close. I talk to him a little bit from time to time. But he sits on the other side of the class. And he sits behind this really popular girl who I hate but he talks to her all the time. He's really cute and nice. But he liked like 6 different girls this year and i wasn't one of them. I don't want to say anything because th whole class will make fun of me then. How can i find out if he likes me without embarassing myself. I will vote your answer as the best giving you ten points.   SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY

I'm afraid the clip-on ones will hurt, and the magnetic ones might not be very secure. Comfort is probably one of the most important things to me, but it would be a bummer if I lost an earring.

20070628123443AAcN8qI	Beauty & Style;Hair	Question for african-american women?	I am having a constant problem with breakage and intense itching, specifically in the top of my head in the center.  Also, at the back of my head in the center.  This has been going on for the past 9 or 10 years.  The hair in the top center of my head grows back very coarse and feels very dry and brittle.  The texture is completely different than the other new growth that I get.  It also itches very badly once the new growth starts to come out.  After I get a relaxer, it itches for a bit but then it goes away.  But three weeks later, when the new growth starts to come, it automatically snaps off when I comb it.  The dry texture also comes back.  There are fine and weak strands of hair in this area that are all lengths.  Some of the hair is broken off down to the scalp.  It almost looks like somebody took some scissors to my hair.  I don't get it.  I have been going to a really good hairdresser for the past few months.  My hair does feel better overall, but that area is still a problem.

Bras are uncomfortable, like a tight belt around the ribs and heart, making it hard to breath, to think.  Bras are the last of trends that come from the age of the corset.  Corsets made women faint, as it was hard to breath.  Ties for men, are quiet similar, an unnecessary constraint, esp when one has a cold or is asmathic.  Come on people, we are in the new millenium.  Clothes should be comfortable at all times, esp for work.  I myself cannot breath anymore with bras, even the "correctly" fitting ones are too much for me.  I think women should start a new trend, no bras. Whose with me on this?

She doesn't understand that people in there teens and 20's don't wear what seniors wear. Then she gets mad when I don't wear what she buys. I remember when I was a junior in high school she bought me 2 pairs of these big shorts with the elastic in the waist and 2 big plaid shirts from the women's department(not even the misses). When I tried them on she said they fit good. I was a size 9/10 in juniors at the time! She really gets mad when I don't wear the clothes. I don't want to upset her but, those clothes are for old people! what should I do? A 24 year old doesn't want to dress like a 70 year old.

No le crei mucho, ademas de que me parece asqueroso,   Pero por mi cabello, creo q si lo intentaria, alguien pude decirme si esto es cierto?
