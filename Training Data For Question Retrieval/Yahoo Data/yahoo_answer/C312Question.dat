20090307175557AAZIkte	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Isn't mainstream rock bad too?	Like mainstream rap music is bad right now with all the foul rappers coming out, but isn't mainstream rock bad too? Most rock fans my age are fans of old school rock bands from the 60s/70s. So if mainstream rock is good, why aren't they fans of any modern rock groups? Like on youtube, i've been watching videos where rockers rant on why they hate rap, but then when they mention their fav. rock bands, it's never anyone modern (post 2000s). So would you say mainstream rock is bad right now like rap? And what mainstream rock bands in this time are considered crappy?

20090307180946AAtWXy9	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Randy the rooster.......?	This farmer has about 200 hens, but no rooster and he wants chicks. So, he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he has a rooster.       The other farmer says, "Yeah, I've got this great rooster, named Randy; he'll service every chicken you've got. No problem."      Well, Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it. So, he buys Randy.       The farmer takes Randy home and sets him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk...       "Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to service here and you cost me a lot of money and I'll need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun," the farmer said with a chuckle.      Randy seemed to understand, so the farmer points towards the hen house and Randy took off like a shot ~WHAM~ He nails every hen on there THREE or FOUR times and the farmer is just shocked.       Randy runs out of the hen house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake ~WHAM~ He gets all the geese.       Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with the cows. Randy is jumping on every animal the farmer owns.      The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day.       Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the next day to find Randy in the middle of the yard looking like he is dead from exhaustion.       Buzzards are circling overhead. The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal, shakes his head and says, "Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself."       Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and say's, "Shhh. They're getting closer..."

20090307180715AA9eHjg	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	The local Blonde Diary.?	Monday:    It's fun to cook for Tom. Today I made angel food cake. The recipe said beat 12 eggs separately. The neighbors loaned me the extra bowls.       Tuesday:    Tom wanted fruit salad for supper. The recipe said serve without dressing. What a surprise when Tom brought a friend home to dinner and they found me naked!       Wednesday:    A good day for rice. The recipe said wash thoroughly before steaming the rice so I took a bath. Can't say it helped the rice.       Thursday:    Tried a new salad recipe. It said "prepare ingredients; lay on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving." Tom asked why I was rolling around the garden.       Friday:    Found easy recipe for cookies that said "put the ingredients in a bowl and beat it." Something went wrong. When I got home, everything was just as I left it.       Saturday:    Tom went shopping today, brought home a chicken, and asked me to dress it for Sunday. I didn't have any clothes that fit it. For some reason, Tom keeps counting to ten.       Sunday: Tom's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast but all I had was hamburger. Suddenly, I had a flash of genius. I put the hamburger in the oven and set the controls for roast. How disappointing. When it came out, it was still hamburger!       Goodnight, dear diary. Tomorrow I'm gonna buy a bigger oven so I can fix Tom a chocolate moose!

20090307175851AAQBqYS	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Looking for a movie title?	I forget what it is called, but it is a rather old movie. I -think- it is Disney.   The movie is both animated and non.    In the beginning it starts out with a young boy going to bed during a storm. His mother (or father?) comes in but then has to go out because of some big flood and they have to try to stop it.    The I guess in his dream the movie becomes animated. All the characters are animated, but the main one is a rooster (And he is like 'the king'- Elvis kind of guy.)   I do not know if that helps AT ALL but it was a really good movie.    ;[

20090307180539AAq0tBq	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Any soap fans out there?	producer Brian Frons and a couple of other producers are misogynist (not to mention narrow minded). Mr. Frons has made derogatory comments about actresses that don't fit a certain standard of beauty. Some cite his remarks about the actress Kathy Brier's appearance and weight and his constant promotion of Kelly Monaco and others will debate the opposite and that this is all unfounded.       The show is far from it's roots too, it's all violence and very little romance and a daytime show should be somewhat romantic. Don't get me wrong, if you've seen GH than you know that they are pretty good or fun about action scenes and story lines...but I don't think that should overtake the show.      I know you'll say it just a TV show, and a soap at that, but many people campaign for their favorite shows and it has some great story lines and aspects that the producer is just throwing away.      Please consider signing this petition it may not be worded correctly but it is on point       http://www.petitiononline.com/bsfrons/pe...        http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospita...

20090307182314AAHRCbr	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Friendship problem.......................…	Me and another friend made plans to visit London as we live in Manchester. We met this other girl who i got on with instantly and we invited her to come to London with us too.      The thing is, this other girl has invited one of her friends on the trip without our knowledge, and it made us quite angry because we dont really get on well with this girl's friend as she is loud and too nosey about other people's business.      What should i do? Should i confront this girl and tell her not to bring her annoying friend? Or should i be nice and avoid looking like a ***** and stay quiet and agree for her to come with us (i don't think there is anything to agree for - she has invited the girl without asking us first).

Ian Rush      " Germany are a very difficult team to play...they had 11    internationals out there today."    Steve Lomas      "I always used to put my right boot on first, and then obviously my    right sock."

20090307183646AAvKUAN	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	How does the Zodiac work?	Hello.      Leo and Aries are not supposed to get along well, however my parents are that same combination and so are my girlfriend and I. My parents have been married for 21 years and I have never, EVER seen them fight.      I can't tell for sure about me just yet because I haven't been with her for long, but it's working out so far.      My current religious beliefs don't matter, but I've believed in the zodiac since I was little. I guess I started turning away from it (along with the Christian god... loving father my butt) when I started becoming "spiritually aware", but I'd still like to see an explanation from a believer.      PS: Me and my dad are Leos (born the same day, hehe) and my mom and my girlfriend are Aries.

20090307184254AAEirXj	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	If a guy listens to Lil Wayne feat Babyface - "Comfortable", is it suspect?	^ By "suspect" I mean is it borderline homosexual and gay?      Example: if a guy listens to Boyz 2 Men, that is very strange and gay.       The reason it is a tricky situation with "Comfortable" is it is about love and feelings in a sense - which is gay - but it is also very gangsta because lil wayne is tellin the girl in the song that he is so ballin that she should feel blessed to be with him.         Sorry if this offends anyone.       So what do you think. Is it gay for a guy to listen to "Comfortable"?

Both coldplay and the killers produce songs that can be listened to repeatedly. But Nickelback's songs always feel like perishable goods.      then again.. the vocals are annoying.

They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and back together again. The boy asked his father, "What is this, Father?" The father [never having seen an elevator] responded "Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is."      While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched small circles of lights with numbers above the walls light up. They continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction.      The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman stepped out. The father said to his son, "Go get your mother."

Now I don't claim to be a redneck but my family is and I'll admit that for all of my sophistication I fall back on the old redneck bartering/selling system that never fails to catch a few dollars or get you a useful item when you've the need for it. Combined with Craigslist and Ebay this old system can even make you a mint if you know what you are doing.       My Dad specializes in pipe and old lawnmowers, my Mom in carved walking sticks, my Grandpa in scrap metal and old cars, my Grandma antiques, and I'm partial to 55 gallon drums (wood, plastic, and metal).       So what's your favorite item to collect, sell, or trade? :D

If I'm not mistaken, Goku was 1 year old or younger when he was sent to earth and Frieza blew up the planet. So that would make Goku 21 when he fought Frieza on Namek. I also believe that Gohan was about 8 at that time. So that would make Goku 13 when he got Chi-Chi pregnant!!   Guess Saiyans go through puberty a lot earlier than humans lol.

20090307190931AAjhGIy	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Tell me your best joke?	heres mine (its long but hilarious^^):      One day a kid was sitting at home waiting for his relatives to come over. He overheard his parents fighting with each other yelling "YOU B***H" "YOU BASTARD".      Being so young, the kid had never heard those words before and asked his parents what they meant. They replied by saying "B***h means lady and bastard means gentlemen". Satisfied with this answer the boy went to his room.      Then he heard the neighbors having sex. They were repeating the words "D**K and "C**T" over and over and over. Again, the boy was curious and asked his parents what those words meant. Thinking fast, his mother said "D**k means coat and c**t means jackets."      Once again the boy was satisfied with the answer and headed to the bathroom, but his father was shaving and the boy had to wait. Fearing that the boy might wet himself, the father shaved faster. He went a little to quick and ended up cutting himself, "S**T!!!!!" he yelled. "What's s**t mean daddy," the boy asked . The father, stuck for an answer said, "it means shaving cream."      The boy did his "business" and his dad went back to shaving. His next stop was the kitchen, there he saw his mother preparing the turkey. As she reached for a knife she ended up cutting herself. "AW F**K!!", she yelled. "What's f**k mean mommy", the boy asked. "It means stuffing the turkey."      Finally, the guest arrived, the boy went to the door and said, "Hello b***hes and bastards, may I take your d**ks and c**ts? Dad's in the bathroom putting s**t on his face and Mom is in the kitchen f**king the turkey!

20090307193400AAiLnjO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Rock and Pop! Of these 3 songs that I've written, which is your favorito?	1: Flannel Man      Here cometh the flannel man.   Do go run inside.   Here cometh the flannel man.   It'd be best for you to hide.      His eyes are flannel.   His face is too.   You'd better escape,   Before he eats you.   Here cometh the flannel man.   Do go run inside.      Here cometh the flannel man.   Hide that shirt right now!   For you know, he will get you,   If you're dressed in flannel, somehow!      By day he is tartan.   By night, he is plaid.   He preys upon those who are flannel clad.   Here cometh the flannel man.   Do go run inside.      Here cometh the flannel man.   Beware you, grunge pioneers!   You'd be wise to switch to cotton,   To remedy your fears.      He'll come through your window.   He'll come through your door.   Better not wear that fabric anymore.   Here cometh the flannel man.   Do go run inside.            #2: Loonies In The Corn      There be loonies in that corn!   They hide between the rows!   There be loonies in that there corn!   They scare away the crows!      They speak in gibberish and twitch alot!   They're afraid of clouds!   But, they can never ever be caught!   Because of their secret shrouds!      The loonies hop up and down!   They chase their own hands!   They're always smiling, never a frown!   They know no other lands!      There be crazies in the ears!   Sometimes, they think they're dogs!   They get anxious as daybreak nears!   They think they'll turn into logs!      There be loonies in the corn!   They live in corn husk huts!   There be loonies in that there corn!   Everyone knows they're nuts!            #3: I Like Head Butting Famous People Part 1      The mighty Bruce Dickinson is a special man.   And what ever he can't do, his spikey wristband can.   I head butted him at Applebees. I rammed him with my skull.   I told him to eat his burger but, he said he was full.      And now for Gene Simmons. He has helmet hair.   He looks very, very old but his girlfriend doesn't care.   I head butted him at Walmart. It was lots of fun.   He chased me in his very tall boots and I began to run.      Then there is James Hetfield. He's a crazy dude.   And his crazy crazy face puts me in a crazy mood.   I head butted him at Target or as he would say, "Tarj-ay".   He told me to leave him alone but, I rammed anyway.      There is also Angus Young. He is 3 feet tall.   And he was quite surprised, when I ambushed him at the mall.   I head butted him in Macy's. He almost fell over.   I thought he was leprechaun so, I asked for a 4 leafed clover.      And now for Eddie Vedder. He pops out of ceilings.   The sight of his billowy hair gives me crazy feelings.   I head butted him in Dillards. I had an enjoyable time.   I thought that he would run but, up the wall, he began to climb      And lastly, for Les Claypool. He plays some crazy bass.   He told me that his name was Mud, when I rammed him in the face.   I head butted him at Denny's, while he was having toast.   He is the famous guy, I like head butting the most.         Which one do you like best? #1 is based on a man that broke into my house, who was completely made of flannel and asked me if I knew where Eddie Vedder was. I wrote this song and sent it via telegram to Eddie Vedder, to warn him that was going to be eaten, unless he hid all his flannel. I wrote #2 after the 5 years I was a member of a tribe of corn worshippers, after I escaped the asylum. #3 is based on my experiences with famous musicians. I really did head butt them.

He said to the doctor, "I think my wife is deaf because she never hears me the first time and always asks me to repeat things."      "Well," the doctor replied, "go home tonight, stand about 15 feet from her, and say something. If she doesn't reply, move 5 feet closer and say it again. Keep doing this until we get an idea about the severity of her deafness."      The husband went home and did exactly as the doctor had instructed. He started off 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she was chopping some vegetables.      He said, "Honey, what's for dinner?"      He heard no response. He moved 5 feet closer and asked again. No reply. He moved 5 feet closer. Still no reply.      He finally got fed up and moved right behind her, about an inch away, and asked again, "Honey, what's for dinner?"      She replied, "For the fourth time, vegetable stew!"

I think we had it on a 45 record.      A song about a little girl, her parents fighting and she hides...maybe under a car or something.  It was sung by a female and in 1st person (so the woman singing had experienced this herself, as the little girl)      Any help is appreciated...

20090307194510AAiuoGh	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Top 10 most overrated rappers of all time?	To make everything clear here, I'm not listing who's the worst, just who people like to overrate the most.      1.Tupac   So many overrate this guy, had two great albums, two average, and one garbage. People act like he's god, like there is nobody coming close to him, as if he's a prophet or something. Was a good rapper, not taking that from him, just wasn't the best. R.I.P   2.Lil Wayne   So called "best rapper alive", has no flow, no lyrics, terrible punchlines,   and who says things like "I'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur"? 80% of every school is on his d*ck. Never put out a good album.   3.Biggie   Had one good album and one was just average, west commercial on his second album, wasn't all that lyrical as people try to say. Was a good rapper though R.I.P    4.Eminem   Great lyricist no doubt, ok flow, but he doesn't take his work seriously sometimes, has many bad songs on his catalog, for example Puke and Fack. Without Me was one of the most immature songs I've ever heard. Fell off big time after he started f*cking with 50.   5.Jay-Z   Only like two albums from him, Reasonable Doubt and Blue Print, it's ok to borrow lines, but Jay-Z does it way too much, he's like a neighbor you see on TV, always knocking on the persons door and asking for sugar or something. His last year and a half was just terrible, making songs on the wrong subjects, and with the wrong rappers. He also doesn't take enough time on his albums.   6.Dr.Dre   Great producer, but how is he so called legend? The Chronic is ranked as one of the best albums of all time, how? It had average lyrics with ok production. Most of his work was written by somebody else. Should just stick to producing if you ask me.   7.Eazy-E   Also so called legend..., just like Dr.Dre he had ghost writers and no great albums.   8.50 Cent   Just garbage, no good albums, bad lyrics, and people still d*ck ride him. Just gave himself an image of gangster and people hopped right on him.   9.Lupe Fiasco   Now I listen to this guy, but his fans try to say that he's the second coming of Nas. Food & Liquor was suppose to be better than Illmatic. Has two albums and people already trying to call him best ever. The Cool was also just an average album.   10.Ludacris   People try to call him "underrated", nobody who won a grammy is underrated, went platinum, and has many fans, how is he underrated? People also try to call this guy most lyrical, yeah right, I would love to see this guy stand next someone like GZA. Also has too many songs about sex.      Here's a list of these guys from best to worst, just so people don't get it confused, I'm not listing these guys who's the worst.   1.Biggie   2.Lupe Fiasco   3.Tupac   4.Jay-Z   5.Eminem   6.Ludacris   7.Dr.Dre   8.Eazy-E   9.50 Cent   10.Lil Wayne

20090307191755AAiRCHl	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	I Need some help with piano sheet music PLEASE HELP?	PLEASE READ AND HELP ME I NEED TO KNOW THIS      Okay I have this small picture bellow of a segment of sheet music.  What are those little tiny notes appearing on there that I circled?  Are they 1/16th notes or something do you just play them fast then?  Second There is one part of the sheet music thing there where it shows that you hold down B but then you are supposed to hit B again if it is a 1/16th note so....how can you hit a note if you are supposed to be holding it?    My LAST question is people have told me that accidentals i.e. sharps flats and naturals appearing in a measure change all the notes that are the same i.e. if there is a D sharp appearing in the middle of a measure all the D's later on would be sharp in the measure from the middle right?  Okay if that is true the part that I don't understand is would lower or higher E'S also be flat in that measure?  For instance say there is a sharp sign on the very bottom line of the treble clef well this is E obviously but would you play E'S sharp that are higher or lower in pitch than just the bottom lined one on the G clef?          http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k96/de...

I prefer it to be a sad love songs because it would make the song a lot deeper and I think mellows works best when it has those kind of lyrics.

20090307201132AA0uK1x	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Twilight Rave - Edward & More?	Yes it is reposted if any one read it :)  ( I wanted a better suited category) Sorry :)      Seriously? What is this uproar about Robert? He is so disgusting .. is this the new way of the world? Be called hot because you play a guy who's supposed to look hot? Come on people get a life. I know some of you have got to agree with me, he is a level of gross that is so -- UGH. He was actually hot as Cedric Diggory now he's so gross. Personally Edward Cullen should not have been anything like Robert. Also I have a problem with the fact that he says all modern things in it like how he called Bella "Spider Monkey" would a man back in the 1800's or whenever say this? He's supposed to be OLD FASHIONED. I don't get that at all? Also Kristen Stewart was OKAY for Bella not overly great-- For her maybe we all just had too high expectations so whatever -- I'll get over it since I do like her acting skills. (but maybe a little Emily browning'd make my day too! :( ) I realize we all have different opinions but come on who out there would actually pick him before we knew it was him. Also this whole TWILIGHT so popular thing? Yes it was a great book but aren't books better to read for yourself? What I hate is all the "populars" reading it to be cool! Come on you people have you ever picked up a book before? Who are you to say it's "amazing" Stephanie is an OKAY author but there's better -- way better. I'm not saying I didn't melt when I picked up twilight, and rush to the store to pick up my 6 month- pre-ordered copy of breaking dawn, and that I didn't glue my eyes to the page and never stop reading. All I'm saying is there's other books out there. :) Agree or don't who cares? ALSO JACOB WAS SUCH AN *** HOLE through the books, and Taylor Lautner is so cute! I loved him but as Jacob. EW. He was so annoying Jacob fans suck. All he was, was a problem Plus I've always been on the vampires side in VampsVSLycans (and for you morons LYCANS = Lycanthropes, the real name for your precious ******* werewolves) K, i'm done :) Love to hear your comments.

20090307211846AAqlEdL	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Hey is this joke funny?	For those of you in the Chicago land area, I got this off of Svengoolie.   A guy is applying for a job, and he looks in the newspaper. He finds one, and the qualities are: you have to know how to work a computer, you have to know how to type, and you have to be bilingual (speak a different language or languages). So he goes  to the place to apply for the job, and when he gets there he sees a cat who is also appyling. The guy says to the manager," you can't hire a cat, they don't know how to work a computer." so the cat jumps up to a computer and opens up a program does a whole stuff with it and jumps down. The guy says," OH, well you still can't hire a cat, they don't know how to type." so the cat jumps right back up to the computer, opens Microsoft Word      and types a sentence and jumps back down. the guys says"Oh, well you still can't hire a cat, they aren't bilingual." so the cats says "WOOF!"   Rate it from 1-10. Thanks ; )

Probably even before, I'm 14 now and I listen to him more than my parents do. However, I can't really find any of the old songs I loved on YouTube or anything.   i.i. Desperation Samba (Halloween in Tijuana), Off to See the Lizard, Delaney Talks to Statues, etc.   I loved them so much, more a fan of his 'beachy' music rather than his country stuff. Anyways, I was wondering if there are any real Parrot Heads still around?   Also, if you know where I can listen to some of the songs I mentioned and more, please tell me      ~Marissa :)

20090307175030AAWlLqX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How can "sensuality" be at an R-rated level?	I just found out that movie (which I have not seen yet) has been rated R.   Then I went to  http://filmratings.com  and I found out that one of the reasons for it's rating is SESUALITY.      How in the world can "pleasing to the senses" (which is the literal definition of sensuality) be at an R level?      How is it possible for an amount of pleasingness to be too strong for kids younger than 17?      Nudity and Sensuality are NOT the same thing. If this movie has nudity and that's supposed to be the sensual content, then why the f___ didn't the MPAA just put "nudity" in the rating like they've done for hundreds of other R-rated movies.   "Sensuality" does NOT refer to the material that's causing the pleasingness. It refers to the pleasingness itself. And apparently that pleasingness is too intense for kids under 17?         Yours truly,

20090307181123AAc4WQQ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Does anybody find this weird or is it just me?	Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.    John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.       Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.    John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.       Both were particularly concerned with civil righ ts.    Both wives lost their children while living in the White House.       Both Presidents were shot on a Friday .    Both Presidents were shot in the head       Now it gets really weird.       Lincoln 's secretary was named Kennedy.    Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln       Both were assassinated by Southerners.    Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.       Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln , was born in 1808.    Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.       John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln , was born in 1839.    Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.       Both assassins were known by their three names.    Both names are composed of fifteen letters.       Now hang on to your seat.       Lincoln was shot at the theater named 'Ford.'    Kennedy was shot in a car called ' Lincoln ' made by 'Ford.'       Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran and hid in a warehouse.    Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran and hid in a theater.       Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.       And here's the kicker...       A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe , Maryland    A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.

20090307171809AAEgJ01	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: Boss likes me? what should I do?	well, I just got a new job and my boss seems really nice   apparently he gets mad easily but when I screw up or do something stupid he doesn't yell at me. Well the other day his little sister (shes 13) told me that she thinks he likes me.   its against company policy to date.   so I kissed him and he pulled away saying "its not appropriate to date coworkers."   I then asked him if he liked me or not, and he refused to answer.      so the problem is do you think he does like me? I confronted his sister about it today when I saw her and she just said that he is really strict about the rules at work and would never date a worker but she still said she thinks he likes me.      so what am I supposed to do? I cant quit. :(      do you think she is just lying?
