20080523170058AAdSqzr	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Como se comen las frutas? LEER TODA LA PREGUNTA ANTES DE RESPONDER! GRACIAS!?	La fruta es el alimento perfecto, requiere una mínima cantidad de energía para ser digerida y le da lo máximo a su cuerpo de retorno.    Es el único alimento que hace trabajar a su cerebro.   La fruta, es principalmente fructosa (que puede ser transformada con facilidad en glucosa). En la mayoría de las veces es 90-95% agua. Eso significa que está limpiando y alimentando al mismo tiempo.   El único problema con las frutas, es que la mayoría de las personas no saben como comerlas, de forma de permitir que su cuerpo asimile efectivamente sus nutrientes.   Se deben comer las frutas siempre con el estómago vacío. ?Por qué? La razón es que las frutas en principio, no son digeridas en el estómago, son digeridas en el intestino delgado.   Las frutas pasan rápidamente por el estómago, de ahí pasan al intestino, donde liberan sus azúcares.

20090225071944AAHWOqX	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Anyone have a good, yet easy recipe using white rice?	I usually buy Rice-a-Roni, or Mahatma rice because I loved flavored rice dishes, but hate plain white rice.  I need at least gravy on it.  My husband decided to be "helpful" and do some of the grocery shopping, and came home with a 20 lbs bag of white rice so that I wouldn't have to keep buying the boxes of rice that I usually purchase.  Is there something I can throw in the pan that will make it flavored rice instead of just plain rice?  I'm looking for something simple like, shake cinnamon and turmeric on it and you will have a fabulous dish that is as simple as Rice-a-Roni, not a complicated meal that will take me two hours to make.

After drinking well water all my life, city water is like drinking out of a swimming pool. I've tried boiling it and that doesn't help. Do water filters like Brita, PUR, etc help at all or are they a waste of money? Is there anything else I can try short of buying bottled water?

I'm going on a trip to France and several of the days we are getting "boxed breakfast" from the hotel, and I don't know what to expect. Some people have said it's small and unsatisfying, but I'm not sure if I should bring any extra food. If so, what will the airlines allow on or what would be a good idea?      Any other travel tips are welcome
