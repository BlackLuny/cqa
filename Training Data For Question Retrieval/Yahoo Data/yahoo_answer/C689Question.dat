20081119182537AApFxeK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where do I take this girl out for a (non)date i.e. she agreed to dinner but did not want anything too fancy?	So I've had this crush on this girl for almost a month now and due to a crazy coincidence we ended up at the same party. After talking to her some more I mustered up the courage if she "wanted to hang out sometime." She agreed and said that wednesday/thursday would be alright.      So I call her wednesday night, the call goes to voicemail after a couple of rings and I leave a message asking her if she wants to still go out. She calls me back today (Wed) saying that she will be busy tonight but would still like to go out for dinner, tomorrow, Thursday night. However, I wanted to kind of push the point of making it a date, so I asked her "would you be averse to go somewhere fancy?" With the way the conversation was going awkwardly I wasn't surprised that she turned down the idea.      So now this leaves me in a bit of a bind. What kind of place would I go to that would have dinner, would be cute/fancy, not to excessive, but not generic. I suppose this is a catch-22 kind of thing, where if the dinner goes well for her, she can consider it a date but if it goes badly we can both dismiss it as a hangout.       If it helps and if anyone local is going to answer this question, I am around the Irvine/OC area.

20081123005814AAamIsa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys..please, please help me?	I met a guy a month ago and we had no mutual friends..I got a bit fed up with how much I inhibit myself, so I was like, why not. It was supposed to be just a one night stand...then I ended up seeing him two more times, and I ended up developing an emotional connection with him. I've had boyfriends before, but I had never slept with any of them.       He can go for days without contacting me. Sometimes when we're together, he makes it clear that he doesn't care about me. Yet, every 1 in a million times he'll show me a softer side.      I don't know...I have it bad.   Am I in for a disaster?
20081123011226AAbWv6b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would make a girl say " I don't get you" ?	First of its been a while since I had a good relationship, I've had a few dates here and there but nothing worthy. I don't get a good read off her sumtimes I can tell shes into me and sumtimes shes not especially when we are with friends. Plus shes like the biggest flirt I've seen. But when she's with me she acts all different, wtf is going on??? I really do like this girl, but all the mixed emotions are way to confusing for me to decipher.
20081217012117AAIxc5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I lost my virginity to a one night stand?   What do you honestly think about all this?	About a month ago I made a HUGE mistake.      I got out of a long term relationship and I was heartbroken and confused. A week after the breakup I met this guy, Jason. 2 days after we met we hung out and went to his friends party. He was super sweet to me. I ended up drinking a bit at the party but the alcohol hit me harder than usual because i didn't realize i was drinking on an empty stomach. That night I ended up sleeping at his place and lost my virginity that i've been saving for THE one for 19 years. He didn't even know i was a virgin until he had trouble fitting it in. When I told him he stopped said "WOW, I NEVER knew that" and stopped and layed on my chest. He then a few minutes later said "that's so hot" and continued. After he found out i was a virgin he seemed VERY uncomfortable and not as sure as himself as before. When his thing would slip out he'd like try putting it back in but wouldn't even be close to the whole. He'd then have this like nervous laugh. He then stopped because he was "tired" and then took me in his arms intervined our legs and held onto me and cuddled. He then even seemed very uncomfortable after he got up being naked and all and having an erection.      After we had sex we watched movies until 5 in the morning cuddling with blankets. He was still super sweet. When we went to bed he also was still super sweet and very thoughtful asking me if i was cold, wanted another pillow etc.      The next morning he was even sweeter and took me out for breakfast. We then watched some more movies cuddled. He just seemed to want to impress me. Like just say id be like "i want to be a teacher, because i love kids" he'd be like "i love kids to, id be a good dad, i want 2 kids, im so good with kids".      When my mom picked me up the next day he even wanted to meet her and seemed nervous. He even asked for my my home # and called me 2 days later. We talked for like an hour but I said alot of things i regret. I told him my mom knew we slept together and she cried a bit and i almost did to. I also told him that i think 6 months is to early for sex and that i was always scared of loosing my virginity because i didnt want to be disrespected or used. I also told him that it was TOTALLY out of my character to do what i did with him. I also told him that "i cant believe i did something so stupid, well not stupid because that sounds harsh but like not myself"      He never called me back and when i seen him at our College i said "heyy" and he said "wussuppp" and i gave him a dirty look and looked away. The next time i saw him he just looked down and kept his head down and acted like he didnt see me and headed to his bus. Then when his back was to me i saw him from the corner of my eye peek over his shoulder and look at me.      What do you think of this?   Thanks!
20081127130139AAhrV9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Seriously, is it true that women can go their whole lives without sex?	I am just so perplexed by this idea. I mean, as a guy, sex is obviously like the only thing guy's think about. Is this really not the same for women? This whole thing sounds stupid, but aren't there any women who just want to have sex if given the opportunity? Don't women want to be satisfied? Or can you guys seriously just go really long periods of time with little to no sexual desire whatsoever? Yes... my hormones are raging, fair enough, but more than anything, I really just do find this fascinating.
20081129102748AAk0gL2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it a bad present after all for boyfriend? ?	So five days ago i gave my boyfriend a birthday present. I asked on here before i gave it to him, if i should, because it was kinda creative, but all the guys on here said that they would love to have gotten it for their birthday. So i went ahead and gave it to him right before I left and he hasn't called! I am extremely pissed. No call or thank-you. Am i over reacting? I don't think so. What should i do..i don't feel like i should be the one to call him.      The present was like 6 different homemade gift cards, or coupons i made. Like a free dinner, free back massage, free birthday wish, free personal slave for a night..etc...

20081209110221AAmBwLn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get my wife to listen to me?	I've been with my partner for 8 years and I feel like our relationship is falling apart. Especially our sex life. There are many things that are contributing factors to this I think. First, I feel like she's always putting me down and doesn't see the good things I do and she works so much that we don't often have a chance to spend quality time together. The quality time is needed for me because I need to be romanced a little to feel up to sex! I don't know how to approach her about this because she takes offense very easily and I just need advice on how to talk to her and get her to listen to me without getting defensive about how I feel. Advice anyone?   
20081209124046AABrYhN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me figure out this girl?	I have become good friends with this girl that i have known for 2 months. She tells me everything from her family, whats going on and her friends who she hates. I have always liked this girl from the first time I saw her and I don't know if she is showing that she wants to be friends or more.      Once in class she looked at me and smiled that was the first time she had done that so I smiled back at her. Another time while we were doing a test she sat next to me and we kept laughing at little things together. At that time i looked at her closely and shes like "what"? and i simply said "nothing"      Today I asked if she wanted to get some coffee and this is how it went: I asked over msn      She will never start off conversations in person or on msn I always have to say something first. She laughs around me a lot and sometimes she tries to catch up to me when I am walking a head of her.      Me: if u have time u wanna get some coffee tomorrow?   her: ya mayb or after exams   i wanna do good lol   Me: alright after exams then! these ones are gona be hard.   After that point i steered the convo towards the exams we have because i thought she didnt seem interested.. What do you guys think from everything here does she want to be friends or want to go out?

I have an extrmely high sex drive. alot higher than my man! and I always feel like I am pestering him for sex all the time. I have to have sex at least once a day (which I dont think is rediculous). The thing is though, sometimes I pester him for sex and he does not seem interested but then I can here he is pleasuring himself in the shower or in the bedroom when I am in another room! I have asked him if he does not find me attractive anymore (and he says he does and we do have sex so not like he does not want to touch me)      Would men rather masturbate than have sex as thats what it seems!?

For 3 years I had a guy I didn't know find out my name, call it out in the hallways, smile to me, talk about me with his friends, go to all my games. I was always nice to him. I was even flattered and in lust.      Then it stopped. He quit looking at me the same. Got a girlfriend, she's really intelligent. But when they're not together in the halls I still see him looking at me like he once had. The spark is there, everything. But when they are he never even looks at me. What's going on?

20090114202718AAYGkg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So he flirts with me, then he ignores me? whats going on?	Ok so over the winter break at school this senior from my math class messaged me over myspace. He is a really sweet guy but i am not into him in ANY way. So we started talking just friendly but then he started to flirt alot! like he told me he liked my style, and that he thought i was really pretty. He also told me that he would sometime check me out in math class (which kind freaked me out). It was nice to hear since i am not complimented by guys very often but he went a little to far saying that he liked my "twins" and i told him that saying that made me uncomfortable. So he stopped. Then he started infering that he wanted to hang out and go out on a date, and that is when i told him straight up "i hope you are not expecting more out of this than i am willing to give, you are such a nice guy but i dont see you as more than just a friend" and he agreed. He said just friends and seemed cool with it.   BUT   now he doesnt really talk to me. He wont return my messages, he wont return my phone calls, or texts. I really wanna be friends with him. But did i make him mad by telling him that. i thought we were on the same page.   Whats going on???

About 30 minutes into the movie, I began to try getting closer to her, and she put her head on my shoulder. Eventually, I put my arm around her and we sat like that for the next 2 hours. I was ecstatic, seeing as I had never been on a real date before, and that was the closest thing I've ever had.   Today at school, however, we made no reference to last night, and she acted completely normal. I'm not sure if she likes me as more than a friend, how can I find out for sure? What should I do next, how can I make sure not to screw this up for myself?    I really like her and I hope she likes me too...

I've started making friends recently and opening up a little more, but one thing I'm really not sure on is how often is normal to be talking/texting someone your friends with or want to be closer friends with?  People dont initiate conversations all that often with me but when I start it I feel like we have good talks.  Also, alot of the time I'll want to talk but have no idea what to say (and I hate using stupid small talk things like the weather).  and how do you develop reall yclose friendships?  just hang out alot and let it develop naturally?

20090309181925AAExO2z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How did my ex-husband managed to get the whole stimulus check without my permission?	Ok, this is what happened. All 2007 I was married to my husband, but 4 months we were together and the remaining 8 months we were separated . So by the end of 2007 we were still married but separated. In all 2007 I only worked for one month on December and made only 600 dlls so I didn't have to do my taxes, since I didn't owe to the government (Actually the government was supposed to give me a little but I didn't ask for it)   I am fairly new to this country so I had no idea their was a stimulus payment going on.   My ex did his taxes for 2007 as if married to me (because we were married even though we were separated so it is ok) but I am not sure how he got the stimulus check that belonged to me and his (600 dlls for him and 600 dlls for me) unless he filled "married jointly" but we didn't do it together. He needed to file "married separate" didn't he? Was people able to get the whole stimulus check that corresponds to their partners even though they didn't file together? Did he had to file "married separate" or did he signed for me without me knowing, or using my social security without my knowledge?   If so would that be fraud?   This year I realized this because if you did get the money for 2007 then you cannot ask anything for 2008, so I asked him if he had gotten all the money for 2007 ($1200) and he said yes.

And then she spread a rumor like that around my school, which made me mad, so now I hate her.      But now, I'm letting those negative things take over my brain and feel like crying more often then normal. My mind is also telling me that my friends are more pretty/handsome than I am and that no one talks to me very often because they hate me....I can't control it, but need suggestions that might help me do so.           Has anyone felt like this before?         I know I'm stronger than her...I just don't always feel that way...

20090309182054AAQsrxe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Alright....so..........?	so this guy and me have been together for a month and he made a big impact on me since he was my first. it took me a while to get over the feeling. but sometimes it comes back. (and when we 'ended it' we chose to be amazing friends)   how do i know if i still have feelings for him?    whenever he logs on chat my stomach flips and my hear beats fast.   but when i talk to him in person its like I'm talking to my best friend and i don't feel anything. im soooo confused!   has this happened to you before? thanks for all the advice
20090309183915AAxrdJh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to read this girl...?	I'm afraid I'm over thinking the things that she's doing... for some reason, I guess I can't accept the fact that she might just be a shy girl toward guys like me she doesn't know in the hopes that she might have a thing for me. I've liked her almost since the beginning of the school year, we sit right next to each other in history class... Here are some things I've noticed, all MIXED:      -When another friend and I used to talk, she tried to enter our conversations, but we always sort of shrugged her off because she's really quiet and we didn't know if she had actually said anything   -She spends a lot of attention on me when my friend and I talk (could be that she's just interested in the convo, though); she'll consistently do it though   -She'll text a lot during the lecture   -Every time I walk up the row, she'll be staring at me like if I'm walking back to my seat after throwing something away   -However, a few times, she's even glared at me for some reason :x (trust me, we sit next to each other, she doesn't have eye issues)   -Whenever I actually turn my head in her direction to look at the teacher, she isn't looking at me and gets sort of squirmy (I guess I Would too, if a girl I Didn't know started doing that)            So...any insight? Am I probably just over thinking everything and mistaking her for just an ordinary human being? the glaring thing that's going on is throwing me off a bit and making me discouraged; would she glare at me if she truly liked me? i doubt it ...   We've spoken before, but it was only polite talk and school-related...

She emotionally abuses me and treats me like I'm 4 years old. I'm 17 for God's sake. She thinks I'm too young to have a bf. When she found out about my current bf, she said I can never talk to him or see him and I have to break up with him. It's ridiculous!!  My dad said I can move in with him but only after he pays off the rent he owes which won't be for months. My friend said I can move in with her and her parents said it was okay. But I know for a fact my mom would never allow that. She keeps saying she needs me to stay cause she needs the child support.  I'm very depressed and kinda something else (can't say personal issue) cause of my mom. She refuses to let me see a therapist. I CAN'T STAND HER ANYMORE!! Is there a PA law that says I can move in with my friend just until I can move in with my dad? PLEASE HELP!

20090309184004AAu6nAw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When does our responsibility as parents end?	My ex and his wife recently found out our son (who is 11) is 10 assignments behind in school.  2 weeks ago they knew he was 7 assignments behind, and did nothing.  My ex's excuse was our 11 year old 'knows better'.  While I agree that an 11 should know better than to pull this, his father and step mother knew about it 2 weeks ago, and never let me know or did anything about it.  While an 11 yr old might "know better", at what point do you stop parenting because the kid should know better???  I feel my ex and his wife are very wrapped up currently because she is expecting, and the 3 kids they currently have are being ignored.      I feel they are being very selfish, and putting more responsibility on the kids they currently have because they don't want to take the time involved in actually parenting.  You don't have to agree with me, but know the bullshit replies will be ignored.  Any suggestions in dealing with this would be very appreciated.      BTW:  I only found out she is expecting last week.  I am happy for them, but this is just one more step in the never letting me know about anything in their lives.  Although I get my son half the week every week, and tell them everything, it's pulling teeth to get any info from them.

20090309181739AAgA43B	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Random Phone Call After a Year!!?	Hi all      I have been broke up with my ex girl friend now for over a year. These days I would spend very little time thinking about her, once in a while it would cross my mind but in general I’m over it and have moved on..      A few nights ago I was in bed asleep when I got a phone call at around 3:30am from a withheld number. I didn’t answer it and let it ring out at first but when it rang for the second time curiosity got the best of me so I answered. It was my ex girlfriend! She was out on the town and by the sounds of it had a few too many drinks.      I thought about just hanging up on her, switching my phone off and forgetting about it but I was curies as to why she had called so I didn’t. She started of with small talk but eventually she started poring her heart out and telling me she missed me and how she didn’t know what she had until she lost it she then went on to tell me how she has compared every other man she has been with to me and non of them have come clos! She said she does not think she will ever find anyone like me and asked if I think I would find anyone like her again to which I responded “I hope not, I don’t think one person can have that much bad luck” (I know it’s a bit sharp but it was 3:30am and I didn’t feel like beating round the bush with her)      I always had a feeling she regretted breaking up with me but hearing her actually say it was a bit of a shock to be honest. I felt like this is just karma at work and what went round came back round and that her thoughts that the grass would be greener after breaking up with me where shattered by the reality that she just messed up a relationship that could have made her happy..      I am a bit confused as to why after so long she still feels like this because I know I don’t, I have moved on and my life is going pretty well at the minute. I haven’t thought about her in quite a while and don’t really get how she still has these seemingly strong feelings after such a long peride of time..      Anyone any thoughts on this one??

20090309182316AAIh7qn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	Okay so I really like this guy and I'm always reading things on 'how to tell if a guy likes you', and I've come to the conclusion that he likes me, but I have doubts. Plus, today at school my friend when up to him and said "(my name) likes texting you" and then there was an awkward silence for 2 seconds and then she said "Catch my drift?" and then she tells me that he smiled and nodded his head. THEN she tells me that at the end of the 5-minute conversation he mentioned how he was 'kind of seeing someone else', but my friend said she didn't know what that was about. Is he? I don't think he is, but I don't know anything. I've never had a boyfriend before (I'm 13.)      Also, after this today he sat next to me in the class I have with him and we talked the whole time as we nearly always do.      So here are reasons why I think he likes me:      ?He's in one of my classes and about half way through this school year he starts asking me if he could sit at the computer next to the one I was sitting at. Of course I say yes, and we chat for ever and ever. He holds eye contact ALL THE TIME, and he leans in and on my chair a lot when he talks to me. He listens to what I'm saying and seems interested. He responds to what I say, and he tells me stuff about himself, too. We laugh LOTS.      Last week we had to go through these things together for this class we have, and when we both were flipping a page I brushed against his hand and said "You hands feel weird" and he was like "Really?" and I didn't grab his hands because I was hesitant, but he grabbed mine and we started feeling each other's hands and crud, lol.      Then soon after I told him about how last summer this girl from up north came down to Florida and swam on my swim team for a few months, and how one day in the middle of practice she says, "OMG whoah! You're face is so soft," and how she kind of stroked it and stuff. When I was telling him this I was like asking why she would do that and then he asks "Do you mind?", and then starts touching my face. Then we laughed.      ?In the morning, I'm in this group that always hangs out at this one table in the cafeteria before the bell rings. Oftenly he comes and talks to me, and yes he comes alone. One time I was the only one there and he came and talked to me fore 45 minutes straight. We talked about his life and my life and a whole bunch of stuff.      ?He randomly pops out of nowhere. A few weeks ago when I was getting off the bus in the morning and wakling to the cafeteria, (I was watching him out of the corner of his eye) he was talking to his friends (he rides a different bus than me). Then he spots me, stops walking and lets his friends go ahead, then walks up to me and is like "Boo!" and then we start talking. He also makes other random appearances.      ?After school last week on Friday eighth graders are allowed to hang out in our courtyard for 20 minutes before school ends. So we were out there and I got to talking to him. He's an actor and all and loves theatre and he oftenly randomly starts singing some sort of Broadway song to me. Well on that day, he starts singing this song to me and dancing around me in circles. Then we talked some more.      ?My whole life I wore my hair up in a ponytail, but starting middle school I wore it down sometimes or in a bun. One day in class he told me how he thought it looked better up than down. I texted him later that day and he said that it was because "it looked more sporty", and that he just liked ponytails.      ?In geometry class (he has our geometry teacher 1st hour and I have her 2nd hour) we were talking about the Golden Ratio, which is some ratio that you can use to see it's similiarty to your body. It's said that the perfect person has the ratio, and they always tend to be really pretty. Apparantly my teacher repeatedly mentioned to her 1st hour that she thought I would have that ratio. This guy I like also mentions this to me a lot.      ?When I openly insult myself such as saying how I'm ugly or something like that, he kind of quietly mutters "Nawwww" but not too obviously. Is this because he doesn't want to seem apparant? Or is he just saying that softly because he believes it's true but just wants to be polite?      _______________________________      But I have my doubts...      If a guy likes you he isn't going to rush to your side every time he sees you, right? He'll come to you often but won't all the freaking time, right? I'm guessing this is because he doesn't want to look or seem like an idiot, but I dunno.      I'm also not sure because he could be the type of guy that just is nice to everyone, but he DOES act differently around me than other people. But still... he hangs out with lots of other girls and walks with them and eats lunch with them here and there, but he doesn't do the stuff he does to me to them.      SO. Does he like me?? Or is he just a good friend? I was totally thrown off when my friend told me that he said that he was "kind of seeing someone else". I don't

20090309183715AA4aBws	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is it that guys do this?	I'm a freshman in high school, and I had this friend that is an upperclassmen. Me and him have been getting closer for the past few months, and he was being so sweet. He was helping me when I was down, and just being such a support through stuff I've been going through. He seemed like the perfect guy! But about a week ago, I kind of got lost in the moment, I guess. We did some... stuff. And I've never done anything like that before! Ever! So that was a really big deal to me.   The next day, he totally ignored me. He stopped talking to me, and bragged about how he got in my pants to his friends. About how I was just another notch on the bed post :(   His friends then told me about how he's been trying to get in my pants for months now.    I don't know what to do! I totally put myself out there by doing something like that, and he totally used me.    Maybe it's not really that big of a deal to other people, but it hurts so much to me :( So sorry if I'm being melodramatic or something. But I haven't told any of my friends, because I'm sort of embarrassed that I was that stupid. How do I deal with this?

20090309191447AAvgsY3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do to help out?	I have a friend who is going out with this guy, and she loves him to bits and he says that he loves her the same way. a few days ago they had a fight and he yelled at her and walked off. My friend was left crying well sobbing into my other friends boyfriends shirt,       He came back 15 minutes later and apoligised and said how it was all his fault and asked if they were cool. she said yeah and then the next day he hardly touched her and she looked like she was going to cry.        Then at recess she broke down again and said she felt that he was pushing her away and the more she tried to hang on the more he pushed her away.       I did my best to comfort her and then he came back to school ( he had gone off on an excursion untill lunch). she had been sending txts to her other friend who was on that excursion who had shwon him. when they got back he took her aside and told her that he was not pushing her away and what gave her that idea.       She told him the same things she told me, that when she hugged him he didnt hug back and stuff. he told her that he would never leave her and that he loves her. then the next day she tells me that they are okay. I watch them closely and you can see that she was lying.       It looked very strained between them. then they have 3 days away from each other over the weekend ( long weekend). and today she tells me the same thing as she told me on friday she feels as if after that fight the bond between them has changed a bit. he still tells her that he loves her and still calls her beautiful and babe and all of that stuff. she really loves him and he loves her but she still feels even though she knows he loves her and wont leave her she still feels as if he is slipping away.      what should she do and what can i do to help her should she talk to him about it or what?? i just want to know what i can do for her and some advice i can give her so she can help herself out.      thank you for your help.

In class I chat with everyone , and everything seems to be fine but when it comes to lunch ... a part inside of me dies !   I am not depressed I am very nice and confident .. It's just I don't fit in !   And I don't want too !   I simply won't make any friends so don't even think about it .

20090309184746AAycKFe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do i look like when i sleep with you?	Look, the problem may seem ridiculous and small, but it's a big deal to me. I'm confident with my body and my attitude when I have sex with my man. The only problem inhibiting me is my facial expression. Let's get into a bit deeper detail... He's on top of me, looking into my eyes, and all that good mushy stuff. I feel awkward because he is staring at me and looking at my face and I feel like I look kinda goofy when I make certain facial expressions. Especially "Oh f*ck yea! Baby!" expressions. So, it's just a little problem.      No, I'm not going to have sex only in the dark   I love myself, I just dont want a retard face when he's looking at me         Bottom line, I'm sick of having a neutral face during sex. I wanna be able to feel more bold in my facial expression, but Im too shy. What are some things I can do to get more comfortable with doing this?      Thank ya!
20090309193808AAmXTvG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have been seeking you all's help for a couple of weeks now. There is ONE person that knows me a?	little better than any of you. She helps everyone. But I am going to give you all a chance and see what you say. So here it goes. I think most of you know my husband is in jail, only til May. But a couple of weeks ago we got into an argument and he said that he wanted a divorce, he wanted something better and that he didn't want to be with me anymore. I cried and then got mad. So I disconnected the phone, threw my wedding rings away all in anger, as most women do....So about four or five days later he has one of his friends' that he is locked up with mom call me and ask for me to hook the phone up that he needs to talk to me badly. So like a dummy I did. When he called the next day all he could do was be mean and downgrade me. Never once said he was sorry or that he actually wanted or loved me. All he could say was how sick I always was and blah bah bah, nothing nice, just mean. So in the middle of him talking and putting me down I hung up. I honestly could not take it anymore. I have been going through this sickness and he gets mad at me. Whatever!!!! Like I was ever mad that he was a crack head....Anyway, he called all the next day, I didn't answer. I don't know why I didn't, I just know I didn't want to hear him belittle me. So I had not heard anything from him. Like a dummy I went to see him this weekend...two hours away....when he came into visitation he asked why I wasted my time? Why did I come and wake him up? That I didn't answer the phone for those days that he was done. Meanwhile he was wearing his wedding ring. Which I thought was funny. But anyway, he said that he was done because I had not answered the phone that I was wrong. I couldn't or didn't say anything. I don't know why. He said he was DONE and it was over and that I wasted my time, he asked if I had anything to say and I said NO. So he got up and we walked off. And that was that? Please tell me what you think? I don't understand WHY he even came to the visitation room? He could of easily said he didn't want to see me. I am seeking the help of a new friend and God. But It is late and I am kind of depressed and want to know what you all think. Do you think he will try and contact me again? And How do I get over him and STOP CARING and letting him CONTROL me??????????????????????????????????????...

20090309192202AAnyQtZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What did I do wrong to make her hate me?	Okay long story short, I was good friends with this girl a couple of years ago. I told her my feelings and she ignored me and over the past 2 years she either ignore me or became friends with me as it kept going back and forth. I still like her.      Okay now a couple of weeks ago she decided to talk to me again for the first time in like 4 months. She told me she didn't hate me anymore and so we had a nice conversation. She knows that I liker her as her friend asked me that earlier.The next day we also had a great conversation, said she didn't like me and don't want me to get the wrong idea and then added her on facebook later on. She didn't accept my invitation nor did she ignore it but she just didn't do anything to it as she did some other things on her facebook.      So I don't get to see her until Monday as it was Friday since we talked and the rest of the week I didn't really get to talk to her. On Monday I said hi to her and then on Friday I talked to her briefly on how she didn't talk to me the whole week, she just said that's unfortunate and din't really bothered. Then today I tried talking to her but she just ignored me and walked as fast as she can away from me. Later during the day I noticed she blocked me from facebook.      I honestly have no idea what I did wrong. I didn't really say much to her and nothing I said was really insulting to her as we had good friendly conversations with each other. She's really confusing as she said she didn't hate me a couple weeks ago and now she hates me even though I only said like no more than 20 words to her between that time.
20090309190757AATSpGk	Family & Relationships;Family	My cousin is gay and it bothers me, can u help?	Hi, im 16 and a straight male. My cousin that's 18 recently came out. He know has a boyfriend and my family is flippin a shi*t. Everyone keeps talking about it and its plastered all over his facebook. Im just like whatever, i dont want to hear it anymore its annyoing me. Honestly he can like guys all he wants, I just am alittle not easy about the whole flam-boyant thing. So basically its putting weird thoughts in my head and now i think everyone's gonna turn gay and im scared that i will cause i keep hearing about!! I recently was in love with this girl but she broke my heart and ever since then i dont think that i could ever love again and it makes me think that i'll turn the other way which i know if not true but still i think that happens to everyone. I also had a crush on this girl even more recently but now she's also out of my life and once again i feel that i will never find someone and i will be alone forever and i will never find that girl for me...I'm a nice guy but im also tough when i need to be. i have sisters so i think im a little bit more sympathetic towards girls n their feelings, n my nature is not to be a jerk.      so basically i just want some help, i know i will NEVER turn gay but sometimes when its the topic of ur family cause they just found out n all these years we all knew he was gay (my cousin) but now he's out n more flamming than ever...i do not have a problem with gay people cause i dont want anyone to think that its just that im not used to this being in my family and it bothers me a little. i just dont like when people are so open about it and all over the place with it. so can someone give me the assurance and comfort that i need that i really dont have to be worried about this sh*t? i know i will NEVER turn gay but right now its bothering me and getting me thinking, just cause its all around me latley..thanks!

I am a very confident person I have a lot of friends and i don't have a lot of worries on my mind except for my operation coming up. My little sister on the other hand is a different story. Shes the exact opposit. Shes very shy, she wants to blend in not stand out, she doesn't have a lot of friends or feel confident about herself. I didn't realize this until tonight after we performed at a show. Her 10 birthday is coming up and I thought what other way to make her feel special than a makeover. Get her some cute trendy clothes and maybe a new haircut or somthing. My sister isn't super skinny and she doesnt eat healthy. So I was wondering what type of clothing would best suit her and hes figure. It would help a lot if they were stores in Canada. Also she has super curly hair that can be pretty frizzy when she doens't take care of it. What type of haircut would suit her?      I know this is long but I feel so bad for thinking she was just a pain and not knowing it was because she wasn't confident. Pictures of hairstyles and clothes would really help me out.        Please help me out guys.  <3

20090309194946AALU95q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help my husband yells at me about every little thing having to do with our son.?	Because of the way he acts toward me our son favors him and any little reprimand I give him he ignores.  My husband is usually a nice guy but since we've had the baby he acts like I don't know what I am doing.  I am beginning to resent the both of them and feel really hurt that he is causing our baby to ignore my ideas.  I'm a new mother but I'm not stupid.  Has anyone ever had this experience?  What did you do?  What can I do without alienating my one year old when he gets older.      Here's an example, when I go to put our son to bed my husband follows me into the room and takes him away from me and says stuff like, "You don't know what you are doing."  Or once when I told my son to put something down my husband just waved me off and told me to leave him alone so he ran toward his father.  Oh my God, he's like a different person.

We hung out alot and went to bon fires and stuff like that. It came to my attention that she liked me. So i went straight to her. She admitted it but said she wasn't ready for a relationship.      My thoughts are because of what her best friends tell me   1) She doesn't want to jepodize our friendship. Which doesn't make scence because if we were to break up she would still be my best friend. Regardless.   2) She is a flirticious girl and she might think i will get jelous. She has guys lined up and she turns most of them down. This is odd because im not the hot shot of the school but she still likes me.      Whether i get to date her or not we are still friends but i would like to go on a date with her. For all you girls, what is going on. Because obvioulsy I don't understand

Before you all tell me I am "tacky" for asking my guests to bring their own drinks, please consider, Some people are really picky about what they drink and I dont want someone to say something like "They got aunt margie her HOT DAMN, why couldnt they get me some Irish whiskey"  just an example  but what seriously is the difference between providing a cash bar, or asking the guests to stock it themselves with drinks that they like and would prefer to drink.  In my invitations I provided a little card that stated.  "Our reception is BYOB, out of town guests will be shown to a close liquor store for your convenience."  I have talked to a few of the guests about it and they have agreed to get with other guests to find whos bringing what kind of alcohol to make different mixed drinks.  I got off on a tangent.  Anyway, if the guests are going to be out the money for booze anyway, whats the difference between Cash bar and BYOB???????

He even says he wishes he were dead. I tried talking to him, nothing. I tried cheering him up with jokes, nothing. I even tried sex, nothing. His eyes are empty and his voice is lifeless. What do I do??
20061122191012AAVNgbJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what should a guy write in his dating website emails?	I asked this awhile ago but I only got 3 answers.  Too many questions being asked here I guess.      So I'm trying to write to some girls on these dating websites but I don't know what to write. Totally out of my element here. I know you girls get lots of emails so I need to stand out.  First I have to get her to read the email.      That means I need a good subject. Any suggestions?      After I get her to actually read the email I haven't the slightest idea about what to say. I know I should try to be funny. And it should relate to her, obviously. But should I do anything else?      Should I tell her anything about me? Some things might not be in my profile.  Should I approach it casually (like a friend), very complimentarily (tell her how great she is), or like a stranger and just introduce myself?      I've tried everything people suggest and I have never gotten a response.      What would get YOU to respond back? Any of you have any experience about it, I'd LOVE to hear some examples.

20061116161556AANwtQc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hook up or be alone?	I feel that men in today's society don't want relationships/commitment with women (in my experience...and from what I see all around me). It's almost like I need to buy into the "hooking up" way of life or be completely alone. Why is that?  One night stands and random sex is NOT who I am at all. Does anyone else feel this way?
20090309203331AAu2neP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Marriage at 18 almost 19?	My girlfriend and I have been going out for almost 2 years.  She has joined the Air Force and is currently in Tech School.  We are able to deal with the long distance.  We both believe it has strengthened our relationship, and proved to many that we can last in tough times.          We have recently started talking seriously about getting married when she is on her 20 day leave after school.            We are both 18, she is 4 days older than I am, but are both mature for our age.  A lot of people compare our maturity to people in their 20's and say we have more maturity.          We both have goals and aspirations in life, and seek to help the other and ourselves succeed.  We have common values and beliefs on everything regarding marriage, including children.  She has her leave in June and we turn 19 in August.  We have been talking seriously about it for the past month.  Any thoughts on why or why wouldn't this work?

20090507075350AAR5mEf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you think weddings bring out people's worst behavior or their true character?	I'm just wondering if other brides have to deal with seemingly "out of nowhere" behavior from family and friends.   I ask because our Best Man is most likely going to back out of his position and possibly the friendship and we don't know why. I've also had aunt who got way too emotional just because I didn't like her idea for a bouquet. And my friend whom I asked to be guest book attendant/in charge of gifts has flaked out of our friendship because of a stupid gym membership (totally serious on this one).      Has anyone else dealt with attitudes and problems from people that you didn't expect?
20090309204825AAIE7cE	Family & Relationships;Family	I need to vent...............?	Im 16, Female. Well, my father got locked up when I was 6, and every since then Ive been rebellious. I forgave him because if I didnt, I wouldnt even talk to him. He gets mad when my mother and I argue because when he was gone, she was the only one there to lash out at, so Im used to it. He came back home when I was 10 and expected things to be the same as when he left. I was a preteen and when I would get 'smart' with my mom, he would threathen, even hit me sometimes. He left again, and got his own apartment and moved out. That made me even more angry. Then he came trailing right back into our lives like nothing happened. My mother pisses me off cause she excepts it like nothingg. When I was 13, on my birthday, he went out and cheated on my mom with some woman he met on a bus stop. He called from her house and cursed both me/my mom out. Then the woman called and called my mom all types of names, and threatened her. The next thing you know, he's right back in my mother's house like nothing happened. He blamed it all on me. Ive called the cops on him several times, the cops always side with him. He's left the house numerous times, for days at a time. Comes back with no explanation. My mom doesnt want me to ask questions, she gets mad when I get mad. Im supposed to act like nothing happened. Recently, he left, came back at like 3AM, and they were downstairs yelling, I shut my door because I was sleep and had school the next morning. Then, he yelled, "I CANT LIVE HERE WITH THAT BIT*H!!", talking about me. I ignored him for two weeks, up until today. Now Im back to ignoring both of them. Im seriously disgusted with them. Im messing up in school, they dont let me go out and get out of this house. Im sick of her letting him tropple over her. They blame me for everything. Im not the stereotypical teen, I dont do any wrong except for maybe not cleaning my room, and getting smart sometimes. They criticize me for everything and they dont do any wrong in their book. Im just sick of living here, and I feel close to insanity because I feel emotionally abused. I cry almost every week, it's really taking a toll on me. =( I feel like when he leaves, its the same as when I was 6, no explanations, not knowing what happened to my own father. Its just so overwhelming, and Im supposed to act like nothings going on. I just told them not to say anything to me anymore.
20090309195343AAIhAok	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a right to be mad at my bf?	I was supposed to see him yesterday but he left a voicemail and said that he's having a dinner with his family. Calls again and says its cancelled and that he can see him. A couple minutes later he cancels on me and promises he will see me today . (were both tired from work & it's late). I tell him I get off at 530.      I called someone to let him know that I get out at 7:15ish; I went to get my highlights.   I called him back afterwards and he tells me he needs to punish me and says that he'll see me tomorrow.  I called at 7:10 and I told him I was gonna see him at 5:30 yesterday. It was too late because he's with his friend's already.. I understand that he won't leave his friends because it's rude.       Do I have to right to be mad at him?

20061109184123AAEsoNd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is avoiding me when he really seems to like me?	He knows I like him.I know he likes me.We don't talk about our feelings,its just one of those things you know when it happens.(we have shared the most intimate moments,staring deeply into each other's eyes,talking while both being unable to control our huge smiles,holding each other close,even letting ourselves get carried away with the most intense kissing)We are both in relationships with someone else, and have kids,so we know that we could never be 2gether.He keeps telling me that he can't do it anymore,but keeps going back on his word.Although he keeps telling me this,he is always the one to make the first move(saying "my feelings for you haven't changed."moving in for a hug, or just flat out kissing me)That's what happened the last time we saw each other, the emotion between us felt so strong&He said "I'll see you soon."!Now he's been avoiding me for the past week. I can't get him out of my head.I am so hurt and I feel like this is all a game to him.   Why is he avoiding me now?

What are the signs of depression or else bipolar disorder? I have someone in my life who is my roommate. We don't always get along, and she tends to irriate me, but she doesn't know that. She has some problems with her life that really don't make sense. Sometimes they bother me because she cries hard and shouts into her cell phone as if I'm not present in the dorm. She has mood swings and she'd rather catch up on sleep than go to class, even though she does go to class. She works 2 jobs and one she really has trouble with. Can you please help me? I don't know what else to do. I've tried asking, but she obviously doesn't want to tell me about her problems but her friend and pretty much her boyfriend she's known for 2 months. Should I give her advice or stay out of it? I don't want to bother her if I speak up otherwise.

What do you feel the best way is for a parent or parents to work with their adult children to help them find a husband or wife.      These are some ways some people have tried.      Parents advertising and interviewing people for their sons/daughters.   Parents meeting people online to interview for their sons/daughters.   Parents going to a church's single's ministry to meet people for their son/daughter.   Parents arranging marriages.   Parents traveling to different countries, etc.      Those are just a few ways I have heard of parents getting involved in their children's lifestyle choices.      I only want to hear suggestions that include the son's/daughter's permission.

20070219124420AAeaVag	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think I'm in trouble...?	ok.here's the problem.i keep talking a lot abt my crush, & how cute he looks & some guys in his class had gone & told him that i talk of him in a wrong way & that i constantly keep on complimenting his looks.apparently,my crush thinks i'm a psychopath now(seriously-one of my friends had explained to him that it's just my hyper way of dealing with crushes & that it's my personality but he wasn't convinced)...now he's freaked out by everything i do.(he doesn't know me very well.we hardly talk & i assume he doesn't know my real character at all,or has even bothered to find out).when i confronted him abt this & apologised,he just told me that he didn't know who to trust.was this a wise thing to do?   plus i just want to know why he thinks i'm such a psycho.i mean,i don't think that ANYONE would be freaked out by compliments & attention,are they?   guys-what would you do in a situation like this?listen to your friends,or ask the girl herself?would you even give her a chance to explain?

20061226134657AAr4XTR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does this make any sense?	I found out some kid I know blocked me from their myspace. I don't talk much but we sit next to each other in class and are cordial. Anyway this kid seems to only put people he considers cool or whatever on there and takes people on and off quite frequently. DO you think maybe this kid doesn't want me on their list but doesn't want me to know that they have one so they don't hurt me or doesn't have to deal with me every day, even though I wouldn't dare bring it up. It's just wierd because they don't seem to hate me and don't seem to have anything against me. That's all I can figure, does it make sense? I'm not too worried about it anymore, because he took off one friend of mine off the list a while ago. Maybe this person just blocks people they don't want on the list. But I never talked to this person on myspace at all, maybe they knew I'd send them a friend request.

20061023082707AAJx0sI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you were the last man on earth with millions of women.....?	I choose this from a man's perspective because a woman's body could only give birth to so many before it gives out.  Men literally could spread the seed among thousands.  So answer this if you were a man regardless who you are.      So if you were the last man on earth, and you had enough time over the years to procreate the human species for survival with over 10,000 women.  How would you choose who to share your seed with?  Would it be by race or region of inhabitance, looks and beauty, personalities, health, emotional backgrounds or makeup, weight class, or size class?       Or would you just get it on with whoever is next in line?      Be as funny or as serious as you want.

20090309204153AAe40De	Family & Relationships;Family	How does a teenager deal with an alcoholic dad?	I am 14 years old and I live in a big house in a small, snobby, rich town. You wouldn't expect it, but my family is really messed up and I think that the root of those problems is my dad who is an alcoholic. He has admitted it a couple times (of course he was drunk when he admitted it, though) and he told me he would go to rehab. I asked him during the 5 minutes of the day that he is actually sober and not drunk or hungover if he would rather have his family or his booze and he told me to my face that he would rather have his booze because "we don't do anything to support him". I don't think that I have a reason to support him however because he has betrayed both mine and my mother's trust MANY times. He keeps telling us that he is going to get better and he will "stop" drinking for a couple days--and then my mom or I will find his hidden stash somewhere in the house. Soon he gives up on pretending not to drink and just gets drunk in front of us. My mom keeps telling me she is going to sell the house and divorce him, but it is never going to happen because she won't get any money out of it because he controls all of it and her family has absolutely no money at all. I just don't know how to deal with my dad and trying to be strong for both me and my mother, who is depressed and cries all the time. I feel like I shouldn't be the one taking care of both my parents as well as myself. I don't want to be selfish, but I have no idea what to do anymore I have been diagnosed with depression by three different pyschologists and my parents haven't done anything about it. I'm asking for advice for 1. dealing with my alcoholic dad who gets violent and mean (for example, what should I do when he approaches me when he's drunk?) 2. what should I do about my depression and how can I get the medicine I need without my parents? and 3. how do I stay strong?      *I have considered suicide more than once before.

20090309204627AAYoVjL	Family & Relationships;Family	Taking what my mom says seriously?	Should we take everything our parents say seriously?      I'm an only daughter and my mother always seems to give me advice on everything. It's mostly criticism. As in "You'll never be happy, you're a very stressed person, etc". When I try to reply back, she replies back again in a more bitter way. So I shut up. I shut up until she stops talking, which can take a long time.      Then she leaves my room and I get frustrated, because I feel that I'm exactly the way she describes me... because she's my mother, and if she says I'm selfish, I AM selfish.      Do I really need to take her seriously? If not, how can I NOT take her so seriously? Btw, I'm 18 years old.      Thank you :).

Autrefois, les gens n'avaient pas besoin de pleins de relations sexuelles avant le mariage, et ?a ne les rendait pas malheureux... Au contraire, ils étaient satisfaits de leur vie et ils n'avaient pas de problèmes... La religion chrétienne interdit les relations sexuelles hors des liens d'un seul mariage, comme le Christ l'a dit dans l'Evangile.

We recently moved in together about 6 months ago, and suddenly we fight ALL the time. He even took a vacation to get away from me for a week.

Well the other day we were just hanging out and talking because we have not talked in awhile. Then later that night he texted me and told me that he really likes me and he has for awhile.

Well the other day he told me that he only like me when i texted him but he couldn't like me when we were together in person.      What does this mean?   Does he like me or not?

20090309204037AAZ1fJ5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girls, I have a general question...?	So I am sixteen, and my girlfriend has been mad at me for about a week now. She's quiet and has a very sweet personality (she's also one of those preppy kinds of girls, lol). I had been going through a lot of stress lately and I finally lost it and she was, unfortunately, the recipient of that repressed stress. Anyway, she had been pretty pissed at me but her friends had told me that, as of late, she had missed spending time with me. I wanted to do something cute to apologize, so here's what I did: I bought a small stuffed animal, taped a note to one of its paws which read: "The guy who bought me is really sorry. I think he's a jerk, but he really wants you to forgive him", and left it inside her locker earlier today. Now, the next time I see her, I plan to give her a hug. I haven't recieved any calls from her yet, but do you think this was a cute way to apologize?
20070216134453AAtOlzT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I so afraid of physical contact with my girlfriend?

Anyway I can easily talk to her (even though i'm generally a shy person) and, we give each other hugs at least once a day, but i can't bring myself to put my arm around her or hold her hand, I've put my arm around her once when we were walking down the hall and she looked at me kind of blushing and was smiling and it felt great but I can't get myself to do it more often I always feel nervous and am afraid i might weird her out.. what do i do?
20061107090931AAUNeEP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to know if i should ask this boy i like if he likes me help!!! i need advice and answers please!?	i like this boy named sam. I told him that i liked him at homecoming and he didn't say anything but smiled and then we just held hand after. Then at school it got awkward after the homecoming dance. We would talk but not as much as i would have thought(since we did go to the dance and he told my friend that he really liked me).I asked one of his friends(jack) to ask him about the situation. Sam told jack that he felt pressured.I was upset.A week past and then on the day of halloween he put his arm around me and then we held hands.The day after nothing happened. we talked and laughed as usual but he never held my hand like the day of halloween.He didn't give me any explanation of why he did that. This week i have had the URGE to just go up to him and ask him if he likes me. it looks like he likes me cause he doesn't really treat others like that.if his answers no to my question because he doesn't want a gf i don't want him to stop having feelings for me.i want him to still like me.

I comforted her while she was upset, but for the past week she avoided me.  She didn't call or even ask me how my day was- this is stuff we have been doing every day for the past three months since we've been really good friends.  Now she is talking to me again, but she's pretending like nothing happened.  Everything she does seems to annoy me.

She feels like someone has done something wrong but won't talk about it and she will pretend that nothing ever happened when she is confronted with the issue.  What should I do?

Bare in mind, she and I have known each other for about six years.  During that time we've constantly acted like and refered to each other as brother and sister.  Literally, we have friends who are shocked to realize we're not biologically related.  Anyway, long story short she's recently started hitting on me.  I know, I know...guys can misunderstand friendliness for flirting but I've known her for six years, I know which she's doing and when she's doing it.  I want to explain to her that this just feels weird coming from her, but to do it in such a way that I can still retain the same type of friendship we've enjoyed having.  Anyway have any suggestions?

20090309203702AA0O5Zx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need some advice before I fall apart?	Okay.   My mother left with my younger brother and sister on a morning over 2 months ago.   My father and I didn't hear anything from them for 19 days.   She went to Mariposa and said an awful lot of things to the domestic violence advocates there about my dad beating us and his beating and controlling my mom. None of those things have ever happened.   There is just so much more than that.   I was molested by my cousin when I was 5 on Christmas Eve and nobody knew until 5th grade.   I went through the court for that until 8th grade.   Well, when my cousin came up here to stay with us before it all came out [my grama knew the whole time and said nothing] my mother slept with him.   That is why the police raided out house and why they found out about what he did to me.   She got Herpes from him as well.   I found that out after she found herself a new boy toy down in Fresno and stared taking trips down there every day and meeting him for breakfast while she was still with my dad.   My dad wasn't pissed about it til she brought this guy to the house and had him picking up my little sister, on his own, after school.   She had known him in highschool and found him through Myspace.   She didn't know whether he was a molester or what and still had him picking up my little sister.   I have not seen my brother or sister since the night before they left and it hurts me to think about them.   I was going to go to the Supervised visitation, cause my dad is such a bad guy right?, but she told them that I molested my little brother.   So I ended up not being able to go and see them with my dad.   My heart aches now.   I hope she trips and falls and lives the rest of her wretched life in a vegetative state.

We knew it was probably her time since Christmas, and she went in the hospital and then home for hospice care.      It's all so surreal, I don't know how to cope.  Life feels fake, then overwhelming pain comes in, then it goes back to feeling fake again.  I sat by her side and touched her head as she passed on, but i don't want to keep seeing that image.  Will it go away so i can remember the way she used to be?
20090309200259AAiRrEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i bring this up with my boyfriend?	He's in his late 20's I'm in my early 30's.  It seems we never spend "time alone" unless it's late at night once my son is asleep.  It's not that we don't hang out together, just never me and him.  We are always with his friends or something.   I want him to hang out with his friends and to do what he wants to do, but if he's not giving me the time I feel like I should get now, what's going to happen when the "honeymoon" phase is over.  How can I get him to know that he's going to have to make time for us, not me him and my son, not me him and his friends, but just us.

20090309201704AA1zLIx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my girlfriend turn lesbian on me?	So here is my story, i met my ex at a club. In the beggining i didn't like her, in fact i would i always try to hide from her (yeah i know it's sad). But she will always be there, she knew a lot of my friends, so she would always be at the clubs and parties i was at. She would call me, and leave me comments on myspace. She was a very caring, independent, sweet, down to earth, and nice person. So i went for it, and we finally started dating. After two months of dating, i fell deeply MADLY in love with her. I met her mom, her son (oh yeah she has a son who is two years old), her sister, and her brother. They all loved me, and i loved all of them. Its funny because her mom always loved showing me off to the whole family; I loved it. Everything was perfect, for the first time i felt like i wanted to marry this girl and adopt her child; i was love drunk. Two months before we broke, she started acting different. Her stories did not add up, she wanted to go out with friends all the time. It used to be that we would hang out almost 4-5 times a week, then only once a week!!! i knew there was something wrong, it was not the same when we would hang out. She would go to gay clubs, that i knew and i actually like that idea then her going to straight clubs were all the horny dudes were gonna be all over her (little did i know). So to make a long story short, it turns out that she broke up with me because she fell in love with some girl. Now my question is why? why all of a sudden did she turn lesbian? i mean could it be curiosity? well anyways i just want to know what you guys think about this.

20061030072330AAXK3oY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are we more than friends now?	A good friend of nearly a year and I both got out of long term relationships within the past month.  She had given me some clues that she was into me and I became interested in her.  There is sexual attraction, I know that for a fact.      Over the past few weeks we ended up spending the night together twice (no sex) but with some cuddling, heavy petting and kissing.        We kiss whenever our mutual friends aren't around.  I asked her what was going on, and she said she didn't know, but we have both said that we liked one another.  She's become quite flaky, lately, however, and when we are apart we hardly talk at all - she's not good at returning calls even though she asks me to call her, but when we are together she holds hands and asks me to stroke her hair and such, and she is very receptive to my physical advances.      What's the situation seem like to you guys?

20061105042038AAbG4hq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if a decent looking guy approached you and asked you out because of your feet?	I find women with pretty feet to be very attractive.  I've approached attractive women in public for many reasons in the past.  As expected sometimes I was successful, other times I wasn't or made the mistake of approaching someone with a boyfriend who was in the area but not readily visable.  However, there have been times that I went out with a woman and later was disappointed to find out that her feet were hideous and stuck with her anyway because of other things about her that I liked.  This has caused me to just want to approach a woman and ask to see her feet before a give my rap and ask for her number.  What would you do if a guy did this with you?      [What's a pretty foot?: The higher the arch, the better.  Second toe longer than the first prefered but not manditory.  Big round heel (as opposed to a heel of narrow width) prefered but not required.  A little foot odor is a bit of a turn on...that is, as long as it's actually a "pretty" foot & not an ugly thing hiding in a shoe.]

20061106191246AAYLef1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i go with his brother?	Is it sleazy to be in love with a guy but have him not want you and not know if he ever will?   and to go out with his younger brother (once I get over him).   Cuz his younger brother treats me better and actually cares about me.   He always has but I always thought I was meant for his older brother.   The older guy could care less if I find another guy, and the younger guy (I don’t love him but him are close, and always have been)   wanted me, so he asked me out, i said yes we went out for only like 2 days but we never saw each other or talked to each other I feel bad for not choosing the guy who always cares about me, and loving his brother who wants me to find someone new instead of waiting for him to maybe change his mind.   Please tell me that’s NOT sleezy.   I just want a good guy who appreciates me and loves me through and through and will be with me no matter what happens.   Is it sleezy?

20061115175946AAzCYEU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I feel like this?	I want to be lonely sometimes and then, sometimes, I just want to be with a really attractive girl who has a great personality and will listen to me. I know several nice girls who are very attractive. I love girls, and sometimes I am obsessed with one, but I'm shy around girls. I think it's because I'm afraid to say something stupid in a conversation and make a fool of myself, because I get embarassed easily. I am told I'm attractive, and I have a pretty good body, but how do I get confidence? When I get angry at myself for not getting a girlfriend, I just hate love and want to be lonely. Why is this?

20061116201318AAiZfPC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I (heart) you?	Okay, time for another love conundrum.   So I like this girl. I have ever since I met her, you might even be able to say love at first sight.      And don't worry I didnt only fall for her looks. I got to know her and we got really close and she's just awesome. So eventually we got to a point where we were really close...like:   Holding hands   Writing love notes ect ect      Then summer comes...I live in the country she lives in the city. I barely get to see her.      I start school again and she's dating some other guy. So I was jealous...not angry at her or anything just...dissapointed.      So then...now in november I heard they broke up about 2 weeks ago. So at that point I was desperatly trying to get over her cause it was just too hard. So I was hanging out with another and thinking maybe I'm developping a crush on her.      Then today in Georaphy she writes in my binder..I see her sign her name then I look away. Then class ends and I get my binder back. In Math I open it up and read her signature.      Then I freeze. Not a panic but a stun. a flap in my binder it sayd " I (heart) you" with an acctual heart. So i'm wondering...does this mean anything? What do I do? Do I pretend I didnt find it? Do I confront her?      And now...do I keep trying to get over her? Am I overreacting? Was I really crushing on this other girl or was I desperate to get over her?      Sorry you had to read that whole thing...and asked so many question...every little advice helps!!

20061124055952AAjm2D5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have NO Sex drive. Since his six month cruise?	I am 26. I am not on birth control. I am taking no mecidations.       My Fiance and I have been together for about 3 years now.  When our relationship first started I had no problems with getting arroused.  My fiance came home from his 6-month cruise about a month ago. Since he's been home we've only had sex twice. The first time seemed "ok". We tried a second time and It felt "wrong", I couldn't get arroused.  A third time he came to my while I was sleeping, and there wasn't any problem, but since I can't seem to get in the mood. I feel horrible each time he tries and... nothing. Everything else in the relationship is great. Its better than when he left.       We are gonna try letting me be the one who approaches him, that way there is no pressure, or added stress on me.      I would like to know if there is anyone else out there who's had this problem, and if it worked itself out naturally.  Is there anything my partner and I can do to help the process

I recently found out that she had a crush on me.  I never actually asked her out but we've hooked up two nights in a row, hold hands and all that stuff.  I feel that we're in a relationship but when other people ask her, she says no but that she would like to be.  We've been very open about what is happening so shes obviously not trying to keep it a secret.        Is she waiting for me to "ask her out" officially?  If so, specifically,  how should I do that when I thought I had implied it already.

20070104224840AAKf7m1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men, do you prefer an honest woman or  one keeping secrets and playing mysterious?	Do you want her to have a life of her own and meet yours from time to time or only under some aspects, or do you want her to share everything to you, to be as one, to trust her not only with your life but with your soul also? I mean the one to share your life to, not one night or one year relations.
20070110125024AAyh3jy	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriend doesn't want to have anything to do with my family.  We all used to be very close.  What do I do?	We have been together 5 yrs.  Over the summer my parents offered to sell me my grandparents home after my boyfriend and I had worked on it for weeks.  They did not consider him in the deal at all.  We backed off from the house and my boyfriend backed off from my parents.  He has been disrespected by them and now does not want to have anything to do with them.  We went to a therapist who advised us to cut ties.  I am having a hard time with this and my mom makes me feel guilty when I choose not to do things with her.  Also, we have had a few other problems since and are working through them.   My mom knows of our problems and does not think  am in a good relationship and keeps attacking me about it.  Sge thinks that he is being controling and our therapist says she actually is.  We are very much in love with each other and want things to work out.  My boyfriend also has a daughter who he does not want to have contact with my parents anymore.  What do I do?

The girl wanted to to say goodbye to him so she told him she would call him b4 she left he said OK and when they talked on IM he always asked where are you. Then he just disappeared...the girl still sends him sms messags and told him she likes him but he not sure where she is or what up with her and the other guy..but it seems that he is hiding from her Why? He is really nice guy and wasn't after sex and they do know each other not just IM friends..do you think he wanted more than just friends?

He stuck with me the whole time, even though a lot of girls wanted to dance with him. He always says I am amazing, but that I am pretty crazy too. He is such a great guy and to tell you the truth, I don't know...I guess I might kind of like him. I am just so confused, especially since my boyfriend and I just broke up. So, what do you think? Does he like me or not? Thanks =]

20070520170809AAj60Df	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do I feel this way about moving away for a career chance?	I just graduated college a couple of weeks ago and I have been looking for a job. I am scheduled for a couple of interviews in these towns about 4 hours away from where I live. While the towns are nice and the job is good, I am not sure if I will accept if I am offered. I would feel more comfortable being a little closer (like 2 hrs away) from home. Why is this? I am kind of confused because I want a big break, but am really nervous about going this far. I was an army brat so moving shouldn't be a big deal as compared to someone who was born and raised in 1 town. I lived in this current place for about 10-12 yrs now and feel comfortable, although I am not happy. It doesn't have any CAREER opportunities for me. I am scared I will be unhappy there for some reason, I guess. Why? What's wrong? Aren't you supposed to want to do this? Why do I feel like this inside? Please give your honest opinion and advice.
20070428191158AAmfIWS	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Non-corny/lame wedding card phrases??	My boyfriend and I are attending the wedding of one of his friends (they're not too close; I've never met him, but my boyfriend has only good things to say about him). We found a gorgeous blank card; what should we write in it? I've found a tonne of quotes online...they're all too generic, too religious (we're not really sure of their beliefs, and we're both atheists) or too "sentimental". Do you know of any great song lyrics, quotes from a "counter-culture" figure, etc. that would work well in a wedding card?    Please, please help! I'm an English major so this should be easy for me...it *would* be easier if I actually knew the couple. My boyfriend has asked me to do the card "because you're a better writer."    Looking for intelligent help, please! No links to massive online databases please; I've already tried that! Thanks!

20070421210049AAeLxSG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please, I need advise please?	when someone is at fault and confront the situation they manipulate the situation to the person they did wrong? My ex hurt me badly and whats interesting is he did the same thing to his daughter and the situation he was in. He gave up all rights to his child when he got a one night stand pregnant before we met. He was very ashamed and hurt and depressed, even suicidal over it. Well, I helped him thru alot and when he finally came to terms with this, he left me to be with the mother of his child. But when I found this out he turned cold to me, would not confront me and practically made me feel like I never existed. He can't talk to me anymore and made me feel bad about the situation, by treating me this way. Now he and that girl are no longer together and he realizes she isn't the girl he wanted to be with. But he has developed a relationship with his child, which is great, but he left me in the dust. In a way, I brought them together and I feel no sense of appreciation

Skinny-ness and high metabolism runs in the family, And I eat nothing but junk food and good amounts of it. There would be no way I could give up food, I love it too much. But sometimes I don't eat alot because I get full quickly, And she takes this the wrong way. She always says how I need to eat more and more but it makes me sick to stuff myself. We always get into little spats about this because I'm not anorexic and I ish she didn't think I was. She gives me speechs on 'How she only wants me to be a decent weight and not so skinny.' I can't help that I don't gain weight like a monster. How can I get her to stop thinking this way?

Mas ano passado, tivemos uma briga feia e terminamos durante 1 mês. Nessa ocasi?o ele num momento de raiva jogou a alian?a dele fora (na verdade ele a amassou com um martelo!). Ent?o, quando voltamos a namorar n?o usamos mais alian?a. Desde ent?o, eu venho pedindo pra ele comprar alian?as novas e tal...  até sugeri q a gente usasse aquele anel q vem no Cheetos pois nós tínhamos 2 daqueles! Mas ele n?o quis, e nem quer comprar alian?as novas. Ele diz q acha besteira e q n?o é preciso de alian?a pra dizer q ama. Eu concordo com isso, mas acho bonito usar alian?a... sou super romantica...    No final deste ano, ele vai viajar pro exterior por no mín 6 meses e eu estou pensando em comprar as alian?as antes dele ir, já q ele nao compra. O q vcs acham?    a) N?o fica meio esquisito eu comprar por ser a mulher?   b) Será q ele n?o quer comprar ou será q ele n?o quer usar mesmo nenhuma alian?a, nem q eu compre?

20070430063523AADVuW6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FOR THE MEN! What did you think when a female cried during intercourse.?	I went to my friends house to tell him how I felt&to brake up the relationship.He would have settled for us just being freinds,but i knew i would give in to him everytime we talked or were together if we ended up just freinds.I helped him get on his feet when he was down on his luck & in my mind I think he still loves his ex,which has came over already to his new apartment.I told him if she came over I would never come back.We had only been together for about 6months.He might just be freinds with her but I have a hard time trusting him.Anyway last night i ended up staying the night. And he was sooo good in bed that I cried while having intercourse&I told him i could not take anymore of this and he stopped for a minute at first but really i was enjoying it and let him continue.The thought that i had made mind up to not talk to him anymore was driving me crazy&we both knew this was the last time.I'm wondering what he was thinking when i cried. I am not going to even talk via cell 2 him.

20070522141735AAVWR8O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are relationships so much work?	Lately my boyfriend of seven months is not as sweet as he was when we first met and I can't figure out a way to tell him that I need more affection to where it will click with him.  Yet in one day, he will ask me to rub him atleast 3+ times in about 5 hours but hardly ever thinks that I may want the same affection.  Then when he does rub me, he does it roughly and for about 1/3 of the time.  When I try to explain the situation and the affection being expressed through a rub/contact he says I'm complaining and 30 min later asks me to rub him or makes a big deal like its a chore.  Why is it so easy for guys to see what they want/need but so hard for them to understand how others may feel?  He does express his love for me in other ways but I am feeling neglected in an area that I am used to having an abundance.

20070512231021AAHNYHp	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it weird to hug your best friend?	My friend and I are both guys and when I came into high school, the people in the band were really close. Being impressionable as a freshman, I saw it as ok for guys to hug and all. It's been 2 years since then and I have this friend who is also in band and has seen nearly the same thing. It's not like I make a habit out of hugging him everytime I see him, but it helps me when I'm upset and I just do it to show him I care. But, when I go to hug him, he gets all defensive and tries to get away and acts like its weird. It really confuses me because I've seen him hug other guys like nothing, he's even asked for one from some of them. I wonder if its me. Maybe he thinks I'm weird or something. I don't think he thinks I'm gay because he knows me well enough and I have a girlfriend that I love to death and he knows that. I don't know what to think about this.

There's a girl at work that want's to take me to a metal show, She is "seeing" someone long distance and when she told me she was "seeing" someone she kind of didn't sound to enthused about it and did the whole Quotation fingers thing right? So The Type O show is tomorrow, I was wondering if I should ask her if she has any plans tomorrow night, early in the morning when we talk. She seems a little bit interested in me. but i'm not shure if she would go with me or not, I'm on the guest list for it and I have one more spot open. Do you think I should ask her or not? Like i said she invited me to a metal show after I asked her to go see Grindhouse today. She didn't say no to the movie she just kind of changed the subject and invited me to the metal show haha. SO.. since she is "seeing" someone I'm not to shure that i have too good of a chance with her.

I don't feel connected with her anymore, and haven't in the past 6 months or so... she does have 2 kids, ages 10 and 7, she is 29 and I am 24.  To be honest, I am just not happy in the marriage anymore.  There's nothing that connects us together it feels like, and I feel like I've fallen out of love.  Honestly I cannot even remember why we got married.  We have been together since Dec. 21st of 2003, married since March 17th, 2005.  Maybe I just want to be single again and have the thrill of dating around, I don't know.  I was 22 when we got married.  She says she loves me and really wants to make this work, but she says that she can't control how I feel.  Any advice????

20070610152235AAXUdn1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't get it...?	There is guy that I have known my whole life because our moms are best friends and everything and I guess you could say that we used to go out and we have liked eachother for almost as long as we have known eachother. Then I moved and don't get to see him very often so I try to tell myself that I don't have feelings for him but I know that I could never not have feelings for him. Recently I found out that he got in some trouble at school which sort of reminded me about how much we sort of relied on eachother to be there for the other one and how I haven't really been there for him lately which made me feel really bad. I think that I still might really like him and I can't believe that I am saying that but I miss him and I feel like I need him in my life and I am losing him. What should I do, move on or keep trying until something great happens?
20070524014945AAyWlA4	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend got a boyfriend, and she's being hiding it from me. I dn't understnd why? Where do i stand now?	During the past 3 yrs not only have my best friend and I gotten close, spent heaps of time together, but we have become a masive part of each others lives. We both have different friends, we're pursueing different careers but we have this amazing bond. We;re crazy about one another, and miss each other even when its only been 2 days. Strangely enough she is also capible of driving me nuts and making me really frustrated. We argue a hell of a lot, but mostly only because we can't agree and we're both too stubborn to give in, even though halfway through the conversation we both realise that none of us was making sense. Last week I spotted her holding hands and being really close with this guy twice. Apparently everyone know that she's dating this guy, except for me.  She kept this from me.

20070316223445AArEUyq	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does it mean when a guy say this?	Okay so we were talking about intellegent jokes that only the in crowds understand. So I made up a stupid one about x and y variables in Algebra. Then he tells me the "What did the proton say to the electron?" joke, In which the answer was "I'm attracted to you."      Also also he has been known to punch his siblings (violent I know but not the point) and once he slapped my shoulder by accident, but it did not hurt.   So my friends were calling him a sibling beater, but then he asks why he did what he did to me if I wasn't close to him like a sibling. Which sounds quite insulting at first, but I think he just word it wrong.      He said both of these on the same day, so what do you guys think? Is there a deeper meaning that hes trying to tell me he likes me? Or should I think nothing of it? If you were me or him, what would you think of it?   thanks

20070609095402AAaCCjx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is up with this girl?	I've know this girl for about 3 years and we've been hanging out with each other a lot lately, like an entire 26 hours together and we slept only 4 of those, we spent the night in the same bed and I believe she was giving me signs to kiss her, I was like 95% sure, but I held back. A few days after that we hung out and I said, there is something I have been meaning to do for a long time, and I leaned in for a kiss. She pulled back and I said what can I not kiss you? She said don't make it any harder and don't be disheartened, and she said she was going through drama and I asked if that mattered and she said she didn't know why it did but it did. She then said she's thought about it and held it back, I said I had too. She then said don't worry it'll happen. We've hung out since then and everything seems normal. She called me out of the blue one day after that and asked if I wanted to come over to her house and hang out for a while and I came over we watched TV and talked until she had to work. I’ve visited her at work as usual. I asked her out to dinner recently, not really as a date but not really as friends, it wasn't classified. She asked if her married friend could come along, I didn't want to be mean and said yes, because it technically wasn't a date. While we ate she seemed more flirty and touchy feely towards me then usual. Then her and her friend were throwing peanuts at each other and one went down her shirt, I’m not sure if she was joking but she said do you want to get that to me. I was laughing too hard and said I’ll get the next one. She goes oh you'll get the next one? I said yes. Then we went to hang out after dinner and while she was telling a story, she kept touching my face to prove her point. Then we went bowling, while we were bowling she said something to her friend, when I asked what she said, her friend said she said she likes you. Then the girl I like said that’s not what I said, then I asked her what she said and she said oh your falling behind the bowling game. Then once we were on our way home she mentioned this other guy she likes that her dad is trying to hook her up with, that she has mentioned before and she keeps telling me she likes. I'm not sure if she's telling me that to make me jealous or what. But she has went to where this other guy works and left her number for him, and when she mentioned him she said I wonder if he got my number. Then when she got home and after I got home, she called me to say thank you, we talked on the phone for another hour, then I told my mother goodnight and I love you too while I was on the phone. Then the girl said oh you do? I said well yea, but I was actually talking to my mom. She said I know I just wanted to see what you said. The next day I visited her at work and we discussed going out again we didn't set up a time or date we just ensured that we would. I talked to her the next day on the phone for a few minutes about getting a job where I work and how to apply then about random stuff, then her mom said something, then she said I know and said she had to go. The next day I called her and told her what my people at work had said in a voicemail, then asked if she wanted me to rent a movie and bring it over to her house to watch that night since she was off. I called her yesterday and I haven't heard from her since the day she called about the job which was 4 days ago, she hasn't returned my calls. This weekend she's out of town with her family. Should I wait until about Monday to call her again or what? Is she avoiding me or am I being played or am I over analyzing things?

20070610051847AAqfC65	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think she means? Tips to proceed?	I've been talking to this one girl and I asked her out. She called me, seemed happy and said she probably has the time to go out with me. Next day I called her and called it off (checked the schedule, I had an entrence exam), and I said I'll go out with her some other time, she didn't seem too happy about it (she had an offensive tone?) plus she thought it was just some made up excuse. Later that day she texted me and asked where am I and told me she was going to this bar, but I told her that I wont go there since I really dont like that place (dont ask why). Her last message to me was just an blank text message.    What do you recon I should do?   I should've probably gone to see her since she came to town.    Just be casual, keeping in touch with her and ask her out again?   she still interested?   I like her, but I never feel that relaxed when talking to her, I always feel like shes pushing me. I still intend to go out with her, though. be friends first, to get to know her?      -Thanks

Last week, I was waiting outside the lecture hall and he was there having a cigarette.  Anyway, I was sitting on the bench across from him and trying to make eye contact, but he was wearing sunglasses.  LOL.  So I'd look in his direction and then look down or look away.  He was talking to one of his friends and I think he noticed me looking because he looked in my direction and his speech started slowing down to the point where he stopped talking for a few seconds and just looked in my direction.  We have one more class before finals and I'd like to chat with him.  Should I just give him looks and wait for him over to me come or what?

Today I went over there and ask for her number.  When I did she said "not yet" cause today was only the second time I had ever seen her so I guess this was to be expected.  I really like her though and I am so shy that it took so much effort just to ask for her number the first time.  I asked when the next time that she worked and she said "tomorow"  I told her that I may come, and talk to her again tomorow and she had an attitude like "dont try too hard to do that" or something of that effect.  I am so shy and I dont wanna scare her away.  So, what should I do?  I need help extremely bad!

I never tried the friendship thing with the most recent ex but now the opportunity to re-establish communication has occurred... is it worth it? why do you keep in touch with your exes? why not? what horror stories/great stories do you have?

20070414163847AAMnYBG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get that girl?	Theres a girl in my High School that of course i just had to get a crush on...I have 2 classes with her and in 1 i even sit right behind her.  I can't get her out of my head but im too shy of a person.  I tell myself to try and talk to her the day before but right when i see her i just keep walking.  Of course shes the pretty popular type which kinda makes my quest hopeless.  Im not ugly but i guess best to put myself as average.  Is there anything to talk about that would carry on a conversation with someone that barely knows you? And how would you get there attention without making it too obvious that im trying to flirt with her.  Basically just asking whats the best way to try and get her to notice me without trying to be too obvious?  Any advice is great.  Thanks

20070416164122AAwvUzP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	No one is really "sorry" for anything they do?	people never really seem to regret any of their actions until/unless they get caught doing them and/or they affect someone else or hurt someone else's feelings. This is a clear indicatior that they are not truly sorry for their actions, but rather only sorry that they got caught or sorry that someone else was affected by their actions. But by no means are they truly sorry for their actions because if they were sorry for their actions then they would have felt bad before they ever comitted the action or would not have comitted it at all.

20070430052101AA9jVgr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am in love with a girl in Australia, she most likely cant come here, I have little to no cash.?	And I am so awkward when it comes to these things I don't even know if she has feelings for me. I have told her how I feel but she never gave a full answer. She only said she really likes me but cant be in a true relationship with me because her last long distance relationship ended in heart break. This statement only caused me to start and make plans of going out to visit her, see if it can really work, and if things feel good ask her if she wants me to come back out to stay with her. It is extreme, but I have really fallen in love with her, and I feel if I give up without trying my hardest, than I'm pretty much worthless. My problem is approaching her. She's been out of touch for a while because if her family. and things are vague. I'm not even sure if she has a boyfriend now. When I get in touch with her again, I want to talk with her about how strongly I feel about this. What should I do?

20070511164429AAOwX0n	Family & Relationships;Friends	I wanna help my frend--her mother passed away almost 2 years ago and now Mother's Day is coming up...help...!	Ok, my frend moved to this town almost 3 years ago. She's really cool and has been one of my true frends since...idk...A VERY LONG TIME. But...after a year when she moved here...her mother sadly died of illness. I felt so bad for her, and she missed school for almost 4 months.      Right until now, she was an ok, happy-go-lucky kid. She was ONE of my good (u can say "best") frend. She's helped me through nearly EVERYTHING (especially my parents divorce).      But this year has been BAD. Really BAD. A lot of people have been making fun of my frend cuz of her deceased mother. My gosh they are so cruel SCREW THEM!      And the worst part is that it's almost Mother's Day. I wanna help my frend, but she's always like "Oh It's Ok, I'm Fine! Don't Worry!" But I know that something's very wrong. Like during Spanish class, we made Mother's Day cards in Spanish. She wrote it to her grandmother but was quiet during the whole time. I think I'm gonna make her a gift to make her better. Any ideas? Thanks!

Hes a doc, and Im an RN, however, we dont work together, he is my sons doc. sparks have been flying for a while, then last visit he asked me to go golfing with him. Said he would call me when he was going. I then sent him a letter to his office and invited him to my myspace page which has a lot about the side of me he never knew, with all my modeling pics and even some of him. He made a profile, and sent me a message regarding a sad blog I had written. HIs message said Lonliness: it is a state of mind. And THATS IT!!! no comments on my pics or our trip and then worse than that, no response from him for 3 days now after I sent him 2 messages that I had something I wanted to say to him.Why would he go out of his way to make a profile, and then say nothing more than that?Did I scare him away?

20070528150351AA2T6FH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Call him or no?	Heres the story (it’s pretty detailed, sorry): Nik, my ex, is in a band with Matt. I met Matt once & he came off as a HUGE ******. Matt had told Nik that I was one of the best looking girlfriends he's had later though.    Fast forward another 3 months...   Nik and I are broken up and we're not allowed to speak (I ended up having to switch schools and no contact with Nik was allowed). I later found out from a friend Nik was transferring to the same school to. I panicked because I knew this would cause trouble for me and I sure as heck didnt want to get involved w/ him again. So I called Matt. I asked him if he knew. He then said it wasn't true & we actually talked about a lot of stuff; he kept saying that he and his girlfriend were broke up FOR GOOD. And we seemed to have a bunch in common. Near the end of the conversation before I hung up he said: If you ever want to talk again, you can call me. (something like that)…   Should I call him? & what should I say b/c I dont really know him?

I just gave in and said he had the cutes dimples. Then he tried to push the cute dimple away by holding he breath and making blowfish cheeks!      Is he interested in me or not? From the sound of things?

20070807203934AAeSiZ9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Saving a friendship help again :)?	i wrote this before: so, my friend (a guy) and i got into a fight last  last monday. i don't exactly remember what it was about, but it totally changed our friendship. he stopped taking my calls, and even blocked me on aim.    then, i went up to him in person and was like "can we talk?"   then he said "i don't want to talk to you because we always get into fights" then he left...   i sent him an e-mail a couple  days ago and he hasn't answered. the e-mail was everything i wanted to say like if it was the end   i really don't want it to be over because i've known him for like 7+ years. also, he thinks that what i have to say always has to be about our friendship and he's tired of it.    my friends haven't been that supportive because they've been hearing about this since..forever. i would really like for him to see the real side of me, without all the fighting. I can't do it because he's avoiding me. How can I talk to him without bringing up what happened and hopefully resolve it? i miss him
20070714225759AAlfhnE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When wearing a cardigan alone, what is considered buttoned appropriate? [females only]?	Right before I left on my date, I suddenly got really nervous about the date itself for some unknown reason so I just unbuttoned my cardigan. The outfit I wore was a blue cardigan with khakis and put on a baseball jacket. Once we got to the restaurant, my date pulled me aside and asked what was wrong. I was just was extremely nervous and once she coaxed me to take off my jacket she realized that my sweater needed to be buttoned which she did without hesitation. She asked me why my sweater was unbuttoned when she buttoned it up, I couldn't answer. She kept telling me of how much she liked the cardigan outfit I wore and wants to have another date with me wearing another cardigan outfit. I think we hit it off well and want to avoid the extended nervousness that led to the beginning of tonight's date. She kept asking me about buttoning up the cardigan appropriately for our next date I am planning on scheduling a nap time before this date.

Já perdoei erros quase imperdoáveis,   tentei substituir pessoas insubstituíveis   e esquecer pessoas inesquecíveis.       Já fiz coisas por impulso,   já me decepcionei com pessoas quando nunca pensei me decepcionar, mas também decepcionei alguém.       Já abracei pra proteger,   já dei risada quando n?o podia,   fiz amigos eternos,   amei e fui amado,   mas também já fui rejeitado,   fui amado e n?o amei.       Já gritei e pulei de tanta felicidade,   já vivi de amor e fiz juras eternas,   “quebrei a cara muitas vezes”!       Já chorei ouvindo música e vendo fotos,   já liguei só para escutar uma voz,   me apaixonei por um sorriso,   já pensei que fosse morrer de tanta saudade   e tive medo de perder alguém especial (e acabei perdendo).

20070803120623AAiIND7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I make of her?	Was out with friends from work, one of them a woman I'm interested in. Most of these friends got on the subject of the number of their past lovers. Me and one other are still virgins (she 17, me 34), my buddy (21) admitted to 36, the other girl (21) to 10, and the girl I'm interested in (21) said 40. This info does bother me but I can't seem to be judgmental toward her even though I was raised to see that type of girl as a sl.ut. But no matter what I do I can't kick my overwhelming sense of sensitivity toward her and I just like her. I don't even know if this sort of thing is wrong anymore. I'm confused.

20070623105947AACPeXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does it sound like my friend likes me?	I think one of my female friends might like me, but I'm not sure. This could get a bit sticky because we work together. But here is what she does that leads me to think she might have an interest in me      1. Smiles and tilts her head a little when she talks to me.   2. Her eyes are pretty much locked on me when I'm talking to her and she has a little smile on her face as she listens.   3. She tries to groom me by saying things like "You need to get this type of haircut or I don't like that shirt on you."   4. She throws things at me when my back is turned.   5. She's always asking me to do her little favors like get things for her.   6. When I mention that I'm looking for someone to date, she gets quiet and serious.      I don't know. What do you all think? She's got a boyfriend now so I'm a bit confused as to what she wants. What does this look like to you?

I guess I could see why because I don't really say hello first and I don't talk to him but that is because he intimidates me. It is ironic because I actually really like him and I have a  crush on him, but it won't go anywhere because he is at least 15 years older than me and I am 17. How can I at least show that I respect him and I don't hate him.

20070704083239AAa0Rte	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Going To Newquay... Looking For Advice On: Drinking, Groups And Girls?	I'm 16, and going with 7 people to Newquay, half of which I don't know. I always tend to go quiet (in a group), which makes me often feel left out... I haven't really got drunk either , not gone to parties and all that stuff, whereas most of the others have. Also, I have 2 of my best mates not going and only have 2 mates that I know well going. Also the stronge characters always seem to get people to follow them (i.e. my mates) in what they do, whereas I feel, why should I follow them, I want to play some footy on the beach, not get pissed!      Not really looking forward to it, even though I agreed to go but never realised that I would go with a load of people I don't really know (and have different interests)      I also go to an only boys school and, so don't meet them girls that often. I feel that if I had a one-to-one convo with a girl I would be fine, but with a group I would go quiet.      I know these social confidence qs are asked a lot, but advice would be really appreciated

As I got to know him better, I started liking him more. I started getting signals from him because he would flirt with me. But I didn't think I was the type of girl he went for and sometimes I mistake a little friendliness for more than it really is so I decided to play it cool. Maybe a little too cool. My friend thinks he likes me too but is just being a punk. She says he's probably afraid to come on to me for the same reason I'm afraid to come on to him. I think she's right but I'm not sure.

20070708203037AAo98Xr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Still think I am immature and naive?	I hate how girls my age give me a bad name. I am young. I know this. Most girls my age go around saying, 'Oh, I love this boy.' and then, a few days later, they want nothing to do with him after a bad breakup over nothing. When people talk to me, they never take me seriously. I have a boyfriend whom I have known for nearly three years, and I love him. Not like 'i love him until i find the next hottest thing' or 'i love him until he makes me mad and i break up with him.'  It's not at all like that. I love him because he was nice to me, he was a great friend for a long while. He makes me smile and laugh, he calms me down when I am stressed out, mad, or feeling a little down. He is the sweetest thing ever, and believes it is important I have an opinion, even if he doesn't agree exactly with what I believe. He is who I want to live with for a lonngg time. Hopefully my entire life, because I know I can tell him anything. He helps me through anything.. and I love him. What do you think?

The last month she would always pick a fight with me get her argument across then before I could respond she would hang up the phone on me.  Well then she cheats on me and I ask her why she did it because I wanted to know if it had anything to do with me.  This was her response   "No you were a real nice guy and I enjoyed being with I think if I would of met you eariler or later in my life we would prolly be married.  The reason I did this was because my last boyfriend did the same to me and I felt hurt angry and betrayed.  So I guess I just wanted someone else to feel the same as I went thorough.  Sorry hope you can forgive me and maybe we can still be friends"      I was so pissed I just walked away and said forget it.

My father lives off of women, is known to have beaten women including my mom in the past, cant treat a female, cant keep a job, and cant take care of himself.

This guy is so bad that he was about to get thrown out his house last Saturday before one of his broads handled the situation. WTF should I listen? He's a 49 year old loser. I love him, but it is what it is. Thank god I dont live with him since my mom divorced him when I was 7 (im 17 now).

Well a guy I sponsor joined the Family. He sold for us in the past and still wants to continue. I say no cuz if he comes short on tax I dont want to punish our own. I just want him to enforce tribute. But he insist on selling and doubling up. Should I let him?

20070831204000AAZYBu4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Indifferent???	hi ppl   i think there's something wrong with me! is being indifferent about almost everything a bad thing??? this last summer was horrid for me because i was too old to go to day camp and too young to work. so i didnt do anything and i guess that just made being indifferent worse for me cuz i just kinda dont care about anything except for school, sports, friends, and reading. my friends have never told me that my indifferentness annoys or bugs them, but i care more when im around them so it doesnt matter. i mean my sister is the one who is worried cuz when im at home, i dont care for anything except homework, food, reading, and the computer! and i feel bad cuz she wants me to not be indifferent but its hard! cuz i just dont care about stuff at home! she thought i was depressed over the summer! which i wasnt by the way. what in the world should i do??? i feel like my indifferentness is hurting my sister but i dont want that to happen!

20070817170457AA6kepQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kind of shallow b/f What should I do?	I've been dating my bf for almost 2 yrs now. We care for each other a lot. I'm overweight but my b/f says he doesn't like skinny girls. He likes curvy girls with big boobs like me and tells me all the time how beautiful I am which makes me feel great. Now, although I don't think he's anymore shallow than anyone else in the world (because let's face it, we all have our physical preferences) I was kind of upset by something he said. I asked him "If I looked the same/had the same personality and everything, but I only had one breast, how would you feel?" and he said he would still like me but admitted that he would be weirded it and it would effect our relationship. This makes me really sad because I'd accept him not matter what. He admits that he feels like a jerk but the fact that he feels that way is making me question whether I want to stay with him. But I really love him and he says he loves me and I don't want to let him go, but I admit that I have mixed feelings. What should I do?
20071224221032AA67Z4y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it that?	Why is it that the girl I dated for 1 year and 4 months before we broke up october, would rather be with a guy that smokes pot "occasionally" than me when I don't do those things.  When we first started dating and before we took and break and she met him, she always told me that she would never date someone who does drugs and that if I ever started, she'd ask me to quit, then leave me if i didnt.  Night before last, she called him and he was alone with his ex and she got mad and now it doesnt seem to bother her.  Now thats shes with this guy, her story has apparentley changed.  She used to call me the love of her life and she even was gonna leave him for me one time, but went right back to him.  Its complicated but im going to college in january, 2 1/2 hrs away and she has said her feelings towards me havent changed but she would rather be with him since hes not leaving.  its so confusing.

20070822030235AAtcKmf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Do Men Find Cute About Women ?	My husband-to-be finds everything cute about me except yelling/screaming. He never calls me by my real name; he always has a cute and different name for me. The way I talk, dress, listen, and just act around people make him go crazy. Even when we fight or argue, he tells me I can't even fight or argue right and he'd just laugh off the whole fight. I never know when I am being cute; he lets me know. He complements me on everything. He tells me he loves me probably about 200 times a day. It's not like we just met, we have been together for a few years and this just seems to grow stronger day by day. Is this how every man in love treats his woman or am I just too damn lucky?

Hola! estoy pasando por letra pesada; y sucede que mi novia y yo llevamos más de 8 meses juntos. En principio tengo 25 a?os ella 22. Relataré brevemente que a ella yo la conocí en una boda pero fue su hermana menor la qué más llamo mi atención; Desistí de inmediato con Denisse al conocer su edad (17) me enfoqué solo en Jessica, ya que acorde a mi edad ella tenía una plática más interesante para conmigo…   El punto crucial aquí es qué tuve la desastrosa experiencia de involucrarme con la hermana menor, y las cosas se han dado de tal manera qué se nos ha prestado la oportunidad para vernos a diario por que coincidimos en principio en el gimnasio. La llevo diario todos los días a su casa.   Siento que he defraudado la confianza no solo de mi ya casi ex-novia, sino de mi suegro y suegra que se han portado excelentes conmigo.   Me siento muy mal por que para ser sincero… no siento que Denisse me quiera de verdad como Jess, pienso que esta deslumbrada y que fueron las circunstancias

20070710200415AAm1Dxr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this mean he likes me?	Ive known this guy for 2 years. We've never really talked much but he used to say hey alot and shake my hand when he saw me. (he goes to my church) Anyway, now he rarely says a word to me, he looks at me whenever he gets a chance, and always tries to sit near to me. Other than that its almost like he is avoiding me. Whats going on?

20070711102845AAD84Q3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For the Ladies: Would you date me?	Just out of wonderment.      Im an intelligent guy, in 2nd year engineering. I play tons of sports and am very athletic, and keep in great shape through continuous exercise. I have a great sense of humor, and love love love music. (I play classical, electric and acoustic guitars) I would consider myself a good-looking guy, not on par with some of these ridiculous model-types, but just in general an attractive guy. I also love to cook for whoever may hang around for it, and would also classify myself as a caring, genuine person.      May sound kind of odd, but the reason I ask is that I've been so caught up with studies, and trying to build a future for myself (the family isn't too well off financially) that I have never really given myself a chance in a relationship. I'm just curious as to what women look for in men... bad-asses, rockers, nerds... what?

20070727102450AARBWn0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend...sort of...I need help!?	I met a guy online through a friend last fall. We met in person a few times and the last time I lost my virginity. He moved to Florida, where I'd been planning to move for a while, and everything seemed fine. I wouldn't get to see him for almost 2 years, but we talked. This month, I lost my dad, my grandpa, and my dog all within 2 weeks. After my dad died, this guy(I won't say his name) basically told me that he had enough problems of his own, couldn't solve mine, and didn't want to hear about mine. Then, my grandpa died and a couple hours after I found out, I texted my bf to tell him. He has weird ideals and beliefs, but he told me...and I quote "You should be happy." I said to him, "Know what? **** you!!! 1st my dad, now this?! Go to hell!!!" He got me so thoroughly pissed off that I was ready to kill. And had he been there at the time, he would have ended up in the hosptial, within an inch of his life. But the problem is, as pissed off as I am, I still love him. Help me.

20070731005144AAxHbgO	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I diplomatically say this?	My wife and I live near her parents and about 5 1/2 hours away from mine.  This means that we see her parents anywhere from 1 to 3 times per week.  Her parents are retired and don't have much to do, while mine still work full time.  We recently decided to make the trip to see my parents.  My wife invited her parents to come along.  This has happened in the past.  When it last happened, I know that both my parents felt as though my inlaws were imposing upon their time with their son and daughter-in-law.  They figure that they rarely get to see us and that they would like to spend some good quality time with us.  Fortunately this time around, my inlaws declined the invitation.        How can I tactfully express my concern to my wife and inlaws about my parents feelings without making everyone hate each other?  As of now they are all on good terms and enjoy each others company, but I don't want that to sour.

20070913161848AAqS3zf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal at all?	I like this guy a lot. Well, from what I've seen so far. I haven't really talked to him because he always appears deep in conversation with someone else.   Even so, whenever I think about him, whenever I know I'm about to see him at a certain time at school (I'm 15, keep in mind), I start to feel over-nervous.   I can't stop shaking, my stomach feels like jelly, and I think I'm going to throw up. Is it normal to feel that way about someone you /just/ met? Am I overreacting? Or is it something worse? This has never happened before until I started school with him.

20080328073120AAVGWyg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When a spouse dies, will you always wish you could bring them back, even years later?	I'm asking for a friend who is in love with a widow.  He knows his lover "Allie" loves him very much, and he wants to marry her.  The problem is, she was widowed young and unexpectedly.  He knows the loss ruined her life, and he's insecure about his relationship with her because he thinks in logic only.   Allie is over George's death. She rarely mentions him and only keeps one picture. She never compares Aiden to him.  She's made it clear that Aiden is the one for the rest of her life.   But he believes it's not possible that a widow would not choose to have her husband back unless there was something wrong in the marriage.     He knows that George's death ruined her life, and he can't be convinced that she wouldn't undo the whole thing, ergo, she doesn't truly want Aiden in her life.  By his logic, her ideal life would be with George, not him.  He won't tell Allie how he feels because he knows he would hurt her and he fears she'll tell him he's right.  She's the only woman he's ever...
20080308214320AA2PXXh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it bad to wish i was white?	you see im mixed (black and white) and it sux. see i act more white and get along with white people more than i do with my black side (mainly cuz i was raised by a white mom but no dad) but the things is i tend to crush on white guys first, then mixed boys, then black boys. the prob is i can never be with a white guy cuz everyone knows that white guys do not date mixed girls. i mean there is nothing good about being mixed, at least not that i can think of (i dont even get along with my black side, in fact half of my enemies are black.) so is it bad to wish i was white?
20080707210009AALvhwO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do?

Ive liked him for a while. he use to talk to me alot because our lockers were next to each other, and we would joke around in a class we had together. then i got excited thinking he might like me and i had one of my friends tell him i liked him (i know i shoulda told him my self) and he didnt really talk to me that much anymore. the end of the year we had to do a project together and it was just like old times, but this year it was back to he didnt talk to me that much. but i have caught his gaze for a few seconds a couple times. what do i do i really like him?
20080307145227AA1fMD4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Single mom needs dating advise....?	Its not what you think...I am a 31 year old single mom who lives with my parents.  My mother thinks I should not be dating.  I am finding it hard to go out because she makes me feel guilty about her not getting to do anything with my father, (even when I stay home they don't do anything).  Anyway, I have been single for 6 years now and I feel the need to start looking to share my life with someone.  How do I make her understand that things are not the same as it was when her and my father dated and that just because I am divorced that my life is over as far as dating and relationships go.  I don't want to hurt her feelings and she is hard to really talk to when it is something she does not want to hear.  I need her to understand, and to help me with the kids.  She is the only sitter I have.  What do I do????  Please help!!!!   Thanks in advance......
20080925144301AAFvZZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you consider appropriate?[ladies]?	My girlfriend wants me to dress nicer [more casual than dressy] when we go out and want but she wants to pick out my clothes because I don't dress well [her words]. She says I look nice when I wear my crew neck cardigans and wants me to wear them more often like I do for my job. Whenever I wear a cardigan and slacks, she says the sweater needs to be buttoned up. Whenever I wear the cardigan with jeans and maybe button up half the sweater, she thinks a couple more need to be buttoned. They are 7 button cardigans so halfway buttoned is a judgment call so what would you suggest. She hates when I only button just the top button as well. If I wear the cardigan unbuttoned, she feels it necessary to button it stating that I wanted it buttoned

She's nice, but I can't help but hate her. My last two or three crushes fell for her. I bet you at least 20 guys like her, and recently I've noticed her and my new crush flirting constantly.

I'm sick of losing my crushes to her.      What can I do to get myself noticed?

20080609123622AAznhAy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he pick on me?	I've known this guy that  i work with for about 2 months or so, about a month ago, he's started teasing me. We work together at a fast food resturant, Mcdonalds. He teases me alot, He once put ketchup on me, and when i was sweeping, he threw a tomato on the floor. Yesterday he put hand sanitizer on my shoulder, it sunk through my uniform and my shoulder was cold. He sprayed me with water. He's taller than me so everytime he walks by he pats me on the head. He calls me short sometimes, which i am and hates to be called so.  Im 17 and i think he's about 18 or 19. It's kind of sad though, he's leaving for iraq in about 2 weeks.

20080403020817AAd4MJE	Family & Relationships;Family	Work and taking time off to look after sick kids.?	This week I was called to collect my 3 year old from nursery as she was running a temperature.  I kept her off the following day and then my son who is 11, fell ill as well.  I have been off work 3 days now.  I have kept in contact with my office and instructed the staff as best I could but my boss is going crazy with me and saying things like 'this can't happen again' - as if I had a choice!  My boss has always been fairly unreasonable when it comes to time off and I appreciate the inconvenience to my office but I have offered to do work at home and am available on the phone should anyone need me.  However, my first priority is looking after 2 sick children - I don't feel well myself now but I don't have the luxury of taking time off for myself!  My husband does normally do his share but was unable to help this week.  Last year I was off a total of 8 days for the children which was less than the time I took off when my father died!  Does anyone else get this at work?

20080513074911AAhdclL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I get back together with her or not?	I was with this girl for 2 month. She had a boyfriend for a year and a half before me.   At the last party that we went together, her ex came and she reacted in a weird way. She danced all night with the girls, drank a lot, started to smoke again - I told her that I don't like her when she smokes - and she talked to her ex, started to cry while he said things to her O_o that was really unexpected.   She didn't  talk to me that night and she didn't care what I said to her.I did the same thing and didn't give a damm about her.   The next day, I told her how awful I felt and that I didn't wanted to have to go through that again.   She then told me that she can't make up her mind about me and her ex. I asked her if she is going to be with me from that day on, she said no!.   3 days passed, and now she wants to come back to me. I am 18 and she is 17. I do love her. I do want her. But I can't live with the thought that she loves her ex to. She lied to me about him, she said it was really over HELP PLS

20080609121540AAmRWsl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just convenient for him, or does he really love me?	Okay...my bf seems to be a bit different than he was when we started to date about 4 months ago. We used to go out all the time, to the diner or his place, just to chat and get to know each other.  He was coming off a 2-year engagement at the time he met me, but it had been about 6 mos. since he had dated anyone and swore he was over her. He told me he loved me within a week and treated me like a queen for about 3 months. Now he still says he loves me all the time but is not putting forth the effort to see me.  He blew off our plans all weekend and is not putting the time in to see me again until Friday, although we previously had seen each other at least 2x during the week. He's very self-centered and dominant, but also very sweet, kind, and intelligent.  Sometimes I offer to do things like take a walk after a date, but usually it's "I'm tired" which seems a little lame to me.  I'm noticing a difference in his commitment to me. Have I been played the fool? Am I a convenience?
