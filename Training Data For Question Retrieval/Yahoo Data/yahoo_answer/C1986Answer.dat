Once you get the fax, you can contact the people who sent it and ask them to correct their records.  Hopefully, you have a fax machine in the office.|`|be8d3f8f3ac3b53f0894bb723ebf0fdfaa	Forward your calls to a fax machine. More than likely once the fax is received it will stop.

There are many downloadable games, some are free, some will cost you some dough. All around the iPod touch is a great investment.|`|QRqez2yiaa	I believe it doesnt come with any but there are many free ones I can recomend tap tap revoulution witch is like guitar hero and dance dance revoultion.  also a lot of fight games email for more ill tell u a bunch|`|ftI1Hny8aa	The iPod Touch doesn't come with any games. You can get games at the App Store. Some apps cost money, but not all of them. There are a lot of fun ones that are free, my favorites are Tap Tap Revenge (the game Raptor mentioned), and JellyCar. A lot of the free ones are "Lite" versions of the games that cost money, but IMO the Lite versions are just as good as the Full versions.|`|8cG6OTcsaa	Out of the box doesn't have any, but it's very easy to get some from apples appstore. There are many free ones as well as some paid ones
AbRfd29Haa	If you have a GSM phone, it will.. but how well, it depends. In the USA, T-Mobile and AT&T are GSM. If you have a CDMA phone, you're not going to get coverage outside of North America. Verizon/Alltel and Sprint/Nextel use CDMA (Nextel used to use a system called IDEN, but that has largely been replaced). <br>  <br>  If you're on a CDMA system and travel frequently, you might be able to buy a dual-mode phone. I know Verizon sells CDMA+GSM phones.. they cost more, so they're only sold for those who look for them. Years back, I was on Nextel and had a dual-mode IDEN/GSM phone.. it was drek... it didn't work right on GSM. But I'm sure they've worked the bugs out by now. <br>  <br>  I don't know which carriers are in Canada, but it's easy to tell. If you have a SIM card (not a MicroSD memory card, but a SIM card), you have a GSM phone. The SIM card basically holds your phone ID... you can move this card to another phone and, like magic, your calls now come to that phone (with CDMA, you have to enter the new phone's ID codes into your account). <br>  <br>  So for GSM... in the North America, GSM uses frequencies at 850MHz and 1900MHz... in most other countries other than the Americas, it's on 900MHz and 1800MHz. Most phones sold in North America are tri-band phones.. they'll work outside the Americas, but coverage may be spotty. North American tri-band phones leave out 900MHz, which is the most popular GSM band. 1800MHz is common in cities, but not necessarily outside a city (lower frequencies have fewer channels but more range, so they're popular in the country). <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Australia only has 1800MHz coverage in congested areas. To work well, you'll really need a quad-band phone. <br>  <br>  Then, there's the plan issue. Some carriers automatically enable international coverage, others make you enable it. When I had T-Mobile, I had to enable it.. it didn't cost anything, and I could do it online, but I couldn't do international roaming without it. So you should check. <br>  <br>  Then there's the price... most carriers just soak you for international roaming. When I was in Mexico, it was like nearly a dollar a minute. <br>  <br>  If you have an UNLOCKED GSM phone, you can lower costs significantly by buying a prepaid SIM card when you get to your destination. This changes your number, and you'd have to ask about text services and international charges... but they tend to be cheap. Here's an example:<br>  <a href="http://www.telestial.com/view_product.php?PRODUCT_ID=LSIM-AU02" rel="nofollow">http://www.telestial.com/view_product.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pandasim.com/australia-sim-card.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pandasim.com/australia-sim-ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.simcardguru.co.uk/pay-as-you-go-australia-mobile-phone-sim-card.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simcardguru.co.uk/pay-as-you-...</a><br>  <br>  If you don't have an unlocked GSM quad-band phone, you may be able to unlock your phone, but you might also just buy a cheap unlocked GSM quad-band model. Here's one store that claims to have an unlocked GSM quad-band for under $40:<br>  <a href="http://www.n1wireless.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.n1wireless.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can also check out eBay. And there are companies that rent these. <br>  <br>  Regardless of your own cell service, you can buy that SIM card for Australia and drop it into one of these unlocked phones. In Oz, all incoming calls are free (messages probably not), but that's something to factor into your thinking.|`|pqrfV0vFaa	I would contact your provider before you go to check about the rates of what is called international roaming. Also check for an adapter for the electrical outlets in AU, because they are way different than ours.|`|z88IMXNFaa	It may be very expensive.  Do a google search on the subject.  Many experts recommend renting a phone in your destination country.|`|PEN3hha7aa	i would worry just as much about the charger working with their electrical system.   when i was in italy for a year i had that problem and had to buy adapters to conform to their system or my electrical stuff would have fried.|`|WyWtnigoaa	I suggest you get a local SIM card/Cell Phone from RebelFone for AUS before you leave. Best way to avoid expensive International Roaming:|`|BgwTxzEFaa	It should, buy your going to pay huge roaming fees.|`|yjtvfTBSaa	More than likely it will. I have verizon and I travel alot. Depending on the country you are going to they have different companies to take care of the calls.
qWicVoU9aa	Why don't you let Yahoo! do it for you?  Go in to your inbox for your email on the computer and over to the right hand side you should see a hyperlink that says Mobile Mail, jsut click on that and a box will come up and ask for your country and then your mobile number and after filling them in click the button on the biottom that says "send link" and it will be sent to your phone.

NZmWfZsdaa	Not really. <br>  <br>  The only safe places to download music are itunes or rhapsody (pretty much any place where you pay for the music). You probably find this unfair like many other people do but they are guaranteed safe because there isn't any peer to peer (p2p) exchange like limewire (they can also put the money in to make sure there are no viruses and stuff like that)<br>  <br>  Movies on the other hand is different. <br>  <br>  I know a website that has links to movies. <br>        All these links are not guaranteed to work and can buffer slow and the quality might be sacarficed but you will be able to watch. <br>  Also you can download a free trial of a program named Graboid off the internet (it is only avalabile to Windows users) but it will give you 4000mb of bandwith for free which lets you download around 5 movies, give or take, depending on the mb use of the movie and how new the movie is. For example, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button may be 849mb's while Mean Girls is over 4000. (This program also has tv shows.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have a good day. :)|`|ssoZ33XIaa	music.download.com is a good source for free, legal music downloads.|`|Gj47yTKvaa	pirate bay is a great one for torrent|`|s5a0OqzOaa	There are no free legal ones just more safe ones like torrents and things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also if you do download anything illegally and dont want to get caught download peer guardian.|`|JMNOASSjaa	<a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com/</a> is a safe download site for music.|`|URZeQfQCaa	There are no safe alternatives, but there are some less risky ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My favourites are:<br>  <br>  Torrents<br>  DC++

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	Hope you have a windows computer, here's what i did:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. I rebooted or turned off the ipod a few times since (just to see it was possible), and everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz|`|k0BF9M0Haa	Well luck you! The new jailbreak is now out! ;D<br>  Well from what I've heard anyways, it's been working pretty well...<br>  <br>  The best jailbreak software that I know of right now is from quickpwn.com, if you go to their webisite go to downloads and look for the file name with the ipod touch, filmware, and generation on it.<br>  <br>  Download the software and follow its directions. It's really simple and enjoy!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!
l32X56Moaa	Just so you know: about a month ago, Apple declared Jail breaking illegal. I would still do it but be warned. Also, remember that as soon as you jailbreak your ipod you lose your warranty.|`|k0BF9M0Haa	Well, it really depends on what type of software you use.. and it's hacking your iPod, you think it's safe? Well that's for you to decide.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard of any serious problems that's connected to jailbreaking so far so if you really want to do it then I suggest visiting quickpwn.com and maybe YouTube it for visual aid. :]<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

The only other issue is that it still has water behind the screen.<br>  <br>  If you are patient the ipod could come back to life like  mine did.

I do know that if this will work but if you really wanted the movie you could record it on a video camera. Hook that up into your tv and record it off your tv to a vhs and then transfer to a dvd. Thats more complicated though and i would only do that if you really wanted the rented movie.<br>  <br>  Also, this is usually the method i use just because i find it easier. If you have a video camera in your house you should have a cable called an AV/ RCA (click the link in sources and it will show you a picture of one). You can use this to connect your ipod to the tv to watch your movies or shows. Its really simple HOWEVER it will only work if you have the older ipod generations (usually the one where the headphone jack is on the top.) Such as the 30gb white ipod. This will not work with the touch or iphone you will have to buy the connector cord from apple which of course will cost a little bit. <br>       So if you want to use the generic video camera cable there is a link in the sources. <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope this helped.
6P27whuGaa	The two pages wouldn't make any difference only because when you sell the iPod and the new owner syncs the iPod to his computer, the apps will be completely wiped out, unless they happen to have them also, so I would just sell it for about $210-$220 with the accessories included and it's in good condition.

Easy as Pie.|`|ohq6qrFaaa	I don't think there are alternatives to the Zune software... <br>  <br>  There is the WiFi song renting thing, but that only lasts for 3 days? 24 hours?

jKc7aDCwaa	It's pretty good. There's a lot of additional modes than playing just straight up, obviously. If you're any kind of Tetris junkie, it's a no-brainer, except it'd be nicer for just $10 and not $12. I still kind of prefer the comfort of playing someone head-to-head on DS's, personally. That and for some reason, Tetris never seems as clean as the super old school Tengen style Tetris for the original Nintendo and arcades. <br>  <br>  Back in the days of the original Gameboy, I'd get up into the high teens for levels, so what... like 1800-1900 lines? :/

jxpV13rTaa	to unlock the second badge for the medic character, you need to revive at least 5 people in a match. do this 8 times (you get a ribbon each time you revive 5 people in a match and you need 8 ribbons to unlock the second part of the medic) you must do this in 8 seperate matches as well.|`|l4lYGv41aa	cant combine classes, it when u click on second badge it tells u, i think its like get 10 kills in a row without dying|`|Mm2LSrjsaa	Answers above me are correct in regards to getting the 2 medic abilities. But to combine classes you need to get 8 ribbons relating to the second ability. For example, to use the medic second ability with another class (u have to unlock the second ability with that class too) you have to heal people five times in a match to get a ribbon, and then do that 8 times to get the healing specialist badge. Then you can use the healing ability with another class.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	the person above me is correct.

No problem at all at the airports.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	yes|`|zmrHJAUWaa	Yes, you should be allowed. At the airports they have a little box (relatively the same size as the overhead compartments on aircrafts) by each gate. If you're bag does not fit in the box, you will not have any luck putting your bag in the overhead compartment.<br>  <br>  Security will also not let you bring anything over I believe 8 ounces on the flight, you will have to put in your bag that goes under the air craft.
JaJHDjTLaa	Personal opinion, I don't like touch screens, end of story, they are still an underdeveloped technology.  The Glyde prove this case and point. My roommate owns one and I play with it all the time, I try and push the touch screen with my thumb in the lower right corner, it thinks I'm pushing it in the center of the phone, same with my index finger.  We have re-calibrated it many times and that seems to help a little, but a few hours later it will start doing it again.  The full qwerty keyboard is nice.... if you like that type of thing. I am a HUGE texter, sending roughly 400-500 texts a day, I have owned a Motorola Q also with a full qwerty keyboard and I still prefer T9Word, I am much faster with that than qwerty, but if that's what you prefer then so be it.  The only thing bad I would say about the keyboard is that the top row of buttons is a tad bit hard to hit when texting quickly because of how the phone slides open.  Besides those few complaints that I have about it, all in all it a great phone. We hardly ever lose reception, the sound through the earpiece, and through the speaker phone speakers are both loud and clear, the screen is bright and beautiful, the camera is excellent for a mobile phone, and the menus are nicely set up and presented.  Personally I would not buy this phone because I cannot stand touch screens (one thing I forgot to mention is it is slightly hard to dial numbers and scroll with the touch screen) or qwerty keyboards, but if you like both of those, and you would like a smooth running, sleek looking phone then this is the right phone for you and you will not be disappointed.|`|bX9wMDyVaa	I dont really like the touch screen its to sensitive. I do  like the keyboard>> I would get it its a nice phone to txt on and go on the internet on. I have it but the only other phone that is like better is the blackberry storm and  i also like the voyager so whatever you want to get its your choice.|`|jtEycSCpaa	Yes.|`|aocf35epaa	i have that phone and its horrible.. because it doesn't respond and has a horrible interface.

heFbG2FRaa	I would not buy those 'lenses' but I would advise you to look into buying extension tubes - they are a cheaper alternative to a new lens and allow you to focus at a closer distance than your lens currently allows.

1HtTxOOQaa	First off all, you will have to check if your motherboard has a PCI express slot. It's the slot where the graphics card actually lies. Since your PC has a VRAM of 32MB, I suppose the thing is quiet old (even current day mobiles have more VRAM!!!). So you might have a AGP instead of PCI slot. Get your motherboard checked by a professional and he will tell you if it supports an additional graphic card or not.If the motherboard does not have a PCI slot, then you might have to replace your motherboard. If it does support, then you will have to buy a new card. Recommended companies are NVIDIA and ATI.<br>  <br>  If you want to play current gen games, then a good GPU is recommended. Currently, 512MB VRAM is essential for next gen gaming. There are many variants which start from 100$ and go upto 800-1000$. You will be happy with a card worth somewhere around 200$.<br>  <br>  For gaming purposes, a 512 MB card around 200$ is good, but if you are not going to play games on it, then any card around 256MB VRAM will be sufficient.|`|ykXzzx65aa	if add more by buying a new video card....|`|BMConIedaa	There is no way to add memory to that card.<br>  <br>  The only way to improve your situation is by buying a new video card.  If you have an SiS card, I highly doubt you have a PCI-E-based system.  I'm guessing that it's either AGP-based (but probably slower than 8x), or at the very worst, old-school PCI.<br>  <br>  It all depends on your motherboard, really.|`|3LIzti5maa	i dont think you can add more ram to your card<br>  looks like you will have to buy a new one<br>  make sure you have the right slot in your motherboard before buying<br>  if its an old pc you will probably get the best it can handle second hand for next to nothing|`|hCGR2Yjhaa	I dunno if it would help. I just used the superior Google and saw something similar to your concern.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	You can if it has sockets. You just have to find it. <br>  <br>  Personally I'd just get a new graphics card. You can get PCI and even older AGP cards dirt cheap.

For, say, a college student who is sardined into a dorm room, perhaps it might make a difference.

Invest in another controller and keep one plugged in while you use the other one. Then just swap them out every time you use your machine. Or if you only have one controller and really don't want to buy another one, first of all, get out and get some friends, but otherwise just buy a longer USB cable so you can play and charge at the same time.|`|WFRooU7Maa	You can use any USB to mini-USB connector<br>  to charge a PS3 controller with the PS3|`|HekFanRvaa	NOPE, you can plug it on either PS3 or PC/laptop... that is a waste of money..|`|T3kMYhNbaa	naw b <br>  they gice u a usb and u charge it there dawg|`|aROiy2Gnaa	u need to charge the controllers duh but when u buy ur ps3 there should be a usb cable in the pack and u plug it into the ps3 system and then smaller end into the ps3 controller to charge oor pair it|`|1HtTxOOQaa	How the hell will the thing work if you don't charge it? The PS3 controller unlike the 360 one has a chargeable battery. When you connect the controller via USB to the PS3, the thing charges.

My guess is you have a 18-55 mm lens ... then next logical additional lens would be either the 55-200 mm or if you need a longer lens, the 70-300 mm lens.<br>  <br>  Where did you find such an unusual lens length?  All I could find are some P&S cameras that have 7-70 mm lenses on them that are 35 mm equivilants of 38-380 mm  They are the Canon S1 IS, Sony H3, Kodak ZD-710, Fujifilm S700, Nikon S4 and Olympus SP-500.  All are SLR-Like P&S cameras with 10x, permanently attached zoom lenses.<br>  <br>  DSLR's have interchangeable lenses.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Its unlikely to be a good performer, it will be a slow lens (small maximum aperture) so its a bright day lens, in dim light the auto focus will just 'hunt' uselessly.<br>  <br>  With a zoom range so wide it will have distortions which will vary with focal length, pin cushion at one end and barrel distortion at the other and aberrations anywhere in between, pictures will have limited contrast and appear flat and lacking contrast in anything but the best lighting.<br>  <br>  If these wide range zoom lenses performed well it would be the only lens manufacturers would need to make. <br>  <br>  IMHO don't waste your money, lenses matter more than any other single component with regard to image quality, get the best you can afford. Primes (a single focal length) are best, small range zooms a good second best, wide range zooms forget.<br>  <br>  Chris

AbRfd29Haa	An amplifier is a device that increases the amplitude of a signal. This can be an increase in voltage, current, or both. The amount of change (output level divided by input level) is called the "gain" of the amplifier. <br>  <br>  In analog electronics, many circuit elements work to attenuate a signal.. they lower the signal level. So sometimes, an amplifier is used in a circuit simply to maintain specific signal levels throughout the circuitry. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, amplification is the main goal. For example, an audio amplifier... the signals swapped between audio gear (CD/DVD player, tuner, etc) are fairly low-level... you can't hear them. Somewhere in your audio/video system, there's an amplifier system (actually a series of amplifier stages) that boosts the signal enough to drive a speaker or two. <br>  <br>  Same idea with a wireless device.. a transmitter creates a signal at a fairly low power level, then amplifies it for broadcast. That final signal level says a great deal about how far the broadcast will go.|`|BJERgbM5aa	To amplify =  to make louder;  to make bigger;  to enhance  to an objects characteristics/quality.  So, an amplifier is a tool to perform that function, usually electronically, but not always.  For example, if I connect an electric amplifier to a guitar, the sound made by the guitar will be louder.  I have thus, with the help of the amplifier, amplified the sound.  Another example, if I use a pair of binoculars to view something, that something appears to be larger and/or closer than it actually is.  I have therefore, through the use of a tool (binoculars), amplified my vision.  After I finish this letter and then add more examples of this explanation, I have amplified by answer.  Get it?  If I type this last question in capital letters (GET IT?), I have amplified my question.  ok|`|AA11061397	"An amplifier is a device that increases the amplitude of a signal." <br>  <br>  That is quite correct.  It does that by making a larger copy, or series of copies, of the signal presented to it.  <br>  <br>  If the final result is a good copy of the original then it is said to have little or no distortion.<br>  <br>  The poorer the copy, the higher the distortion.
AbRfd29Haa	You can't use Bluetooth. <br>  <br>  There are dozens of Bluetooth applications, called profiles. Some include user interface, modem, cordless phone, headset, audio headphones, etc. Not all Bluetooth devices have all profiles. Devices that transfer files over Bluetooth need a Bluetooth profile called OBEX.. the PS3 doesn't support this, it's using Bluetooth only for remote controls. <br>  <br>  You can transfer files to the PS3 using its network interface, either WiFi (802.11b/g) or the wired interface (10-Base-T ethernet).<br>  <br>  Maybe easier, if you don't have a wireless network (or have lots and lots of files to transfer), you can put the files on a USB memory stick, then plug that into the PS3 and copy them off. <br>  <br>  Here's a video showing how to actually do this transfer:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_2370274_import-music-using-playstation-3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_2370274_import...</a>|`|ApFh12Sqaa	I dont think the PS3 have Bluetooth transfer capabilities.|`|6XHesUihaa	I honestly don't think you can.|`|CKY0rZUXaa	Connect the laptop via the walkthru here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/bluetooth.html" rel="nofollow">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/...</a><br>  <br>  Then simply browse the files on your PS3 via your laptop!

qWicVoU9aa	Why don't you call Verizon and ask them.  Then you will have a real answer and it will be straight from the horses mouth and not from someone guessing or someone that just gives answers to get points and it might not be the right answer.  Only Verizon can give the best answer to your question.  Read the answer above mine and my point is made.  Obviously that person has no clue what he is talking about because the BlackBerry device is a dual network device and works on both CDMA and GSM and does have a slot for a SIM card.

Sounds like you're connecting with a USB cable to your PC, which means your PC might not be recognizing it as a mass storage device for some reason.

You probably need more back and forth to solve this, I'd recommend a forum like the one below, designed for digital photo frame users.

I've had this TV since very early March. I've watched HD, SD and Blu-Ray and can not find a flaw. The 650 handles motion extremely well to where blurring and other artifacts are virtually non-existent. The AMP is a very cool feature that brings a realism to film making it seem more life-like, or as if it were originally shot on HD Video. Some have said this gives off a "soap opera" effect. I can see that description, but to me it makes film based DVD's and movies look more like your watching a real-life play, viewing it through a window. It's a very cool effect! <br>  <br>  I understand people's concern's with the glossy screens found on plasma and some LCD's. This screen is slightly less reflective than Samsung's 71 series but can still be a problem for some. It would be nice if there was an easy solution for this but there's not. Sony and other makers use a matte type of screen that certainly helps or eliminates the problem but introduces other negatives. I find colors and blacks just don't "pop" on matte screens and tend to wash out more for off-angle viewing. The 650 has a picture with great depth and color from any angle, greatly adding to the immersion effect. <br>  <br>  Much talk has been about the TOC bezel. I think Samsung has hit it out of the park with this. I absolutely love the red. I think it adds just a touch of class. It sets this tv apart from all others(though the picture quality already does this) while still being very subtle and retaining the ability to blend in with any decor. Most people who've come to my home do not even notice the red until I point it out. I'm a little tired of every set looking the same with either a piano black bezel or flat black. This is a very welcome change. <br>  <br>  I like many other suffered the shut-off issue. As has been mentioned it appears Samsung has fixed the issue with a firmware update. I've updated the FW and so far so good. It was annoying but not a huge deal to me. Samsung should be commended for how quickly they addressed the issue. I received several calls from upper level officials that were very concerned with my problem. I've never had this level of service from any other manufacturer. Well done Samsung! A side effect of the FW update is that the AMP processing received a boost. Before the FW update I usually had AMP on low at all times and would occasionally put it on High. Now, I still use it at the low setting most times but will put it on Medium occasionally, and find the High setting a bit much for me. I can put it on High without most of the annoying artifacts people have described the 71 series has, which is nice, nut the actual effect is bit much for me. <br>  <br>  Overall, this is best the LCD on the market. I can't see Sony or any of the other manufactures making a better TV this year. They may match it perhaps, but certainly won't surpass it. For those that were on the fence waiting to buy until the shut-off issue was fixed, your wait is over. Buy with complete confidence and enjoy one of the best TV's out there!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413DF8?ie=UTF8&tag=burtoa-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=B001413DF8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...</a>|`|403b9f9e4c28b14be7a2b7a4b1ea71ecaa	the xbr's are their best series the have all the bells and whistles as well as 120hz.  the new 46" xbr8 is on sale for 300 off on their website and if you work in retail and get certified in their products you can get up to 60% off their pricing.

The only way you an use those videos is to convert them first, that means converting each video using some video converting software like HandBrake (free download).<br>  <br>  The way to get around this is to get some good editing software that will let you add files from your digital camera (mov files) and if you want you can add files from your video camera too and make one movie, add music, transitions and titles, once your project is finished, you choose how to save it and burn it. <br>  I use Pinnacle studio 11 ultimate but there are many comparable programs.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi, here's an easy process for you to follow.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Step 1: Make sure you are connected to the internet, preferably broadband, but dial up will work. (You CANNOT install the game without being on the internet.)<br>  <br>  Step 2: Insert 'Empire: Total War Disc 1' into your CD drive. A message will prompt you to 'install' Steam. After Steam installs, you will need to create a Steam account by following the necessary instructions. Fianlly, Steam will update it's latest version to your PC.  <br>  <br>  Step 3: After this, you will need to go to my computer and select the "Empire: Total War" icon. A screen will appear asking you for your unique "key code", which can be found at the back of the game manual. Afterwards, an "install" option will become available. This may take up to 5 hours depending on the speed of your internet connection - Empire: Total War installs vital files from Steam.<br>  <br>  Step 4: When installation is successful, you still won't be able to play the game..Why? <br>  <br>  You MUST download the latest updates for "Empire: Total War". These are found under the "My Games" section of Steam. It will have a status bar which tells you the percentage it has completed. When you hit 100%, "Empire: Total War" is ready to run.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Steam servers are exceptionally busy and lines can be interrupted regularly. Many people are attempting to 'install' their game just like you, and so *Step: 4* may take several days..<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Need any more help or clarification? Simply post additional details.|`|CT3t80suaa	Empire Total War requires Steam to play it. The activation and multiplayer aspects of the game are completely linked into Steam, no way around that.<br>  <br>  If you bought the DVD, go onto the " My Games" tab in Steam and enter your product code ( codes if you bought the Special Forces edition)<br>  Then put the disk into your DVD drive, and select " uninstall". Then re-enter the disk and select " Reinstall". Its the only way I've found of making Steam copy the information off a disk rather than try to download it.<br>  <br>  There has also been a patch released, which will need downloading ( easiest to do this through Steam itself once the game has installed) The Steam servers are also very, very busy at the moment ( they vastly underestimated demand for this game) so your download will be slow and/or won't run at all. Try letting it download overnight.|`|9pGilakuaa	I've got problem with: unable to load library steam.dll; this thing sucks> I couldn't install steam,so I did some researches and I threw out a few programs from PC to be able install Steam properly.

A7ijvQyDaa	Actually the ddr mat has control coding similar to the gamecube controller. I am not sure if it will work with the life outdoor game but it will work with any game that can be played with a gamecube controller.<br>  <br>  However, most functions of a gamecube (or wii) game cannot be used as there are very limited controls.<br>  <br>  The directional arrows act as the buttons on a control pad (not control stick!) would, as do the a and b buttons. The plus and minus buttons do not seem to correspond to any control on the gamecube controller.<br>  <br>  Wiiware games that require simple controls will be playable using the ddr mat as a controller. It is usually very difficult to play games like this though @_@.<br>  <br>  Naturally, you can also use the gamecube controller to play ddr, using both the control pad and control stick.<br>  <br>  That would be cheating though.|`|IL84cjEdaa	no other games except ddr games will work with the mat

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	While most cameras take video, and some camcorders take photos; to get the best of both, you need both. Have not seen a camera that compares with the video from a camcorder and camcorders can't take good quality photos. Suggest the least expensive Canon Camcorder and the Canon A590IS camera.<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

p1dcw35Qaa	First check the obvious, is it on mute? Raise the volume level, check the wires. If you have it hooked up through hdmi, that will carry sound but if you don't, you should have a red and white wire from the cable box to the tv audio input your using. Make sure the wires are tight. If that still doesn't work, unplug the satellite box for a few minutes and then plug it back in.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	If you are using alkaline batteries or have bad electrical contacts between batteries and camera, you are doing good to get five flash photos .  I accidentally had an Adaptive Lighting option turned on and my camera indicated battery low until that option was turned off. The more programs your camera is running, the heaver the load.<br>  <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a><br>  <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell and RayOVac new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  If batteries are removed more than a few hours, the date/time setting and other set-up information will be lost. If the camera is being stored for a long time, the batteries should be removed and stored properly.<br>   <br>  Carry and dispose of batteries in baggies, blister packs, or other containers to protect ends from short circuit. Batteries explode when short circuited. NiMH batteries are environmentally friendly and may be discarded with trash.<br>   <br>  Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.<br>   <br>  Digital cameras require lots of power. Bad electrical contacts can cause lots of problems so battery and camera contacts must be cleaned properly.  Batteries may be fully charged, but camera will indicate "low" if contacts are not really good. The LCD screen is a low steady load, but when lens extension, optical zoom, focus, and flash charging are added in the capture mode; the load is very heavy.  Bad contacts make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out. <br>   <br>  NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries or allow voltage below one volt.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old.<br>   <br>  Click source link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.<br>   <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|AqKALUItaa	The only environmentally responsible batteries to use are either lithium, if you don't mind the cost, or rechargeable Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH).|`|OIdXanGXaa	I definitely recommend Energizer rechargeable AA batteries.

AA10326440	The first time the trackball broke had it been over 1 year since your originally purchased the phone from AT&T? If not, you should not have had to sign any contract, they should've provided you with a new phone based on the manufacturers 1 year warranty.<br>  <br>  The buttons on the front of my daughters phone keeps locking & sticking.  Got the phone on 04/30/08 at full retail price (ouch), turned it in for a replacement of the same phone on 08/31/08, and it started up again a few weeks ago, went back to cell company they played with it and gave me this BS that they couldn't just give me a new phone without recreating the problems.  I told them to check her friends cell records and they'll see she's had at least 5 replacements, I even showed them my original receipt & the replacement receipt. Well they did give us a new one but it had to be shipped as they didn't have it in their inventory.  But all this is less than 1 year from the original purchase date.  My thing was, if they weren't going to help me again, I was going to contact the manufacturer and have them replace it since it's still within the manufacturers warranty.<br>  <br>  So, if indeed the 1st time this happened it was within that 1 year period, I can honestly say that AT&T ripped you off and with that you "MIGHT" be able to force the issue with them to not pay the early termination fee.  But make sure you have your paper work and ducks in a row.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I have a Pentax ME F with a jammed shutter (fixed that) but now the shutter "auto releases" - I was told that this would be about $120 - $150 to repair. YOu should go to the link (on this page) to "Camera Articles" and read the article entitled "Pentax ME Super ramblings" by Henry Taber. It isn't the exact same model as the one you have, but I think the troubleshooting is pretty much the same for all three models (ME, ME F, and ME super). <br>  Good Luck!
771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	Ok ur quite correct it isnt a fault with ur card or adapter. All thats happened is that the card doesnet auto run. To get round this go to my computer on ur laptop and look at the list of extra drives avaialble. U shud see ur hard drve  C: and then ur CD drive and after that there may be another. that might be labeld E:. dble click E:\ and that shud be ur memory card. if it is then click back and drag the icon onto ur desktop. This will make a shortcut for u to use from the desktop direct in the future. now u shud be able to transfer files easily. Hope this helps

6GIrW5eWaa	I have the X3 and the battery life is about 1 month. I always know when it's time to change the batteries when the people I am playing with say that they can't hear me or that I am breaking up. There is also a small amount of static in the headset when it it time to change. I got mine for Christmas last year so to date I have replaced the batteries twice. I find that having the wireless is so much nicer than being tied to the wire. There is still a wire that connects the headset to the xbox controller but if you are already use to that it's just like a normal headset so to me that wire was already there. I like/love my headset it has allowed me to hear things that I normally would not be hearing in the game especially in the multiplayer areas. Good Luck.|`|cqGJgJugaa	Turtle Beach - Ear Force X1 Headset for  Xbox 360  has a long wire so you can reach a pretty good ways

jALife8Faa	It all depends on what your going to allow the "Brat" to do with it ;)  The older PSP fats (1001) versions allow you to hack it easily to play custom applications on it.  This is not recommended.  On ebay you will probably see alot of them.  The new Slim versions let you do more right out of the box- like connect it to a tv, use Skype, and it's much lighter.  I wouldn't buy a PSP that has Custom Firmware on it from ebay- as there could be problems and it can "Brick" (Die) easily.  Need more info- visit my forum- link below :D|`|XfTJDY5Xaa	well there are only two models of the PSP to my knowledge. i do notice that you put "lites" in there. just to clarify that there is a DS LITE which is made by NINTENDO. a different console then the PSP which is made by SONY. It would very depend on the "brat's" age. with younger children i would usually suggest the NINTENDO DS LITE. especially if it is a girl. cheaper and more durable. On the other hand if you are looking around the 15 year old range i would go with the SONY PSP. there are different models and the only difference is the color of the actual console and the contents that make up the screen. the newer model is more scratch resistant and reflects UV rays so the game can actually be played in higher levels of light such as outdoors. I would suggest going to SONY (<a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Features)" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Featur...</a> and NINTENDO (www.nintendo.com )website and check that it has the features that YOU want and not the features that someone else likes that might be trying to sell you that product.

IY9JolQ4aa	Ok whoever the fuckasses that are saying that they dub over don't know **** about broadcasting/film. Get a life and don't even think for 4 seconds you know what you're talking about. They use a shotgun mic on a boom that is held over the speakers. This kind of mic only pics up sound that is directly in front of it so depending on where you point it, it will pick up the sound you want. (of course with a little background nose)<br>  <br>  P.S. There is no sound dubbing ever. That is moronic, and no one has time or energy to sit  down and re-record voice overs. Sheesh.|`|9mTctb7jaa	motion picture film is always shot silent, no mics go to the camera. in a sound stage, the dialog can be spoken and recorded on audio recorders that have time code that coordinates with the film camera. (or the "clapper" in the really old days). Clip on mics are rarely used because they are too visible, normally an overhead boom carries a highly directional mic that is pointed remotely by the boom operator. Because the shots are pre-planned, the boom operator knows how close he can get without being caught by the camera. The room "tone" or natural background sound is always dubbed in later, and the special sounds, like walking, doors closing etc is performed and recorded afterwards on a Foley stage.  The same pretty much for outdoor shooting except the "tone" audio is played a little higher, and the conversations are nearly always added later in an "over-dubbing" studio. Sometimes these conversations are actually spoken by dubbing specialists rather than the original actor as not all actors are sufficiently skillful to do this.  Adding the dialog later makes the final film editing much easier and allows for production of foreign language versions without sub-titles. <br>  <br>  This is how movies are made. Now shooting to videotape is sometimes done differently to take advantage of the multiple audio tracks available on broadcast videotape. The tone and Foley is still added later, so 2 tracks are usually reserved for that purpose.  The dialog normally recorded live through a mic mixer, both boom and lav mics are used. The music bed normally goes on the 4th audio track.|`|mcehFtY0aa	They dub it in. <br>  They pile into a recording studio and read the words while watching their lips move on tape.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Normally, they use special microphones that hang just out of the camera's viewing range.  They are designed to minimize background noise and maximize the voices closest to them.  Also, sound editors go in afterwards and adjust the volume of the background vs. the actors' speech. <br>  <br>  I'm sure some voice dubbing is done in certain situations, but it's unrealistic to do it for the whole episode.  You'd have to pay the actors twice and they are one of the most expensive production costs.|`|vuDE5TPbaa	They will either have the actors wear a microphone or will use one of a pole and hold it over their heads while they film. (the microphone is just above the shot)<br>  <br>  They wouldnt have it dubbed. I repeat, they do not have the actors go over what they said again. It never happens.|`|SToOdHj1aa	They go back and do voice overs.  They have the actors re-record their lines to the video.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	they clip on wireless mics and which are  directional to their mouths. Very effective.|`|6bdfee1eacbc3558c6496c4875ee0f69aa	Look up "looping"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_dialogue_replacement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_d...</a>|`|2lakZBgiaa	its microphones, kinda like a bluetooth, but hidden, and its connected to the camera so it enhances the actors voice volume|`|TAGC3FNOaa	or, they record it separately at a studio, and dub it over.|`|NdhFM3l0aa	dim the surrounding coversations|`|651x6VVeaa	they have loads of special microphones called "booms" all around the space they are performing. it would be very hard to dub a whole show over|`|QiYYcUMVaa	yes, that's very common.  otherwise a boom mic (a mic on a stick held over their heads) helps pick up the conversation.

AA11141136	Maybe he should try a direct connection to the box  and TV, cutting out all the complications, to see if it works properly that way. Then you will know if it is a signal problem, or the additional cabling.|`|snn65YoMaa	If you are using a satellite recorder, you dish must have a dual LNB (bit on the arm of the dish) and two separate cables to the receiver box. Also you must use the correct grade of cable throughout, preferably with no joins in it. You can't use cable splitters to join one cable to the two inputs on the box. The aim of the dish is critical too, but even if this is correct, without the correct cables and LNB, it just won't work.

They tend to be rather decent all-round cameras, have still point and shoot capability, and 75-85% of the capabilities of a dSLR, and you don't need to worry about needing extra lenses, battery grip, speedlites, etc. Recommend something like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-SX10-Digital-Camera/dp/B001FWYT9U/ref=pd_sxp_grid_i_2_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-...</a><br>  <br>  If you do choose to get a dSLR, I have heard the Canon 50D gives less quality than the 40D, because they have too many megapixels, and it picks up too much noise.<br>  <br>  Remember that your lens will be more important than the number of megapixels. Generally German and Japanese lenses are reliable.<br>  <br>  Finally you will always want/need another little bit of kit, a speedlight, another lens, etc.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|HX6JjCTyaa	For your list Canon 50D is the best one and another great model is Nikon D300 or Nikon D90|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I upgraded from a D80 which I had for more than 1 year. The D80 is a very good camera, and the D300 is a significant upgrade. What I like most about the camera is that the D300 has the ability to shoot with vivid colors while at the same time keeping a natural appearance. This leads to images looking better than what they looked like in real life. <br>  <br>  The exposure of the camera is excellent as well. Rarely does it under or overexpose an image. Autofocus is both quick and accurate. It really makes taking high-quality pictures easy. I spend almost no time having to fix the image in Photoshop. <br>  <br>  While the high ISO performance is significantly improved from the aforementioned D80, noise still can show up in poor lighting around ISO 1600 and above. I sometimes shoot ice hockey and can find it difficult to get satisfactory shots if the rink's lighting is poor even while using a 2..8 70-200mm VR zoom wide open at 2.8. That is , however, the only venue where I have had any difficulties. Otherwise it is 10's across the board. <br>  <br>  If I were a betting man, I would imagine that Nikon will come out with a direct upgrade to the D80 (D90?) in the near future. If I didn't want the 6 fps of the D300, I might be inclined to wait. <br>  <br>  In summary, I am very satisfied with the D300 and imagine that I will not be getting any new camera bodies any time soon. The only areas that I can see for significant improvement is high ISO performance and wide-angle photography. I am not into wide angles, and the ISO weakness appears only under the most extreme of conditions. <br>  <br>  Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens<br>  Price: $2,179.93 free shipping<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-12-3MP-Digital-18-200mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B000VR5YA8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235749597&sr=8-2&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-12-3MP-Digit...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that help.|`|c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera.

Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.

The cheapest it is sold for is $150 at Best Buy for a "refreshed" device, but again that is with a 2 year contract with AT&T|`|6aWDgtPqaa	this would be ilegal unless you finished the att contract or you just dont care about it and are still paying the att contract while on tmobile thats fine on the contrary tmobile wont activate it for it is ilegal without having finished or still being on the contract with att (otherwise you stole it which they wont activate it either)|`|oYGtkVwOaa	no way could u get a jailbreak iphone for less then 120.<br>  what i did was i kept my tmobile acount then just got the iphone form at&t.  but even the 8 gig costs over 250.<br>  i would check craigslist for a iphone but the only one u can afford for 120 is a broken one.

JnNlD0dFaa	The restore button makes your iPod go back to its factory setting, which, unfortunately does mean wiping out all your information- songs, apps, and e-mail contacts. Everything. If you have the info in another place and can easily, upload it again, this may or may not work for your iPod. Most likely it will. The good thing is that you can sync it back with your iTunes library.

I recommend you give them your real one because this is easier for verification. If you give them your spam one you might accidentally delete it. The site doesn't spam you its all the offers you will be doing that send the junk email.<br>  <br>  They also ask for your address.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	The US is region 1 for DVD's and players.  The UK is region 2.  Most players will only play a disc with the region they are assigned so a region 1 DVD will probably not work in a region 2 player.  If it plays, it might be a black & white picture.  The US uses ATSC and NTSC TV formats.  The UK uses PAL.  The color information is in different places and at different reference frequencies between the 2 formats and one format won't be able to get the color information from the other format.  You could try it and see.  Maybe borrow a region 1 DVD from somebody and see if it works.  Some DVD players can be hacked to change the region code so they will play other regions.  The links below lead to sites that give hacks for some players.|`|f4d1b694bbe5d754965c49f945a6756daa	No, I'm afraid not. You can buy multiregion players. I got a Coby, mainly for the 5.1 sound for 99 USD here, and it had an option to play DVDs that are not region 1. <br>  <br>  The best bet is to check on the site you are searching for one that is rated as Region 2 or Region 0.

CKRfaRYvaa	If you are going to use your current phone and keep your same phone number, then no, you cannot activate with Pageplus before your contract is over with Verizon Wireless.  The reason for this is that as soon as Verizon Wireless releases the phone number to Pageplus it cancels your account.  However, if you're getting a new phone number then there is no reason why you can't activate with Pageplus now.  You'll just be paying for both accounts until you actually cancel the Verizon Wireless account.<br>  <br>  **Edit**<br>  <br>  Yes, that's doable, and that's what I would recommend.

Transfer of Service is the procedure to change ownership and financial responsibility of wireless service from one subscriber to another subscriber. <br>    <br>  The service is moved to an account with the new owner's name and credit information, and they assume liability for the account/contract. <br>    <br>  The owner of the account can start the process online by logging into myWireless Account. Required information to start the transfer online includes the new subscriber's name, address and email address. Once it is determined the account is eligible, an email will be sent to the new subscriber requesting them to contact Customer Care at the number provided in the email, to accept the transfer. <br>  <br>  To initiate a Transfer of Service (TOS) online you will need to login to your myWireless Account. <br>  Select Support located on the orange bar at the top of the page.<br>  Select the More Phone Support link located in the Phone/Device section near the top of the page.<br>  Select the Transfer of Service link located in the Most Popular box at the bottom of the Phone/Device page.<br>  Follow the instructions on the Transfer of Service Request page to complete the form.<br>  Read the Transfer of Liability information; if you agree select Accept & Check Eligibility.<br>  You will be presented with a confirmation page and an e-mail will be sent to your e-mail address on file. <br>    <br>  Note:  This authorization only remains active for 60 days from the time the transfer is initiated. After 60 days, the authorization will become inactive. Please be sure to remind the recipient of your account to acknowledge and complete the transfer of service as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  The receiving consumer account holder (the person taking over the account) must adhere to the following requirements: <br>  Must be at least 18 years of age: <br>  Exception: Alabama - 19 years of age  <br>  Exception: Puerto Rico - 21 years of age<br>  A credit evaluation is required. <br>  An 11 month contract from the date of the transfer must be accepted.  <br>  An $18.00 Transfer of Service Fee (per line) will be assessed. <br>  A current rate plan must be selected. Expired rate plans are not eligible for transfer.

Totally over rated!<br>  My sister has one, spent hours in line for it and spent crazy cash for it and she hates it.  AT&T charges you an extra $20 a month just to have the data plan.  That's not the bad part.  The bad part is, its sucky when you're trying to text people.  Since it's touch screen you end up hitting all the other letters.  Also, if you're a text junkie like me and like to just slang or short sentencing, the iPhone has a spell checker built in that you can not turn off.  So what ends up happening is for every misspelled word, it will automatically change it for you which potentially means the person on the receiving end will have a totally screwed up message that they'll be trying to decipher what the heck you're trying to say or for every misspelled word you will have to then go back over and spell it the way you want.<br>  Totally sucks!<br>  Blackberrys are the way to go!!!<br>  Hope that helps!|`|aqvQLsMMaa	No. Bluetooth Rubbish, iPod Rubbish, Not Evenn Got Simplee Functions <br>   <br>  DONT GET IT!!,, CRAP BATTERY LIFEE..

The batteries I was using were also rechargeables. <br>  Turned out, the batteries were extremely old, so they didn't hold their charge for too long.<br>  After that, I also got a different camera that uses a rechargeable pack - because its so much easier!<br>  <br>  gl|`|FTs2py0kaa	i use the lithium they work.if they don't ..there is somethin wrong with the camera...............I have the same camera.......|`|p6BXHhxnaa	No doubt your camera has live-view, which displays an image on the screen constantly.  Have you been using your flash?  How about a burst of 100 or so images?  Shooting a movie?  All of these things can deplete your battery power faster than any normal camera use would.  <br>  <br>  If it's not one of the issues above, you should maybe consult your owner's manual, check into servicing the camera, or perhaps look into some high-end rechargeable batteries.|`|99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	The Z is notorious for chewing up batteries, but your experience is not normal to say the least. I would imagine that your batteries are OLD and they no longer hold a charge. If they are a cheap imitation, then you likely will get 150-200 or so charge cycles. Original Kodak OEM (genuine) batteries will get 400+ charge cycles.  The behaviour you articulate sounds like the battery is no longer working under load.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Don't use flash unless you absolutely need it and turn off the screen when you aren't using it.|`|c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	check to ensure that the batteries are NIMH and not NiCad.

dE6e0G6laa	If I understand your question, you are wiring your Xbox to your laptop which is running wireless internet.  This alone is not a good idea just due to latency issues on your speed.  However if you must, you need a crossover cable running from your laptop to your xbox.  This IS NOT an ethernet cord.  After you have that wired you will need to bridge your wireless and ethernet ports in your network connections settings.  After that you will need to change your network connections from "this computer connects to the internet through a router or gateway" to "this computer connects to the internet and other computers connect from it"  These aren't exact phrases but when you're changing the settings you'll see what I mean.

It is a great camera and a very well known brand too. Personally the ultimate camera of all is the canon. I could NEVER have a better camera. And I got mine for about 200-300 dollars at Fry's.

My friend got a 360 for christmas, than 12 days later he got the RROD and shipped  it and got it back 70 days later. My other friend got the RROD 3 days after he got his for his b-day. I think it was june 9th. Well he shipped it June 12th, than may 28th he got it back. It still took a 1month and a half, but isn't it better than 7-9 months!!!!|`|cqGJgJugaa	if you send you xbox 360 in it takes 2-4 weeks to get it back|`|QAKNeENwaa	Sadly, 360s sent to Microsoft take a long time to return. What I recommend is buying them from Gamestop or another store which has a 1 year return warranty. I bought mine from gamestop, and their 1 year non-renewable warranty lets you trade in the 360 when it breaks for a brand new one. All you have to do is package everything that came in the box, and bring it in. It's a good deal, because it's a matter of how long it takes you to get to the store versus months, and 1 year is plenty of time for a 360 to break in.
nQ7G1nBVaa	You need a tuner card that has NTSC in, ans set to channel 3 or A/V in (using A/V from the cable box). You change boxes on the cable box with the remote. The cable box will not output QAM, only analog RF or A/V.<br>  <br>   I am sure the 950Q has the inputs you need.<br>  <br>  Using the tuner directly on cable, you can only get analog and unencrypted digital channels.
UinOWcMUaa	You need both red and white audio cables for sound not just white !! Or you can use componet cables, fiber optic cable, digital coax, or HDMI...all  which can be used for sound !!<br>  <br>  However, red and white audio cables are needed for your sound. Looks like you ansered your own question :)

bU9Iy8Gvaa	In the small town in Central America known as Santa Cabeza (not sure if they ever gave it a country), scientists were trying to figure out a better way to mass produce cattle. If they could keep the meat fresher longer, it would help to raise larger numbers of cattle and thus beef production would increase.<br>  <br>  A parasitic wasp was the key. By extracting venom, scientists hoped to preserve the meat. They injected it into live cows... and ended up with zombie cattle. That spread to people.<br>  <br>  The government, in response, wiped out the entire village of Santa Cabeza and denied any knowledge of what had happened there. They blamed it on the drug war.<br>  <br>  Carlito and Isabela, brother and sister, knew what'd happened there. Isabela had actually worked in Santa Cabeza and had seen what had happened with her own eyes. That's why she went along with Carlito's plan to use the wasp venom to trigger new zombie outbreaks... so that the government could no longer deny its happening, and so that Carlito and Isabela could feel avenged for what had happened to their village. Willamette, Colorado was one of Carlito's targets... and it's the one with the first zombie outbreak.<br>  <br>  Carlito was on board entirely as it was his idea. Isabela was reluctantly willing, and that changes, as the story goes on.<br>  <br>  There's your background story. =)|`|yvtGL6RTaa	bee's...that has something to do with it..i think the bee migrated from the place where the original infection took place and carried the virus all the way to that town withthe mall...im pretty sure thats it...its been a long time since i played/beat it|`|awU09Z8qaa	the infection started with a bee or fly of some sort whatever. if you got this far  a cut scene when frank was in the warehouse he found the bee or fly of some sort lol and killed which killed zombies around him.<br>  so maybe the fly bit one then the zombie bit another lol|`|dZJZE4Wqaa	the indian guy i forget his name but him and the doctor put the parasite in the bee's and then the indian guy took it to the town where it is happening.thats how it happened sorry im not any good with the names i had to trade my copy in to get my new 360 cuz my old one had the ring of death.|`|CAxn8v1Aaa	I think a zombie like came out of a diffrent town (city, country, I dont know) and it bit someone and they bit other people and you just have to kill them|`|WVVCt2rcaa	I do not know the story but i do know that it was a movie

AbRfd29Haa	Your HDC-HS9 has several video modes... be sure you are setting the correct one. It supports both 1920x1080/50i and 1920x1080/25p... so sure, it's quite possible you have been recording interlaced. Also, the HDV-like mode, 1440x1920/50i, is always interlaced. <br>  <br>  If you're seeing true field to field motion, "mice teeth", etc.  in a single frame, you are definitely shooing in interlaced mode. Here's a bit about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.dvcreators.net/interlacing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvcreators.net/interlacing/</a><br>  <br>  Of course, if your output target is also an interlaced display (TV, Blu-Ray, DVD, etc), there won't be any problem using the 1080/50i video. You'll also lose most if not all of the interlacing effect if you're downsizing from HD to SD or web formats. I have done many shoots in 1080/60i, made great Blu-Ray and DVD from this, and also online stuff that looks fine. <br>  <br>  Here's a review of the HS9, which also shows how to turn the progressive mode on and off... it's a separate function from setting the resolution. <br>  <a href="http://www.simplydv.co.uk/reviews/camcorders/panasonic/avchd/panasonic-hdc-hs9-review.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplydv.co.uk/reviews/camcor...</a>|`|TaxYLHbMaa	the monitor might be the problem here , or you will have to interlace using your editing software , there will be a function as you save the file in the settings under custom settings , this is usually used to make the file size smaller , and is probably an out dated function considering that tv and media which is used for the end products from high definition.<br>  I would expect the software which makes the video looks interlaced if the software didn't cause this is divx , divx have recently included an update that will permit the lines and make the edn product interlace free

AbRfd29Haa	This is normal, to an extent. <br>  <br>  The PS3 has a temperature sensor that's used to determine how much cooling it needs. As it heats up (which it always will, during use), the fan will drive harder to keep the system cool -- the result is increased noise. <br>  <br>  You can minimize this by making sure that the system is in the open and clear of obstructions. The built-in fan is all you ever need to keep you PS3 cool enough, but it's only effective is can work as intended. Enclosing the PS3 in a cabinet, or blocking airflow, can cause unusual amounts of heat buildup. This can result in the fan running louder than it might otherwise, or even overheating (if the games lock up, you're overheating).|`|G0wGbdENaa	as long as you have not done the fan test, neither have you the ps3 the wrong way up, like with the fan facing down or the vents facing down, <br>  <br>  u might just have a less well venilated room|`|c231bbpTaa	Sometimes my ps3 does that as well. It's just it's way of cooling the system down. If you game is not freezing and there is no problems, then I wouldn't worry about it too much. But if you want you could try cleaning the dust out of it.|`|EVFbElUYaa	It's the same as a pc or xbox and laptop.  They built in fans to cool the hard drive.  It only starts after 20 minutes because that is when it has reached the temperature when it needs to be cooled down.  Dont worry.

caTPi1e0aa	if its a serious scratch i guess you can't do anything about it and you'll have to buy a new one. but if its a minor scratch you can take it to GAME and they might be able to repair it.<br>  <br>  thats why i have a ps3 :)|`|zmyZ9BgZaa	Buy a new one. Unless you have something that sands the one very thin layer of disc off with the scratch on it, you must buy a new one. What happened was the lens to read the disc made contact with the disc and just scratched it the whole way around. When that happened to me, I called companies to get a new one, to no avail. You will just have to buy a new one. And fo future reference, don't move your Xbox 360 with a disc in it, even if it's turned off, it still may scratch.

USbIlGYvaa	unlock it in what way. You mean the phone is locked and needs a passcode? That would be the last 4 digits of your phone number. If you mean to use another provider with it you can't
Te9odBWCaa	I love the camera. The pictures are clear, and the features are great. You can resize, crop, rotate, and add color effects to the picture. The video is weird, though it is still pretty cool also. I had this phone for a long time (someone broke it on purpose, so it had nothing to do with something being wrong with the phone) and it was amazing.|`|hi1eqrXwaa	yea i would say it's a pretty good camera. i think it's 10 megapixels..so that says a lot. as for the video, not really good..but it's worth getting the phone..
