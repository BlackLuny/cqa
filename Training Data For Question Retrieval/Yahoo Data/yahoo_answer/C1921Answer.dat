980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Yes you can. You have to drag and drop the songs.|`|UF9MVdSXaa	Yes you can.    Okay so, after you have downloaded the song(s) you have wanted. Hook up your MP3 Player to your computer. Next open up Windows Media Player, and drag the songs from Lime Wire to Windows Media Player (it takes a few minutes). After dragging all of the songs to Windows Media Player, Click the little Sync button, and your good to go!     But if I were you I'd download music the legal way!      To put songs from Lime Wire to your iPod drag the songs from Lime Wire to iTunes, drop it into your library, you Sync it and your good to go!|`|dr9y4tJsaa	yes. If you have an ipod or a zune you have to put all the music you download from limewire into a separate folder and insert in into your MP3.   If you have a zune go to device, then settings, then add folder. If you have itunes go to file and add folder. for any other mp3 you prbly have to go to the settings and add the folder. beware: limeware can put viruses on your computer so be careful about what you download. hope this helps|`|1fV8VZjLaa	yes just buy it then hook ur mp3 up and copy it on there|`|h6H4oP4Faa	idk but you should defenitly do frostwire its soo simple and fast and nice  quality in songs!|`|CeTTTEfFaa	not directly but you can put the downloads into itunes and put it onto the MP3 from there|`|zifxY45waa	You can,. why not:-)....    If you do not mind to be on the verge of illegality:-) (aka piracy).    Just go and type the name of desired song into a "music" field on search page of limewire. Then click on the song in the search result list... Download it onto a computer,..  Plug in your mp3 player and in windows explorer move the mp3 file you've just downloaded onto the icon of the player.   If you have iPod - this move will not work (it will with EVERY other player), you gotta open iTunes. go to menu - file - add file into library - navigate to where you stored the downloaded mp3 file... import it into iTunes library and then copy it on your iPod.     Have fun, good luck    Johnny|`|Dd6KcpjEaa	yes and what you do is download the song(s) to limewire and open windows media go to sync tab the from the library on limewire drag the song(s) over to windows media plug your MP3 player into the USB port and when it comes up in windows media hit sync and your done|`|69xuw29Baa	yes. you can download it the same you can download music on your ipod. First , download songs off limewire(the ones you want), then go to itunes, link your mp3 to it. Step 3: go to files on the top of the itunes page, then click add folder to library. Step 4: Search for Limewire and click it, then click "saved". Your downloaded music from limewire will go to itunes, then you can download the music from itunes straight to your mp3.

937e2e59b70bd2d72ef38a3a0c6b95adaa	Ok.. so it sounds like you have a wired network.. WEP is for wireless so don't worry about that..    Connect the WAN port on your router to the modem with an ethernet cable.. connect both the computer and and Xbox with ethernet cables to LAN ports on your router..    On your router settings set the WAN settings to automatic and make sure DHCP is enabled.. set both the computer and Xbox network settings to automatic.. with this configuration you don't need ICS so undo whatever you set up to do that..    Turn everything off and trun them back on starting with the modem then router then computer and Xbox.. wait about 30 seconds between each device..  The modem should set the router's IP and the router should set it for both the computer and the Xbox..    That should do it.. one other thing.. if your router has a setting called UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) you should enable it.. it will help your Xbox connect to Xbox Live better..    I'll check back later so if you update your question with any more information I can update my answer too..    >>> UPDATE    Usually routers have one port which is a different color and may say WAN next to it.. the other ports will be the same color and say LAN..   What is the model number from your router?  I can look up the manual and give you more specific information..    So you have two devices?  one internet modem and one router?  how many ethernet ports does each of them have?  If you have only one device does it have multiple ethernet ports?  if you have only one device (the internet modem) and it has only one ethernet port you may have to purchase a router to get things to work right..  sorry for the confusion.. let me know what the brand and model numbers are for your device(s) and I'll try to help more..    Good Luck..|`|D9D8Ezybaa	ahh i hate that, umm u should go to ur router settings on ur comp, and check the ips it has there, and then just modify the last number slightly, like just start with the one it says, then up one, and so on, thats what i did and i got it workin|`|AA12146249	I had the same problem you need to call Microsoft 800-4my-xbox. they will help you trouble shoot and you will we playing in no time.. you are on your PC so your internet is fine.|`|YdZcJSBbaa	Call your internet provider ( IP ) and ask them what you need for it, trust me they can tell you.|`|XaRBewgXaa	i once had this problem, what i did is i reinstalled my internet with the xbox off, and then when it was reinstalled i restarted the modem. you dont have to change the ip address, you just have to make it recognizable to the Xbox.

NswJTwskaa	copy the files from the internal hard drive to the external hard drive then re add them to itunes, itunes will just set up links to that hard drive it  doesn't actually keep a file in the old hard drive|`|rvMxaNAraa	Well you simply plug the External HD to the PC via the USB port and the HD will appear as an HD in the my computer icon. At that point the HD is accessible and you can Copy or Cute the files you want and then paste them in the new HD. External HDs are not simply that 'syncs' it just extra space the keep files. You can add and remove files whenever you want. I myself have all my mp4 files on an external 500 gb HD.

There is nothing like it on the web today    and you can make animations and graphics            or     follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.

1vZ1n0agaa	no, free downloadable music is almost never legal unless you're using a free trial for a program (such as rhapsody, but the way to actually download music from there is tricky) orr you're getting it directly from the artist. there are some exceptions, im sure, but i cant think of them    that said, everyone and i mean everyone downloads illegal music (at least once) and it is impossible to get caught unless you use limewire in a college dorm or some other program like that because the computer is connected to some system in the school.    i personally do not feel guilty downloading illegally because i only rip off artists who make a kajillion dollars and i go to concerts + i buy vinyl|`|M1ZNk8Vhaa	No it's not legal you should read terms of service, or privacy policy!

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Probably not. The last 7.1MP camera that Canon released, was the A470, released around 1 year ago and is their lowest end, budget model which costs less than US$100 to buy. Even though it's a budget model, the A470 captures very good quality images (not in lower light, though). However, it's lack of...or lower features, is where it suffers.    So, you should find out which printer it is and whether it's REALLY worth over US$300 to buy.    If your friend can do without the printer, then buying a camera only might be a better option. Don't forget that consumables such as ink and photo paper can be expensive...and often it's cheaper to get them printed by a photo lab, online print service etc.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	Check and see mainly the camera....what price is it selling say on line. Then go from there. Check price of printer's model number by itself. Do not jump into anything. You need a guage to compare.

Enter your zip code to get a list of stores that sell Promaster brand in your area. Look for ones that say they carry 35mm cameras. The nice thing about this brand is that the stores that sell them are usually real camera stores with employees who are knowledgable.    I'm guessing you'll find them priced between $150-$250 which usually includes a lens.|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	Get a used Nikon FM2 or a Pentax K1000. Both these cameras come as a kit with standard 50mm lens and are easy to find used. Try ebay, craigslist or shops like adorama.

3rwCMLVPaa	Hi    The unfortunate thing is that cell phone providers don't give out their numbers let alone the names.    It's pretty difficult to get the name but as Charles said in the previous comment there are some companies that have most numbers.    I spent close to two hours tring to get one and had to give up in the end.    I think it cost close to $10 to get a number from some of these sites - at least tha's what I've heard - some are more expensive.

This site:  http://www.411.com/reverse_phone  will actually tell you the carrier as well (TMobile, Verizon, etc)  but will charge you to get the other information, which I didn't try so I'm not sure if it works.  Good luck!|`|V6dTJXK5aa	I think its really hard to find out specific information such as a name when It comes to cell phone numbers, I havent found the information I was looking for from free sites.

If you can afford it I think a paid option is a better option, but perhaps this number is not that big of a deal to you.    I read this from an article:  http://ezinearticles.com/?Reverse-Phone-...

60YOy0rHaa	Yes, with the battery. Micro SD card- you can get them on Amazon.com, dirt cheap. They work well too. You can even get an adapter to get it so it can get into your computer too...|`|A1vdJ0huaa	How do I know?|`|qDzp6EH2aa	try a micro  sd card|`|j5JJNYfqaa	Yes it takes a memory card. its a micro mini..there is a spot for it behind the battery. unlock the little silver piece of metal thats there by sliding it back and then put the memory card in face down. lock it in place by sliding it up.  good luck!|`|8EwwSlZ6aa	after you remove the battery, you'l see a metal part with little arrows on it. Those mean you have to slide the metal part so that it will open like a door. Put the memory card in it, then close the door and slide it back.

1HtTxOOQaa	Ya it happens with me too.I exchanged my 360 for a PS3 after it suffered from RROD thrice. But just the other day, I invited them to my home plugged in my PS3 to my 42" plasma in FULL HD and just started playing the Killzone 2 demo I downloaded a month back. All of them were shell shocked at the graphics. Then they started saying 'only graphics doesn't make a good game....' and said that the reviews would be awful guess what, I opened the PS3 browser(they even didn't know a PS3 can surf the net like a normal comp) and went to IGN where they had reviewed the game and had given it a 9.6. Afterwards, they have not teased me for buying a PS3. These 360 fans don't know a **** of how good a PS3 is. I am sooooo happy I exchanged a 360 for the PS3    Can't wait to see their faces when games like God Of War 3, GT5, Uncharted 2, Infamous... come out.|`|5tGiVemXaa	had the same problem got an xbox got rid and got an ps3 at first everyone was like wtf u duin thts **** etc. but then half way through last year other mates started to buy the ps3 now i know more ppl on the ps3 and less on the xbox so wen theres a debate or somthing ps3 always wins. if u do have mgs4 show them tht and then they will convert there and then to ps3 and show them a bluray movie on it and tht shud shut them up and trust the dark night on blu ray looks amazing|`|AA11760438	my friend says the same to me, after his mom couldnt afford him the ps3. he claims it gives him better picture on the games.. even if I have a 49 inch HDTV LCD 1080 and he only has a 480i 19 inch tv.. i dont understand his points.. He claims his Xbox is better,...lol.. after he couldnt afford the ps3..|`|HPRL3rriaa	haha yea me too none of my friends have ps3 and about 8 of them have the xbox 360. I just got one for christmas and they kept on saying like oh why u got that or look at the sales ps3 sales are way down that means it sucks and also most of the time we play madden and they kept on saying madden nation is played on xbox. but i'm happy with my ps3 free blueray player, free online, dont have to waste money on damn batteries for controllers or for that extra accessorie to get wi-fi.

qxzinKjxaa	What's the iso file size exactly? With my burner, it's not 4.7GB but 4.3GB only so make sure to check the size of your empty disc on your software burner.     Although, you mentioned that it's a Wii disc, then it would probably able to fit unless it was meant to be burned into a dual layer disc (8.5GB) if the file size is really 4.6GB more or less.    If the file size is small enough to fit, then try updating your software.

qXQa06bAaa	The Nikon D40 is usually the Default first choice Digital SLR of most people, closely followed by the ones in the Canon range:  http://www.steves-digicams.com/2007_revi...  http://www.steves-digicams.com/2007_revi...  http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...  http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...  http://astore.amazon.co.uk/jdcouk-photog...    However, a cheaper alternative that I swear by are a range of camera by Fuji (S-series) + Olympus (SP-5** series)... which have the looks & style of a DSLR, just as good performance.... but you don't have to mess on choosing loads of different lenses, or have to send them in for servicing every once in a while to get them cleaned out where the lens attaches to the camera.  Personally I have the Fuji S6500fd, which appears to have been discontinued... but the Fuji S100fs / S1000fd / S8100fd currently in the range are seriously good cameras... as are the Olympus SP-560uz / SP-570uz  http://astore.amazon.co.uk/jdcouk-photog...  http://astore.amazon.co.uk/jdcouk-photog...  http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital...    Fuji in particular are absolutely obsessed with making the image quality of their cameras the most perfect true-to-life ones money can buy.    Here's a few I've taken on my S6500:  http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11...  http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11...  http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11...  http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=55...  http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=28...

Should get it around 240-270 and it is excellent value.    Don't spend all your budget on the camera, save some for another lens.  If you buy a 400 camera you can not then buy an additional lens for it.  Minolta was bought by Sony, so old Minolta AF lenses fit the new Sony A200.    Buy a Sony A200, it comes with the 18-70mm lens, this should be a good starter lens.  There are many other lenses from Sony, Minolta, Tamron, Sigma etc., available.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Nikon D60 or Nikon D40 are great for beginner.|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.    Good luck!
hWc65sEtaa	Phones are a privilege.  You need to let your parents know.  Just tell them straight out.|`|Td7Kujqeaa	Well, no offense but i can see where mom and dad are coming from. Phones arent cheap. However, being honest with them is the best way to go. And, its not really my business, but why do you keep losing phones? Are you going out (movies, or whatever) and leaving them places...or are they falling outta your purse/bag? Either way when you do get another phone invest in a good case with a clip. Clip it to your pants pocket, inside of your purse, whatever. that should help.|`|PuRpsENEaa	Just tell them. Maybe since your telling the truth they'll get you a new one. or maybe they'll wait until they no for sure you're responsible enough to keep one. Good luck!|`|ibpoLakuaa	well dang haha i haven't heard of anyone losing more phones. i do understand what your mom and dad are talking about though. like the person said before me, phones aren't cheap. they are a huge responsibility to keep track of and make sure they don't get stolen. the best thing to do is be honest with them. if you lost your phone you have no idea rather it's in someone else hands or not. they could be racking up your cellphone bill.    bottom line, i would say be honest with your parents and tell them. it's never good to lie especially to them. make sure next time you get a phone it stays right besides you 200% of the time. good luck!
zzVB6e4gaa	I have a leather case on mine from Belkin but i strongly HIGHLY recomend Invisible Shield by Zagg. It is almost unscratchable i have it on mine. You can put it on by yourself by ordering online or some malls have kiosks that put it on for you. It is basically a sheet of stretchy plastic that covers your iPod and really helps against scratching    it costs 11$ for just the front or around 25$ for the whole iPod

Td7Kujqeaa	I just got the Pantech Matrix from AT&T and LOVE IT. Its a dual sliding phone, so it slides up to reveal the number keypad and slides sideways to get to your keyboard. Its NOT a smartphone, so its not complicated or expensive, but its 3G capadable, and has AIm, yahoo IM, email, internet, XM radio...all kinds of cool stuff. The price is 129.99 with a two year contact BUT you get a 50 dollar mail in rebate so its really only 79.99. go to   www.cnet.com   type "pantech matrix" in the search box and it will give you a full review ( much better than the short reviews on the at&t website) the phone comes in three colors, blue, red and black/neon green. I have the blue and my husband has the black/green. I really love this phone
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Formatting a memory card starts a new File Allocation Table.  Pictures are not removed from memory cards with delete or format.  When old pictures are replaced with new pictures then the old pictures are really gone.     When pictures have been deleted or memory cards have been formatted, a memory card reader will be needed to recover the pictures.       If there are no memory card slots on your computer, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6 each on Tuesday and Wednesday.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.

With a outdoor antenna the channel master 4221HD will get you 30 digital channels if used outdoors on a pole pointing to Buffalo (south) , A indoor antenna I would recommend something like a phillips mant940 or rca  ANT711 you can look them up and I have seen stores in Toronto sell them like warepark. As for channels with the outdoor channels master you can get  2-1 nbc  2-2 nbc weather  4-1 cbs buffalo  5-1 cbc    7-1 abc  7-2 this tv   9-1 ctv  11-1 E channel  17-1 pbs  17-2 pbs  17-3 pbs  23-1 The CW  25-1 French channel  26-1 religion  26-2 religion channel  29-1 fox   29-2 fox sd (dont see the point)  36-1 CTS  41-1 global   44-1 omni 2  49-1 mytv  49-2 mytv sd (no point)  51-1 ion TV should be coming after feb 17 with 3 sub channels.  57-1 City TV  64-1 omni 1  66-1 Sun TV    I basically preffered and bought a HDTV because these channels are  all free HD and dont have to pay anything I just invested with a HDTV   and a Channel master outdoor antenna.

d381leKpaa	you could buy a usb stick yes, i'm sure that would work. i havn't checked it out on a ps3 yet.. i know i should before answering this question, but on the wii it gives you an option of looking at saved data on the Hard Drive, or memory card. It will tell you there how much space that game is taking up.  Again, i'm sorry but i should have researched but i'm pretty sure that you can save it to your PSN account online or something... i think there's a place that tells you how to back up your memory online. Also, you could get a cord that has 2 USB sides, plug one end into your computer, and the other into your PS3. it should show up that you have plugged something in on your computer, and than just open up the files from the PS3, click and drag into a new folder  Hope i helped... I think these are all workable ways, i've heard that they've been done before, like from friens having problems with that.|`|Li45o7ovaa	i would go and buy an external hard drive that matches the same amount of mem that the ps3 has then do a back up and save all your files onto it then when you buy a new ps3 you can have all of your old data|`|GxLpWJZNaa	yes you can save the saved file thats in your ps3 to a usb i've done that before i copied a saved folder of call of duty 4 that was in the ps3 to a usb. about the size of the usb i have no idea. sorry.|`|avhbT0Bfaa	Good question, I would suggest taking out the old hard drive and putting in a new one.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	first of all, this is a crappy idea for several reasons that can be obtained by doing a simple search on this site for "Xbox 360 laptop"  Please,. for the sake of time and the health of your laptop, invest in a wireless adapter or a long cord.  You don't have to pay $100, either:    http://www.amazon.com/wireless-gaming-ad...    But, to answer your question, you need to be using a crossover Ethernet cable, which is NOT the cable that came with the 360, it is a special cord for connecting 2 computers without a router.  Also, you need to set up the laptop to "bridge" its wireless connection with the Ethernet port, which can be done in the network connections control panel.

Some of the routers are around $30 and it's way better than cords.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	get a router and then the internet channle|`|AA11045021	If you have an ethernet cable then all you have to do is go out and buy the Wii Lan Adapter. It's about $25 bucks. Hook that up to your modem and your good to go.    The next thing to do would be to go buy a Wii points card. That's about $20 bucks for 2000 points. After you hook up your adapter, go to the Wii Shop Channel and buy the Internet Channel. It's 500 points. You should be all set after that! Enjoy yourself.
HZo9ogGhaa	World at War, I only played it for a bit but the graphics were awesome the play was simple and the story line down to earth.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	Call of Duty World at War|`|eN1bRdo6aa	Call of Duty is a great game with a good story and if you had COD 4, then you know all about the online. Just great. Skate 2 has a fairly good story, but the getting off your board feature sucks, because your character walks around like there's something in his way all the time. It basically sucks.   I would stick with COD.|`|4LtszRxEaa	Call of Duty World At War is great on Xbox live and campaign you can also play coop Xbox Live. Skate 2 is bad for live i thought and the story was kind of stupid.|`|XMJS3lrwaa	For story get Fallout 3 and online World at War. I know Fallout wasn't a choice but it's the best story game of all time!!!
a9wRfuuSaa	I don't think so. We had a couple of pairs of the movie theater style glasses and tried to use them at home on the Voyage to the Center of the Earth 3D DVD, but didn't see any effects. However, the red/blue glasses that came with the movie didn't work very well either, but that could have been our TV as well. There was a noticible difference between the theater style and red/blue style though.    Don't know if the red/blue glasses will work in a theater though - haven't tried that.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Who says they aren't?  If you watch HDTV, they are almost all in 16 x 9 format and fill the entire screen.  They certainly are on my HDTV.    However these leaves networks a choice on how to show it on standard TV.  They can slice off the sides and show it as a 4:3, or they can shrink the image so you can see the entire scene the way it's filmed, but that results in bars on the top and bottom.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	All HDTV TV programs are exactly 16:9.  Perhaps you have some funny aspect-ratio selected on your box or TV that gives you bars?    Not all shows or commercials are shot in HD so there are still lots of 4:3 ratio shows around which cause bars.|`|0030f5e590ff16086572cdefc7f73ce4aa	cuz they dont want to be?|`|RyvKws7Laa	Most, if not all, TV shows are currently being delivered in full 16:9, whether it be SD or HD.  You can shoot SD Anamorphic and deliver a SD full frame 16:9 now.  I can't think of any major broadcaster that will accept shows that are not delivered as such.    If you are seeing 4:3 on your 16:9 set still, then perhaps you're watching a SD feed on a HD channel (it happens).  Or perhaps you have not set up your TV or cable properly then.  I can't think of any shows I watch right now that aren't full frame 16:9.    By the way, black bars on the top and bottom is called letterbox.  Black bars on the left and right is called pillarbox.  Widescreen does not imply/demand any kind of black bars.
EfejPjIMaa	The only PS3's that can play PS2 games have 4 USB ports and built in memory card slots.  If yours does not have this, then it can't play PS2 games.  That is the easiest way to know.    If you haven't changed out your HDD, then go to XMB > Settings > System Settings > System Information.  Under system information you should see your HDD space, for example 18GB/35GB.  This means you have a 18GB available of 35GB total, and will mean you have a 40GB PS3 (the PS3 will always show less total GB available because of the System Start Up space needed).      You can also look at your model number.  Here are the model  's: 20GB (model  CECHB01), 40GB (model  CECHG01), 40GB (model  CECHH01), 60GB (model  CECHA01), and 80GB (model  CECHE01).  I know its not the 20GB, 60GB, or 80GB model cause those are all backward compatible, so it is probably a 40GB model.|`|nM1DMsNFaa	it tells you on the box does it not if not look at receipt if you bought it online look at the site.|`|7gL9laqLaa	Could be a 40 gb|`|rYxFKDy4aa	has to be backwards compatible...best bet would be to borrow a ps2 game and try and play it...save you alot of ttime...i dont believe 40g are b/c tho
ptrfcYhHaa	the 2 flat slots are for the memory cards. theres a little window next to the slots, you have to pull up the white part to reveal the slots. its the same thing with the controller slots. all you need for gamecube is on the top of the wii. there are just the little doors you need to open.|`|iH07L6iDaa	you will see on top of the wii that where you are looking is in a pretty small compartment. the other part of the top of the wii will open and now you will see the ports.     click the link for pic:  http://www.tgdaily.com/picturegalleries/...|`|GoUfbrQYaa	on the top of the wii you have to open a hatch and ther they are

H9zYhBeRaa	Hi  Linksys are ok for wireless from probably just about anywhere in your house but for some reason when i connect my ipod touch to the router aswell and take it a couple of metres outside my house it looses connection. My linksys router has only 1 ariel so i suppose if you get a linksys wireless modem with 2 ariels than the connection should be a lot better. They are also very simple to set up.    I have this linksys wireless modem: http://hisamudin.com/wp-content/uploads/...    But i would suggest one like this: http://img.systemaxdev.com/productmedia/...    Hope This Helps.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I can't give you a comparative answer on their products as you ask about, but I can tell you that linksys has about THE WORST help services I've EVER had to do business with.  God Bless you.

q0ErVj1Daa	The Wii is a gaming system with both interactive and non interactive games.     The Wii works with TV's that have colored jacks. Look for on the front, side, or back of your TV for three holes that have yellow, white, and red rims on them. If they do, then yes a Wii would work with your TV.    A great place to buy a Wii is at Gamestop, Amazon, Best Buy, or any other electronics store. They are in high demand though and are usually sold out and hard to find. The Wii is 250 dollars and it comes with a game called "Wii Sports"    You don't have to buy the Wii Fit game with the Wii. The Wii Fit game is sold seperately for 90 dollars.|`|raEUval8aa	The Wii is a game console that plugs into your TV, and it has over 800 games available for it (though 600 of them are terrible.) The Wii should be able to work on your TV. Don't worry about it not being HD, as the Wii can not even play in HD.    Any store like Wal-Mart, Target ,Best Buy will work.    The Wii console itself is $249.99. Wii Fit is $90.00.    There are no official bundles, both must be purchased separately.      And a word of warning.    Wii Fit will not make you fit. It is meant as a kind of inspirational tool to get people to think about being healthy. It focuses primarily on balance and posture, not on getting in shape. And the scale is a little off most of the time. If you want to get fit, you will need more than Wii Fit. You will need real exercise, and you will need to eat correctly.|`|qbZmltI7aa	Best thing i can say about the Wii is that its so easy to use and natural. Because of the motion sensors in the controllers rather than pressing buttons and gettin confused, say in the bowling game, you just bowl with your arm like in real life. This make the whole thing accessible and meant that at christmas we had 7 year olds playing with 87 year olds an loving it.   The only thing you NEED is a bit of space in your living room to swing your arms around!
q0ErVj1Daa	You have to go to the Wii home where all the channels are. Next, click the circle all the way in the in the lower right corner of the screen. Then go to the Wii Address book and it will show your Wii console number that friends need to add you. Click register after that and it will tell you to put in your friend's Wii number.    Once you have done that put in their name and if they have registered you, you can both send messages to each other and other various things. Have fun!

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	if it is not on the router, then it is something that you set.  Those are the only 2 possibilities, unless someone else set the router and you don't know the password, at which point you should reset your router with the reset button    power cycling is unplugging, waiting (usually 2 minutes) and then plugging it back in|`|4Pk6VNftaa	The WEP was configured on the Router.  It's essentially a password for your router.  Any wireless device that wants to connect to your router needs to send the WEP first.  The router then issues an IP address and other settings needed to access the internet.  No WEP, no IP address, which is why it keeps saying "IP Address Failed."    Whoever set up the router should know the WEP, and hopefully wrote it down somewhere!  Any wireless device you're going to use, like a laptop, your 360, etc. will need to have it entered into its wireless settings in order to connect to your router, and then to the internet.|`|yfi5iB7Zaa	the wep key is at the bottom of the router if not then find your dns server number. then type it in the adress bar. type the password (if necessary)(was set-up when installing internet) and it will tell you.
mb3ooc3uaa	Yea, what the others are saying. There is not much info on the game yet. Its been said that the game will be out sometime in the fall of this year. That's why on sites it says Dec 31, cause they don't know. This is the only game I'm looking forward to on the 360 this year.|`|MIEGzslNaa	December 31, 2009|`|b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	ok, first answer is bullcrap, there is no set date on the next call of duty.  Modern warfare was the 4th one, world @ war was the 5th, and now infinity ward (the developer of the even-numbered ones) should be starting on the 6th one.  We don't know if it will be modern warfare themed or not, because it is an ongoing series.  Modern warfare was not a new IP, it was a continuation of the (very) old COD series.    And most new games are released on Tuesdays, and never on holidays, making the above answer even more incorrect|`|4LtszRxEaa	December 31 NO WAY and it is going to be Modern Warfare Infinity Ward has not announced a Release date.|`|2DyFXV7Faa	Q4 of this year... i hope it doesn't get pushed to 2010, but i highly doubt that because i don't think that infinity ward has ever done that before.|`|Un511PNWaa	it's set for Fall this year, look it up on google lots of stuff comes up|`|SBcxooLsaa	sometime in novemberbecause every cod game made has been released in november on a tuesday so sometime in novemberon a tuesday best i can do sorry i wish i could help you more
r4FJjEGiaa	Are you asking how to add the email to the blackberry or how to have custom notifications once the email is already added? Anyway, to add email - first you need the data plan, then go to the internet email icon.   Once the email is set up - go to the Profiles icon - scroll down to advanced. Now you can press menu on any of the profiles you want to edit and press edit. You'll see a huge list of things you can customize sounds for - just go to the email address and have fun setting different tones for all your different profiles! hopefully that answered your question.

There wont be a "better" version. Only expansion packs. There are updates for games though.
nQ7G1nBVaa	The HDMI in the cable box is also an output.    You need to use another output from the computer to the TV which both have.    If the TV has DVI, your best bet is to get  an HDMI to DVI adapter.  You will need to run audio as well.

SvCWYg5Maa	It's probably about to break.  Mine did a similar thing while I was playing Forza 2, the screen turned to static and the top left, bottom left and bottom right quadrants lit up red.  I switched it off and it worked again a bit later, but then broke again and I sent it back to Microsoft for a free repair.    Go to the xbox website and register your console, then submit a repair request and they'll email you a label to print and stick on a box so you can send it back.  UPS came round to pick mine up.|`|v6ZWDeLtaa	Same thing happened to me, you need to file a repair order. Call 1-800-4my-xbox and it is free if you have a warranty. It takes about two weeks but at the end they send you a 1 month gold membership trial! It is a hard drive failure (manufacturer's defect)|`|katIlecuaa	Xbox fckin sucks!!! ps3 forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
prE6n6k2aa	Hello Andrew, you should get a flash light and buy 2 batteries of each brand time how long by appx hours each one keep the flashlight lit the longest dont be lazy honey this is what i would make my child do. People on here can and will say anything, document and make notes it get you a better grade. Hope this helps and keep up the good work because at least your doing your work some kids wont even go as far as you did to even ask and if money is an issue in sure a parent wouldnt mind forkin over 8 bucks to help you in school. Also make sure all of your battery expry dates are around the same for a fair comparison. Now a days you can even get name brand batteries at the 1dollar store and they dont last long because they are usually old, so dont buy one from sears and the otther from dollar store lol take care.
Z0BNqCVAaa	Pay for them like the rest of us hard-working folk. Stop trying to publicly ask people to help you lie, cheat and steal your way through life.
pfZ6va4Caa	no. call of duty world at war for wii has been toned down to the minimum, With only a few of the maps from Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, no Zombie Mode, bad graphics, and hardly and online capability, Call of Duty World at War for wii is only for those who will play the campaign and live through the small multiplayer.  Hope the helped|`|q0ErVj1Daa	No. Apparantly the Wii can't support downloadable content for Call of Duty but I bet it could. Activision is just lazy.
hHQIUrNjaa	they are in 3 different categories of games    The 360 and PS3:    360 is good. It works well in 1080i and has a dual core processor. It has a nice selection of games. Its online costs money. It has a 40% failure rate (red lights), meaning that you have a 40% chance of your 360 breaking right off the bat. There are lots of noobs and little kids on xbox live. Xbox 360 has an attachable HD-DVD at an extra cost, but they dont even make HD-DVDs anymore. the HDD (hard drive disk) costs extra. 360 uses DVDs, which are a max of about 8 gb.    PS3 is amazing. It runs 1080p naturally. It has a 7 core processor, each doing its own job like physics, gfx, audio, AI, ect. It is more expensive than the 360, but its going down soon. Its online is free and you can download full games, demos, blu-rays, themes, psp games, ect. on the PSN (playstation network). PS3 has playstation home, which is like an MMORPG without the fat people living in their basement with a case of chips and fresca and its free. PS3 has Blu-Ray built in. Infact the games use Bluray, which are 40gb or 80gb double written. Bluray can hold 1080p without any upscaling. Every PS3 comes with a HDD, so PS3 games are installed onto the HDD for nonstop play and super quick load times for ridiculous amounts of stuff. PS3 has a 0.02% failure rate, meaning that you have a 1 in 5,000 chance of failure. I have PS3, but I also owned 360 so i dont have a bias. PS3 also has alot of games, and all sport games are going to be made on PS3 now, meaning a better game. Also, GT5. When it is hard to differ a picture from the game, i think it speaks for itself.    Wii is very fun. It has a large selection of games and complete reverse compatibility. Wii has a single core processor and can do 480p, but wii isnt about gfx, its about gameplay. Wii is $250.00, but very hard to find. I have wii and I still love (ive had it since the first christmas after launch)    PSP is ok. The gfx are ps2. Its basically a ps2 in your hand. It can play UMDs and anything you can fit on a memory stick duo. You can use a PSP as a screen for PS3 and play PS3 with PSP. PSP has skype, a phone service.    The moral of the story is that PS3 beats everything 360 can throw at it, wii is awesome, and psp is ok to have, but if you aren't going anywhere far like traveling, its not worth it.|`|raEUval8aa	PSP doesn't even really count since it's a handhelp platform.    But the Wii is just filled to the brim with hundreds of games like Baby Pals and Petz it's just overwhelmingly embarrassing.    And the Xbox 360 just reeks of Microsoft's attempts at greedily harvesting your money, forcing you to pay extra and purchase all of these extra things.    PS3 is the best in my opinion.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i can tell you that XBOX 360 IS THE BEST!!!!! ps3 can be at second place and nintendo.............erm........not in the list|`|NEp6WZXIaa	yeah, i think the wii is the best too......|`|97h4EsNAaa	the best video game is xbox 360 pro or elite becuse that is a cheap video game and it has good graphics and this year loads of people buy xbox 360 than ps3 and wii and psp.    so if i was you go buy the xbox 360    theres 4 deals      xbox 360-arcade-old tv  xbox 360-pro-20gb-hd/old tv  xbox360-pro-60gb-hd/old tv  xbox360-elte-120gb-hd|`|3xXIKcMOaa	Ahhh. You might want to welcome in a PS3.  Graphics really delicious, and doubles for a blue ray player.  But, I would wait for the price drop to take place first. It won't happen until.. April I heard, but you would be saving 100bucks.    Honestly, I greatly DESPISE my 360Elite. I personally think the games for xbox aren't that good, unless you like zombies and shooting... just about everything. That;s all you really have to choose from.    Wii, isn't that bad, but has many crap games like Petz and many many kiddish games. But the wonderful games that wii does have, are madly addicting.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	I actually think the DS better.    My favorite game happens to be on the Wii, but the DS has a huge library of great games, and it's the system I play the most nowadays.|`|7uYAus8laa	xbox 360, I love the nintendo too, but the Xbox 360 just has way better games from 3rd party members (CoD4) Well Nintendo has great nintendo games, SSBB, Zelda, Mario...  Also the xbox 360 has better graphics, which is a plus, but it is all about the games and Xbox 360 has better games. And soon to come Resident evil 5! Also the online of Xbox 360 is just godly. In my opinion is that the Xbox 360 is more of the "real gamer" which you can play games for hours and hours, well the Wii have very addictive games, but only last for a couple o hours.    And for the PS3 is a powerful machine and it comes with everything except the kitchen sink, but it does not have as many games as the xbox 360.    But it all depends on what kind of games you like, but for me its the xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, PS3, DS, and PSP|`|rYxFKDy4aa	they all got different aspects, wii, you can move around alot...downfall is not all games can be made for wii which limits its power...ps3...graphics are awesome and you can basically use it as a computer, dpwnfall is they have games not made for it...as for all of em,...xbox...microsoft made it so its a POS but awesome games are made for it...i chose ps3 with the wii for a back up...had a 360 but it broke for no reason...go figure
e7c2ae69762e95dde32cf6d10668ccfbaa	Could it be a faulty memory card? Have tried another one?|`|AA12180617	You cna performa a software reset via the menu's using the settings on the 'play' setting on the dial.    however this is more likly due to problems with memory card or low battery than a firmware fault as the Lumix firmware is renownd for being stable and all (except LX2) have good image quality and interpolation
CWUb6eTWaa	Can you be a little more specific? It could be a few things but what burning program are you using and are you getting any error messages? It could probably be: It isn't a DVD-RW just a DVD R, or the session is still open or, the disc may need to be cleaned or, try another DVD and if it still has the same problem it could be that the drive is starting to go. Without specific error messages its hard to troubleshoot the problem.
P1yr6HT0aa	You did get a good deal. The code in that game is worth a free month of play, valued at approximately $15.00 (USD). In addition, the collectors' DVD edition came with a figurine AND a set of ingame goodies that you CANNOT purchase directly from PlayNC. If nothing else, you got $5 off a month's playtime.

tueHUkoTaa	Windows Movie Maker is a very good program for amateurs. It's very simple, and efficient.

It will give you the best resolution your TV can handle.    No offense, but Bose products really suck.  I don't mean they're bad speakers.  I mean they're bad speakers for the price.  I mean $2,200?!  You can buy a 40 inch Samsung 120Hz 1080p LCD TV (or a Panasonic plasma TV), a good Blu-ray player, a good set of 5.1 speakers, a good mid-range a/v receiver, a rear wireless kit, a surge protector and all the necessary speaker and a/v cables for about that price.    In other words, you can go from owning nothing to having a fully HD audio and video system, all for the price of a Bose HTIB.  It would look and sound much better too.
3mAgM405aa	Unfortunate, the Nikon D60 is not the best choice when it comes to an overall quality photographic experience since:    1.  There's no built-into-the-body image stabilization and the Nikon auxiliary VR lenses are not inexpensive;    2.  The normal lense is too short and forces you to purchase an upgrade telephoto;    3.  There's no video with sound capability so you can't record piano playing, concerts, ballets, skateboarding, etc.    4.  And finally, there's no live-action viewfinder so you can compose your pictures prior to taking the picture.    So, is there a better more affordable alternative?  Please read the following:    If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.

My suggestion is to look at D40 model also, if you plan to post-process your photos on your computer later on. Since it's cheaper and has good flash sync speed, it makes a better buy. The noise performance is better for D40 at high ISO's.    (With Nikon also you can buy very good glass at a later stage when you can afford it.)|`|nU5UqACUaa	if you have the choice among all cameras in this price range, I just can give you one answer ...YES  If now you consider AF comfort and want to work in  more complex way and stuff, consider a higher level DSLR.

M9YNvbraaa	you will need to pay the no commitment pricing- that is the pricing without a contract.  The other prices require  a 2 year contract with at&t.  To break the contract will require an early termination fee usually around 175.00.  So the pricing you will need to pay with no contract, no commitment is the 329.99.  If you get the phone unlocked that will generally void the warranty, you probably will not be able to get insurance on it, and t-mobile will be able to do  very limited trouble shooting should anything go wrong with the phone.  Any further questions you should check with your carrier|`|5e564f59771ed76baf9cdea62df489eeaa	more than likely the no commitment price because you do not have a contract with at&t so you are not committed to be with them i could be wrong but you can ask around to be sure that just seems the more logical to me  the 179 is your discount for the 2 yr contract price so you would not qualify for that you do not qualify for the rebate because you are not on their service .
bcC8UiO3aa	Definetly call T-mobile first to see if the phone will be alright to use on their network. Sometimes when you get a phone unlocked, it may not be able to function the same ways it would on the carrier it was set up for. Sometimes T-mobile will have the files you need and they can send to your phone, so talk to someone in tech-support. More than likely T-mobile will tell you have to contact the manufacturer for an unlock code, but if you call samsung they won't give you that information. What you need to do is call a local Mom and Pop cellular phone store in your area, and ask them if they flash or unlock phones. If they do, take the phone to them and have them preform the service. If they don't, they can probably tell you who can. The people who do this my area charge anywhere from $40-$60, and it can sometimes take a day or two.|`|1c35839fe163d506da29d5f60d1bd252aa	O!

Call AT&T or t-mobile and ask how you can do so.|`|CNotcjbaaa	Call T-Mobile and ask them how to use an AT&T phone with their plan. They will help you because they don't want to lose you over to AT&T.     It's okay to ask questions, it's not dumb to not know this complicated stuff.
WOiH4CGvaa	Drum roll please! The answer is they are both better! For what they are designed to do.     The question is what do you want to do? Take high quality photos or videos?     I'll bet it's somewhere in between. You should look at some of the Canon Powershots, Sony Cybershoots, and the Nikon Coolpix.    All of these cameara take nice pictures, and at least U-tube quality video.    I'm guessing you might not want to spend 3K on a Canon 5D mark II? That's for the body, then you need len's.    Oh and Tom, I guess you've not played with a 5D mark II?

There are just two exceptions... The Nikon D90 and Canon 5D Mark II... and neither are without their limitations.  On the other hand a camcorder is not well suited to taking still photos.    The best option would be to have both. If your budget doesn't allow for this, then you could try a bridge/superzoom camera. You don't get the interchangeable lenses, optical viewfinder, or big sensor of a dSLR, but they are decent cameras that can also take decent video. Although with many models you do run into the problem of not being able to zoom.    If you don't need the camera immediately, another option might be to wait for the Panasonic G-HD (or whatever the final product name is). This isn't strictly a dSLR, but it does have many of its advantages. And it's supposed to be specifically built for video capture as well.|`|pmSHKJSPaa	Hi   If I understand your question correctly you want a video camera that will take a good still photo. Video by its nature is not a super sharp picture like a still camera (you just can't take process 30 frames per second in video and have as much high quality information) as you can taking 1 sharp still photo. I have seen Sony, JVC, and Canon cameras that do a pretty good job on video and also have a 4-6 megapixel still photo chip built into them .....I can't remember the model numbers now. You can contact me directly if you want to for more info.  The best solution would be to have both if your budget allows.   I don't think you will be able to find a still camera that takes a decent video.   Tom G    bravotom@yahoo.com

0753075e1794eb3ff616a2da11822f81aa	It appears to be a jumper.  Note the J number for identification.  Also, note the single black band -- that indicates zero in the standard resistor color code.  So, it is probably a zero ohm jumper -- which means it's just a wire.  It is made like that to allow for automatic insertion machines to install it during a high-speed production run.    These are often used to either allow for the same board to be assembled different ways for different products or to reduce the cost of the boards.  Sometimes, the signal needs to get to another section of the board and, while they could insert additional layers in the board to do that, sometimes it's cheaper to just install a jumper or two to the new section.    It is possible that it could be a type of fusible link (still basically just a wire), but I would think it would be indicated with an F number or FL number for identification if that were the case, since it would be replaced occasionally.

And when you sign up, you have to give them your mailing, payment info.   - You have to know where to download the songs yourself [Unless you want to pay for the music on iTunes]  - 8GB is not that much memory.

QIlhmWwBaa	just say it didn't work  i actually got a game that didn't work and just took it back to blockbuster said it didn't work and just took a new one and they didn't even check the game|`|1NmssVc2aa	Yeah, I would, but the only thing is make sure they don't have a PS3 so they can test the game.  I bought a PS3 game from game stop and it sucked, so I just said it didn't work and they took it back.  Good luck.

I8yV5Hglaa	I assume you mean the ''apps'', the programs that show up as boxes on the home page.  If so...    as the first answer said, the Touch includes a few apps, such as weather, maps, Safari (Internet), YouTube, and calendar.      Other ones can be downloaded from iTunes.  Some are free, some are not.  If you have iTunes, you can take a look around the App Store to see if you like it:  http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSto...|`|udmksvbAaa	the itouch comes with weather, calculator, browser, stocks, maps, and a couple more icons. the games and applications cost money, but there are some that are free.
uXQcDsiAaa	Ok take the long white cable that gives u internet connection.  Then, plug in the xbox 360|`|SLy9xFwkaa	alright dude im pretty sure file sharing only works with windows media player 11 so try WMP and turn on sharing. also you xbox has to be hooked to your computer through a router or wireless connetoin. and lastly your xbox will only show you thinks like music pictures and videos from your WMP library so youll need to import your files.

RyvKws7Laa	LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|Qk3oflwPaa	sony HDNA. i'd bet my grampa on it.|`|rXjRe7ZLaa	Try getting an Lcd. (liquid crystal display) preferably samsung, phillips, sony, or  sharp but make sure it has a high contrast ratio it makes the picture better. They are also usually flat screen and don't have much of a border like an analog T.V. and they last much longer than plasmas and are cheaper but just as good as a Dlp.|`|QQDaVwb0aa	Buy what ever TV looks good in the shop, then buy extended warrany also - no matter what brand/model the TV is, there is a 70% chance it will fail within 2 years of normal daily use
IxoBFCpTaa	? To check messages, you have to go online and log into your account.  ? The ringer volume does 2 things:  1) You will not hear a ring when a call is made. It is on silent mode.  2) If you are playing with an app that has noise, it will not make noise if the ringer is off. For music, it will still play even if ringer off is on.    ? Are you sure it is on sleep? Sleep is when you just quickly tap the top right button once. Turning it off is holding it for about 4-5 seconds until it completely shuts off and you turn it on the same way and see the apple logo.  ? If this does not work, then try charging it.  ? If that does not work, hook it up to iTunes, and restore the iPhone.          Peace ?  ^_^
fdlhUxzRaa	no, on the white G1 the back of the device is grey. That is just how they are made. You can check out Ebay and buy a snap on case but the back for that device is grey because it's made of that rubber-ish feeling material and if it were white like the slick face of the device it would get super dirty.   So no HTC does not have a white back you can purchase directly from them.
hSubLAVhaa	I its not true because i own an ipod touch 32 gig 2nd generation you dont need one.|`|KeaEQXvqaa	itunes and ipods suck.  I use a flash player with a standard USB cable and load/unload files with windows explorer.
rSFm5eRaaa	Both gun shells can play the same games. However, I recomend the perfect shot because it is much better than the zapper. It's more like a real gun.    Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles  Ghost Squad  House of the Dead Return  House of the Dead Overkill|`|iH07L6iDaa	the nyko perfect shot is better then the zapper but the zapper is fine to. both guns are compatable with Almost any shooter game but the games i reccomend are:    1)Call of duty:world at war    2)007 quantum solace (ok not as good as COD:WAW)    3)killzone 1/2    4)and any other shooter game for wii    hope this helps :)    ps if you want any reviews on the different guns click the links:    perfect shot:http://gear.ign.com/articles/841/841403p...

FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it on ValueJockey.com. It is free and a great place to find out the value of just about everything. Include a picture in the listing, it helps a lot.  http://www.valuejockey.com/|`|GpMJlbHyaa	prob $280|`|zR8PLMdfaa	Probably Enough To buy A PS3 Haha|`|WtzhAvdsaa	if you go to funco its like fifty dollars|`|fwIe1sQwaa	Like $250, atleast I would guess.    But why are you willing to give up all that? I'd keep it if I were you.
TF7ffV6maa	Wow my phone did the exact same thing and I think i know why.  Well as you know Verizon and Alltel merged.  So it's like now our phone is trying to get signal from both towers in the area and it can't decide between the two. i dont know.  My phone did the same thing and when i'de dial *228, it'd say US Cellular, then sometimes it'd say alltel...then sometimes itd say Verizon on the voice prompt.  But what you may want to do is to to teh store, and tell the technician.  THey might give you a new phone (which is what they did to me)
3NKQUIglaa	Im not quite sure what you are asking. For the subwoofer, you are going to need to buy a subwoofer cable splitter and either one or two subwoofer cables to go with that. That is at least if both subs are for your home theater. And your tv and computer should be in separate inputs in the back of your receiver, which then will allow you to switch between them.|`|sER6UGMWaa	the best thing for you to do is go and pay someone to install the system for you... if you dont know how to hook it up dont bother doing it..
TF7ffV6maa	well there might be a Kilobyte charge or something.  As in, it might not charge to have java, but it might charge to use java
4lcFNsQ8aa	I would recommend Sony Ericsson, nokia is fragile, low battery life, crashes, bad reception. Sony ericsson on the other hand is awesome in battery life and reception. I have the Sony ericsson w595 and i charge it every about 2 weeks.|`|9YHiaaRMaa	Sony Ericson . It is the best phone ever itt has so many cool things u can do on it like add stuff to photos and its just awesome oh and it actually comes with games. Funny thing ive had both of those phones but know i have a iphone definetly recomend it

YKc3YrxXaa	Unfortunately, no, the CECHL models won't play PS2 games. An easy way to tell if it will play or not is if it has 4 USB ports. If it does, then it will play, and if it doesn't, it won't play. The only PS3 models that will play are the 20, 60 and the older 80 GB models.    Hope this helps!!
Kjw8KTifaa	use desktop software, that came with ur phone or sd card reader
fdlhUxzRaa	yes a SIM card is $20 you can buy a entire pre paid phone kit for about $30 and it comes with a SIM and a phone. The phone isn't anything fancy but it will be good to use as a back up|`|bcC8UiO3aa	if your not receiving any additional minutes, than that is to much. most of the time you can purchase a sim card for as little as $15. try calling t-mobile and see what they charge. but if your doing prepaid you will have to purchase additional minutes for your service to work. if prepaid is actually the route you wanna stay on, do a little homework. T-mobile doesn't have the best deals on prepaid. Try somebody like Boost Mobile, or Pay-Go by Cricket (may not be available everywhere). They have way more competitive rates, because they specialize more to that market.
tZXIDOgAaa	did your little brother save the game to the hard drive?  that makes the fan make less noise|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Theres no problem. Well maybe, Since the fans are not blowing hard, it might overheat. I wouldnt worry about it if you have Warranty.

AA10508409	Nope... Sorry. That happened to me once before and it was a pain in the @$$ but you will have to cope. I know it sucks but if I do it you probably can. Just move songs day by day.
ada38d40b8a478e4e22c3765f3ad91e9aa	These are, as they say, digital broadcasts rather than the old analog. Your old CRT wouldn't know what to do with a digital channel and would ignore it.   That's what all this DTV changeover is all about. The broadcasts are now becoming digital, which you've surely noticed is a much clearer picture. Much like the difference between a digital camera and a film camera. Well, maybe that's not a great example, but you get the idea. You'll probably see (for the next week or so) the same station sending both the old analog and digital version of their broadcast.
gk12l1zXaa	there is a way you can do it, visit the link below, and it explains exactly how to do it.|`|H4nHgUpnaa	plug in your ipod on your computer and check manage music or something. then when you get on her computer you should be able to drag and drop.    if that still doesn't work tell your friend to update her itunes.

KBXJeIKtaa	The only game for Wii that I know that has chat is Animal Crossing: City Folk and that can come with the Wii Speak Microphone. You know what give it a try buy a headset for Wii.

AA12343006	Yes, think of it as if your data plan is in your sim card. When you switch phones the data plan will be accessible in the new phone you put the sim card in.

VMVW3E7Aaa	It is called shutter lag, and all little P&S cameras suffer from it.  From all I"ve ever heard, those little Kodak things are even worse than others.    Check out the specifications and compare many different cameras (www.dpreview.com), but don't expect miracles from any of them.    If you want NO shutter lag, you'll need to get a DSLR.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Some people call this '1st shot delay'.  It is primarily caused by the length of time that the camera takes to focus.  The older point and shoots had a horrible time with this.  Most of the newer ones have fixed the problem.  Some current Kodak cameras, the Z1015 IS, still have the problem.  Other Kodak camers, the Z1012 IS, have very good 1st shot delays.  Sorry, couldn't find the specific on the Z8612.  Go to a camera vendor and try it.

Rntb3m3vaa	Yes it will run on your current graphics card|`|Xxviy63Paa	It's hard to say. If it had said 7200, you would have been in decent shape. But there isn't an x200 model on that list, the lowest is 7300.    The top of each series are the x800 cards, usually several different versions. So the 9800 would be best of that series, then as the numbers move down the cards are scaled back, less power use, less speed, fewer operations. A x200 card is just about the most stripped-down version of any GeForce series.    A 7800, for example, is better than an 8200. And a 6800 better than a 7300, probably.     So there is only one way to be sure. That is Wikipedia. They have exact capabilities listed for every GeForce card. Look up the 8000-series and 7000-series. Write down the 8200's numbers, then look at the 7000-series and see if it beats the 7300. If it does, you should be in good shape.
TBuWclsjaa	Make sure you don't get back on until it asks you to. When you keep keep as steady as you can on the center of the board.
q9PRSP6uaa	When you download the app you have to start it up before you can use if.     If your talking about turning on its most likely broken i would recommend you use your warranty at this point.
3yvuMkzTaa	No, this happened to me. The only thing you can do is to keep searching.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU!!!!
o7rXjXWJaa	ok since you had purchased it before the big announcement of circuit city going belly up yea they should give you a refund but don't wait until the last minute to get it you don't want to be waiting  in line, because you might not be the only one.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	I have a great idea....Why don't you call them and ask? Then you would get a definite yes or no answer without a bunch of bad guesses here.|`|udmksvbAaa	i doubt they'll refund anything..they're losing enough money by going out of business so i think you're outta luck =/
aOZ7JPAgaa	you can...... DUDE the phone is UNLOCKED which = any sim can go in there!|`|EWuVYSOXaa	If the phone is unlocked you will be able to use the phone for voice calls and text only as T-Mobile sets up their phones where the data settings cannot be altered.

Only do this when you use the standard Red White and Yellow Cables after you use the HDMI cable.|`|AA11165496	When your system is off, and your going to power it on, keep your finger on the power until it beeps like 3 times, it turns all system settings back to default, and this includes your video, security, etc.    PSN:D-Rob92|`|OaEQpd4yaa	Unplug the HDMI cable and plug in the standard cables while the system is off. Turn it off to see if it worked.

N0d8qscNaa	You can fix it without opening it. I've seen this done before.  Don't try to turn on your iPod till your done. Thats what frys your iPod. If you've done it then you chance lessens to fix it everytime you turn it on.    Blow dry it for 20 mins (seems like a long time but worth it).  Then put it in a big cup of rice for 24-48 hours (overnight) and it will suck out all the moisture|`|mV2krdVwaa	FIX IT!!!!!!  it will be fun  get some tech-savvy friends to do it or you COULD pay for it like a loser (jk the lazy way is better lol)|`|tK3eS6MBaa	Yes water does damage an ipod Nano 3G.

Good luck!|`|kDj1NSiVaa	Don't be afraid to use a little force when removing stubborn memory cards!    Memory cards, especially micro SDs, are designed to be rugged and durable.    If you phone is already broken, you shouldn't worry about breaking it.    Get a pair of strong metal tweezers or jeweler's tongs (easy to find and cheap,) and once you have a secure grasp on the card, ease it out, twisting and bending (gently!) as necessary.    Once again, don't be afraid to use a little force! Those guys are tough; they won't break!|`|aOZ7JPAgaa	get a pen and push it and HOPE it will POP out .....
RS67p3SLaa	try google / yahoo-ing "cect mms att" should have mms settings and wap settings on several forums. If that does not work, it could be a defective unit... in future recommend getting a phone with atleast java, or windows mobile and wifi like the m99i miphone...

b69Gm5fPaa	Reset your receiver. If it continues......    Press Menu on your remote. Then select SETUP, then select SYSTEM SETUP, then select INFO & TEST, press up and then press RIGHT to highlight SYSTEM TEST and press SELECT. Select RUN TEST. It will run a series of tests including a phone line test.    If it passes, then the message should remove itself within 24 hours.    If it fails, then something is wrong with your phone line. It might not even be plugged in. Or the phone line might not even be active.     The reason it worked the first time is becuase the access card will allow you to order movies until you get to a certain amount. It will then stop allowing until you connect via phone line. Then it will let DTV know that you owe them money. If you never connect, then DTV will charge you once they get your equipment back and check your access card. But they will charge you, sooner or later.|`|qxzinKjxaa	Have you tried rebooting the box? That might work...

xwEPYEqSaa	Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, it's a common question asked among people. Here I will cover all the aspects of the two systems. I will compare and contrast the two of them in a non-biased way.    Part I: Hardware and discs.  Here we will cover everything about the two systems hardware and it's features.  First the Playstation 3:  PS3 has a bult in Blu-Ray player. If you don't know what Blu-Ray is, it is the newest format of movie entertainment. It is emitted in High-Definition. The average Blu-Ray disc player costs between 200 and 400$. The Playstation 3 costs 400$ so for that matter if you want a Blu-Ray player you can just buy a PS3 for the same price. Playstation's hardrive can either be 40 Gigabytes (GB), 80 GB or 160 GB. If none of those hardrives are big enough for you, you can buy a new hardrive of any kind, whether that by for a computer or anything. You can change the hardrive with ease. If you for some reason break the PS3 and have a different hardrive you can stil get it fixed for free if you have a warranty.    Xbox's hardware:  The Xbox 360's hardware is full of faults. It's system can overheat and breakdown if it is on for more than a few hours without a seperate cooling fan. Xbox games are programed onto Dual-layered DVD disc. That means it is a normal DVD with another one attached to it giving it double the storage capacity of one DVD. That still does not equal one PS3 Blu-Ray disc. Giving the PS3 games more room to make longer games and beter graphics. Not to mention what it could do using the dual layer technique. The Xbox has a lot of problems with the hardware. If you take your hardrive out you warranty becomes invalid.    Part II: Graphics  PS3:  If you compared a game with great graphics that is avaible or both systems, for example Call of Duty 5; it looks the same. That is because the the game's graphics were held back to fit the Xbox 360. Many games have been delayed due to the 360 holding it back from it's full potential.    360:  360 has amazing graphics but it is not close to the PS3. Gears of War 2 is said to have the best graphics for 360 just compare it to a game like Resistance 2 or Metal Gear Solid 4 for PS3 it's not even close which has better graphics, the PS3 games.    Part III: Software  PS3:  It is common to here that the Xbox has more games than the PS3. This however is not true. It was true when PS3 came out because Xbox had been out a year already. But in the last 2 years the PS3 has produced more games and has over taken 360 in terms of exclusive games. The list of major exclusives include, The Metal Gear Solid Series, Resistance series, Motorstorm, Grand Turismo, SOCOM and the God of War Series. There are more that are not in series including: Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, Little Big Planet, Kill Zone 2, Lair and Haze. They also share over 100 games with the Xbox including Call of Duty, Resident Evil, Sonic the Hedgehog, Medal of Honor and Grand Theft Auto.    360:  Xbox has very few exclusive games, there major ones are Gears of War 1 + 2, Halo 3, Fable II, Banjo Kazzoie and Mass Effect. The list ends there.....    Part IV:  On-console Features:  PS3: Playstation Home a virtual reality world, Life With Playstation a Weather and News Media channel. The Playstation Store were you can get demos, wallpapers, apps, game add ons and videos, all free. You can create avatars for Home. You can put pictures, music and videos on your PS3 aswell.    360:  You have music, videos, demos and add ons. But to access that you need to pay for online. It does not have anything similar to Home or Life with Playstation. The avatars on Xbox cannot compare to the realism of the Home avatars or even the Miis on Wii.    Part V:  Online Play:  PS3:  Online is 100% free on Playstation. You can use a wired connection or a Wi-fi connection, both are built into the PS3. There is a myth that there is a lot of lag on PSN that is untrue. The game Resistance 2 can have up to 50 people playing in the same game at once and there is no lag at all. Kill Zone 2 can have up to 200 players in the same game and no lag at all. So that myth is busted. You can use any kind of headset for PS3, Wired, Blue Tooth and even the Xbox head set. You can do video chats as well.    360:  You have to pay 50$ a year for online that is the same as PS3's. You can only use official Microsoft headsets for online play you cannot use any kind like the PS3 has. The Xbox Live game servers go down ocasionally while it never happens on the PS3.    Part VI: Company Dedication  PS3:  Sony is very dedicated to it's system. It even makes games for it some of those are Kill Zone, Warhawk and Heavenly Sword. If you break your PS3 even if it's on purpose you will still get a replacment if you have a warranty    360:  Microsoft even said the 360's purpose is to rival Sony in every buisness. Microsoft promised they would fix the Red Rings of Death problem over 2 years ago but they have not fixed it yet. if you remove the hardrive or break something|`|q06g4hHKaa	blu ray  free online  web browser  150+ exclusive games  sixaxis controller  great entertatinment system  home    but thats just off the top of my head.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	HD graphics (if you have HDTV)  free internet  Playstation Home  exclusive games  Sixaxis controller  Web browser  Musics, photos, videos  40-160 GB HDD|`|d381leKpaa	amazing graphics, and blue-ray, you get to have awsome games with amazing relizism, and watch blue-rays, and have a DVD upconverter after playing the ps3, and playing the wii, the wii will be a disappointment when you notice the difference. Great games, the shooter games on the wii, are not very fun, you have to be pointing for them and that just takes away from the experience, at least i think so anyways, it's pretty much the same experience for xbox but there's going to be more ps3 exlusives like resistance 1 and 2, killzone 1 and 2, LBP and so much more... but the ps3 is soooo amazing, they have the best graphics ever, supposedly i think i've heard that killzone 2 will only be using about 60% of the usage for graphics, i think it's 60, not sure if it's 30 tho. Hope i helped :D|`|HPRL3rriaa	yup u'll miss on free online, blueray player, play with up to 7 friends and dont have to waste ur money on damn batteries for ur controller i charge mine on my computer whenever my ps3 is off. Great games are about to come out|`|QIlhmWwBaa	well you would just miss out on a couple of decent games but if you do buy it wait a couple of months to when the prices drop by a 100 bucks   unless money is not a problem for you then go for it|`|pl2SocVKaa	you wil miss out on its great exclusives in paticular God of war 3 and killzone 2 so get it if you have all 3 you are in the best situation so you should get it|`|9sRUf4zEaa	just on the top of my head (note that sony will drop the price for the ps3 later this year)    complete media player (any dvd or downloaded video will be converted to a full HD quality, music video and pictures can be transferred by usb jump drive or on an online media server)  Free online community (online gaming, playstation home, and PSN)  Long list of ps3 exclusives (they say that killzone 2 will be the Halo 3 killer, but this is questionable in my opinion so waiting for Feb 27)  can be used as a cheep blueray player  free internet browser  free wi-fi (the 360 has a $100 add-on)   also you pay a higher amount at once and you just need to pay for additional game add ons and maybe a few downloable games  compared to the xbox live $50 a year per person atleast)
HlMOEP09aa	iphone isn't even worth it! my mom has one and we have a family plan and our bill is like 200 something because for the iphone they find all kinds of little things to charge you for. Plus we're finding out now that iphones are freezing up and you can't hear well....your choice mate

aicIZVGuaa	You broke the ps3 by hitting the switch in the back. Never do that when the system freeze like that press and hold the button in the front and till it beeps that how you reset your sytem.    This is sony online service request I suggest you use it to contact sony   https://service1.us.playstation.com/rma....|`|oPPjGcJVaa	well that happenned to me as well..   it might be the place where you keep it.. it is very very delicate...   maybe the vents didnt have enough space (that was my problem) the solution is to call for assistance or pray that the the warrancy hasnt expired so you can get a new one (that happenned to me)|`|g2BQhmmqaa	just fix it or try to get a new one duhhh|`|37dbkLvEaa	In case of a freeze you always should first try holding down the power button (on the front) for five seconds, and the system will automatically restart. Any other action may (and might have) screwed up your system. Try reformatting your drive, and if that doesn't work, looks like your out of 300 bucks.|`|K3AfzbR8aa	ohhh dude that .....well i dont really know but my friend had a similar problem.....he said that he install a firmware (dont remeber which one)and after a while when he turn it off or it froze.....when he was going to play again the ps3 wouldn't read the blue ray cd....and me and him did some research and we find out that that firmware had some problem and that it could **** up ur ps3 cd drive .......so yea in the end u have two option or send it to sony ...or change the blue ray cd drive     P&L
OJBZJA2Yaa	I would call Direct TV and have them run diagnostics to see whether there is an issue with the box or the smart card.    http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/con...

551b2184eb8b53e521be093fb04e526baa	I talked to one of their Liquidation people that is an overseer and they said that two weeks before they close are when the best deals can be had.  I believe that will be in mid March at our store.  Not sure if that applies to all the stores.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	It would have the manufacturers warranty but no extended warranty. I have been watching and they have yet to make any real discounts. You may want to check out this site http://dealnews.com/  I have no affiliation with them but have found some good sales there. They have different stuff every day.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	They are having sales, however, they are still trying to bring in as much money as they can before they close.  My bf went to the one near us last weekend and didn't find any great deals.  The News Channel said you should compare ads to other companies in order to be sure.  I think they will still have warranties with the manufacturers that will have to be honored.    Good luck!
ouvvS1Ylaa	unless your phone had insurance or was under a warranty,  your not getting a free phone.  you'll have to buy a new one.  i doubt the phone company would send it to you.  you would probs have to wait for the bill.  they definitely wouldnt do it in stores.|`|mxqAOxYRaa	1. I doubt they would do it  2. They would absolutely not
l2E9xlwiaa	You should be able to. I have never bought an mp3 off Amazon but for the mp3s I uploaded to my PC, all I had to do was click file and then something like "Open Folder" and it should just put all the mp3s you have in that folder into your library.    Hope that helps.

UYvgIazcaa	Well first of all, did you move all your music over to the new computer?  And did you tell the installation of iTunes on the new computer where to find that music?  And did the new installation of iTunes then load that music onto your iPod?    It sounds like your new iTunes on your compaq doesn't know you have a ton of music and so it's loading a blank page onto your iPod.    I think you may need to tell it where to find your music.    A quick test of this would be whether or not all your music shows up in iTunes.  If it does, then you'll want to make sure it is supposed to sync up your whole library.  It might possibly be set to only sync up limited selections of your music.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	if you dont have the music on that computer there is nothing to sync
AFy5LyaGaa	yeah all you need is a wireless router connected to your internet modem..    but the router might ask you to insert a disc to your computer to set up the router, im pretty sure it wont download anything on your computer tho..    good luck!!|`|2404nDvSaa	ya|`|Ku0eQTKZaa	The iPod touch uses WIFI (hotspots, routers etc..)

RpCwfcRzaa	No. If you've had any of the software modded so you can play illegally gotten games, you can't play on Live. Once it's been tampered with, you won't be able to connect without being banned even if you remove the changed ware. It's what you get when you try to steal games.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Give Milk best answer, Shes right|`|7kmjybGUaa	Generally, YES! A normal Xbox will check the game disc to verify if it is a genuine article. A modded Xbox simply omits this step, and immediately reads the game information. Microsoft has no way of checking this. There are dangers, however. The only way Microsoft will find out is if there is a "watermark" in the game information, which will only be there if the game were downloaded. Also, Never, Ever, mention on Live that your Xbox is modded. Microsoft loves to eavesdrop on your conversations.

R2Guh69faa	Are you running Windows Vista? If so you may want to try compatibility mode. (To do this right-click on you're game icon, go to properties, then go to the compatibility tab. Look up the games specific requirements and the operating system it was made for, and choose that OS from the selection.) Hope this helps!

Xxviy63Paa	Never ever believe anything you read in a gaming magazine or on a gaming magazine's website. Those guys know nothing, they just tell you what you want to hear so they get paid. Why did they say "price drop?" Because it gets hits on their website, and sells their magazine, so their advertisers pay them. Period.     The cheapest ps3 going is $400 and it's not going to be significantly less than that for at least another year, probably two. Sony would have to suddenly start selling real well for that to happen. They still lose money on each console; the way things are going for them economically, no way will they decide to lose even more money.    Maybe $350 by the end of 2010, if the economy picks up. Maybe.    Ignore all the gaming "critics" and their insidious rumor mill. If nobody listened to them they would have to go get real jobs.    They are the same people who, after all, promised you that Haze and Home would sweep the nation, and who didn't notice Warhawk until it sold over 100,000 in its first week.|`|d381leKpaa	as many people are saying, and have heard, there is going to be a price drop this April by $100. It is still unconfirmed by Sony, but as long as you spread the word to potential buyers of the PS3, people will altogether stop buying PS3's in hope for the price to go down to $299 so Sony will have a very hard time selling, as it is they have sold about 9 million less PS3's than Microsoft has sold Xbox 360's in the past two years or one year? But if the price goes down to $299, you can always buy a used, or preferable a refurbished PS3. The price for a refurbished PS3 (which tons of people have after they sent in their PS3, and Sony just gave them a refurbished one in return) will go down dramatically, to about $200-$250. Which is very cheap for a next Gen gaming console (not including Wii just because it's a piece of crap plastic). But of course this is still just a rumor (but undenied by Sony :D)|`|QIlhmWwBaa	like some people said $299 on april this year    i guess if you are asking to drop to $199? maybe by 2011|`|9sRUf4zEaa	Chances are this isn't going to happen any time soon. maybe in another 1 or 2 year.

pZGLhV2Waa	I would recommend one of the following.    The kit lens 18-55mm. This is a good general purpose lens that will cover you from a moderate wide angle for the landscapes to a slight telephoto for the people. Depending on your budget this is the way to go. It is not the best quality lens but there is a reason that this size is the kit lens with nearly every DSLR out there.     If you have the money the Canon 18-200mm lens is a great all purpose lens. As some of the others have said it may be the only lens you ever need. It goes from a moderate wide angle to a good telephoto length. Good for landscapes to sports and everything in between.    A 50mm F1.4 or F1.8 prime lens is perfect for portraits. It is just the right focal length, very sharp, does very well in low light and gives nice Bokeh (blurred background) on your portraits. Best of all the F1.8 version costs less than $100.    Now there are a million other lenses available and they all have there uses but any of these three will get you off and running. As you practice you will realize what other lenses you may want to pick up in the future.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Probably the most all around best lens you can get right now without spending $1000+ is the Canon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS. It is around $600, but considering you will have to spend that much anyways or more to cover that same focal length in two or more lenses you might as well go for it. It has fairly good optics and is very user friendly in terms of focal length. Good or landscapes, portraits, snapshots and even some sports as long as you have enough light.|`|Y1HJkHdqaa	If your budget can stand a lens in the a little over $500 range, the new Canon 18 to 200 mm EF-S IS lens is the way to go. It may be the only land you will ever need to buy for your camera. I just got one for my XSi and I love it. It's a great zoom  range, very sharp, and extremely flexible.  If that stretches your budget a bit, the 18 to 55 mm EF-S IS lens is probably the best thing to start with. That's a good focal length for taking people pictures and will cover most general photography situations.  Whichever lens you choose, enjoy your new Canon XSi. I use it as my personal camera and it's an excellent picture taker. You'll love it!|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	With the kind of photography you have in mind, I would have opted for a Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 lens (prime).
c94rE8u8aa	I just got the Blitz a few weeks ago and it's a great phone.    Pros: Texting is great on the qwerty keyboard with optional word completion to text even faster... Despite weird shape, it is actually very small and does fit in the pocket... Good looks that always grab the attention of others, even people who have the Dare and Voyager... Keypad/Control Pad is good for playing games... Charges very fast    Cons: Takes a while to get a signal, and I have to turn it on and off several times until it gets bars (even in crowded places where other people get 4 bars.)... Keys are a little small, but unless you have huge fingers they're fine... The screen is slightly off to the left side, if you notice where it says "Slide to Open" on the right side... Average 1.3 megapixels camera with no zoom and can't take videos... No individual number keys because they are shared with letter keys, which makes dialing a number annoying|`|DdOtU7Nyaa	yea i almost got it. its easy to type on, cool, and cute. but it cant take videos.
RxB0ivXoaa	I have an E-300 and E-510. Both work well and I have no complaints at all. I would not suggest the E-500, you would be better off looking at an E-510, E-520 or E-420. These cameras offer some additional features that you will find useful. Individual results vary, as you can read form others.     Olympus does use a smaller sensor than most other companies. This allows them to create the smallest and lightest DSLRs available. Portability should be a factor in looking at cameras. How much good does a camera do if you don't take it with you?    You can get a E-510 or E-420 for around the same price as a Nikon D40. The advantage to Olympuss is that the lens will auto focus (if you want that) and the image stabilization is built in the body, so it works with every lens, even third party lenses with a T mount. You'll get more value from Olympus.     As far as quality goes, Olympus is there with other companies. That's why pros like Jay Dickman (Pulitzer Prize Winner Photographer) and Mitsuaki Iwago (Wildlife photographer who has had his work on the cover of National Geographic) choose them. Olympus is also the fastest growing company in the DSLR market.|`|cUQI6xPUaa	I bought my first DSLR last November 2008. It is a Nikon D60. Before I bought that, I was planning to buy an Olympus E-520 because I was a proud owner of an Olympus C770 UZ (a point and shoot model with manual functions). To cut the story short, I changed my mind for 2 reasons :    1. I posted a question here at Yahoo! Answers. Majority of the answerers suggested that I buy a Nikon.    2. The sensor of a DSLR camera is bigger than that of a point and shoot. However, the sensor of an Olympus DSLR is smaller than that of a Canon or a Nikon DSLR.    The cheapest entry level DSLR that I know is the Nikon D40 (around USD450). I don't have any idea how much an Olympus E-500 costs. I can still see some Olympus E-510 and E-520 being sold here in the Philippines but I haven't seen the E-500.     Anyway, I can say that I am very much satisfied with my Nikon D60.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	i had the E-500. used it for about a year. found out the hard way though that it was'nt that ser friendly. first off the software was'nt that good, limited features and very slow. and had trouble later. when i wanted to learn to shoot in raw format. i ended up trading it in for a canon rebel XS. my new camera is way easier to use. the oly had 276 menus and sub-menus. olympus make pretty good cameras but i'm really happy i moved to canon. their optics are first class. excellent support. i actually got to talk to a real person on the phone. there's a lot of other issues i could talk about but i believe i gave the camera a fair try. good luck with whatever you decide. but i like my canon

If it B on a flash bracket, a cord is absolutely the only way to go.    If the flash B within the reach of the cord length, then it will depend on if you R moving around.  If both camera and flash R in fixed positions, cord B better--more reliable.  If U R moving around, then go wireless.    So, no right way, because it depends on what yor needs R at the time U shoot.
gBkBZNJOaa	it's nothing wrong with the game, you just have to keep improving, you're gonna have to REALLY beat the computer if you wanna get more points and even when you do it won't go up that much... it's kind of annoying but it provides the challenge.|`|LHWeXLJ3aa	In Wii Sports you get skill points for being skilful.  As you gain more points, you need to be more skilful to get more points. Eventually you will hit a point where simply winning isn't good enough, you have to play well. This point comes at about Pro level (1000 points).    In Wii Sports Tennis, this eventually means playing Best of 5, not giving up a single point, and winning pretty much on the serve or the 1st return. In other words, you've got to be flawless, and you've got to be fast.    The same applies to the other sports, especially Boxing, where you almost have to knock them out in less than 10 seconds to break even on the skill points.|`|2VI1EIxbaa	yea you didnt do as well as you have b4 don't worry that just means you had a beasty game before|`|nN3RTESvaa	Well that happens to me all the time, you lose some points when you lose a match or do not as good as you normally do.|`|KBXJeIKtaa	If you mean skill points.

It happens alot to me. lol =)|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Maybe you lost the game or did really bad.|`|iH07L6iDaa	well it means your good man! it means you have to do perfect and not just win but really win!    you sound good when you say that!|`|o8NVWaJgaa	That's because you play it too much. Playing a certain game a lot will actually subtract points sometimes if you always play and always win a lot. So try not to play, Wii Tennis in your case, a lot.

Although a 35 mm point and shoot camera may meet the requirements, I believe they also meant SLR type camera, they have interchangeable lenses. The typical camera for these classes is the Canon Rebel 2000 with 28-80 mm lens, they are on craigslist for $80-120 and ebay wins around similar, maybe better as the supply is greater than the demand. Lots of people buy this camera for a photography class and then sell it a couple years later, and they do not wear out in that time. Make sure it comes with the manual, or be prepared to spend the $15 to get the Magic Lantern guide for it. I have this camera as backup so I know for sure it has manual shutter speed and aperture settings, I have taken some real nice pictures with it using manual settings. You may want to find out who is in the class now, and see about purchasing their camera from them after the class. The first link is to the 2000 on Amazon to read about it; the second link is for keh.com a good seller of used equipment; this 2nd link is to the bodies, towards the 6th page are the 2000's. Every camera on those pages meet the minimum requirements. The third link is for the lenses, you are looking for the 28-80 in EXcellent condition for about $50.     There you go that should be enough to get your started and then some.

pmSHKJSPaa	Hi  I assume you have tried to clean the camera with a head cleaning tape.  If not try a an official head cleaning tape. If you don't have one of those tapes try going to an area of the tape where there is no recording and record over it for 10 seconds or so. Then try you previous recording and try to view and difference, If that doesn't work try putting the camera in playback mode push the play button and then run the camera in the rewind. In other words while the tape head is spinning put the camera in rewind. Your playback heads are clogged.   If and when you do get it fixed always use the same tape (do not switch between tape brands) and don't use the same tape more than 3 times. Do not use this tape anymore that had clogged your camera heads. Always use your camera in the SP speed (fastest speed) not the slowest speed. ....Tom G ....bravotom@yahoo.com|`|kSyiUxYSaa	Samsung support page for that unit:    http://www.samsung.com/us/support/search...

znLzOCHlaa	maxell's are the best|`|AA10690306	Neither is that good but Memorex will last longer than Sony.  The oxide layer in the Sony cd-r's is too light sensitive and will fail in less than a year if exposed to too much light.  Memorex made good audio tape but their cd-r's were made too cheaply.  If I were you I would buy a store brand or check locally on other brands.    I agree with ImFinna|`|Zj98QaECaa	I would say Sony, many of their products are well made but they seem to be more expensive than most other brands like Memorex. If you want the best quality you can get in my opinion, it would be Sony. Memorex is a very good alternative though and almost just as good for the prices. Hope this helps.
tueHUkoTaa	Yeah, with digital camcorders, pixelation can sometimes be an issue with rapid camera movement. Yes, it happens with others cameras, too, but with some more than others.    Also, Youtube compresses videos when you upload them,which may make the pixelation look more severe.

From there, you can drag them to wherever you want them. You can move them to different pages by dragging them to the right (or left, if you want them on a previous page).

AQ4b4Iilaa	Canon has the best high ISO results.  It has the best sensor for low-light.    Any good camera will give you a continuous 3fps and a "moving effect".    Depending what you want to photograph at night, you'll need a lens with a wide aperture (low "f" number).  My Sony 50mm f1.4 is fantastic at night, I'd be taking pictures with my Sony A200 and 50mm f1.4 lens long after other people have put their zoom lenses away for the night :)    A tripod with a zoom lens on a slow shutter will help a lot at night.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Canon Rebel XSi 12.2 MP with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens   12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor ,Large 3.0-inch LCD display,DIGIC III image processor provides fast, accurate image processing; improved Autofocus and framing rate ,EOS Integrated Cleaning system, plus Dust Delete Data Detection in included software ,3.5 fps continuous shooting http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA...  or Nikon D40 with 2 lens http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDP...|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.

Good luck!|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Well what your describing pretty much fits an DSLR out there except possibly taking pictures outside at night. That is very tough to do. Anything in your price range is not going to do that so well since ISO 800-3200 will be needed depending on ambient light or possibly higher. Your best bet is probably a Nikon D80 or Canon XSi with a 50mm f/1.8 lens. You will need that aperture for night shots. Its also a good focal length for portraits. Still though your pictures are going to be very noisy at those ISO especially in the dark.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Any of the entry level DSLR's are capable of doing most of what you want if you know how to use them. From your list.    Intense color: This can be achieved by either boosting the saturation and vibrance in the camera or in any editing program.    Speed: They will all shoot at 3 to 4 frames per second. Not fast for a DSLR but much much quicker than the average point and shoot.    Moving objects: This has to do with the shutter speed you use. Generally to freeze action you need a shutter speed of at least 1/250th of a second. The faster the better. Depending on the available light and the lens you use this can't always be achieved. Outdoors on a sunny day you will have no problem but indoors you will. If there is not enough light you wont be able to get the proper exposure and your pictures will be dark. Action shots are usually taken with fast large aperture lenses and at higher ISO's.    Now you can certainly take pictures outside at night with any camera but you need to realize that you either have to use a flash or use a tripod with a long exposure. Exposure time for night shots can be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes depending on the available light. Also any movement at all will cause blurring. You can't expect to get clear photos of your friends at night without a flash. The same would be true if you were to spend 10x your budget.     All that said I would look at the following cameras. Cost is just under $500 with a 18-55mm lens. For $700 you should be able to get a package with an additional telephoto lens.    Canon Rebel XS or Nikon D40

21aec64f527a880df5515fae2f3be31caa	The facebook app for iPhone is free (not ALL iphone apps are free, but that one IS)      Also, you can visit ANY website with the iPhone, using the included 'Safari' web browser - however be aware that not all plugins work (stuff like Adobe Flash, for instance).   That's why there's a separate YouTube app, also free and included with the iPhone.    If you get the unlimited data plan (don't think there's a choice on that) you are not charged for your web use.    The iPhone includes a free email client, and it can connect with any POP or IMAP email service.   Setup is very easy.    The iPhone does not come with any kind of case or belt clip, so you might want to pick one up.   I recommend the Sena leather case - very nice.    You'll need to install iTunes on your computer (whether Windows or Mac) to allow your computer to communicate with your iPhone - thankfully, it's a free download.
d381leKpaa	So if you don't care which one is cheaper, get the PS3. But here's the great deal, if you wait for April, which is only two months away, you can buy a PS3, after a new price cut. It is still not confirmed, or denied by Sony, but people are saying that there will be a $100 price cut for the PS3. PS3, will also last the longest, the Wii, is just a piece of plastic, and not very good graphics or anything. And the Xbox 360 has the Red Rings of Death, the most common failure in the Xbox. It also has about either a 3% or 30% chance of failure in one way or another, i can't remember, but anyway most people end up on their 5th or so Xbox, and switch over to a PS3. PS3 also has either a 3% or 0.3% chance of failure, i think it's 0.3% tho. So so far, even though you have stated that you don't care, the PS3 is tied price with the 360, and $30 more than the Wii (which sucks). It also lasts longest... lets see what else it does...      The PS3 has the best graphics ever on a Console. If you look at the game "Killzone 2" (PS3) and compare the graphics to the game "Halo 3"(Xbox 360) the game Killzone 2 is actually better. Halo is probably the top end of Xbox's games, and will be for a long period of time. However, the PS3 has stated that Killzone 2 is only using a small part of the potential of power for the PS3. The Wii, is full of cartoon games, and is not realistic at all... The PS3 also has a built in Blue-ray player, which is much better than a normal DVD. This allows it to have the better graphics. The Blue-ray player can also play Blue Ray movies, which is a newer technology then DVD's. The Wii has no DVD player, or Blue-ray player. The Xbox 360 can play HD games, but to play movies i think you need to buy an add-on which is a few hundred dollars (100-300 i'm not sure).     The PS3 internet is called PSN standing for (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork.  It is free to use, and also has a store (which costs money to buy games or game add-ons) and the game Home. Home is a game that you can download for free as well, and you can talk to your friends using characters (aviators). Playstation Network is where you can play games like call of duty and games like that (whatever game) with your friends, on the Xbox 360 it is called Xbox Live. Xbox live costs 80 Dollars for the first year, and 50 for the next year, and fifty for all following years each. The wii has nothing like that at all, you don't see who your even playing against.  So, as you can see the PS3 is undoubtedly the best buy. I hope i could swing your vote :D|`|lcy7F8izaa	i would go with the arcade because its cheap $199 and the pro is $299 and the elite is $399|`|QIlhmWwBaa	i would go for the pro which is 299   i have the elite but the pro would be just good enough and you should get xbox live for sure   a lot of friends from college that are girls also own  the xbox 360 and they all have the pro also|`|VcNHahtgaa	Since you don't care about what is cheaper, PS3 is the real deal, even if you do care about money PS3 is better.    PS3:  FREE online  FREE internet browser  More variety of exclusives.    Also, the 2009 exclusive lineup is greatly PS3 superior.

Xbox 360: it can do basically the same things that the PS3 can. It can play music while you are playing games. IDK if the PS3 can. It has a bit better graphics than the PS3 (At least, by my experience). The PRO is what I have and I can't see myself getting a Elite. Don't get a CORE or Arcade 360, as they can't do half the things as the Elite or PRO.     2. PS3: Can do basically the same things as the 360, but it also has PS Home. You can also browse the web on it too. (Unlike the 360, which can't)    3. Wii: Is very fun to play and is about half the size of the 360 in it's vertical position. The multiplayer is hard to set up. (We spent 3 hrs trying to figure out DS suitcase at my birthday party.) It can also browse the web.    Good luck!|`|vs3vz6lIaa	well if i were you i think you would like to re think your decision and go for the PlayStation 3 because it is a blue-ray player and normal DVD player better sound better graphics also i think it has better games besides halo also you can download movies pics music then go on the internet has a stronger Wi-Fi then 360 also in some games it has this thing where you can tilt push pull and turn the controller and it responds like in warhawks or any kind of game if you tilt it you move left or right forward backwards and also it has Home beta meaning you have a huge virtual community where you can connect and meet new friends and also make your own space also when you get a game you download it once to the system that it works a lot faster and loadsa lott faster then X-Box 360 so i would go for the PS3 and also allsystemss have percents of failure and the PS3 only has .03% of failure when the X-Box 360 has a way more chance of 30% so that makes the PS3 faster better does more and even looks better in graphics and also the systems design

7kmjybGUaa	Did you install it to your Hard Drive? I know that Microsoft warns you not to install Halo, because it will actually be slower, seeing as it was designed to be played off the disc. The same may be occurring to you.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	It's not lagging. Lagging is when there's a connection problem. Because Oblivion is such a huge game with so much content, the disk and your hard drive have a hard time keeping up with each other. You'll notice it will freeze for a second and then your disk will spin really quickly to catch up and you can see where textures aren't popping up and stuff like that. There's not much you can do about it though. It just happens with games of that size.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	LOL the other person was talking about halo and you didnt ask about it...      What do you mean?

LCD:  Lighter  Brighter - best for brightly lit rooms or rooms that have lots of natural light  More energy efficient  Poorer viewing angle - picture degrades as you move sideways away from the tv.  More expensive in larger sizes  Doesn't display dark scenes as well  Motion blur can be a problem, but not as bad as earlier generations  No burn in problems  More easily damaged screen    Plasma:  Heavier  Not as bright - less suitable for brightly lit rooms or rooms with lots of natural light.  Less energy efficient and runs hotter  Wide viewing angle  Less expensive in larger sizes  Displays dark scenes better  No motion blur  Subject to burn in, but not as bad as earlier generations  More durable screen    Many don't know it, but LCD screens are more subject to damage.

You'll see what I mean.|`|HhHptzbnaa	HDTV isn't really a type of tv, its a capability, most tvs that come out now are HD ready. To determine if you get a high definition signal you need to get hd cable or something. Plasmas are made of glass, so if you have a window that shines on your tv, you will get reflection. Plasmas usually have a more real color to them. LCDs tend to be brighter, it depends on what you think a good picture is. Some people prefer a brighter pic. LCDs tend to be better for video games. It used to be the case where plasmas would get burn in (where the image is burnt onto the screen) but that isn't anymore. Just make sure you get a reliable brand|`|Zj98QaECaa	You can find that information on this site: By the way- Plasmas, LCD's and DLP tvs are all HDTV's.  http://www.crutchfield.com/S-HYK6fwvljbY...|`|iLTlJszaaa	LCD's are more energy-efficient while having a greater brightness, and are smaller and lightweight, but they are prone to dead pixels (which cannot be fixed), not-so-great contrast, slow response time, and input lag (the latter two mean there may be a slight delay on the screen versus what's going on in the game or broadcast).  Furthermore, if you're viewing an LCD TV at an angle (i.e. aren't sitting right in front of it), you won't see the screen clearly, and colors might even appear incorrectly.    Plasmas have excellent black depth and contrast, and are fairly versatile and lightweight (though not as much so as LCD's), but are also prone to possibly input lag.  Their brightness may also be limited, and they can suffer from phosphor burn-in if something is displayed on the screen for a long time without changing (such as a score indicator in the corner of the screen on a video game).  Plasmas usually only come in relatively large screen sizes and tend to be costly.    CRT's (traditional tube TV's) have excellent contrast and pretty good brightness, and have very quick response times, which make them good for fast-action video games.  Like plasmas, they can be viewed from a wide angle without distortion, but models with curved screens (flat screen models are usually slightly more expensive) may show minor distortion in the shapes and sizes of objects, especially towards the edges of the screen.  CRT's have no native resolution, and can usually tolerate input from a wide variety of resolutions, which means that you can usually watch analog TV, digital TV, VHS videos, DVD's, Blu-Ray discs, and play video games, without seeing excessive blurriness in any of them, which you may encounter among LCD's or plasmas that are displaying content in their "non-native resolutions."  The main drawbacks of CRT's are their larger depth, heavy weight, limited screen size (you'll be hard-pressed to find a non-projection model over 36"), and limited availability at some major electronics retailers.  But CRT's are usually the least-expensive type of television.    There are also front-projectors for very large screens, but they tend to be expensive and require a dark room and large specially-painted wall or projector screen.    DLP's are another type of television, but are not yet common except at larger screen sizes, and although they display a great image, they tend to be pricey and have a back light that needs to be replaced every year or so (except in the case of LED back-lit models, but even then LED's can fail)    HDTV means "high-definition television," which is displayed at a higher resolution and color depth than EDTV (enhanced-definition television) and standard-definition television.  In my opinion HDTV isn't all it's cracked up to be, but many people are willing to spend the extra money for the more vivid picture.    If you're going to be playing a lot of video games, my recommendation would be to go with a flat-screen CRT television, or if you can afford a larger screen, a HD plasma.  But the choice is yours.
QIlhmWwBaa	no  they are just for pc   hopefully they would come out for consoles soon

CKRfaRYvaa	You can only trade the phone for a different make/model within the first 30 days, and then only if the phone is in new condition.  And from what you've said, the phone is damaged, not defective.  Therefore, unless you have insurance they will not replace the phone at all.  However, they may be able to offer a discount on purchasing a new phone, but it will not be as big a discount as you got when you bought the Voyager.|`|p6viL2Bmaa	Depends on how the screen broke.  If it just stopped working and you can convene them of that, and that your unhappy with the Voyager, they may let you.  You would have to pay the difference between the phone prices and taxes.  If the screen was broken by misuse, then they will probably not let you trade.  I had the Samsung Glyde and the screen was defective so I traded it for another, and it messed up to.  So I traded it in for the Voyager.  I would suggest you call up customer service and talk to them.  If you go to a Verizon Store, it will be up to the store manager as to where they allow you to trade or not.  And they will probably inspect the phone thoroughly.
H90uflbFaa	same thing happened to mine & 5 other people i know. ask them and see what they can do. if it comes down to you havingt to buy a new phone just use the inside.|`|OsFItDnPaa	they will replace it with another enV2 if an enV2 breaks three times they give you a voyager
CKRfaRYvaa	No, pix are treated the same as texts.  The only exception would be if you were on one of their really old plans from 6 or 7 years ago, but those plans didn't have an unlimited option, so I think you're safe.  :)
lAP3UC79aa	hifi ringtones are the ones that sounds like the real song, with the artist voice and all, and the megatones are the sounds.
GJFIIE63aa	This happened to me once. I entered the wrong pin number a few times and it locked up. Once I borrowed a friend's phone and called t-mobile, they helped me unlock it in less than 5 minutes. Good luck.|`|lAP3UC79aa	go to t-mobile, sidekick's only work with t-mobile, also maybe the sim card thats inside the sidekick is not a t-mobile sim card.
ny4ymBxSaa	Hold the home key and lock button on the top down until the apple appears on the screen.|`|1b7b0c50f4f9a04e8d5f6bd1aa6bb84baa	If you connect it to your computer, and open up ITunes, there might be a button for "reseting."  Try that.
AVzQs5Uhaa	depends if your phone has a sim card you just transfer your sim card from your old phone to the new one, just make sure you have your numbers stored to your sim card. If not if your phone came with a usb hook up for your computer you might be able to transfer them to your computer then back to your new phone  if  it is capable of that feature. If none then you have to manually program them in. Sometimes in the mall they have stores that you can take your phone to and they can retrieve the numbers, I would contact your local sprint store or deal or local cell phone shop. But if your phone is not working and does not have a sim card, you will most likely lose your numbers. I wish you luck!
lAP3UC79aa	rubbing alcohol, it takes off almost everything. and the nail palish remover will damage the real color of the phone.|`|1NIp8eH7aa	hmm you could try nail polish remover (nail varnish remover) and like if it comes off wipe it off with water right away and dont like scrub hard.       if the paint comes off just repaint it with nail polish|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	definitely alcohol, that will work
hlAJEO0waa	u just got to plug it up to ur computer and it will unlock it for u|`|joijxHCXaa	go 2 where she went and set it different|`|PSvc3sLdaa	hook it up to ur computer and restore it using itunes  shud work then|`|8cLLhDrfaa	try resetting your ipod.|`|5Z0OtSIQaa	ask her for it lol  or you could ask her to write a code again because she might write the same one|`|7wInwqkAaa	hook it up to your computer and reset it using your i tunes. that should work but if not sorry.. your gonna have to try every possible  
1ayX5jmsaa	you will not be charged for the messenger or im because it is included in the unlimited text package. I am not sure if you will be charged for texting someone in the phillipines but you might want to call Tmobile before you do to avoid a huge phone bill.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	no cuz its included|`|lAP3UC79aa	i don't think they will charge you for aim or any messenger as long as you have unlimited texts, but i think they will charge to text a different country.|`|WiPpLnVBaa	No. I have a blackberry pearl, and yahoo Messenger was already installed. I asked the people that worked there and they said no. They charge instant messages as text messages.
AVzQs5Uhaa	What they do is prorate the bill, so on your coming bill you will see the prorated rate for the 300 texts( it will be a little less then what you pay for the 400) and then you will see the charge for the 1000 txt bundle. This should only show up on one bill as the changes usually take in 24hrs or less with tmobile. So on the bull after that one you should only see the charge for the 1000 bundle and not the 400 or 300 one.|`|1ayX5jmsaa	when you make the change it automatically takes effect, they will pro rate your usage of text so you will see part of the amount charged for the 400 texts and part of the 1000 text.|`|N5r494Craa	lol chicken noodle soup.

Don't wait, you've got to do it now!|`|Bk1ZQpcNaa	If you see him with it, punch him in the arm and take your machine back.    Then take the headphones he gave you and choke him with them.

M9YNvbraaa	If the phone is on back order, that means that they are out of stock. If the supplier also has none in stock they have to go to the manufacturer-if that is the case usually no definite date can be given.  An expected date can usually only be given if the store itself is out of stock- they know when they receive their deliveries-but it is a lot more unpredictable if the supplier has no inventory,particularly if the phone is in large demand and they do not no how many back orders the supplier has to fill.  I know if must be frustrating to have to wait so long, especially when you have been expecting the phone for a long time..  Your only other option might be to call around to other stores to see if they have any in supply- but if you made a deposit on the phone to the store you ordered it from- you may lose your deposit, check with them first.  If you did not order from a local store but ordered from your service provider, then of course likely no deposit was required and you are free to check with retailers.  Or if you ordered from a local store, then you may be able to check either with your service provider through either their toll free customer service number or their on line site to see if the phone is available there.  Since on-line, customer service and local stores get their inventory through different channels- one of them may have it when the other channels  do not I hope this helps|`|1ayX5jmsaa	they should of provided you with an exact date of shipment. I had to wait for two weeks for my daughters phone to arrive since it was also on backorder.
lAP3UC79aa	a prepaid t-mobile or at&t phone.|`|6ZiIw4ugaa	iphone|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	A 12 year old doesn't need a phone.    At 12 I could barely get my parents to buy me shoes.  Now kids are getting $400 phones?  That should set up some realistic expectations.

Vd7UrgHzaa	Sorry about losing your phone - been there, done that!  Call your friend who you got a lift home with - they could check their car floor incase it dropped out your blazer.   If no joy, then go back to where you were playing in the snow as early as you can. If the snow has melted it may just be on the ground.   The phone will more than likely be broken, but there is a tiny chance that the SIM card will still be fine which could save you a few pounds when buying a new handset.  Restep your footsteps up to the point that you last saw your phone, and dont leave a stone unturned!  Good luck!|`|VSPzefpQaa	your not responsible or you should have bought a pouch for it
1ayX5jmsaa	I had to wait for two weeks when i ordered it back in December 25th and i got it January 7th. Give them a call back and tell them to give you an exact date of shipment. I called twice until they finally told me when it was to arrive.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	It's going to be awhile! right now there is not estimated time
lAP3UC79aa	i pay like 67 sometimes, it depends if i go over, but i have the 5 faves and unlimited data|`|vXa7IeDiaa	i have a sidekick lx..i pay $97 a month...    You should try and buy a sidekick then get on the flex pay plan..You just pay the same amount each month..my lil sister has a sidekick slide and she is on the flex pay plan her bill is  $70 a month|`|QJHE3z1raa	i just got it for christmas;  so the bill went up a little.    my dad has the G1 and has the 34.99 a month  and i have the sidekick 08 with 34.99 a month  plus my brother with the blackberry curve and 14.99 for unlimited texting    so altogether its:    $194.95    we have the 2000 minutes (;
yaXYt2GIaa	depends on the features that you are looking for in a phone.     ps if u chose an iphone get it in pink!!!!    voyager is ok|`|3rIvTvq2aa	the voyager. the iphone has too many attachments to it that you dont need.  one of my friend has the voyager and she says she loves it. the other has the iphone and she doesnt liek it.|`|lAP3UC79aa	apple sucks, and the LG Voyager kicks ***, u should get it.
lJAaBmlyaa	It's not an old phone Tmobile just didn't make them for that long... a sidekick id or sidekick 3 is an old phone|`|lAP3UC79aa	well since t-mobile no longer sells it, then yeah its a little old, but no need to buy a new phone just cause its not new anymore.
vXvNeGIjaa	LG DARE: Texting is really hard at first. But my friend says that you eventually get used to it.  EnV2: terrible phone. Don't even waste your time  I have the Samsung glyde. I hate it! It always messes up and its way too sensitive. But my friend told me that I should have gotten a screen protector. If i would have gotten that, it would be a great phone.|`|ZWaRNMzVaa	I have the enV2 and I luv it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  All my friends want it!!  And since u txt alot it is also a good fone!  I would recommend the enV2 or Samsung Alias....my friend has that fone  and she likes the keyboard (if u like small letters get the alias.......if u like big letters get the enV2)|`|QJHE3z1raa	voyager = love 
qGfAlDd2aa	All we will do is turn off the analog channels.  What you have for digital now you will still have.|`|HTXbLqBIaa	Hi,  I assume you're living in USA and I hear about the DTV switch everyday hear in Canada. I get some American channels with my HD package from my cable company. I would assume your over the air HD channels will stay since they are part of DTV (Digital television). HD channels are broadcasted in digital signal right? And you know this since you have your antenna hooked up to DTV tuner of your tv right?  Here in Canada, we're not doing the switch over yet but its comming soon. Your lucky to get free HD over the air, in Canada I have to have a settop box to recieve HD either via cable or satellite. The over tha air channels are all analog here in Canada.   So I would not worry since over the air HD is still DTV.  Good luck and enjoy HD!|`|gra0KsHRaa	Your "-1, -2" channels will stay, the cable company have been broadcasting in digital for some time now. You will only lose the analog non "-" channels when the transition happens. Like i said, they have been sending this signal out nationwide for a few years now, they are just forcing them to turn off the analog signal later this month.       Ex.. You get 3 and 3-1/3-2...when they transition you will only get 3-1 and 3-2...the regular 3 will be turned off for government usage
dpTzuFWFaa	Txts should automatically save to your sim card.
ibpoLakuaa	tell your mom that you need it just in case of an emergency. it really does come in handy more then parents think so. you could always use it if you need to be picked up from school or if something happens. it's always a good thing to have a cellphone on you once you are old enough to be responsible with it but seeing as you really want one i'm sure you will take care of it.    good luck!|`|4qAcCZ8Jaa	ok, $10 a month is to add a line to your moms contract with everything she has on her contract (minutes txts, etc ) shared with you. to get unlimited texting for you would be $20 a month and for the whole family &30 a month. if you see it comes out to 80 you must have added data and that would be a huge waist of money. i recomend first statrting out w/ a prepaid and then a year or so down the road once you've proven your responsible (don't get your phone taken for texting is a good way) then get a nice phone on a plan. good luck.|`|32E2SvPAaa	Say your growing up and you need the bear necessities so you can be successful. Also say it will help you if your alone and there is buglers.|`|c94rE8u8aa	I hate to be negative, but I think you've been mislead several times:    .: $10 a month is for adding a line to a current contract  .: You need to open up a 2-year contract to get the Pearl for free  .: If your plan is $80 a month, you're looking at a big cell phone bill, so don't get the "bells and whistles" and all the dumb features like mobile web, GPS, and AIM  .: Verizon has a $15/month unlimited data plan, which basically covers all the hidden charges of when you download a game/ringtone, go on the media center and mobile web, and use certain features. Make sure to talk to a Verizon salesman about this.    I think the best thing for you to do is talk to a Verizon salesman before making up numbers out of the blue. Once you get a price, then start saving up your money and offer to pay for everything, and make sure you won't be short on money when the bill comes around and force them to pay. Do not break or lose your phone or your charger. Maybe pick up some chores and tell them you won't go over your minutes, text limits. Also tell them it is good to have if you're ever lost, in an emergency, missed the bus etc.    Tips: 1. The cheapest way to get a phone is through a 2-year contract  2. If you get bored of your phone after the first year of the contract, you can buy an INACTIVE phone on eBay and have Verizon switch the service.  3. Find out if the people you are going to call and text the most have Verizon, because you can save money by getting a texting, calling plan that gives unlimited to Verizon users but a limit to other carriers. For example, all my friends have Verizon so I saved money by getting an unlimited texts to Verizon users/500 to anyone else plan instead of unlimited to any carrier.|`|wevao7Jeaa	Its actually better not to have a cell phone.one because it gives off radiation that cause cancer,but two,if you have a cell phone they always know where you are and that sucks ecpecially when your with friends and they constantly call. If you really want a cell phone anyway you have to be really sweet to your mom and do what ever she tells you to do.If that doesnt work then barely talk for two weeks and do all of the stuff you are supposed to do ,like chores, flawlessly so she really gets the picture                                                                                             .P.S Don't worry about ur friends,who cares|`|TGeTsqVoaa	First of all, at 13 don't you think you are being a little bit extravagant wanting a Blackberry? I think it would should more responsibility to your Mom if you were to start out with something a little more practical.  If your Mom already has a plan and 1 additional plan, THEN it'll be only $9.99 to add on, HOWEVER, just having a Blackberry adds $30 because you need a data plan AND You and your Mom have to be on the same plan so if your Mom is not on a data plan, then you'll have to get your own plan, so you are looking at $30 for a Basic Voice Plan and an additional $30 for Data. Thats $60 before anything else, like unlimited text, etc...  Your Mom knows that if you default on paying the bill, she is on the hook for that, times 2 because if she lets you get one, she'll have to let your sister get one. I would suggest starting out with something practical, You and your sister should get something basic so its only $10 per line add-on and then you can also get unlimited text.(which will come to much less than $80 a month. Show responsibilty with your phone and paying the bill, then revisit it with her after she sees that you can be trusted.  There are alot of chargers
KhHH8Ddiaa	Haha.    Ok. once you insert the memory card in the computer, and open the memory cards folder. than you will be erasing the photos from there.  That means that, you'll be deleting them from your camera too. Its just the same thing if you delete them from the camera.      IF and only IF, you import the pictures to your computer, and you delete them, then you wont be deleting them from your memory card.   But once again, thats just when you import(copy) them into the computer..|`|IQZxdghGaa	nope, you killed them off the memory card|`|pmSHKJSPaa	The computer see the memory card as a storage device....just like it sees a hard drive or a jump drive (memory stick).  The computers "autoplay" program or softwear that you previously loaded on your computer should have come up on your computer when it saw the memory card. The autoplay program or other softwear should have asked you what you want to do. It probably gave you an option to move them or copy them to the computer hard drive. If it did not you can perform this operation with the Explorer program. When the computer saw the memory card it assigned a drive letter to it and if you look at "MY Computer" you will see what letter it was assigned.  You can also look at what is on the card at this point and see if any photos are still on the card .....Tom Gietzen bravotom@yahoo.com|`|m0hvyQicaa	If you delete them from where they are without saving the pictures as something else, then they should also be deleted from the memory card.  That is what has happened in my experience with them at least!|`|AA10020760	It is most likely gone from everywhere.|`|50Opi2wFaa	You can do it either way..Delete it from the computer or if you want,delete from the camera its your choice. just copy and paste them to your computer and delete the ones you don't like|`|3mFoOWTkaa	You should be able to delet it from your camera.

tueHUkoTaa	480i is just standard definition. Although, yes, it would still look extremely great on a normal tv like yours, compared to a standard DVD player.    1080i is not HD, it is the highest resolution for standard-class tv's. HDTV resolutions are: 480p, 720p, & 1080p. Although 480p is almost unheard of for HDTV's, you will always see the latter two.    Yes, an HDMI cable does improve picture quality if you're using HD-compatible hardware (for instance, an HDTV, Blu-Ray player, or a compatible DVD player).|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	480i means that's the best resolution you can get.  Upscaling and progressive scan DVD players can only improve the picture if you have a picture that can be improved.  I'm sorry, but that's not going to happen until you get a new TV.|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	Blu ray would not be worth it for you until you upgrade your TV.    A regular DVD player hooked up with an HDMI cable would look the same as your blu ray on your tv.    Once you get at least a 720p or higher TV then a blu ray will look better.|`|aJRjOXpwaa	It's all limited to the ability of your tv. You can buy all the stuff and cables you want, until yo upgrade your tv you will continue to watch everything in 480i. It will not matter what kind of dvd or blu ray player you have. At this time, do not buy a blu ray unless you are planning to upgrade your television.|`|0IWZXeL9aa	It would look ok...The dvd player with the HDMI cable would probably look better than a basic dvd player that does not upconvert...you really need at least 720p, with an upconverting DVD player(w/ HDMI) to look pretty darn good.....

RyvKws7Laa	Samsung is one of the best, if not the best, brand of LCD.  They make excellent panels and have a great reputation for image quality.  I think its a solid choice.  I would prefer if the response time was a bit better than 8ms (like 5 or less), but that's not the end of the world.    I'm not sure you'll beat the price unless you find something being liquidated somewhere.  This is Wal-Mart we're talking about here, they are pretty hard to beat in prices (again minus some heavy handed sales somewhere).|`|iLTlJszaaa	http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...

AA10533811	1. Open Itunes  2. Connect your USB cord to your iPod and to the USB port of your computer  3. On the right where it says Library, Movies, TV Shows and Etc, there should be a button that says "your name's IPod" click on that.  4. On the blue tabs that say: Summary, Music, Movies & Tv Shows, click on the blue tab that says Music  5.  Select your options and click sync.  6. However, if you would like to pick your songs you can manually manage your music and select or deselect the songs you want on your iPod. If you would like to deselect songs go back to your music page that can be found on your library page and deselect the check mark.  7. Once your songs are done syncing, your iPod will say it Ok to disconnect. Once you see that on the screen, you can take the plug out.

So for less than $50 bucks you can have a functional Xbox 360 console. When purchasing a broken console make sure the seal hasn't been broken or the towel trick used on it.|`|gzFYV9khaa	If your Xbox 360 is still under warranty, you should send it back to Microsoft.

If you send it in to the x-box people they fix it and send it back no charge. I don't know the address but im sure its on the site.

The EnV2 is another great phone for text messaging (Dare not so much), but the Voyager is a better choice.  Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|8EwwSlZ6aa	K, I have the Dare.  I've had it since it very very first came out and initially it had quite a few problems but they've done a good job working out the kinks.  If you do get it make sure it has the latest software version V06 -   I think its a better choice cos it has a better browser, html capable, easier to view, a TON more fun.  Once you get the hang of it, it is just as easy if not easier than typing on a hard qwerty.  ummm...what is bad?

lWWJ80vLaa	I have a 4th generation iPod Nano and the way it works for most games is you actually turn your iPod sideways and the game is played sideways. You can flip it either way though. Although for some games (like the maze game for instance), it's played normally. It really depends on the game though.    Hope this helps!
wlOUQIRjaa	I had a similar problem. If you look at Apple's website, the flashing orange means it's "ready for disc access".    Why apple decided to not have it charging at this stage is beyond me, but if you start up iTunes, it should switch over to the charging light.    Hope it works for you.|`|AA12180617	See ?http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1369 for USB power issues    as likely its a USB power issue.

Leave it charging on this for at least an hour before proceeding further.    make sure you have the latest itunes 8.0.2 (downloaded on your PC from www.apple.com/itunes/download then restart PC first)  and reset the ipod before connection (menu and centre key till screen blanks then connect once it lights up).    the say YES to the 'pair with this computer' Message    you do not say if this is new ipod or an older one.. if after doing the USB power check you still have problems you need to call apple for a swap for replacement... as batteries can be killed by improper usage apple has a page at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1726  that tells you how to get the most from your battery|`|f56f3c9919da34a0a923008473053c53aa	has it been flashing before, or during charging?    if during, you might not be charging properly. check power source and connection. your charger may be spoilt. if you can have another to test that will be great. (check the equipment before you conclude its the ipod's problem)    if flashing before.. hmm.. not sure.. maybe it is the ipod's problem.. i do remember i have flashing laptop battery.. you might not want to hear it, but for me the conclusion was: change a new battery..

kOepMcXeaa	yes you can download from dvd, but to do that you need to download two programs, one that rips/decrypts dvds and one that converts that file to a ipod format video file.    here are the sites to download the two i use  (whole process takes like an hour for a two hour movie)    dvd ripper  http://www.softpedia.com/get/CD-DVD-Tool...  converter  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/3GP_Conve...    all you do is put a dvd in and rip the longest vob file using the ripper.  Open the 3gp converter, which originally is in japanese, change the language to english(its self explanitory when you get to it) and select to convert to MP4 for ipod.  Select your quality(better quality longer wait) and drag the vob file into the window.  then just wait a little and you have a movie that plays on ipods.    P.S. i use 384kbps quality, but a touch ipod's screen may have better resolution, so you might want to go with 600kbps.
a2ZUE0U5aa	you could try a manual reset on the playstation. Hold the power button down until you hear 2 beeps. That will reset it and after that when it turns back on it will ask you if you want to use the hdmi out. Choose yes and that should fix the problem.     Good Luck..

Then, no it's only for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Sorry no. Only on the PS3 and Xbox 360.  I wish it did...|`|gBkBZNJOaa	this question get's asked lots of times in this section. i've never played COD: WAW and idk what nazi zombies are (i'm guessing some kind of excruciatingly hard game mode) but judging by the answers i've seen i'm pretty sure it doesn't have it.
qGfAlDd2aa	There should be warranty papers with the unit.   Sometimes the warranty is printed on a page of the owners manual.  The warranty will have instructions on how to file a claim.|`|EeQLKiwLaa	Circuit City name and business is no longer.  They are gone so the stores left are liquidating which means no returns/exchanges.  But you should be covered under the manufacturer for the first year.  A problem like that is definately covered.    Problems like this is definately NOT why circuit city went out of business.  Try doing a little research before posting like an uninformed idiot.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	This is the reason why Circuit City is closing down in the first place|`|yunnKBGsaa	did you try this number 1-888-319-9464|`|bUl9xpbkaa	OMG!!! i just bought a Tv last night, it worked fine for 8 hours then it shut down and will not come back on. ive called all numbers and cant get any help. im so upset!!!! i dont know what to do!!!!help

AA11307345	Hi,  I would like that too, a digital book. But unfortunately, nobody has released any programs with an archive of books (if it were created by one company, it would cost a lot to pay the royalty money to use their books.) Also, if there were to be something like this, it wouldn't be an official Sony UMD, it would be homebrew:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation...    which requires a custom firmware or firmware 1.50 to run:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation...    You may want to do this though:  1. Search up a desired book on the internet.  2. Go to here: http://www.pspdemocenter.org/page.php?id...  3. On your PSP, visit that page and follow the Offline Version instructions if preferred.  4. Create a .txt file with Notepad or Wordpad.  5. Copy and paste all of the text from the story into the TXT file.  6. Format the text as wanted (chapters).  7. Save the file into your E:\PSP\COMMON\.  8. Go into your PSP and use the page above to launch the file.  9. Your txt file is now on your PSP for you to read.    That's what I do anyways.    Hope that helped!

EWuVYSOXaa	You can still send the message to your friend via mms.  Even though the iPhone isn't mms capable she will get a text with a login ID, password and a link to a website to view the message and video.|`|8EwwSlZ6aa	depending on your cell service i guess...but you should be able to send it as a picture/video message, but instead of putting in her phone number put in her whole email address into the "to" field.    should send right to her. :D|`|KNYF1hnhaa	I have found with experience that sending as a video/picture message does not work.  I get so many people telling me that the login and password does not work on the website.  Your best bet is to send to the email address that the iPhone user has as an attachment so they do not have to deal with a 3rd party website and faulty logins.

ABwnRvfAaa	Dampen a clean cotton rag with a bit of rubbing alcohol and wipe it down.  The rag should not be dripping- wring it out well or just use a little.  The alcohol will clean, disinfect, and dry very quickly.  Good luck.|`|DNEIgO3Aaa	I would use rubbing alcohol because it evaporates very quickly, so if it would get into the microphone as I said it would evaporate with in ten seconds.|`|naJ47XPiaa	Use ur tounge|`|kSyiUxYSaa	I wouldn't use any chemicals as a rule but a very lighty dampened soft cloth with 70% rubbing alcohol on it would work. Why not use a tiny bit of soap and water on a cloth instead?
