I am allergic to all sugars and most sugar substitutes except xylitol and stevia but i don't like  cooking and baking with stevia. Xylitol acts much more like sugar when baking and cooking.   The recipes i found for clementine marmalade don't use pectin. I'm wondering if the peel of the clementine causes the marmalade to thicken. Do I need pectin and how much for an average batch?    Thanks, jane

20090223083303AAdZhSM	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Why are meat eaters so threatened by vegetarianism?	While I understand some might be tired of our moralizing or insinuations that we're ethically superior (I don't believe this), this doesn't seem to be the case here on this site.       Why the animosity?      We all make our stands about values/ethics. The Far Right seems very concerned about fiscal issues- especially when applied to the social sector. I read passionate posts about this from the Right.       Vegetarians feel just as passionately about their ethos. What's the deal?

20090223082620AAEiAqk	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Why is it that the big brewers which are far superior in beer skills make the light beers most people want but?	A fool deleted this question.   Mark had a nice answer.   I don't agree that quality is tied in any way to size of the brewery. Many microbreweries have extremely high quality      Big breweries are trying to make a beer that appeals to as large of an audience as possible. Therefore, they make it safe      Small breweries make beer for a specific targeted audience. As an example, not everybody likes a double hopped India Pale Ale but there is a group (of which I am one) that enjoys this beer. Larger breweries cannot succeed with this business model

I use cake flour, eggs, baking powder, butter, granulated sugar and vanilla in my recipes and the cupcakes are very good, but I would like them to be super-moist. The recipe says to bake them for 20 mins at 350% but after 20 minutes, they seem a little wet on the inside and I thought that the toothpick has to be absolutely clean when I take it out.      Anyone have any ideas? Thank you. I'm careful about sifting and measuring, and although the recipe calls for an electric mixer, I beat the batter by hand til it was the consistency of cookie dough.      I'm grateful. The recipe is the one for Classic Yellow Cupcakes from the book "500 Cupcake Recipes."

20090223095338AA0gLrS	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	What would your name be for your coffee house?	Cafes may have an outdoor section (terrace, pavement or sidewalk cafe) with seats, tables and parasols. This is especially the case with European cafes. Cafes offer a more open public space compared to many of the traditional pubs they have replaced, which were more male dominated with a focus on drinking alcohol.      As the name suggests, coffeehouses focus on providing coffee and tea as well as light snacks. This differs from a café, which is an informal restaurant, offering a range of hot meals, and possibly being licensed to serve alcohol. Many coffee houses in the Muslim world, and in Muslim districts in the West, offer shisha, powdered tobacco smoked through a hookah. In establishments where it is tolerated - which may be found notably in the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam - cannabis may be smoked as well.

20090223104930AAuln86	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What is the "right" temperature, for breads and pretzels?	I asked question about pretzels a couple of weeks ago, because the baking soda and water seemed to penetrate the dough and leave them soggy on me.  The recipes I followed (all 3 of them) called for about 450 to 475 degrees.          An answerer suggested 550, which kept them from being soggy, but made the outside almost crispy, which I don't want for soft pretzels.      I also try to make Italian bread pretty frequently.  The recipe I use calls for 425 for 10 minutes, reduced to 350 for 60 minutes, or until golden-brown.   I've tried this with and without the pan of water and still get a very hard crust, though with water it is more crusty like Artisan bread.  After cooling, the crust seems to soften some, but is overall a pretty tough loaf.  The inside, however, is beautifully chewy and elastic.      I'm wondering what temperature, if any, may be better for a bit softer crust, or for softer-but-not-soggy pretzels.

I enjoy it, and I want to do more, but during cold weather my skin dries out, and my hands crack and split.  I have tried latex gloves and those plastic food-service gloves, to no avail.  The dough sticks to both, and actually pulls the plastic gloves off my hands.      Are there special non-stick gloves out, for kneading dough, or does anyone know a trick to make them non-stick?      * For the record, I live alone and I'm the only one, who eats what I bake.  I wouldn't serve others something kneaded with dry and cracked hands.
