20090223074119AAZV7K1	News & Events;Current Events	What is the saddest term you've heard?	i think its the term "throwaway kids".      WASHINGTON – The FBI has rescued more than 45 suspected teenage prostitutes, some as young as 13, in a nationwide sweep to remove kids from the illegal sex trade and punish their accused pimps.      The teenage prostitutes found in the investigation ranged in age from 13 to 17. "The goal is to recover kids. We consider them the child victims of prostitution," said FBI Deputy Assistant Director Daniel Roberts.      "Unfortunately, the vast majority of these kids are what they term 'throwaway kids,' with no family support, no friends. They're kids that nobody wants, they're loners. Many are runaways," Roberts said.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090223/ap_o...

I mean,,he said no to big bailouts before being elected and he wanted to cut the countries deficeit, but now he passes an almost 800 billion dollar stimulous bailout and the country is even more in debt. He said no to tax increases, but now he is gonna raise taxes. He said no to nationalization, but now he wants to control more than 40% of some banks. Whats next communism. He is gonna want to control what we wear and where we can and cant go! He said no to war, but is sending more troops to afhgany land. Its rediculous how people voted and are still behind him after 2 months in and a handfull of lies ! Americans who voted for him are puppets and believe his every word. Most americans believe what the celebs said also..how great he is..well all those celebs can kiss my ***!

Yeah Kanye Wests ol chipmunk looking *** is what Americans wanted to see on tv that night! You go Obama! You and Oprah are the pride of America!
20090223082350AAKzBJE	News & Events;Current Events	Should parents be held responsible for what their kids do?	I am referring to the now infamous you tube video of Kenny Glenn-cat torturer(i do not know how to post links but google it).This 14 year old idiot beat up his family cats and then with breathe taking stupidly posted the footage on You tube.It did not take long for other internet users to ID him.My point is that after identifying him they then posted his home address,mother and fathers mobile numbers and their places of  work,encouraging people to contact the parents to tell them what they thought.Before anyone gets me wrong-i have watched a little of the footage(couldn't watch much-it made me sick!) and i think that Kenny Glenn is a very disturbed individual who deserves whatever he gets but should his parents details have been posted online as well?.Clearly they are far from great parents(in fact his mother said his punishment was to get his dirt bike taken away)but did they deserve to be lumped in with him and his psychopathic deeds when he was 14 years old and should have known what he was doing was wrong or is this acceptable because you should always know what your kids are up to?

However, i personal believe that this should not be a way to gain forgiveness.   Furthermore, that her new husband was allowed out of jail is a show of failure of the British authorities, I don't believe that allowing a person convicted of assult, or convicted of any crime, should be allowed out. They are in jail as a punishment, and their sentence does not revolve around them.

Why do MI5 use intelligence received by torture? Whatever claims they may make that they will stop using it, can we honestly believe them? How can we stop these covert practices?

Why does no newspaper, no tv channel report about that devestating news to make the public aware of drug abuse??? Yet they are quick to report about staying safe when getting in yoru car at a mall n all this other stuff? dont you think that these overdoses of young ppl should be news, to make parents aware?? yet, there swiped under the carpet like nothing happened?
