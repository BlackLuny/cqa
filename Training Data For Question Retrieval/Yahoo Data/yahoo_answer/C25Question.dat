20090220161346AA6YUFs	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	A Explanation of the Stimulus bill that maybe even Liberals can Understand?	Shortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics professor and says, "I don't understand this new stimulus bill.  Can you explain it to me?"      The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you." The student agreed.      At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house. The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.      They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket.  Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can." The student did as he was instructed.      The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.      The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.      The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?"      The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.      The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.      However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad. The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits.  Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action!"      The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations.  You now understand the new stimulus bill."
20090220160355AAKAvYW	Politics & Government;Politics	Who enabled the banks to make all the bad loans?	Thats right the government!!!      Through the Federal Reserve setting the interest rate at between 1-2% during the early to mid 2000s. Essentially providing the bankers with unlimited amounts of money to loan out.      In a free market interest rates are set by the law of supply and demand, as savings are used up thus sending interest rates higher.  If we had simply let the free market work, instead of price setting, we would not have gotten the huge housing bubble.

20090220162352AAwaIyf	Politics & Government;Politics	Were we mislead?  Was this a propaganda campaign?	From Mien Kampf, by Adolf Hitler.      Volume 1, chapter 6-War Propaganda      “The function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific training of the individual, but in calling the masses' attention to certain facts, processes, necessities, etc., whose significance is thus for the first time placed within their field of vision.”      -How many had heard of Al-Qaeda? There was the 1993 bombing of the WTC, as well as the bombing of the USS Cole. Yet still, after 9/11, how many were scratching their heads saying “Al-who?” A good number were old enough to have remember both of the previous attacks and Al-Qaeda had slipped their minds. Many still are unaware of the fact that we helped these same people against the Soviets in the Afghan War.      “The whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone will be convinced that the fact is real, the process necessary, the necessity correct, etc. But since propaganda is not and cannot be the necessity in itself, since its function, like the poster, consists in attracting the attention of the crowd, and not in educating those who are already educated or who are striving after education and knowledge, its effect for the most part must be aimed at the emotions and only to a very limited degree at the so-called intellect.”      -Hitler had no need for the educated. They were a bane to his plans of a Nationalistic Germany. Socialists and Communists were hunted down in droves. The Jews just happened to make a an easy target for Hitler’s plans.      “All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. But if, as in propaganda for sticking out a war, the aim is to influence a whole people, we must avoid excessive intellectual demands on our public, and too much caution cannot be exerted in this direction. The more modest its intellectual ballast, the more exclusively it takes into consideration the emotions of the masses, the more effective it will be. And this is the best proof of the soundness or unsoundness of a propaganda campaign, and not success in pleasing a few scholars or young aesthetes.”      -The “Elite” in college universities are constantly under attack. As are the young who are accused of falling into the “Liberal” trap of colleges (I have been accused of this as well). The burning of books, the shuttering of universities and the persecution of the professional class is a key occurrence prior to the opening stages of a tyranny. This is because as Hitler said-“All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to.” Propaganda does not work against those who see it as such, so those people are subjugated.      “But the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly and with unflagging attention. It must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the first and most important requirement for success.”      -That one fundamental principle was Freedom-and ours was in “danger”. In American society, freedom is akin to life itself-and no American would ever give any freedom for any safety.      “Give me liberty, or give me death!” -Patrick Henry      “They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” -Benjamin Franklin      An attack on freedom, as I said, is an attack on life to an American. So our freedoms had to be threatened. And threatened they were-so said our leaders.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hQGgwJ5c...       Now, I won’t for a minute deny the savagery of 9/11, nor will I deny the brutality of Saddam Hussein’s reign. My anger is toward those that would use either for political gain and invoke them to invoke a fear.      So, if I’m wrong about all of this, and these are just crazy coincidences, then I am just paranoid-and you can just go on about your lives.      But…what if I’m right?

20090220162059AA4JfQr	Politics & Government;Government	Does everyone understand why Rick Santelli's tirade is wrong?	Steve Liesman is correct but other people (like Santelli, Kudlow, Caruso-Cabrera, etc.) basically have trouble with the ole' "forest for the trees"...  The strange "visceral" reaction people often have to the thought that "someone" (other than themselves of course) "may" get a little help that they "may or may not" deserve is really incredible.  These people don't see the "big picture" irt how the overall economy "including the complainers" will benefit from stabilizing the housing mkt.      In fact, we could have fixed the economy last yr if:      The almost $1T already (in direct recapitalization and guarantees to financial co’s)  had been spent on buying mortgages directly(at avg of .50 on dollar), lowered interest rates to 4%, wrote down mrtgs where necessary, and sat on those loans for the 5-10 yrs it would have taken to clear up the mkts.         The govt could have done this with 10yr bonds at an avg rate of 4% so the interest write down would cost them nothing.         The principal write down would most likely avg out to "a wash" between the mrtgs that turned out to be worth less or more than the .50 they were bought for.        This would have also accomplished the very necessary re-capitalization of the banks because buying the mrtgs from banks would (in and of itself) be recapitalizing them (twice, in fact).  Once with the money used to buy the mrtgs and once by the fact that removing those assets from their books means they don't need as much offsetting capital (re-capitalizing them by default).      Net-Net this would have been MUCH less expensive in the long run IMO but too many people refuse to be willing to do what they see as helping "others" when in fact it "helps them" (and everyone else) as well.  Amazingly, they're ready to cut their nose off to spite their face...      The reason most people are against these measures is that "avg Joe's" have no idea how the economics of the situation plays out and they are simply basing their opinions on visceral responses (emboldened by many in the media) to the thought of someone, other than themselves, getting help they "may" or "may-not" deserve.         To think otherwise about the reasoning of the so called overwhelming majority is to give those "avg Joes" (people who don't follow the markets or economics "at all") far, far too much credit.  For Pete's sake, even some of the "masters of the universe" don't understand the economics of the past or current situation that many of them played a part in causing...       At least some people (like Steve Liesman and the rest of the minority) are able to see the big picture.  It doesn't happen very often but this is definitely one of those times when the minority is absolutely correct.  It usually occurs irt issues like this where, as I said before, the avg Joe just doesn't understand a very complex topic/problem well enough to have an informed opinion.  BTW, getting all your information from the TV doesn't constitute being "informed".

20090220164723AANbFe6	Politics & Government;Politics	Where exactly is this change?	Obama's policies are so far:      1. More war without a timeline (i.e. Afghanistan)   2. More spending   3. More borrowing and printing   4. More government waste and opaqueness (steamrolling the largest spending through Congress)   5. More devaluing of the dollar      The Dem's steamrolled the "stimulus bill" through Congress under the guise of "transparency". Only 10 hard copies were available and not even our Congressman had time to review the bill.      By escalating the war in Afghanistan, The Obama administration is practicing a "guns and butter" strategy combined with voodoo supply-side economics. The "guns and butter" policies failed under Johnson and he had a working economy and didn't cut taxes.  We need a strong leader who can make tough and critical decisions, not a leader who will overextend himself and our nation's resources.      We are going to continue to spend a trillion dollars a year on maintaining our empire while implementing a New, New Deal, all while cutting taxes and we are both militarily and economically strained.  This is a recipe for failure, not success.      There is no new change. It is the same strategy, but different tactics.

During the last 8 years, I've heard a lot of republican politicians and pundits claim that publicly speaking out against the government/president was "unpatriotic". Now that Obama is president, a lot of those same people are Obama-bashing. Especially with republicans refusing to help in the political process to fix our country, can they be considered unpatriotic by their own standards? Or were they never patriotic to the nation, but rather only patriotic to their own party?
20090220162216AAAopCi	Politics & Government;Politics	What woWhy don't they write in anti-bonus provisions into the bailouts?uld you like to ask?	First, let me say, that I lean more to the left side of the political spectrum and this isn't a shot at the bailouts. However, after hearing--again--about ceo giving themselves bonuses with the bailout money, I was wondering why Congress hasn't learned to start writing in provisions to stop this frivolous abuse of our money?      I really hope that in the future they would take this into consideration if they decide to give more money, but it just really aggravates me that these companies aren't suffering any repercussions when they abuse the help we give them.         Why do you think they keep getting away with this? Why do you think Congress is still allowing them to do this?

Introduction       In the matter of ______ 's Estate, his will has been probated. On Sept 1st 2008, a court order was issued. All filed debts have been met. The estate was left open over a period of six months. On February 1st 2009, a final approved settlement was entered; only after all filed debts were paid. The final settlement was approved.      II.                 Facts               On Sept 1st 2008, Mr X’s Estate is probated    On Sept 1st 2008, a court order is issued    On Oct 1st 2008, MR. X is arrested; for holdng the estate.    On Feb 1st 2009, an approved final settlement is entered.    On Sept 1st 2008, the Estate is probated    Throughout the year of 2008-2009, Mr.X is served numerous copies of the court order.    Mr. X is served copies of the final approved settlement    Yet, Mr. X continues to hold half of the estate; the second vehicle.    Mr. X was arrested on charges of failure to make a required disposition.    Mr. X is well aware of the existing court order    Both vehicles belonged to the estate; at the time of the deceaced's death.    According to (this is where i quote a law TRS 101), neither vehicle was ever repossessed.    Both vehicles belong to the estate.    I am the sole executor of the deceased''s estate.   III.               Argument       IV.                I am entitled to possess the car. I am entitled to have both vehicles entered into my name. I am entitled to these requests for three reasons. First, on Feb 1st 2008, the Estate was probated. Second, on Feb 1st 2008, a court order is issued. Third, on Feb 1st 2009, an approved final settlement is entered.       V.                  Conclusion       For these reasons, this court should grant my motion claim of property and title both vehicles in my name.   FEB-          -2009               Respectfully submitted,   By:_______________________________   Address                   Legal Memorandum       In  Estate vs. Mr. X      On Sep 1st 2008, the Estate is probated    On Sep 1st 2008, a court order is issued    On Oct 1st 2008, Mr.X was arrested.    On Feb 1st 2009, an approved final settlement is entered.    On Sep 1st 2008, the Estate is probated         From Sept 2008 – Feb 2009, Mr. X has been served the court order. On Oct 1st 2008, Mr. X is arrested. Mr. X’s charges stem from failure to make a required disposition.       Before Mr.X's arrest, he submitted a letter; to the district court. The letter stated that both vehicles had been repossessed. This false statement was considered and then measured against KRS.186.190.       According to KRS.186.190, this statement is absolutely false. Furthermore repossession did not occur; according to KRS.186.190.                  Upon Mr. X’s arrest, only one vehicle was confiscated. Today Mr. X continues to hold the estate’s 2nd vehicle. Throughoutthe year, Mr. X has absolutely no regard; for the existing court order.

I'm looking to move into an apartment in Memphis soon, and being a young single woman living alone, I' a bit concerned about my safety. My boyfriend has recommended a few different weapons for home defense, but I have no clue what to choose.      -Heckler & Koch USP45   -Glock 17 9mm   -Sig Sauer P226 40SW   -Mossberg 500 Cruiser   -Remington 870   -Springfield Armory XD45   -Mossberg 500 Tactical Persuader    I'm open to other suggestions, but I do have a few concerns to voice. Since I'll be living in an apartment complex, I'd prefer to stay away from supersonic rounds. Rifles are completely out of the question. Now, I have experience with hunting, so recoil is not an issue. Please give me your opinions on the weapons listed, and any other guns you would suggest.      One last thing- I'm looking for a burglar gun, not a concealed carry weapon. I'd prefer not to shoot, so if it looks scary, it'll do.

20090220164605AABtLTC	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the Stimulus Package unfair to people who were fiscally responsible prior to the economic crisis?	I currently own a house that I bought four years ago. I worked very hard to secure a down payment after years of saving every nickle and dime. I have been fiscally responsible and have never been late on my mortgage. I am currently in the process of selling and purchasing a new home closer to work. What pisses me off is I will not get any help from the stimulus package; yet those who were irresponsible (home owners as well as banks) have everything to gain from this package. Though I have a steady job, that took a lot of hard-work to get, others who are not as responsible in the decisions they have made in their lives (past and present) seem to be rewarded.      Why doesn't the package help me?

Ce qui m'agace c'est que leur entourage respectif sont harcelés par certains groupes de pression et peüt-être même sont-ils sujets à certains cadeaux (corruption...,qui sait ?...)...   La France est multiculturelle, et moi aussi j'en suis un de ses facettes( étant fils d'immigrés turcs arrivant dans les années 70), mais je constate que la république a des failles démocratiques qui sont liées au communautarisme, voire à l'ultracommunautarisme...   La communauté arménienne est implantée depuis très longtemps, et par conséquent ils sont tous citoyens fran?ais et élécteurs...   La communauté turque est aussi importante, démographiquement parlant, sauf que seulement 20% de ses membres ont opté pour la nationalité fran?aise...   Par conséquent le rapport est très déséquilibré, ce qui explique peüt-?tre l'attitude de toutou qu'ont certains élus ( le maire de Marseille en est l'exemple typique)...

At least when your education is completed you will have that education to get a better job. You can take many courses on line. You would qualify for food stamps, child care assistance, fuel assistance, rent assistance, WIC. Many organizations provide other forms of monetary assistance for those who want a better life. Why do so many not take advantage of these programs? Why do they get complacent? Why do they not try? I do not get it!       In my mind, if you are poor, you choose to be poor. A few years of hard work to better yourself is worth a lifetime of not having to struggle.

Voici ce poème :      "Parmi ceux qui sont en prison   Se trouvent nos 3 camarades   Berselli, Planquette et Simon   Qui vont passer des jours maussades    Vous êtes tous trois enfermés   Mais Patience, prenez courage   Vous serez bient?t libérés   Par tous vos frères d’esclavage      Les tra?tres de notre pays   Ces agents du capitalisme   Nous les chasserons hors d’ici   Pour instaurer le socialisme      Main dans la main Révolution   Pour que vainque le communisme   Pour vous sortitr de la prison   Pour tuer le capitalisme      Ils se sont sacrifiés pour nous   Par leur action libératrice        Guy M?quet"      Puisqu'il faut citer des paroles de jeunes résistants, pourquoi pas celles là ?

Il y a une DIFFERENCE énorme entre la population noire américaine et la population noire fran?aise, les afro américains sont arrivés en même temps que les blancs aux états unis, (esclaves et esclavagistes vous vous souvenez ?) Ils ont donc autant de droit que les blancs américains de vouloir présider ce pays, ils l'ont construit tout autant qu'eux...      En France, c'est différent, les africains sont là depuis une cinquaintaine d'année a tout casser, soit a peine deux générations, la troisiéme étant en route...Faut arrêter de rêver, POUR LE MOMENT, un africain même né en France n'a pas vraiment sa place en tant que président de la France, peut être dans un futur lointain...      Et ce n'est en aucun cas raciste, juste réaliste... Si un blanc essaye de devenir président en Afrique on risque d'entendre crier au pouvoir Colonnial...pourtant les blancs sont depuis plus longtemps en Afrique, que l'inverse...

20070916131412AA08y64	Politics & Government;Government	Que opinan de este descaro, que quiere el gobierno chileno?	Publicado: Tue Aug 21, 2007 6:43 am    Título del mensaje: CHILE APROVECHA DESGRACIA TERREMOTO Y NOS QUITA EL MAR PERU         --------------------------------------...       Ingredientes de una maliciosa estrategia en marcha       Gráfico que resume el Mapa de Dominio Marítimo Fronterizo Sur del Perú, que ha sido presentado a las Naciones Unidas, con la finalidad de asegurar nuestra soberanía y defensa de las 200 millas marinas y un reparto proporcional de aguas entre los dos países.    Félix C. Calderón*       Con motivo de la publicación, por parte del Gobierno peruano, el pasado domingo 12 de agosto, de la carta que grafica el límite exterior –sector sur– del dominio marítimo del Perú, se ha desencadenado en Chile una inusitada ofensiva mediática que corresponde analizarla con cierto detenimiento con el objeto de determinar el fin que persigue. Dicho de otra manera, esta reacción aparentemente airada de los chilenos no es un hecho casual ni guarda relación directa con el acto soberano del Perú, sino que respondería a una finalidad distinta. Veamos los hechos.    Por un lado, voceros autorizados de La Moneda se han puesto en la condición de ofendidos, se?alando a grosso modo que lo dispuesto soberanamente por el Gobierno del Perú no es aceptable para su país, negándole "efecto jurídico internacional." Con mucho de teatro y una apariencia de firmeza, un desencajado canciller chileno declaró ese mismo domingo 12: "quiero decirlo muy claramente (sic), desconoce los tratados vigentes sobre la delimitación fronteriza (sic) con Chile", agregando que su país continuará ejerciendo "plenamente" todos los derechos que le corresponden "en los espacios bajo su soberanía y jurisdicción." Finalmente, se?aló que con la publicación del mapa se contradecía "todos los esfuerzos para avanzar en todos (sic) los ámbitos de la relación bilateral" durante los últimos a?os. A esto sumó el redactor, como un trascendido, que "se habría reafirmado las instrucciones vigentes en tal sentido a la Armada de Chile. (El Mercurio, edición de 13 de agosto de 2007).       Por otro lado, en un tono más o menos belicoso, algunos congresistas chilenos han dado a conocer su opinión, sin faltar el gesto destemplado del presidente de la Cámara de Diputados Patricio Walker que, al parecer, habría cancelado su visita al Perú por considerar el hecho como "una provocación mayor", u otros más rocambolescos que aventuran que se ha puesto en peligro la paz bilateral o que se trata de una actitud hostil. En suma, la reacción oficial y oficiosa en Chile busca trasmitir al mundo la sensación de sorpresa, indignación y firmeza contra lo que es presentado como una acto inamistoso y violatorio del Derecho Internacional.       Surgen, por tanto, algunas preguntas: ?Desconocía Chile los actos preparatorios del Perú que culminaron el 12 de agosto con la publicación del mencionado mapa? ?Es procedente considerar ese acto del Gobierno del Perú como violatorio del Derecho Internacional? ?Puede hablarse de "todos los ámbitos de la relación bilateral" sin tener para nada en cuenta el problema bilateral con el Perú en materia de delimitación marítima? En fin, ?qué se pretende decir con ese trascendido acerca de haber reafirmado las instrucciones vigentes a la Armada de Chile?       Con relación a la primera pregunta, la respuesta es clara y terminante: Chile estuvo al tanto, día a día, de lo que con todo derecho venían trabajando rigurosamente los especialistas peruanos, para contar con las mediciones más precisas posibles, en estricto cumplimiento de lo dispuesto en los artículos 4o y 5o de la Ley de Líneas de Base del Dominio Marítimo del Perú, Ley No 28621, que a su vez encuentra su basamento constitucional en lo dispuesto en el artículo 54o de la Constitución vigente. Es decir, lo que ha venido haciendo el Perú en legítima defensa de sus derechos en el sector sur de su dominio marítimo no era, en absoluto, nuevo en Chile, aparte que suponemos que su Embajada en Lima fue meticulosa en sus regulares informes al respecto. Sin ir muy lejos, en la reciente cumbre de Tarija, el Presidente del Perú tuvo el gesto amical de informar a la Presidenta de Chile acerca de la decisión del Perú de llevar el litigio de marras a la Corte Internacional de Justicia de La Haya. No era necesario, pero lo hizo en gesto de buena voluntad, porque estamos hablando de una solución pacífica de la controversia. Y con motivo del tradicional discurso a la Nación, el pasado 28 de julio, volvió a reiterar esa decisión, sin doblez ni segunda intención de ninguna clase.       Más aún, esta posición del Perú no es nueva. Ya en 1979, el artículo 98o de la Constitución aprobada por la Asamblea Constituyente consagró de manera indubitable que "el dominio marítimo del Estado comprende el mar adyacente a sus costas, así como su lecho y subsuelo, hasta la distancia de doscientas millas marinas medidas desde las líneas de base que establece la ley." Por ningún lado se hizo mención a los paralelos geográficos, solamente a las líneas de base establecidas por ley. Por eso, consistente con lo anterior, el 27 de agosto de 1980, dentro del marco de la Tercera Conferencia de las Naciones sobre el Derecho del Mar, el Perú dejó constancia en actas que con respecto a los criterios de delimitación, a falta de convenio específico de delimitación concertado de manera expresa para fijar definitivamente los límites de tales zonas, debía aplicarse como regla general la línea media o la equidistancia, por tratarse del método más idóneo para llegar a una solución equitativa. Como lógica consecuencia y dentro del espíritu de encontrar una solución dialogada al problema bilateral, en mayo de 1986 el Gobierno peruano tomó la iniciativa, a través de un enviado especial, de plantear a su contraparte chilena el inicio "en el futuro de conversaciones acerca de sus puntos de vista referentes a la delimitación marítima." Propuesta que fue prudentemente respondida por el entonces canciller Jaime del Valle "manifestando (luego de tomar nota) que oportunamente se harán estudios sobre el particular." Vale decir, no se respondió con ninguna bravata ni hubo tampoco un rechazo formal de Chile, como corresponde a un entredicho entre países civilizados.       La Constitución de 1993 se limitó, como es obvio, en su artículo 54o a transcribir ad litteram ese derecho previamente consagrado en la Constitución de 1979. Y cuando el Gobierno chileno, con fecha 21 de setiembre de 2000, depositó en la Secretaría General de Naciones Unidas de conformidad con lo dispuesto en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derecho del Mar (Convemar) de 1982, las cartas en las que incluía su pretensión sobre la línea del paralelo como límite marítimo con el Perú, la Representación Permanente del Perú respondió mediante nota de fecha 21 de enero de 2001, para dejar expresa constancia de que el Perú no reconocía esa línea imaginaria como límite marítimo entre ambos países. Es más, como una manera de cortar por lo sano lo que podía convertirse en un diálogo de sordos, el 19 de julio de 2004, el Gobierno del Perú propuso formalmente a su par chileno el inicio de negociaciones bilaterales para resolver la controversia, avanzando un plazo como una forma de evitar que el asunto se remitiera en Chile a las calendas griegas. Por último, en apretada síntesis, no obstante la negativa chilena de 10 de setiembre a la propuesta peruana, ese mismo a?o, 2004, concretamente el 4 de noviembre, los cancilleres del Perú y Chile suscribieron un Comunicado Conjunto, en el marco de la XVIII Cumbre de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno del Grupo de Río, en el que, al margen de se?alar que se tienen posiciones distintas, dejaron expresa constancia del carácter jurídico de la cuestión (la delimitación marítima), además de constituir "estrictamente un asunto bilateral (sic)."       Entonces, si por cerca de 30 a?os y a medida que se verificaba un vuelco fundamental en la doctrina y la normativa del Derecho del Mar, el Perú se cuidó de dejar sentado su derecho en cuanto al límite exterior –sector sur- de su dominio marítimo, ?cómo explicar, ahora, tanto aspaviento o la aparente sorpresa de los chilenos? ?No resulta desproporcionada esa reacción oficial a la luz de lo antedicho? ?O es, más bien, uno de los ingredientes de una maliciosa estrategia en marcha? La respuesta es una y la encontraremos más adelante.       En cuanto a la siguiente pregunta si ha incurrido el Perú en violación del Derecho Internacional, la respuesta es concluyente: no. Todo lo contrario, ha puesto en evidencia que el Derecho Internacional ha sido hecho para ser respetado. En efecto, si el 4 de noviembre de 2004 el canciller de Chile, Ignacio Walker, suscribió un Comunicado Conjunto con su homólogo peruano en el que se precisaba de manera meridiana que el "tema de la delimitación marítima entre ambos países (...) constituye estrictamente (sic) un asunto bilateral", ?por obra de qué conjuro, entonces, pretende Chile fundar arbitraria y unilateralmente una supuesta delimitación marítima con el Perú al amparo de un convenio de naturaleza multilateral? Si es "estrictamente un asunto bilateral" como ha reconocido formalmente por escrito Chile, ?dónde está el tratado bilateral sobre delimitación marítima concluido con el Perú? A fortiori, también se reconoció en esa oportunidad que la cuestión de la delimitación marítima es de naturaleza jurídica, de donde se desprende sin mayor esfuerzo que es imposible concretarla fuera del marco de un tratado o acuerdo ad hoc, concluido con esa finalidad expresa y determinada, de carácter bilateral y respetando estrictamente las formalidades que secularmente le reconoce el ius cogens a los tratados o convenios de delimitación fronteriza entre dos Estados en lo que ata?e a su celebración y entrada en vigor (plenos poderes, forma de manifestación del consentimiento en obligarse por el tratado, canje o depósito de los instrumentos de ratificación, y manera y fecha de la entrada en vigor propiamente dicha). La doctrina y la jurisprudencia internacional sobre el particular van en abono de este aserto. Por tanto, no es el Perú quien pone en aprietos al Derecho Internacional, sino Chile, si se tiene en cuenta que la posición peruana, repetida una y mil veces, es que no existe un tratado bilateral con Chile sobre delimitación marítima.       Es verdad que Chile esgrime como tal la Declaración de Santiago o "Declaración sobre Zona Marítima" de 18 de agosto de 1952, combinada curiosamente con el "Convenio sobre Zona Especial Fronteriza Marítima" de 4 de diciembre de 1954. Sin embargo, aparte que la propia naturaleza MULTILATERAL de la "declaración" y del acuerdo complementario los hace impropios, inválidos, desde el punto de vista del ius cogens, como para zanjar la delimitación marítima entre dos Estados (porque ésta, repetimos, es un problema forzosamente bilateral); existen, adicionalmente, los problemas de la finalidad expresa de ambos (proteger y aprovechar los recursos marinos) y las formalidades simplistas que se siguieron para su entrada en vigor, que los convierten más en resoluciones que en tratados o convenios, por más que nuestros vecinos se esmeren en soterrar o soslayar esa condición sui géneris.       En el acuerdo de 1952, la finalidad expresa fue "conservar y asegurar para sus pueblos respectivos las riquezas naturales en las zonas del mar que ba?a sus costas (sic)." Por eso, se "declaró" la voluntad multilateral (tres países) de "proclamar" una zona de soberanía y jurisdicción exclusivas "hasta (sic) una distancia de 200 millas marinas desde las referidas costas." Dicho de otra manera, en esa declaración multilateral, de un espíritu netamente resolutivo (no contractual), los Estados signatarios se comprometieron a proteger a través de un acto unilateral una indeterminada ("hasta") zona de mar que ba?a sus costas en función de la finalidad expresa. Tan genérica y referencial fue esa "declaración", lo cual no podía ser de otra manera porque la comunidad internacional se encontraba en el período neolítico del Derecho del Mar, que no constituyó un requisito indispensable su aprobación por los respectivos Congresos de los Estados involucrados ni se estipuló la modalidad de su entrada en vigor. Aspectos éstos de suma importancia, porque la delimitación marítima entre dos Estados si se quiere que sea "eterna" debe ser producto de un tratado o convenio bilateral, concluido formalmente y aprobado por el Poder Legislativo de ambos países, para después proceder a su ratificación en buena y debida forma.       Por otra parte, dentro del marco de esa misma finalidad de "explotación y conservación de las riquezas marítimas del Pacífico Sur", declarada en 1952, se adoptó dos a?os más tarde, siempre en el plano multilateral, el "Convenio sobre Zona Especial Fronteriza Marítima", que tampoco exigió como condición sine qua nom a los Estados firmantes el requisito de la aprobación de los respectivos Congresos ni especificó la fecha de entrada en vigor. Si se revisa su texto, no son "los Estados Partes" los que se comprometen ni mucho menos se exige la ratificación como expresión del consentimiento de los Estados en obligarse por dicho convenio. Y en cuanto a su contenido, si bien se habla de "límite marítimo" éste solo tiene un carácter meramente referencial de la columna de agua suprayacente para establecer esa "zona especial" de diez millas marinas de ancho a cada lado a partir de las 12 millas marítimas de la costa. Nada se dice del zócalo continental ni del status jurídico del espacio dentro de esas 12 millas; por cuanto, su objeto, como ha quedado dicho, era "evitar la posibilidad de involuntarias infracciones" entre "los pescadores" que pudieran traducirse en fricciones entre los países vecinos. Es decir, el "objeto y fin" del convenio no era la delimitación marítima, y no podía serlo porque se trataba de un convenio de menor cuantía de naturaleza multilateral vinculado a la "declaración" de 1952.       Su razón de ser fue coadyuvar a determinar la posición en alta mar de las embarcaciones. De allí su carácter reglamentario relativo a la "pesca o caza", lo que explica que en el párrafo segundo no se considere la presencia accidental en la "zona especial fronteriza marítima" como "violación de las aguas en la zona marítima", pues más que acuerdo de delimitación marítima era un simple y expeditivo procedimiento de fortalecimiento de la confianza entre los Estados vecinos. Por eso, la simplificación extrema de formalidades en términos contractuales y su subordinación a los eventuales incidentes entre los pescadores lo ha hecho con el paso de los a?os un documento inútil, anacrónico, totalmente superado por el progreso de las tecnologías.       Hito revolucionario    Así las cosas, en 1958 tuvo lugar, en Ginebra, la Primera Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho del Mar. Un hito revolucionario en la historia de este novísimo derecho en tanto en cuanto fue allí cuando se adoptaron, por vez primera, cuatro convenciones sobre la materia, aunque sin llegar necesariamente a ponerse de acuerdo sobre algunos puntos capitales, como la anchura del "mar territorial." Es decir, la "declaración" con las proclamaciones unilaterales y el convenio de menor cuantía de 1954, ambos de carácter multilateral, aplicables a tres Estados del Pacífico Sur, fueron apenas bosquejos o wishful thinking, con un fin explícito distinto al de la delimitación marítima. El hecho mismo que en Ginebra, en 1958, se hayan adoptado cuatro convenciones relativas al derecho del mar, da una idea de la visión de compartimentos estanco que todavía se tenía de los diferentes espacios involucrados en el Derecho del Mar. Por consiguiente, no es de extra?ar que no existiera aún una relación directa entre los derechos de soberanía del Estado costero sobre la plataforma continental y el estatus legal de las aguas suprayacentes. Asimismo, la Convención sobre Mar Territorial incluía el concepto gaseoso de "zona contigua", y decimos así porque no precisaba su punto de inicio al no existir acuerdo sobre la anchura del mar territorial. En pocas palabras, los cincuentas y sesentas fueron a?os de fragua del Derecho del Mar, la preocupación de los Estados se centraba primordialmente en definir los límites exteriores de su soberanía y jurisdicción sobre el mar adyacente a sus costas con el propósito de proteger y aprovechar los recursos existentes en esa zona.       Solo para tener una idea del salto doctrinal y normativo que se produjo en la década de los setentas, el concepto de "zona económica exclusiva" apareció recién en la reunión que tuvo lugar en Lagos en 1972, de suerte tal que cuando se inició la Tercera Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho del Mar en 1973, tanto este concepto como el correlativo de las 200 millas adquirieron sentido. La misma suerte no tuvo, sin embargo, el concepto de "mar territorial" sujeto en los siglos XVII y XVIII al límite de las tres millas náuticas, equivalente al alcance del tiro de ca?ón, y que desde la Liga de las Naciones, en 1930, osciló en el plano multilateral entre las tres y doce millas, para terminar en doce millas con la Convemar de 1982.       Por eso, cuando en 1968 y 1969 el Perú y Chile suscribieron notas referidas a la instalación de faros de enfilamiento, ninguna de las partes podía estar pensando en zanjar el problema de la delimitación marítima, debido a la pobreza que todavía exhibía el Derecho Internacional consuetudinario en ese ámbito, no existiendo acuerdo firme, convencional y universalmente definido en cuanto a la anchura del mar territorial. Ergo, el objeto de esos documentos suscritos en 1968 y 1969 no pudo ser otro que el se?alar una línea de referencia para un fin menor, cual es de tener una zona de tolerancia pesquera, de allí que le sirvan de sustento precario los documentos cuasi resolutivos multilaterales de 1952 y 1954. Mal podían dos Estados costeros disponer de un espacio marítimo que no era visto todavía desde la perspectiva tridimensional por todos los Estados. A decir verdad, el Derecho del Mar atravesaba por su período medieval en lo atinente a soberanía y jurisdicción del Estado costero sobre su mar adyacente.       Si bien es verdad que en ambos documentos de 1968 y 1969 se hace mención a la expresión "límite marítimo"; es igualmente cierto que tampoco aparece por ningún lado una referencia explícita al tratado bilateral que debió previamente definir el espacio marítimo del que se está hablando, porque esa pretensión insólita de identificar el punto de inicio del supuesto paralelo de la línea marítima con el "Hito número uno (No 1)" solo tendría asidero si previa y formalmente así hubiere sido convenido por el Perú y Chile en un tratado válido. Condición ésta indispensable, pues en ese preciso momento ya era parte del ius cogens la necesidad de un acuerdo bilateral entre dos Estados con costas adyacentes o, por defecto, la línea media o de equidistancia. Peor aún, el ius cogens prohibía ir más allá de esa línea media o de equidistancia a falta de acuerdo bilateral expreso. De donde se sigue que el fraseo que aparece en la introducción del documento de 22 de agosto de 1969, por el cual los representantes del Perú y Chile, luego "de verificar la posición geográfica primigenia del Hito de concreto número uno (No 1) de la frontera común (sic)", se refieren a "fijar los puntos de ubicación de las Marcas de Enfilación que han acordado (sic) instalar ambos países para se?alar el límite marítimo", carece de validez jurídica por no estar basado en un tratado bilateral que consagre ese acuerdo. La frase "que han acordado instalar ambos países", impone la siguiente pregunta a cualquier lego en la materia: ?En qué momento el Perú y Chile acordaron que la ubicación de la "Marcas de Enfilación" implicaba se?alar el límite marítimo entre ambos países? Como es sabido, el punto inicial o final (como mejor parezca) de la demarcación de la frontera entre Perú y Chile con arreglo al Tratado de 1929, resulta ser, stricto sensu, la intersección del arco de diez kilómetros de radio con el Océano Pacífico, de conformidad con lo estipulado en el artículo 2o del Tratado de 1929 y el "Acta Final de la Comisión de Límites con la descripción de los hitos colocados", de 21 de julio de 1930. Y para infortunio de los chilenos, el documento de abril de 1968 tampoco brinda el sustento jurídico necesario, pues allí se dice algo peor: "estudiar en el terreno mismo la instalación de marcas de enfilación visibles desde el mar, que materialicen el paralelo de la frontera marítima que se origina en el Hito número uno (No 1)." Para que estos documentos supuestamente de demarcación tengan algún valor en cualquier órgano jurisdiccional internacional, es menester exhibir al mismo tiempo el tratado bilateral que establece la delimitación propiamente dicha con arreglo al derecho internacional. Todo lo demás, es precario jurídicamente y hasta pueril.       Tan deleznable es la posición oficial de Chile sobre el particular, que conviene saber si ha guardado coherencia en esos casi 30 a?os en que el Perú viene reclamándole concluir un tratado de delimitación marítima. Por definición, la buena fe preside el inconmovible principio del pacta sunt servanda en el cual se funda todo el Derecho Internacional. Y la coherencia a través del tiempo es uno de los criterios para medir la buena fe.       Para referirnos tan solo a los últimos siete a?os, aun cuando esos documentos de 1968 y 1969 no podían modificar en un ápice el sacrosanto Tratado de 1929, es pertinente preguntarse ?fue coherente Chile en cuanto al supuesto inicio en la costa de su pretenso límite marítimo? En la nota de 10 de setiembre de 2004, la entonces ministra de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile, Soledad Alvear, después de se?alar que no era procedente "referirse a negociaciones sobre convenios vigentes (sic)", agregó: "que han establecido el límite marítimo entre Chile y Perú en el paralelo 18o 21’ 03’’ (sic)." En un sentido más tajante se pronunció el canciller Ignacio Walker en nota de 3 de noviembre de 2005: "que establecen inequívocamente (sic) la existencia del paralelo que fija el límite marítimo entre Chile y Perú ubicado en 18o 21’ 03’’ (sic) de latitud Sur." Sin embargo, cuando Chile presentó a la Secretaría de Naciones Unidas, el 21 de setiembre de 2000, las cartas elaboradas de conformidad con lo dispuesto en el artículo 16o, párrafo 2, artículo 75o, párrafo 2, y artículo 84o, párrafo 2, de la Convemar, acreditó el paralelo 18o 21’ 00’’ como límite de su supuesta frontera marítima con el Perú.       En la hipótesis negada de que la frontera marítima peruano-chilena hubiera sido establecida conforme al Derecho Internacional, ?es posible que el mismo Estado que sostiene esa tesis ofrezca oficialmente como punto de inicio paralelos diferentes? Pese a que el origen de esa distinción no la explican los documentos antes mencionados, los chilenos pueden argüir que se trata, en puridad, del mismo paralelo si se emplean las coordenadas astronómicas. Pero, ?no es ésa otra forma de demostrar la inexistencia de un tratado bilateral de delimitación marítima? Por eso, resulta peregrina la tesis que sostiene que los documentos de 1968 y 1969 (escondidos bajo la denominación "otros acuerdos vinculantes") establecieron "inequívocamente" una supuesta frontera. ?Qué cosa significa "inequívocamente"? Solo un tratado bilateral fija los parámetros de manera inequívoca. De lo contrario lo único inequívoco sería la incoherencia.       ?Qué dicen algunos especialistas chilenos cuando tienen que abordar, desde el punto de vista académico, esta incoherencia que presenta la posición chilena? Si los documentos de 1968 y 1969 no se fundan en un tratado ad hoc que contenga la aceptación explícita de los dos Estados en cuanto a la delimitación marítima y, por ende, defina el punto de inicio, imaginario o no, ?es posible inventar un punto de inicio dentro del marco de un procedimiento administrativo que respondía a otra finalidad y completamente ajeno al procedimiento taxativo estipulado en el artículo 3 del Tratado de 1929, relativo a la demarcación de la línea fronteriza allí consagrada? Estamos seguros que a estas alturas del raciocinio el lector ya tiene parte de la respuesta a la última pregunta planteada al inicio; por cuanto, las bravatas, la dosis volitiva de prepotencia y el minué de la Marina de Guerra chilena, no serían más que reflejo de esa debilidad argumental, que en La Haya puede muy bien hacer que su posición se desmorone como un castillo de arena. Pues, si tuviera Chile la certeza de tener el derecho de su lado, en vez de adelantar la incompetencia de la Corte Internacional de Justicia de la Haya, debería, por el contrario, manifestar su disposición a concurrir con amplitud de miras para zanjar su diferendo limítrofe con el Perú. Pero, ?es el comportamiento tradicional de Chile respetuoso del Derecho Internacional? ?Qué dice la historia?       En 1879, el Perú se vio envuelto en una guerra de agresión emprendida por Chile, a causa de su "cándido heroicismo" de querer seguir dando crédito a un tratado defensivo que había perdido su sentido por el rechazo de Argentina. La guerra se concluyó luego de imponer el invasor a Miguel Iglesias como presidente y, previamente, obligarlo a aceptar las condiciones de paz. Y puesto que se trataba de hacer capitular al vencido, la aprobación del Tratado de Ancón por el Congreso Constituyente peruano, en marzo de 1884, se hizo bajo la coerción de las bayonetas del ejército de ocupación chileno. El plebiscito que debía organizarse en diez a?os para decidir la suerte de las provincias cautivas de Arica y Tacna, fue incumplido por Chile, procediendo más bien desde 1900 al primer national cleansing de la historia en el mundo a fin de ganar dicho plebiscito. Pero, como los peruanos en las provincias cautivas no se dejaron arredrar por la bota, tuvo Chile que aceptar, por fin, en julio de 1922 la participación arbitral de Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, desde fines del siglo XIX volvió a desconocer el Tratado de Ancón, usurpando también una parte importante de la provincia de Tarata. Enseguida, unilateralmente, dispuso en 1902 el trazo del ferrocarril Arica-La Paz, mordiendo, precisamente, una esquina de la provincia de Tarata que, como se sabe, no era objeto del Tratado de Ancón. Además, en el tratado de paz y límites con Bolivia, de 1904, cedió a este país porciones de la provincia de Arica cuya suerte estaba todavía por decidirse en el plebiscito. Es decir, los hechos consumados, nótese bien, habían pasado a ser parte de su arrolladora conducta, con total prescindencia del Derecho Internacional de la época. Cuando vio en 1926 que podía perder el plebiscito y era inminente que devuelva la totalidad de la porción de la provincia de Tarata indebidamente ocupada, puso obstáculos a la mediación estadounidense a cambio de solicitar el arreglo bilateral con el Perú. Concluido el Tratado de 1929, Chile no devolvió la totalidad de Tacna ni el pedazo usurpado de Tarata y, encima, privó de puerto a Tacna, aunque comprometiéndose a construir un muelle para el Perú con base en un plano de desarrollo portuario que tampoco respetó. Y en noviembre de 1999, cuando se concluyó el Acta de Ejecución volvió a infringir el Derecho Internacional en la medida que en el artículo 1. declaró haber construido el muelle "para el servicio del Perú dentro de los mil quinientos setenta y cinco metros de la bahía de Arica." Mas, las dudas campean. ?Se encuentra realmente ese costado de muelle, inútil y ridículo, dentro de los mil quinientos setenta y cinco metros de la bahía de Arica, tal como lo prevé el artículo 5 del Tratado de 1929? ?Qué pasaría si se comprueba meridianamente que ése no es el caso? En una palabra, ?quién se ha caracterizado históricamente por hacer escarnio del Derecho Internacional?       Con relación a la tercera pregunta formulada, al inicio ?se puede avanzar en "todos los ámbitos de la relación bilateral" con prescindencia del serio y urticante problema de la delimitación marítima peruano-chilena? Hasta donde se sabe, los Presidentes del Perú y Chile, el 20 de setiembre de 2004, con ocasión de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas coincidieron en que la controversia bilateral sobre delimitación marítima debía tratarse "por cuerda separada", dentro de un marco estrictamente jurídico. Por otro lado, ?en qué queda la declaración del canciller chileno de entonces Ignacio Walker de que ese litigio constituía "estrictamente un asunto bilateral"? Evidentemente, resulta un contrasentido referirse a "todos los ámbitos de la relación bilateral" con un enfoque unilateral à la carte. Existe una controversia entre el Perú y Chile, de carácter jurídico, en materia de delimitación marítima y pretender negarlo es querer tapar el sol con un dedo.       Llegamos, así, a la última pregunta, ?qué se pretende crispando la atmósfera bilateral y dramatizando el estado de ánimo con paseíllos de un par de patrulleras? Somos de los que creen que en este siglo XXI han perdido sustento las guerras de agresión. Por tanto, no parece que los tambores de guerra suenen en esa dirección. No. Sin embargo, consciente como es Chile de que la posición jurídica que sustenta su pretensión es inconsistente, no tiene, al parecer, mejor expediente a la luz de su comportamiento histórico, que recurrir a las bravatas y gestos destemplados para evitar de esta manera que sea puesta otra vez en evidencia su conducta usurpadora. No es que tenga derecho, lo que ocurre es que teme al derecho.       Antes de concluir, es deseable que en el Perú todos, sin excepción, cierren filas por una causa de indiscutible alcance nacional. Y aquellos que creen que pueden marchar a contracorriente para que otros sepan que existen, deberían pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar para subrayar lo que no es sustancial en el reforzamiento de la posición peruana. La patria requiere en esta hora de la unión y la prudencia, no de la discrepancia sobre lo contingente ni la apostilla enfermiza que en nada abona a la defensa del interés nacional. Por eso, aquellos que improvisan con la máscara de "internacionalistas" sería preferible que piensen primero si sirven al Perú o a la antipatria

20081019123055AAAAIWV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is there any recourse for an illegal property search?	I have a horse boarding stable, I got a new boarder with 4 horses in a few weeks ago.  The animals came in in terrible shape from another boarding facility.  A week after I got them here my neighbor called me at work and said that the Humane Society had been to my house.  The 4 new horses were part of a investigation that started in another county.  This humane officer came in my barn, searched my barn and took pictures without my knowledge or permission, she came back the next day and seized the horses (the owner now has them back).  I was never served with a warrant, they were never given permission to search, and I never saw a warrant when they took the horses (my animals were never in question as a matter of fact the HS complimented me on my fantastic facility).  I am now out some time and about $1000 a month board because the horses were removed illegally, and the agency that took the horses were not even from my county..  Is this a case that an attorney would take?
20081027205246AAIiDaH	Politics & Government;Politics	How can Obama possibly be preaching hate when people are trying to kill him?	How is it that the McCain/Palin supporters attend these hate rallies, throw the racial slurs at Obama, and conspire to kill him but still claim that Obama and his supporters (the smart people of the nation) are playing the race card?      The Republican candidates themselves are partially to blame. They paint Obama as a terrorist, a socialist (even though the political right is closer to socialism than the left, but whatever), a Muslim, etc. and the hate seeps down and emboldens their supporters.      Hell, Gordon Liddy, a German descent, is an ardent admirer of Adolf Hitler. He is on record as advising his radio listners to shoot agents of Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearms in the head. And John McCain pals around this guy and hold funraising event in his house and declares he is proud of his friendship with him.      Yet you Repuke fools won't dare voice any concern about that. You won't dare call McCan'ts "patriotism" into question, even though his friend admires a man that fought against the United States in the biggest war in human history.      MCCAIN-PALIN NEW CHANT...

20081107101541AAbl0AX	Politics & Government;Government	Why do so many of us have this idea that a President is supposed to be all-powerful and fix all our problems?	God knows I love Barack Obama, and I agree with most of his positions.  But even he keeps telling us that he cannot do this alone, that real change will require us all to hang in there and work together.  Yet, I see so many posts here in YA! and elsewhere insinuating that Obama is bound to mess up.  Negative prophecies are often self-fulfilling prophecies.  When are we going to wake up and realize that the U.S.A. is governed by the people, for the people?  When are we going to stop seeing the President as a savior or Messiah and then, like little children, get upset when he turns out to have flaws.  All our greatest leaders had serious flaws:  King, Kennedy, Gandhi...      What do you think?  What are you willing to do to become a real citizen and help?

Also, The police officer asked to see my phone, and i asked him if he can legally do that, and he said he can? I didnt want to give him my phone because he heard a txt message go off so he put me in an arm lock, and told me that they are going through in investigation, the cop put me in an arm lock and asked if i wanted to go to jail.. Then took my phone and forced me to unlock it. Is that legal?  Then they told us all to write appology letters which is probably a confession and can my confession be used in court if the only reason they got me was because of what was on my phone?

20090220123353AA5rWFs	Politics & Government;Politics	The most logical move for the Obama administration to make right now?	So now Obama's bill is signed it is no longer in just the government's hands, but ours. There seems to be a growing number of skeptics to the bill, but for the bill to be successful there MUST be confidence in him.      I do not understand why it has taken so long, but I think now is the time to tell all of the people who don't read true free-press or foreign news in the United States that 911 was in fact an inside job.      If you don't believe, I beg you to watch one of the 100's of movies, 1000's of direct quotes taken from wiithin Bush's administration,1000's of published articles from the freest presses around the world (Australia, France, and the media not controlled in some way by the government inside the US), and thousands of little pieces of common sense that just don't add up.      Anyways, I am not trying to convince you, "Ignorance is bliss" has a new meaning these days. This meaning seems to somehow override the most basic levels of practical morality that will shatter the world if not kept in check.      What is your opinion of why Obama has not brought it up yet?      Yes, it could result in a drop in people's confidence in the government, but if handled perfectly, Obama can easily avoid that backlash by separating himself even further from the Bush Administration.      Hell, Obama did take the Churchill statue out of the oval office! :-)      I think he is setting up for it.      What do you think?   .

20090220130817AAnTS8V	Politics & Government;Politics	Where in the world is GW Bush?	Less than a month after leaving office Bill Clinton was already out raking in the cash at various speaking engagements and continued to do so at an amazing rate. He was able to do this DESPITE having been caught with his pants down in the Oval Office!!! Millions of prudish, sheltered Americans suffered horribly by having to hear about oral sex month after month after month...but still Bill raked in the cash!      It has been one month exactly since GW snuck out the back door of the White House, into a waiting limo and whisked away...and that was the last we saw of him.      No performances at Bob Jones U...no performances on Rush's show...no stints working for Fox News as a political analyst like his buddy Rove...no picketing American soldiers funerals with Fred Phelps because of all the hated gays in the USA...nada, zippo, nothing.      I mean come on, GW was the most successful, most loved, most popular President in American history...why is the man hiding?      How soon will it be before Morgan Spurlock makes a documentary called "Where in the World is George Walker Bush?"      Is there a cave on the Texas Ranch where Bush is suffering the same fate as the guy he let get away...Osama bin Laden? Are they both in the SAME CAVE?

It cost the tax payers over 1.5 million just for Obama plus millions more for government big wigs just to put on a show. This all could have been done in Washington and save we the tax payers millions. Talk about waste. How can he warn and scar anyone else when he is not willing to do his part

20090203075520AADBMdH	Politics & Government;Elections	Another Dem with tax problems, what a pack of thieves you folks elected?	and like all Dems, they blame it on someone else.      President Obama’s Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Tom Daschle have been getting some attention regarding their failure to pay taxes, but what about Al Franken?      Franken, who is still fighting incumbent GOP Sen. Norm Coleman for Minnesota’s Senate seat, failed to pay at least $70,000 in taxes to 17 states prior to running for office.      Minnesota’s Star Tribune reported Franken was paid to appear at a number of celebrity appearances across the country and file taxes appropriately in those states since 2003. Franken’s team released a spreadsheet to media detailing the debt through the campaign, but there has not been any verification Franken has actually paid them down yet.      Franken refused to answer questions and blamed his attorney Allen Chanzis for the error-- much like Geithner blamed the mass-market tax software for his failure to pay $34,000 in taxes.

I have heard that if a person lives outside of the state of NJ and wishes to clear up an old (1 year old) Traffic ticket in Municipal court, a lawyer can represent the client in Court because it would be an undue hardship for the person to come halfway across the country to go to Court. This is assuming, of course, that copies of the detainer and Leter of epresentation have been provided to the Municipal Court. The signed Attorney can then represent the person in court, and dispose of the matter.      My question is: Is this still true? I may be the personneeding to dispose of 3 driving tickets in a town in New Jersey. I have pursued my work, and am wondering if NJ Municipal Court still works this way w driving tickets.

Currency is a measure of money the same way a clock measures time. (i.e.) money is created when people take a pile of lumber , pipe , drywall etc. worth say 1x and turn it into a house worth 20x. People create money  , the Federal Reserve creates currency. Currency by itself is almost worthless.  It takes millions of people working to create our money supply so doesn't that mean that the people own the money supply and NOT the Federal Reserve NOR our elected officials?  (a very abbreviated explanation I know)  Your opinion on this please.

Here is the article that appears in the Philadelphia Inquirer today.      Devon charter school sues parents   By Martha Woodall       Inquirer Staff Writer      Several parents at the Agora Cyber Charter School in Devon who asked questions about the school's finances have been sued by the founder and her management company.    Dorothy June Brown contends that the parents and the Agora Parent Organization defamed her and Cynwyd Group L.L.C. in complaints sent to the state Department of Education and in e-mails circulated to other parents at the statewide cyber school.      The parents say they were just trying to get answers about the relationship between Cynwyd Group and Agora. The cyber school rents its headquarters from Cynwyd under a nine-year lease and pays the firm a management fee of at least 4 percent, according to a services agreement. Brown owns Cynwyd and serves as its senior consultant to Agora, according to school and state records.      The civil suit Brown filed in Montgomery County Court on Jan. 21 alleges that the parents made misleading statements "that give the clear but false impression that Dr. Brown is corrupt, incompetent and possibly criminal."      The suit also says the parents' association "sought to interfere with Cynwyd's contractual relationship with Agora by spreading untruths about Dr. Brown and by implying that she had improperly used public funds."      Brown and Cynwyd are seeking more than $150,000 in damages for libel, slander and civil conspiracy.      "The allegations are false," Gladys Stefany of Milton, Pike County, said in an e-mail yesterday. She said she learned about the suit last Tuesday when she was served with papers.         'Civil conspiracy'    "When did asking for information that is or should be public information become 'civil conspiracy?' " asked Stefany, who has a 15-year-old daughter enrolled in Agora and is president of the parents' organization.    "It is sad that it has come to this, but I'm happy we'll finally have the opportunity to air our case in the open and get answers to our questions."      Stefany said the questions did not involve the school's academic program. She said she was more than satisfied with the instruction her special-needs daughter has received.      News of the suit left several lawyers and education officials scratching their heads.      "I haven't heard of a case of this sort in recent memory," Len Reiser, co-director of the Education Law Center in Center City, said yesterday.      Lawyers from the Pennsylvania School Boards Association agreed.         SLAPP suit?    Angelique Smith of Aston and her husband, Ira, are among the six parents named in the complaint. She said she believed the case amounted to what is known as a "strategic lawsuit against public participation" (SLAPP) and was meant to intimidate and silence critics.    "This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of association," Smith said. "This is akin to going to a regular public school and telling the PTA to get out."      Brown referred all questions about the suit to her attorney, Wendy Beetlestone. Beetlestone said it was a defamation case and not a SLAPP suit.       "In any kind of public discussion, you have to make sure that what you say is true and doesn't bring down the reputation of the person you're talking about," Beetlestone said.      She said parents had failed to respond to requests to stop spreading information that she said defamed Brown.      "June Brown is a highly respected and innovative educator and has been for many years," Beetlestone said. "When the debate turns to making false statements and doing everything they can to bring her down, she is left with no other option. That's what this lawsuit is about."      Brown is the founder of three traditional charter schools in Philadelphia. In 2005, she and Brien N. Gardiner, founder of the Philadelphia Academy Charter School in Northeast Philadelphia, co-founded Agora to provide online home instruction to students across the state.       The school Web site listed Gardiner as a co-founder, but his name was removed in May after he became the subject of a federal criminal investigation at Philadelphia Academy and was fired from his consulting position at the charter.      The lawsuit against the parents claims Gardiner "had no role in founding Agora and his name does not appear in Agora's application for a charter or in subsequent organizational documents."      Brown's lawsuit also charges that Agora parents tried to imply that she "was guilty of some financial wrongdoing on the basis of her association with Gardiner."      Records show that Brown and Gardiner did business together. In 2005, they established Cynwyd Group as an educational management company, state records show.      In November 2007, the company paid $1.9 million to buy a property at 60 Chestnut Ave., Tredyffrin, that houses the Agora headquarters. The relationship between Gardiner and Brown was severed in May 2008.      Gardiner and others were removed from Philadelphia Ac

We are a British family currently resident in the USA  I am on a blanket'' L1 visa and my spouse, plus 3 children are on L2 visas. They expire in 2010.     We will be leaving the US shortly as my employment ends soon, which also means our visas expire.     We would like to get a definitive answer on how long we can stay in the USA after our employment ends. We need a few weeks to get our household and affairs in order, and would also like to spend 2 weeks on holiday in the USA before returning to the UK, travelling to several states to visit friends and see the country, so would like to fly with a couple of layovers in US cities. An 40 extra days would more than suffice.     I have telephoned the USCIS but they cannot give me a definite answer - they say it is too detailed a question, but also say that it "should not be a problem". However we would like something in writing in case we encounter problems on leaving.     Can you please tell me where I can find a concrete and final official answer to this question?
