Notice how he likes to constantly bring up the fact that he's biracial, as if that makes him more attractive. And people who say i'm this, I'm that, I'm sexy, look at me...are the most insecure people, and always need validation to feel good about themselves. Honestly, this is why I'm never dating interracial guys because a lot of them put on this front like the fact that their skin and eyes are lighter that they are somehow sexier than darker shaded men. Ugh, I can't stand guys like this. Do you agree?

20090304155005AANXDEo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?What annoys Jews more? JWs claiming HaShem is Jehovah & the Tanakh says so OR Xians calling Jesus Messiah?	I am just curious here, since i just answered a question in which 8 cult members TD'd the mess out of my answer, because I stated that "Jehovah" is NOT the sacred Name.        http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       As a Christian, naturally I believe in Christ; BUT i am well aware that little to none of those of the Jewish Faith accept Him as Messiah. And those deemed Messianic Jews are considered by Orthodox and/or Contemporary Jews as Apostates. (So, i try to be respectful). (Long story short the extended family is Jewish, and practices).       That being said, Most Christians (including myself) get extremely annoyed with the pontificating of various pseudo-christian cults that profess to know "literal greek" and "literal hebrew" when they do not.   (I know limited words and definitions, but i do not put on pretense). Also, it is extremely annoying to Real Jews who actually DO know Hebrew.       So anyways, I am just wondering: Which of the TWO things is more annoying to a Real (practicing) Jew?   1) JWs and various PC Cults claiming "Jehovah" is the Divine Name in Scripture, OR   2) Jesus (Yeshua) is the Messiah?      Thanks. xoxo ?

I was tested as haplogroup K, and it's described as follows:      "The marker M9 first appeared in a man born around 40,000 years ago in present day Iran or south-central Asia.  This marked a new lineage diverging from the M89 Middle Eastern clan.  His descendants spent the next 30,000 years populating much of the planet.      This large lineage, called the Eurasian Clan, dispersed gradually over thousands of years.  Seasoned hunters followed the herds ever eastward, along the vast 'highway' of the Eurasian Steppe.   Eventually their path was blocked by the massive mountain ranges of south-central Asia: the Hindu Kush, the Tian Shan and the Himalayas.  These three mountain ranges meet in the center of a region known as the Pamir Knot, located in present-day Tajikistan.  Here the tribes of hunters split into two main groups.  Some moved north into central Asia, others moved south into what is now Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent.  These different migration routes through the Pamir Knot region gave rise to separate lineages.  Most people of the Northern Hemisphere trace their roots to the Eurasian Clan.  Nearly all North Americans and East Asians are descended from this man, as are most Europeans and many Indians."       http://www.kknfa.org/haplogroups.htm       Should I believe all this stuff?

I think it’s one of the adorable little idiosyncrasies of Christians; you know, you can be having an email debate with one over something simple like, evidence of their god and comparing their god to other mythical entities. And they say something absurd like, “God doesn’t require evidence; God is UNCONDITIONALLY true regardless of evidence!” At this stage, all you can do is throw up your hands and say, “I can’t argue with you. You’re clearly not interested in a rational debate and you clearly don’t understand what constitutes an assertion without evidence.” Then the adorable little douchebags say something like, “I ‘owned’ you! Admit it; you can’t stand up to my logic.” Don’t you just love that?

So, according to this doctor, it is "divine providence" - its a freaking MIRACLE - that this lone guy survived a 46 hour ordeal at sea.       Has the doctor taken into consideration that this guy was a professional athlete who had better musculature than the typical person? Had the doctor considered the fact that this guy sat on the top of an overturned boat for those 46 hours, so he wasn't exactly exposed to 46 straight hours of 68* water??       Has the doctor considered the fact that three other men are MISSING AND PRESUMED DEAD - yet this was a miracle?       Why does God reach down and effect a miracle by saving one guy, whilst simultaneously allowing three others to die horrible deaths???      I think the doctor should have his medical license suspended for practicing religion in a medical office.

All these links say that Europeans came from Asia between 12,000 and 15,000 years, and they didn't push upward until 10,000 years ago! I have a lot more resources that confirm it!     http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...     http://indoeuro.bizland.com/project/chro...     http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1525/...             No, Native Americans are not related to Asians.   No, Native Americans are not Mongolian, not a single Native American came from Mongolia.      DNA has proven   ? Native Americans had no Asian connection for at least 40,000 years.   ? Native American DNA is unique to Native Americans…… Native Americans are not genetically similar to any other world population because they were isolated for so long.    ? Native Americans are a single founding population…… There were no other populations in the America before or after the current Native American population.       Native Americans have no relationship to Europeans. The only relationship Native Americans have to Asians is a back flow of Native American DNA into Asia.      Europeans, have a closer relationship with Asians then Native Americans, because those populations were in Asia during the Last Glacial Maximum. (20,000 years ago)      2008 - About 40,000 years ago.....The early generations began to move out of Siberia into Beringia.    http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gXL-...

20090304164207AACfQlD	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Need some advice , do you think I should pay ? What would you do ?	Long story , but I'll make it short.I had some family problems and stayed w/a friend. She said my two dogs and I could stay with her for as long as i needed for $125 a week. We agreed it would only be about a month, so I could find a place. I never added up how much $125/wek would be, but i ended up paying her $550 total for less then a month. While I was there my dogs and I had to stay in this ONE room and were not allowed in other parts of the house. So all i did was use that room and the bathroom. IN her house there was 10 yr. old nasty blue carpet that hadn't been changed in ten years. Well I found a place and was moving out but I had paid her up until that next wednesday, but she said I needed to leave that sun. because her landlord found out there were dogs there, but she refused to give me my money for the next 4 days (since I had already paid her) So i moved late that saturday night & was just gonna let that go. I then called and offered to bring over my dad's big shampooer to clean her carpet in that room because of the dog hairs. They HAD to stay in there 24/7 & there was hair on the carpet and the vacuum didn't get it all up. She never answered me then about a week later she got fired from her job and then 3 days later called me and said my dogs reuined her carpet and I needed to pay to have new carpet put in. I then told her I would bring the shampooer over,and she said she had already pulled up the carpet. WTF. So i told her I was NOT going to do that and I did not owe her anything. I paid her a total of $550 when her rent was $850 and her, her 2 kids, and boyfriend lived there. They ate all my food in the fridge, I gave her $10 in gas at least 4 ti mes while staying with her, She didn't give me my money for making me leave early.. So my thing is she keep calling my work 5 times a day asking them if they know if i had gotten my tax return and when I get paid...; then coming to my job. Just last week she said " i know you get paid on the 5th and I will be up there to get money for my carpet" I don't know what to do. I have kept my cool this far but am about to blow up and really need to keep this away from my job, but for some reason she refused to call my cell.... What can I do?      So basicly I don't think I need to put new carpet in when I could of shampooed it and it would of looked better then it had in a long time since it was 10 yrs. old., but she didn't give me a chance to b4 she pulled it up. Also she owed me money. She also told mutual friends of ours when she got fired she would do ANYTHING TO GET MONEY.... and we have a txt to prove it... so then she calls me and tries to get that money from me and wants me to pay her not a company... ARE YOU SERIOUS... Please any advice would be greatly appericated...

20090304161512AA1ysL9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should women have to register to have children?	What if, once a young woman began her period, she took a shot required by government that disable her from getting pregnant? Then, once she's old enough, she can decide to have a child, gets another shot after people check her mental stability and ability to take care of a child, and gets pregnant within a year? (Assume there would be very little chance of her becoming permanently infertile.)       Pros: If this happened, there would be extremely few unwanted pregnanies, virtually no abortions, and the children up for adoption would have more chances of having a family. Also, the children born would have stable families. Child abuse and poverty would decrease and they'd have a greater chance to succeed.      Cons: People might have careless sex without condoms and the like, increasing the risk for STDs. The shots could be sold in the black market and recreational use could be dangerous and perhaps make somebody permanently infertile.      I don't think this will ever happen. But if it were an option in the future, would you support it or oppose it? And list your reasons.

20090304162153AAmIgSB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is he bisexual??? Or, am I losing my mind?	I have a friend/romantic interest whom I suspect to be bisexual. Typically, I would just come right out and ask, but I doubt he would tell me the truth. So, I'm here to ask, if maybe my suspicions are valid. Here's what I'm going off of:      1. It's in my gut (intuition).   2. He's never had a stable female relationship.   3. When he talks about relationships with women he seems to be "at war" with himself.   4. When I suggested that none of my straight friends will ever go to a gay club with me, he said "I'll go." Then proceeded to ask questions like, "are there alot of men?" "what is the scene like?" etc...      Now, I'm sure you are wondering why do I care!?! Well, here's the thing...I am very attracted to him, and he has admitted that he is attracted to me as well. We are beginning to pursue these feelings, however, I am apprehensive that he may be on the "DL." I could care less if he does like men, to each their own, however, I have issues with dating bisexual men from previous experience. I dated a man that I had no idea was on the DL, and found out years later that he was sleeping with men when we were dating and had contracted HIV...scaring me nearly to death (I tested negative, thankfully) and ruining the idea that I would ever entertain a relationship with a bisexual man, again.      So, I guess I'm kind of asking two questions...Could he be bisexual, and how do I ask him?

20090227083351AAgOYy7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you think this is racist? and why?	I was talking about watching To Kill a Mockingbird on the Showtime Black channel (maybe it was Starz Black).        A co-worker began complaining that it's not fair that black people can have an all black channel, but if white people had an all white channel people would call it racist.      I think it would be racist but I couldn't really explain why. I think most channels cater to white people anyway, and we don't really need a channel devoted to whiteness.      Maybe the all black networks are racist, but they really don't bother me as a white person because I like to be informed about other cultures. And besides that, most of the people in To Kill a Mockingbird were white anyway.        It kind of gets to me when white people feel jealous that there's no white history month. I don't have an problem with any one culture wanting special recognition.  For example if they were complaining that there's no Irish-American History month that would be one thing, but I think white people already have a big advantage in society and don't really need special recognition just for being white.      I mentioned to my co-worker that white people came over here by their own choice and most African decedents were forced here and she said, "Give me a break, that was like over 150 years ago"  But at the same time if you make jokes about the Irish potato famine Irish people get REALLY offended, even though that was 160 years ago as well.       I think because of the stereotypes of blacks in a white dominant society it's harder for black people to get ahead, but I don't think my co-worker can grasp that concept.  I think she is a racist now.      What are your thoughts?

20090306140314AAWarJw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	We were having a class discussion about Huck Finn...?	And how that book, along with other books, uses the N word alot. I'm in accelerated English, and my teacher found this article about separation of race in the classroom, and we had to read that article, then have a discussion about it. We were basically talking about why the N word is so wrong, and how it impacts people alot. Then this white girl in the class was saying a comment, and she said the N word. Now there are 3 black kids in the class, and i'm one of them. We just sorta cringed when she said it, because it made us uncomfortable. Then my teacher was like, you can tell that you guys were shocked that she said that because your faces tightened up and you got tense. Then she and the whole class kept asking us questions. But in the article, some people said they want books like Huck Finn, of mice and men, to kill a mockingbird, etc. To be banned from school reading lists because they don't want their kids learning about slavery and racism because we are in the age of Obama, and racism is far behind us. I just thought the comments were mind boggling. I mean, the whole point of learning about history is so that you don't forget it, and so it never happens again. I would want my child to know about slavery and racism, so in case they ever did encounter racism, it wouldn't be a total shock to them.       What do you guys think about this? Do you think Books that talk about slavery/racism and use the N word heavily should be banned?

I just started wondering about this a few seconds ago after someone on Yahoo Answers correctly referred to me as female other then the usual boy(though,I don't mind be called a boy at all).      :/ Is it the default gender for everything?      Most people will refer to an animal they don't know the sex of as a male.   People often refer to be on the internet as male,unless it is explicitly given somehow.   A lot of people refer to babies who aren't born yet,or genders aren't known yet,as being male.       There are more males right,so is that why?

20090306160652AABeOVU	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What are you doing for Comic Relief?	I wanted to do something extra fun this year but am having trouble choosing from two ideas. My sister is a teacher in a Primary School, so I have basically decided to use that school and get the kids of this school and other local Primary Schools involved. We (me, my friends and my sisters) have already organised the Cake Sale, mini games for small prizes and Karaoke etc. I wanted one main event though, and I either need to choose from a Treasure Hunt or a Car Wash.      The Treasure Hunt will be throughout the whole school, where they read clues in teams and find prizes along the way.      The Car Wash will basically be washing the cars, in the school car park, that belong to teachers and parents, where a group of kids can have a car each with sponges, buckets of water, washing up powder, etc. Where they will wash while wearing silly red outfits and having a water fight at the same time. The winners will be the ones that have washed it the best, after inspection by me or my sisters or someone.      The Car Wash seems more fun, but could be dangerous, although there will be supervisors with each group....      What do you think?...or maybe I can borrow one of your ideas... please?      Thanx for answering =)

I'm "Black" and I don't use slang, I don't dress in hip-hop attire, I don't wear weave (I grow my own hair), and I listen to alternative rock music.      What the heck am I?      Black or not Black?      OF COURSE I"M BLACK!      What you mean to say is IGNORANT.      People want to act ignorant.      Although I agree that people like to adopt mainstream Black culture.      When Whites, Hispanics, and Asians try to act ignorant(what you call "Black") I think they look ridiculous.      It saddens me to see this.      I especially can't stand when they try to steal aspects of "Black" culture.      They did it 50 years ago and they are still doing it now.      When Elvis adopted "Black" culture, people thought that it was cool.      I think Justin Timberlake definitely tries to act "Black" too.      I'm not even White and I find this to be shameful.      I thought that he was just a wannabe and everyone else can definitely see it.

Do you see yourselves as more closely aligned with traditional Christianity, i.e. the Catholic church, or with the fundamentalist movement?      The reason I ask is, so much of what I see in Lutheran services is so similar to a Catholic service, everything from baptizing infants to the latin names in the parts of service (the credo, agnus dei, etc.) and the creeds, etc.  And yet Lutherans believe in sola scriptura and (correct me if I'm wrong ) faith alone rather than faith plus works.

20090306161432AAGQM6W	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My LGBT friends, help me out? (read)?	My friend kissed me today, soo....      Well, I've been sort of sneaking out of class to go see her, just to give her a hug and talk, then I'd go back to class. So today I was about to leave..and.. she kissed me. : )   I was all, "ha..." I blushed and was about to walk away, these girls said to her, "wow, you kiss everyone!"   Big turn off.      I saw her at a show a couple days ago, she was totally all over my friend's ex, and she wasn't over him. She was holding his hand, hugging him, whatever, and yesterday I found out she's been having sex with him.      I sort of liked her, thinking about that makes me sort of uncomfortable, and...I don't know.         I'm texting her now, I asked why she kissed me and said she's wanted to for a really long time, and that I'm beautiful.         My questions: What do I do/say?   Do you think she's leading me on?

20090227084611AAXhr5S	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of these words of teh niece of Dr. martin Luther King Jr.?	Dr. Alveda C. King, reflections on “Letter from a Birmingham Jail”       The abortion agenda is in direct conflict with the teachings of Dr. King.       In 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr., a non-violent supporter of natural family planning, received the Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger Award. In his acceptance speech, Dr. King pointed to the benefits of family planning among ***** families and the "kinship" between the civil rights movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts.       His hopeful speech would not include abortion: "Our sure beginning in the struggle for equality by non-violent direct action may not have been so resolute without the tradition established by Margaret Sanger and people like her."       As Dr. King’s niece, I too once accepted the lies of Planned Parenthood until the truth of the violence of abortion was revealed to me. If Planned Parenthood had announced that over 50 million babies would be aborted in the onslaught of their agenda, I would never have aborted a child.        http://www.catholic.org/national/nationa...

20090227083522AAQbHmR	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Re: Invitation to Islam as per order of Allah?	Despite people's hatred, jealousy & criticism towards Islam, more & more people, especially some famous ones, are becoming attracted to Islam. With that said, I will take this opportunity to invite (and NOT force) members here to accept Islam as their way of life.      Dear members, I intend no disrespect. Islam is destined to become dominant over all other religions. Look at this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyxl85C12...  see how many famous people have converted to Islam, and ponder over why Islam is becoming the fastest growing religion around the world.      Please keep in mind that Islam, while being the "key" to heaven, still forbids Muslims from forcing others to convert to it. At the same time, it requires, and by that I mean "it is the duty" of every Muslim to at least, simply 'invite' towards the way of Allah, Islam.  Whether or not you convert is a matter of personal business between you and Allah. It is thus the severe torment of Allah, which I must warn you of, on His behalf, should you choose to reject the invitation.      Please do not get angry at us for fulfilling our duty.      Thanks.

Ive been to black clubs, worked at a few...and it IS noticable and different.      Do you not understand that you NOT tipping will cause the price to escalate as over the months the bar will HAVE to pay more to KEEP employees? Other bars in the area will match the prices...and then you lose. Your tips are part of the price, and keep dink costs down!      Do you realize that most clubs implement a dress code and door cover charge to keep people of color OUT...they realize that if we dont pay a cover charge, were more likely not to tip.

I mean why?? why is it that we can't we have a fair share at life? can't we get a scholarship without people calling us racist for working hard and achieving?      scholarships for minorities would not have even been created if white people hadn't had whites only schools and scholarships.

I have been asked for my assistance to play guitar for an Easter Vigil mass at a Catholic church. I am Jewish. Anyway, I played some Spanish style chord progressions and the music director, the church deacon, thought he wanted to include it during the communion music. I am calling it "Jesus, Maria, y Jose" as a working title. It has a Segovia style to it. Are there any Segovia pieces written about Jesus?  I picked up some Segovia CDs at a music store in the city and I have been listening to the music, studying it for ideas. What are some well known Latin classical guitar pieces written about Jesus and the Passions and Easter? I am trying to capture the music I heard at a Portuguese mass in Bermuda, that was a black guy from Bermuda playing classical guitar at the mass.

My career goals are to become an immunologist and study allergies or macrophages (a white blood cell). I realized that in my major and future career that I would have to confront evolution a lot. I really don't plan on talking about evolution in my research papers when I start writing them because I don't think that theory is scientifically correct as in the creation of the world. So, therefore I won't talk about it. I know that by me saying this that I would get a lot of criticism from non-Christians and even a few Christians. Believe me, ever since I started college I have met Christians that believe in evolution theory. I was wandering how my beliefs would affect my research. I don't think it would affect my research that much because I know of some scientists that are Christians.

The assignment is very open and is to create a piece of art from a newspaper headline (past or present) I was considering doing something on sex-positive feminism which started in the 80's...       I was thinking of painting myself one color and partners (would actually only use one partner) but continue to paint him different colors and keep my color the same (giving illusion that what happened on the canvas was between a woman and several guys at different times, which could speak to progression of women's ability to objectify men. We would have to strategically place ourselves in woman dominating positions enough that viewer may guess what is going on.       My question is how can I make this read as more feminist so when critiquing the viewer may see this? I was thinking of throwing a burnt bra on the canvas? I know its cliche and from feminism of the 60's not the 80's like sex-positive feminism started... But I need the viewer to read this as feminist... is there anything I could add besides just imprints of naked bodies to make it more feminist without being too cliche?       Specific colors? I could do "hot" colors popular in the 80's... haha      Any creative ideas will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!!

20090306212430AAnJQQ5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Did you always have an older person, a Grandparent to go to for advise?	I didnt, I never had a grandmother or a mother I could go to. Thankfully in those days neighbours were still neighbours and when things got rough at home I could trundle my little 3 year old legs over to my "aunties" for hugs and cookies. When I got older I could write to my real aunt who lived in a different province. I dont know what I would have done without this kind of support and encouragement.       A lot of kids DONT have someone they can go to. If they seek out the Senior Citizen section, to ask a "grandparent" kind of person for advise, or what we think, why do so many of you have a problem with that lately?        We used to welcome these young people and enjoy having them here, but lately people are just answering "you are in the wrong section". Have we all turned into cold unfeeling people all of a sudden? Have you thought that if you are mean they just might come back with their friends to harass us? What happened to "the Seniors answer site is full of nice caring people who give caring answers to everyone who comes here with a legitimate question?"       I'm not trying to stir up trouble, I am genuinely puzzled by this.

I mean, I know I haven't had a real boyfriend (im shy with guys), but that's still no reason for her to worry; she knows I still like boys nevertheless!

20090306200646AAfOLGh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think a BIBLICAL PANDEMIC might  happen with a Virus Mix-UP?	I have heard this 2x today    http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Healt...       NaturalNews) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that the nation is unprepared for the true effects of a pandemic such as that expected from avian flu.      The department conducted a survey of the emergency preparedness plans of all 50 states, five territories and the District of Columbia. It concluded that while most of the country is well prepared to distribute vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat an influenza pandemic, this forms only one small part of what needs to be done.      Transportation plans for a pandemic are still far from adequate, the department says. Furthermore, many states and territories are still planning as if a pandemic would be only a short incident, rather than months of social and economic disruption that could easily spread across the world.      Health experts now accept that some sort of pandemic will inevitably strike the United States -- most likely a mutant variation on the highly lethal avian flu strain H5N1, which has infected and killed 394 and 248 people to date, respectively. Currently, the disease does not pass easily to or between humans, but researchers worry that it would take only a few simple mutations for that to change.      Virus mix-up by lab could have resulted in pandemic   It's emerged that virulent H5N1 bird flu was sent out by accident from an Austrian lab last year and given to ferrets in the Czech Republic before anyone realised. As well as the risk of it escaping into the wild, the H5N1 got mixed with a human strain, which might have spawned a hybrid that could unleash a pandemic.       Last December, the Austrian branch of US vaccine company Baxter sent a batch of ordinary human H3N2 flu, altered so it couldn't replicate, to Avir Green Hills Biotechnology, also in Austria. In February, a lab in the Czech Republic working for Avir alerted Baxter that, unexpectedly, ferrets inoculated with the sample had died. It turned out the sample contained live H5N1, which Baxter uses to make vaccine. The two seem to have been mixed in error.

20090306213103AAFkTc4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	1 Cor. 5:1-5 Does Not Support Eternal Security,.. Or dose it?	There is nothing in 1 Cor. 5:1-5 or anywhere else in the Bible that teaches the deadly doctrine of eternal security. On at least three counts eternal security is not taught in 1 Cor. 5.   1. The unnamed man of 1 Cor. 5:1 was guilty of sexual immorality. This same person is referred to in v. 13 as wicked.   Expel the wicked man from among you (1 Cor. 5:13).   The same Greek word translated wicked in that verse is also found in Mt. 13:49,50:   This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.   Hence, the unnamed man of 1 Cor. 5:1 couldn’t be saved and be headed for the fiery furnace at the same time like that man!   2. Also, the same word translated sexual immorality in 1 Cor. 5:1 is found in Gal. 5:19-21:   The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.   Therefore, people such as those mentioned in 1 Cor. 5:1, will not inherit the kingdom of God because of this type of sin. Instead, they are headed for the fiery furnace, as recently proven. (To not inherit the kingdom of God is to be thrown into the fiery furnace.)   3. 1 Cor. 5:5 speaks of an action that needed to be done to that wicked man so that he may be saved. (Eternal security proponents with itching ears have been wrongly taught may be saved means is saved at this moment and want to believe it). Those same words found in v. 5, may be saved are found just 5 chapters later in 1 Cor. 10:33 and clearly refer to those who need to be saved, not those saved at this moment:   Even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.   This passage in 1 Cor. 5:5 that has been violently twisted, in a deadly attempt to allow for saints (or holy ones) to be sexually immoral, shows the license for immorality that eternal security really is. We can produce numerous quotes from respected and esteemed so-called “Christian” teachers that teach this poisonous doctrine of eternal security. For example, Dave Hunt wrote:   The man who had “his father’s wife”—a terrible sin—didn’t lose his salvation thereby.   All eternal security teachers are very dangerous people, with no exception. Please read our other supporting article on this    God’s Truth   The truth is: There are not two types of sexually immoral people as the eternal security teachers want us to think—one that is saved because in the past he was regenerated and one that is unsaved because he never was regenerated. There is only one type of sexually immoral person and he is always an unsaved person headed for the fiery furnace and in desperate need of forgiveness   The eternal security teachers have distorted 1 Cor. 5, which teaches the sexually immoral man was unsaved, into the exact opposite of what it really says. That has opened a door for multitudes of immoral people to think they are still saved even though they are now in this same type of wickedness. Where are the true teachers that will stand opposed to the big names and this doctrine of demons?   To be forgiven, turn from your sins and place your submissive faith (trust) 100% in the Jewish Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth.    MUCH more related information on eternal security is found in our never-to-be-refuted book, “The Believer’s Conditional Security.”      Supporting URL..   http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/estea...

20090306211430AAd8GxO	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	So theres a certain someone......?	I find myself falling for this guy in my school, but i feel conflicted about those feelings because i'm unsure about his orientation. But i know for sure i like him, cus everytime i see him i get butterflies in my stomach and feel like i can do anything! his laugh is heartwarming and his smile makes me feel like life is great *sighs*. It started out as a first glance attraction, then it grew into deeper affection, he's friends with my friends so i got to know him better that way. AND!(storytime) while i was helping my friends out with painting a set for this play (which he was in) and we all laughed and horsed around as usual, but in the midst of all that he said "aw i love ya arthur" and all i could say back was "well thats great" in a low voice like i was'nt paying much attention. I feel like an idiot for doing that lol. and he said it again! while we were finishing the set design after school today (could'nt believe my ears) SO the main question is....should i pursue this and hopefully have a happy ever after? or let it be?       BTW, i've only come out to like 4 people in my school (close friends and best friend, who introduced us ironically) but i don't feel the need to make an issue of coming out, and just let people figure out on their own, cus atleast i came out to myself :]

20090306213449AAgZbyE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, did your parents talk with you about sex?	Growing up in a conservative Christian family, my parents hardly talked to us about sex & sexuality, only mostly about God's word and their childhood sufferings (in another country).  I feel a little bit more comfortable talking with my mom about such things than with my dad.   Whenever I read or hear about how some other parents talked to their kids about such, I get sad & upset at my parents for the lack of education from them in this area(not that I did anything wild or anything, I'm still a virgin).  When I've asked my mom so many times the reason they haven't educated us about it, she doesn't really answer me, and tells me I should just learn it through "sexual orientation" class.  I know that in the spiritual area, they did an excellent parenting job, however, I feel they've done very poorly in this area.  I've educated myself on sexuality through Christian books(what I feel mostly matches with my spiritual belief)  because I tried to take Human Sexuality course at a community college once, and I had to drop it because whatever they were teaching was very contrary to my belief & the textbook had some very explicit images of same sex couples' "actions", etc.  Anyways, am I the only one who has parents who never or hardly talk about sexuality or are there more of me out there?

I can't invite you over to my house and let you talk to the people that were healed. I'm telling you truthfully about my experiences. And all you're going to say back is you're lying.

It seems to me that it would be a lot easier to stay ignorant and just live life worrying about the trivial things in life, then die. It would keep our primitive brain occupied, but alas, it seems not enough to satisfy our urge to find out more. We must search but why? What is the point?

He has some...effeminate qualities. He's super sweet and charming, and I have a crush on him.      I never would have guessed he were gay until recently he seems to flirt with me in class and tells me he really enjoys my company.       I've started to suspect him especially after he text messaged me the other morning before school with just a smiley face. We also joke often about getting really intimate but I've started to realize that I would like to get intimate with him, not just in fantasy or joking.       The problem is that I don't know if I should let him know how I feel. He says he's tolerant of everyone and doesn't discriminate based on sexual orientation. However, he also says he's straight.      Confused? I am too.       Any advice?

I am a lesbian and my girlfriend and I had a little fight. When we went to bed, she told me that she needed space. So, I slept on the floor. I woke up in the middle of the night and she was snuggled right next to me. When I woke up for the day, she was back in bed. I am most certain that she wasn't sleep walking.  My question is if I should ask about what she did? I mean, I didn't mind. But if I did ask about it, I have no idea if she would get mad? Does she not want me to know what she did? I am asking because she made it clear that she needed space when she went to bed and I know that if I did what she did and she noticed, then she would get mad at me...  Please help! I am confused. What would someone else do? Should I drop it?       p.s. I am sorry if this gets posted in the wrong category. If it does, please do not be rude and say that it is in the wrong place.Thanks!

Isnt saying you absolutely dont believe in God just as close minded as you claim we are?      3- Why do the Atheists on this site have such nasty attitudes and then claim that we're the ones with the problem?

20090306211556AAr0ybM	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Interacial Dating, Music determining race? The Idiots of the world controlling our actions with insults like "?	Wow after reading alot of stuff on interacial dating. I finally feel like I (being black and all) can date a white girl with out any problems. I am 17, most of my school is white. Personally I think it's easier to go to a primarily white school. Nothing against my race but lets be serious, I left my Flash Drive in the library and someone bought it to my class room...um I don't know if most people at my old school would have done that. Would I have done that? Back to the point, white I want to know is: If I ask this one white girl on a date (because I like her) how do I introduce her to my parents, and would meeting her parents be a bad idea when the time comes?      My mother does not care about the race of the person I date, well thats because I asked if she did. (My grandma told me that back in the early 90's my uncle bought home a white girl, my mother hated her. My uncle kept them away from each other...I wonder how that story ends...) But my father has no Idea I want to date a girl in my class who is white...he is from the south (near the border of NC and SC) and who knows what he would think. Should I ask him? If he turns out to hate her, should I give up, or ignore "his" problems. I mean they will lose control of me in less that 360 days...      Also, I hate the sterotyping (um spellcheck) of my race. I don't have the best grades (droped in 5th-10th because of influence from others before this school. Man it's peaceful here!) but I have never gotten into a fight. I don't curse often (trust me on that), I speak like a normal person, and I have goals in life that don't involve jail, or drugs.    This gets me to my next thing.      People (including her) were surprised when I bought my laptop to school and played Celine Dion, Nickback, Kell C...etc AFTER playing "LL". Why, does our race determine the music we can lisen to, people even say things like "your white"...um no I'm not, I'm black...   (She liked it, and even played songs, we sang the whole class, before and after getting in trouble)      Along with my other questions, what do yall think about the whole music thing? I never heard someone call a white guy black because he played TI. Do people say that?       Why can't we just do what we want without the idiots of the world comenting on it?

This is a bit of a confusing question but if you have any sort of input or real life examples anything would be helpful. Please no rude comments.      Anyways, basically, I have been going to Christian churches all my life. The last few years though my beliefs have been changing a lot. However, my Dad is still quite Christian oriented.    I have no problem with him having his beliefs and I respect them.   Recently though, I have thought about starting to go to a Unitarian church, just to branch out and meet more people and I'm curious to go to somewhere that there beliefs are more varied.    My mom has gone there and my dad has given her quite a hard time about it and there have been various "discussions" over it. She enjoys it though, and goes regularly.    Right now times are obviously stressful and I don't want to push my Dad too much, but I really would love to start meeting new people and getting back into a community atmosphere.    So do you think I should ask him? Just go? Or leave it be?      Thank you.   :)

Now I know what is meant to be will be. But I want us to last together forever. We love each other very much, I just think we need a little more help. I want him to know how much I love him and how much he means to be. I want our hearts to reconnect and be the strongest of the strong.          You need:      Two candles, one for you, one for the girlfriend.       Write your names on two pieces of paper which stand underneath the candle holder. On a third piece of paper, write both your names and draw a circle around them.       Place the candles about a foot apart on their respective pieces of paper, with the third piece of paper exactly in the center.                      Light your candle first and say:       Burn bright, burn true,    heart of (your name)      Then light the other and say:       Burn bright, burn true,    heart of (girlfriend's name)          If you have a wand, trace a figure of eight around the two candles, making sure to cross over exactly each time over the third piece of paper. If you don't, use the original inbuilt human wand - your index finger.      Say with each pass slowly:       A meeting of two hearts    if it is ordained    must come to pass.       Stop, take a deep breath in and out, and start on the second set. Three passes again, full fig eight around the candles.       Let no-one and nothing    stand in the way    of the meeting of two hearts.       Stop, take a deep breath and start the 3rd set of 3 passes.       Two hearts beat as one    it is my will    and it is done.       Now sit down and focus on the paper with the circle and both your names which is the power focus of this ritual.       See yourself and the gf together, being honest and true together, talking, making love, making decisions. Just you and her, keep that completely clear and powerful in your mind.       When you are ready, move both candles together and tip them so their flames combine. Take the circle paper and say:       My will is transferred    my spell has been heard    As I will, so mote it be.       Burn the circle paper in the single flame.       Blow out the single flame as one.       Wrap the candles and the name papers in tissue and dispose of them.

20090227115629AAcWXCh	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Looking for Muslim friends?	I am looking for muslim friends, both to learn more about the culture and religion as I am looking to convert, and because I want friends who share the same beleifs. Are there any good message boards/chat rooms/ etc that you could recommend?   I only have one muslim friend here in Canada personally and it is hard to meet muslims as I don't know if a man is muslim or not, I don't want to talk to a woman in case she does not mingle in genders and want to be respectful of the beleif that some people have in that. I also realize that religion is a sensitive subject. I just want to meet and talk to some people, particuarly  before I start going to Mosque

20090227092414AAyL2Eu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about this?	"Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.... Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by these who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion"       -St. Augustine of Hippo.

20090227105456AAmnGpq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question for Pagans (other religions may answer)?	Hello everyone! Before I ask my question...which is really more of an opinion question, I have to give you some background information:   Today in my sociology class, my teacher and I got onto the subject of religion, where my teacher says that there are only five real religions: "Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism and Islam." So I ask him, "Well what about Pagan religions?" and he answers that "Paganism nor any of its sects are religions but beliefs (I even pointed out Wicca which he said was not a real religion as well)." This upset to the point where I was shaking with anger and ready to start a rather loud argument with him...but I withheld my emotions (several students in the class who are well known activists in their religions were agreeing with him, I didn't want to have a large group oppose me)   What I would like to know is all of your thoughts on this (whether you are Pagan or not). I would like to know:   1. Your emotions about this   2. You thoughts on this subject   3. Your opinion   4. Your reasoning for your opinion   5. Evidence for or against Paganism as a religion.      *****Please do not just quote the bible, if you do, I will just ignore what you say, so why waste your time?*******      Thanks for your answers in advanced!

The house has a sizable thorny underbrush and creek bordering the backyard with a lot of suspiciously human garbage lying around in it. One day, while cleaning it out, I found a mud-filled bowl on one end of the property, just before the bushes. On the other side, there was a brown coconut, that was cracked from exposure to the elements. Now I've cleaned the bowl and I've left the coconut there but I can't shake off the feeling that there was something deliberate and ritualistic about their positions. What should I do?
