20081209001908AA7zk8d	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Lower the drinking age?	So I'm currently 18 and I do indeed drink...not a lot because I've learned my lesson and me and my friends never drink and drive but I hear a lot about people wanting to lower the drinking age for college students or plainly just down to 18.   I don't see what the problem is, most poeple that drink have already had a few drinks before they turned 21 otherwise they wouldn't be buying on the 21st birthday in the first place :P   I know poeple think it would be a distraction and such but I totally disagree....In high school I wasn't the best student but I graduated with a 3.0 overall (B+ average throughout the four years) and between 9th and the middle of 12th grade were the days I drank the most   I don't advise people to let their kids drink because I'm not proud of how I started drinking (i.e. my father's carlessness) but I seriously think it should be lowered

20070810055032AAdT2xu	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Was k?nnte man mitbringen?	Ich bin in einem Hundesportverein und wir haben 2 mal in der Woche Training (von 18.00Uhr- "open End" kann auch schon mal morgens werden).    Nun meine Frage:      Was k?nnte man zu Essen mitbringen?   Da es ja doch Recht lange ist und unsere M?nner immer über Hunger klagen und ich sie auch ein bisschen verw?hnen will. Schliesslich ist es ja ein Miteinander und wir haben viel Spa? zusammen.      Für Kuchen ist es schon ziemlich sp?t der f?llt raus, es dürfte nicht sooo gro?en Aufwand machen, ich müsste es schon zu Hause vorbereiten k?nnen und man muss es nebenbei essen k?nnen. (also kein richtiges Gericht wie Nudeln oder so).    Mir fallen da nur belegte Br?tchen ein aber doch nicht jeden Tag....       Bin für jede Hilfe dankbar         LG Peanutrory

20070705085744AA3W3Ta	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Would anyone have a recipe for a very simple fudge.?	The ingredients are simply store-bought icing and peanut butter or chocolate chips, depending on what flavor of fudge is wanted.  My mother saw it on Oprah quite some time ago, but she cannot recall the recipe. Would appreciate some answers, I am not good at any candy-making and this is a simple recipe.

20080926201759AA93kra	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	I'd like to start drinking tea....but the flavor...?	I hear that tea is really good for you. My mom makes some with the herbs she has but I only drink it when I'm sick because it's a type of medicine in my culture. (My parents came from a poor country and they depended on tea medicines...) Anyway, I'd like to actually LIKE tea but I don't like the taste. I like iced tea but it has to be sweet. I used to add like two tablespoons of honey to my cup of tea all the time. But how do I just LIKE the tea the way it is??
