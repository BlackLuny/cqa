20080308122442AA5d8Fk	Travel;Latin America;Venezuela	Venezolanos como Cambiar el Pasado???	Imaginate que se pudiera cambiar el pasado a nuestro antojo y debido a eso todo nos saldria bien pero a lo largo del camino no aprenderiamos nada, tampoco valorariamos nada.   Cambiar el pasado es algo que a todos nos gustaria. Será eso posible, poder cambiar nuestro pasado?, no realmente no se puede cambiar. Solo tenemos la oportunidad de aprovechar el presente para empezar un nuevo pasado evitando los mismos errores del ayer, del tiempo perdido que pasamos preocupandonos por algo que despues nos arrepentirnos de seguir, ya sea un amor imposible o un amor que no valió la pena.      Hoy, ma?ana será pasado, y tenemos una oportunidad más para cambiarlo.      Tambien atesorando solamente lo positivo que nos ocurrió en el pasado, será una forma más de liberarnos de la tristeza y frustración pasada.   El pasado no volverá pero el presente si, aprovecha las experiencias que te harán más fuerte emocionalmente, no huyas de tu pasado cambialo en este dia que despues se volverá ayer...      Besos...

My main problem is that I have looked all over the packaging for these bad boys and I can't for the life of me find out what their acceptable voltage range is.

Any help would be most appreciated! I'm a little concerned, and I can pick up a converter tomorrow if need be, but I'd rather not shell out the money so close to the date of departure.      Thanks :)

20090227165403AApHxyJ	Travel;United States;Honolulu	What's the truth about living and working in Oahu, Hawai'i?	I'm hoping to move to Oahu as soon as I can after mid-March. I've seen a lot of studio apartments on craigslist and apartments.com for under $700, and it didn't look like minimum wage jobs were that scarce, either. Most of this stuff is in Waikiki, which sounds like the best spot on Oahu if you don't want to be in the middle of Honolulu but still want to commute with relative ease.    But everything I've read says that you can't afford to live with just a minimum wage job. What's the deal? Working 40 hours a week at $7.75/hr I could make about $1,000 a month. $300 is plenty to live on. Am I missing something? Are these apartments all made-up? Is getting a job impossible even if you spend day and night searching and applying to every possible position and have a completely free schedule?   Please let me know if I'm being naive.

I have been piecing one together to make a very efficient survival backpack that I could probably stay alive with for months in the woods as long as the temperature stays relatively warm.       Example: I have orange duct tape wrapped around a few nails for space savers, nails for several possible uses, orange for several types of trail marking or aircraft signaling and the obvious endless uses for duct tape.

The smoker is polluting our air and the smoke travel to our nose and into our respiratory system and worst causing lung cancer. At least fart doesn't cause cancer

20090225104514AA1hPcI	Travel;United States;New York City	Greatest city on earth?	Im so scared, well, i was raised in this Middle of nowhere town in middle of nowhere america, Texas. Everything depended on your own personal Cars as transportation, it was like life support However My family controlled my life very much and I could not even drive until I left For Japan at age 17 for osaka And Tokyo. I am american, but those are the only 2 cities I ever knew and Experienced, I lived there until  I turned 22 and I felt the most free I have ever in my life . Im scared to death to dream of ever having to work and spend my life in the USA, as Ive grown to hate and detest it having lived my very controlled life over there and I probably dont know much about my own country, but what I do know and have experienced, I hate it with a fear. I want to go to spain to live but I dont think I will ever be able to, however now I am in texas, and eversince I came back from japan all fashionable and different from everybody here I COULD NEVER Ever take a breath of thought of having to live and stay here in texas( they are all so ugly to me) So my dad told me I will have to go to school in New York(becuz I want to study fashion) if I dont want to stay in texas, However like I told you , Im scared of any place within the USA and I have a dream to Go to Europe but I dont think that will be possible, SO Im stuck with the only option of going to New York... .   Could anyone tell me, is new york different? is new york great? is new york fun? are people fashionable there, are people open minded, are there many things to do, and most of all, do I need a CAR to get anywhere or can anything be done on foot and public transportation(I hate car dependency)?      THANKYOU and pleasee SAVEE ME!!  tell me its not so bad I am panicking (breathes heavily)
