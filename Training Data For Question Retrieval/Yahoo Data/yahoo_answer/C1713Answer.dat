AA11222206	To those who say having babies is a personal matter, I say, yes, as long as the ones who produced the offspring pay for the upbringing of the children themselves.  However, when the taxpayers have to pay then it becomes a public issue.  And the public does have the right to make their thoughts known just as the public has the right to voice their opinion on whether to move the street sign or not.  The taxpayer has a right to complain when their money is being used to subsidize irresponsible self-centered creatures who have no regard for the public or the children they're producing.|`|5frOVAgSaa	having children is a personal matter. leave them be.|`|TzL2NGUYaa	People kill me making a big deal about this situation.....what about the deadbeat *** baby daddies going around here lying and impregnating these dumb *** women.....they are seek welfare as well....we taxpayers just suck it up and get over it.....whats another 14 kids versus the 15 MM we paying for now.....|`|AA11403695	She is not in touch with the reality of this situation.

AA12068233	Let me make this as easy as I can for you.<br>  <br>  “Monkey” is a racial slur white racists have long directed at black people. It was pretty apparently the monkey or chimp in the cartoon in question was Obama, who happens to be black.<br>  <br>  I don’t know man, I don’t know now to make this any simpler. Am I making this clear or do I need to explain it further?|`|LWzrCu5caa	How many time have you heard Bush referred to as "The Chimp?"    I think this is a case of incredibly bad taste and nothing else.   <br>  <br>  If someone wanted to deliberately insult Obama,  they could have made a comment about "coon hunting."|`|MOF6Benoaa	Why is everything about race?  Before you jump on that issue, try reading a newspaper or doing some research.  Google the term "shot chimp in CT."  A famous chimp that has been on TV went crazy and attacked a family friend and a police officer.   The police officer had to shoot him.  It was all over the news.  It is only a controversial cartoon to those who don't follow current events, or you would have understood it.  But someone hears "shot monkey" and it's racist?|`|AA11915664	i guess the only one(s) who really know would be the person involved behind the generation of the cartoon. however probably has more to do the whole "chimp" issue than Obama. I thinks as a nation we have to not be jumping on every little thing and overanalyzing it for racism. we elected the man so let it go so he can do his job!|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	I don't. <br>  <br>  Please explain to me why you believe a monkey being shot in a cartoon is racial.|`|AA10527991	I do.|`|jB8BgxX6aa	It can easily come across as racial and it was in VERY bad taste. <br>  <br>  Dubya was portrayed as a monkey A LOT, so I also see how it's a reference to someone that's just stupid.<br>  <br>  But I still think the cartoon was inappropriate.

9rhmeb7raa	I don't get much of a tax cut. Works out to pocket change. Just like 91% of the current home mortgage holders in this country, my payments are up-to-date and I have about four years left on the note. I'm retired. So, unemployment compensation doesn't affect me. <br>  My stance is a simple one. This stimulus plan is pure Keynesian economics. Named for John Maynard Keynes. He's dead and his theories have been discredited. They didn't even work during the Great Depression. On the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, we still had 14% unemployment in the country.<br>  The way to stimulate an economy is tax cuts. Kennedy knew it. Reagan knew it. Even Bush the Younger knew it. But, that is not how the left wing of the Democratic Party sees it. One example. Until 1991, my retired military pay was not considered to be outside income when it came to the taxability of my Social Security check. Then they changed the tax code. Now, 85% of my Social Security check is taxable income. <br>  I know that those who view President Obama as some sort of Federal Wizard King have never read Article Two of the Constitution to find out what the job description of the President really is. Very few have ever looked into the background of Barrack Obama's childhood mentor in Hawaii. His name was Frank Marshall Davis. Use your search engine to look him up.|`|tguEmxVyaa	Like the Bush haters sent back their stimulus checks..What you think about Obama has nothing to do with the government helping the people..You don't understand people will still lose their homes and unemployment will stay high..|`|AA10192697	I've heard a few people say that they would send it back.  But will the media report on that?<br>  <br>  Govt sponsored job - yes because I don't trust the govt.<br>  <br>  Unemployed benefits - no because unemployment benefits have been available for decades and is a necessity. But shouldn't be abused. There are jobs out there. If flipping burgers or bagging food sin't your thing, then you shouldn't be allowed to get benefits for long.<br>  <br>  letting house go into forclosure - no one wants that to happen. A house is a great asset and a priviledge. But in order for that not to happen, people need to learn to budget and save.  Maybe mortgages should be garnished like child support.<br>  <br>  I am currently on SSDI. I became disabled in 2003. I have tried to work 4 times and worked 2 times for several months. But my health keeps getting worse. I don't like being on it but I need it to live. i am poor, live in a tiny apt for $500 a month and live on $70 a week. the rest goes to monthly bills.  I will not be able to work full time again but am looking for part time work again.  When people need it, they should have that benefits but not abuse it.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	1) lets see if there are tax cuts<br>  2)I don't have a government sponsored job<br>  3) I have a pension and am still working so no unemployment benefits<br>  4) My house is paid for since I didn't borrow more than we could afford. They used to call that responsibility.Same with the credit cards.<br>  5) To the best of my knowledge, I am not up for any breaks, money,or benefits and I pay for my own insurance. If they had a place to sign off on any money and let them keep it , I would.If they insist on sending me the money, I can give it to charity but not a political charity.<br>  6) You must really like peanuts and can eat a lot. Any money I got from Bush was in tax cuts and I could have bought an awful lot of peanuts with it. I didn't need it either and it went to charity. Not a political one.|`|AA12068233	Unlikely.

I filed "married filing separate" just so my husband would not be liable for the taxes I owed; but, the IRS not only took my $600, but also my husband's $600. I had even signed a contract a year before the "stimulus" to pay xxxx amount of dollars each month until my debt was paid!<br>  <br>  Timothy Geithner owed a lot more money than I did. I would like to know if the IRS took his "stimulus" money last year.<br>  <br>  My daughter is a CPA, I have taken accounting courses, and have worked in many accounting departments who have very <br>  "creative" accountants.<br>  <br>  I will do everything I can to get my share of Obama's<br>  stimulus" package, and I encourage everyone else to do the same--principles be damned!|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	hey we love Obama here in Canada!
guLruSbqaa	Their role is to report the news that is happening. I am not aware of any reporters that have gotten any movie roles or anything like that. I would think if they were involved in some sort of big event that a Celebrity would play the role of the person and not the person that it happened to. Then again I could be wrong this is the United States that we are talking about.|`|cec4a3f7c2ce5d3dfbd588b08c6c0697aa	Reporters are responsible for going out into the field and gathering information on a story.  Sometimes they get to choose their stories (aka they pitch them to news managers and get approval) and other times they are assigned to do one or more stories.  Once they have their story assignment they head to a location.  Sometimes a photographer accompanies them.  Other reporters are known as "one man bands" or "multimedia journalists" which means they shoot, write, and edit their stories entirely on their own.  Once they arrive at their location they are responsible for finding a character.  A character is someone that makes their story interesting.  It's the hook that gets you to watch.  They then interview that character and any other relevant people there.  Once they finish they typically head back to their station and write a package, the one to two minute breakdown of the event they're covering.  After it's approved by a manager they voice the story and either hand it off to an editor or cut it themselves.  Sometimes they front the story live either at a scene, location, or from the newsroom.  In other cases they do what's called a look live or as live where they prerecord a standup (the part where they stand up there and talk to you) and edit it into the story.  Sometimes they don't do a standup at all typically in situations where they didn't write the package they're simply providing the voice for it.<br>  <br>  Reporters often go live because news research shows viewers like watching live reports.  It has very little to do with reporters wanting to be actors.  While the reporters I've known certainly enjoy being in front of the camera it does come with drawbacks.  Some on air talent have what's called morality clauses written into their contracts stating what they can and cannot be seen doing outside of work.  Others have received threats or been harassed to the point where they have had to get law enforcement involved.<br>  <br>  News is supposed to be fair and balanced and in my experience reporters try very hard to present both sides of a story before airing it.  They not only have an ethical responsibility to do so but a legal one as irresponsible reporting can and does get television stations sued on a regular basis.  Reporting is a difficult and involved job and those that are not serious journalists quickly find it's not for them.|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	Reporters gather information about whoever and whatever the company they are working for asks. Some rerporters also get to analyze the information they gather and do a live report on tv. <br>  <br>  I would think that most reporters would like their "moment of fame", just as any actor.|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	the role of any good reporter is to give an unbiased account of an incident that is be important to their audience, unfortunately the news is a business just like any other and they depend on ratings to sell commercials so they can pay the reporters so until everyone stops watching all the sensational stuff and start watching and reading only the responsible stuff it won't go away

And they are all engaged in the great social sport of New York City called "kvetching" (griping, complaining). As a result, little progress has been made on construction at the site. Some of the steel from the old World Trade Center was used in the bow of the USS New York, a new American war ship. But, the corner of Church and Vesey Street in lower Manhattan is still marked by a large hole in the ground. |`|MnHfCOsDaa	there is one in hong kong and another one in taipei and lots of others. there are plans to build something new in new york and every architect has its own opinion and then money is the issue. and whoever had an office in the twins, is now probably working in some other skyscraper.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(disambiguation)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade...</a>|`|Gf2tzg5jaa	i think the World Trade buildings were more symbolic,  it was mostly leased out to private businesses and some apartments and a mall in the basement<br>  <br>  it wasn't owned by the government, which IMO is why it's taking a little while to be rebuilt.

We would be a much greener country, instead of being several years away from irreversible global warming damage. As far as his governance, im not sure how he would have done.

5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	One only has to have taken a passing interest in questions that have been raised on this site in the past few weeks, with relation to Israel's actions in Gaza, to understand that the labelling you mention is rife.<br>  Mention that Jewish supporters of the founding of a state of Israel were using terrorism in the region long before any Arab got around to that tactic, or that Israel, having been founded in 1947, has been effectively carrying out a programme of ethnic cleansing, or that Israeli politicians have, historically and continuously, been making statements of their belief that there should be no Arab people in the region unless totally subjugate to the Jewish people, and one is bombarded with off the wall statements about ineffective rocketry, accompanied by accusations of antisemitism.<br>  If war crimes have been committed by either side in the recent conflict, and it looks as though they may well have, then there is an internationally recognised mechanism for their investigation and for prosecutions to take place. That process should be allowed to happen, and if it is begun then Israel should co-operate with it.<br>  Israel, nor any other state, can place itself above the law.<br>  Israelis are the first to complain when others do - for example by failing to prosecute or extradite suspected WW2 criminals.<br>  I notice that the conference was a meeting of Major American Jewish Organisations.<br>  I suspect a propaganda festival.|`|8mQILFtVaa	No surprise.

ebD1plKNaa	1.  It is sometimes tiring.  Sometimes intimidating.  Sometimes scary.  Sometimes lonely.  Sometimes gratifying.  2.  Read a lot.  Talk to a lot of people in your area of interest, sports, politics, whatever.  Watch TV and video, and finally, write a lot.  3.  Some people do it in one thirty minute interview.  Others take a long time.  4.  English and/or Journalism.  But a few journalists have no formal training, they are just good at finding stories and putting them into words.

Israel is at the present violating many resolutions that tell it to allow Palestinian refugees (which Israel ethnically cleansed) to return to their country.  Israel also defies multiple resolutions telling it to withdraw from the Palestinian lands it occupied in 1967, and resolutions telling it to stop building and expanding illegal settlements in the West Bank.      There are many UN Security Council resolutions condemning and deploring Israeli attacks on its Arab neighbors, and many more from the UN General Assembly.  If it wasn't for the US using the veto power in the UN security council, there would have been an additional 32 resolutions condemning Israel.  That is not counting the countless potential resolutions that the US managed to stop before voting.  There is also international court orders telling Israel to remove the apartheid wall it built around and through the West Bank.    Israel is a rogue state that has absolutely no respect for the UN, international law or Geneva Conventions.  Yet Israel bases its legality as a state on the UN partition plan (which Israel also violated), and for being a member of the UN.    If it wasn't for the US always protecting Israel's aggression, most of Israel's leaders would now be tried in front of international tribunals for crimes against humanity.|`|rIm9yUNfaa	Israel  and it makes me feel that UN is totally ineffective, especially after massacre in gaza and other parts of palestine.

Iran is catching up pretty quickly, but as long as the Palestinians keep poking Israel with a stick, they will stay ahead.    I'm not sure which side you're on, but compare how many times Israel has been attacked under UN auspices vs. how many times Iran has been attacked.|`|Ij02BDygaa	Israel, Fact|`|zN1uPBAxaa	Who would'nt ignore the UN?

F8iYNurEaa	Because they are racist.|`|t79pLOCUaa	In the words of the song  'Everyone's a little bit racist'.    Almost any adjective used today could be taken as offence by someone. Many people just seek to be offended so they can make a fuss and claim victim-hood.|`|6YvkP2sGaa	Because people are either unaware or simply don't care about the feelings of others.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	@ Duchess: When black people use the N word amongst themselves its a political statement that stems from their ancestors treated as de-humanized slaves. It's a reaction to their history.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	They may not be "racist" per say, they may simply just not be very observant of their surroundings, or sensitive to others reactions, or interpretations.  In addition, their upbringing may have influenced their language, but may not neccessarily influence their beliefs.    For instance, if a child was raised to refer to a certain race by a slur, if they utter that slur towards, or in the presence of, that race, does that mean they are racist?    If they tell an off color joke, does that neccessarily mean they are racist?  Or are they just making fun of general stereotypes perpetrated by society on a whole?|`|bxlYleZkaa	Quite frankly We True Brits are the only ones who have ever been discriminated against and who have been the butt of "racist" remarks and jokes for hundreds of years. We have taken the blame for the demise of the American Indian and the Australian Aboriginal, most of the population of India and Pakistan not to mention the whole of Europe. No, I'm not a "racist" either, whatever one of those is. I'm just a True Brit.who is becoming just a teeny bit tired of being discriminated against in my own country. I am the one who should be "offended"|`|15bjtZhzaa	Simple answer...because they are people..  There is not one perfect person on our earth..  We all do or say the wrong thing, sometimes..

Racist people often start a sentence with "Listen, I'm no racist but....." and then go on to say something racist.

As there is no intention to offend I think it is up to the people who are more aware to educate them in a decent non threatening way,just tell them quietly and poltely that they have said something racist.If they did not mean to offend they will then learn from their mistake.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	I'm afraid you need to be more specific. While some words are overtly inflammatory and might belie a hidden racism, it's also true that some people will take offense if you say it gets dark at night.|`|i7oHTo9haa	I noticed extremist Muslims touting propaganda that Western white people are racist while the extremist Muslims claim they are not, but continue to want to wipe a whole race of people off the map.

It seems a bit like a trend really, where a particular word or phrase becomes the favourite un-P.C one until the next one comes along.    Frankly, I think we create more racism by being so obsessed with the whole subject.  It's divisive and breeds racial tension.  We need to stop overreacting to the bad use of some words and try helping people to find other ways of relating to each other.|`|e29dd74974bc25d59aabc8139b00731caa	yes i know what you mean. we are  called lazy brits. we are called white trash. its not good is it?|`|eZKmubDBaa	Are u saying that u r not racist?... do u really think that white people monopolise racism? I suggest that you get out more!|`|jImYZiDqaa	Good Evening Quirks    Using language that may offend people of a certain religion, gender, colour, age etc is not necessarily racist - just impolite or even bad mannered    Racism to my mind is forming opinions and making decisions about people based only on their colour or country of origin. Most countries have stereotype characters, some more derogatory than others. I think it's important to judge people on your own direct experience of them, not any preconceived image or second hand description|`|KDAAaRanaa	The key word in your question is 'MAY' - how on God's (with apologies to non-believers for the inconsiderate use of the G word) earth are we to live if we have to watch EVERY SINGLE WORD WE SAY for fear it MAY offend someone, somewhere?|`|ghljQhGIaa	which is more racist?calling someone a ni**er or calling someone white trash redneck? the answer is there is no difference they're all racist remarks it just depends on which side you want to take! all people are racist to an extent it's part of human nature! though it does not justify such remarks.|`|A1ARpuJbaa	Because they ARE racists pretending they're not and they think that EVERYONE is so stupid they won't be able to pick up on it.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	prejudice and favoritism should not be in a class with racism. because you like vanilla icecream instead of chocolate doesnt make you a racist.|`|fyhl3TQgaa	Are you asking about Carol Thatcher?|`|1f74df53253928939a96bcca2aa1e1b8aa	I take it this has something to do with the recent prince Harry and Carol Thatcher remarks made in private,I don't believe they or most of us are racist,have you never ever called anybody anything behind their back,I think each and every one of us have done so at some point in our lives|`|f5wTQblsaa	Why is there a 'Black Police Officers Association' but the not a 'White Police Officers Association'  Is that racist - apparently not

That would make one no better than the barbaric Arab clan wars or the drug cartels that battle amongst each other.  Try redircting that passion against injustice in a civilized way and enacting laws to combat whatever enabled the original crime to occur.  And please stop your use of racial epithets.

Allow the judicial system its due process    Reality: The accused will probably get acquitted by a lawyer claiming improper procedures or plea insanity.

It failed then and will fail this time.<br>  The only 100% proven way to get out of a recession is to give significant tax cuts.  It has worked 100% of the time. Even JFK did this and it worked.  Give the people their own money to spend instead of the government taking it from them and spending it the way they want.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	FDR was able to win reelection by promising to "keep the boys home."  He did not run on his economic "accomplishments."   Sadly,  the history books credit the new deal with bringing prosperity to the U.S.     Sad because the facts were different as reflected in unemployment rates through the 1930s above 15 percent and regularly in the 20 to 25 percent range.
