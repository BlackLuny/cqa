This is when I wonder how ppl can say that feminism isn't needed in the US or West when women are teaching other women how to submit to their husbands, as they think it is women's "godly" duty:   The Purpose-Driven Wife:  http://www.motherjones.com/media/2009/03...        Peace advocates the following of women, women should:   -be available anytime to satisfy a husband's desires (barring a few "ungodly" or "homosexual" acts),   -seek his approval regarding work, appearance, and leisure, and   -accept that he has the "burden" of final say in arguments.       What if you're not of their faith, or not of any faith, but these ppl want to change laws to reflect their repressive point of view onto all US women?  What do you think of teaching women to submit to their husbands for the "love of Christ"?

20090307223134AAJT8lX	Social Science;Psychology	I feel depressed and what can I do to be happy? how can i go on?	I know this is sooo long, but i wish others would understand....      I've been feeling like this for a few years. I'm still scared. I'm just a fat little nobody who doesn't have any friends, who don't even have a life, who struggled for so many years. and i've always wanted to end myself, but when i try to do something bad to myself i'm such a coward that i couldn't do it. of course, there's always this dream i had. this dream that i just hope that it'll come true. but, pff. whatever. i don't believe that it will happen someday. i'm so afraid of high school. and that's the reason why i'm extremely depressed now and it makes it so much worse, but it feels like i couldn't do anything. it feels like i'm never really happy. i couldn't even make myself happier. i couldn't even make myself laugh. no one could. i hate myself for so many reasons: i'm stupid, i'm ugly, i'm a nobody, no one even likes me, but who cares, i'm scared, i'm left out, i'm a freak and that's what others said behind my back and i could hear them say it, i'm wierd like what others say as well, i'm nothing. what can i do? how can i go on?

Best answer goes to the most correct answers (with valid reasoning). Thanks!          1. True of False: Some hormones can double as neurotransmitters            2. For some reason during Hannah's childhood, the ossicles of her middle ear began to fuse together. This will likely result in____.   a) immediate, irreversible hearing loss   b) no impairment in hearing at all   c) sensorineural hearing loss   d) conduction deafness   e) temporal lobe malfunction            3. True of False: Research supports the idea that repressed memories are merely reconstructed memories suggested by therapists; therefore they really do not exist.             4. T or F: Research suggests that the context in which an individual learns info aids in the memory of that information            5. T or F: Research by Garry and Loftus demonstrates that they were able to successfully implant false memories in a majority of their subjects.            6. T or F: Highly creative individuals are not necessarily artistic.

It can also empower men, but that usually involves being falsely accused of rape or losing custody of your children. Feminism is about embracing your woman hood, but sometimes it’s about rejecting that womanhood as a society imposed gender constraint. Feminism is about sisterhood, unless you disagree with some aspect of the ideology, then it is about lambasting these same sisters for daring to question it.

Wasn't there at least someone in the world who could have seen Hitler's intentions as reasonable and done for certain good results. We consider such generals bad, but if there were no wars, this would cause overpopulation and world hunger. So, can we simply see the world through neutral vision, with actions that have a purpose and those which don't?

20090227121444AA2Q6mE	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Does this dream mean anything?	Hi..   Please tell me if the following has any meaning at all..      I dreamt that a friend of mine was dressed as a chef and cooking something in a big kitchen.. (It felt like I was watching him on TV or something). While happily watching him, I had a weird feeling that someone wanted to hurt him.. Then I heard a noise that sounded like a gunshot.. I was praying that it's just the sound of the pot lid hitting the floor or something.. but then I saw him fall down.. and my heart dropped.. I could only see his face, I wanted to see the rest of his body to make sure that he was ok..but there was nothing I could do..I just prayed.. please let no blood come out of his mouth! let them make me take care of him..    Then I woke up scared and worried.. After a while, I slept again and had another dream that began with me wanting to tell him about the dream I had earlier..      That other dream is a bit long.. but if this one means nothing, then that must be the case witht the other one..   Thanks in advance..

I had a dream that I was layin on a bed with this guy (I don't know who he was, or represented) and we had sex. In my dream we worked together. He was assistant manager, and i was the leasing agent. he had a son and his son was sleeping in his crib which for some reason was partialy underneath his bed. after we had sex, I realized he bed had fallen. I saw that the crib was no were to be found. I lifted up the bed and there was the baby, smashed underneath. His face was blue, and his heart was buldging out of his chest. His face looked like he wanted to cry, but was almost dead and couldn't. I started yelling and crying and grabbed the baby and told the dad to call 911 as I tried to help the baby. Then, out of no where an old, crazy looking man grabbed the baby and my arm and at that time I was woken up by my boyfriend who said I was yelling and struggling...      The face on that baby and old man are seriously haunting me. Also, I'm also newly pregnant, and 19 years old. What could this dream mean?
