20090226130621AAwcYyd	Sports;Golf	What golf ball should i use?	I am an 18 year old golfer.  I have a handicap of 8 and like to play a slight draw on my shots.  I am not a long hitter like most of the players these days and rely on accuracy to get good scores.  I would prefer a soft ball for better control around the greens.  I play ProV1 when I am playing in tournaments in such, but when I am playing just a practice round, I don't want to use such an expensive ball.  I used to use Titleist   DT SoLo, but they stopped making them.  Do any of you know any balls that are comparable in quality and price?

20090226151020AATvpV1	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Best inexpensive peep sight to a 10/22?	I have a bone-stock (for now) Ruger 10/22 carbine and I'm just starting to tweak it a little.  I have ordered an auto-bolt-release kit for it, as well as an improved magazine release lever.      When I was a kid, we had a 77/22 with a peep sight.  I haven't used one in a while but I think it would be a good compromise between the (pretty decent in my opinion) groove-type sight that comes with it, and a full blown scope.  The reason I don't want a scope is simple:  there are no ranges in my area more than 100 yards and I can already do tight groups at 50 yards with just the iron sights...so a peep sight seems like it will get me consistent at 100 yards while still leaving some challenge in it.        Some seem to like the William WGRS-RU22 and it looks decent enough, especially for $40..but I figured I'd get a few Yahoo!'s to chime in (my mama told me not to listen to a bunch of yahoos, but did I listen to my mama?  Not even when I should have).

20090226104132AAS9v4T	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Fans of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man Utd. Which English opposition would you feel most comfortable with?	It looks like we could all be going through at the moment, which surely means that at least one quarter final fixture in the CL will be all English. Putting rivalry and bitterness aside for a minute to answer this question, which other English team would you feel most comfortable against?      As a Liverpool fan, I wouldn't be frightened of getting either Arsenal or Chelsea, but I would probably feel more comfortable playing Arsenal. In a one off two legged fixture, I think Liverpool could handle Arsenal's attacking threat, which hasn't really been great this season, and win the tie. (Ps. This isn't an invitation for Arsenal fans to scream "LIVERPOOL!!!")

Okay here is the offer:      Player #1 ships David Price and Camerin Maybin to #2      Player #2 sends Adam Wainwright and Torii Hunter to #1      Obviously player one has the guys with potential and player 2 has guys who have produced although not at an elite level. At this point we know Price is a lock to get a spot in the Rays rotation and Maybin will be given every chance to be the leadoff hitter for the Marlins.   Wainwright was basically the ace for the Cards, won 11 games with solid ERA & Whip but did see time on the DL. Hunter has been slotted as the #4 hitter for the Angels behind Vlad. So as a fantasy player which player would you think gets the better of the deal and please explain why you feel that way. I will award 10 points for the best good answer (the trade doesnt affect me and I have no bias one way or the other). Deal is a freinds and I have thoughts (not strong ones though either way) but want him to see what others might think.

20090226102844AASea2f	Sports;Running	Track Tryouts in 2 days unprepared!?	I have tryouts in 2 days and I'm not necessarily in shape, I have been running for about a week because I had a ankle injury a week before. I don't really know much about track, i know that the tryouts entail that I tryout for either distance or sprinting. I going for sprinting because at this point I'm not in shape to run a whole mile. I have a friend who has been on track and she says I should try out, so we went to the track together and she runs a 100 meter in about 13-15 secs. I'm about 3-4 secs behind her, and she says most people doing sprinting run about her speed or faster. Secondly, I'm a junior who has never run track before, and although there aren't cuts(I think), I'm not sure what to expect.   Basically what I want to ask is should I even tryout, I'm not exceptionally fast, nor am I particularly in shape. I don't want to embarrass myself, but I don't even know if I have a talent for it. Any suggestions? :(

20090226141731AAkjabH	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Man City the only team to field their best team win...shame on spurs and villa.?	Villa played in the intertota cup to get in here  and spurs may regret the chance of  european glory. what is the carling cup?! nothing`!!! teams try to get into europe anyway they can. city played well and hughes played a strong team. now with Ac milan and some of the other big names out they have a great chance of a trophy. truthfully spurs and villa fans would you not like a european trophy rather than getting murdered in the carling and winning a game against stioke. if villa lose a few games they may lose that fourth spot. and then what are they left with a uefa cup place. the game they just through away. i say good luck to man city and hope spurs get relegated and Everton or Arsenal get forth place and man city to get 6th. .

I always hear mma fans talking like mma is the closest thing to a real fight and I am positive it isn't. In mma there are rules to protect the contestants from serious harm so by training like that you lose awareness of moves like slaming people on their neck/head, hair pulling, tracheal grabs, strikes to the back of the head, headbutts and how to counter them while vale tudo on the other hand fighters have to learn to counter and use those moves in order for them to win, what do you think?

20090226145430AAmxi82	Sports;Wrestling	GPWF: Who will win these matches?	Welcome To GPWF, with last sundays show we now know all of the participants of the MITB, Marcus Cor Von is still not known to have a challenge, and Chairman Ba-Rock Obama is announcing a new oppertunity!      Event 1:   Chairman Ba-Rock Obama comes to the ring, he says he knows that most GPWF employee's are nervous about the company cutting most of its workers, so he (Obama) has decided to hold a six man X-division match for a million dollar contract.      Event 2:   Samoa Joe takes a seat for commentary.      Petey Williams vs Jerry "The King" Lawler      I choose the winner for storyline purposes:   Williams hits a huge DDT, then taunts at Joe - but Joe gets up from the table and points at Williams with a kendo stick, but Williams shouts back - allowing Lawler to get the roll-up!      Event 3:   RVD is in the ring with the entourage (Without The Boogeyman), he says he wants to fight Tazz in a match tonight one-on-one! Tazz appears on the Titantron:   (A) "Lets make this intresting in a boxing match! Tonight for the Main Event!!"   (B) "Ok smart-a** i'll be....." The Boogeyman gets behind him and hits the pumphandle slam thru a catering table!   (C) "You bet i'll be there....." The Boogeyman hits him on the head with his forearm, then tries to shove worms down his throat but Tazz low blows boogeyman and grinds boogeymans face into a Metal Fence then stares at the screen "This is a lesson to the entourage!!!!"         Event 4:   Jack Riot is in the GM's office, he (The GM) tells Jack that he will be in a match with Alex Dman's Brother: Joey Danna!!!!!      Non Titles Single Match with manager      Jack Riot vs Joey Dman with Alex Dman         Event 5:      Chairman Rumble      WWA Chairman vs EWE Chairman vs KWE Chairman vs TWE Chairman vs DWF Chairman vs GPWF Chairman         Event 6:   AJ Styles is on the Titantron, he says that tonight Tajiri will be going head on with the war machine!!!      Tajiri vs Rhyno         Event 7:   Bret Hart is in the ring, he talks about his fight with the undertaker at Pandemonium and how he will show Cor Von how its done!!!      Main Event:   Tazz comes to the ring for a match, but Boogeyman comes out from under the ring, like he was unhurt - then Tazz starts walking backwards, and behind him stands big show then from the crowd Jimmy Yang comes out with a crow bar and points it at Tazz and says "Howdy!" then RVD comes into the ring, and Tazz is surrounded so he tries to fight them off but he is beaten and dragged into the ring.   RVD then puts Tazz in the corner and hits the Van terminator, then RVD leaves the ring with Big show, while Boogeyman and Jimmy hit teir finishers multiple times on Tazz, Tazz is taken off on a stretcher. Tazz is unable to attend his match.      rate out of 0/10

20090226150932AAF7LFf	Sports;Cricket	Alastair Cook question?	Ok, one of Ian Bell's problems is that he has struggled to convert 50's into 100's and when he does it is usually when someone else has already got a century in the innings.      Yet at least he had scored some hundreds in the last year.      Alastair Cook has now gone something like 30 test innings without a century. During that time, he has made 12 fifties, in 10 of which he was dismissed between 50 and 75. He has passed 50 26 times in test now but only converted 7 into hundreds: itself not exactly an inspiring convertion rate of just over 1 in 4. And thats before you even take into consideration that he has scored all of them hundreds out of the first 14 times he passed 50.      Ian Bell's convertion rate at just under 1 in 3 is better than that.      Also, his persistance with the hook is costing him big time - as Boycott said on TMS - fantastic puller, but terrible hooker - his back foot doesn't move back and across as he plays it.      Do you agree his career seems to be going backwards? When he first entered the side at just 20 years old, I remember his maturity was praised. Yet does the last 12 months suggest the maturity expected of an established member of the side, who has played three years and had such a good start? (Especially as he is now vice captain)

20090226151826AAK2uK2	Sports;Other - Sports	I always choke in competitive sporting events, yet in practice I play amazing?	So, I've been trying out for the middle school tennis team, and not only do we have tryouts, but we have practices too since the tryouts are three and a half weeks long. Anyway, there are twenty-eight kids trying out for the team, and in practice I'm the best. My coach says I play at a varsity level. Then come tryouts, I lose my tryouts 3-0 (we play best out of 3 games) It really frustrates me, because I play at an elementary school level. I have won 1 game and lost about 9 or 10 in tryouts, yet in practice I've lost about 2 games and won more than 25. I always choke under pressure. What can I do? It pisses me off. Oh, and I have a really bad temper playing tennis. I cuss and shout, and I threw my racket really far today.

20090225113252AAPZsSf	Sports;Baseball	I have an 8 year old son and he is a very good baseball player, but his hitting is struggling any advice?	Like i said my son is 8 years old. He loves baseball. It amazes me how good his defense is (he pitches and plays shortstop) 32 games last season with six errors. The problem is  he struggles at the plate. He has a very good eye when it comes to balls and strikes he led the league in walks and had the fewest strikeouts.  He makes contact almost every time but he cant get the ball out of the infield.he hits allover the infield but most of the time they are lazy ground balls or weak pop ups.  At least three times a week he hits about 100 balls off of the tee and then i pitch about 50 or 60 balls to him. He has a tryout coming up next week and he is so worried that he is not going to make the team. Any advice? buy the way I don't push baseball on him. its his idea to practice as much as he does.

Why would there be a 380cc DyMo, but not in retail?  I know Stewart Cink plays/played a Sumo squared Tour version, and I never saw that in stores, either.      I was just getting into golf when the whole stink over Tiger's golf ball being in stores was breaking out.  I thought Nike had to actually put that ball into stores, since they were saying they were.  Wouldn't that mean they'd have to have the Tour SuMo squared, the 380 cc DyMo and the Callaway FT-9 (with the long hosel- for Phil Mickelson) in stores, as well?
