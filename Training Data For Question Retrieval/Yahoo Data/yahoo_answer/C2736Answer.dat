kNYDHZqAaa	You definitely have the space to have a cat OR a dog, and it sounds like you have the time for either, as well. There are a lot of dogs that don't need much room at all, just consider what breeds would work best for your situation and don't get one impulsively. My sister lives in a one bedroom apartment with her little yorkie, and she is happy as a clam, so a six room house would provide plenty of space for a variety of dog breeds.<br>  <br>  Dogs do require a lot more attention and training in order for them to be happy and well-behaved, so that's something you should consider if you want to get a dog - do you have the time, patience, and possibly money for training/obedience classes? Do you have the time or desire to walk dogs if necessary?<br>  <br>  Cats are definitely more low maintenance, and wonderful pets - but if you love dogs and are going to expect the cat to act like a dog, then you will just be frustrated. Cats are very independent, and often affectionate, but just very different than dogs. <br>  <br>  Also, after you've put some thought into it, please check out your local shelter! A lot of people think that shelter animals aren't as "good," but you can find a lot of really amazing animals there that really need a good home. I've gotten my cats from shelters, and volunteer at shelters - every time I go to volunteer, I'm sad that I can't scoop a bunch of them up and take them home with me!|`|K4rP4A0naa	Being a dog lover i say go for the dog!<br>  <br>  You don't need a lot of space for a toy breed. I'd recommend anything from a Chihuahua to Maltese, Shih Tzu, that kind of thing. You can get maltese cross breeds a lot cheaper than pure breds and they are great. I have a Maltese x Silky Terrier and she's the most gorgeous, fun and playful dog. <br>  <br>  The only issue will be toilet training but that's not difficult and you'd probably have to deal with filthy litter boxes if you got a cat.|`|UpU5eep9aa	You sound a kind person and your children sound very well brought up but the thing is cats and dogs are different species so if you really want a dog then you are doing a cat a disservice by having it as second choice.<br>  Having said that I would think a cat would be a lovely pet for your family if it was wanted as a cat and not a substitute dog.<br>  <br>  Leaving him/her alone for only about three hours at a time is perfect, but when you go away for 4 days you need to either put him/her in a cattery or ask a trusted friend or neighbour to pop in at least daily to give the cat fresh food and water and make sure he/she is not ill or trapped somewhere dangerous<br>  <br>  Can I just say again how lovely it is to read that your children are careful with animals, the credit for that is entirely yours, well done!|`|X6PDtlq4aa	Sounds like a dog will fit your lifestyle if you're only gone a very short amount of time every year! I'm a cat person, because a dog for me is way too high maintenance. Cats can be left alone for up to a week (with proper food and a running water fountain) without needing humans for anything except for companionship! <br>  If you're going to get a cat I would recommend a male cat over a female. Based on my experience with cats, males are more loving, playful and wanting of attention than females, who tend to rather be left alone and have their own agenda that doesn't include you. It's best to get a kitten so that your family can grow with it and it can acclimate to your family naturally. I've had my cat for 10 years since he was a baby and I've never had a stronger bond with an animal before.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nXgc461baa	I have one of each. My cat is a really good cat. He loves people and to cuddle and it is no work to take care of him, besides cleaning his litter box and feeding him. We can also leave for a couple days and he is fine as long as he is fed. He also is not in the way when we have company over. I love my cat to death. <br>  <br>  My black lab is a good dog (he is still very young) although a ton of work! We don't have a huge yard so he has to be walked twice a day.  He is also in dog classes, these classes give you homework to practice with your dog everyday. He takes up a lot of our time but is totally worth it. Dogs also show you a sense of appreciation, they greet you at the door and you know they miss you when you're not there. Cats don't really care lol. If you really like taking care of your pet and have enough free time, I'd go with a dog. Both are great though!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes a cat will fit your life style and so would a dog|`|DN6XtoViaa	yes, very much so. <br>  cats are fun and can actualy take very good care of themselves, so all they really need is some food and some lovin every now and then.<br>  <br>  dogs on the other hand require a lot more attention. cats are a much less hassle. <br>  <br>  but really you should get what you know and love, and really want. <br>  sounds like you have plenty of space for a dog if that is what you really want!|`|zeTGmB3faa	You really are a good candidate for a pet as you already have concerns about a pet's well being. If you have a nice fenced and secure yard, there is no reason that you can't have a dog. It sounds like your pets will get a lot of attention and be treated like family members. A cat would also be a wonderful addition. <br>  With either or both, please adopt from an animal shelter and save the life or a pet. Take them to the vet for a check up and you will find that your family has added a wonderful addition. Best wishes.|`|rLzfhCJxaa	It sounds like a dog or cat would suit your lifestyle very well!<br>  You have enough space for a dog, and definitely enough space for a cat, and someone is nearly always at home.<br>  <br>  However, you also have to make sure that you have lots of available time to give to play with a cat or walk a dog, as well as train it. <br>  <br>  All dogs need at least one walk a day, with larger or more active breeds needing a lot more. If you don't have a yard, you can eaisly handle a smaller breed of dog, but if you want a bigger one, be prepared to walk a lot.<br>  Training occupies a lot of time, and they are a LOT like babies and are very demanding.<br>  <br>  I think a good idea is to check out dog breeds on this site, and find out what best suits your living arangements and daily activity levels: <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/</a><br>  (they have a quiz you can use to find a dog that suits your lifestyle).<br>  <br>  Cats, on the other hand, are more independent.<br>  <br>  Overall, both would. One thing I must say however is, is this:<br>  Don't buy while shelter pets die.<br>  <br>  And of course, make sure you feed the most nutritious foods; Iams, Eukanuba, Purina, Science Diet, Kibbles'n'Bits and the like are some of the worst foods available. They are getting sued for including euthanized pet anmals and roadkill in their foods, among other things, and you can read the court file  here: <a href="http://www.mflegal.com/petfoodlawsuit" rel="nofollow">http://www.mflegal.com/petfoodlawsuit</a><br>  As a rule of thumb, if you have ever seen an advertisement for it, don't buy it- they spend more money on ads than on ingredients.<br>  Make sure the foods you choose have no grains, by-products, or unnamed meats.<br>  <br>  Good nutrition sites for dogs:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good nutrition sites for cats:<br>  <a href="http://www.catnutrition.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catnutrition.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org</a>|`|inST4SlAaa	either one would fit.  i personally  love cats because they are more independent.  when we go away for the weekends we leave lots of food and water.  you only go away four days a year so i wouldnt worry.  we go away more often so we have three cats and they keep each other company|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Sounds like it, as long as you don't mind getting cat hair on your furniture or barf on your carpet.  Cats are pretty independent, but they can be high maintenance.<br>  <br>  Dogs usually spend the time when they are alone barking and annoying the neighbors.
3sB49YNnaa	There are some things you can do.  First, put her on a 14% protein guinea pig chow, give her lots of grass (not alfalfa or clover) hay and see to it that she has plenty of water. You may need to limit her pellets to a couple of ounces a day.<br>  <br>  Dieting is about reducing calories but not the quality of nutrients.  If you are giving her anything fatty like seeds or nuts, stop feeding them.  Don't change her greens amount.<br>  <br>  She could also do with more exercise.  If she isn't excited about moving about you need to motivate her to get some exercise.  Food motivates pigs so one trick is to put her food on one side of a big cage and water on the other.  That way, she has to at least walk back and forth. You can also put a 2x4 between the food and water so she has to hop over it on her way back and forth.  Be sure that she can get over it in her unfit state, if not, take it out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  You are doing the right thing.  Just like with people, in pigs plumpness in moderation isn't bad but downright fat is unhealthy.|`|YFTZM86maa	Consult a vet, often animal hospitals will give some advise over the phone to try before bringing the pet in.  In the mean time....<br>  Cut way down on fruit, it's not as good as greens any way.  Cut down on fatty foods.  No nuts. No alfalfa, only timothy, and have timothy hay all the time.  Since they combine eating with drinking, place water and food at different ends of the cage so she has to move.  I dare guess that the cage is too small.  My pig started scooting instead of walking when he had to be in a small cage for a while.  Have hay and veggies in a hay rack where she has to stand and stretch to get it.  Take her out of  the cage more.  Put her on the floor to see if she'll move around.  Try putting her in an empty bath tub.  Sometimes the different place and different sensations of the flooring will make them investigate.  Sounds like you cut back on pellets and replaced with more green veg, I read that is fine as long as you make sure all nutritional requirements are met.  If you have a food mix with a  lot of other things in it, then that may be contributing to weight as well.  Other grains and dried fruits and nuts that are often mixed in to some food are high calorie and high fat.  You should gradually change out food over 2-3 weeks if you change food types.<br>  Do a thorough body check and feel for tumors or anything strange.  Try the new routine for 1-2 weeks.  If no progress in getting her moving more, then make an appointment with an exotics animal vet.<br>  <br>  A couple sites below that I found helpful.|`|wsLngQ8oaa	If you only have one that may be part of the problem, she has no one to play with! I would get a second pig, obviously a girl so you don't get a bunch of little piggies. Luckly for you introducing a new female to another female is far easier than dealing with boys in that instance they tend to get rough. It would be great to give Ginger a playmate for sure I'd try that but also be warned that there is a proper way to introduce them. I added a link for you to check out to make sure the transition is a painless one. Good luck and give my love to Ginger :)|`|oNHtVHzsaa	i would try to feed her more lettuce and more timothy hay. the lettuce is healthy and the timothy hay helps w/ digestion. also, when its warm out put her outside in the grass and let her run around and eat grass. this is good for them and motivates them to want to exercise. good luck to you and ginger and hope this helped.|`|VAjIdq4oaa	go to the Veterinarian, when my cat turned into a walking skeleton i took him straight to the them, and they figured out the problem and within time he gained weight, so go to them..<br>  Much Luck...|`|ffc39a952453bb382cf4c6fd2af384eeaa	I would take the piggie to the vet to have her checked out.  Her weight gain could be a situation that needs medical attention, and not just a change in her diet.
GdBG4PGYaa	To follow up on Suzy Cutes answer, they (went?) or are going to court.<br>  <br>  Somebody called saying "I would like to report animal abuse. (Lady) Okay, was this seen on... youtube..? (Man) Yes......"<br>  <br>  So, eventually the man got around to saying that he had called Sandra and she said she "took away their mountain bikes. For awhile."<br>  <br>  I mean, WHAT! That kid should go to juvenile detention for beating that poor animal. Dusty's face was the sadest thing I've ever seen.<br>  <br>  So, that was their punishment, and I think at the very least they should have been grounded from TV, Computer, Electronics in general, They shouldn't be allowed to TOUCH animals for the rest of their lives, no friends over, and they shouldn't be allowed to eat either breakfast or lunch. He beat Dusty twice, Patches once, and probably a lot more times than we know (that weren't on tape.) If you see the first video of them putting water up Dusty's nose, he was already terrified of them, in a corner.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and I wish the worst for Kenny and Weston Glenn.|`|oT71QN8Raa	It doesn't seem like anything there are any updates online.  He and his brother are minors, so I am sure that's why things are being kept hush hush when it comes to the actual trial.  It also takes time sometimes to put a case together, despite how obvious and clear everything is.  This is most likely the annoying waiting period.  I will definitely continue following the story...I personally think that they should have done to them what they did to Dusty.  But that's just me<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Are you freaking kidding, Suzy?  TRAIL BIKES??  Taken away for a while?  Wow.  Those boys must be so upset.  I mean gosh, to have your trail bike taken away just because you beat the crap out of a defenseless screaming animal.  Harsh. <br>  <br>  People make me mad.|`|UpU5eep9aa	My God, I didn't know anything about that, they must be monsters of pure evil.  I would publicly disown them if I was their parents, after beating them to a pulp and showing them the door for good. I only hope they haven't learned this behaviour INSIDE the family home.<br>  <br>  I despair of humanity and am scared to think what the world will be like in the near future, I'm glad that I'll not be here that long!|`|BpXbNjEpaa	I know when they were initially tracked down from the internet his mother said she would "deal with it," but nothing since.|`|w1lh1INHaa	The last I saw, Sandy Glenn said the boys' trail bikes were going to be taken away "for a while" as punishment.<br>  <br>  Other than that, their lawyer as told them to keep mum about the whole ordeal.
ffc39a952453bb382cf4c6fd2af384eeaa	I can't even imagine what would prompt you to ask such a question.  I don't think that anyone who loves animals can be put into the category of self centered and selfish.  Giving your love, whether it be to a person or an animal is a very selfLESS act, generous and giving, so quite the opposite.  Some of the questions I see on here AMAZE me.  Use your gift of free time and thought for thinking that is WAY more productive and useful.|`|UyKMwdrAaa	No i don't think so.  Anyone who is capable of loving an animal with all their heart whether it be a dog, horse, cat, cow whatever has got to be a kind and caring person with the ability to let their heart out and give.  People who do that are not self centered and selfish.  We make ourselves that way but certainly not from being a dog lover.  So love your dog as it is so rewarding.  They say people who have pets and love them to pieces live longer and are less stressed in life.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	how would owning a dog make people self centered that don't make scene.its like a person loving another person that don't make them self centered. self centered would mean they care for no one or nothing but themselves and people that own pets have to care for the pets so think about it|`|7gyvOQMWaa	No they just love animals. There is nothing wrong with it.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i think kelli l is.|`|KuUx34hCaa	some are|`|bIaywrBCaa	I know some who are but by no means does that pertain to dog lovers in general.|`|W0buucLsaa	No... the selfish ones are people who get puppies because they're lil' and cute and then ignore them or abandon them when they're adults.<br>  <br>  In short, puppy lovers are selfish. Dog lovers aren't.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	I believe "dog people" are quite like "family people".  Dogs need endless time and care, like relationships, families, and people.  Dogs are sociable, they love meeting other dogs and people, when raised appropriately, like people.  Dogs are full of personality, like people, which creates a bond with people-- as would a person to person relationship.<br>  <br>  I could go on...<br>  <br>  People who love dogs strive to save and rescue them along with other domesticated animals, etc. which is not selfish at all.<br>  <br>  There are "bad dog breeders" who like to pose as "dog lovers", in that case, they are self centered and selfish.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Any true *ANIMAL LOVER* probably isn't selfish at all-- It takes sacrafise,  love, time, devotion, to care for animals!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Some are - but they are the ones that aren't true dog lovers. The ones that breed for looks and to win shows, the ones that keep their dogs locked up all day, the ones that think they can teach their dogs by being violent towards them...|`|yCR6qg0baa	What an over-generalization...... "All" dog-lovers can't all be the same. Maybe you know one person like that, but it's just one person. If someone loves their pets, they're obviously not self-centered. Why would you even ask a question like that?|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	NO!! I think true dog lovers are the BEST people in the world. I wish we had more of them.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Actually I think that people who don't own dogs are self centered and selfish people.  I used to be one I had no compasion for other people's dogs, even though I dog sat, walked and volunteered at animal shelters.  It wasn't until I got my own dog that I found that dog people are great people to know.  They love their animals, they care about their welfare, i see some dogs treated better than children.  I probably care more for my dog than I do some people, not all people but some.  Dogs teach you the meaning of unconditional love.<br>  <br>  So no I don't think they are self centered I think people who don't own dogs need to be more understanding.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Quite the opposite.  It takes a lot of sacrifice (time, money, effort) and a lot of compassion to care for a dog...or any other living creature for that matter.<br>  <br>  I think people who breed strictly for money with no care about the animals involved or the people they are ripping off are some of the most self centered and selfish people walking the face of this Earth.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	No, I think they're just the opposite.<br>  I know hundreds of dog owners.<br>  <br>  After awhile, I can pick out those just going through the motions of owning a dog and those who really care about their pet even though they're all out giving all of them exercise.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I don't think blanket statements work anywhere.  <br>  <br>  Dogs lovers are like everyone else.  Some are great, caring and giving people some are selfish, self absorbed ninnies.  Loving dogs doesn't have anything to do with it.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	Actually I think non dog lovers are self centered selfish people.  How could any one not love one of dogs creatures.<br>  <br>  PS  Actually I think I like my cat and dog better than some people.<br>  But of course I think you expected such responses by asking your question in this section.|`|kRO55DHyaa	On the contrary, "dog people" tend to be more giving, sympathetic, and caring about both people and pets.|`|b5ecvoTnaa	er... where did you get that from? Of course I don't. Dog lovers just... love dogs.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	NO!  My dog friends are my best friends.
Rw7gi86Naa	A kitten should stay with its mother for an absolute minimum of eight weeks and preferably 12 weeks. Although they may be "weaned" prior to eight weeks, they will still have the occasional need to nurse. Kittens taken from their mom cats before this time often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood.<br>  They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats.<br>  The time they spend with their mother and siblings is very important. Think about how you would have turned out if you were taken away from your parents too soon, and didn’t have the proper role model to learn from. Often kittens that are separated from their mother too soon, will be very shy, and have social problems with other animals as well as humans.|`|10eguzBCaa	he will be fine just let him have the run of the house stop worrying|`|rLzfhCJxaa	Block up places that he can get stuck in- you can also rub orange peels against places you don't want him to go, as cats usually hate the smell of citric acid.<br>  <br>  A simple little shoebox (for now) or cardboard box lined with a comfy towel or blanket are good enough beds. But let him crawl into yours if he wants to!<br>  <br>  Another pice of advice is to learn about cat nutrition and use common sense and logic; cats are carnivores, so feed a diet that is appropriate to that. A good diet can let you escape lots of disease and general issues. No grains (corn, wheat, oatmeal, barley, maize, etc), no 'by-products' (aka heads, feet, organs, intestines, etc) and every meat has to have a name- it cannot just be called 'meat' or 'meat meal' or anything like that.<br>  I really, REALLY suggets you read these two sites so that you can give your kitty the best food possible:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catnutrition.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catnutrition.org</a><br>  <br>  And also, if you are going to get the kitten in a week when it will be 5 weeks old, can you wait a bit longer? <br>  Kittens should stay with their mothers until at least 8 weeks so they can be properly socialized.. Cats taken from their mothers at younger ages than that often have behavioural problems like biting and whatnot, and may not have learned to use the litter box.<br>  If the cat is already separated from its mother due to circumstances (abandoned and placed in a shelter/foster home, mom died, etc) then thats understandable. But if the mom-cat belongs to someone  you know, please ask if they can keep it a bit longer. I know you're excited and all, but its much better for the kitten to stay with its mother.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	He'll be 5 weeks? That's too young for you to be taking a kitten away from its mother. It has some much more to learn, probably a good 3 weeks more to learn! Anyway, Just introduce him to everything by putting him down when you first get him. He might hide if he's a shy cat, by eventually hunger will get the better of him and he will come out. Just let him adjust on his own schedule, not yours!!! =), hope I helped.|`|69IbmEtaaa	Awhhh congrats !!<br>  When i first got my kitten he loved a carboard box with lots of blankets try that in the corner of your bedroom, make sure you shut your bedroom door when your in it so he cant venture to far without supervision lol. Hold him alot and cuddle him and let him sleep on your bed with you if he wants if not put him in his cardboard bow lo. thats what i did :P haha goodluck!!|`|WqGxGJkbaa	There is NO WAY ON EARTH that you should have a 5 week old kitten.  This is totally irresponsible and the person giving it to you at that age should know better.  No kitten should leave its mother until it is at least 8 or 9 weeks old.  You will end up with a kitten with learning difficulties as it still needs its mother and litter mates at that age.  That is the reason why the mother cat continues to look after her kittens until they are about 8 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Please think again about this and dont bring the kitten home for a few more weeks.|`|AA10973140	I have to agree with jue...the kitten needs to stay with momma cat til it's 8 weeks old ( if possible.)  I hated waiting til mine was that old, too.  But I knew it was necessary, for the kitten's well-being.  In the mean time, go see the kitten when you can.  After you get it you should let it look out the window often & play with it with a toy fishing pole...they love it !  (They get bored easily.)|`|QvFcqgnPaa	I always let my kitten sleep with me keep it under the cover or on the over side of you or ever put pillows on the ground or put something to block him falling off|`|fQRunQphaa	he will likely develop favorite sleeping spots - my cats rotate their favorite spots.  as a baby - they are easy to please.  a box is easily favored over fancier beds - just a blanket or a towel for them inside a box will make them happy.  <br>  <br>  i would put a few boxes (even shoe boxes are great) around your home, including bedroom.  and the cat bed you bought, they're never too young for that.  try to cat-proof the place if you can - shutting closet doors, cabinets, and maybe block off so he can't wander under the bed - although lots of cats like to sleep under the bed.  they do come out :)  <br>  <br>  if you are ok with him on your bed, invite him up there.  if it's too high for him to jump, a box is good.  he will let you know where he like to be.  he is SO young that he might sleep on you (mine slept on my neck/throat for awhile, or on my chest) for warmth and comfort.  might be best to feed him kitten formula (from any pet store) until he is around 8 weeks old and then kitten wet or dry food.  <br>  <br>  have fun and take good care of the little guy :)
D1beU6MPaa	Your Answer:<br>  If your dog is a male, you need to get a female. Keep in mind that older dogs sometimes have a hard time dealing with young puppies who are always wanting to play. The breed really does not have a lot to do with it. It is a matter of tolerance. You may want to introduce them slowly, and not leave the puppy alone with your older dog. Funny how puppies always think any dog would love to be their playmate. Just use caution, and common sense. Good luck<br>  Source(s):<br>  Lifelong dog owner and breeder<br>  Horse owner and breeder|`|vXFpzKRaaa	I think it up to the individual dog.  It's hard to say a certain breed won't get along with another breed because every single dog is different.  Most people would agree that dogs and cats don't get along but there are many cases where they do live fine together.  My point is, there are set rules as to what will get along with what.  The only advice I can give you is to give it a try.  Maybe talk your dog walking so he'll meet different dogs specifically a Yorkshire terrier.  Maybe arrange a get together with a Yorkshire some how.  And even with doing this, you may have to have your border collie meet the specific Yorkshire you're thinking about getting.  This would be the best way to know for sure.|`|IyGliGWvaa	Breeds have nothing to do with getting along with each other or not. Usually dog breeds with similar sizes get along well, but it all depends on stuff like behaviour, for example.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is: find someone who has a yorkie. Ask him/her if it's okay to bring the dog to your house. Let the yorkie socialize with your collie for a while. If everything goes perfect, and your collie behaves well, than it's okay. If there's some stress, then it's probably a bad idea.
bMuwuAVOaa	I believe the little pest is spelled gnats.That being said it is hard to get rid of these tiny bugs as they are to small to respond to most sprays. Here is what I have used in the past with such a problem. Burn a strong incense such as sage or sandalwood. Put several around the house then recite this incantation....<br>  Mary God's mother traversed the land<br>  Holding 3 gnats in her hand<br>  One was black <br>  One was white<br>  The third was red<br>  And now they're dead<br>  Dead<br>  Dead<br>  Dead<br>  Make sure the smoke goes into every room and say this chant in every room as well. Remember the law of three so make your chants in each room 3 times each. This has worked great for me in the past and I am sure it will work for you as well. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|BWez86Ldaa	Lol some funny answers there. Anyway, I use as much sent-spray as I can then I run around killing them like I'm crazy, which makes good fun especially when you're husband gets home from work while you're doing this, talk about looking crazy! lol Honestly, the bug zapper things work well outside. Inside, keep it as clean as possible (I'm not saying that you're dirty! lol). Disinfect everything and use scent sprays, it seemed to help in our house.|`|BbWk7RNgaa	I think you mean gnats.  Little tiny flying bugs?  Try one of those hanging fly strips.  They're ugly but effective.

Zbn8A7Geaa	Yes they get used to people and yes she knows you.  The answer above stated it very well.  The hamster knows your smell, definitely.   But she's smelling your hand for two reasons: to see who you are and to see if you have any treats.    If you want her to go to other people, bribe her. It works wonders.  Have the person hold a treat in their hand, you hand them the hamster -- once she smells the treat, she won't mind being held by someone else.  Bribing is great for getting hamsters to be friendly.  Try to always have the person sitting down when they hold the hamster, so if the hamster does get scared or startled, it won't drop or be hurt if it tries to escape.|`|0arBtMruaa	Hamsters are like any other pets. They get familiar with their owner. YOur hamster does know who you are and the fact that it only goes to you means that it trusts you because you are the one that takes care of it. Your the one that feeds it and cleans the cage so they know your smell so they will b familiar with you the most.|`|WjNgfHP0aa	I bought my hamster a year ago, and she was exactly like that.  After she got used to me, I wanted her to get used to other people, too.  So when people who wanted to hold her came over, I took her out and let her sniff them and then I let them hold her, but stood by them so she would know it was ok.  Hamsters do know who their owners are and can be very affectionate and loving, just like dogs.Hamsters also depend alot an their sense of smell, that's why she smell your hand is becouse she can't see your whole body and needs to know it's you.|`|7gyvOQMWaa	i have had 2 hamsters. they will start of sh and ten open up just give them time.

No, of COURSE you didn't research this first.<br>  <br>  Reputable breeders NEVER crossbreed cats.

If she did indeed allow him to mount and mate her, since cats are induced ovulaters (meaning they don't ovulate unless mated), it is pretty much guaranteed that she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  I recommend researching feline pregnancy and dealing kittens, since if they mated, it is very likely that you're going to have some and clearly you don't know much about cat breeding yet you chose to breed your cat. <br>  <br>  Find homes for the kittens before they are born and get your cat spayed as soon as they are weaned.|`|543a7a859bf324f6c01cc1055da43447aa	Well since your cat mated with the stud, you want to make              sure she's pregnant, her nipples should be pink three weeks             after she has mated.

WHY are you breeding her?  Do you think you'll be get ANYTHING out of those kittens?  They'll be MUTTS and worth nothing...NOTHING!!  There's no point in breeding her.  Unless you LIKE adding more cats to the world. I am typically very understanding about people realizing their cat got pregnant.  I get irritated when other people yell at them.  But THIS type of thing...the purposeful breeding of MUTTS for no reason just...gosh.  GRRRR to you sir!|`|1wHuhyPFaa	Curious. Good job- more kittens to be put to sleep!

I just clean it all out and give them fresh stuff once in the morning when I get up (and if I'm late I hear it) and when I get home from work.

It is also higher in fiber<br>  <br>  <br>  ? cup per day of pellets (no added dried anything!) for adult guinea pigs. Unlimited pellets for guinea pigs younger than 6 months "<br>  <br>  Pigs are nocturnal by nature.  They can adjust to our schedule, but still need food all of the time, their metabolism is high and different from ours.<br>  He needs food all the time, they graze. They need food, hay and fresh veg.  Get some hay, he needs it all the time. Grow some wheat grass, it's pretty cheap, or pick grass from outside if it's not treated with chemicals. Parsley is cheap, less than a dollar's worth will last you several days. Look for deals, sometimes you can get a large bag of dark greens like spinach for a dollar. Hay at pet stores is VERY expensive, so find where you can buy a bale from a farmer, usually less than 5 dollars, and store in a large plastic container to keep it dry.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Absolutely! There should be food in the cage at all times so that the guinea pig can eat whenever it wants to.  Guinea pigs, like hamsters, rabbits, and such, do not have a set schedule like dogs and cats -- the food should be available to them at all times.

OI find males are nicer, but only after the operation, and if u get two make sure they're not both males for they kill each other and make sure if one is a girl that the male is neutered or you will have lots of little bnunnies before the month is over.<br>  A fish is also good if you're not very responsible.<br>  But i dont suggest mice or hamsters or guinea pigs because they are cannibals and eat WAY too much.....|`|XTGGNRHIaa	Dog--if your not allergic to them too.<br>  Rabbit<br>  Birds are always fun...especially if you get one that you can teach to talk! = )|`|NehnjjQtaa	by all means i would have to say a cute adoarble puppy 100%!!! there so theraputic,adorable,loyal, and mans best friend,, in the long run ones pooch is there for you when others go astray,,pooches also protect,and obey,,and in the long , they say one can gain more friends thru owning a adorable pooch.. hope this  helps..also should you decide to get a pooch join freecycle.org which is a strictly free site where many post what they no longer want or use even pets too...i just got a adorable puppy this way on freecycle.org..|`|0q2B11ygaa	a bird <br>  my mom is allergic to animals like  dogs and cats and etc. we got a bird and she was fine we have outdoor dogs as well|`|TAGC3FNOaa	get a rabbit. you can train them like a cat or dog to live in the house. i have one they're lovely!|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Fish.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	are you allergic to dogs too?|`|5K0eYC35aa	A DOG BITC* R U DUMB

Jx0dobejaa	You can always buy one at a pet store (petco)....but the best thing would be to purchase one from a shelter or off of craigsist to help eliminate unwanted ferrets....ferrets are not as easy to care for as a dog or a cat, you need to make sure this is something that your aunt wants, not just something that either one of you think is cute.....I have 4 of them and I LOVE them and I wouldn't change a thing, but they are not for all people, they do DESTROY stuff and FAST.....There are two shelters in the seattle area....washingtonferret.com and washingtonferret.org......I know denise (washingtonferret.com) has over 117 fuzzies, so I'm sure you can find one that you are looking for, and don't rule out shelters, they do have "babies" as well as adult ferrets...another thing you have to think about is that ferrets are very social animals and should be kept in groups of 2 or more....I hope this answered you question.....oh yeah you can go to petfinder.com too.... :)
Rw7gi86Naa	To keep cats out of the garden, the best thing to do first is to lay some soft netting down in rows in between all the flowers. You can use chicken wire also. Put several rocks at the edge of the netting to keep it in place better. You can sprinkle a thin layer of soil over the netting, and use decorative rocks so it‘s not obvious why they are there. If any cat tries to dig in the soil, their claws will get stuck in the netting, (or wire). Next, you can apply some repellent to the rocks. You can purchase some cat repellent at any pet store. Cats don’t like the smell of citrus fruit, so it is an excellent deterrent for gardens and plants. Citrus scented cleaners can be another means of keeping cats out of your garden. Be aware that you will need to re-apply this occasionally since the scent will wash off with water.<br>  <br>  Another idea that may involve less maintenance but more money is to set up sprinklers attached to motion sensors. So when the cat walks near the garden, the sprinklers will turn on, scaring the cat away.<br>  <br>  ** Never use mothballs, because they can harm the cat. Mothballs are composed of naphthalene and/or paradichlorobenzene; both are toxic substances. By law in the US, pesticides can not be used for purposes other than stated on the label. Mothballs are a pesticide. Scattering them over the yard for repelling animals is definitely not on the label. Mothballs have been implicated in several poisonings of small children who mistake them for candy. The label almost certainly states that they are not to be placed where they can be accessed by children. They could also be hazardous for animals such as cats and dogs. **<br>  <br>  ** Burying orange or lemon peels may deter cats, but it may attract other animals such as raccoons. **|`|w1lh1INHaa	Not really.  But, I find covering the beds with stones and pebbles hugely helpful, as well as tossing around a few orange peels.  Even if these aren't your cats,  you can designate a spot for them with easy, puffy soil.  They will prefer that to trying to dig through stones or pebbles.|`|X6PDtlq4aa	They love to dig and that's why they favor your flower bed. Is this outside or is it in a container? I would suggest using something that makes it hard for them to dig in. If it's a container flower bed, try laying down a layer of cotton fabric on top of the soil. The cotton is still absorbent for water but it makes it hard for cats to dig it. Fasten the cotton down with dowels into the soil. You could try this if it's an outdoor flower bed too I suppose- you'll just need a lot of fabric. It'll help for weeds too.|`|nckz5ETbaa	Large decoratie stones..

X6PDtlq4aa	Not being neutered is the number one culprit for the cat's behavior- especially at 6 months old! Get him to the vet pronto before he starts spraying! He's threatened by the other cat and will start displaying "manly" behavior like acting out, scratching and spraying. It's a natural behavioral pattern given the details.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	He should mellow out after being neutered.|`|UJHKyg7kaa	More animals and less attention can always make them be upset.<br>  My cat, is a female and shes getting old (10 years) but she is the sweetest thing. She sometimes goes crazy and she will do the same as your kitten and jump at anything and run around crazily. I think they are mood swings, temperature changes, air pressure changes, they all affect them I believe. My cat has been a little wild for some time now, prob two weeks or so, but I think its because we had a lot of snow, now we have lots of sun!<br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure, sorry, but when you get him neutered next week, check with the vet if hes in depression or anything or if he has something wrong on the inside.

Fmq1YEtyaa	i think ur dog was probably not socialized with other dogs properly. You should have a bag of treats and when a dog comes up to her have the owner of the other dog come slowly and little steps at a time. Keep distracting your dog with the treats while the other dog comes a little closer. When she gets scared turn and walk her away from the dog. When she calms down give her more treats and have the owner with the other dog come closer. When she gets good trying walking side by side far apart and when she gets better at that, get closer and then she will see that other dogs are not that scary! <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	The dogs who are barking at her maintain their distance.  And she's okay with that. The nice dogs are invading her space (by getting close enough to touch). And she's not okay with that.<br>  <br>  It's good that she stays calm around hostile or loud dogs.  That's a great personality to have, one that is calm and not excitable or aggressive back to those dogs. That is really, really good.   Obedience training may help her remain calm around nice dogs that simply want to get to know her and play.  Obedience training is always a good idea.  <br>  <br>  Unlike trainers I see on t.v., etc., I'm not a great believer in forcing dogs to get to know each other if they don't want to.  It's her space, why should those other dogs invade it if she doesn't want them to?  Sort of like if a person comes up to hug us and we don't want them to, but we're forced to take it anyway.  <br>  <br>  But no matter what, an obedience class would be a good thing to get her socialized and around other dogs in a positive way, so she'll react better to nice dogs who approach her, so you might want to check into it.  Plus it will strengthen the bond you have with her as well.|`|a839d39c81c2c929fe1d46e2ceb69bafaa	she needs socalization, take her to dog parks, so she can experince friendly dogs, sounds like she just needs more doggy time to me.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Your first answer is right.

UyKMwdrAaa	A dog that is depressed will be off on their food and will lay around.  They will not want to go out and play or rough house with u.  They might have messes in the house.  The will not want to come to u easily and will just lay there.  They will lay with their head down a lot.  They will actually have a far away dull eye look.  They will not clean themselves (feet face etc) like they normally did.  If you think your dog is depressed check out the reasons why.  But first you want to check out the physical first as some dogs act depressed when there is something physical going on.  Ex.  Urinary tract infections, liver problems, heart problems.  It's best to have a vet check them over if u are noticing something different with them.   They can also act depressed with worms.

Grow some wheat grass, it's pretty cheap, or pick grass from outside if it's not treated with chemicals.  Parsley is cheap, less than a dollar's worth will last you several days.  Look for deals, sometimes you can get a large bag of dark greens like spinach for a dollar.  Hay at pet stores is VERY expensive, so find where you can buy a bale from a farmer, usually less than 5 dollars, and store in a large plastic container to keep it dry.<br>  <br>  See helpful sites below.
mfXDUkRYaa	Depending on the individual dog and how much time you can devote to it, then it could be either.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to house train and go to puppy classes, could cope with chewing and are around for much of the day, then a young puppy could be ideal as you can do all the early socialisation you want.<br>  <br>  However, you may find a housebroken, well-behaved, well-socialised older dog in rescue, and find you don't have to put so much work into it.|`|UyKMwdrAaa	It would probably be best to adopt a puppy especially if its pit bull.  Sometimes pit bulls can be a little more aggressive if they have had a bad life and are older.  They can be wonderful dogs don't get me wrong but it's totally on what kind of life they have had.  A puppy you can grow up to how u want it and give it lots of love so it never has to have the experience of a bad life.  You would have to deal with less issues then,except the potty training.  But if u don't have kids u can give this puppy lots of time and devotion.  Good luck!|`|msAh2tItaa	any age is fine there are pluses and minuses to both with an adult you can find one that is already house trained with a puppy you get to do all the training and raising so you know exactly how your dog will react. it is all personal experience and depends on how much time you have to spend with your new pet puppies take lots of time and Patience where as adult dogs dont require as much training.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	My criteria is which needs a home the most.<br>  Which has been passed over the most<br>  <br>  That's the one that will appreciate you the most til the day it goes to Rainbow Bridge.<br>  <br>  I personally, prefer an adult after going through the puppy thing once.<br>  I didn't dislike everything a puppy requires, I just appreciated more what an adult has to offer.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	i think a puppy so it can bond with you more but then agine a 1 year old dog should be housed trained already|`|a839d39c81c2c929fe1d46e2ceb69bafaa	it all depends on how much time you can devote to the dog, lots get a puppy lil get a used dog they may already have the skills you wnat them to have ie sit, stay lay down, outside to go to the bathroom, puppies require LOTS of attentions and Training.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Not really.  Dog food is actually very low in protein, and has a ton of carbs and plant matter that ferrets don't need.  Try chicken or turkey (raw or cooked), a hardboiled egg, chicken/turkey baby food. Offer it to them, but it's okay if they don't eat it.  Contrary to what most believe, one 24 hour period of not eating will not harm your ferrets (as long as they are not insulinomic and they have plenty of water).<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Jx0dobejaa	Absolutely NOT!  Ferrets are strict carnivores, whereas dogs are omnivores.....if you ran out of ferret food you can feed your ferrets some common household foods.....they can eat raw or cooked eggs, lunch meat (ok in small quantities), raw chicken, chicken livers (anything chicken), you can even cut off chicken wing tips and feed it to them (my little girl loves them & the bones are good for digestion), beef (they tipically don't like beef), really any meat product.....you can look up BARF diets on the internet and it will tell you what you can and can't feed to them.....if you where going to feed them any other food I would say feed them cat food....ferrets are junk food junkies....they like most food they shouldn't have and it's REALLY bad for them....when feeding your ferret anything you should make sure that the first FOUR ingredients are meat and meat byproduct, even in ferret food......most companies put "fillers" (corn and rice, which is BAD for ferrets) in their food......hope this helps

Here is a list of the ingredients:<br>  <br>  Whole grain corn, poultry by-product meal, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), corn gluten meal, meat and bone meal, brewers rice, soybean meal, barley, whole grain wheat, animal digest, calcium carbonate, salt, calcium phosphate, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, zinc proteinate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2, Yellow 6), DL-Methionine, manganese sulfate, manganese proteinate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, copper sulfate, calcium pantothenate, copper proteinate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, Vitamin B-12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate, Vitamin D-3 supplement, riboflavin supplement, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite. <br>  S-4101 <br>  <br>  The first ingredient is corn--a cheap protein that has little nutritional value.  It contains 'poultry by-product meal' which can come from ANY bird and means it can contain parts other than meat (including feet, beaks, feathers, tumors, etc.).  It also contains 'animal digest' (it's what you think it is), 'meat and bone meal' which can come from ANY animal (yes, even roadkill), wheat (another filler) as well as artificial colors.  Yuck!<br>  <br>  When looking for a high-quality food for dogs, look for one with species-specific meat or meal as the first ingredient (ie: chicken or chicken meal--meal is better as it simply means the water has been removed from the meat), no wheat, corn or soy, no by-products, and no artificial colors or flavors.<br>  <br>  I feed my dog Life's Abundance, which meets the above criteria and is all-natural, holistic, and manufactured entirely in the US.

6SeWCfUfaa	No, I do NOT think the proper place to take an undersocialized dog is to a dog park.  I think the proper place to socialize an undersocialized dog is in a much more controlled environment such as obedience classes.<br>  <br>  People taking their undersocialized, untrained, and stupid selves to dog parks is why my dog doesn't go to dog parks.  I can go by any dogpark, any day of the week and will find a dog that's overly aggressive and find at least one person that is smoking a cigarette, talking on the cell phone and drinking coffee instead of watching their dog.  This kind of thing makes dog parks a dangerous place for both dogs and people.<br>  <br>  The only dogs that should be going to dog parks are properly socialized dogs with no history of aggression towards dogs or people.  And the only people who should take their dogs to parks are those who want to interact with their dog while at the park.  If you're taking the dog there just to play with other dogs, you're going for the wrong reasons.<br>  <br>  And yes, I have very strong feelings about this kind of thing.  Dog parks will go away if people keep abusing them.|`|AA11026827	An undersocialized or unsocial dog does not belong in a dog park.  That's what training classes and groups are for.  That way there is another person to observe and step in.<br>  <br>  Owners of unsocial dogs want so badly for the dog to fit in, that they'll ignore signals that the dog is giving off, and even slightly bad behavior, and they'll excuse it hoping that their dog will stop doing it and starting playing.  It ends up dangerous for other dogs involved.<br>  <br>  There are groups that you can get into for socialization, but a public dog park is not a place for that.  It's a place for the dogs that are social to play with each other and have fun, or for the owners to be able to play with their dogs in an open area, off leash.<br>  <br>  That's just my thoughts on it.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	I would say no.  A dog park can be a very terrifying place for a dog who already has issues.  I would start out with increasing the daily walks in high traffic areas.  Then a group obedience class or two.  Then maybe walking around the outside of the dog park.  The next step would be going to the dog park during an "off" time, like in the middle of the day when there aren't a lot of dogs there. <br>  <br>  I personally really dislike the dog parks around here.  Nobody cleans up after their dogs, it is really gross!|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Depends on the manifestation of the undersocialization and how busy the park is.  For dogs that cower in fear, a dog park with rowdy dogs can be a living nightmare.  They will have a hard time recovering. Especially if the owner takes them off the leash and leaves them to fend for themselves. <br>  <br>  For dogs that are a little unsure of themselves, going during a non-busy time and staying near the dog, controlling the exposure to other dogs, it can be good.  <br>  <br>  My little one does not like big dogs in uncontrolled situations, but we go to our huge dog park and stick to ourselves.  I'm lucky that our park is like 10 acres, so there is plenty of room for us to have small dog time in the middle and to powerwalk around the edges.  There are lots of people who bring unsocialized dogs there, and the responsible ones usually keep them leashed for the first few visits, or until the dog starts to pull on the leash to try and play.  The leash is their safety net.  <br>  <br>  For beginners, PetSmart or small group training programs are a much more secure way of doing it.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	in general no, but it really depends on the park.  <br>  there is one park in the area where i live that usually has only a few dogs.   the park has 2 areas (that can be separated from one another).  i've seen people arrange to meet their friends with dogs at that park and socialize their dogs that way.  i have seen it work very well.  but i have also seen shy dogs getting attacked at another park i go to.  i would not recommend people bring dogs there to socialize.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	if they are adult dogs and have not been socialized. I would start somewhere else. <br>  <br>  dog fights *do* happen at dog parks, it is a very scary thing.<br>  <br>  now if is a puppy- then it could be different<br>  <br>  dog parks are at your own risk.<br>  but I would take the under-socialized dog somewhere WAY less stressful. then *maybe* take it to the dog park|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	No way.  I think dog parks are a bad idea in general.  Let's take a bunch of dogs from different packs and toss them together and expect them all to accept each other and get along.  Not a good way to socialize any dog.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	No - it would be like throwing a non-swimmer in at the deep end.<br>  <br>  I always think small steps are best.|`|v3fL81Bjaa	It looks like you're getting mostly responses in the negative to your question, and I have to agree. You do not have the degree of control necessary to prevent unfortunate incidents from happening. It's not that you don't have control of your dog, it's the worry that others won't or can't control theirs. I worry about that in any public place.<br>  <br>  Training classes or other controlled situations, plus taking the dog with you to various places is a better way to work on socialization, IMO, than a dog park with lots of unfamiliar dogs running loose.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Dog parks are excellent places to help pups and dogs get socialized. Does this mean you should walk in on a Saturday morning around 11 with almost 100 other dogs there? Of course not. As with anything, things need to be taken slow. People need to be aware of their surroundings. If you see a dog that's out of control, it's time to leave or find another part of the park. I've used dog parks as a major part of my dogs socialization. I always know who's dog mine are playing with and if things get rough i whistle them away and keep walking. As long as you stay in control of you own dog(s) and be aware of your surroundings, I think they are a great thing to have in the neighborhood.<br>  <br>  And the people who have nasty or out of control dogs normally don't last too long in the park without getting asked to leave.|`|b3HR6KqTaa	I wouldn't. Even if you kept your dog on a leash the other dogs would not be. Some dogs that go to these parks are very dominant and might do more harm than good. I'd start by walking him through the pet store a few times a week (weekends are pretty busy so if you are up for it do it then) And then look into classes or even just a doggie social in a petstore setting. <br>  <br>  If your dog gets so nervous that he/she nips I would be sure to get a muzzle for the pet store walks. You don't want a child to startle it!|`|Db3mJRUGaa	We took our 1 1/2 year old Lab to a play care center where we live.  It's the best thing that we've ever spent money on.  This particular center makes sure that your dog is evaluated to see if it would get along well with the other dogs.  Our dog is much calmer and better behaved around other dogs now.

That and the dog park is a very uncontrolled situation.  It can be good for an older animal that has been socialized but just starting out? No.|`|AA10412922	No,too many dogs with poor manners or just a rowdy personality.A timid pup needs a more controlled situation,more one on one activity than multiple dogs running up to him|`|qioH81tiaa	Socialization isn't about throwing your dog in with any other dog that happen to be there.<br>  <br>  Socialization is about exposing your puppy to situations YOU can control.  It's about exposing your puppy to different environments that YOU can control.  It's about setting your puppy up to succeed.  <br>  <br>  Dog parks, at best, give you an area to work on off-leash work with distractions.  They aren't there to help you with socializing your puppy.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	As the pack leader a puppy/dog expects its owner to protect it from non pack members. A responsible dog owner learns to manage their dog's fears and control their dog's environment. A puppy/dog with fearful temperament can learn not to cower at the sight of dogs, but a dog park would be the worst place to begin to manage the fear.<br>  <br>  The temperament of the pup/dog doesn't change, but behaviour can. Calm leadership encourages a fearful dog to let the owner worry about the world. The dog should be trained to focus on the handler & ignore distraction like other dogs. Initially you only want a few distractions, so a dog park would be an extreme overload for a fearful dog. Over time, the level of distraction could be increased.<br>  <br>  {With time and patience, this approach worked for a weak nerved Dobermann}<br>  <br>  Ideally pups/dogs should be exposed to people, other dogs, animals and new environments and activities.  The more positive and varied the young dog’s experiences are, the more rounded and confident they will be as an adult.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	No, the environment is too uncontrolled, and people who have timid/fearful dogs usually don't have the experience to prevent their dog from getting into a situation that would frighten them further.<br>  <br>  I prefer to take such a dog to obedience classes, so they can get used to the presence of other dogs in a more controlled environment.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I have to say it depends on the dog and the situation.<br>  <br>  Let me explain:<br>  The dog park near me has a large dog and a small dog section.  Nobody ever uses the small dog section.  <br>  I have taken a friend there at "off times" to help her dog "warm up" to the idea of being around other dogs in a controlled situation by taking the dog into the small dog side and letting her check out the other dogs through the fence.  The dogs could not "get her", and we praised and treated her as she became more familiar with the surroundings and the idea of other dogs.  Eventually, a couple of owners (who I knew) brought their dogs (who were good at playing "gently") came into the small dog part to visit her.  This became a great source of positive reinforcement and learning.  <br>  <br>  If we had just shown up and tossed her in to be trampled by a big pack of dogs right away - I have no doubt we would have ruined that dog for good.  But, the park was a great way for this dog to join the action without fear.

YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Okay,have you got any toys for him/her? Rabbits can so very easily get bored,so they need stimulation! Provide balls/treat balls,tunnels,empty loo spools & even some parrot toys are great! Bedding? I personally use thick chip pine wood-shavings,used for horses. Carefresh bedding is perfect too,although for my medium sized herd,it would cost a lot!<br>  <br>  A Rabbits diet should consist of up to 80-90% fibre,such as Hay. Meadow or Timothy is perfect. Plus Mixes or Pellets,for vitamins/minerals & calories. An average Dwarf-Medium sized rabbit of around 2-4kgs(1kg is equal to 2.2lbs) No more than 4 ounces per day of mix,which is roughly 1/2 a cup i think! I feed my Dwarf,Mini,Cashmeres & Dutch 2-1/2 ounces of Mix each daily. Its an ounce per kg. Greens can be fed & add variety to a rabbits diet,i only feed a few greens 1-2 x's a week. I also feed 'Readigrass',which is freeze dried grass,since the Guinea Pigs have it & the rabbits also enjoy it! Not sure if the US has it though...<br>  <br>  Anyway,sounds like you have everything else needed! Good luck to the new addition to the Family! xxx
GSf09ALBaa	Jessica, I got your first question just fine.  I couldn't get my answer in because you deleted it.  Okay, so let's try this agan.  <br>  <br>  You rescued a dog.  Good for you!  That's a start.  You have a 2 year old dog that has probably never been given a chance at obedience or housebreaking.  And we all know small dogs are harder to housebreak.  Why?  Because they are small and sneaky.  That's my opinion. (lol)  Taking him out only twice a day is not really enough.  It would be ideal if you had a fenced in yard and it wouldn't have to be very big.  But, since you don't, we have to work with what we have.  I suggest taking him out more when you are home.  Even if he doesn't have to go, he needs to get out, sniff, roll in the grass etc.  More outings are going to benefit both you (and bf) and the dog.<br>  <br>  When you are home with him, keep areas of the house blocked off with baby gates so you can see where he is at all times.  That way, when he starts to go, you catch him in the act, give a correction such as NO, pick him up and go outside.  Once he does it outside, give so much praise you sound like an idiot and a treat.  <br>  <br>  During the day, he should be kenneled.  If you can possibly get a neighbor or a friend to come by and let him out at least once that would be good for him.  My dogs sleep mostly.  But this little guy needs some extra attention right now so try and find someone who can do that for you.<br>  <br>  In your last question, you mentioned the excitement peeing.  He is going to do this for awhile.  He is happy and obviously loves you.  Give it a bit more time and see if this doesn't take care of itself.

Heck my big dogs need to go out more than that and they've got bladders the size of your dog.|`|HgMFrllLaa	You say you "let your dog out twice a day".

BH7VpjJNaa	The best way to potty train is to crate train.  I was worried at first that it would be cruel, but my dogs loved their crate and it was very easy to train them.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	i have a lab that i got at six months and had zero issues training her.. course realisticly i didn't train her.. my other two dogs did... seems like if you have one or more that are trained right.. they train the puppies for ya|`|i9f0QWMdaa	a dog is a dog some are more stubborn than others just do what you'd do with anyother dog. its not all that hard.

But keep looking they are out there.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	There are purple budgies and I have bred many of them. They are called violets and more importantly the ones that look really purple are called "visual" violets. <br>  They are not rare and they are not hard to breed.

AA10229248	Wow, this is the third time I've seen this question this week. Here's what I told the last two askers:<br>  <br>  - Get a tennis ball and use a knife or razor blade to put a 1 inch slice in it. <br>  - Squeeze the ball so the slice opens up. (kinda like a change purse)<br>  - Drop some dog treats inside the ball. <br>  - When you stop squeezing, the ball will close and the treats will be inside. <br>  - Let your dog smell the ball so she knows the treats are inside. <br>  - Throw the ball.<br>  - The dog will chase the ball but can't get the treats out of it.<br>  - Tell the dog "bring it to me" or "fetch" or whatever your command is.<br>  - When the dog brings the ball, squeeze it so the slice opens up and the treats fall out.<br>  <br>  Pretty soon she'll figure out that if she brings the ball to you she'll get the treats out of it. Eventually you can phase out the treats because she'll be in the habit of brining the ball back.<br>  <br>  This is how we teach the dogs in flyball that don't have a very strong ball drive.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	For some dogs fetching is just natural, others you must really work hard to train them. It is easier when you start with a small puppy, but adults can also learn. Get him a very special toy, but don't let him haave it. With him near you, just play with the toy. You must really act as if you enjoy it very much playing with this toy. You must almost make him jealous about this toy. Then stop and put the toy somewhere high where he can see it, but not get it. Next day do the same, and the next. Then all of a sudden, when it seems that he really wants this toy throw it and run for it, but let him pick it up, then turn around and run and call him. Just encourage him to carry the toy. If he drops it, that fine just pick it up and play with it again. This might take long, but the crazy you act, the more he will enjoy this game and the likely you will succeed in teaching him to fetch.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yea, I can teach any dog to force fetch, but some just really don't see the fun in it.  An Aussie mix, can be taught to enjoy it though.  What you have is an independent streak in the dog.  Running off with the ball is saying, hey, chase me for it!!  It'll be fun!!  There's a way around that.<br>  <br>  My Aussie was the SAME way.  And will still occasionally try that.  So I basically bribed him.  A pocket full of good low fat low sodium swiss cheese cut into chunks, mmmmm.  Yea he'll bring me the ball back, to hand, for one of those.  <br>  <br>  Start slow by keeping him on a leash so he can't take off far, and just sorta drop lob the ball for him so he doesn't have to drag you anywhere to get the ball, then trade, ball for treat.  Start by rewarding him when he drops the ball anywhere near you, then start rewarding only when it's really close by.  Then only reward when the ball ends up in your hand.<br>  <br>  After a while you can start rewarding every other throw, then every third, then when his enthusiasm for bring it back starts to wan a bit ... but usually after they start getting the hang of it, they find that fetching is actually fun and the reward of you throwing the ball again is enough.|`|AA12240972	You can try just calling him back, then training him to drop it.  But some dogs just want the toy - lol.  And that's ok too!  My lab just wanted her toy, she loved to chase it and all but then she just wanted to lie down and chew it up.  My bassett however loves to fetch, but only for me, not for anyone else.  Dogs are all diff.|`|V1pOG3Cgaa	Yes, some breeds will not bring the ball back to you. My shiba inu will run to a ball but will look at me like "You come here and get it." I guess if I wanted him to bring the ball back I would positive train with small treats that way he would for sure come back with the ball eventually.|`|RehgySLCaa	To teach a dog to play fetch you first have to teach him to play tug of war, you can get the kind of ball that's on a rope or just use the ball it self. He'll enjoy trying to rip it out of your hands, once you get him really excited throw the ball not that far though. He'll run after the ball and this is when you have to wait for him to finally bring it back. He'll bring it back because he wants to play tug of war again, but you praise him for bringing it. Soon enough he'll put two and two together and fetch for you.<br>  <br>  That's how i've done it with 3 dogs|`|HgMFrllLaa	Certain dog breeds will never learn to fetch. Or better, don't care for it.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	throw the ball and get all into the game of fetch once he has the ball in his mouth say good boy and give him a treat then he"ll know to grab the ball.Then just throw the ball and call him back once he is near you take the ball but at the same time offer the treat!
70j0Bmzdaa	sounds like bloat. can be caused by dry mix food or just the feeding bowl at the wrong hieght.<br>  the dog eats food and at the same time swallows air into the stomach <br>  usually the air is expelled either burping (yes dogs burp) or farting<br>  but sometimes the air gets trapped causing the stomach to knot litrally<br>  this causes the lining to tear or burst.<br>  it can be quite common with bull terriers and mastiffs although it can happen with any breed.|`|2O58btqxaa	it could of been any thing i had a Yorkie mix like this and she died i thing she had a fit in the night  sorry|`|lQC5S37Paa	idk im so sorry:(|`|50ZS5azEaa	I'm so sorry because I had a 6 week old peek-a-poo puppy and he died three days later. It might have gotten dehydrated so the person who gave the puppy to your friend probably couldn't care for it or pay the vet bill so the person gave it away. it probably had a very bad disease and your friend was the unlucky person to get the puppy.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	i dont know really - sounds like she might of ate something - i know certain things dogs cannot eat - was there onions or anything laying on the floor ?? might of jut had something wrong with it or at something she shouldnt have . soooo sorry!!!|`|AA12240972	sounds like maybe something was already wrong and affecting his organ function.  I had a dog hit by a car once who did that like a day later, with no signs of trauma until then.|`|yV20AX5Daa	Well first off, that sucks! It's doubtful it was something he ate. Puppies have such a high metabolism, anything they eat just goes in and comes out, if you get what I'm saying. It could have been worms, although I've never had any personal experience with a dog that had worms, or even seen a dog that had worms for that matter. I would agree with the other answer on here; he was probably sick to begin with, organ failure or something neurological, but what caused it? Anybody's guess
4hFT5JcLaa	It kind of depends on how big of an area you have, the type of dwarf hamster, and the genders of the two.<br>  <br>  Siberian dwarf hamsters, for example, tend to do better on their own.|`|K7AhV4Diaa	A dwarf hamster should really need a friend because i read somewher that there is a chance tht they would die earlier if they had none of their species to communicate to or play with. Just by him/her a friend and he/she will get happy. Do not leave it by itself where it will be lonely. <br>  Thanks for your question.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Dwarf Hamsters, like most rodents, do need buddies!

They were sisters but they hated each other and just wanted to be alone.  Some hasmters will just be that way.  Now I have 2 brothers who play fight ALL the time but really get along great.  <br>  <br>  the bottom line, its good because they like company, but it wont hurt them to be alone, as long as they have an interesting cage setup so they aren't bored all the time.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	either is fine. ive got 1 who lives alone. he has lived longer than my other dwarfs that lived in groups<br>  <br>  the hamster will NOT die earlier if its on its own. mine is nearly 3 years old. when i had a group of them they only lived 1.5 years, some just made it to 2 years old|`|JxmJg37Iaa	roborovski dwarf hamstrers and russian campbell dwarf hamsters need companionship of there kind, however chinese dwarf hamsters do better off on their own as they will fight once they reach maturity|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I found when I had 2 dwarf hamsters in the same cage at once they always got into fights. I think they do better when they have their own space.
mOayTJDmaa	He'll get horny.  Seriously, my friend just got a second rabbit and the boy was all over her.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Well your rabbit Eddie is now at the age where he needs a woman in his life , so one would say get this poor lonely Blighter a girl rabbit . Eddie sounds a fine chap to me so do not be alarmed if Eddie does not give all his attention to you if one gets him a female friend . Also do not be alarmed if one hears romantic music at night comming from the rabbit hutch , it's just Eddie trying to impress his female companion with a candle lit dinner fine food wine champagne etc .<br>                     Kindest regards , cheerio .|`|6ecFkkAkaa	Most likely, Eddie will fall hopelessly in love with his new lady friend that he will get a little protective of her. When Eddie shares a space with a female, chances are he will gravitate toward her because she is not only another rabbit for him to socialize with, but she's a female as well. Even if she's spayed and unable to have babies, Eddie may try things with her. I think, though, that as long as you keep Eddie social with humans, he should still be friendly with you. It's good for him to have rabbit company, but it's also good for him to be around people (if you want him to stay friendly with you). But don't worry -- you'll always be Eddie's number 1 girl! :) Good luck and God Bless!|`|RjlBrP98aa	If he likes the girl and the girl likes him, they will bond which involves a lot of mounting eachother and chasing eachother around and eventually grooming. That should calm down once they bond and they will be best buds to sleep, eat, poo, and cuddle together. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about him not loving you as much anymore, quite the contrary he will likely be happier and want more love than before. They will also keep eachother company when you aren't around to love on them.<br>  <br>  Not all bunnies will get along and bond. It may take time to bond a girl with him, and some girls may just not be the right one. You may want to contact a local rescue group which you can find at www.rabbit.org (click adoptions) and see if they have any available females to do a trial bonding with him - they will help you bond them which can take days or weeks. <br>  <br>  I definitely think it's a great idea and good luck! :)|`|rQgW7EaLaa	it probably would probably breed unless you watch them and when they try to stop him but i had a male and a female and she got pregnate the same day i put them in the cage together and after i split them apart he got like depressed thats what the doctor said and after awhile he died and the vet said it was because the other rabbit was away from him and he died of depression!!!!!

pLv0Ejt9aa	Well first you have to train her to walk on leash without pulling. Once you can walk with her anywhere with her right next to you, not pulling but with a loose leash, you can drop te leash with her not noticing. When she goes wide, call her back in. It will take time. Don't expect too much too soon.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Teaching your dog to comply with you when he's off leash can be hard. Although some dogs make the transition easily, without seeming to notice that the leash is no longer attached to their collar, other dogs will take off for a long and potentially dangerous run.<br>  Do not attempt to do off-leash work with a puppy. Only mentally mature, well-trained dogs should be worked off leash.<br>  To keep your dog safe, never attempt to train off leash without following the training steps. In addition, always be aware of where you are and what is surrounding you. Train inside with the outside doors closed or train outside in a securely fenced area. Make sure no one is going to open the door or gate and leave it open while your dog is off leash. Be aware and be safe.<br>  <br>  Before starting any off-leash training, evaluate your dog.<br>  If he's less than eighteen months of age, give him some time to grow up. Although there are a few exceptions, most dogs under eighteen months of age are still mentally immature. <br>   Some dogs are still mentally immature at two or even three years of age. If your dog has a hard time concentrating on anything (except maybe his dinner) and he is easily distracted, wait a while longer before beginning this training.  Your dog should know all the basic obedience exercises well and do them reliably. He should be able to perform all of them without lures, although food rewards are still fine. <br>  What breed (or mixtures of breeds) is your dog? Some breeds have a difficult time controlling themselves off leash. Many of the sighthounds, especially retired and rescued racing greyhounds, should not be off leash outside of a fenced-in yard. If you have a breed (or an individual dog) that was bred to run, is known to be stubborn, or is particularly defiant, be cautious doing off-leash work.<br>  If you feel you can safely begin off-leash training, find a place where you and your dog can be safe. A fenced-in yard with a secure gate is great.<br>  <br>  Have your dog on leash, Sitting in the Heel position by your left side. Have some really good food treats in your pocket with a few in your right hand. <br>  Tuck the leash into the left pocket of your pants, or if you don't have pockets, into the waistband of your pants. Maintain your left hand in its normal position as if you were still holding the leash. <br>  Do a Watch Me with the treats in your right hand. <br>  When you have your dog's attention, move forward, “Fido, Heel! Good boy!” <br>  After several steps, stop and have your dog Sit. Praise him. <br>  Do a total of five repetitions and give your dog a break or practice something else. <br>  Repeat these training steps over a couple of weeks, gradually making the distance you walk longer. Then make the Heel itself more challenging. Walk a zigzag pattern, turn corners to the right and to the left, Heel in a figure eight pattern, and do quick about-turns. Heeling by itself can be boring, and although your dog needs this practice, nothing says you and he must both be bored by doing it.|`|kGGlxvkXaa	first you need to get your dog on the leash. then walk if it does reward it praise it give it a treat.

PM23RDycaa	The only dog that will never get sick is a stuffed one. Every living creature gets ill or sick at one point or another, that is life. There is no way to avoid it. HOWEVER to prevent serious illness and injury you want to feed your dog a good quality kibble, no table scraps, make sure it is always UTD on shots, gets the proper exercise, train it not to go digging through the garbage for this that will make it sick. If you buy a puppy from a breeder make sure you purchase from a breeder who has the proper genetic clearances on the adults they breed.|`|lQC5S37Paa	gO TO THE VET,|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	If you mean vomit then just like moms with babies you will find that on the occasions when your dog vomits (which should be rare) you just get over it and clean it up. <br>  If you mean you are afraid of your dog ever getting sick or hurt ... well everyone who loves their dog is afraid the dog will get sick or hurt ... illness and injury are facts of life and never 100% avoidable.

dLhRrTlRaa	If you have room in your heart to take in a dog into your life you can make it work.  There are several options you can do to make it work!<br>  <br>  Hire a dog walker to come take fido for a nice long stroll.<br>  Take your dog on Tuesdays & Thursdays to "doggie daycare" where they run & play all day under supervised care with other dogs.  Remember - a tired dog is a well behaved happy dog!  :D<br>  Are you near enough that you can run home for lunch?  You could have a permenant lunch buddy... (wink)<br>  <br>  Labs are mouthy and insatiable chewers until about two years old, Danes are usually very mellow loungers that should not have tremendous amounts of exercise due to their rapidly growing muscles/bones/joints.  Both are great dogs but the Dane will always come first in my heart.  If you get a Dane get one at 8 weeks (no younger or it won't have the socialization it needs from it's mother) from a reputable breeder with health certified parents.  Feed high quality, low protien kibble and look forward to enjoying your canine friend!|`|PkjZA2o9aa	yeh i would def. take a few days off like you said though since it will be there all by itself, plus it needs to get use to you and the home. ppl do it all the time. no need to get someone to walk it during the day, just do it before and after work. having a big dog is great when your not at home, protects the house. i say go for it if your up for the resposibility.|`|lQC5S37Paa	it should be okay as long as you will be there part of the day|`|kkjHSVOTaa	The puppy should be fine. Set up an area in your backyard where there is plenty of sun and shade. Have some toys in there fo that the puppy doesn't get bored and has plenty of water. When you have this area, the puppy learns to go in that area and you don't have to play 'Hide and Poop.' The earlier you start training him, the better. Puppies have a short attention span, so 30min a day is probably good. Just start with the basics, 'Sit', 'Stay', and 'Lay Down.' The more you praise them, the more they will want to obey. Create a game with you puppy, make it fun for the both of you. Just whatever you do, don't try to tug a toy out of his mouth every time you play fetch.|`|tw6qP6S0aa	Well first off, do you really have the time for a dog?<br>  If the answer is yes, then you should think about it, but it really isnt healthy for a dog to be owned by someone and walked by someone else. Training a dog takes time and effort, andif you are never home that would be hard, and then you would need to have the dog fed,m and probably a yard, and a nice neighberhood, but really do you think you have the time and effort?>|`|2G6b5y8Taa	i dont think its a good thing puppys need alot of time and potty training will be hard if no one is home all day|`|00ffa92320953b7b22bb9e4f9d3522f3aa	I say go for it.  I have 2 dogs, a bull-mastiff border collie (7 yrs) and a puggle (2yrs).  My larger dog I got already trained from my sister and she was use to being home during the day, but the puggle I got as a puppy, I took a few extra days off work to be with her and work on potty training, bought the puppy playpen and also paper trained her , got her training classes the whole thing.  It did take a little longer cuz I wasn't home all day long every day, but she caught on fast.  Now they pretty much just sleep and play with each other during the day, they are not destructive, but I never allowed them to be (bitter apple spray works wonders).  They have plenty of toys and bones to play with, we play when I get home and go for walks at night and the dog park on the weekends.  I wouldn't change a thing.  And they are happy!|`|Qxx0svOVaa	I say don't go for a puppy. Try looking in local animal shelters, not only would you rescue a dog, but something that is young but not a puppy would be perfect. Potty Training and other chores are hard for a puppy to get used to and it would take more than a week. We had the same situation as you and ended up buying a dog that was almost a year old, that way, he was potty trained and could be left a home for good amount of time. I suggest you think about it carefully and make sure you have someone to walk the new addition ;)|`|YFKPf7e2aa	19 months ago I was in ALMOST the same situation. My fiance and I got our first house together and I had always wanted a dog...my OWN dog. Not "the family" dog. I had always had dogs growing up, but they were more my parents than mine. So anyway, we both work, and we're both gone a minimum of 9 hours a day. Well, we decided to get a dog anyway. We got a husky. One of THE MOST demanding dogs you can get, but oh we just had to have him! So, 19 months later and one big furry spoiled rotten husky, we wouldn't have done it differently if we had to do over. <br>  <br>  It takes a lot of patiencre, and investing in a good crate is super important. Also, devoting a few hours to play and excercise time when you get home from work, and I honestly think..well I KNOW you can have a very happy, and heathy dog.|`|d3baaec2db2c56bde7d391e4da1b0616aa	As long as you are willing to have someone come look in on him several times a day, it should be fine. I say several because your puppy will have accidents in the house if you stay gone too long. Also, 10 hours is a long time for him/her to be in a crate, if that is where you intend to keep them. Housebreaking may also take longer because of inconsistency. You may also wish to see about taking the puppy to doggy day care a few times a week, after he has had all of his puppy shots. Or better yet, find a puppy sitter to stay with him for at least 6 hours while you and your husband are gone.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	10 hours is pretty long especially for a puppy. Perhaps adopt an older dog ... one with a full size bladder and then you should still hire someone to come by and walk your dog. If you have experience as a dog owner (but it doesn't sound like you do) you might consider getting two dogs so they can keep each other company during the day. Yes other people do it ... that doesn't make it the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that people who work full time shouldn't have dogs, just that perhaps a puppy is not the best fit right now for your lifestyle.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	Well It's not recommended but I don't think people should not be able to keep a dog just because they work and as you have given it thought, I don't see why not.<br>  Our dogs are left for about 8 hours a day, due to my mum having to return to work, however we do have a dog walker who takes them out for three hours with other dogs; which is something you have considered and I would definitely recommend it.<br>  However a puppy may not be a good plan as they need time and company and so it's not the best idea. I'd recommend an adult dog.<br>  When we where looking for a second dog, I tried finding one that would be ok left alone, I didn't find many but the one I remember was the large Munsterlander so you could look into that breed, I'm not sure about Great Danes but I have know Labradors that have been left and have been fine and others that haven't taken lightly to it, so it depends on the dog.<br>  Sometimes it is best to have two dogs so they have one anothers company, often there are dogs in rescues that come in pairs so that may be an option as well.<br>  I hope this helped and have fun with your dog, if you decide to go ahead and get one :)|`|Uu4fvRIQaa	Our dog gets left at home for a few hours most days but she's quite old and must be used to it a bit now. I wouldn't go for a puppy, perhaps get a rescue dog or something? (:|`|FnrAw2SQaa	If you plain to get a dog dont get a puppy.<br>  they need all your time and attention!<br>  but if you want a puppy then you should get a small breed dog because a large puppy will get bored and become destructive.<br>  Do not get A LAB!<br>  i love labs but if you get a lab puppy when they become older they are destructive you need to be with them about 75% of your time so they dont become bored!|`|2O58btqxaa	it should be ok as long as some one pops in during the day to let it out

Also remember that if she is sensing something wrong with a family member she might be nervous. I've notice this gets worse with age.|`|SJEqXq21aa	well im not sure but they say that dogs do stuff like that when they're going to die because they're saying bye..<br>  but i dunno i don't wanna scare u just take her to the vet poor thing she might be sick.|`|u76FjmDkaa	the fact that she is old might have to do with.. your dog is 11 years old.. thats quite old/ good luck
7kMeaccWaa	this doesn't really answer your question but it'll probably help a bit:<br>  <br>  Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohydrosis to cool themselves.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Birds don't have sweat glands so they don't sweat.

You may see your hamster rear up on his back legs like a bear and sniff the air. That's one of his ways of figuring out what's going on around him. Your hamster will come to know you by your scent, especially if you handle him daily. If you are having trouble picking up your new hamster, you may want to rub your hands on the bedding in his cage so that you disguise your scent with the familiar smell of his bedding. Likewise, if you want your hamster to be comfortable in a new cage, try putting some of the bedding from his old cage in the new enclosure. The familiar smell will help ease his transition.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It works just like ours, except they also have a scent glan on the roof of their mouths to help them smell also. Kind of like a cat.

Um8osMNuaa	Blood in the poo is a sign of parvo, although if he's acting normally, eating and drinking then l doubt that's the problem. lt could be worms, they can irritate the stomach lining and cause bleeding, also straining to poo if he's constipated can cause it.<br>  Although it could also be a few other things, it is best, especially with him being a puppy to see the vet, puppies can quickly go down hill once they get sick, the sooner you get him seen the better.|`|AA11457471	Anything like that should be checked by your vet. <br>  There's a thousand possibilities- some no big deal, others serious.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Has he had his shots and dewormed?

Even if he is acting fine utd on shots and deworming etc, he vary well may have some sort of protozoal infection.  So please call your vet and set up and appointment for a fecal and wet mount.|`|UIueiJnZaa	This happens a lot with puppies in work. (I work in the RSPCA re-homing centre)<br>  How much blood was in the stool? And was there mucus visible also?

If there is something then just put it up so he can't get to it anymore. If there isn't anything just wait for about 1 week and if it hasn't changed or if it has got worse, then get your pup checked out by a pro Vet A.S.A.P. hope he is ok!!!|`|HcboXOmjaa	Bring the fecal sample into the vet and have it tested.

tPGxPDvBaa	Each dog is different. Danes have a hard time cuz for some crazy reason they want really long crops on them. These were not the breed standard & they used to be cropped short like a pit when they were actually hunting. But anyway it takes months to over a year for them to stand correctly & often will need additional work.  There are plenty of sneaky ppl who will use silicone injections to get them right for the show ring.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are using a vet who does crops for the majority of show dogs in the area for the proper technique.  If you have a quality dane you don't need to crop to win.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	Some dogs it takes a longer time, some a shorter time.<br>  Your vet should be able to give you a much better ideal estimate for this than any of us would be able to.<br>  I really couldn't tell you, though.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	With a longer show crop you can expect have to tape from anywhere from a couple of months up to 18 months.   The longer crops in general take longer to stand but each dog is unique and different lines may stand quicker or take longer as may individual dogs in the lines.    When you get your show Dane his/her breeder should be able to give you a general idea of how long their lines typically take for the ears to stand properly.|`|eDySIDPQaa	1---Cassie, your vet will tell you how long to keep them taped and how to care for the ears while doing the taping ,now each breeds ears are different, where one may not be taped as long as the next dog in the same breed......So, listen to your vet......and the dogs ears will be fine.<br>  <br>  2--some dogs in the Show World does not require cropping, however, till the standards are changed, there are breeds that the standard still calls for the ears to be cropped or the tail docked...<br>  <br>  follow the AKC regulations for your dog's standards....and yes nearly all the Judges do prefer the crop look, but again follow the standards for your breed and you will not be wrong......<br>  <br>  What one person is told to do with their dogs ears, may not apply to your dogs ears....so the best advice is to listen to your vet...and make sure if you do get them cropped, to get a vet that can do the proper show crop on your breed.....get references if necessary, but be careful who let do the dogs ears, you do not want them hacked up.....|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Hey Cassie!<br>  <br>  Once you start taping, continue taping until the puppy is done teething (6 months or so) even if ears appear to be standing well.<br>  <br>  Thats what my friend was told by her vet, she tapes her own Danes ears. <br>  <br>  PS:: In the Future i too am getting a Show Australian Shepherd! I might show Australian Shepherds eventually! Ohhh where both going in to the show world! How awesome! Keep me updated! Good luck!|`|KuUx34hCaa	your Vet will know I also know been told that cropping is forbidden in the U.K.|`|OwrycBfAaa	Hopefully this will better explain and answer your question. Though many breeds in show no longer require cropped ears it is unfortunate that most AKC judges frown on the appearance and these dogs generally do not do well in the ring as far as placing.<br>  Good luck. <br>  <a href="http://www.all-about-great-danes.com/great-dane-ear-cropping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.all-about-great-danes.com/gre...</a><br>  also to note, the term regarding tails is "docking". Cropping is the term referred to only the ears.|`|d6Ux1IHeaa	I think it's a barbaric practise and would discourage it at every opportunity. Mutilation of dogs was never something I agreed with and the recent ban on docking dogs tails - what ever their breed, is something I thoroughly applaud.
CCCWGJCHaa	you know the old saying you gotta walk before you can run? well...<br>  <br>  first, get your dog to walk WITH you: next to your side. the way we did this in raising Guide Dogs is to give a quick gentle pop on the leash whe they walk ahead of you. mind you, this is not a yank: just a gentle flick of your wrist. do not-i repeat DO NOT- use this method on a choke chain or a gentle leader/haltie.<br>   speaking of gentle leaders... My dog was a dominant puppy, and i had a heck of a time with him, so our group leader suggested a gentle leader. you can get them at petco. make sure you have one of the employees show you how to put it on correctly. the way the gentle leader works is instead of a pop on the leash, you gently guide their heads, kinda like you've got reins on your dog now! they are neither inhumane nor detrimental to the dog: if used properly the dog can pant, eat, and drink with the leader on. this makes it much easier to train your dog to walk with you. <br>  Once your dog can walk with you with the gentle leader, try with just a straight collar. once you master that, running should be just fine! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  Edit: Ilikesugar has got it right!<br>  Chuck... dogs can jog, trot and do just about anything you tell em to. my dog would jog with me to classes and on the track during practice. they dont have to full on sprint!|`|r8rykCkGaa	Only way is to take his leash off.  I know how this is.  Dogs will stop to sniff a lot, but if they see you are ahead of them, they will perk up and catch up with you.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Run faster. <br>  <br>  Just kidding. Being able to run with you dog starts with being able to walk with your dog. Any time your dog pulls on the lead just walking, stop him, walk him back and forth several times, and try again. Your dog will begin to understand the concept that if he pulls, he will get nowhere, and will stop pulling. (Teaching him to "halt," couldn't hurt either.) You can gradually increase pace from here.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	welll, at the petstore they have leaches that you can adjust, you can adjust wether you want them to have alot of string, or little string. <br>  my dog used to "lead" me, and she doesn't do it anymore. my advice is to get one of those (:|`|u4liwDhAaa	I am adding to what has already been said.  You have received a lot of good information.  It just takes time and practice with your dog.  You just need to work with him/her more.  In time it will come.  :+)|`|52otNiElaa	take off his leash.|`|W20KslFzaa	It's all a matter of training him.  My dog used to pull, and still sometimes does when I haven't taken him in a while.<br>  The more you run with him, the less exciting it gets and the more he'll call down.  <br>  Depending on the size and speed of your dog, however, it may be difficult for him to match your speed.  Dogs can walk, and run...they don't jog.  You may need to pick up your pace.|`|ek1193Qiaa	hold one of his favorite toys right behind you (but not in your pocket because he might bite your butt) so he will chase it but he wont go ahead of you because the toy is behind you. You can also have one of his favorite treats. That may even work better.|`|PniClUZtaa	roll the leash up into ur hand more<br>  or you can train her/him to walk beside you and then start running...eventually|`|4UotaSeiaa	well that tough you kinda have to run at their speed somy only advice is to run faster

They would be considered a medium dog, but they are very athletic and up for any challenge. I live with my 18 year old brother and we have people in and out of our house all day everyday  and we've never had a problem with aggression. They are also very friendly with other dogs, they have play dates with my friend's maltese all the time!

stCyrS4Eaa	How do you get giardiasis and how is it spread?<br>  The Giardia parasite lives in the intestine of infected humans or animals (e.g., cats, dogs, cattle, deer, and beavers).

You don't know what diseases the puppy has that you could expose your dogs to.|`|bIaywrBCaa	yes because if someone doesn't take thise pups they may end up at the shelter and probably be put to sleep.

My husband and I were at our local Wal Mart and there was a lady there with a box full of Australian shepherd puppies. I know my neighbor was looking for a similar type of dog so I called her.

Her reason was that the pups would end up in a pound if no one took them.|`|FpMGM0TRaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I have an "oops" cat. He is a wonderful friend!

Yes I've done this many times, since I know what would happen to these animals if I didn't. They'd be dumped in the of nowhere, shot, drowned, whatever. <br>  <br>  The dogs (sometimes cats too) are vetted, started in training, and found new homes. I've had a couple times where a dog lived with me for a year or more before going on to a home. Sometimes just because no one wanted them, or they had a behavior problem to work on. <br>  <br>  I've been unable to do this for the last couple years, and do miss it sometimes. Maybe when the kids are older I'll start again, but for now I'm working on donating my training talents to local shelters. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The thing people do have to remember though, is that there really isn't such a thing as a free pet. They still require vet care, training, good food etc. Sometimes those "free" pets can end up costing an arm and a leg just to get them healthy.|`|wkmdQnrSaa	yes, i have gotten 2 puppies, one of which i picked out and was really sick, so i took him to the vet, and very glad i did, he is a very good dog.  he is 2 now and my other one i got at 3 months old and not even paper trained.  she is now 5.  the male is a choc. lab/cocker spaniel mix and i picked him out because he was all alone in a corner, shaking, i knew this was the dog for my family.  he had gotten into some pig poo and antifreeze for tractors.  he was very sick and had to spend time in the vet hospital for this, when i got him back i had to give him shots and pills and confine him to a room that didnt have carpet because he had diareah.  so yeah i would bring home a free puppy, they are the best dogs i have ever had|`|XEqyrTTGaa	shhya! they are poor puppies who wil be under fed abused caged and imprisoned in the pound!! take them!

EQvAbyvcaa	Absolutely, this is normal.  It is a more prominent response in some breeds than others but it indicates extreme awareness.  My Amstaff and my German Shepherd both demostrate this in the extreme.  It is called "raising their hackles".  It will really get people's attention.|`|0m6BgESXaa	The scientific name for this is piloerection :-)  It's not always a sign of aggression, and in general is a sign of arousal.

He's got way too much 'gray' ... and a Visla (a dog from Africa) and he may have that hair that 'stands up' because part of his back and neck hair (under his regular coat) are growing backwards ... and if he is part Visla, this would explain it much better.  You can 'check' whether he has any Visla blood by gently brushing his back and neck hair up (when he's sleeping or completely relaxed) to see if the 'undercoat' isn't growing in the opposite direction to his other hair.  A Visla is usually very friendly, especially with smaller animals, because they are bred as 'herders' in Africa.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	it can be a sign of aggression but it can also just be a sign of excitment. one of my dogs hair will stand up when they first get to the dog park and she is all excited, then it goes down after she runs around for a bit.

He limps and cries when we pick him up and doesn't get too active for several days.  Two weeks ago he got his and last night I noticed he is still swollen where the shot was given to him.  We think they may have hit a muscle.
LFeEoHj3aa	That's awesome! I wish I could have a dog that sleeps with my kittens. I only have cats =(...anyway, you could try to make them smell the same. They may smell the same to you, but cats and dogs' noses are amazing. While they both probably stink to you, they smell unique in their own way. Some tricks to making them smell the same is, putting mint extract on the back of their necks, so they both smell that minty smell. It worked with my non related cats and now their best friends...and husband and wife, considering he got her pregnant! hehe...(don't lecture me please, I know about unwanted kittens, this was a surprise and I had an appointment scheduled but she wanted to make my life crazier...) ANYWAY...don't give one more attention than the other. Play equally. It's weird that the dog is getting bullied by the kitten, haha. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|cea6040e71e8f154dbc8b9c8e3bc2ce3aa	Sounds like you have it under control. It seems like your dog is a little cautious of the kitten, I call any small animals or children "babies" to my dogs & they know that they must be gentle to them. They have learned that "babies" cause no harm to them & in return the dogs will cause no harm to the "babies". It works perfect.|`|HkMhWvtgaa	Awww!  What a pair of cuties!<br>  <br>  I can understand why you want them to get along; it sure makes for a more peaceful household.  But I think you'll be more satisfied with your results if you shift your goal from "helping them become best friends" to "setting appropriate limits on inappropriate behavior."<br>  <br>  After all, you don't want someone to pick your friends for you, do you?  Allow your pets the dignity of choosing their own friends, too.  If they choose one another as friends, GREAT!  If not, try to accept it, and be content with orderly behavior.<br>  <br>  It sounds as if you are already on the right track.  I'm sure that giving them treats when they are together helps!  Don't forget about non-edible kinds of positive reinforcement, too, such as praise and petting.  As soon as they see that they both get more attention from you, not less, because of one another, they will adapt to the situation.<br>  <br>  Also, be prepared to respond to anything negative.   A good negative reinforcer for cats is a short but loud blow on a whistle.  If the kitten learns that clawing the dog will cause such a loud noise, then he probably won't claw the dog very often.  As the kitten becomes less aggressive, the dog will become more comfortable being around him.  (The reverse is true, too, but right now, it sounds like the kitten is the aggressor.  He probably feels like he has to be, because the dog is so much bigger.)<br>  <br>  As far as the hissing is concerned, I would suggest ignoring it.  It's the kitten's own way of communicating the limits on his "comfort zone", and the dog is actually doing a good job of listening.  In other words, it's actually a good thing the dog is afraid of being hissed at.  As the dog learns how close the kitten is comfortable having him, the kitten will feel less threatened and will hiss less often.  Also, as you become more accustomed to thinking of the hissing as a vital form of communication between your pets, it will bother you less.|`|AA11780840	That is so cute.. Just let them be. Your dog and cat will be best friends. Your dog won't hurt or eat the kitten.. No worries! He is being protective. Just give them time. <br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your kids...
KxjUim7yaa	Most dogs you can tell when they are in heat. There is also "silent" heat where there is no noticeable sign, but the female is in heat and can be bred and produce puppies. (that is why you have to watch them)|`|chdtVwhFaa	Not always.  My female went through a silent heat which I had never heard of.  Dogs usually go into season around 6 months of age, if you haven't noticed anything yet, she probably has had this silent heat cycle.|`|145RUNQHaa	You would know her privates would swell up quite a lot there would be droplets of blood my dog only had one season i found it such an inconvenience i got her to the vets to be fixed soon after.|`|qioH81tiaa	There is something called a "silent" heat.  If you cannot tell when she is in heat, as a responsible PET owner, you would have to keep her contained at all times to prevent an accidental litter.  Isn't spaying easier??|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	*I* will know, but many pet owners are incredibly unobservant.
AA10327148	I have raised Afghan hounds since 1983.<br>  I was first attracted to them when I took a cousin to look at a litter. (the cousin had a very old one, and was ready to get another, to ease the passing of the oldster)I saw the 13 week old puppies standing patiently while three children were grooming them. One came over and put his head on my lap, looking up at me. .<br>  I didn't really know much about them, other than what I had seen of my 'cousin's'. I had been a dog world professional since 1968, and was familiar with the breed standard of this breed. I went home and contacted some breeders about the pedigree of this pup, and eventually took a long-time breeder to look at the litter.(He became my very helpful mentor)  He was impressed with the litter, and especially the one that had put his head in my lap at the first meeting.<br>  Well, I took that one home.<br>  He became the foundation of my lineage. <br>  He was an ideal foundation, as his line has produced true to breed standard and hounds that are a pleasure to live with.<br>  Some will claim that the Afghan is stupid or hard to train. That is only because they haven't learned to 'speak the language'. Training an Afghan, using most conventional methods, is just like trying to push a chain uphill. <br>  However, once you now how to *communicate*, they are very pliable and easy to train.. Nothing compares to the dignity of these guys.  Once they know something is wrong, they don't do it again. <br>  All of my pups have been housetrained and well mannered by the time they leave my home at 13 to 16 weeks. <br>  These hounds are amazing.<br>  However, they require a LOT of work and dedication. It takes a certain personality to 'meld' with this breed. They are not the breed for everybody.|`|IYXmB40laa	I haven't had any problems with my afghan hound.|`|XrElWo8haa	Hi <br>  I have had the pleasure of being owned by this beautiful elegant breed for the past 25 years and I have 12 of them!! If you are seriously thinking of buying an Afghan puppy it would be best to contact the American Kennel Club who will be able to put you in contact with breed clubs and also reputable breeders who might have puppies for sale and will be able to offer further advice. Of course there are always rescue Affies looking for new homes and owning one of these as a companion can be very rewarding. Being site hounds this breed is not for the faint hearted and most owners never let the dogs off the lead because if they decide to go boy can they go and you have to be very fit to catch one!! There is also the show scene, lure coursing and of course obedience although the Afghan Hound is a very independant creature, much the same temprement as a Siamese cat. Coat of course is another bone of contention but if you lack time and commitment it's always best to clipper them short for their own comfort. The show coat takes a lot of commitment, time and effort, the average show coat prep time 4 hours but some are 6+ but nothing looks nicer than a beautiful Afghan Hound, hair flowing striding towards you with that effortless ground - covering movement - pure poetry. Good luck in your search but there are lots of forums and groups out there only willing to offer advice.

bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	It really depends on the decibel level, and how often you're exposed, but yes they can be.
3O6CTb3saa	wow that's a hard one, and u must feel so bad.  You need to look at several things first what is her quality of life with just the medicine does she still limp and act like she hurts?  Talk with the vet about the procedure of the surgery how dangerous it is or not and all about it so you will know more on that part.  Ask the vet how long will she able to function on just the medicine?  I think if you know all your options you will feel better at making a decision.  If you can afford the surgery and it makes her life better why not?  No surgery is ever guaranteed a hundred percent not even humans.  So check all your options and learn as much as u can about the problem and go from there.  Good Luck!|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	It is your decision.  if the medicine is expensive, you should get the surgery because it might save you money in the long run :)|`|jlIiv0jTaa	Yes get the sergery if you dont want a usless dog for the rest of her life because it will go back in place and then just let her rest for a while and give her the medicine and within about 1 month or 2 or less she will be back in tip top condition.
5LjYxh8Jaa	I wholeheartedly agree with the law.  Too bad it's only in Minnesota !!  It needs to be a nationwide law !|`|26PPwzrWaa	I agree. <br>  I think it should always be that way. Thats how they are with humans, its not guilty until proven, why should it be any different with a dog. <br>  <br>  On a side note: <br>  Would you mind letting me know where you got that information. <br>  I am doing a speech on BSL and would love to use that as a solution part of my paper.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|14b8d6b25a350fc05dceefa9b229f6cfaa	Yes!  They need to punish people who own dogs that actually ARE dangerous, no matter what the dog's breed.  This is such a better law than just banning one breed.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I agree.  I wish the entire world would get behind something like this.<br>  <br>  The only thing I would change about it is, perhaps neutering the owners as well ... :P|`|98p5v51zaa	YES!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I haven't seen the acutal law, but from your description I find it good.<br>  <br>  People who own dangerous dogs - of ANY breed - need to be held accountable.<br>  <br>  Discriminating against dogs due to what they look like is just idiotic.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Absolutely! I like that they will not allow owners convicted of violating the law to own dogs again. That shows they have recognized it is the OWNER not the breed of dog that makes the big difference. The only problem I see with that part is what if someone adopted a dog that turned out to be aggressive? I mean, if they've only had the dog a couple weeks to months, but the previous owners had 2-5 years to do the "damage" should the adopters really be held responsible for the dog being dangerous?  They should be held responsible for any incidents stemming from improper containment and such (assuming they had the dog long enough (more than a couple days) to know about/suspect problems), but they shouldn't be punished as though they caused the original problem. It does happen, in fact, I have found myself in such a situation.

fGwZMglGaa	Dwarf hamsters can be tempremental. They are a bit unprodictable and you can't guarentee they will be friendly. Of course this is the case for all animals but you really can't tell with dwarfs because they are so unprodictable. They are faster, therefore more difficult to handle. Syrians are generally friendly and don't bite unless they smell food on your hand or you are hurting them. I would reccomend a boy because they are in general more friendly all the girls I know except mine bite and cannot be handled. I meant to get a boy and thought i did but they accidently gave me a girl but I am very lucky she is a friendly one!<br>  Hamsters make great pets and I reccomend a syrian one. However, if you do get a chinese one a name could be chopsticks, cause it is a cool name!<br>  Good luck with your hammie, mine is pregnant and gonna have babies soon yay!|`|BWez86Ldaa	Make sure to do tons of research on each. There are good and bad points to each. Syrians are, typically, friendlier than dwarf hamsters, so my favorites are the dwarfs. :) I like nit-picky, moody pets, they are way more interesting to me than pets who simply love to cuddle.|`|wsLngQ8oaa	Well if you're a first time owner I'd go with a syrian or teddy bear, and I would get a male. Females can be very moody and males are more laid back. Also if you're a first time owner I'll let you know something I wish some one told me when I got my first hamster. Where you get it definitely matters. I tend to lean more to independently owned pet stores as opposed to big ones like pets unlimited. the reason being, in smaller stores  they need to give GREAT service to compete with larger stores. So pets cages tend to be cleaner, they tend to have males and females separated, they handle pets, and have more knowledge. For example when I got my first hamster, I asked for a male, they gave me a female, from a cage that was half open and reeked!!! She'd never been held before, so she was ill tempered. The second hamster I got was a boy and was in a cage with ONLY his brother. The cage was spotless, and he was already used to being handled when I got him. Hope my little rant wasn't a total pain, and was actually a big help :)|`|UJO8EUPGaa	I find dwarf hamsters are harder to train <br>  and are very good escape artists, and they are not easy to hold<br>  because they are so tiny.<br>  Get a Syrian one but remember to does lots of research before getting it!|`|4eUext7Xaa	I had a dwarf hamster (not sure if it was chinese). I did not like him!! He bit me and he smelled REALLY bad. Even after I cleaned his cage. I would go for Syrian.|`|AA11441825	I have owned both before, I found that the Chinese were able to be taught small tricks and commands and were way more tame. I was bit by several different Syrian ones. Most small animals in general though will attack if cornered or they don't feel good. do your homework. get a hamster book or talk to someone who knows a lot about them. and if you get a girl one make sure its not pregnant. lol happened to me. she had 6 babies. what a handful. hope this helps. P.S. you can give them baths, just a little water in the sink and some mild soap, don't get it in their ears though, and dry them in a warm towel. we did that with all ours. really helps with the stinky smell. you have to keep up on changing the bedding. and my cousin had a Syrian and it was allergic to cedar so she used pine.|`|10eguzBCaa	get a syrian hamster so friendly mine has just passed away he was 3 years old
EUsIDbHsaa	Well, if you actually study the origin of pit bulls people would know that they were bred for aggression, but ONLY towards other dogs.  They were bred to fight other dogs, but their owners could also reach into the middle of the fight without any concern of being bit.  They knew not to bite a human.  But our society has slowly abused their aggressive nature.  It is so horribly sad.  They are innocent animals that have been turned into something they are not!  They are amazingly sweet dogs, when raised correctly.  We have two in my family and they could not be bigger babies.  We do not let them around the children in our family, because we cannot be sure of what happened in their blood line.  If the great grandfather was bred for aggression, then it is in their blood.  So we simply take that precaution.  But they are great dogs that are put into very sad situations.  Hope this gives you the information you need!|`|4wdmOLxBaa	I have a pitbull and can tell you shes a really sweet dog when it comes to people. However, she's not vicious, but she doesn't get along very well with other dogs. I've seen her stare them down and stuff like that. Also she has kind of an anxiety about being alone, and I know friends of mine with pitbulls have had the same problem. But she LOVES people, and is extremely friendly. Never had a real problem.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I love mine! Human aggression was carefully bred out of them for centuries it is only with the rapid increase in irresponsible breeders that we are seeing an increase in human aggression ... and even that requires a lot of bad breeding and a lot of mistreatment to overcome centuries of careful breeding.|`|WOU4u2y1aa	i hate pit bulls i live in Indiana in the us and a lady got attacked by one not long ago the lady got her legs amputated and the dogs dragged her to the front lawn and there are blood stains to there is one that lives in my neiborhood and freaks me out the owners lets it loose all the time and it wonders around weve almost called animal control a couple times :(|`|gbR74o7vaa	I believe pit bulls get a bad rep. I don't own one myself however a lot of my neighbors do. They are all very loving and I don't know anyone who has had a problem with them other then what I hear on the news. No matter what they breed is there is always a chance of an attack. People need to understand this. It all depends on how they are brought up. People need to understand how a dog thinks and how to handle them.<br>  <br>  Approximately 50 infants die each year from broken baby cribs, and 250 newborns die at the hands of their parents or guardians. In comparison, two infants, on average, die a year from dog attacks. A child in the United States is over 100 times more likely to be killed by his or her parent or caretaker than by a dog." <br>  <br>  <br>  Want more information about pit bulls click the link below.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Bad dogs are made not born. My friend had a pit bull and it was very friendly. They are very strong however, and if trained to kill they will do so. We used to pull down a tree branch and the dog would latch himself on by his jaw and swing.
D1beU6MPaa	This is typical behavior for the Boxer breed. They are the clowns of the canine world. Can't walk straight to save their lives. They twist and turn, and run and play. They need lots of exercise, and this is his way of getting it. Boxer's are notorious for running through the house, yard, or wherever. They are very active, and playful. So I really don't think there is anything you need to do except take him for walks, and play with him.

FDm7feRoaa	Well if you breed rats youmust have 2 cages... Simply because after the female gives birth she tends tot he babies 24/7 aftera while the male wants to have sex again (it's pleasure for them as well of course) and to do so he kills the babies (Eats them most of the time) so that she will be willing again... So you'll have to keep him separate....<br>  <br>  Depending on how much your snake eats you'll want to think about keeping the female babies away from the male babies cus they will breed as well... And if your snake don't eat alot you willbe stuck with somany rats it'll stink and you'll have to change the bedding almost everyday so forth so forth...<br>  <br>  I know your just going to feed the rats to your snake.. but what goes into the rat goes into your snake... So you'll have to feed the rats the best fattening foods healthy foods they eat 1/3 there body weight a day... But you don't want to feed the rat a lot of crap then feed it to your snake cus thats just gonna be bad for your snake! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped I have a pet rat his name is templetin smartest pet I own~ He uses the kitty litter does tricks walks on a leash and eats anything i want to throw away so it don't got to waist! All I did was look up how to teach rats and tought him! try it it's awesome!|`|AA12032374	go to a pet store and ask for the information. They would be the most knowledgeable.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	You really think feeder rats wouldn't be sold just because it's cruel? Without a doubt, it is cruel. How can you say that creating life only to force it to die painfully in the freezer, be bludgeoned against the table or poisoned by a snake? I mean, come on, use your senses. You can't deny it's cruel, simple as that. Now, that doesn't mean that it isn't necessary. Snakes DO have to eat, too.<br>  <br>  However, I do hope you will treat these rats humanely. Give them lives of cuddling and comfort before their demise. <br>  <br>  How do you plan to kill these poor rats before feeding? You do realize that F&T (freeze and thaw) is a much wiser choice than live feeding, right? I've even personally known snakes who were killed by their "food." There are few snakes that can't be transitioned to F&T. (And no, by F&T I do not suggest you just stick the rats in the freezer. That's anything but humane.)<br>  <br>  ..anyway. Why don't you join one of the many herp forums floating around? I'm sure fellow snake owners can give you great info on relatively kind feeder breeding.<br>  <br>  No, it isn't as simple as sticking rats in the same cage. Females come into estrus every five days. At this point, breeding can take literally three seconds. However, while rats are social creatures, it isn't a wise idea to just drop them in the same cage together. It's perfectly possible that one or both will seriously squabble. Pregnancy should last 23-25 days, and any number of serious complications are completely possible. Remove the male once the breeding takes place; the female can be impregnated pretty much right after birth, which will be extremely detrimental to both the female and her bubs. (I'm sure you realize that pregnancy takes a huge toll on a female's body. Back-to-back pregnancies are too hard on animals, and they can't properly care for and nurse the babies.)<br>  <br>  And no, a tank isn't okay. Rats have highly delicate respiratory systems, and tanks provide next to no ventilation for the ammonia fumes from urine. You're gonna have a lot of poor, sick rats. But I guess that doesn't matter to you, eh?|`|qGBklnngaa	ur gonna make rats for snake food? Thats kinda crrepy, but it guess it would be cheaper tha buying them...|`|BWez86Ldaa	My advice is: Don't breed. As a snake AND rat owner, I would never suggest to anyone that, first of all, they feed their snakes live mice/rats. This is because there are many things that could go wrong, both with the rat and snake. There are multiple ways that your snakes could be injured (youtube some snake injuries by rats, or just look them up on yahoo). Also, feeding live is extremely cruel. Would you be able to bite the head off of a chicken or cow and just eat it? Ew.<br>  <br>  If you are going to do this, make sure you do it right, at least. Glass tanks cause ammonia build-up and cause lots of health problems for rats, because of this you will not want to be breeding rats in poor conditions, especially if they are being raised for food. I know you wouldn't want to feed your snake a sick rat just as much you wouldn't want to eat a sick cow, right? Rats do best in open-air cages such as the critter nation or martin's cages for rats. <br>  <br>  If you will be breeding rats there are many things you will need to research. For healthy feeder rats, you will need a good diet, no premixed rat food from the pet store will be adequate. For these rats to be adequate food for your snake, they will need proper care and diet, just as much as pet rats. If you want your rats not to bite you every time you stick your hand in their cage, you will need to "play" with them and allow them out-of-cage time as well. <br>  <br>  Long-term this will save you money (maybe ten years or so), but in the long run, it is safer and easier to buy frozen and serve thawed. Whatever you decide, please keep in mind that you want your snakes to have proper nutrition, thus the rats you decide to breed to be in healthy and good condition.|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	I am a rat owner and rat lover. I understand you are a snake lover, and that it is necessary for snakes to eat. I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful at all in this reply. It makes me very upset when I hear or see people feeding their animals live rodents. Some people argue that their snake will not take a frozen/thawed rat. That may be a reasonable answer, especially if the snake owner has tried several times over a long period of time to convert his snake. And some, unfortunately, think it's "cool" to watch a snake attack and kill a mouse, rat, or bunny. Have you ever tried to feed your snake f/t rats? A lot of people think you just toss in a thawed rat and expect the snake to eat it, and claim it won't eat f/t and stick with live. The rat would need to be prepared in a way to simulate a live rat. If you want, I could try to find information for you about f/t feeding. Are you also aware that a rat can easily kill the snake if the snake is not hungry or will not take the snake? Some uneducated snake owners will just toss a rat into the enclosure and leave it there until the snake eats it. They may not be aware that the snake is not hungry or that the snake is possibly starting to shed, which is why it doesn't eat, and get upset when they come back and find the rat has either injured or killed the snake. In this sense, live feeding can be very dangerous and potentially fatal to your snake and I personally don't recommend it. I understand your want to save money by breeding your own rats, and if it were anything else (say, makig your own clothes instead of buying them because clothes are too expensive), then I would definetly help you. But you must realize that rats are intelligent creatures and should not be treated like a cash crop just to die a slow agonizing death in the grip of a snake.<br>  <br>  My views aside, you should not keep your rats in a tank. You will likely end up with a dead rat before you can get it to your snake. Tanks provide poor ventilation and the amonia build up can give the rat a respiratory infection or pneumonia, which if left untreated could kill the rat. If you want to properly care for rats, you should have a wire cage, paper based or aspen bedding (never pine or cedar), and lab block food. Seed mixes are very bad for any rat and could make the rat fat, which isn't healthy for the snake. You should also not breed the females excessively. A female should never be constantly pregnant. It would wear her body out and she would not be able to care for the babies properly, which could result in sick or dead babies. I can't remember if the recommended number of litters is three per year or three per lifetime. If you breed more often, the female will become overbred and produce unhealthy babies. This means you should keep the males and females seperated until you want a new litter. You could easily become overrun with rats if you keep the males and females together their entire lives. Also, a female should never breed under 4 months of age. She is typically not fullgrown until then, and a pregnancy could kill her or again produce sick or dead babies. The mothers only while nursing, can be kept in a tank, but the litter muct be changed daily. The babies would be too small to be able to stay in most wire cages. Once the babies reach 5 weeks, they should be seperated and put in wire cages. At 6 weeks, the babies become sexually active. Use a water bottle instead of a dish, as a dish could easily become dirty and host bacteria that could make the rats sick.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	if you get a male, and a female together.. they WILL make babys, weather she wants too or not. Mine had like, 6-8 per litter,  take the dad out though.. he will eat them.

KvUJZa1Paa	I have read all of your other questions. And yes I do agree with all of the answers you have already gotten.<br>  But tell me one thing have you ever had to put a female down to save a puppy. 3 yrs ago i had to have one of my females put down because a puppy was stuck in birth canal. Vet couldn't get it to move back in and couldn't get it to come out. This dog wasn't only a investment for me but was a friend. <br>  In case you don't know it my dogs are show dogs, valued up to $4,500.00, a person like you could never afford to own this dog., and I had to make the decision to put her down to save the puppies.<br>  <br>  Do you want something like this to happen to your dog. No. I didn't think so. It can and It has. Do her a favor and yourself get her spayed and stop this nonsense of wanting to be a breeder just cause she is cute.<br>  <br>  Breeding dog is a ex pence and we as the owners and the smart ones don't always make the right moves.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Mom will teach them to back off when they bite too much.

There is a lot to know and consider BEFORE you breed any dog.  Some people think that because they love their dog that is reasson enough to breed her.  I'm not goin to throw stones at you for making a mistake.<br>  <br>  At five weeks--they are old enough to wean.<br>  <br>  Once their teeth are in they can eat soft food.  Start with canned puppy food--Pedigree lamb & Rice is good.  Use a little milk to soften it some.  Put down some newpaper because they will be messy for the first few weeks.<br>  <br>  Once the puppies begin to eat solid food--momma will stop cleaning them--so get some baby wipes and do potty patrol in their box to pick up and remove poops. <br>  <br>   I like to use cedar chips in my puppy box  and a little box scoop to clean up poop piles.  When the chips get wet or dirty--change them.  With just a few pug puppies about every 3rd day should be Ok if you keep the box cleaned up on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Take some dry Puppy food and add some warm water and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to soften some--and feed that to them.  Puppies at this age (5 weeks) need to be feed 4-6 times a day! Try not to feed after 8-900pm at night--that way they will be less pooping at night!<br>  <br>  Take them outside right after you feed them--or feed them out side.  Most will poop right after they eat.   Keep lots of clean water for them to drink and change it often.  <br>  <br>  Once they get the ideal of how to eat soft food--you can place some dry food in their bowel for the to eat "on Demand".  Puppies need a lot of calories, so please make sure you feed them enough and frequently.<br>  <br>  If you haven't wormed them yet--please do ASAP.  They should be wormed at least every 2 weeks at present.  You should also get their first shots at 7-8 weeks.  No puppy should leave your home until it is at least 8 weeks old and has had a Vet exam and is in good health.<br>  <br>  Raising and breeding dogs is a lot of hard work--and not something to be done without a lot of planning and preparation.  It's not a job for Sissies! You have been lucky--you girl has been a good momma and your puppies have been healthy.<br>  <br>    Please educate yourself more about this process so that you can do the best posssible job in the future for your girl.  Hopefully, you understanding how hard this process can be on you and Lily.  Spay her and love her.  That's really all she wants..

0m6BgESXaa	x.x  Not a single person has given decent advice...<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is start with the garage door shut (if you're letting her out through the garage), keep her on a leash and collar and have her sit.<br>  <br>  SLOWLY open the door, and the moment she starts to get up you close that door and go "No, sit!"  You needn't be physically harsh with her.  The leash is to prevent her escaping, not to physically correct her.<br>  <br>  As you work on this, when she remains sitting, you tell her "Yayyy! Good girl!" Give her a cookie and then give her a release word (something like "Outside!") take her outside on lead and have her sit again.<br>  <br>  You're teaching her that she must first WAIT for you to tell her to go outside and then once she's outside she must sit and wait for you on the porch.<br>  <br>  You must also be able to (eventually) tell her to wait, step outside the door FIRST with it standing wide open (with her on lead) and turn around and face her without her breaking.<br>  <br>  This can take weeks and weeks worth of training, and you MUST be absolutely consistent.<br>  <br>  Work on your recall as well.  Use something EXTREMELY high value to the dog, such as a tug toy.  When she runs away start calling in an extremely high pitched voice "Puppy puppy puppy!!! Come this way!" and RUN in the other direction.  Prey drive tends to kick in and the dog will chase you.<br>  <br>  When she gets within range, slowly kneel down and say "Good girl!  Come!" Do not suddenly grab at her, just calmly reach out and take her by the collar, and reward her heavily for coming to you!|`|7GvCw1Mhaa	i neeed pointtttts|`|AM7CgQ4daa	wildfyre's answer is excellent, I just wanted to point out that when a dog pushes past its owner, it is actually rude dominant behaviour.  A respectful dog stands back and lets the owner walk through first, no pushing allowed, so you may also want to consider how you treat your dog, and start to demand better behaviour in general.  The dog not coming when called is also not a good sign.<br>  Make sure you behave in an alpha way, make sure your dog understands your the boss, not a playmate.

Just make sure he can not reach it because he will probably chew it or something.|`|BWez86Ldaa	This is why I love rodents! They're so... picky then want to go and mess things up! I suggest getting a shallow ceramic bowl. You can find these at your local pet store or even at Wal-Mart or Target.

Good luck!|`|wsLngQ8oaa	best bet is to get an un-tippable dish and forget the one he's tipping over.

D51c2be6aa	Hi, I found myself in similar circumstancies  in January, my 7 year old Leonberger, presented  with heavy breathing, and coughing, I took her to the vets immediately, to be told that after examination, she had Kennel Cough, I was given antibiotics and sent away pronto!!<br>  4 days later I took her back, because she still had the same symptoms plus water retention. This time she was correctly diagnosed with Congestive Heart  Failure.  I was so angry at the previous vets diagnosis, especially as he had listened to her heart and found it to be fine! <br>   My dog was kept overnight, she was xrayed drained of fluid and started on a regime of meds to help her heart and keep the fluid at bay.<br>  Its worked fine for a few weeks, but i'm back to square one now.<br>  These few extra weeks have given me time to reflect, and well, what i want to say is, Congestive Heart Failure is final.The meds your vet prescribed will buy you a little extra time with your Pug ( sorry I don't know his name), I dare say that the injection your dog was given was correct, and the oxygen would help with his breathingand his heart. Just make the most of your time together.You've given 14 years to a very special friendship. and the memories go on forever.<br>   A word to the wise though, if i have learned anything from this it's to only ever see a senior vet, regardless of your pets illness.<br>  best Wishes..............H.<br>  <br>  <br>  I|`|J5hsCONRaa	No disrespect but why are you questioning the care your vet can give your dog? If you dont trust them, why did you bother going to them for treatment? Unless you are a Vet yourself, how can you determine whether they gave the right treatment?<br>  Seems to me you are already looking for "compensation" before anything has happened......which is typical of society today.<br>  <br>  I hope your Pug does just fine and reinstate some faith in your Vets ability.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	the vet knows what he /she is doing they went to school of this meds don't always work right away im sure they are taking real good care of the dog. it could always be something different dogs cant speak and tell us what is wrong we have to figure it out by ourselves you have to be calm and just trust they know what they are doing|`|UOmJbxkOaa	I think you should call to check on him also what i think is that maybe he is a little dehydrated also if the vet wont help you call a specialist they could probably help.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Without sounding too "nasty". Please bear in mind your dog is 14. <br>  Best of luck.<br>  Late Entry : and little shyt fairied dare to thumb down even this. You morons are so pathetic :)|`|DJbxsLIVaa	Lasix is the appropriate treatment for what sounds like Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in your dog.  But make sure to specifically ask the vet what the diagnosis is.  Call the vet back and ask him/her direct questions about your dog's prognosis.  1. Will he need to be on meds for the rest of his life?  2. What will the quality of life be like for him?  3.  Will he still get to enjoy X,Y, Z while living with this condition?  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are upset because your dog was taken away from you and you don't know when he will get to come home.  Kindly ask the vet staff when you can come visit him.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	You can call another vet and ask him to review the case.  You may have to pay a consultation fee, but it will be worth it for peace of mind.  <br>  <br>  If you think they gave the wrong drug, drive back over there and ask them to draw a vial of blood in front of you and bring it to the other vet.  They may be able to run a blood panel, or send it out, to see what's in his blood and what happened.  It's going to be pricey, fair warning.  <br>  <br>  At 14, he's getting up there and it sounds like he may have a lung problem or Congestive Heart Failure.  The Lasix may not have aggrevated the problem, but rather showed that it wasn't what they originally thought (Like CHF vs. Lung Cancer).  But, I'm not a vet or a Pug specialist, and I haven't examined him.  <br>  <br>  I really hope that your little puglet does ok.  Happy Thoughts to you.  : )|`|9kTejB0uaa	If at any time your are not happy with what a vet is doing, you are entitled to take a second opinion.  You pay the bills, you call the shots.  However, as others have said, in fairness to the vet who is treating your elderly dog, they cannot work miracles.  Your dog has lived to be a good age already, and it may just be that he has reached the end of his days.  Sadly they just don't live long enough.  <br>  <br>  I hope the results you get in the morning give you just a bit more time with your old boy.  But don't forget, quality of life is what you have to put first, before your own emotions.|`|Bw18seFqaa	With all respect.. your dog is 14 years old.<br>  <br>  You probably also should have brought him to the vet when you first noticed the dog was ill..   you said he had been ill for a few days, yet waited to rush him to the vet when he fell over.<br>  <br>  Your vet will do the best he can, but you may have waited too long to bring the dog in for treatment.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	You could try to contact another vet and see how they would have addressed the situation. Also you can call and check on your dog anytime you want. <br>  <br>  I trust my vet (actually knew him before he became a vet and he is great), but there is a vet that shares the office with him and she is a witch, doesn't like dogs at all so when she gets them she has a fit and has been reported many times. I refuse to go to her, will take my dog to a 24/7 vet before. But anyways I have reported her to the vet board as others I know have as well. If you feel that your vet did something wrong, you can report them as well.<br>  <br>  I think your just missing your dog and are worried about him your vet will try and do the best they can.|`|KxjUim7yaa	The vet can tell by listening to the lungs if there is fluid there. Lasix is the same treatment they give people with this problem. Due to age, your Pug has gotten CHF a condition most older animals get. It is Congestive Heart Failure. It involves the lungs and heart and the lack of oxygen going to the heart muscle. Your Pug actually has done very well to get to this age.Removing the fluid from the lungs helps both lungs and heart to work better. Having additional oxygen until the dog is stable is what is needed. The vet is trying to prevent a heart attach. This again is the way they treat people. I see no fault with their treatment .I hope for a joyful homecoming. At some point you must consider your pet will pass on, she has had a full life.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Okay, take a breath.  You're getting way ahead of things.  I realize you're upset about your dog, but he is quite elderly and there could be any number of things of combination of things going on.  Call so that you can get updates of how your dog is doing at the vets.  Then, which ever way it goes (I'm hoping that he makes it), talk to your vet about what happened with the dog.  Try to have some specific questions ready for the vet and be sure you get a diagnosis.  Then, if you still feel that the vet doesn't have your dog's best interests at heart, go to another vet.  I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for your old guy.

uXAV4wP0aa	We rescued our hound, Maggie. The shelter said they had no idea what happened to her only that her previous family beat her and abandoned her somewhere in rural Wyoming. THEN some kids shot her up with a bb gun! When the shelter finally got her, they removed the bb's. When we adopted her, we found another one and got it removed too. <br>  <br>  Maggie is very sensitive to people now. If I get angry over anything at all (not even at her), she starts shaking and runs off. If I holler at my husband across the house (not even angrily), she runs to me with her eyes big and she's shaking. If I reach out too fast, she cowers and acts like I'm going to hit her. She's gotten a lot better since we've had her though. She used to be afraid of everything! Now just certain things. lol. <br>  <br>  She's not gun-shy though. Which is odd.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	that is awful. :( i have come across it, i have a cat called chloe who i got off a friend of a friend. he used to wrestle her, swung her by her tail and i think he broke it, it has a funny kink in it, and she pooed in her carry basket so he super soaked her. :( she jumped out of a window twice to escape him. when we got her she never came out for about 2 months, we just left her to it because we didn't want to rush her, and eventually she started to come out. we've had her for about 18 months and she's still very shy and will not come out when new people are around, sometimes not when its just us. when she does come over for a stroke she backs off when you try to. he even had the cheek to ask for her back because he missed her. poor chloe. she now lives with my other cats muji and mowgli. and doesn't have to worry about people like him anymore.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	My SIL's ex was very abusive to her and her dog Ozzy.

If you are looking for a cheap dog, i suggest you go to a rescue or spca and look for a small breed dog.  No dogs are cheap, they all come with responsibilities and a long bill on shots, food, toys, cleaning, and any unexpected suprises such as injuries and special meds.  If you do not have the money i suggest you do not get a dog right now, the economy right now is not the best to bring a dog into ur home and later to abandon it at a shelter because the bills were too much.|`|N7NdDtpHaa	Ugh.

0HNjbW7gaa	Get which ever gender you feel comfortable with. I currently own two dogs a 11 y.o. Chow mix (MALE) and a 3 y.o. Springer Spaniel (MALE) and I have never had a problem with dominance by either dog. Of course they are both neutered, which helps a lot. So, get the dog you want, not the dog you "think" you should get. As for introductions, take your dog down the street (maybe a park) and walk him so he is good and tired, when you feel he is tired enough, have another person bring the new addition to the park, don't get overly enthused. Take the "newbie" and let your dog smell the rear of the newbie. Once you have then that and your dog is okay, start walking both dogs home. Before you know it, both dogs will be good and tired and won't bother "claiming" the house as theirs. I wouldn't give the Yorkie the run of the house, crate train the Yorkie, and monitor both dogs when the Yorkie is out and about. Eventually if the "human" has done the job right both dogs will be able to co-exist.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Female is usually better, but some same sex matches work if they are both fixed. Fix the male and fix the female. Don't leave them alone until you are sure they are getting along. Don't make a big fuss over the Yorkie. The other dog can get jealous.|`|UlEk0eggaa	If you get a female dog your male dog will get your female if you know what i mean|`|AA11438718	Get a female puppy because two males will likely fight each other for dominance.  But make sure they're she's spayed and he's neutered.  Its' a good idea to let the new dog have the run of the house for a few days while your current dog is kept in a separate space.  Make sure you're there when you let your current dog  back in.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	It really doesn't matter.  Look at sled dogs.  They are mostly male.  Neuter them both.

If not, then why don't breeders put this in there sale contracts?|`|EihCVyg4aa	damn  skippy you should breed that dog|`|KxjUim7yaa	Their reasoning is that they are going to get back the money, maybe even make a profit by selling the puppies.

My Schnoodle(save your breath everyone, he's from a rescue) has bad breath, and this morning I saw blood in his stool, so I brought it by the vet, and it turns out he has a stomach infection.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Hi Nicole,<br>  I can get so worked up over the very issue that you are bringing up.  Most of what I do is work 1/4 with the dogs and 3/4 with the owner.  I had 2 very aggressive larger breeds to "retrain" it took about 2 days.  I spent the rest of the week working with the family.  I think because discipline is almost looked at as abuse is why we have whaling children in grocery stores, teenagers that seem so isolated, and dogs running a muck.  I love all of my children dearly...so I dared to discipline.  If I was angry they went to a time out and so did I.  Then we dealt with issues with a cool head but also with the knowledge that guidelines are good.  It's not different for a pup/dog.  They need to know what proper dog educate is...they need to be allowed to be who God created them to be ( not human ) but when they are living in a humans house  etc... guidelines are necessary.  Even in the "dog world" there is a pecking order and someone is always in charge.  I believe it takes a lot more love to say "no" than it does to ignore and tolerate.  I believe with dogs as well as human we need harmony....peace.  That is only accomplished through routine...knowing what is expected.  I have worked with a woman off and on for over 2 years about this.  She e-mailed me yesterday and said "I am finally doing what you said.  And you know for the first time since my dogs were pups I am glad to come home and be greeted by them.  They no longer fight for who gets to say "Hi" first.  They don't fight by the food dish, they actually all eat together (she has 3).  I started doing some of the same things with my kids and it's working.  Even they say that I'm not so mad anymore".  <br>  I don't know how old you are but I think you will one day, if you aren't already, make a wonderful mom.  I always tell my kids (all grown now) that I practiced on my dogs...they taught me and still teach me a lot about life, about others, even about myself.  <br>  Well...sorry for rambling...I just am so thankful that you see what I try so very hard to teach every day of my life.  I wish you a long life of happiness Nicole.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Well, geez give yourself a pat on the back.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Me too. The reason is usually because they are irresponsible byb's or just ignorant & cannot be bothered & it makes me so angry to see these beautiful animals with such a great lack of discipline. A good dog is well disciplined & mixes well with other people & their Animals.  I have two rescued Pedigree Whippets Bella who is almost 8 years old & considering how bad her first 4 years of life were she is a model pet.  She is rarely naughty & is a very faithful & loving companion.  I also have a 15 month old Whippet puppy who was adopted last October & she is doing well too, occasionally she is really naughty but at her age she is just a child playing pranks.  Yes she is always being told off but gently. (She cowers when you raise your voice or move suddenly.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I have to Boxers females & they tow the line & I love them & it's a shame people get dogs & don't train them or put them on chains which should be illegality & do nothing with them or putting them in pens & only feed & water them why do they even want a dog if it's for protection then they should get surveillance &/or security|`|tFKQYT6Naa	well in most cases they dont just let them take over their life it just happens if they dont show and train there dogs to know that the owners are the boss... it ususally just gets out of hand if the owners dont train the pets and lets them do whatever they want..it is quite pathetic but its not something they want but its their fault for not teaching the dog...|`|09fdLaeIaa	because they are cute<br>  gosh<br>  i have a dog<br>  are you racist against dogs?<br>  get one|`|iSp1ur26aa	I think the problem starts when people treat their dogs as if they are real people and not just an animal. Many dog owners don't realize that dogs are naturally pack animals and need someone to lay down rules. They need a "leader of the pack." When dogs don't have this discipline in their lives they run wild and while the owner may think that it's cute, it's not productive for the dog. Bottom line, people need to realize that no matter how much they think their dog is their "child" it's really just a pet.|`|c8uI3n0Raa	I hate it too.  My fiance's grandma has a stupid little chihuahua that she let's it do AAAnything she wants and pleases. Yaps uncontrolably, gets in the garbage, gets in the cat box, harrasses the cats, and is not fully potty trained, ect.  I KNOW that the stupid thing thinks it's 'dominate' in the family, but whenever she does something bad, noone scolds her and when I myself try and teach her manners, I get yelled at because it's 'her baby'.  Hmph.  I'm just trying to help.|`|bRxWkpfBaa	I agree.  I hate when people can't or won't train their dogs! Both of my dogs are very well trained and I will never have a dog that isn't.

EdB0ghKwaa	Cats are naturally very clean animals, and a dirty litter tray will upset them, and cause behavioral problems.  Also, a litter tray to near to their food will put them off using it (would you like to eat your dinner near a used toilet?!!!!!).  Her cat could end up pooping in places she doesn't want.<br>  <br>  There is also the issue of toxomoplosis, which is a virus present in dog and cat poop, and can be deadly, although mainly to humans!! If she has small children in the house, or is pregnant this is especially important!<br>  <br>  If she uses cat litter crystals, the urine isn't so much of a problem (it absorbs the urine and odour, and only has to be changed every 4 weeks or so), but she MUST remove any poop when it appears!  Tell her to use a scoop and a nappy bag to put it in (to reduce the smell).  I know it's not nice, but you have to accept this being a cat owner.  Also, her home must stink if she doesn't remove the poop!|`|vgh629AZaa	I'm not positive on this, but I'm sure that this could eventually give him an infection. Not only that, it is simply unsanitary. The odor is probably terrible. Eventually, the cat will find somewhere else to use the bathroom. Cats are animals of somewhat decent hygiene. -- there is no way her pet appreciates this. It is unhealthy for both her & her cat with all the germs.|`|agLImxKTaa	To each his own...  some people scoop and some people don't...  I am a scooper...  but I know plenty of people who just wait and dump the whole thing...  it's not going to harm the cat and if it's not going outside the box then it's not particularly bothered by it.|`|ALNOT9ELaa	Maybe when she thinks about the cat putting his germy paws on her she will think differently. If the poop is not scooped and the cats digs in it then guess what? Poop bacteria is all over her paws and claws!|`|z2cysiEhaa	Cat will eventually start pooping elsewhere in the house. They are by nature clean animals and usually will not use an already soiled litter box.|`|9gPlIs3Xaa	That's just nasty!

MstjbpVJaa	Is this the first  laying of your birds? <br>  <br>  A young hen does not recognise an egg of it's own doing and that is possibly why they have eaten it,also do they have a good supply of Cuttle-bone,as it could be lacking Calcium and the new egg is it's only source.<br>  <br>  Do they have a nest box as just laying eggs on the floor of their cage will only help them to eat the eggs.<br>  <br>  She could lay up to 6 eggs,before going to brood them.<br>  <br>  Yes!!! when the C*ck bird is mating with the hen that is the process they go through,<br>  <br>  I believe it would be of a great advantage if your bought a book on Zebra Finches and it would answer all your questions.|`|5efcbc663b7fc36633fcb20f8ab06f77aa	They ate it. Do they have a nesting box? if not she needs a secure dark place to lay her eggs otherwise she will feel stressed which leads to them eating them or abending them. The first time they lay they can mess it up, my zebra finched sat on the top perch and layed her egg. DUH! We put in a nesting box and they hatched the eggs but the chicks didnt survive because they stoped feeding them for some reason and we couldnt get them to eat. And yes they are mateing when he is on her back and flapping his wings. She will most likley lay more as they have been matting.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Sometimes they eat the eggs. Gross, I know, but it's true.  Or, it could have dropped in the water dish or something.  You may find it somewhere yet.<br>  Edit:  Yes, what you described is their mating.  And it's true that they do know when the eggs aren't fertile and will eat them.  (I always wondered how they can tell.)<br>  Joanne, I've had success with those wicker nests they have for finches, and my mother--wow, her finches breed like crazy.  So, it doesn't have to be a box, but they do need a nice secure place to lay eggs.  <br>  Also, get some nesting material or just tear up some tissues and put them in there.  The male will take them into the nest.|`|yJWr6TxMaa	Zebra finches sometimes eat their eggs, it's an extra source of calcium & protein & also may be an indication that are not intended to be parents.

She wakes up in hostpital to find out her mum is dead and her dad, who she was told had been dead since she was 3, is actually alive and her mum had lied that he was dead. She had actually devorsed him and gone to court to make sure he couldn't come near Julie and Janna, her sister. Julie has no choice but to go live with him in a massave estate with great stables. She takes midnight, her black arabian stallion, and Cassie , Midnights mum, with her. Midnight is her only comfortare, he loves her alot and wont let anyone else near him.

I knew the first man a very kind person who brought Andalusian to  America. This was in the early 70s . He owned a beautiful Saddle bred horse as well named Something Sensational as well and some quarter horses. I was honored to be with the family when they went to the docks o pick up the horses. I will never forget the experience. The horses came down the gang plank one at a time one more beautiful than the other, Then came the stallion Ganadore! In my memory there was Never a more Beautiful horse and I have seen quite a few.  His main was silver with white highlights and his coat was like a soft satin silver blanket over his skin. He came down the gang plank and the sun hit his coat and he seemed to gleam as something un real like a Majestic unearthly being gracing us with his presence. He was so well built and so balanced that he could not move wrongly if he tried.  For such a young horse he was so well behaved . I could not believe what I was seeing!<br>  <br>      I have been very blessed by God over the years but that Horse and the kindness of the Woodcocks to allow me to be with them to witness this and then allow me to see the horses up close  at their home was something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.<br>  <br>    Something about morgans with the old type reminds me of htose Andelusions but they were never the color or the style of that horse!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have always loved morgan's|`|2AdJStDYaa	umm what about a story about a young filly (teen female horse) whose dad is a champion thoroughbred but wants to be part of a child's horseback riding barn instead. theme is pressure, and moral is "if you don't want to follow in your parents' footsteps, that's okay.|`|AA10356572	I will give you two.. but the first is about a donkey<br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Aggie-The-Wonder-Donkey.459871" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Aggie-The-W...</a><br>  <br>  here is the horse one<br>  <a href="http://www.sportales.com/Equestrian/Winning-Isnt-Everything-at-a-Horse-Show.76671" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportales.com/Equestrian/Winn...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you just want them for your own reading.. not to copy or anything - beause that is illegal!|`|mKWwz1uUaa	This is a true story, <br>  Once very long ago this young girl just learning about horses listened to others opinions and hadn't formed her own and said "Never will I own a Bay (color) Arabian (breed) mare!"

Well that horse turned out to be her best friend, and she loved her dearly, and she got sick one day very sick and was only 6 yrs old (can live 38 plus yrs) and well I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life to stop her suffering, and I did.

You can stop now. All you have to do is give them time to get used to each other. <br>  If your old cat is growling at you for what seems to be no apparent reason, you might have the new cat's scent on you.<br>  <br>  When we got a new cat Dasher, my first cat didn't really pay attention to him. Dasher somehow knew that Gremlin was already king.<br>  When Comet and Spunkie came along, Gremlin did the same thing as he did to Dasher. Dasher, however, kept growling. He eventually came acustom to Comet and Spunkie, and even tried to teach them his little trick: opening doors with the handle. Though it's funny: Comet and Spunkie never questioned Gremlin's authority, but once Gremlin died, it was obvious that Dasher would take over. However, Comet and Spunkie still challenge Dasher's authority to this day.|`|6pouFxBCaa	The older cat will step up soon, or already, to show this new comber that he/she is in charge.<br>  Helping along with that is good, but not necessary. <br>  Stop whenever you see a sign of hierarchy with your cats (when it appears the younger one has learned).<br>  It won't take long, and it won't be forever. <br>  If you are tired / whatever of it now, that's fine to, they will establish this themselves.|`|8qF4urLLaa	Why would you do it at all...why does #1 HAVE to be dominant?   I think the cats just work that kind of stuff out among themselves...no?|`|UNFxjNHkaa	You should stop doing that now - they'll decide who the dominant cat is!  The dominant cat in my house is the 2nd cat I got.  They just decided that he was more of the "leader"|`|gwhutbkdaa	Don't worry miss if they aren't fighting their not fighting their O.K so stop what you're doing and see what they do .
OxFsslN8aa	This is an issue that takes time and patience to work through.  First your dog needs to understand and follow the basic commands of sit, stay and come.   <br>  <br>  Next - dogs bark for a number of reasons - fear, excitement, etc - once you find out what makes him bark you can work on stopping it.  Dogs that bark out of fear need a confident assertive leader to "take over" for them.  Dogs that bark out of excitement need to be taught patience - sitting for food, heeling on walks, waiting for toys, etc.   <br>  <br>  I have a fearful dachshund who barks at people and I am working to teach her "enough".  When she is done eating I say enough; when we are done doing our obedience training is say enough; when I am done petting her I say enough.  Anytime I want something to end I say enough.  When I want her to stop barking I say enough - many times she stops but not all the time.  She is young. I hope it gets better with time and consistency.  Good luck.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	get a kong and fill it with peanut butter. give it  to him so he has something else to focus on.<br>  <br>  im sure the peanut butter is more tempting than the new smelly person.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	You need to have him leashed for the next few weeks when you have people over.  Make sure that the leash is up around the top of his neck, just behind the ears.  If he starts barking give him a firm tug and a strict "ah-ah!"<br>  <br>  Make sure that when people come into your house they don't look, talk to or touch your dog.  Any attention to the dog will only promote his state of mind.  We've been having a problem recently with jumping up so we've posted a small sign on the door for anyone coming in to just ignore the dogs and walk past them.  Only when they've settled down do they get attention.<br>  <br>  I would also consider getting obedience training if you haven't already.  Trainers have a wealth of knowledge about controlling a dog no matter the size or the situation.<br>  <br>  Remember, patience is the key in all situations.  Dogs require consistent behavior corrections in order for it to stick.  Hang in there.|`|nZg00MQOaa	Just as human language is multifaceted and multipurpose, barking allows a dog to communicate many different messages in a variety of situations. It can signal a request to an owner ("Hey, I want to go outside!"), impart a warning ("You're in my territory!"), or simply serve to amuse when a dog has little else to do.<br>  An instinctive canine behavior, a bark now and then reminds you that your dog is still very much a dog. However, constant barking can be disruptive, if not downright nerve-racking. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent or curb problem barking.<br>  <br>  Here;s how to stop the barking <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=927414170131798960783275271551" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=927414170131...</a>|`|MTYKvPOFaa	When I have guest come over I put a harness on my dog and he becomes very submissive. I trained him to do this my putting on the harness and attaching a short collar to it and walking around the house with him by my side and telling him no to barking....and then when I remove it I play with him allowing him to bark and be free... when company comes over harness goes back on and possibly collar depending on how controlled he is.... one year after doing this he will just follow me around and lay at my feet when collar is on...but make sure that you remove the collar when guests are not over you have to respect your dog if you expect them to respect you.... GOOD LUCK!|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Does he continue to bark once others are inside?  If not then what's the problem he is making your house far more secure.  Never use the cruelty of a collar to correct behavior.<br>  <br>  Try this get a pop can and fill it with pennies and when he barks shake the can and then put him in his crate very temporarily.  then allow him back out.  Once he knows the routine he will stop, you say he is a puppy, puppies bark.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have trained my dogs to respond to the "no bark" command. They know "no" really well and if I say "no barK" they will quit. It helps to have something to distract them like a special new toy or dinner that is more interesting than the new guests. You just need to work on it. Having the guest give a small treat is a way to introduce new people, but don't force it if he won't approach them.
CkecSp4Uaa	All puppies are born with folded ears regardless of breed.  In most prick-eared breeds the ears will stand on their own as the puppy matures and the cartilage in the ears harden.  In all prick-eared breeds there is a possibility that the ears will not stand due to weak ear cartilage or damage to the cartilage.  But in all breeds that call for upright ears folded or "lazy" ears are a serious fault.  It does sometimes happen that adult corgies have folded ears, but it is much more common for the ears to stand (their ears are not quite as large as say a german shepherd's ears where weak cartilage is a little more common).|`|F2JEvYX7aa	usually they are perky when they are adults. My Corgi always folds his ears back when he is being affectionate. Corgi's are great dogs.|`|h09gCzJgaa	the corgis ear's are suppose to be erect when they have reached adult hood, for the ears to be folded or floppy is a serious fault, some ppl will result to taping them up to help the corgi's ears become erect.  others may have an injury to the nerve which will cause the ear to not stand up.|`|3zv2bbolaa	If their ear cartilage fails to stiffen as it properly should, then the ears will break over. Most Corgi's ears are standing by 14 weeks of age, some even earlier. <br>  <br>  When the ears do not stand, they are referred to as a "lazy ear" and it is a serious breed fault.

You have to breed pure, to get pure!|`|JM4Uiunqaa	How are you going to get a purebred dog from breeding a mutt and a purebred? That's not how this thing called genetics works. It's not as though your dog is literally staffy on one side and ebt on the other, the genes are all mixed together in a wonderful conglomeration called a mutt. The puppies will be 1/4 ebt 3/4 staffy. Nothing special about them, nothing to make them different from any mutts in the pound or on the street.

DtkLsetkaa	Is he neutered?  If not, then this is your #1 best solution.  Get him fixed and he will most likely stop spraying.  Do not have this poor cat put to sleep, there are people out there who will care for him and understand that what he needs is love and training, not death.  Contact your local shelter.|`|VMY7No0eaa	is your cat NEUTERED???? they spray when they are not.<br>  if he is neutered.and sprays...<br>  I have been told if you give them FEMALE hormones it lowers the testosterone in the cat.<br>  I clean with alcohol <br>  If you take him to the humane soc most likely he will be put down. <br>  or you can find him a home where he will be a outside cat > like a barn cat... so he will be FREEEEE to spray what ever he wants.<br>  <br>  Can YOU make him an outside cat...or inside/ outside.<br>  <br>  I have one that sprays and as long as he has access to the outside he doesn't spray inside my house... he does his petrol and is happy.<br>  when I coop him up inside then he sprays... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	This is a very difficult situation. I would recommend to surrender him to a shelter or humane society. Either one will evaluate him and if they think he could go to a new home they will put him up for adoption. Once a male cat sprays repeatedly it's so hard to get them out of the habit. I know how hard it is to give an animal up but it's something you might have to do.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	If you aren't able to keep him your only option really is to euthanize him. No shelter is going to take him and place him for adoption if he sprays because, as you have discovered, no one wants a cat that doesn't use its litter box (yourself included).|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you could neuter him..<br>  if that doesn't work, make sure that he's going to have a good home..<br>  if nobody wants him, make sure you put him in a good humane society..|`|zZjjBS7Taa	neuter him duhhhh|`|nNGrfHdTaa	Its not fair to Put Him to sleep Because he Pee's Alot,<br>  Thats just Unfair,<br>  I would advise you to talk to the Rspca about what to do,<br>  Or Some cat sancturys Will take him in And look after him,|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Has he been neutered? If not, this will stop it.<br>  <br>  If he has been neutered, he could be stressed or ill.  Take him to your vet to check it out, and if there are no medical problems, then look at his stress levels.  Is his litter tray cleaned out regularly?  Has another cat joined the house recently?  Is he being bullied outside by another cat?  These could all be reasons, and your vet can recommend medication that can calm him down.<br>  <br>  Please don't give up hope yet, he is part of your life, and I'm sure you would hate yourself if you had to get him rehomed.  If he is stressed, this will only make matters worse!|`|NPr6dVYZaa	If he is not neutered, neuter him. Also, speak with your vet about different medications that he could be put on to help calm him and stop the spraying. Please don't get rid of him for a issue that can be resolved.|`|yczfFQXmaa	Is he fixed?  Usually cats don't spray if they're neutered though now that he has that habit, he may do it anyway.  Unfortunately, no one else wants a cat spraying all over their house either.  If you can't solve the spraying problem, you should take him to the humane society, but odds are low that anyone will adopt a 9 year old sprayer.  I'd suggest talking to a vet (the humane society may be able to connect you with one that will discuss this with you for free) because you may be able to solve the problem and not have to surrender your cat.
sG00ks0Raa	they go into heat every month like a girls period lol she should have it by march 7th if she doesnt she got pregnate|`|XOtN0mzNaa	The female cat has 2-4 estrous periods every year, each lasting 15-22 days. If she is bred, estrus seldom lasts more than 4 days. <br>  If successful mating does not occur, estrus may last for 7-10 days and recur at 15- to 21-day intervals. It is possible for an unmated female to cycle every 3-4 weeks indefinitely.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	do you want her to be in heat??|`|Rw7gi86Naa	You need to get her to a vet so you can:<br>  A. Find out if she is pregnant.<br>  B. Make an appointment to have her spayed.<br>  <br>  Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems.

J5hsCONRaa	Vicky, I'm sorry and am glad you took the time to process the information I gave you. Hopefully your vet will have provided you with some good pain relief for him and advised you where to go with him regarding treatment. He is going to need careful socialisation with other dogs regarding this. Make sure he is around CALM dogs only, none that will knock him around or try to play too much. As in my previous post, if he associates Dogs with the Pain in his jaw, you could well end up with dog issues when he is older. Westies need great socialising with dogs without this issue anyway, especially the males, so great care needs to be taken.<br>  Also, let people know when they rush up to you with your "cute pup" to avoid patting his head or roughing him up. Talk to them about it and encourage them to fuss him on the body instead. This is important so that again, he doesnt associate Strangers with Pain and therefore becomes a "fear-biter".<br>  Has your vet discussed Ops with you or just pain-management?<br>  <br>  ADD - No probs Vicky. Am sure your vet would have picked it up sooner or later, just glad to help! Hopefully they will advise a good diet for him also to ensure he is getting enough fluid as some pups can be put off drinking due to extension of the tongue causing pain. I have only heard of one case in where they performed  a sort of "bone filing" op but I dont think this is very wide-spread. It may well be a development route they are going down to see if it can be a true treatment for it, but its worth asking?
B6zl0AJDaa	Anytime you have horses together there will be a pecking order established.  There will be a higharchy of the more dominant horses and the more submissive horses.  The only time I haven't seen that senario played out was with my old QH gelding who'd raised my much younger TB.  They'd play together but NEVER fought over food or anything else.  IF a younger horse was turned out with them and got to "playing" too rough for the old gelding, I'd watch my younger TB, step into the middle of it and rear up as if to say, "I can handle your play, play with ME!".|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Your boy may take advantage of the older ones. I would put them to start in adjacent paddocks where they can meet over the fence and gradually introduce him under careful supervision.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	It depends on the horses. <br>  <br>  I own two geldings, and they are in a pasture that contains 3 other mares and 3 other geldings. There is no fighting at all. They get along fine. <br>  <br>  There are 2 other pastures at my barn, one is half mares half geldings, they get along fine as well. There herd dynamic is a little more intense because of a crabby mare, but they get along fine 95% of the time.<br>  <br>  The other is 4 mares and a gelding pony. There is a mare that is 100% absalutely the boss in that pasture, and the other horses know it. But they are all fine, respect their boundries and there are never any problems.<br>  <br>  My aunt keeps three geldings together and I've never seen them fight or get crabby, except for when the newest horse was first introduced to the herd - but that's expected. My horses have been with them too and they got along fine. (5 geldings) <br>  <br>  The people that live next door to the barn I ride at have 6 mares and they are horrible together. They are always squelling and kicking, etc. <br>  <br>  <br>  We have one gelding at our barn that is very aggressive, but right now he's seperated because of an injury.|`|PWankIUpaa	Yes. <br>  You have to really know your horses before you turn them out together .It is always best to turn your horses out in a paddock first so that you can control the situation before turning them out in a pasture. Have plenty of people on hand and have horses on a Lounge line the first times.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	The only thing that will happen is the most dominent will become the boss. This has happened with my gelding. He just kicks the floor and swishes his tail and the others will back off, or they get a bite. Dont worry, they will act like a herd. Horses dont hurt each other they just show each other who is boss.|`|uec7RIhbaa	not necessarily.  there's no yes and no as it totally depends on the horses but we have different groups - some are all geldings, some are colts and geldings, some are all mares and some are a mixture of sexes (obviously no colts with mares tho!!!).|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	What they will do is determine on their own who will be dominate after you put them together.<br>  Fighting might be to strong of a word but they might squeal, rear, kick and buck for a few days until they work it out.  The squealing can sound just awful but is nothing but a noise.<br>  In a week or so you will see who won their private war.<br>  You might get a bloody butt or shoulder but what the geldings do shouldn't be to bad.<br>  This behavior can last a long time so be patient and let them work it out.  I've had it last up to 3 months.  My poor Arab was bloody every night coming in than one day it just stopped.  He is on the bottom of the totem pole and knows it.  The 10 hh pony is above him in rank.<br>  You might be pleasantly surprised that they know right away who will be the dominate horse.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Kath|`|UIM8X38Oaa	They will still establish pecking order but it is usually not as bad as if there was a mare in the mix, Should be fine just keep an eye on them for a while.  <br>  They usually just hang out :)<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|RAjnTL2Vaa	any herd of horse will 'discuss" the pecking order<br>  I find it best when introducing horse<br>  to put the new horse in a field next to the herd for a few days|`|5kUxkun3aa	Two dominants will fight it out. <br>  They may get over it. You will have to try it and keep around to maybe split them up.|`|Avc3o0uCaa	yeah they will fight all horses fight it normal is any one getting hurt
5PsKGss7aa	Yes, Ive heard that is  true.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They can.  It depends on the breed - some are lazy like danes & other are more hyper like labs or goldens.  I had a dane in a condo & she was fine.  We walked daily & had room for them to potty outdoors.  She would have preferred to never go outdoors if given her choice.|`|GXM74MGPaa	I have a small 1 bedroom apartment. I have a doxie. And she fits well. I can NOT imagine having a large dog. I do walk her every day and take her to the park. However, small dogs have tons for energy that they can not release in small apartments.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would say no - you can't really make a generalization like that.<br>  <br>  Even an experienced dog owner would not have owned every single dog of every single breed - it just isn't possible and you cannot say "Hey, that dog is a Border Collie! I had one once.. that dog must be exactly like mine!" Plus an experienced owner would have, well, enough experience to make the situation livable (even with a high energy dog) where as a novice may not.<br>  <br>  A dog's ability to live in an apartment depends on the dog's energy level and your ability to exercise and train. I wouldn't depend on breed to tell me a dog's ability to live in an apartment - one Border Collie may be high energy and cramp while another may be a total couch potato. Older dogs would also have less energy than a puppy.<br>  <br>  At the same time not all SMALL breeds would work either. They too need exercise, and tend to be more destructive OR annoying because many owners think "Hey, small dog means it doesn't need walked!" So the dog has a lot of excess energy.<br>  <br>  Get what i'm saying?<br>  <br>  ANY dog can live in an apartment so long as they get the proper exercise and training.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	Yes this is true. The problem is that it's not fair to them if they don't have room to move and run around. This is why you see a lot of people in NY that own Great Danes. They are huge dogs but are considered penthouse/apartment dogs.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	I've heard that too. I heard that great danes are the best. Although they are rather large, they are pretty relaxed and aren't as hyper as smaller dogs so they don't require as much exercise.|`|RgYuXggfaa	From what I have seen, yes and no.  There isn't as much room in an apartment, compared to some houses there is more.  There is no yard for them.  They aren't as hyper as smaller dogs and depending on the breed not as destructive.  There are some that like to be the lazy dog like a retired greyhound.  We have the upper of a house and a St. Bernard.  We do have almost 2 acres for him to run when he wants.  He really likes to just sit with us when we are home though.|`|sW8eg01saa	no bigger dogs do not do better in apartments. they have to have space. now smaller dogs do better in apartments.|`|D4MLkMglaa	NO!?!?! i hav a greyhound and he luvs the house, and hates apartments( exept 4 the first day or so cause thatz all dogs)|`|KuUx34hCaa	it depends on the dog & your willingness to make sure it's taken out as much as need weather you want to or not|`|6MLqrB3faa	if your willing to walk it continuously|`|qOzenqjEaa	no its not true big dogs need space
VDP3pNCPaa	Well, at 13 years of age, she will spend a lot of time lying around.  But signs that she is getting better are in her behavior towards eating and drinking;  normal output in the litter box, and she shows an interest in things around her.  From what you have described, she seems on the road to recovery.

1omgPICKaa	You could call animal control but if they are meeting his basic needs there may not be a lot they can do.<br>  <br>  Talk to your neighbours about fixing it, or you could even offer to buy him back. Then either keep him or find someone who will give him lots of love (experienced bird owner). You could go on an online bird forum and ask if anyone can help you out with rescueing him.|`|Ah5a1xWvaa	If he's really being neglected, you should call animal control.

DtkLsetkaa	If you have allergies, spend some time at the shelter with the cat you wish to adopt to see if you react. <br>  <br>  Litter box = Not a covered one, it traps the smell inside and the cats won't use it because it smells bad. Use an odor absorbing litter, but try to stay away from the scented ones.  Cats may not like the smell and will refuse to use it.  Just place an air freshener near the box and your (and your cats) nose will be just fine.<br>  <br>  Scratching posts = sometimes this is wait and see which kind he prefers.  Ask the shelter which is favorite scratcher was, and get the exact same kind.  <br>  <br>  Food = Start out with whatever the shelter was feeding him, and slowly move over to your own mix.  Wet food is better than dry, a raw diet is best.<br>  <br>  Toys = Go nuts!!!  Catnip mice, a cat teaser, little spongy balls are all good, but this is another "anything goes".  Dexter's favorite are the balls, and Deb's are the mice, but both go crazy for a balled up piece of tape or a paper bag ;)  This is going to be so fun for you!!  OH!!  Don't forget a laser pointer.  I have one I got for $5 and my cats go wild for it.  There is nothing like watching them go into full on hunter mode when they see that little red dot.  Its too much fun!!<br>  <br>  Spend time with the cats you are looking at and your cat will pick you.  Congratulations on your new family member, you are going to LOVE being a cat mom :)|`|uBFhKXgHaa	I'll handle the food question!<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

You can spend more money on the fancy self-cleaning ones but research before buying.  Not all cats like them.  I just use your basic plastic trays.  You *might* consider getting two, one for both floors.  Or not, but if you don't be sure the kitty knows where it is.<br>  <br>  Litter:  I use Fresh Step clumping (unscented) as a bottom layer and fill the rest with FS clay.  I like this combo approach because clumping litter can get stuck on bloomers and paws plus I don't like having fine gravel scattered across the floor, but it is very good for helping reduce urine odors since you can easily remove those clumps.  But clay litter is not considered "green" and I'm not sure about the clumping stuff either.  There are "green" brands if that's a concern for you.<br>  <br>  Toys:  Don't spend a lot of money.  The more you spend the less likely they'll play with it.  Start collecting rings from milk bottles.  Cardboard boxes, paper bags.  You can buy fuzzy little mice and balls and a few other small items.  Get some catnip (sold dried in bulk) that you can use to scent toys with, or buy toys that already have it on them.  You can buy stringy toys but do not leave your cat alone with them.  Not for a good year or so.  Some cats eat string and that can be expensive or fatal.  Until you know that your cat isn't one of them it's best to supervise this type of toy.  Hold off on spending more money until you get the cat and see what kind of play it prefers, then you can buy toys to suit it.<br>  <br>  Scratching posts:  Here too your cat will possibly have a preference.  Poppy likes the cardboard ones that lay flat on the ground.  She rarely stands up to scratch.  But Sophie likes a homemade one that I've mounted on the wall.  It's basically a seat cushion covered with a tweedy fabric.  Neither liked the sisal kind.<br>  <br>  Food:  The best cat food is a raw meat diet, properly researched and supplemented to ensure that each meal is balanced.  Next up are grainless canned foods, then canned foods with grains but not the common corn, wheat or soy, and then grainless dry foods.  After that you have swill.  Rule of thumb is don't shop at the grocery store.  Don't believe the advertising you might see.  Don't even trust your vet to be able to suggest a good cat food.  Most of them are undereducated in this area.<br>  <br>  Don't neglect dental health either.  Plan to brush your cat's teeth from day one, and you'll hopefully never have to take it in for a cleaning!<br>  <br>  Your cat shopping plan is a good one.  Spend time with a kitten/cat and see how you all feel about each other.  Do not make the mistake of choosing a cat based on its looks.  Pretty cats will suck you in but they might not have the personality you desire.|`|Uy79dKEmaa	I can speak to cat allergies.  I have allergies, but I've had a cat (or cats) for over 17 years.  What I've found is that the more time you spend with a cat, the more your tolerance will build.  I've had luck with shorthair cats, and for some reason (unknown to me) it seems that white or white mixed with other coloring cats cause the least reaction.  I don't know why, but that's just how it is for me.<br>  <br>  I do get symptoms, particularly if I get cat hair in my eyes or have spent a lot of time brushing out shedding coats.  However, I take some allergy medications that pretty much eliminate them.  I take a Claritin before bed (so I don't wake up stuffy) and use Nasonex spray in the morning.  The Nasonex is more for my other seasonal allergies but it helps with the cat allergies as well.  The Claritin lasts for 24 hours and does not make me drowsy at all.  Claritin is available OTC and is available in generic form called Loratidine.  The generic is much cheaper and works just as well.<br>  <br>  You are definitely on the right track by playing with a cat first to see what kind of reaction you get, or don't get.  I hope my suggestions will help for the occasional reaction you may get.<br>  <br>  I also want to say thanks for adopting an adult cat.  So often the sweetest cats are overlooked just because they are no longer kittens.  One benefit of adopting an adult is their personalities are already developed, so you know what you're getting!<br>  <br>  I wish you many happy years with your new kitty!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	It is wonderful that you are seeking an adult cat, as often they have a harder time finding a home.  But there is one suggestion before you even bring your new cat home, and that is a trip to the vet for a health evaluation, basically so there are no surprises.  You are not insulting the place you got the cat, you are setting up a relationship with a vet.<br>  <br>  Most cats take to the inexpensive cardboard scratchers so I would start with that.  Some cats don't like vertical surfaces to scratch on, so why start with an expensive post?<br>  <br>  Most people now use clumping litter, and either a covered litter box, or one with spill shield sides.  It is usually recommended to have two litter boxes.<br>  <br>  For food, I am of the opinion you generally get what you pay for, and stick with brand name foods.  But for starting out, get the same food as the cat is eating, and if you want to change, do it gradually to avoid tummy upsets.<br>  <br>  Toys?  Well, the toy furry mice are generally universally popular.  Get extras, as they usually prefer to play with them awhile, and then stick them under furniture and out of reach.<br>  <br>  A tortie is a color pattern, and says nothing about whether they will cause an allergy problem.  Torties do tend to be a bit mouthy, but not as mouthy as a Siamese.<br>  <br>  Your idea of playing with a cat at the shelter is a good idea.  Allow the cat to select you.  While that may seem strange, sometimes in playing with a cat, the cat makes a special contact with you.  Those types of adoptions often are the most rewarding.|`|agLImxKTaa	I've had cats my whole life and the type of cat isn't really an indicator of it's personality or temperment.  Go and let the cat "pick" you.   As for products, there are plenty of starter kits at pet stores for around $20, start there.  Use the food/litter the shelter recommends at first and then change the food according to what your cat likes.  Its the skin flakes that cause allergic reactions - called dander - some cats produce more.  Go for a shorter haired cat rather than a longer hair variety.  And keep allergy meds on hand in case you need them.  Vaccum the hair/dander as often as you need to.  Including furniture.|`|YCvgjLdnaa	for the food, any general cat food is good, but of the cats i know they prefer brands like "iams" "whiskers" and "go cat" you will need to look at what your cat prefers, which you will learn in time. as you try out different things. you can also buy for example co-ops own which is just a brand of cat food made by that shop. its generally cheaper.<br>  if you are planning on buying a kitten you will need to buy kitten food, if an adult, cat food for adults and for senior cat food for senior etc. also when you get to know your cat. you can buy food for indoor or outdoor cats which gives them the vitamins they need for a long and healthy life.<br>  litter is just a basic thing and any is ok. they are all really the same, but some are scented so you can make your choice about that. or if your cat is an outdoor cat then you wont even need cat litter.<br>  scratch posts are probably the mostprefered toys for cats. it also keeps their claws trimmed, if they do not have a scratch post then they will probably do this to your fence lol, so your choice. also and dangly toys with little feathery objects on the end are good and cats love them.<br>  this is how you can reduce your allergicness to cats - <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/tp/allergyproducts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/tp/allergyprodu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Being-Allergic-to-Cats" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Being-A...</a><br>  basically make your cat an area where he or she can sleep, thats not your room so you can sleep in a completely cat free area without the fear of not being able to sleep because of sneezing, scratching etc.<br>  you can also buy special filters to clean the air, which work good<br>  there is a list that is believed to be the least allergenic cats which should help -<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/allergiesandcats/tp/CatAllergies_Breeds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/allergiesandcat...</a><br>  and if you can, try and get an indoor cat, that way they will live longer, cost you less in food/ vet bills etc. and will not bring in even more pollen etc. <br>  this tells you about general care and how to check they are healthy and that you have everything they need; good luck  <br>  <a href="http://www.avma.org/animal_health/brochures/selecting/cat/selecting_cat_brochure.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/animal_health/brochu...</a>|`|yczfFQXmaa	I'm allergic to cats too and have been able to keep mine with no problems.  Get a HEPA air filter (one for upstairs and one for down in your case).  Also, get the allergen filters for your A/C air intake.  This will help a lot with the dander in the air.  Make a habit early on of not letting the cat in your bed (perhaps the whole bedroom).  This has worked for me.<br>  <br>  Litter can be stinky! Get a covered litter box.  It keeps the smell down.  I use Arm and Hammer litter.  It's sort of pricey, but also keeps the smell down.  <br>  <br>  My cat eats Iams by the vet's recommendation.  But I've also heard Science Diet and Eukanuba are good.  It can be tricky changing a cat's diet, so find out what the shelter feeds and start with that.  Then ask your vet if that food is healthy (some of the cheaper brands are full of sawdust!).  <br>  <br>  Scratching posts: get a lot!  Cats will want to scratch wherever they hang out often.  The cardboard scratching ramps are cheap and most cats like them.  Just rub some catnip on them.  Place them in the rooms the cat spends time in and any time you see it scratching, tell it "No" then move it to the scratcher.  If the cat doesn't like the cardboard, you may have to move to a rope or carpeted scratcher.  <br>  <br>  Toys vary by how the cat plays.  Pay attention when you play with it at the shelter.  The old standbys I always recommend are shoelaces (never seen a cat who didn't love a shoelace) and the toy mice with real fur on them (I think cats like the smell-the fabric ones don't seem the same).  Another god-send is the over-the-door toys.  Those can keep kitty out of trouble while you're gone. My current cat plays fetch, so the balls with the bells in them are her favorite.  My advice is stick to the cheap stuff and pay attention to what the cat tends to like.  I'm guessing the shelter will tell you this, but the best toy for a cat is another cat.  They do much better in twos and will cause you much less trouble if they're entertained.

Muz6YB18aa	I would have her spayed to eliminate the risk of pyometra. This is the medical reason that most vets recommend spaying.<br>  <br>  Pyometra is a very serious uterine infection that can be avoided simply by having your dog spayed. When the female dog is spayed, the uterus - as well as the ovaries - are removed, eliminating the risk of pyometra.<br>  <br>  Literally, pyometra means pus in the uterus. Generally occurring about six weeks after the female dog's last heat cycle, pyometra can initially present NO SYMPTOMS, allowing time for the dog to become extremely ill, unbeknownst to most of their owners.<br>  <br>  By the time you've noticed possible first clues that the dog is sick - like extreme thirst, failure to eat or drink, loss of energy, or a foul smell - the dog's life could already be threatened. If the dog is discharging, (open pyometra as opposed to closed pyometra) she'll stand a better chance, though, than if the infection simply can't escape.<br>  <br>  Any vet will recommend emergency surgery for a dog that has pyometra. Without the surgery, the pus will continue to accumulate in the uterus, causing a risk of rupture. After rupture there may be little the vet can do to save your pet. As a matter of fact, you might not even know the uterus has ruptured until it's way too late.<br>  <br>  Pyometra may occur in young to middle-aged dogs, though it is MOST COMMON IN OLDER DOGS. After many years of estrus cycles without pregnancy, the uterine wall undergoes the changes that promote this disease.<br>  <br>  The typical time for pyometra to occur is about 1-2 months following estrus.<br>  <br>  THE DISEASE CAN EFFECT ANY DOG THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPAYED.<br>  <br>  Spaying is the recommended method of avoiding pyometra altogether, but many pet owners fail to have their pets spayed.<br>  <br>  If your dog hasn't been spayed be on the lookout for pyometra symptoms within six weeks of the dog's last heat cycle. First symptoms include increased thirst or failure to drink. The dog usually won't take any food - even table scraps. Or you may only notice a lack of energy.<br>  <br>  An ill female dog that is drinking an increased (or decreased) amount of water and has not been spayed is always suspected of having pyometra. This is especially true if there is a vaginal discharge or an enlarged abdomen.<br>  <br>  I just don't think it is worth the risk. (My 3.5 pound chihuahua was a pyometra suspect when urinating frequently and losing her appetite. I chose to have her spayed at that time.) That was 5 years ago and she's not fat. I hope this helps you in making your decision. <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your tiny new friend!<br>  <br>  (Sorry the post is so long, I'm not trying to rant, just wanted to give as much info as possible.)|`|WWhYCAbSaa	Spay her anyway.  She probably will not stop having heat cycles, and the idiot that gave her to you is incredibly stupid.  Spayed dogs who get enough exercise don't get fat.<br>  <br>  Some vets will spay during a heat cycle.  Call around.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Unlike humans, dogs do not go through menopause.  She will continue to have heat cycles every year until the year she dies.  And with every heat cycle the risk of pyometra and reproductive cancers increases.  Wait for her to come out of heat and get her spayed.  Responsible breeders have their females spayed once they are done having puppies because it is better for the dog.  Spaying has such an impact on a female's health that vets recommend spaying even in dogs that have already developed mammary tumors/cancers because it reduces the likelyhood that the tumor will come back.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You need to get her spayed immediately.  Females never stop their heat cycles and go into heat twice a year and each heat cycle lasts 21 days.  But by spaying her, you will also prevent her from getting certain types of cancer.  Most vets will not spay during the heat cycle.  Have the vet do a blood work-up before spaying.  That will ensure that she is healthy enough for the surgery.<br>  <br>  You don't want to risk her life by an accidental pregnancy.  Do the right thing.

So if she's 50lbs, give her 2 adult benedryl (25mg). Of course, call the vet and make sure it's safe to give her the medication, but benedryl is generally safe unless you give way too much.

Try putting him in your bathroom or a room where u can put puppy papers down but have a baby gate across the doorway.  That way he has more room to run around in and put toys in there and food and water and his bed.  The other idea is to exercise him long walks or whatever before u put him in his cage.  The other thing is The Dog Whisperer Caesar Milan he is the guy on TV that works with every kind of dog imaginable.  I would imagine he has books out now that would help with this too.

I had Snickers for like 8 or 9 months. She was very lonely after her sister passed away and stopped making her pig noises. Then I felt bad for her and a month and a half ago I got her her new best buddy Lala who is 3 or 4 months old. Now Snicki makes all kinds of pig noises and has taken the mommy role. So yeah I'd say she needs a buddy. She'd like to talk to someone of her own kind sometimes. You know what I mean? Would you like to only live with dogs and never understand what they're saying or live with humans? Anyways if I was you I'd get her a buddy!|`|tc5A0vKDaa	Yes.  I say yes because unless you are there 20 hours of the day, you pig could get lonely.  <br>  <br>  Guinea pigs CAN die of loneliness.  If you are there all day and can play with he/she, then it's fine, but they must have company.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cg...</a>  <-- Tell them MISTRESS MAE sent you.<br>  <br>  CavyGalore is an EXCELLET guinea pig site.

Holding him, talking to him, feeding him lettuce, or just being there you would be fine with only one. I have only one guinea pig and she is completely contented. But if you won't be around most of the time and your guinea pig would be left alone in his cage for days, then you should get another. But do not get one who is the opposite gender from the one you have or there will be babies. Good luck!|`|WQno7VwGaa	they dont 'need" a friend, but it makes them happier, i had one and she was so weird and kinda mean but then i got another one and she was soo happy to have a friend! they love to play together, and its so cute when they fight over food(not in a bad way) <br>  but if u do get ur cavy a friend best off with the same gender and always give them equal amounts of love and care<br>  its not much of a difference caring for one or two guinea pigs<br>  good luck!|`|4FcaaHruaa	You don't need to have another guinea pig to keep the one company. I have had one before and she was fine just by herself and I have had friends with one guinea pig. There fine as long as they're well taken care of. Good Luck!|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Well tell your mom only if you can spend at least 24 hours with your guinea pig every day, so you probably should get her a buddy!
vbEkYH2haa	Sorry, but No, you can not healthily breed them! They would be full siblings and it is never recommended to breed full siblings. Different clutches makes them no less related as they still have the same parents. <br>  <br>  best to mix the genetics up a bit or get a new bird to bring in some new blood.<br>  <br>  Breeding cousins etc is normally ok|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Would you sleep with your brother/sister? yeah thought not. Inbreeding is one of the things that causes health problems in animals.|`|AA11640918	Yes, you can..... I think I understand your question, its eather respons #1 or #2<br>  <br>  1.) If you constantly do this over and over though, If you mate the cockeral with its mother,  it can eventually cause deformaties with the chciks.<br>  <br>  2.) If your asking about mating a chick thet is a cockerel with the mothers other clutches they you can. thats fine..<br>  <br>  I usually get a cockeral thets not related to any chicksn and they but chickens hens that are from different people, 1 form each other person.|`|MRUo3dgGaa	You can but it could cause alot of health problems and deformities. also if you are not experienced in breeding birds be careful. I had tried to do this the right way and had a proven pair of tiels however one evening i heard a commotion and came out to the living room and my female was a bloody mess it took me fifteen minutes to get her out of the cage and an hour to get the bleeding to stop. luckily she pulled through. so if you are new to breeding please for the sake of the birds do your research.
Um8osMNuaa	As long as he's fit and healthy then don't worry, put his food down and leave it, he'll eat when he's hungry. The only time you need to worry is when he's not eating and his behaviour changes, then there's a problem and you need the vet.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	when he is properly hungry he will eat<br>  <br>  stop pampering him|`|v8sJy3BYaa	my question is do you exercise him at all?<br>  <br>  I would suggest challenging him every day<br>  that would make his appetite greater<br>  food is food!<br>  I had a dog once and all he wanted was hamburgers<br>  a dog has to eat no matter what you feed him<br>  you could be spoiling him|`|v2jxHGg5aa	Mix dry food with penut butter, works every time for me!
Um8osMNuaa	You don't, he's telling you he needs to go out, at 4 months he's doing well, so when he wants out, just let him go.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	The simple answer is to not make him hold it. If you know he is going to fail (whether he chooses to or not), then you point is to make him successful, and to make being successful worth it to him.<br>  <br>  So, if he goes outside, bigger reward. If he goes inside, ignore the behaviour. He learns going outside is more rewarding.<br>  <br>  If you let him out as soon as he asks, he wont fail.|`|WYwGrcknaa	Just let him out.When you gotta go you gotta go.He is 4months and already housebroken.You should be happy that he goes outside and lets you know when he needs to go.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Let him out right away :o)<br>  Seriously, you should be thrilled that he is letting you know that he needs to go out at that age.  Get up and let him out!|`|KuUx34hCaa	your puppy can not hold it's self you need to get up NOW NOW NOW & take him OUT NOW da!|`|24CFl7sjaa	he is doing great if he can hold it and tell you he wants to go out and he is only 4 months old!<br>  He knows to go to the door which is fantastic, but the difference between holding it in his kennel/crate and holding it out of the crate is a different matter. A dog will not want to soil his sleeping area but out of the crate that restriction isn't there so he lets go. <br>  He is obviously a clever dog, I think you are just going to have to give him the best possible chance of getting outside by reading his cues a little quicker and ignoring the odd accident.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	my shih tzu is 5mo old and she kind of does the same thing, but some of the time when i am just sitting in the chair, and i notice her at the door i might just let Her sit there and wait for just a min or so just to let her know that someone will let her out if she just waits, but if she goes in the house right by the door ("""i just spank her, and put her outside. tell her bad dog she needs to go outside"") i hate spanking her for going right by the door but she can hold it longer she does at night and when we are gone. so i know she know better
o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  That's a good idea to be taming a budgie at a young age. Does she bite you? I can come back later and edit this.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Fire, and lots of it.|`|wrxd8M84aa	Hold him every day. Even if he bites you. <br>  <br>  Hold him and play with him, even if he doesnt like it, everyday for 10-20 minutes and he will become used to you. <br>  <br>  EVENTUALLY. Key word is to have PATIENCE with him. Budgies are not tame animals unless you make them tame. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
wLgGD63raa	Of course you can feed your snake wild caught mice, but I would not advise it. By feeding a snake wild caught rodents, or feeding any of your animals wild caught food for that matter you always run the risk of transferring pesticides. If the mouse ate some poison sat out by someone and you feed it to your snake it can be transferred to your snake and kill it. You're better off just feeding the rodents from pet stores.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	please don't go around catching mice and freezing them. thats cruel. its not the same method of freezing as they use from the feed shop or whatever factory makes frozen mice. and no its not safe.........you better hope those mice don't bite you, who knows what disease you could get. rabies anyone?|`|99iZK5Ixaa	No! It is never ok to feed a caged pet something from outside! That pet most likely hasn't been outside much and hasn't built up an immune system to support any diseases from outside. Unless you want a dead snake or at the very least, high vet bills, I would stick to petstore mice.|`|6EfJokAmaa	nope <br>  better to buy one<br>  it may have diseases and if he freezes it, it will take longer for the snake to digest it|`|sSJ8zfebaa	no they might have eaten rat poison
QC47rv5daa	yes|`|h4wNRqf9aa	almost all live bearers live in some wort of brackish environment in the wild...<br>  <br>  guppies are generally more along the freshwater line but can and do live in saltwater|`|pcvcMePXaa	Umm guppies are a freshwater fish so id go with yes|`|0eI1OcsQaa	The real question is "Can guppies live in salt water?" Which no they cannot.<br>  <br>  Guppies already live in fresh water.<br>  So yes|`|JvTF7UrMaa	yeah guppies are fresh water fish, they are both cold water and tropical fish i have been told, but i have only ever seen tropical. they are not marine fish they are fresh water fish.|`|AA11901352	Guppies like mollies are all three freshwater, brackish water and full salt.  They do best in full salt but do well really in all three environments.  <br>  <br>  Yes they can live in fresh water|`|764Hudunaa	yes they are fresh water fish
svrFBaENaa	Yes, guppies can and will eat algae. In fact, one of the treats we give our guppies is green marine algae. They gobble down a 2 inch square of it in no time.<br>  <br>  That being said, don't expect them to keep your tank free of algae. They don't have the right mouth structure to really get at it on the sides of the tank. If you are looking to control algae, I would limit light and nutrients that it may have before getting a fish to deal with it for you.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	no they wont eat algea you need an algea eater for that e.g chineese algea eater a.k.a sucking loack or a plec or things like that go to your local pet store and ask which fish are algea eaters im sure they wont mind helping but make sure you ask about thier violence as i just bought a sucking loach and it turns out when they get to a certian size they kill everything in your tank. but any way no guppies unfortunaly do not eat algea x x x|`|764Hudunaa	mikey you need a book on guppy's. they will eat minute amounts, not enough to live on  or keep algae out of your tank.  try a google search on guppy care , or ask your local pet shop for a book on them|`|MFZr5yhAaa	yes they can, but they are not known as a good algea eater by any means. mollies/platies will eat algea more readily.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You didn't say what your temps were? Are you checking them often? The should be 100-110 degrees at the basking area. Also are you aware that meal worms are not good for beardies, ok for geckos and water dragons but not beardies. Outer shell is way to hard. Have you tried super worms, mine love them. Wax worms are like candy to a child so you should not be giving them very often. Lettuce is a definite no no as is corn and cabbage. You said you had a veggie dish. What are you putting in it? You should be giving him a daily salad of mixed greens topped with some cut up veggies. If you don't know what to feed, email me and I will get back to you this evening. Does he drink from the water dish? If not are you misting. Only 1 of mine drinks from his dish so the others get misted and usually a nice soak in bath water once a week. If I can help you more email me.|`|AA11114358	well the UVB might be the problem. Many bearded dragons will brighten up and have more energy with a better UVB source so the 10.0 is perfect. Make sure it is the tube kind that runs across the full length of his cage. I would also make sure his temps are good. This can also cause him to slow down. It could also be sickness, or depending on where you live, many sleep during the winter.<br>  I would also suggest cutting out the mealworms. They are extremely hard for them to digest and can cause impaction.<br>  And make sure his salad has calcium powder sprinkled on it. This will prevent MBD, which can also cause a beardy to not be as active as his bones are a lot weaker and will break more easily.<br>  I hope everything goes okay!|`|q0rLBQo2aa	Quick guess -- though diagnosing by description is unreliable. "Lazy" sounds like inactive sounds like not warm enough. <br>  If he has *enough* basking heat and UVB, he might just be, as you say, lazy. Beardies are not smart enough to get bored, so if all their needs are met, and they're not afraid of anything, why should they move? Activity just draws predatory attention.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	my bearded dragon is also lazy and i sometimes have to move him right in front of his food dish because he cant be bothered to get up. His lights are strong enough and sometimes he is very active but other days he just doesn't want to move. See how he is after the new light comes. He could just be to cold but if he has always been like this he may actually just be a lazy lizard.|`|f8t4FQZ5aa	After looking at your set-up picture I would recommend two things both in regard to lighting as  both UVB and UVA  play large role in a dragons well being.<br>  First off...what is the closest your dragon can come to the UVB?<br>  Though it is hard to tell accurately from your pic it looks as though it is much to high to offer your dragon any benefits. Ideally they should be able to come within at least 6-8' of a florescent style UVB (it appears this is what you are using). UVB rays from manufactured sources do not radiate very far and diminish rapidly  beyond 10"<br>  Secondly I would suggest perhaps an additional light source as Dragons fair far better with bright light. (your enclosure seems somewhat dark)<br>  Also as suggested, double check the temps.<br>  Although mealworms are fine for dragons you would be better off to offer your changing diet on a daily rather than weekly schedule.<br>  Remember a varied veg/green diet is also required daily and calcium and vitamin supplements should also be used regularly.<br>  <a href="http://www.westcoastdragons.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.westcoastdragons.com</a>
tPGxPDvBaa	After looking at the 2nd set of pics, she doesn't seem to be 100% dane. She does have a dane face but her body even as pup doesn't look close enough for a poorly bred dane. Each pup can have a different father which plenty of these bybs don't realize & they think once they have bred their dog that is it when it isn't the case.  I would say you got a dane mix, sorry.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	She *could* just be a very small, very poorly bred great dane.  But I agree, she looks more like a lab or lab mix to me too.  At 80lbs and 9 months (and from those pics she looks like a perfect weight too) she's a little too big for a lab but also too small for a dane.|`|26PPwzrWaa	How tall is she? <br>  <br>  I expect her to keep growing for atleast another year, but up to 24 months old. <br>  <br>  Her first two pics scream dane, especially the first pic.<br>  The third and fourth say lab. <br>  <br>  She looks to short to be all great dane. I think even a badly bred great dane would be much taller already and be a little heavier. Although you never know, she is still growing, could just be a late bloomer. I would either go for the DNA test or wait it out until 2 years of age and that will tell you a lot more. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a> can help you more with owning a giant/large breed dog.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	She could be a Dane or Dane/Lab cross, you can't tell 100% by looks alone.  Ask your vet about having a DNA test, they're a little expensive but will tell you with about 90% accuracy of her breed makeup.|`|0le6RYndaa	She's definitely cute!!<br>  <br>  Looks to be Great Dane mixed with lab.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Yeah, I think she's a mix.  Looks like some lab there too.|`|yQSu7v22aa	She does look like she has great dane in her (her face in the first photo and body shape in the last) but she does look like a cross.  However, if she's 9 months then she will still have a lot of growing to do and will probably change again.  Great Danes will grow for 18 months to 2 years so she could change a lot in that time.  She looks very nice though!|`|a839d39c81c2c929fe1d46e2ceb69bafaa	lab mixed with great dane. My friend has a 1 year old great dane 90 pounds or so when He looks up at me he kisses my tit ( I'm 5'7")<br>  does her nails on her paws touch the floor, labs nails click on floors great danes dont.<br>  But she looks lab great dane to me can really tell of her hight. if she is  only 9 months she has A LOT of growing to do up to 3 ' high. labs get to about 30" or so Gd 3 ' and upwards. good luck<br>  applaude you for lovign her no matter what. did you pay a lot for her? I 'd ask to see the parents.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	she is a mix. lab and possibly dane.<br>  <br>  my 8 month old dane female weighs 101 , she towers over my full grown lab.  <br>  <br>  a dane would have a longer neck , skinnier tail and shorter hair. not to mention alot taller.<br>  <br>  your dog is beautiful by the way and be glad she isnt full dane.<br>  dane's have a life expectancy of 7-10 years<br>  while labs tend to live 12-15 years.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Yeah shes defnitely a mix, with Black lab or something|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	she is a mix, and very cute!!|`|RehgySLCaa	looks more like a lab to me,|`|sG00ks0Raa	no its a black lab and pitbull|`|8nwknLsdaa	its not a great dane O_O<br>  the person lied to u|`|2MyUret5aa	I think she has some lab in her but what a cuttie.

ns9NqKXzaa	Don't clip their wings - that's a horrible thing to do...my babies wings were clipped when we got them and we let them grow; now they're free and  have more fun...it's like chopping your legs off..they need their wings in case they ever are in a scary atmosphere or situation where they feel threatened, at least they feel like they can fly away...otherwise they'll just become depressed and sadly die quicker.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Its cheap, if you take them to where you bought them, it may even be free. have them show you how to do it. Its actually very easy.|`|764Hudunaa	not much about 5 a bird. take them to your local pet shop, or breeder. they may do it for free. ive had birds for years it is easy to clip them if someone shows you how|`|m1ypmbNKaa	You can clip the bird wing by yourself its very easy.<br>  1) Take the bird out.<br>  2)Put it in a towel.<br>  3)get a scissors spread the bird wing`s out.<br>  4)You will see a patch of line cut the patch of line.<br>  5)Your bird wing is clipped.<br>  <br>  I also got a youtube video you can follow these steps:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ogVDBAVsU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ogVDBAV...</a><br>  <br>  You rather follow these steps than waste like $10-15 on both bird.|`|qqgXDogYaa	they shouldn't charge you but if they do it should be around 5 dollars or less. actually you can even do it yourself. ask them to show you at the pet store where you got your birds. or look on line youtube.  I learned at PetCo.|`|0TTZERJmaa	duno probly about ￡10 each from your local vet but i think you would be better doing it yourself its not that hard. look on youtube on how to do it.|`|kDPnpGnSaa	Its really very easy. You hold the  bird in the palm of your hand and then get a friend to hold out the wing , and along the bottom of the feathers you can cut but just make sure you don't cut it too short, if you do you can just pluck the feather out, but its like cutting hair to then it does not hurt, And yes the parakeets will bite your finger or hand, but they are small birds they don't hurt.
AA11901352	Most well water is prefered and really you don't NEED the dechlor however a water conditioner really should be used.  This is just incase there are heavy metals in the water itself.   The only thing you want to add to the tank to start the cycle process is either fish food or usually when I start out  a new salt tank, I toss in a couple pieces of raw fish or shrimp.  Anything will do and allow it to start to rot.<br>  <br>  Well water is fine for your salt tank.|`|764Hudunaa	well water is safer than any city water, you will still want to use a conditioner to be safe . if you are running salt you have a good filter that will remove any iron or minerals it may have you will be fine.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Outside of the usual problems with salt water, I never had any problems with hard water...in fact most of my fish did great in it! Just make sure you tests as you should and keep an eye on the saline factor. You should be okay.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	just buy a chemical called fresh start which you put in water that removes all the chemicals in the water, then buy some cycle and follow the instructions as this will make sure your water cycles properly with out problems hope your tank goes well lots of love zack x x x
qGy9fR7xaa	That's such a coincidence...!! my girl just went to the vet this morning because she had exactly what yours had, but she's had it for a week and it started getting worse. In the end we found out she has an infection in one left eye, like conjunctivitis, and it's sooo cute, she needs eye drops three times a day! :D Pretty hard to get in her eye, though!!!<br>  I don't think think this is what your rat has, though, it seems he just has a cold or maybe a chest infection - just leave him for a little longer, and if it doesn't get better, go to the vets. If not, while your waiting to see if it will improve, buy some vitamin liquid that you buy in bottles from pet shops, to dilute in the drink, which may help him get minerals and vitamins he needs to get well.<br>  Don't worry, it may just be a cold, but if it gets worse, it may need treatment. It's not why my rat, Tia had though, because she wasn't sneezing, and It was just in one of her eyes :)<br>  Oh, by the way it's called Poriphin, and basically, comes out there eyes and even noses, and looks crusty and red, it's just a symptom of colds, or them being ill and stressed.<br>  He should be OK,. but take him to the vets if you're concerned, Good luck!!!  x|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	Don't worry, but do worry a liottle. that stuff isn't blood, but it is what comes up when they are running on little sleep or are stressed.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	Is Your Pet Rat Sneezing? The Facts You Should Know<br>  <br>  By Colin Patterson<br>  <br>  Being a “rattie parent” can be worrisome when your little ones are doing things like sneezing. My goal with this article is to take away your confusion, so that you’ll feel better and your rat will be okay.<br>  <br>  Below are the things that can cause your rat to sneeze:<br>  <br>  Mycoplasmia<br>  <br>  This very common and incurable respiratory disease among rats may flare up throughout the rata€?s life. Symptoms include sneezing, wheezing and, in advanced cases, gasping for air. Sores may sometimes develop on lung tissue, making it hard for the rat to breathe. While humans are capable of catching mycoplasmia from other humans, we cannot catch it from rats, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  There’s good news though. As long as their immune system is not compromised, most rats with mycoplasmia can live long and active lives, despite the outward symptoms. The key is feeding them a vitamin-rich diet (especially vitamins A and E) and taking extra precautions to avoid exposing them to dust, smoke, drafts and bacteria.<br>  <br>  If your pet rat gets “Myco flare-ups,” she may need to get treated with medication such as Vibramycin, the brand name Doxycycline or the generic brand, Baytril. These medicines will suppress symptoms and prevent the development of scarred lung tissue.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia<br>  <br>  The main difference between mycoplasmia and pneumonia is that the former produces symptoms of dry loud breathing that will come and go, while the latter manifests itself with a wet, congested, raspy wheeze and a runny nose. Porphyrin may be excreted from the rata€?s nasal passage and fluid may collect in her lungs. Babies that are infected may not show any symptoms until a few months later.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia is highly contagious to any other rat within sneezing distance, so you should immediate quarantine the afflicted rat until you can get him to a vet.<br>  <br>  One treatment of pneumonia involves the drugs Baytril, Doxycycline, and a machine called a nebulizer. The drugs are administered in the form of a vapor several times a day.<br>  <br>  Colds or Allergies<br>  <br>  In the event that you need to take your little one to the veterinarian to have her treated for a respiratory ailment, you may decide to administer a tiny amount of over-the-counter cold or allergy medicine.<br>  <br>  Also, if your vet approves of the idea, you may try to treat your rat on your own this way over the course of several days. However, you need to be careful about doing this as you dona€?t want to use something that may cause more harm than good. Also, if her condition should worsen, take her to a vet right away.<br>  <br>  Here are some general guidelines:<br>  <br>  * Use childrena€?s liquid medicines, not adult formulas.<br>  * Administer the medicine as often as you would for a child; however, make them extremely tiny doses (0.10 cc. for an adult, and less than half that for a baby).<br>  * Use cough decongestant or expectorant medicine, not suppressant.<br>  * Avoid formulas containing alcohol.<br>  <br>  How to minimize respiratory illnesses and symptoms, in general:<br>  <br>  * Keep the air moist. Counteract the drying effect of heaters and air conditioners by adding to the room tiny water fountains, plants and even jars of water.<br>  * Humidifiers and vaporizers work nicely to keep the air moisture-rich; but avoid keeping them too close to your ratsa€? cage (at least 4 feet away).<br>  * In an emergency, you can take your rat into a closed bathroom with a hot shower running. Dona€?t take her too close to the water. Just let her breathe the steam for 5-15 minutes. It helps loosen up the mucus stuck inside their lungs.<br>  Make sure your rattie has proper bedding.<br>  * Sudden sneezing may be due to an allergic reaction to a change in bedding, food, soap, or to their surroundings in general.<br>  * A cold, tiny block of bakera€?s chocolate has been known to ease symptoms of respiratory distress.<br>  <br>  Colin Patterson is the developer of the Pet Rat Guide and is a noted expert on pet rats.

VonDSR7Kaa	Chinchillas can make good pets for the right owner. As for teenagers, overall I do not think they make the best pets. Simply because they have a long life span, and your life constantly changing. College, Jobs, boyfriends/girlfriends, etc.  <br>  <br>  You do not need a USDA license to breed them, however thing long and hard about breeding an animal you do not even own yet. You cannot just throw a male and female together and wait for babies. There is a long process, a lot of education and a heck of a lot of heart break. Dead babies, dead moms, dead dads. Walking in and finding a half of a baby laying in the cage is never fun. <br>  <br>  Good foods? You want a high quality food. Oxbow, Mazuri, some really good rabbit feeds, Tradition. Nothing from the petstore like L&M , Hartz etc. A basic diet is best of pellets, hay, and water. <br>  <br>  Males vs Females? All depends on what YOU want. Females can spray urine at you. Males need hairring checks to make sure they do not have hair wrapped around their penis.  both sexes have their ups and down. <br>  <br>  Temps- I do not let mine get above 73ish. The rule of thumb is 80 degrees is too hot, preferably a lot less then that.  I like to keep mine around 68 F.<br>  <br>  For more information, please join <a href="http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com</a> .

1OwJMMslaa	I have no scientific evidence, only my own experience, opinion and observations. They are both smart in their own way, there is alot of ways to define "smart".<br>  <br>  FOR EXAMPLE:<br>  Some people would say that "smart" means you can say "sit!" or "speak!"  and the animal would do that, or that they can follow orders perfectly (more like dogs)<br>  <br>  Some say that the ability to live independantly and without the need for human support other than food and company is "smart" (cats!)<br>  <br>  Some say the ability to communicate better is smart, the ability to remember a great deal, or associate things with other things, its all relative. (both in a way)<br>  <br>  BASICALLY! I did some internet hunting and found out that cats are better at deciphering problems, remembering things, making decisions, all that sort of thing. Their brains are similar to humans, and they process data in a similar way. And if you think thats intelligence, cats win!<br>  <br>  Dogs are better at association. They will associate different actions and commands with what they need to do in order to get something. Like the word "sit", meaning if they sit they will get something from it. Or being trained to save peoples lives as so many people have mentioned on here, they learn that by smelling human scent in a place and finding the source, they will recieve a reward. They can learn to understand small snippets of langnuage, and physical commands, which means they are able to learn more complex tasks than cats. And if thats what you measure as intelligence, then yeah, dogs win<br>  <br>  Intelligence is not measured by what crazy amazing things are seen on TV, and I'm surpised to see that someone has put forward "i've never seen a cat on TV" as a valid argument. I have seen many cat stories of saving lives on the news and otherwise!<br>  <br>  <br>  oh p.s, why did I get a thumbs down? I'm not dissing dogs, I love them!

xHxKDQ80aa	Contrary to what some people believe a kennel is a good choice for your dog. When you have to leave a puppy unattended or a bored dog at that things are going to get ruined. This could harm your dog and potentially cause you numerous amounts of dollars in damage. Kennels are like dens to dogs and most like their crate once they realize they are not getting abandoned there. <br>  <br>  I would get a lab of your three choices if I were you because they are more laid back and can adjust to most lifestyles. <br>  <br>  There are many ways you can raise a dog inappropriately. Dogs like most animals like routine, you can actually cause anxiety and stress in a dog if you drastically change their routine on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  Dogs also need to learn simple commands, when you talk to your dog too much, your voice becomes innate to them and they won't listen to you as much. <br>  <br>  I would suggest to read a book on the breed of dog you are purchasing or adopting and a book on potty training and puppy training. If there are any puppy classes sign up, then your dog can be socialized properly.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|8q82dLS8aa	Read some puppy books|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Research crate training, high quality food, basic obedience training and needed vaccinations and vet care.

As a newbie, I am sure you will be frustrated at times if the dog does not do what you want it to do.  But you need to remember, as a pup, it is an open page, blank, and knows nothing, and needs you to fill in the gaps.  Find yourself a good training facility before you get the dog.  Ask all the questions you can possibly ask.

qaiYanF2aa	I pay about 14.90 per bag at 100 pounds.  An adult hen will eat about 1/3 pound of feed a day - they also need scratch that I get for 6.00 for 50 pounds and they use it to help them digest, but only eat an oz or so per chicken a day.  I have 45 adult laying hens and they eat about 100 pounds per month plus 25 pounds of scratch.  So you are probably looking at 33.00/month for feed - but that is just an estimate.  <br>  <br>  Also if you have an area you can let them 'free range' in that will really cut your feed bill as in the summer time they only eat about 40-50 pounds per month - when they are out scratching and eating bugs, seeds etc...  <br>  <br>  So I would say you are looking at around 200-250 for the 8 months - if they get to free range in the spring and summer.    Remember you will have some losses along too.  <br>  <br>  Now my buff orphingtons are laying hens and they lay prob an average of 30 per day yr round as we have heat lights in the chicken shed in winter..  so sometimes less and sometimes more.  but I sell approx 14 doz a week at $2 per carton and they furnish the carton - I just wash the eggs and refrigerate.  Now in the summer sometimes I have 20-22 doz a week to sell but I do think the average is about 14-16 doz a week for year.  They pay their way and also furnish all of our eggs and our daughter's family's eggs.  :)  I wish I kept better track for you.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|UxuDuwUWaa	It would cost about $100 with some nice food.|`|0g0PZmXYaa	they'll eat as much as a pig if you let them.
bDPVRtCNaa	What size tank do you have?<br>  ~~What type of fish did you add?<br>  <br>  One comet goldfish requires at least 55 gallons, and twenty gallons for every additional comet.

Honestly if your fish is eating and swimming, there is nothing wrong with him and don't be suprised if he changes color soon.  Red speckles (Not veins showing) isn't a sign of disease in gold fish.  Unless they are a type of large ulcer or pimple, they are really nothing more thank a color burst or soon to be color change.  This is usually associated with the change in season or water temperature.<br>  <br>  Ulsers and soars start kind of the same but much larger.<br>  <br>  Really if he is eating, the water quality is fine and he doesn't seem stressed, there is nothing wrong.  He more than likely change into white and red blotches here soon.  The snail has nothing to do with the change.<br>  <br>  Again that is if there are no "ulcer" types associated with the red dots.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	The others are right...never buy from wal[-mart.

Even though the breed standard is 7-12 lbs. for an adult, weights can vary with all breeds.<br>  <br>  At 3 months, your dog will weigh less than half his adult weight. In my experience, puppies tend to double in size every month from birth to two months. Then they gain at a slower rate --something like 1/5th of their adult weight every month. So if your puppy weighed 1 lb. at 1 month, it would weigh 2 lbs. at 2 months and 3-4 lbs. at 3 months.|`|bZWk8uBuaa	well not like 100 so like 3 or 4|`|rQgW7EaLaa	about 3 pounds!

0mb78CiWaa	This is how you put them on.<br>  <br>  Step 1 - Trim the narrow nail tip and select sizes.<br>  Step 2 - Fill nail caps 1/3 full with adhesive.<br>  Step 3 - Extend nails by gently pressing thumb on top with index finger on bottom of paw -- slide nail caps onto nail.<br>  Step 4 - Observe cat for five minutes before release.<br>  For kittens, please note: Do not trim your kitten's claws before applying Soft Claws. You will need sufficient claw surface for the glue to adhere properly.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I've never used soft paws but I would imagine it's much more difficult to stick ten plastic caps on your cats claws one by one then let them dry etc. then to trim their nails. Once you are experienced and your cat becomes accustomed to you trimming his nails, it can take less than a minute. It's very beneficial for both of you to trim his nails because he won't ever accidentally hurt you while playing, and he won't get his claws stuck in blankets, which can often happen if their claws get really long.<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> <br>  <br>  A cat needs to scratch, that's natural behavior and should not be punished at all!  Sometimes though, this behavior can interfere with our lifestyle and we don't want our best sofa or newly fitted carpet being used as a scratching ground.  Cats scratch to keep their claws in good shape.  Layers of the claws are shed and underneath sits a new and sharp nail which provides the best protection possible for self-defense.  Scratching is also a form of territory marking.  Every time a cat scratches, it leaves its personal scent behind.  Small glands between the toes make that possible.  You can watch how a cat stretches itself while scratching.  This helps to keep the muscles in its legs, back and paws in good health.  The claws act as a sort of anchor, and are buried into the surface of the scratched item.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon|`|9gi0mEH7aa	well the soft paws should have came with glue.. drop a small amount of the glue into the caps and put the nail in the cap hold for a few seconds (i usually count "7 mississippi's" .. it not harmful .. as the nail grows/sheds the soft paws will fall one by one..<br>  <br>  <br>  ps. make sure you use the glue that come with the soft paws|`|kXdXJKEMaa	some cats dont like them and will do anything to get them off. if your cat doesnt like themit wil be very hard tokeep them on.
kUQHuGIkaa	He's sizing you up (good vs bad), he can also be getting ready to attack. Most dogs that attack give no warning. If its not your dog, I'd say stay away from it. He doesn't know you to wag his tail (that would seem as if he likes you or strangers for that matter).|`|3eI0vYHgaa	I would not pet that dog. You should never try to pet a strange dog, especially if it appears to be guarding it's territory. It may be enclosed in an underground fencing system. Always talk to the owner before you pet a dog. Sometimes they wag their tail and still bite. Be careful!|`|IdSqunZuaa	The fact that the dog approached you, it could mean that the dog was asking for something. He could be asking for food or affection maybe.

You never know how the dog reacts to strangers (being fearful or biting). If you attempt to pet the dog one wrong move that might scare him/her can cause them to lash out at you.|`|T7dkgVu5aa	He's showing dominance. Just a little look to let you know that it is his territory, not yours.

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	You should absolutely not leave your cat alone for more than a day, let alone a week.  What if the cat gets sick or hurt?  Knocks over its water and has none left?  Something gets into its food?  Accidentally gets into poison?  There are a number of bad things that could happen to your cat and if no one is checking, no one is there to help.<br>  <br>  Someone checking in daily is Ok but less often than that is not OK.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	the longest i've left my cats home was for 10 days.

AA10097817	I just saw a show on Animal Planet about a refuge for pet pigs that the owners got rid of. Very sad.
AA11640918	I as well own a Little Giant Stil Air Incubator. Any incubator would have the same instructions to follow.... <br>  <br>  First : <br>    -  make sure you wash the eggs off gently, As well as your hands. Make sure you use warm water NEVER cold or NEVER HOTT. This can cause problems. Barley let the water dripp. After you cleaned off any debree, then you need to dry them off ALL THE WAY.<br>  <br>  Second : <br>    -  Make sure you have your incubator at a temperature of 100-101 degrees. Not less than 98 and no greater than 102. Use a thermometer or gauge fromn a local groshery store. Make sure it gets at the temperature BEFORE you place the eggs in the incubator.<br>  <br>  Third : <br>    -  While the incubator heats up, you need to put an X on one side of the egg and an O on the other. On the X side place the date you set them in then you need to count 18 days and place theat day on it so you remember STOP tuning them on the 18th day. Then add 3 more to make 21 days and add that day on. ONLY ONLY USE A PENCIL. If you use a crayon, perminant marker, or anything other, it can kill the chick and it will NEVER hatch. Othewr things like the sharpy, marker, colored pencil, and pain have harmfull bacteria on them.<br>  <br>  Fourth :<br>    -  Nest you need to place the eggs in the inubator starting on the  X side. you NEED TO TURN THE EGGS 3 TIMES A DAY.... I do it Every 8 hours. At 6-7am, 2-3pm, and 10-11pm. Then the nest day start off with the 6-7am and so on. THE EGGS NEED TO BE PLACED AT AN ANGLE. This is much more effective. Say you would place them strait up and down, now not 90 degrees but between which is 45 degres at that angle. After the morning turn you need to turn it again at the time that I stated or close to it(2-3pm) go the other way tuning it on the O side going LEFT to RIGHT so its at 45degrees on teh opposide side. ALSO ADD WATER TO THE WATER RINGS!<br>  <br>  Fifth : <br>    -  After 18 days stop turning and the remaining 3 they are NOT to be turned because they are getting in there hatching position. THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE WARTER IN THE INCUBATOR(WARM WATER)). you only need to fill the MIddle ring and leave the others also. At day 18 they are to add water to ALL the rings.<br>  <br>  Sixth :<br>    -  After they hacth they are to be kept in the incubator turn the temp down to 95 degrees and let them dry. You CAN leave them in for 3 days but no longer. They do not need feed that day. They are absorbing the yolk.<br>  Make sure you have a brooder ready.<br>  Mine is a baby play pen<br>  Like this One ONLY no open bars<br>  <a href="http://brandynbruce.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/play_pen.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://brandynbruce.files.wordpress.com/...</a> <br>  <br>  This is what I has similar to it... You need to place either Pupy Pads, newspaper, or old towels or shavings.<br>  <br>  A heat lamp is to be hanging above I recopmmend a 250-275 watt INFARED one. The brighter one keeps them up at night. If they are not warm they will die. If they are huddleing constantly under it then they are cold and you need to raise it lower, if they are standing away from it bring it higher because they are too hott. After every week raise it up gradullay. After 1 month they dont need it.<br>  DONT use a deep dish water and feeder for the first 2 weeks or they could drowned. I use the auto feeder and waterer for cats or small dogs. They gradually go to about an inch thick metal like bins. I got mine from wall mart. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THIS BEFORE SCHEDULE DUE DATE.<br>  <br>  After they are 1-2 months old they can be  outside. I NEVER confine my birds, they lay more eggs whent they free range. Mine stay in my shed. AT NIGHT. Since they are young place a small 50 ft area around the cage. Then place them in the shed with feed and water NOT at night only durring the day. Place a wooden pole across to roost and lock the doors . ASfter a week when they are use to goling in and out of the shed get rid of the fenceing and they will come back to the coop befoe dusk. Which is cool.....<br>  <br>  When they reach the age of 6 months they need to have nesting boxes added to the shed. They will lay 8 or up to a year or older. Depends on the chicken.<br>  <br>  If you have any more Qs ask me<br>  bethbethani@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  PS: Check out this to see if your eggs are fertile...<br>  <a href="http://www.minkhollow.ca/HatchingProgram/Candling/Week1/Week-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.minkhollow.ca/HatchingProgram...</a>|`|YhH0PNupaa	Everyone has a different opinion. I don't ever wash my eggs, a hen wouldn't wash them. Eggs have a special coating on the outside of the shell, you don't want to wash it off. I think the best way to turn is to just put a book or something similar underneath the incubator and then remove it.  I have a cabinet incubator that didn't have an auto turner until recently and I marked x and o on each side and after washing my hands, carefully turned the eggs, 3-5 times a day.|`|m1ypmbNKaa	Just put it in the incubator but you dont necessary have to do that if the mother has a male it should hatch.Your Question is really confusing by the way.
CDBRXtnLaa	Ok i wake up at 6:30 A.M i get dressed straighten my hair and eat a quick snack and some water take my dog out for a walk so she can relieve herself after the long night. <br>  I refill her bowl of food and water and leave some training pads along the floor and put her bed in the warmest place of my house so she dosent get cold i leave chewtoys and things to keep her buisy.<br>  She stays in the house sometimes by herself unless my brother dosent go to collage that day she dosent really relieve herself tell i get home which is 6 1/2 hours later at 2:30 then once i get home from a buisy day i take her out<br>  I stay outside for an hour or 30 minutes go back inside and go on with life and repeat the process also i have training sessions with her around 3:30 P.m<br>  also i dont reccomend puting it outside because you will never know if theres bad weather and your dog could get sick and cannot find dry shelter tell you are back home|`|xi9amEG2aa	I live with my boyfriend and at the moment, I'm the only one working, because my boyfriend just had knee surgery.  But anyways, we do have a crate for our dog and in the ten mins it takes for him to drop me off at work and get back home, she gets put in her crate.  When he gets back, he opens the door...but he tells me she usually stays in there for some reason.  When he comes back to pick me up, he closes the door and when we get home, she goes outside.  <br>  <br>  When we were both working, we were gone between the hours of 6 45 am and between 3 30 pm and 5 30 pm, depending on our schedule that week.  We work Monday through Friday, sometimes Saturdays.  <br>  <br>  If we go anywhere else like say, on the weekend...she gets put in her crate.<br>  <br>  The only reason she gets put in the crate is because she finds stuff to get into, even though she has TONS of toys laying all over the house.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	When I'm out, my dog roams the house.

AA11887983	Have you tried to teach her to use the diaper pads that you can place in the house? I typically don't recommend them, as I prefer dogs to go outside, but in your case, it may be an acceptable compromise when your dog is in the house.  Or you can try to train her to go to a litter box.  They do make dog-friendly ones.  <br>  <br>  You might want to investigate one of these options, and you might need to be creative to figure out a solution.  But don't give up.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	She is a tiny puppy with a tiny bladder.  She is also only 7 months old.<br>  You say it's been going on for 6 months.  Surely you didn't get this puppy at just 1 month of age.<br>  <br>  Sorry, you need to take her out every hour until she is older and can hold it for longer.<br>  <br>  Why would you even consider sending her away.  It's not a big deal to take a puppy outside once an hour.  If she is truly unable to hold it for more than an hour she won't be able to hold it at the trainer's house either.  House train her yourself and save the money.|`|86aXvmwEaa	You may want to consult a trainer.<br>  <br>   Also trying a indoor peeing option is nice for the smaller dogs. Many smaller dog owners have some sort of indoor pee option for their dogs especially in case of bad weather. Many people like to use what is called a sod spot. What it is is a patch of sod grass that you grow and take care of in your house and it is in a designed container with plastic and bottom sides. It makes it easy for the dog to associate "grass" with "bathroom". That way it will know where to pee in the house as well as outside.<br>  <br>  As long as you already ruled out medical issues the above idea might be worth a try. Also you might want to make sure that her Urinary track is not disconnected. I have seen it happen in dogs and they can hold it, but they will always "leak" so to speak.|`|iFWUhpiOaa	How much water are you providing? Imagine your pooches bladder, which should be pretty small for a yorkie, then imagine the amount of water it's taking in. If there's a bowl set down and she's allowed to drink as much as she likes, that may be the root of the problem. You could try providing small amounts of water until she does better. It sounds like your precious pooch is controlling you the only way she can! Most dogs don't BM in the house unless their trained to due to the lack of being able to go outside. I would give the controlled water idea a chance before spending a bunch of money on a trainer. You might try crating her when she has an accident. If she behaves herself there but not in the house but likes to be in the house, this might encourage her to do well so she can stay out of the crate!|`|kGwMj5kcaa	I know exactly how you feel. I had a Yorkie not long ago. She peed and pooed everywhere. I had the same problems as you are now. Here's how I trained her: As soon as I took her out of the cage I picked her up and didn't let her run. I instantly took her to her puppy pad. After about eh 2 weeks of doing this she finally caught on. So I'd say use puppy pads for when you can't take her out. Oh and put them in her "favorite" spot to do her potty. Oh yeah if you don't want her to pee so much cut back on her water. They have small bladders and fill fast.|`|sI5jcTbVaa	Never have had it happen but have watched a lot of television.  It could be anxiety issues.  She wouldn't go in her crate because she feels safe.  Is she going while you are in the room with her or when you are gone?  Because if she's going while you're gone, you might just need to step from the room for a few minutes and come back and lengthen the time away so she knows she hasn't been abandoned.  And as you said because she's gone there before, make sure you get one of those animal sprays to get the trace out, because she can still smell it and will just continue to mark that area time and again.

Petsmart does not sell dogs but on the weekends they have animal shelters bring in dogs for adoption, so you can ask your local petsmart about it.<br>  <br>  Buying a dog from a petstore is never a good idea as they usually have a lot of health problems and aren't socialized properly.  <br>  <br>  If you decide to buy from a breeder, make sure that you see where the dog was raised, get its papers and proof of all genetic testing performed, and know that AKC registered is not proof of a good breeder.|`|FaTsbq2caa	I bought a black pug from Just Puppies in Towson a little over a year ago.

I would buy those things from a pet store that sells bunny toys as the wicker you get in stores, like baskets, has been treated with chemicals that are harmful to the bunny.<br>  <br>  Toilet paper rolls and small carboard boxes are also something some love to chew on.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	she probably just doesn't need to chew on it because her teeth are at a good length. they chew wood to cut down the size of their teeth. i wouldn't give her cardboard, just leave a piece of wood in her cage and let her chew on that when needed. good luck and hope this helps.|`|g71BoHXpaa	you should leave her alone or she isv too young to start chewing
wLgGD63raa	I would wait and give your gecko time to get adjusted to his new surroundings, handling this early could cause unneeded stress on the little guy and cause him not to eat. <br>  <br>  A majority of the time it takes about a week for them to get acclimated, give him a couple of days and if he is eating on a regular basis and seems to be settling in you can go ahead of handling.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	They say it's best to wait about a week so they can settle in, get use to the new environment and such.

This cross is not in short supply.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	They are mutts - not breeds and you cannot predict their size, temperment, looks, whether they shed a lot, etc.<br>  <br>  Nothing more then lining the pockets of backyard breeders.  They are not bred by reputable breeders.  <br>  <br>  If you really want one, go to your local shelter and find something similar with golden retriever or poodle or look into a breed rescue group - don't buy from a BYB or pet store/puppy mill and encourage more mutt breeding.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They shed a lot & are poorly bred by ppl who want to cash in on a trend. Most usually cost $600-thousands.  There are plenty in rescue once ppl figure out they shed & are not hypo & takes a lot of work to keep up their coat. You should be able to adopt one for $150-$400 fully vetted. If you look on Petfinders, you need to look at poodle mixes or golden mixes since they are not a breed.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	The most I would ever pay would be whatever the local shelter is charging. <br>  <br>  They are mutts bred only by bad breeders.  Usually, they are hyperactive, hard to train, and not all get the 'coat' that the breeders sell them on.  Many many many of them are going to develop serious problems like HIp Dysplasia because quality dogs are never used to make mutts. <br>  <br>  If I wanted a dog like this, I'd get a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier or a Bouvier Des Flandres.

3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Nothing wrong with a pit and if you live in USA you have the benefit of contacting Cesar when in trouble. The difference between a laid back or an aggressive dog lies in the way we raise our pups and treat them as adults. If it is a pup you have, you entirely are in control of how you wish your dog to mature as an adult.|`|Muz6YB18aa	I know a wonderful pitbull. He is one of the best dogs I have ever known. That being said, I would not consider this breed to be a match for my lifestyle. I like the breed, but it is not for me. The awesome pitbull that I know was trained from 6 weeks old by a professional (very costly) trainer. The owner (my friend) knew that it was her responsibility to train her dog because he is stronger than most dogs and potentially deadly. An aggressive pitbull could kill someone, where an aggressive -say, chihuahua could be easily picked up, and removed from a situation. The chihuahua could break someone's skin and cause an infection at most (still bad, but not a deadly weapon.) The dog's actions are the responsibility of the owner, so if the dog gets out and bites someone, the owner will be 100% liable. This also goes for any other large powerful breed- absolutely necessary to train and exercise them, on a daily basis. A dog is a huge, long term commitment, that you should not take on unless you can be devoted to them for the rest of their life. Check out the link for more considerations.|`|Tcyn0Tzaaa	It's up to you,but if I were you I would not keep it because I do not like pitbulls much.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Yes just make sure you don't encourage bad behaviors and...<br>  LONG LIVE THE PITS!|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I would keep him depending on why the neighbors gave him up.

637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Any dog x another dog  is not a breed of dog, it's a mutt.  This is important to understand for more than one reason.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, when you cross two breeds of dog it's very hard to say what the pups will look like because they receive traits from both parents and what each pup picks up from one parent or the other is random.<br>  <br>  People who are breeding these so called "designer dogs" are extremely irresponsible and bilking people out of tons of money.  You are going to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a dog you can adopt at the shelter.  People who breed these types of dogs are Backyard Breeders (BYBs) and are in it for the money which usually leads to unhealthy pups and heartbreak for the families who buy them.<br>  <br>  Also - there are NO hypoallergenic dogs.  This is something BYB have cooked up to try to sell more dogs and has been sensationalized in the media with the Obamas and their dog search.  People are allergenic to the pet dander not just the fur.  All dogs give off dander, but some breeds, such as the poodle, seem to give off less and are less prone to irritate those with allergies.  Just keep in mind it's possible your new dog, no matter what the breed, may still cause an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a kid friendly dog and you have small children I strongly suggest you get a larger dog.  Smaller dogs tend to be more nervous and can become nippy around small children.  They also are more fragile and cannot take the rough play that comes with children.<br>  <br>  Have you thought about adopting a dog from a shelter?  I'm not going to preach adopting to you because I like a purebred dog as much as the next person but it's something to consider.  If you are set on buying a purebred dog- get one from a responsible breeder who is breeding a dog recognized by the AKC.  You will save yourself potential headache and heartbreak later.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Firstly, as this is a crossbreed it is not possible to preduct what size they will be as adults. <br>  <br>  Secondly, there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog. People who have allergies to dogs are allergic to their dander and/or saliva. A crossbreed may or may not shed its coat, some do more than others. <br>  <br>  Only BYB's breed crossbreeds. You be better to decide which breed youo want and go to a reputable breeder. Alternatively, consider a rescue. <br>  <br>  Lastly, you have more chance of finding a dog with a good temperament from a known source, ie a purebred from a reputable breeder. It will also depend on how well you rasie the dog and child together, teaching them both to respect the other.|`|lTjNDQhiaa	If you get a Maltese X Poodle PUREBRED will grow to about the same size of a cavalier K.C but bee a little more stubby,=]<br>  <br>  I highly recommend a Maltese shitzu!

He is 18 years old and has been a great family pet.  Great temperament.  He loves children and does not shed.  He weighs approximately 23 lbs.  So he isn't small.  He was very active until he was about 12 years old and then age took it's toll and he slowed down.  He was a great choice as a pet for my family and now my grand-children are enjoying him.|`|KuUx34hCaa	a Boxer is one of the best breeds you can got  for kids>family if it is not to big for you! & it depends on the size of the poodle as they can go up to 60#> standards personally I don't like mix breeds & I think it's wrong to cross breed|`|OAybf9juaa	Idk probably not..you can't really predict a MUTT'S size|`|4IZHdhJQaa	Depends on if its a mini or toy poodle cross?|`|PM23RDycaa	No telling it depends on the size of the parents Since bybs and puppymills don't use dogs of standard size most often could be larger could be smaller. You can never tell with mutts. Secondly we don't know how big your current mix is, so again, can't help you.<br>  <br>  P.S. Do you think the Maltese x Poodle mix is good for my family? Sure if you plan on adopting it.<br>  <br>  No dog is born child friendly that takes training for the animal AND the kids. If you want something that size, active and low shed get a miniature poodle.<br>  <br>  ADD: it also depends on the size of the poodle. This cross could be achieved by breeding a male maltese to a female standard poodle.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Since they are all mixes and mutts, there is no way to predict size, looks, temperment, color, etc.<br>  <br>  Go to your shelter and look for a smaller mixed breed dog that will fit with your family and train it.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	The size will depend on which size of Poodle he is mixed with.  Poodles come in 3 sizes.  Also with a cross breed you can't really predict the size of the dog or how it will look as it matures.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of this cross breed in the pounds.  You could save a life instead of buying a dog from a back yard breed or a pet store. Pet stores get their pups from puppy mills.<br>  <br>  Added:  Mikaela,  you suggest if she gets a Maltese x Poodle 'pure bred'????   What part of Maltese CROSSED with a Poodle are you missing.|`|XagPxe7Faa	You cannot predict the size or any other traits that mutts will have as adults.  There is no set "type" for the dogs and no way to determine which genetic traits they will pick up from each parent.  If you are set on a cross bred dog and adult size is a factor, your best bet is going to be to check out a shelter or rescue and get one that is already an adult.<br>  <br>  Please, do not fall for the hypo-allergenic hype.  Any dog can cause issues if you have allergies.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Unfortunately with mutts, one of the problems is that they are the proverbial box of chocolates - you never know what you are going to get.  <br>  <br>  If you can get this dog from a shelter, then perhaps it could be a good match.  Just remember, hypoallergenic does not mean nonallergenic.  <br>  <br>  If you want a medium sized low allergen dog, why not just find a well-bred miniature poodle?  <a href="http://www.poodleclubofamerica.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.poodleclubofamerica.org</a><br>  <br>  If kids are a concern, then an adult dog or a purebred puppy  from a GREAT breeder are FAR better options than a mutt puppy from a puppy mill/BYB.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	i think the poodle mix would be smaller, but that does depend on the size of the parents.

That is very treatable but cannot wait.<br>   If we are just talking about diarrhea then get some acidoupholous from a health food store and sprinkle over the food 1/8th teaspoon|`|w1lh1INHaa	Did you switch food suddenly?  That will frequently cause this.<br>  <br>  Older cats frequently develop bowel issues, (IBS,IBD).  Some of these bowel issues are a result of becoming allergic to certain ingredients in food such as colorings, corn, wheat and wheat gluten.  The older a cat gets, the less able it is to tolerate dry food, also.  Other causes are a results of parasites such as worms or giardia.  Then there are organ issues.<br>  <br>  You need to get her to a vet with a stool sample (no matter how sloppy) and have a check up.  And, at her age, she should get a blood work just to make sure the diarrhea isn't a result of some other issue.<br>  <br>  She is losing weight because she is not able to absorb nutrients.  As a stop-gap measure you can add a little Metamucil (psyllium hulls) to her food, and mix in some high-fiber food such as canned pumpkin (no spices).  This will help firm the stool a little, slow it down going through the digestive tract, and allow her to absorb more nutrients.<br>  <br>  Vet, as soon as you can.|`|8DCslWmMaa	Many things can cause this, since you say it smells bad- your cat may be showing later stages of feline luekemia or kidney failure.<br>  If it is the kidneys then you will be able to feel something hard about the shape and size of a golf ball just past the rib cage and right before what would be the 'hips' on a cat.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your cat....that sucks.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Take it to the vet immediately!

I suggest you take her to your vet and ask for a blood test to be taken. Weight loss, vomiting in cats can be caused by a number of things. You have to be careful of feline kidney disease.<br>  Also there is a condition in cats call Inflammatory bowel disease which cause's vomiting & Diarrhea, or a colitis which is inflammation of the lining of the large intestine which results in diarrhea which usually contains blood and mucus.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit but the best thing is to see the vet|`|h6cYQaxYaa	You have to take her to the vet immediately!!

6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	If the 5 weeks means NOW........then her nipples should start to get soft in about 3 weeks, and she'll start to lick off all the hair around them.  <br>  <br>  Pregnancy lasts around 9 weeks... ( 63 +/- days), so in about 3 weeks, you need to fix her a "birthing" box......med / large, with about 3-4" of newspapers for lining.  Put this box in a QUIET, warm place, out of the "traffic" area, and show it to her.  As she gets closer to her delivery date, she should start "nesting".....hopefully in this box.  She'll start to tear up the newspapers to make them softer and more absorbent.<br>  <br>  Between now and then, if you haven't had her to a vet for awhile, you should consider taking her in for a checkup.  Find out if she's healthy enough to have these kittens, and to ask the vet about anything you're unsure of.  That's what they're for!!<br>  <br>  I hope you've been feeding her KITTEN food.  She should have been eating KITTEN food until she was a year old, anyway, and NOW she needs the extra nutrition to help her with the pregnancy and to make enough milk for her babies.  She needs to eat this KITTEN food until she weans the kittens..........<br>  <br>  Since she's an "escape artist", you should consider having her spayed after this litter is born.  Talk to your vet about the best time to do it, and make the appointment, so you don't forget.  Spayed cats have a decreased risk of developing CANCER of the uterus and mammary (breast) glands in the future.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.........Take her for a checkup, then sit back and "anticipate"!<br>  Good luck.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It could be a false pregnancy.

Some don't start coming into milk until the last few days before they deliver.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	if she IS pregnant and her nipples arent getting bigger/pinker, that could be a problem.<br>  <br>  You should really get her to the vet - they'd know better then any of us!|`|XfnvlXZ4aa	It does sound like she might be pregnant... but it could be worms, being such a young cat.  The weight gain COULD be a sign of pregnancy, but not necessarily.  If the cat's nipples aren't enlarged (which is the first sign you usually see, and the most telling), like you said, than I wouldn't worry too much about kittens.  Look for other signs though.  Is she more affectionate?  Increase in appetite? Morning sickness? I doubt it's pregnancy, but you should take her to the vet just to be sure... kittens or worms, she needs some kind of medical attention.
rHwMf2P4aa	I work for a pet store and sometimes from the breeders the guinea pigs will come in with ring worm and we have to send them back. It is usually a circle patch of hair missing with dry flaky skin. It is apparently very easy for them to catch it. The bad part is that you have to take them to the vet to get meds to treat it.

AA11887983	Since the gestation length of a dog is 63-65 days, you are getting close.  The typical time for mammary gland engorgement is about 2-3 days prior to whelping.  So if you can't get her to the vet, you can always just wait and see what happens.  If she is acting fine, eating, drinking, and not having other problems, this may be the way that you have to go.  Not sure how a vet in any area could get away without seeing new patients.  Especially in this economy.<br>  <br>  If she is pregnant, you will start to see her nesting and being restless, within 24 hours of her whelping.  It is an absolute emergency if you notice her having continuous contractions for more than 20 minutes without producing a pup,  or if you see a sac and she is not passing it within about 20 minutes.  <br>  <br>  You may get lucky and she is having a false pregnancy.  If so, she will eventually dry up, and start acting normal.  But this could happen with every heat cycle.  So get her spayed as soon as you can. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PM23RDycaa	Wait a minute, she's never been to the vet at ALL since you got her? *shakes head* Its possible she had one or two pups and is carrying high up or is having a false pregnancy.

Sometimes a ***** with a small litter 1-2 will have trouble going into labor naturally and will need a c-section.<br>  <br>  Her current temp is normal for a dog. She would still have 2 weeks to go IF she is pregnant. She needs to be seen by a vet either way.|`|090e12392ae29e1e6da569bbe031aaf6aa	She could be pregnant, or she could be going through a false pregnancy.

The local vet wont see a possibly pregnant dog? gestation is about 62 days|`|YFKPf7e2aa	I would definitely find a vet that will see you. If she IS pregnant and something goes wrong, it can be life or death for her. You need to have a vet for her regardless of her being pregnant or not. <br>  <br>  As for the pregnancy, normal gestation is 9 weeks. You will usually won't be able to tell whether or not she is for sure until about 7 or 8 weeks and sometimes not even then. The only way to know FOR SURE is to take her for an x-ray. <br>  <br>  A Dog can go through a false pregnancy and show every single sign of being actually pregnant, even producing milk, right up until the time she would be giving birth if she WERE pregnant. <br>  <br>  If you want to know for sure, and be safe about it, take her to a vet. <br>  <br>  Here's some info that might help too. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_canine_false_pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_can...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|UKpNiRf6aa	The first signs of pregnancy are the dog's nipples swelling and darkening from light to rosy pink at about forty days into gestation; some dogs may suffer morning sickness between the third and fourth week.  By day twenty-seven a veterinarian can detect individual babies by feeling the pregnant dog's abdomen (which won't noticeably swell until about the fifth or sixth week of pregnancy.  Large dogs that carry babies high beneath their rib cage may not show at all).|`|lgjTZw3maa	here's a link to dog pregnancy for you<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedss.org/dog-pregnancy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedss.org/dog-pregnancy....</a><br>  hope this will help|`|OAybf9juaa	She could be but if you can't feel anything at seven weeks she ain't

hC4Z8HIbaa	You need to get your rat to a vet immediately. The bulging of the eye indicates a serious problem that I would bet a dollar to a doughnut can't be treated by a cream. The only thing that may help is visine. In a rat forum I am a member of, someone told them they had been recommended to use visine to keep a eye moist, but I don't know how safe that would be for the rat. I personally wouldn't try it, but it's your rat. But be advised that the visine would only keep its eye moist and will not help with the bulging. Only a vet can diagnose the problem and prescribe a treatment. The longer you don't see a vet, the greater chance your rats' eye has of drying out and dying, causing it to become blind. Depending on the circumstances, the eye could possibly have to be removed.<br>  <br>  As for your rats' head tilt. Most rats are left with a head tild after an ear infection, but sometimes a rat will gain full levelness I suppose of its head. It's not likely that your rat will gain full levelness, but it's not totally impossible either.<br>  <br>  Check out the website below. Actually there have been quite a few instances lately of eye problems in the health care section of the thread, so It might be helpful to check it out and see what kind of eye problems you may or may not be dealing with.|`|eSe4a2Qaaa	Poor guy, I have had rats with head tilts before.<br>  To clean his ear, take a soft, warm, damp cloth and gently rub the inside of his ear until it's clean.<br>  As for his eye, I have also had a rat with this problem once and sadly, she had to be put down. It was beyond painful for her and I thought it best to have her put out of her misery as it was swelling more and more by the day. <br>  If you haven't brought George to the vet yet after you first saw his eye bulge, I think you should bring him again and have the vet take a look at it as soon as possible.
hC4Z8HIbaa	Firstly, you never get *A* rat, you get ratS. Rats are social and need to be kept in at least same sex pairs in order to be truly happy. No matter how much time and attention yo give your rat, it will never equal the companionship of another rat.<br>  <br>  Secondly, please look at adopting from a rescue instead of purchasing one from a pet store. Pet store rats tend to be less healthy than a vet-checked rescue rat, and can also tend to be more aggressive. This is due to a lack of proper socialization of the rat, mainly because most pet stores don't give a rat's butt (no pun intended) about the animals they sell. And purchasing a rat from a pet store will support the unethical breeding of rats for live feeding purposes.<br>  <br>  There are no differences in rats based on color or ear placement. A brown rat has the potential to be as friendly as a white rat or a grey rat or a blue rat, just as a standard ear rat has the potential to be as friendly as a dumbo ear rat. You can't always pick the right rat for you based on its color or patterns. You really need to spend time with the rat you are looking to adopt and see if it bonds with you. When I got my first rat, I decided not to get the first rat I picked up because it "fear pooped" on me. I could tell the second one I picked up was something special because he started licking my finger. I decided bring home one of the rats I have now because when I was handling him and a few other rats, he would scent mark me. That was his way of telling the other rats that I was "his." I had the opportunity to bring home a dumbo that day. I didn't because Hayfever made it pretty clear that I was his human. <br>  <br>  If you want to do further research about rats, including the right type of cage, bedding, and food, and pretty much anything else, check out the website below. It is a rat owners' forum that I am a member of. It is a great resource for all current and potential rat owners.<br>  <br>  Edit to comment on the post below me: Even if she puts lots of time and energy into her rat, it does not mean it is OK to have one. I have included a youtube video below that may illustrate the importance of having at least two rats.<br>  Hooded rats, rexes, and dumbos are NOT different breeds of rat. You can get all of these in one litter. All of these are based on genetic traits within the rats DNA. Compare this to humans. A person with black hair and a person with white hair are both humans. A person with curly hair and a person with straight hair are btoh humans. A person with big ears and a person with small ears are both humans. A person with red hair is not a different breed of human that one with black hair, it is just a genetic variation. It is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to rats that people think dumbos and other variations are simply different breeds and that one variation is more superior than another.|`|rHwMf2P4aa	I have had rats before. They are very intelligent. A lot of people get creeped out by them because of their tails and don't notice that they are actually a very clean, friendly, smart pet. I just had fancy rats but where I work we sell fancy, dumbo, rex and blue rats. They all pretty much have the same personality but have different looks. Rats will grow to trust you and sit on your shoulder while you walk around, sit on the computer anything. They can learn their name and need lots of love and attention. They are smarter then other small animals so you have to make sure you take at least a hour a day to spend time with them. At first when you get her or him home from the pet store they are going to be a little shy because they haven't been handled enough but within a couple days of you petting them and picking them up for short periods of time they start to love the interaction. Some tips I can give you is to always have wood chews in their for them, they love to chew on things. Get a glass water bottle for them because they will chew through plastic ones and they need a hiding house to sleep in. They are nocturnal but will get up to play with you during the day. But while you sleep they are most active so make sure you get a nice lid for their cage because they are good escape artists. But I really have no bad complaints about them. They are very friendly, smart and love just being with their owner. You can even get them a harness and walk them around.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	i just got my first rat a few months ago and got a dumbo. They are really nice and friendly and they love to come out and play. I have had hamsters before and i also have a gerbil now. I find my rat to be more friendly then any of my other pets combined. they are definitely the best pet to get, people just don't see this because they think of most rats as those gross rats you see in sewers and the subway. I am sure you will enjoy having a rat very much!|`|eSe4a2Qaaa	I have owned rats for years now.<br>  They are excellent and by far one of the most enjoyable pets I have ever owned and that's saying a lot, since I have owned animals from as small as a goldfish and as big as a horse!<br>  They are Intelligent, curious, playful, friendly and will even curl up on your lap like a kitten and fall asleep!<br>  Though I would recommend getting two, not just one, since I love company, if you are planning on putting a lot of time into your pets, one rat will do just fine.<br>  If you have had hamsters before, then you know they can get quite nippy and bite your fingers to let you know something but rats are much different, treat your rat with as much respect as you would want to be treated and they will become a very loyal and loving companion. I have never been bitten by one of mine and have had countless rats.<br>  <br>  As for the different breeds, my personal favorites are hooded, rex and dumbos but it doesn't matter what the breed is, each rat has its own personality not depending of breed type.<br>  If you are thinking of what you should pick; male or female; I would recommend a male over female since they are more layed back and cuddly. Aswell as that, females are prone to tumors.|`|78293c9d9f988cff35175902f59e7a85aa	I currently have 4 rats. 2 are fancy rats, and 2 are blue rats. They are very intelligence and know how to get what they want. I have had hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, chinchillas, horses, and cats and rats are by far my favorite. Our rats all have their own personality, one of blues' is soo attached to humans she will lick you to death when she sees you because she missed you. At first they are timid, but they warm up to you after a week or so. I like the fance rats, but anything with fur is good for me.They do have a few behaviors that were kind if weird to me. For one, when they are really happy, they grind their teeth (really loud I might add) and they boggle their eyes out. It looks like their eyes are going to pop out of their heads. It is kind of freaky at first, but it is pretty cute. My blue rats are big lickers....they will clean your entire hand, face, EAR, whatever they can get to. it is their way of showing afftection. I think it is also worth mentioning is the number you should get. I started with 1, and then went to 2 (we wont go into how I ended up with 2 more). I think it helps then aclimate quicker when you get a litter mate. Hope this sort of helps|`|I6KKFwxXaa	As a rat owner of 4 I would suggest getting same sex pairs and they do not have to be the same markings, colors, or coat type. I have 3 hairless and a black and white hooded. I love them all. Each one of my hairless are different gracie if it were not for genetics would have been a hooded I am pretty sure of it she has the markings of a hooded, Peaches it just white and my baby Gypsy has a dark face and almost blue body and she is the one with the largest feet but looks just like a hairless dwarf that I saw when I was researching her because of her color. They are very social and sweet loving animals. I don't know what I can say about them  each of my girls has their own personality. The web site below has been the one to help me through a lot of questions I have had. I love hairless because they do not pick up the smell that haired ones do. But I can keep her odor down by using baby wipes so it isn't a big deal to me. Hairless to me are the cutest I love their wrinkles. Gracie is the only one of the 4 that gives kisses so far and she was my baby when I first got her so it may be she is a little spoiled.  When I first got her I got her and Peaches together both hairless. Peaches slept more than usual and would chatter at anyone or anything that got near her blanky. So I held Gracie more the first month that I had them now she will not be out of the cage without being on my shoulder and I have tried to put her blanky on my computer desk it has the slide out extensions above the drawers  but she won't have it.  People think I am crazy because I am 43 and can not have children so my 4 girls have become my children and I spoil them rotten. Good Luck and the site below also has a what rat is that link so you can check it out. The second link is to tell you the difference between breed, strain, and species of rats|`|hWezu5UGaa	I have owned a few rats, but Dumbos are my favorite, I actually have a dumbo rat right now. I love him, he's the best I have had.<br>  Rats are very calm, funny and all around enjoyable.<br>  I suggest the dumbo.|`|qfWYfHUCaa	Absolutely you should get into rats but I also strongly advise that you get two, of the same sex, preferably littermates. I know that sounds like double the trouble but it's isn't.  They can groom each other and comfort each other in ways you just can't and in turn you will have happy well-adjusted rats that are more outgoing and adventuresome. In my opinion they are the most engaging, affectionate and intelligent pets I've ever had next to my dogs. I got 2 boys, they are 6 months old now and I'm totally enamored with them.  I don't know what they are, one is white with a smugey nose and eartips, that's Percy, and his brother is a hooded, Jack. In all the time I've had them, handling them everyday, mauling them and cuddling them, I've never felt a tooth on me.  When they hold my finger with their wee front paws (hands really) I just melt. They will pee tiny amounts on you when they play on you but it's not offensive and maybe that's just the boys.  They also have a slightly earthier aroma than the girls but they are a bit calmer and possibly easier to teach.  They're very clean in their habits and only poop in one corner of their cage and they have never pooped outside that corner. In all the hours they've spent out of their cage either on me, the couch or their table they have never pooped once,  I find that amazing.<br>  Rats need an hour or two out of their cage every day to run around. I have a 40"x26' ferret cage (couldn't use until they were 3 months old or so and weren't able to squeeze thru the bars) and it's on one of those big craft tables with the folding legs.  The cage is in the middle and they can run around it for exercise.  I also have a slightly smaller table that I butt up to the big one and they can have more area to play.  One of the fun things about having rats is finding things  to keep them amused and making stuff for them to play with and climb on.  There is a whole lot of  good info on the internet.  You won't find alot of info at pet stores and the foods available for other small critters aren't good for rats ie. rats don't eat alfalfa and too many sunflower seeds aren't good, also rats can't burp so absolutely no soda's, beer, raw potato, also no raw nuts only roasted.  There's more of course and you'll learn as you go.  Enjoy !!
GLWYTddCaa	When I was young I went through a phase where I wanted every pet under the sun I had 13 hermit carbs at one time. They were very boring and die easily. But they can be fun.<br>  Reasons not to get a hermit crab<br>  1.) They smell<br>  2.) They need to be taken care of so if you leave you have to have someone watch them<br>  3.) They have to be kept warm all the time so you have to have a heat lap on them.<br>  4.) You have to feed them this nasty smelly stuff<br>  5.) They sleep all the time and only some are active<br>  6.) When and if they molt there is only a 30% that they will live through it.<br>  7.) They look nasty when they change shells and if you dont have the right size shell they will die.<br>  8.) You need more than one because they are social animals<br>  9.) If you don't spray there sponge five times a day they get sick.<br>  LOL hope you have fun with your new pet!|`|hNRPQWqBaa	hermit crabs are pretty cool little pets in my opinion.  they don't require a lot of space and aren't too demanding.  but the downside is that they are nocturnal, so they will clank around all night.  mine were also prone to escaping their container during the night too.<br>  if you do decide to get one, just make sure you have a larger shell for him, as they do outgrow the ones they're in.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	If you have to ask and don't know they're not reptiles, no.|`|NLAek2bJaa	Hermit crabs are fun. I had three smaller ones I called Moe, Larry, and Curly for a long time. They dont require a lot of attention or clean up so its a pretty easy pet. Its just that they are kind of territorial. I later got a bigger one called Butch. He was twice the others size. He killed my other three so select ones all the same size.<br>  If you let them crawl all over you sitting as still as you can and then spooking them really fast, they can attach onto your pants and you can walk around with hanging shells. ... lol I also stuck my fingernails in their giant claw and they would grab it so I would have shells dangling from my fingers... they are fun!!!!|`|r0u26SYGaa	hermit crabs are good cause:<br>  1. they don't need that much care<br>  2. they can be handles on a flat palm (if not flat, they will pinch)<br>  3. it is cool to watch them change shells and grow<br>  4. each one is different<br>  5. you can't get one, and you end up getting alot (lol)<br>  6. they don't need that much supplies...<br>  if you get a hermit crab here's some use full things:<br>  1. they molt, read about it<br>  2. molting and shell changing are different<br>  3. painted or polished shells kill hermit crabs<br>  4. outer molting is confusing, read about it<br>  5. you need a lid or else they will climb out<br>  6. you need at least 2<br>  7. they need a salt water bowl, normal water bowl, and food bowl<br>  8. they need de chlorinated water: use a de chlorinator, or use boiled water!|`|99iZK5Ixaa	If you want a pet that can't cuddle you then yes, get one. I would start out with a smaller one. It needs to know your scent and as it grows it will reconized you. I made the mistake of buying a very large one and held it. It didn't know me and felt threatened so it pinched me. It hurt! They are comical and silly and make great and interesting pets.|`|78293c9d9f988cff35175902f59e7a85aa	I have had 2 hermit crabs a couple of years ago. They are very shy and really aren't that interesting (in my opinion). If you like a pet that you dont need to take for a walk or play with, hermit crabs are great.
133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	I would wait until your current dog passes away.  At this point in its life, it probably would be very stressful and hard to bring a puppy into the picture.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	nope, wait till it dies. It will be tramuatic on the new dog since they bond together.|`|teKAmT6Haa	it would be tressful but in a sence it could help your dog fell better like have someone to be with and not be as lonly<br>  anywany hope i helped|`|piE8mQM3aa	I would wait if I were you. I have an 11 year old Rottweiler (with 2 knee replacements- and almost blind) and my sister just got a pitbull a few months ago. Ginger (my rott) didn't take it so well. Mia (the pit) is a little spitfire and doesn't know when to stop and Ginger tries to growl at her and show her who's boss but Mia doesn't get it (I personally think because she knows Ginger is old and on her last leg). Mia literally runs circles around poor Gingy and jumps on her and antagonizes her. Poot baby :( Needless to say, Mia doesn't come over as much now that she is a bit bigger lol. <br>  <br>  PS. Our Chihuahua is more alpha and gets more places than Ginger (sadly haha). And our cats have attacked Mia before (but they are younger than Ginger). Do what your gut tells you to do!|`|DjeAUb5Faa	you should wait, they might not get along.  the puppy could bother the old dog by barking while the older dog is trying to sleep or relax.|`|pT0SFrlFaa	work with the puppy to keep it from biting the older one. puppies are bad a bout it|`|5UVIlXXiaa	No do not bring another dog or puppy in your home with another dog that age.

tPGxPDvBaa	I prefer Halti for my dogs but a couple like it & a couple never have taken to wearing one.  I think it just depends on the individual dog & what is comfortable to them.|`|B7ciNw0aaa	I like the Halti, because the dog can open their mouth. The Gentle Leader is meant to fit snug around the muzzle, which doesn't allow for panting or drinking- dangerous in hot weather.<br>  <br>  I've been working on training mine w/o the halti as well, but it's nice to have as backup.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	My dalmatian mix prefers the Gentle Leader over the Halti, and I think it's because it's what we've used since she was 12 weeks old. We were concerned about the nylon scraping at her face, too- so I sewed some fleece to the noseband to protect it. <br>     Also, in my experience, Chloe has been able to open her mouth, pant, and drink while wearing hers. Could it be the size of the muzzle? It's not so good for breeds with short muzzles, but I prefer the security of it, versus the Halti's recommendation that you use 2 leashes to keep them from escaping. <br>  <br>    Here's Chloe with her custom racehorse noseband:  <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15mi8w1&s=5" rel="nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15mi8w1&...</a><br>  <br>    We were walking on my parent's property, (all fended in, but HUGE, and hard to find Miss Chloe if she runs off,) so I took my parent's dog off of her leash and attached it to Chloe's collar so she could explore a little farther. It's retractable, so it couldn't go on her head collar.)|`|5x2DTMKYaa	We always liked the Gentle leader, for training, but we haven't needed it for a long time now.
kNYDHZqAaa	It is probably normal, but get your cat spayed and/or keep her inside! What would you do with the kittens if she got pregnant? There are already a lot of cats and kittens out there in shelters in desperate need of homes and under threat of euthanasia, please don't add to the problem. Not to mention your cat will probably be happier and stay closer to home if she is spayed.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, it is normal for him to bite her but WHY is she not spayed?  Get her spayed as soon as she comes back, otherwise you risk her getting breast/ovarian cancer, tons of other complications, or having kittens!<br>  <br>  You are an irresponsible owner and you do not deserve to own a cat.

If she is pregnant you should have the kittens aborted.|`|AA10500537	either get her spayed or  keep her in when shes in heat|`|Yk6EGhgNaa	This is for pointmissed,<br>  <br>  You are well-named, therefore you should not be answering questions, since you feel so free as to make judgements about whether or not someone's cat can breed or not! That was not the question, whether or not it could, or was allowed to, and someone should tell YOU not to breed because you're so thick in the head. We don't need any more of you on the face of the earth. I'll spell it out for you- n-o-n-e o-f y-o-u-r b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s-.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	Is you cat spayed?

AA11901352	You really need to add it prior to adding water to the tank.  Once the water is in your tank, adding dechlor to the water may find the filter pulling it out prior to it neutralizing the chloramates, heavy metals and other chemicals.   Since you have a bowl, as long as you added the proper amount, he should be fine.  You may even want to do another 25% water change, remember never 100% even in a bowl.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	It depends on where you live, a local fish/pet store should be able to tell you how important it is do add it.<br>  <br>  in most places as long as you don't make a habit of it your fish will recover.|`|uhP6zkC1aa	I used to forget all the time and my fish lived.
