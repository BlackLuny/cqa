20090131111334AAUBd4W	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:  What constitutes homosexual sin?	I've hear three distinct arguments on the subject and I'm wondering if there's a majority consensus among us.  If your personal view is not posted, please feel free to explain your position.    1)    Homosexuality is not sinful.    2)    Homosexuality is only sinful when acted upon. (It is possible to posses homosexual urges and still remain pure by repressing them.)    3)    Homosexuality is sin in every form (thoughts, deeds, fantasies, etc.)

Ok i'm a bisexual guy ever since i was little and i found guys to be sexually attracted, i love girls also just that i'm not sexually attracted to them.. And i also wish to have a girlfriend... But come to think of it, if i'm a girl i don't think i wanna have a bisexual boyfriend like me, rite girls? I was in love with my ex girlfriend but since where broke up so we had no feelings towards each other, and now i'm in love with my friend which i'm very close with.. We kissed before and also "did it" quite a lot of times.. But we are not couples, we just remain as friends.. What my point is, i so wish that i wasn't in love with him and i so wish that I'm not a bisexual guy.. I wish that i am straight!! Like everyone else and have kids in the future.. Can anyone help me turn myself into a straight guy? because if my family knew about my sexual orientation, i think they will kick me out of the house, and i don't think i can ever step into my house ever again. I bet my parents will be ashamed to have me as their child... And I'm a roman catholic as well.. It's a sin to be bisexual as a catholic..

It is common to hear Muslims boosting that Isalm is the fastest growing religion in the World. While EuroMerican governments and abled Western individuals spend huge amount of money on scientific researches and charities, on the other hand, the desperate Muslim governments and individual rich Muslims spend stupendous amounts on conversion of any unproductive light-skinned Westeners and African American etc to Islam--especially if the convertee was once prominent before he became a liability like Micheal Jackson etc. This wasteful  xenopobic daawah has let to an alarming uderdevelopment in the Islamic World. That was why a concerned Muslim raised the below alarm.          "Happy 1430 Hijria.        Happy?

20090131113213AAlix4p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about the Bible being scientifically accurate thousands of years ago?	 http://www.sbea.mtu.edu/users/slstonge/s...       The Bible and Stars      Jeremiah 33:22 (written 2500 years ago): "As the host of heaven cannot be  numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured."      The Bible claimed that there are billions of stars ("host of heaven" is the biblical term for the stars). When it made this statement, no one knew how vast the numbers of stars were as  only about 1,100 were observable. Now we know that there are billions of stars, and that they cannot be numbered.      The Earth's Free-float in Space   Job 26:7 (written 3500 years ago): "He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth upon nothing."         The Bible claimed that the earth freely floated in space. Science then thought that the earth sat on a large animal. We now know that the earth has a free float in space.      The Bible and Atoms   Hebrews 11:3 (written 2000 years ago): "Through faith we understand that the  worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."      The Bible claims that all creation is made of invisible material. Science then was ignorant  of the subject. We now know that the entire creation is made of invisible elements called "atoms."      Blood is the source of life   Leviticus 17:11 (written 3000 years ago): "For the life of the flesh is in the blood."      The Scriptures declare that blood is the source of life. Up until 120 years ago, sick people  were "bled", and many died because of the practice. We now know that blood is the source of life. If you lose your blood, you will lose your life.      The Bible Reveals the Earth is Round       Isaiah 40:22 (written 2800 years ago): "It is he that sits upon the circle of the earth."             The Bible informs us here that the earth is round. At a time when science believed that the earth was flat, it was the Scriptures that inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the  world. He wrote: "It was the Lord who put it into my mind. I could feel His hand upon me . . . there is no question the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit because He comforted me with  rays of marvelous illumination from the Holy Scriptures . . ." (From his diary, in reference to his discovery of "the New World").      for more science in the Bible     http://www.sbea.mtu.edu/users/slstonge/s...       i know most of you atheists will just ignore these facts and have a rediculous response to the question but just open up your mind and before you call the Bible a book of fairy tales, read it first.

Then when a person does take their own life God was ok with that if God does truly have the final say on who lives and who dies?

I think the idea of free-will & have given it a lot of thought- I think that it doesn't really exist ...i want you to help me understand otherwise if true.   Here's what i think:   We are limited beings who live according to limited conditions...      Every choice that you believe that you are freely taking is just an illusion that you want your mind to believe. The fact that you decide to listen to this romantic song & not a rock song is because of events & past & current experiences that make your present mood the way it is now which leads you to listen to a romantic song...you do not choose to....          I am posting this question here because of curiosity..curiosity that God embedded in us..i am helpless..i cannot fight the fact that this issue is bugging me deeply & i don't think i can put a meaning to life without an explanation to it....      The only way i can think of free-will is if God really exists and the only condition which enables you to freely choose is to either choose God ,if he truly exists, or to continue being brainwashed by this world's fake and shitty values and morals....the concept of free-will is made-up...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....      so tell me what you think...true?...or help me understand otherwise..thank you

Now I know that most of you will say heaven is a place for disembodied souls, but here's the thing.  If heaven is anything I wish (as reward you know for doing the right thing here on earth), then I want a body!  Now I've had some body parts removed prior to my Lord's Salvation And I want to know, what's up with the parts they took out before I was saved?  Do I get them back when I get to heaven?      I don't think heaven would be the same without my Gall Bladder, Tonsils, Big Toe Nails.  If God, being his omnipotent self, figured I needed them enough when I was born, then I figure he'd be wanting me to have them around when I get to heaven.  I mean, won't he be pissed that I lost them in the first place.  You know, kind of like being pissed when your kid loses his gloves or had.      What do you think.  Should I refuse to have surgery to remove any future damaged organs or risk doing with out them for eternity's duration.
20090131122307AA2mO7s	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there death after life?	God saved me last week, I was walking down the street and I tripped over the curb, thus missing being hit by a bus.  Compelled by the incident, I wondered about my new found salvation and thought God must have some earthly reason for my being here.  I wondered, is there  death after life?        Not the regular death, but the death we live here every day.  The mundane existence we all face wondering what went wrong in our lives.  Is that what we should expect in heaven?  A continuation of the same?      So I picked myself up off the curb, brushed the pebbles that had embedded themselves in my palms and continued on, thinking, God certainly must want me to have more death here before I experience death in heaven.       Am I right to think this way?

I don't understand at all.   Its as if He is setting them up for damnation, even before they are born.      I'm not looking for anyone to justify His thought pattern.   I'm not looking to step on anyone's beliefs.   But, if there is anyone who could answer my questions truthfully and without judgment, please, your answer will be greatly appreciated.      Thanks, Amber

Are you quite comfortable knowing your best friend and maybe boyfriend or girlfriend is destined to spend eternity in hell?       What would you assmue the percentage of religious folks actually believe strong enough in the bible and god to not go to hell?  Maybe half? So how does this make you feel?  Sad, sorry, hoping for them to see the light?  Or are you just so happy that you are going to be the chosen ones to go to heaven,  and to hell with everyone else?  Please give me a ballpark figure about what % of folks in the world are going to hell.  Don't forget to include the folks in places where your god has not been taught, as they will be forever doomed also.  Humm could look pretty grim.  But the bible is the bible and god is god so it's very good god is going to punish them for an eternity in hell for not believing and worshiping him.      Don't you have the mental capacity to understand a loving, caring, feelling, god would not do this to his children?  If god is just playing a game and using the bible as one of his scare tactics and in the end will let all folks go to heaven by making it where they understand about how to live in a peaceful society, then cool Good game      Try using your own thoughts for this question please don't use the bible's quotes.  Even though your religion tells you not to judge god, you certainly do judge him otherwise you wouldn't say he is a loving, all  knowing, all powerful god.So why can't you just use your human emotions and answer this question  and judge if you really think it is right for god to send his children to an eternal horrible life of hell for not believing in him as you do.  You need to remember that 90% of the people who don't believe in god, still agree that there is that possibility of god existing

20090131145638AAWRFdc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The difference b/w bible and Quran regarding Adam and Eve, which is more fair?	The judaeo-christian conception of the creation of Adam and Eve is narrated in genesis 2:4 thru 3:24. God prohibited both of them from eating the fruits of the forbidden tree. the serpent seduced evet to eat from it and eve in turn seduced Adam to eat with her. when God asked Adam, he put all blame on Eve. 'I'll greatly increase your pains in childbearing. your desire will be for your husband and he'll rule over you' (timothy 2:14)      let's look at what Quran says about the first creation:      "And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoers.  Then satan whispered suggestions to them: "Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals.''. And he said "Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.'   So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them (saying): "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Satan is an open enemy unto you" They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.''   (7:19-25)      the Quran,contrary to the Bible places equal blame on both Adam and Eve for their mistake. nowhere in the Quran can one find the slightest hint that Eve tempted Adam to eat from the tree or even that she had eaten before him.Eve in the Quran is no deceiver or temptress. moreover, Eve isnt to be blamed for the pains of childbearing. in Quran, God doesnt punish one for another's fault. both Adam and Eve sinned and asked for forgiveness and God forgave them both.      The Quran does not portray the pains of childbearing and pregnancy as a punishment, but rather enjoins people to respect their mothers for the pain they suffered.   " We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: in pain did his mother bear him and in pain she gave him birth" (46)

20090131175840AACQJKf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	They say God won't give you more than you can handle. Than why do I have a dark cloud following me?	For over 2 years my life is just getting worse. I keep looking up and saying it will get better. Still looking to get customers for my business even without a car. Walk miles to apply for jobs. Can't seem to get enough money for a car. I've sold just about everything I had. Yes, I have a place to live but I'm treated like crap. I don't even get respect from my kids anymore. I pray. I cry. I want to die. I always found joy in something but not anymore. No, this isn't a mental condition. Anyone with this kind of luck would have gone crazy already. I can't believe I'm still holding on when I know it is hopeless. It is time to face it. I lost the fight. So where is God and why won't he help me? I can't believe I'm asking this. I'm so lonely and desperate. Totally disgusted. Trust me, I do appreciate what I have but I know I shouldn't feel like a criminal in a prison. I did nothing wrong.

I'm a 17 year old girl and I really want to look androgynous (not really like a man or a woman).    I have a few different reasons for wanting this, mostly because I am genderqueer.    I am pretty hefty, but I'm on a diet and have lost ten pounds in the past few weeks, so I should be more slim soon enough. Right now I'm at a size twenty, and my goal is a size sixteen. (wish me luck by the way haha =))   Does anyone have any ideas of how to look more androgynous? Brest binding would be obvious, so does anyone have advice how to safely do that?   My hair is very short (about an inch from my head and usually bed head style) so I'm not worried about that, and I never wear makeup anyway.    Thanks in advance!

I really would just love to find someone else out there who'sughts coincide with my own... so here goes:    It is really very simple for me to make friends with people. Actually most people find me fun, entertaining, and great to be around but the problem is... I cant stand people! I mean, Humans, in general, are really quite complex creatures. We have these wonderful brains that are all set up to live happily amongst eacheach-other but the fact of the matter is: I dont want to. There are all those people who are like: "Im so alone!" ...or: "My life sucks right now!" and they are all suicidal. Well, no offense or anything, but cant you find a better reason to be done with this life? I mean really. I have, but unfortunately there are people here who need me to stay alive. So here I am; living for them! I just cant stand it! GRRRRRR! I cant stand life. Its so much damn work! So here is my question: Why in the world do we have to breathe in and out each day? Why do we have to socialize? Work? Play? Learn? WHY DO WE HAVE TO EXIST AT ALL?!

Muslims here have the right to Preach openly, our Government does not close Mosques, and there has been no wide spread persecution of muslims leading to them leaving the US.      Short take about Christians in Iran:      """"""As the world’s only theocracy, Iran has strictly proscribed the activities of its evangelical Christian citizens, closing down their churches and arresting known converts to Christianity. Under Islamic law, apostates who leave Islam are subject to the death penalty," Compass commented. "      Source: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news...       There are many more out there.

20090109001305AAYuHxu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there sound arguments for atheism?	"There is no god," is not a sound argument.  Neither is "I don't see any evidence," as it makes the determination of the existence of something entirely subjective.  Using this logic, there are no atoms, no cells, and no South Pole (if you've never been there.)        There are many arguments for the existence of God.  There's the Cosmological argument, the Teleological argument and the Anthropic principle, the Ontological argument, the Moral Law argument, and others.  (See  http://www.theologicalstudies.citymax.co...  for a short overview of each.)      Are there any sound reasons to believe that God does not exist?        (I realize that many say that atheism is simply lack of belief in the existence of any God, but from an argumentative standpoint, this is no argument at all -- it is an attempt to avoid the question.)      So do you have sound, logical arguments for your conclusion?  And what is the attraction of atheism -- which is a conclusion that God does not exist -- over agnosticism -- which says that the answer is not known?

20081108111329AA9bVBN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do people seriously believe these things?	I don't know, I feel like I constantly see people saying negative things about blondes. It goes beyond the intelligence thing - countless times I'll see someone generalize and say that blonde girls are shallow, easy, slutty, and of course, unintelligent. It's also often insinuated that blonde girls cannot exemplify "real beauty" or something - that only shallow guys prefer blondes, and that only women with dark hair are truly beautiful/"real" women/whatever.      Personally, I was born with blonde hair and blue eyes, and I grew up with blonde hair and blue eyes. I do get highlights, but so do plenty of people...I don't consider my hair "fake" because, for one thing, it's not dyed; for another, even three months later, it still looks completely natural - you won't find any roots unless you actually pull it up from my head and look closely. People are often SHOCKED when they actually talk to me and find out that I'm intelligent and that I don't really give a damn about "shallow" things. Various people have asked if I'm a virgin, a question to which the answer has always been yes, and that answer usually provokes an incredulous "Really?!" It's very annoying to be perceived this way, and I'm pretty sure that all I'd have to do is dye my hair dark if I wanted to be rid of this stereotype - but guess what? I'd feel like a fraud - only then would I truly be "fake."      I know much of this is perpetuated by porn stars, girls who bleach naturally dark hair, TV shows, Playboy, et cetera - but it's still ridiculous. Do people TRULY believe these things are true? If you saw me somewhere, would you avoid interaction with me due to preconceived notions like the aforementioned?

20060708164009AAWZjV7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Whould the religion of the future be like this?	The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism. (Albert Einstein)

The location and size of the structure match biblical descriptions.      Is there anything more addicting then learning about the world around us?

20060711113452AA3dsvl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religion thoughts....?	I was just wondering how other people thought on something I've been thinking of a while.      Anyway, I've been thinking a lot about religions, and the basic concept. Do they really serve a point, what exactly is the point, ect. I actually do want to take a look at more religions before I come up with a theory though...But doesn't it seem that Religion could be a mask for the truth...Meaning I'm sure everyone here has heard the saying "Because God wanted to" in trying to solve something, they don't understand, but yet the people that seem to state these types of things, never really go out of their way to try and prove that some divine power really made it that way, and why not? Wouldn't that prove to all of us (every human being on earth) that we should believe?       As an example of what I stated above...what was the sun in ancient Egyptian times (Ra?), what was lightening in the Ancient Greek times (Zeus?), and well you get the point right?

And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS and trees bearing fruit with seed in it ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS. And God saw that it was good... 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS, and every winged bird ACCORDING TO ITS KIND. And God saw that it was good…24 And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, EACH ACCORDING TO ITS KIND." And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS, the livestock ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS, and all the creatures that move along the ground ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS. And God saw that it was good.   Pretty good job of answering the question millenia before it was asked!

I am white guy who might be slightly racist but at the same time can appreciate various works of black people.      I see Farrakhan is a bright man.

It is clear that his own obsession with being black presents an enormous bias upon the potential validity of his conclusions.      What do you think?

Edna, I have read alot of posts today about you and I must let you know that your reputation proceeds you. I'm sure you are a nice person who just wants to make Yahoo a safer, cleaner place for all of the children and others who visit this site. I don't want to make you mad, poke fun at you, or call you names. I have even reported a few of those Fake Ednas. I just want to know why you have taken it upon yourself to report everyone who makes just a minor infraction. When people post against the guidelines, they either don't know that it's a rule and that they shouldn't do it or they just don't care. Not everyone reads the guidelines, I haven't but I still obey the rules as best I can, so please don't be too hard on the people who only make tiny mistakes and focus your energy on the real rule-breakers, the ones who know about the rule, but choose to ignore it. So please answer my question, why do you do it? Just curious really. Thanks Edna, and good night.

This is in your bible:      .” And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith; I am not learned.” Isaiah 29:12      This verse is a prophecy towards prophet Mohammed (pbuh), because Mohammad (pubh) was an unlettered prophet and when he was an unlettered prophet and when he was asked by Angel Gabriel to read out the first divine revelation upon him he said, “I am not learned”      When Archangel Gabriel commanded “read”, the Prophet said, “Ma, ana Bi Qarein”. “I am not learned”. This exactly is verbatim of what has been prophesied in the Old Testament in the Book of Isaiah Chapter 29, Verse No. 12.      ISLAM is not a new religion nor was it made up. Satan has made you're hearts heavy with hate and seek not knowledge or logic but cling onto a falsehood of truth preached to you not by Jesus or God but by corrupt men who still continue to rule over your destiny and you follow like the blind flock that you are.      Accept ISLAM with you're Hearts.

20061204085844AAhmeNU	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it alright to have this ethical policy?	I begin to think is this ethical policy fair.  I am a narrow minded person.  There is no denying it.  I don't feel homosexuals, religous fanatics or zealots (meaning you over-enthusiatic muslims, christians, scientologists, or jews), etc.'s actions have benefited society.  However I tolerate people and respect their opinions and differences as long as they follow the one rule I have.  My policy is "Don't bother me, I don't care".  I feel the whole gay marriage thing is just a push to gain special privelages, poolitical power, and attention to themselves like the gay parades and holidays.  I feel fanatic terrorists and the christians who have pushed to include intelligent design into school curriculums are equally damaging to society.  These factions have began pushing their ideas and beliefs upon society like force feeding.  I have no problem with them as long as their actions have no impact on me.  I just don't feel its right for any group to force legislation based on their beliefs

I have just never found a job that doesn't put me to sleep.    So since I am sleeping anyway why don't I just stay home, and enjoy some of the true pleasures in life; sleeping and eating!  I think it would be pretty fun training for something like this.  I could eat tons of steaks, bacon, eggs, drink glasses of butter(seriously it tastes good).  My wife says she will leave me if I do it but my other gf is actually encouraging me.  She says she will stay home and serve me so I won't burn calories.  So my question is how much, and should I go for it?  Thanks

Brake pads are in the shelves behind the counter where only employees can get it. Manager got me the brake pads open the box walked over and handed it to the cashier, i didn't touch the box. After looking at my receipt i see a charge for some kind of brake grease? They slipped it into the box without even asking me if i wanted to buy it and rang up in the cash register. when i asked the cashier why is that there, she had a grin on her face and just blew me off. Is this right thing to do? They should not be able to charge me something without even telling me about it, you think they figured i don't know anything about brake pads so here will charge him for this too? he'll buy it. It really frustrated me that they slipped something in there without telling me, who else have they done this too i wonder!      Are there any ex Autozone employees or current unhappy employees out there can enlighten me in this situation?
20081028045838AAUTic2	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Who out there has ever seen a ghost?  Give details please. ?	See, I seen the shadowy figure of one.  Back in the "90s, I started staying with my grandma for awhile since she lived alone, and my parents thought someone should stay with her for her safety.  One night I lay there in my bed on the opposite end of her mobile home, and I heard footsteps like she had gotten up and came in the kitchen.  I got up and looked; no one was there.  The kitchen light was left on during the night for a nightlight, and since I didn't see grandma in the kitchen, I glanced down the dimly lit hallway where the kitchen light tried to reach its furthest but could not make it all the way down the hall.  I began hearing the footsteps down that dimly lit hallway along with the shuffling of feet.  So, I stood in my doorway on one end of the trailer straining my eyes to see if I could see grandma moving around in the hallway.  All of a sudden, I seen some tall shoulders of a very tall figure turning around down there right where the walking sound now was coming from.  Just like the stereotypical reaction you see in the movies or shows like the "Three Stooges" back in the day, my hair started rising on my head, and I got goosebumps.  After a minute or so, I harnessed all the nerve I could and stormed down the hallway to wake up my grandma (Who Was Asleep As I Thought She Was.)  Once I woke her up, I told her about the ghost I had just witnessed down the hall, and she snickered, "Ha ha ha.  That was 'ol Charlie checking on me, I guess.   Ha ha ha."  See, Charlie was her very tall (about 7 foot tall) boyfriend who had recently died and had been living there with her off and on.  So, tell me about some of your encounters, please.  This is the right season for ghost stories ,too, since it's almost Halloween.

20081017234251AAnCbUV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do People think Black People have higher Crime rates than White People!?	For instance, lots of people use statistics to 'prove' blacks commit more crimes than whites. However, their argument is flawed because they only look at the crimes blacks typically commit. They ignore white collar crime like identity theft, embezzlement, toxic dumping, corporate crimes, real estate fraud etc. Also,the fact that black communities tend to generally have lower income levels in comparison to whites means it is to be expected that certain crimes would be commited more often within their communities, which would be the case for any group of people.      The argument is bunk. In fact, when you measure the crimes by the amount of damage the crimes create (in terms of dollars lost and human suffering), the exact opposit is true. Whites are responsible for the vast majority of crimes done to society.      Best defense? Learn statistics and use them correctly and fairly

People are given rules to live by, most just common sense, but how they will be punished if they don't follow them or "worship" the dictator.      It's a choice, worship and vote for the dictator and he will give you a better life than if you choose to vote against him.      Anyone see any similarity here?      That's why I am atheist. I will not be forced into worshiping a bully and dictator. Not that I beleive he exists, but IF I am wrong I will stand by my choice NOT to have beleived in god or worshiped him. I live my life without harming anyone and the so called "sins" that I was apparently born with I fail to see how a child has any sin at all??? I have learned by my mistakes and lived my life continually improving myself and others lives. If that's not good enough then TOUGH!!!

It looks so fun!I'm 17 about to turn 18 in 8 more months and to all of you who had experienced in going to a high school graduation party,I was wondering how is it like for all of you Americans?Is it sorta like the ones they have in "American Pie" or "Can't Hardly Wait" ?Damn,I would really love to go to a party that's similar to those.You know where you get drunk and high with a big crowd of people.And then you strip and get laid and stuff like that.I bet those parties are really illegal.So have any of you been to one before?I haven't because I'm living in Taiwan now and trust me Chinese parents are so different from American parents,They would never allow teens to have parties like these because all they care about is school,studying,and other shits that have to do with it and locking them at home and making them become nerds.It's just so ******* boring over here in Taiwan.So please,i want ya'lls' opinions to my question.thanx.

Lately I started seening it. I've been using a white light shield, but either I did something wrong or it it isn't working right. At first I wasn't worried about it other than its energy. It seemed friendly, my cats would play with it and it would rub on things like it wanted to be pet or to play. It is black and shadowy and looks like it has the head of a black panther and the body of a bear. Tonight my best friend saw it, usually I'm the only one who can see it. I have experience with ghosts, I've been able to see them and here them and feel them for most of my life. Also this morning I woke up with scratches all over my forearm. At first I thought it was just from my cat, but there are more dots than scratches so she would have had to stick her claws in and pull them straight back out. Also she never scratches no matter how angry she gets. To see the scratches follow this link:    http://s663.photobucket.com/albums/uu354...

I love your warm smile   And your kind, thoughtful way,   The joy that you bring   To my life every day.   I love you today   As I have from the start,   And I'll love you forever   With all of my heart.

I need an original way that I can ask this guy that I have a crush on to Sadie's. I recently moved to my town and I've only been here for 4 months. Also, this guy has always had a date, and he said that he's been asked in really creative ways; like scavenger hunts and stuff. So I need a creative idea, but not one that has already been done.   Thanks guys!  :]
