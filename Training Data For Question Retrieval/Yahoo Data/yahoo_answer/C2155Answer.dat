The points help you build your reputation on Yahoo!7 Answers and show the world what you have to offer. You need points to ask a question but you can quickly earn the points back by resolving your question and by giving an answer that is picked as best. The points table linked below summarizes how many points you get for each of the different actions you take. The points allow the community to recognize how active and helpful you've been, and they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.|`|AA10976046	Just to show how active you are.

I guess Yahoo figures most folks would rather do one-on-one IM conversations as opposed to chatrooms where anyone can come and go.  And for the most part they are right, but....I do kinda miss the old chatroom days where you could have a couple of dozen people meet in the same virtual space online and shoot the breeze in as innocent or non-innocent a manner as you like...    Still I can see where the problem is.  It is a bit of a security risk, my ISP had to totally deny and cancel all support for Internet Relay Chat a year or so ago when some hackers created an unathorized "chat room" and used it to hack the local mail server and trash things for a couple of weeks.  :(  Why *do* some folks only seem to want to *break* things?    Ahh, who knows, it takes all kinds, you know?  Even the "pervs", who aren't always perverted 24/7, you know?|`|AA12051950	What pervs ? What chat rooms?

Guess they ought to be reported more often.

8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	Yeah, season 3 starts soon and I've been watching  promos of the new cast. Looks like 'Queen' Kyndra has her Cami/Lexie clique and there'll be lots of drama between them and Tessa and her friend Raquel.    They sure aren't as pretty as last season's girls. I already can't stand Cami, she's the biggest gossip ever! Yada yada yada blah blah blah, enough already, and her big chest-are those real or what? She's always flashing them.    Tessa seems sweet though, good to see Jessica return from last season to hook-up with hot Cameron. Looking forward to seeing Chase and Kelan playing in their Open Air Stereo Band.    So even though these rich girls are spoiled rotten and whine over every little thing, I'll be watching to see how good it really is.|`|390da80c429e1dc10bdc2d88afabbd92aa	Yeah , but I bet people like you and I will still watch, Huh?

uw3J8M0waa	If you are currently a paid Internet subscriber, you are entitled to a "homepage" which often contains simple navigation and editing tools. And if you use the Netscape browser, the built-in Composer feature is a superior HTML authoring tool. You can easily generate a full-blown website as a Homepage. Nevertheless, the "homepage" URL is likely to be "http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscribe... name" and that URL can easily be overwritten via a redirection service, i.e., "mydomain.com" which allows you to link any registered domain name to "mask" another website. For example, should you type in "domainname.com", you will be immediately transported to the homepage and the hompage URL of <a href="http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber..." rel="nofollow">http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber...</a> name will be masked by the domainname.com. And the charge for the redirection service [even at godaddy.com] is normally FREE. Here's a demonstration: Type in the URL window: "www.pizzanextdoor.com" which will bring up their pizza website. Take note of the domain name. Then type in the URL window: "http://home.pacbell.net/vten/1a/pizzame... and you will see that this is the original homepage which is unmasked without the domain name!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Just click on the “thumbs up” icon to give someone a “thumbs up” and show you approve of or like their answer; same but reverse meaning  with “thumbs down,” click on the icon to show you disapprove or don’t like the answer.. It doesn’t cost you any points to “rate” an answer but, once you do rate, you’re stuck with that rating. You can’t later change your mind and decide they don’t deserve the “thumbs up” or have regrets about giving a “thumbs down.” They’re forever.<br>  <br>  Stars are ways to show approval for questions. You click on the star icon to give a star, click on the same place to remove your star after you give it. No points involved..<br>   <br>  Answer a question and get 2 pts. Ask a question and lose 5 pts. Choose the "best answer" to your question and get 3 of those 5 pts. back.  Be chosen as "best answer" and get 10 pts. plus 1 bonus pt. for each "thumbs up" your answer received. There’s no deduction for “thumbs down.”<br>  <br>  Anyone, even people on level 1, can "vote" but it's not the same as "rating" with thumbs up/down.<br>  <br>  Vote for "best answer" on unresolved questions “in voting” and you get 1 pt. per question.  You can vote by clicking on the “answer” toolbar at the top of the page then click on the “vote” tab or, when you see the list of questions available in a particular category, there’s a “vote” tab at the top of the questions. Either way, if you vote then you earn a point per question and help pick the “best answer.”<br>  <br>  You also get 1 pt. every day for just logging in. It’s as easy as that!<br>  <br>  Good luck, you'll be on level 2 in no time and then aim for level 3 (1,000 to 2,499 pts.)

Shakespeare was the most wonderful learning experience I've had in college and in theater.

Marriage is supposed to be a holy union, not something you do cause you couldn't keep it in your pants.    Also, most of his plays are implausible beyond belief. Namely, the Merchant of Venice. The main character doesn't recognize his own girlfriend in court dressed as a man. Helloooooo.    Shakespeare hated the Jews and Poles and wrote them into villian roles - Merchant of Venice and Hamlet are just two examples.    Shakespeare is largely around today because he totally sucked up to the English royalty, Elizabeth I and James. I hate suck ups. You should earn rememberance on ability to WRITE not kiss butt!|`|f7b16016443def752e315850ea8903ceaa	I hope that you are kidding. Books are for reading, not banning or burning. Shakespeare captured human behavior and emotion so well. It would be a terrible loss.|`|afc332af58051e41c6c7fec19272af39aa	Why would they ban Shakespeare? I think there is to much emphasise on Shakespeare in American education. There are so many better authors, but the English departments in and of themselves are faulty (like, the Scarlet Letter? Why the hell are we FORCED to read that in some high schools? It's not good writing, and it's message is awful. )    I think Macbeth is really good, and i don't see why something like that would be banned. Shakespeare was an amazing writer, and not being allowed to teach him is wrong. Just like Catcher in the Rye and Invisible Man shouldn't be banned. Foul language, racism, those shouldn't be bannable offenses in writing, that's life. It should be read and valued for it's educational value.|`|39712e1a01845d9d87ed4652829c33d2aa	I think it's a bad idea to ban any kind of literature.  If you don't want to read it, you don't have to.  For those who want to they should be able to get what kind of things they can from it.  Shakespere can be a bit risque, but then again you have to have a grasp of old English to even understand what is being said.  So, there's education there as well.

It just feels like that because you are unhappy at the moment    Start by making a list of the things about you and your life that you like, or which are OK. . Have you got a cute nose, good skin, neat ankles, a nice bedroom, a good friend? Or other things that you can feel pleased about. That should make you feel a bit better.    Then look at the things you don't like, but which you could change. Than choose one and change it. The fact that you can do that will give your self confidence a boost.

I could help you but I don't have photoshop on here. In photoshop, you make 2 copies of that pic... select and cut that blue eye--copy it and paste it onto the brown one...or you can use the stamp tool to grab the color and pattern from the blue eye and stamp it onto the brown one.

TWHDDAz0aa	well a good idea would be to drink hot tea, not a lot of sugar, and no milk. also do more than just sirens, sing through various arpeggios and scales, moving up and down in keys. also, stretch out your body so there is no tension, it takes 82 or so muscles to sing, a good warm-up would go like this: do it on solfege or numbers, start in C major  Do Re Mi Fa So So So Fa Mi Re Do Do D S F S M S R S D S F S M R D D S F S M S R S D S F S La Ti D or in numbers 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 5 4 5 3 5 2 5 1 5 4 5 3 2 1 1 5 4 5 3 5 2 5 1 5 4 5 6 7 8. if you don't use either method start on C and go C D E F G G G F E D C C C G F G E D G C G F G E D C C G F G E G D G C G F G A B C'. and move up and down keys, try other combinations of notes and create your own warm ups....but definitely do the stretching

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Fanboxnotes is part of the Fanbox spam and scam system.     I've seen quite a few users on YA trying to get out of their fanbox account, so I looked into it - they are not associated with Yahoo and are no part of the Yahoo business whatsoever. I then went to a couple of forums and in everyone of them people were complainig about fanbox. It seems that they offer many applications, but that they are mainly after mail addresses to send you lots of spam.    In a Google group "greyjackal" posted 2008-06-12 21:35:14: >    This is what you can do...  To manually add an address or domain to your list of blocked addresses:   1: Click "Mail Options," located near the top-right corner of the main Mail page.   2: Click the "Block Addresses" link.   3: Type the domain you want to block in the "Enter email address (or domain) to block" field.   4: Click on the "Block Address" button.

Unscrupulous thieves have sent you this email and they are trying to part you from your hard earned cash.

AhO0Uoppaa	reported joke lol      no guys ever said anything sweet to me if he did id break his nose|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Whenever you direct a question to "you" it can be considered chatting.

Seems like a big mystery.  I feel bad so I'll give you a star.  Sweetest thing?

I don't think they really review the reports at all, they just go ahead and give you a violation, because i've had some questions deleted for no reason, as well as many others...    the sweetest thing a guy said to me is that i've changed the way he views the world:)|`|AA10500537	dont know why ive seen worst|`|qCY8osyIaa	I know!!  I had a poll going on something... (don't remember) and I got an email saying it was deleted and if I had any questions to email whatever @ yahoo. something.  So I asked what was wrong in it and they replyed. "We have reviewed your question and concluded that it was indeed against the community guidelines."  Oh, well, I'm glad you cleared that up!!    Super annoying!!|`|vwqjG9vfaa	I have no idea how this works, but it seems vastly unfair to me.    I think it is automated, but what the program is is anyone's guess|`|WcYRd9DLaa	if you asked a simple question like that and you were deleted, does not make sense, maybe it was taken out of context,   i myself would have answered something like this,  HERES MY BANK ACCOUNT WITH 50 MILLION IN IT AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT, BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH.    HA HA HA , who cares what the sweetest thing any guy has said   TALK IS CHEAP!!

lqbAA0Ytaa	Please don't create another account. That is totally against Y!A rules. You will get caught and run the risk of not only having your back up account suspended, but you risk having your entire Yahoo! account suspended. You will just have to wait to answer more questions tomorrow.    Until then, work on your 40 "Best Answer" votes that you are allowed per day. You receive 1 point for each vote, with the exception of a "No Best Answer" vote. No point for those.  Vote in your favorite category or jump around to various categories you have knowledge in. It is a good way to see what else is out there.|`|KIvO8IDpaa	make a new account for the day. all stop being so freaky. you dont need to anwser questions. jeez. go for a walk or something. thats weird.|`|DAewLvNKaa	ask a friend to 'borrow' their account, or make a new one quickly, just as a backup|`|Rvl0BiKvaa	I don't think there is a solution unless you have another Y account.  i guess wait until tomorrow...|`|v0jFDTwYaa	wait
79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	Maybe your friends had problems with people bothering them so they chose to block everyone that's not on there friend list, if they think you went inactive and deleted you then its as your not on you can see them but they can't see you.  The reason I'm guessing this is I blocked someone once unblocked them and they said what happened didn't you get any of my messages, if they have blocking enabled then your message is being intercepted before it can get to them.  If you can contact them by email or something and see if they have a block going.  Good Luck

Answers it is posted onto the site for anyone to answer, to give people a chance to answer it, the question has to be open for a minimum of 4 hours.    Once 4 hours has passed the User has the Options of: Leaving the question open, Putting it to community vote, or choosing a best answer themselves.  ********************************  I see you wish to choose a best answer: Once 4 hours has past, go to your question, read all answers, and then click the blue button that says 'choose as best answer' under the answer you wish to choose as best.    Then Give the Answer a 1-5 star rating, 1 being the lowest, and 5 being the highest. then give feedback, or a thank-you to the answer via the 'feedback box'    Once you have chosen the answer as best you will automatically receive 3 points back.|`|vQq6rZa3aa	You have to rate them!!

Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."

But don't make an even bigger mistake by trying to "unsubscribe" from the spam e-mails.    You should never open Spam/junk, (etc.) mail---and MOST especially not to "unsubscribe", (possible virus)  Spammers (and their like) are set up through an automated system to SEND-----NOT to receive.   All your "unsubscribe efforts" will be for naught.    All you will accomplish is to create more spam for yourself----since spam mails usually contain a tracking device,--- that, when opened, will automatically send your address to the "valid and responsive" list, that every spammer in the world has access to for pennies.    Just start clicking the "spam" tab----or delete them----unopened, of course.  It will take some time (of course)---but "eventually" it will taper off, (when they get no responce), and they'll move on to "greener pastures".|`|AA10551195	Dum da dum dum DUH! You already know the reason for this - you signed up for something you didn't know much, if anything, about, and now you want out of it. They must have a line of very small print that says something about "unsubscribe." Click on that, unsubscribe, and keep a record of when you did this. If they say their email will stop in 24 hours, or 48 hours, or a week or 10 days, keep track of it.

pCfbHDgBaa	Hi,I have just downloaded a Wallpapaer to my phone from the Myxer site and it was pretty straight forward(I have a wireless Samsung). I looked through the help pages to check the procedure for Motorola and it seems to be the same...aslong as your phone is wireless too. If you are having trouble still then there are some very good help pages http://support.myxer.com/ and I would suggest that you look through these and if you are still having trouble then contact the Tech. support that the site offers.  It could be that your phone is not authorised to allow the nature of some of the content from the site(some of it is over 18 only) and you may need to change your phone account settings(the instructions on how to do so are on the help pages that I have provided in the link). Good luck and i am sorry that I can't help further =)

dPIGhTPnaa	Yes you can.  It is a matter of setting your Thunderbird to the proper settings in what is called POP.  These are numbers sort of like a phone number or web address.  (Essentially, when you enter a web address into the address bar, the name like Ubuntu.com is seen by the computers as a number and not letters.  But this is irrelevant)       Mozilla has a tutorial for setting up your Thunderbird to read these numbers and also gives you the option of leaving a copy of the mail online when you read these, in case you have a problem with Thunderbird.  This way you don't lose the mail.      As to the violation of Yahoo policies, no.  POP server access is not against the policies of Yahoo.  These are your e-mails to be accessed as you please.      go to this address:  http://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_webmail_...  from there, go to the WebMail Extention and install this.

You gain access to most of the Deviant assets with a free membership, including uploading your own profile and gallery of artwork. You may offer your prints, paintings, books or photographs for sale through deviantART.  Step2    Upgrade to a subscription deviantART account. This paid feature allows users to utilize larger thumbnails, a personal calendar, shoutbox and forum and customize their page with additional features. An artist may purchase a 1-month, 3-month or 1-year subscription.    Step3  Add an image by clicking on the "Submit Deviation" icon under choices. Check "Yes" underneath the Terms of Service Agreement and you'll get the "Submit Art" screen. Enter a title for your work, then choose a category from the drop-down list. When you make a choice like "painting," other lists will appear, prompting you to describe the piece in more detail. A drawing can be described as conceptual or storybook, for example.    Step4  Upload a JPEG of your drawing, painting or print. You may add comments about the work in the "Artist's Comments" box, and enter keywords so people can find your work more easily. You may disable or encourage comments through the Deviation Options, and warn viewers about mature art content.    Step5  Click on the optional "Creative Commons" license if you want to share your art and receive proper credit for it. You may let people share and distribute the work you submit for non-commercial use with proper attribution, and allow or restrict derivative versions of the piece.

You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	Now you have 200 points, so you need more 50 to be at level 2.

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|uxJ3TGvuaa	u need 250 pts|`|AA10696542	Vote as much as you can.

S9bEtVCSaa	I don't think you can. I think you just have to reconcile the fact that idiots are reporting you out of whatever form of sick jealousy they are suffering, and if you petition you will only end up losing points.

And they didn't say why. I 'd possibly agree on deleting a posted poem for a good reason, but on a resolved one?!<br>   Can you think of who would go digging into your posted and/or resolved questions to report them, except some one who is naively jealous bat, sadly depressed rat,  or weasel suffering deep inferiority complexl! <br>  I wish those people 'd show up when the Q is being posted and show the question-poster where did he go wrong-- like any traffic policeman. Meh!!|`|NuvKPl3naa	i had questions deleted too, but mine were because there was not an answer , but i know you get answers all the time. i guess they just pick and choose. i went to look awhile back to see if you were changing your avitar name and the question was gone.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Semper, go to Customer Care or <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/">http://help.yahoo.com/</a> , if you have not been sent a violation notice.<br>  They should be able to help you|`|dQmFoRRiaa	Semper, I have my suspicions that it is a fully automated system with only occasional human oversight.  I suspect that when a certain number of reports are made, a comparison of the specific natures of the complaints is made and then if there is agreement, removal of the question is all but automatic.  If the complaints differ, then the question may be more likely to remain.  Clearly, this is a MAJOR problem, because it would allow users to gang up on a question and have it removed even if it were inoffensive. It fosters hooliganism.  I may be wrong, but I find no better explanation.  I also suspect that it is the way it is because to have intelligent people manning all these posts would be a prohibitive expense.  The suffering is likely to continue.  I will also tell you that I answer disproportionately more math and science questions and have NEVER had even one violation notice in those areas.  Something is rotten in Denmark, aka the Poetry section, but Europe appears not to have been swept by the contagion, so to speak!  Your predicament, and frustration, are my own.  That is why I went to the other sections in the first place (plus I am qualified by education and vocation to address those questions).  I doubt the situation will improve radically until adults start behaving as adults, but if you look around you you'll be reminded what a far-flung hope that is!  All you can do is email Yahoo!, being specific about your concerns (despite your broad frustration), and pray for a revolution of compassion and civility to open the hearts, and minds, of your fellow man.

So don't send something that you don't want to permanently part with because that is a possibility.<br>  <br>  If you don't have something to send to be autographed, then simply state in your letter that you would like an autographed photo.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|281e15d03cf9ec29448c44e9c13f42b8aa	just send an item or pic that you want signed. and most likely it will get signed. but yeah all you gotta do is send the item you want signed and they will sign and it send it back. so yeah. hope it works outt.

AA11393214	Phishr has an excellent suggestion.  I would also continue reporting him.  Maybe eventually it will get through to those in power.<br>  <br>  Suggestion here:  go to the area marked Forum at the top right-hand side in this area and post a suggestion to make it harder for someone to get away with this sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  You put in the effort and should be recognized for it, not him.|`|d3vFXLliaa	I don't think there is any way to prevent this. I would maybe call him out at the end of your answer. Maybe even a personalized note (with his user name) letting people know to expect his response to mirror yours. The at least it wouldn't confuse other users and maybe he will stop. Maybe he is envious because he has nothing to say but wants to.|`|3ea84e4fa10080966acac56a95e99f15aa	The only way I can think of is by blocking the user. However if he has more than one account this may be useless. <br>  This is a big problem since the site is public and the only other way is to report them to Yahoo and hope Yahoo removes their accounts.

VXW1XeFsaa	If it is something I would never tell anyone, then I wouldn't tell it here would I?  I suppose most people's secret is that they are doing something that they have been taught is wrong morally or ethically or legally.  They are either afraid that when someone they love finds out, that person will be hurt, or they are afraid of public embarrassment, or they are afraid of criminal prosecution.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	personal info

nRAHzYUgaa	To use a real photograph, you need a Yahoo 360 account. You can then put up to 4 pictures on there for use as an avatar elsewhere in Yahoo.<br>  <br>  In your Answers Profile, look SE of your existing Avatar.<br>  Click on 'Edit My Info'.<br>  In your profile settings, you will see three options, for avatars:<br>  Default avatar<br>  Use photograph on 360<br>  Use a caricature built from identikit parts.<br>  <br>  Choose the option required, save the profile, and wait for the changes to happen. Other people seem to use photos with no problem, but there still seems to be something wrong with mine, making it unavailable on Yahoo Answers:<br>  <a href="http://uk.360.yahoo.com/my_profile-YXNa6RgjdKFm3jFsfzb5bhUIbcATYKd9Sd_Qjov.sBWVqHWp1Cg-?cq=1">http://uk.360.yahoo.com/my_profile-YXNa6...</a>|`|F2ugW4cRaa	You need to upload a picture to your Y360 account, and then opt to use that avatar here.<br>  Or<br>  Go to Edit my profile edit my avatar make an avatar and save.|`|ZtkARkT8aa	go to your profile and click where it says edit my profile or something like that and click it .
