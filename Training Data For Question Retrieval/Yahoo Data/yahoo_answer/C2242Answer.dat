750e87bc4ad1bcfc5beb92e80e408e6caa	It will be quite a while. The PSP currently has no real competitors in its niche ( the GBA and DS kinda cater to a different crowd.) I'd say, if you have the dough...get one now. It has some real gems on it. Just remember, many of the games are console ports...so if you don't really need something portable, then the PS2 or Xbox may suffice for the same type of game. Plus, both systems are much cheaper and easier to find used games on. However, the PSP does have many exclusive titles that you may be interested in. Plus, the fact that it is portable is a plus. <br>  <br>  As far as the music goes, nothing can match the capacity of an iPod, especially the minuscule Pro Duo Cards on the PSP. I bought a 2GB card for mine, so I could put music on it...but still nowhere near as nice as 30GB. Plus, the shell around the PSP is rather easy to scratch. So, I don't recommend using it for in-the-pocket player anyways. <br>  <br>  It does play movies quite well though, especially off the UMD disks. Also, there are programs on the Internet that can trans code DVD movies over to PSP-playable files that can be moved to the Duo Card using a USB cable. Cool!<br>  <br>  You may want to take a look at the DS. While the lower processing power and the odd design may deter some people, it really is a great system too...especially if you like Nintendo titles. The dual screen is innovative and there are many titles that you will not find anywhere else. Plus, it is quite a bit cheaper than the PSP and can also play GBA titles as well, making it have a much larger library of games to choose from.|`|b5188aed0af943d5c21572495b56710aaa	The price in the UK has only just dropped so its unlikely to drop again. You will always be waiting as after one price drop another one is 12 months away. How long do you wait before getting one?<br>  <br>  The console itself is great.

Its all tied to your steam username and password, you simply logon when you first install and it lists all the games your purchased and entitled to.<br>  <br>  3) You need internet to play the games online or download them but once they are on your hard disk you dont need the internet again.<br>  <br>  The thing to note is you need broadband, bear in mind your going to be downloading gigs and gigs of data and to do so via modem will take weeks. Takes a few hours by broadband.<br>  <br>  Dont ever EVER cheat!!!! I made that mistake, if your get caught cheating (and I gurantee you will eventually, even if you use it once and never again you could be banned months later) if you get caught they ban your account from playing on secure servers FOR LIFE!!! You can get around this by creating a new account but you then dont have your games, you need to buy them again.<br>  <br>  Steam is great, before games are released they pre-load, you pre-load for free where it downloads the game encrypted and then on release day you simply logon and it unlocks them (assuming you purchased the game).|`|697751484ba8844f31061bf364074ce8aa	yes you can downlaod it again<br>  <br>  you dont need a code with it as you play it via steam<br>  <br>  you have to be logged on the steam to play it

b5188aed0af943d5c21572495b56710aaa	you cant cheat. Valve do everything to stop all cheats in the game as it gives players an unfair advantage. They have a complex system which detects all cheaters., if caught your account is banned from playing on any servers other than those with other cheaters. This ban is pernament for your lifetime. So dont cheat.<br>  <br>  Useful, just play and play, you get better with time. Dont run in, stay back, be tactical.
b5188aed0af943d5c21572495b56710aaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  The PSP can only run programs specifically written for it. This means normal PC virus;s will not do anything as they cannot run.<br>  <br>  A virus is nothing more than a program somone has written that is designed to spread and do damage.<br>  <br>  With older firmware the PSP is capable of running programs written by anyone, virus's included. At present there are a couple of programs which say they do one thing but infact just kill your PSP but they have no way of spreading.<br>  <br>  If your PSP is runnign the latest firmware (2.80) there is currently no way for it to run any program that is not digitally signed by sony, this means there is no way you can damage your PSP by browsing the web, either on purpose or by accident. Older PSP's can be damaged if you run one of these fake programs.<br>  <br>  You can upgrade your PSP to 2.80 free from the Playstation web site.|`|AA11782519	yup u sure can|`|AA10193948	yeh, if the virus is designed for it.

Logic 3 cancelld the project after Sony refused to help. For the keyboard to work the software on the PSP would need to support this, This means sony need to make some changes but they refused to do so. as a result all keyboard projects are no longer in production.

Stay in for a few seconds and jump back out. Continue with the level and you'll notice that all of the ships are now white. The cannons on the the ship with the magna boot part don't fire anymore.

b5188aed0af943d5c21572495b56710aaa	You cant, not if you update to 2.80 as your previous question asked.<br>  <br>  Games onto the memory stick is illegal, you need to download them in a special ISO format, you cant just copy from your UMD.<br>  <br>  Also you MUST HAVE firmware 1.50 in order to run the necessary software to play the games.<br>  <br>  But as most games require newer firmware than 1.50 you then have to run another program called devhook to make th ePSP think its a newer firmware. Its all a bit messy and you need a big ol' memory stick too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.psp-hacks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-hacks.com</a>

AA10661379	The siren is only really used in the first and third games (the movie is based on the first game, and the third game is a "sequel" to the first game). In 1 and 3, the siren pretty much signals the coming of the "alternate dimension" (Alessa's world).<br>  <br>  The movie doesn't go into too much detail about what the "alternate dimension" is. They do make mention about bringing about Alessa's "darkest dream" to them. That's pretty much what it is in the games 1 and 3, too. In the second game, the "alternate dimension" takes on a different meaning, because the context is different, and Alessa isn't even mentioned at all. In the fourth game, it's hardly discussed in any detail.<br>  <br>  The overriding context to every game, though, is that Alessa is the reason Silent Hill is as it is, even if she's not a major player in the game.|`|c0afdec205b2b503abcfbc9c2103dcf9aa	i played all these game and all of them switch to other realm <br>  and yes i do believe the siren does sound off in the first game just like did in the movie but in the game you have to complete certain things before it switch to the other realm|`|AA11278471	It's been awhile, so I can't remember, but I think so.

ce3c2c9282a2f2e239e1a551a89fb264aa	The only negativity comes from how a person reacts to the surroundings they are playing in.  Obviously if you're in some place "dark and scary" (like a dark house late at night, or a graveyard) people are going to freak out.<br>  <br>  Also it depends upon the person themselves. Some children have no problem climbing into a dark closet for the duration of the game, others find it difficult to even go under a blanket.  It is the same for roller coasters.  Some people absolutely love them and will ride repeatedly... others can't even look at one without going gooshy.|`|31f50b507e1f9bd42dc84b0947afb233aa	yes if you aren't clear that you only play it when everyone knows you are playing -- a good example of a bad time to play hide and go seek is in the mall if the parent doesn't know the kids are playing; it can be terrifying if the kids are good at the game and won't reveal their location when you call to them|`|da299c62a221a555ad4046ee9f846c8aaa	they always hide in the same place|`|04c6c3e2cbf354f1507fd86822ad507faa	no not really i play that with my kids|`|AA10645163	not really. just make sure you dont go too tough on them with your hiding. and when u are seeking look around for a while, even if you know where they are. it makes them feel clever|`|AA11455628	Depends on how you play it.

However, be warned; if you start with this <br>  team in manager mode, your salary will be high. Make sure to cut their <br>  contracts down as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  To start with a five star team immediately in career mode, go to the <br>  team management screen. Put the bad players in the first eleven so <br>  that your team will be a four star team. Then go to career mode. <br>  Your team should be there. Save your career, then go back to the team <br>  management screen. Put the first eleven players back, save it, and you <br>  will have the normal team on friendlies and your team on career mode.<br>  <br>  Fully fit team in manager mode:<br>  -------------------------------<br>  When in manager mode, notice that the energy bars of your players <br>  decrease after each match. Save your career, then go back to the main <br>  menu. Load your career again. Your team will have full health again. <br>  Note: This may not work the first time. Save and reload the game maybe <br>  once or twice more for it to work.<br>  <br>  Increase profits in manager mode:<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  At the start of your season, do not spend the money you have immediately <br>  on staff upgrades and new players. Instead, spend the money you have on <br>  renewing player contracts. Wait to get your players morale up first, as <br>  they will be more likely to accept a renewal if they are happy at the club. <br>  Sometimes you can cut a players salary in half, if not more. Make sure to <br>  save the game before renewing contracts so that you can start low, and <br>  increase each time if the player refuses the renewal. If a player refuses <br>  the renewal at a high price, and they have a high moral, then it may be <br>  because they are close to retirement. This can earn you up to 3,000 <br>  credits (off your current salary) each match if done well. Alongside a <br>  good sponsor, you could be earning 7,000 to 8,000 credits each game <br>  when at home.<br>  <br>  Start as five star team in career mode:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  To do this you must unlock career teams in the My Fifa menu. <br>  You can do this by completing the challenges set.<br>  <br>  Win everything in manager mode with any team:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Pick a team, then start your career. Save your game. Choose "Next Match", <br>  then "Quick Sim". If you win the match, save your progress. If you lose a <br>  match, return to the main menu and load your career again. You can have <br>  as many chances as you want against a team, as the outcome is random <br>  every time.

AA10899706	I am a firearms instructor with 15 years of experience.  In that time, I have run a charity to teach violent crime survivors the basics of self defense.<br>  <br>  The best answer to your question is that every person has their own needs, requirements, and preferences when it comes to choosing a firearm.  For example, there are some people who will denigrate Glock pistols (they sneeringly call them "Tupperware"), while others will praise them to the skies.  The same goes for the offerings from H&K.<br>  <br>  The advantages to the Glock is that it is more corrosion resistent than the H&K, and it is also lighter which will allow for a more comfortable experience when carrying the gun concealed.<br>  <br>  Most of the H&K models, however, allow for a more comfortable shooting experience due to the heavier slide.  This leads to better accuracy for most people, which is important because hitting the target is the whole point to pulling the trigger in the first place.<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest that you call up the firing ranges in your area and ask if they have any guns for rent.  Many ranges will have used models that they will allow you to shoot for a fee, and it is a great way to see for yourself which gun you prefer.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and Email me if you have any further questions.<br>  <br>  James|`|5d0533ba830536f7242b9641ace4fb68aa	Glock is nicely balanced.|`|1c6e1894034acef008f7cd7baf0bdb24aa	Glock....hands down!!!|`|deaeae3264a4471ff41dc77cd707a15baa	I have always preffered the glock to the h&k but over all im a bigger fan of sig sauer

ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	I believe Sony offers a 1 year warranty on its systems. You should check on this ASAP to see if you can get it fixed for free. Otherwise if the problem persists, you may have to pay Sony to fix the system for you. Hope this helps you<br>  <br>  P.S. Make sure its not freezing because your game disc is scratched or otherwise damaged. You can also try cleaning your ps2's disc laser with one of those cleaning discs that have the tiny brush on it.|`|1ea0aa44b40cca5644283b03a0ad2214aa	just hit it a few times works for mine

If your unwilling to pay the insane prices on ebay (and I dont blame you) you're just going to have to wait it out. Most likely the next wave of Ps3's will come out in January or Febuary. Like most console releases Sony didnt make enough, and due to some huge mistakes they had a shortage of Blu-Ray laser components. I highly doubt you'll find a website that has any in stock, and if you do be VERY careful because there's been reports of several fake web stores that have been ripping people off with a false promise of a Ps3. The upside is that if you wait awhile before getting your hands on the console maybe they will have worked out some of the problems that some of the systems have been experiencing. I know it sucks not being able to get one for your bday/christmas and it's really unfortunate that so many people who managed to get one only wanted it to sell for insane prices on Ebay while the people who really wanted it to play themselves are stuck with nothing. Anyways be careful hunting for one and good luck!|`|711b7e3609698368d8be3d37066239f3aa	Rumor is Dec. 12 will be the next big shipment|`|AA10889948	there is no re-release, the stores will get in shipments periodically, check with the stores and ask them when they will get them in, its there job to tell you, btw good luck getting one hahahahaha, just buy a 20gb off ebay for 450 thats what i did and i saved 50 bucks its worth it if u REALLY want one

ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	If you've got $14.00 I'd recommend getting a book titled "Paid to Play: A Insiders Guide To Video Game Careers" It basically details all the different jobs you can get in the industry (including game testing) and how to get the job you want. It's also a pretty fun and interesting book to read even if your just curious about jobs in the video game industry. Be warned though, a very large amount of people would like to get a job like that and because it doesn't require any education it can be very difficult to get into that job in particular. The job itself is not always so great either and def not for everyone.

A second run was to be made, but never happened, and it was abandoned.<br>  <br>  Two glass masters of the 1st run with errors, and subsequent data, as well as data of the release candidate for the fixed version SHOULD be in Sega Samy Holding's posession (unless they destroyed it for some reason).<br>  <br>  Apparently there are some copies of the flawed 1st run floating around, but I have never seen one.  Someone on the old Lik-Sang forum had one, and proved it with unique video footage (one video is even on YouTube).  There are also press review copies available on gold GD-Rs, though I haven't seen one of these either.<br>  <br>  Whoever has one could probably make a small fortune selling it.

7e7e7d77578ac29e9f45959015c16ba7aa	Nintendo will win. Sony is doomed. It had it coming for the longest time, and PS3 was just the jump off the cliff. They haven't hit rock bottom yet, but they are approaching it at light speed. I seriously doubt that they will have enough money to make PS4 after this fiasco. PS3 is just an overpriced heap that may be worth more in 3 years or so, but by that time it will be too late for Sony. Nintendo will resume the crown of the gaming world, just as it did back when it fought Sega (Sega lost and sold itself to Nintendo) and Atari (Nintendo totally made them bankrupt!) and will defeat the Sony just as fast. It does, however, have a long battle coming up with Microsoft now. Microsoft is cheap, and so is Nintendo. Nintendo is fun and has games. So does Microsoft. Who will win? Nintendo. They started the industry, and if need be they will finish it!|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Yeah it sounds familiar.  Looks like it's the repeat of the PSX and PS2.  The PSX used CD, which was new technology at the time.  It only had a few good launch games.  The PS2 used DVD, which was new technology a the time.  The launch titles were crappy, and there weren't that many good games for for quite a few months.  Guess what happened to the PSX and PS2?  It went on to sell over 100 million copies.  The only 2 consoles to ever break the 100 million mark.  The GC had some very good launch titles, and a nice controller.  Guess what happened to the GC?  It lost.  It got spanked. <br>  <br>  If you compare the PS3's first 4 months after launch to the PS2's first 4 months after launch, the PS3 has outsold the PS2 in that time period.  Blu-ray is also outselling HD-DVD by more than a 2 to 1 margin. <br>  <br>  If you think Sony is going to get out of the video game business, you can keep on dreaming.  <br>  <br>  It's only been 4 months since the PS3 and Wii's release, and I wouldn't declare the Wii the winner because it's at least a 4 year battle.<br>  <br>  Nintendo did not put Sega out of business.  It was Sony who put Sega out of business.  The DC couldn't compete with the PS2's sales number, so it went out of business.|`|a2bcc3847a658d6001a7d804dbcd352caa	Don't get ahead of yourself.

O03mUSfyaa	It just depends on where you are at in the game.. If you find something that has a high drop rate, is easily attained (the monster doesn't take long for you to kill), and sells very well then thats your best bet for making a lot of cash. Also STEAL from every single mob.. as that is just an extra item from each mob. Chaining helps too since you get a higher item drop rate.|`|697e4f37d0105ccddd7af626b8752dc6aa	Depends on your level. the stronger your characters are the better you can kill higher level monsters that give out spoils that sell at high prices.

So with also being able to play games on it, makes it a great value.|`|7e7e7d77578ac29e9f45959015c16ba7aa	Because PS3 is crap. Wii and 360 are the future of gaming. If you got PS3, you're screwed. There goes $600 down the drain! for that price, you could have gotten a Wii, Zelda, and 360. Hah. There goes reason! PS: EA has stated that they will focus all their attention on the NEXT generation, not the LAST generation.
aic8vilHaa	Are you running any background programs?Antivirus can cause problems with installing and playing the game.How much memory do you have to?When we got more memory it installed alot faster and didnt stick.Mine would always stick on a jpg file.I would try doing a clean uninstall .Of course backup anything you want to save.Restart,close out uneeded background programs and try installing again.Here are a couple of links that might be helpful.|`|4aec28cfcca86f8759a0fec2f9d6b8bcaa	One option is to try a new cd/dvd drive.  Or try it on another computer, to determine if it's the disc or if it's your computer's fault.<br>  <br>  If it's the disc's fault, try to return it.  Usually stores don't allow returns on software anymore though....<br>  <br>  If it actually works on a different disc drive, then you'll know you need a new disc drive.

06c5c552acbd9dc5428e1dc8c39378c7aa	There are so many expansion packs because the Sims 2 community has demanded for an expanded game. After awhile, the base game becomes very repetitve and boring, EA Games needs a way to keep their customers buying. <br>  <br>  Expansion Packs - Expand upon the original game. <br>  Stuff Packs - Add new objects to the game. These are meant more so for those that don't download custom content into their games. Custom content is user-made mods to The Sims 2 to make it easier to play, more aesthically pleasing, or to simply add something fresh to the game. If you want to look further into custom content then you should go to www.modthesims2.com and browse there. It is one of the top communities for sharing custom content. <br>  <br>  University - This is an expansion pack that basically allows your teenagers to go to college. Many people think this expansion pack is boring, but I'd like to differ. At the university, your sim has an added life stage. They can use the time to boost their skils and get ahead of their neighbors back home. This expansion pack adds three new careers as well as lifetime wants and other elements which many claim to consistently use, even if they rarely take their sims to the actual colleges. <br>  Open For Buisness - Adds new buisnesses. Since you're new to The Sims 2, you would probably find this addition very hard to play. It 's meant more so for gamers who have mastered The Sims 2. However, it adds a few things, such as the ability to have Servo, into your game; making this another fundamental EP, even you never have a buisness. <br>  Seasons - This is the latest expansion pack. It adds weather to your game as well as the ability to garden and fish. They've added the ability to have leftovers and stackable items as well. In my opinion, this is a very nice expansion pack, though it lacks some of the quirky details that the past expansions had. <br>  <br>  Holiday - This is a stuff pack which adds holiday items, specifically Christmas and Hannukah items. It also adds a Santa Claus which comes down your chimney. <br>  Family Stuff - This adds family oriented items. <br>  Celebration - The upcoming stuff pack that will give various party items. <br>  Glamour Life - Adds 'glamorous' items such as new dresses for your sims.|`|bc89b764e969f7f257b8c2f69d3ab6e1aa	sims university allow you to play as a young adult, it adds a new university neighborhood, opens a couple of new jobs. nightlife adds a night life neighborhood, adds features to socialize and parties (like cars, etc). Pets lets sims raise pets. Open for business lets you have a home based business, it can be of bakery, shops, or boutiques.<br>  <br>  The others just adds items. But all the major expansion packs i mentioned above also adds a fair ammount of items.|`|S8H12Wljaa	And Seasons allows it to snow/rain, also adds the temperature effects to the sims, along with gardening, and 6 new careers. By far the best expansion IMO. A must have, for an avid addict.
aic8vilHaa	Probley the best thing you can do is to backup your files.Then do a clean install of everything.I know its a pain but it can make a huge difference.Modthesims2 has a program that will help with it.And you might also want to make sure you dont have a antivirus running when you install.It can also depend on your computer to.On my old computer it would stick on yellow.jpg for 20 mins before it would install.|`|EJh8sef5aa	All of the Sims 2 expansion packs have to be installed in separate folders so make sure you are trying to install the expansion pack in the same folder as the original game.

Play Station 3's freeze alot and dont always play good. And theres more games for xbox.
f25c5daf96ddc3fb933d9cccefd94418aa	Ok, well how about the Cell Processor? The PS3 is basically a powerful supercomputer, and unlike the Xbox 360, will be able to handle bigger and better games. This also ties into Blu-Ray, in that a blu-ray disc has much more storage capacity than a regular DVD, which much it can have way more content in the game, so better graphics, smoother gameplay, more stuff to do. (i know you said no blu-ray, but I assume you only thought it was useful for movies.) <br>  So in the very near future when developers are pushing the envelope as far as next-gen games go, the PS3 will be able to handle it, and the Xbox will not be capable of playing these games. Oblivion is a good example of a big, contentwise game available on both consoles. In the Xbox version, the backgrounds will disappear, gameplay is choppy, etc. whereas on the PS3 the gameplay is very smooth and you can always see the background in full. (I own the PS3 version and have played the 360 one.) The PS3 can simply run faster and process more information than the 360.  This will eventually lead to the Xbox 360 being nearly useless for playing huge games, and the PS3 will be the first choice of game developers.<br>  Not to mention the PS3 is put together a lot better than the Xbox, i've had no problems with my PS3 whatsoever, and my Xbox 360 has had to be repaired, along with the consoles of many, many other Xbox 360 owners.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is, if you want a cheaper, lower quality system that will be good for a year or two, will have Halo 3 and a few other exclusives, and has better online play, get the Xbox 360. If you want a slightly more expensive, higher quality system that will be great for years to come, get the PS3. Personally, I enjoy my PS3 much more than my Xbox 360 already.|`|7696260c065e27737623ffcbae382770aa	it doesnt matter, the xbox 360 is always going to be better than the ps3. sony failed this time

If, on the very, very,very off-chance that you don't have a Phoenix Down, then usefire-magic on it. Either way, it'll be the easiest battle you've faced up until now.ok then he fight is over <br>  see ya

SDOCwFa6aa	You will need to get a proper adapter for the power cord as the plugs in the uk are different.  Other than that it should work as the game programming is all in code and code doesn't care if the machine is in England, Canada, Japan or wherever.

From Lowtown, enter<br>  Garamsythe Waterway, Overflow Cloaca and south exit to Central Waterway<br>  Control. Close the No. 3 and No. 10 controls. South-west exit to No. 3 Cloaca<br>  Spur and activate the No. 1 South Waterway Control south-west of the map.<br>  Return to the Central Waterway Control and open No. 3 and No. 10 before closing<br>  the No. 4 and No. 11 controls. South-east exit to No. 4 Cloaca Spur and<br>  activate the No. 1 North Waterway Control south-east of the map. Return to the<br>  Central Waterway Control and close No. 3 before opening No. 11. South exit to<br>  No. 1 Cloaca and find Cuchulainn south of the map.
fDaKPQSdaa	How To Find: This optional Esper probably has the longest and most boring<br>  sidequest. Just so you know. Now, before you can find Chaos you must've<br>  done the mark hunts where you hunt "Wraith", "White Mousse", and "Orthros".<br>  Once you are done these hunts you may go off on your adventure to find Chaos.<br>  <br>  Go to Old Dalan's house (The old man you visited near the beginning of the<br>  game), and look in his house for a person named "Roh'kenmou". Now, speak to<br>  "Deeg", the person you saw from when you hunted the Wraith. Go inside his<br>  house and look for a Dusty Letter on a table. Now head to the waterway<br>  control system in The Garamsythe Waterway (the semi-circle where you fought<br>  Fireman), and open every control there (turn off the lights from the<br>  objects). You'll now need to open and close the controls in a certain order<br>  in order to proceed.<br>  <br>  1. Close No. 11, close No. 4.<br>  2. Open No. 11.<br>  3. Close No. 3.<br>  4. Open No. 4.<br>  <br>  After you've opened/closed the controls in this order, head to the southern<br>  part of your map. (Stay within the semi-circle with the controls, but look<br>  south). You should examine a light on the floor and you'll recieve a "Dull<br>  Fragment", a Key Item you'll need. If you don't get the examine option,<br>  look for a small white glittery light on the floor, and search around<br>  slowly. When you have the Dull Fragment, proceed to the next paragraph.<br>  <br>  Return to the Old Dalan's house and speak with Roh'kenmou again. Give him<br>  the Dull Fragment (and the Blackened Fragment, which you recieve in one of<br>  the hunts above I've listed). You'll now need to find a person named "Filo"<br>  in Lowtown. He roams the southeastern section of the South Sprawl.<br>  Afterwards, go to the fountain in the Southern Plaza, and look for a<br>  "Curious Woman", and speak with her. Once done, go to the Muthru Bazaar/<br>  Clan Shop "area" and look for some people named "Merchant". There are many<br>  named that, but speak with them all and recieve your orders for the next<br>  steps.<br>  <br>  Now you'll need to run over to the Magick shop. Once there, look around for<br>  an Imperial and have a little chat with him. Afterwards look for Kytes in<br>  the northern section of Lowtown. Go and talk with Filo now. Now find the<br>  Imperial in the magick shop, and you'll get another fragment. It's called<br>  the "Grimy Fragment". Give Roh'kenmou the fragment, and he'll disappear.<br>  <br>  You'll find Roh'kenmou in the Magick shop in Archades. Head over there and<br>  speak with him. Now head to Old Archades and look for a man named "Otto"<br>  found in The Alley of Mutated Sighs. You'll now recieve the Moonsilver<br>  Medallion from him. Give it to Roh'kenmou. Head to the Nabreus Deadlands.<br>  <br>  Go to the area "The Slumbermead", and look northwest and try to find a hidden<br>  path. If you have troubles finding the secret path, try making your<br>  characters run northwest across the area, you should find it eventually.<br>  Walk across the secret path and exit the map area. Head west to another exit<br>  from the area. From there, head northwest up the mountain (becareful here,<br>  there are a lot of skeletons here, progress slowly and kill them all if you<br>  need to). Look for a shrine and after some events you'll get two medallions.<br>  The Lusterless Medallion and The Medallion of Love. Don't worry, it gets a<br>  slight bit more excited, with fighting rather than talking to people.<br>  <br>  Now, save your game, you'll need to face two easy bosses in order to fight<br>  Chaos. Head to the Necrohol of Nabudis, and go to "The Hall of the Ivory<br>  Covenant", and look for a "Door of Loathing". You'll face Fury, if you want<br>  advise on this boss see his section on help on how to defeat him, but he<br>  should be quite easy to defeat.<br>  <br>  Now, go to the area "Cloister of Distant Songs" (we're still in the<br>  Necrohol), and look east for a a "Door of Horrors". You'll face another easy<br>  boss named "Humbaba". Defeat him and read the next paragraph.<br>  <br>  You'll recieve a Medallion of Might, used to acess Chaos' room. Save your<br>  game and return to the Necrohol of Nabudis. Go to the area "Cloister of the<br>  Highborn", and then use your new medallion on the Door of Despair to finally<br>  be able to fight this optional Esper.

XBLQI2i3aa	I don't believe that there is anything out there like that. Trust me you'll love Guitar Hero anyway you should just get it haha.

Wz9SqiTXaa	relinquished deck... old school.<br>  <br>  First of all, allow me to state clear that there is NO WAY a relinquished deck can be tier 1. It won’t be able to beat top decks in current meta such as DAD, G-beasts, lightsworn, monarchs, etc. on a constant basis.<br>  However, it can be somewhat competitive and fun if you built it properly with few tricks. <br>  <br>  Deck strength<br>  Relinquished is a great monster!!! It shares damage, steals your opponent’s monsters, and is a special summon!!<br>  Relinquished is a LEVEL 1 monster!!! Great, because you can stall with Gravity Bind, Level Limit Area B!!! They stall for you while your Relinquished can run havoc on his life points!!!<br>  <br>  Deck weakness<br>  It is a weak monster with 0 ATK and DEF… although able to take on the ATK and DEF of “captured” monsters, when it takes a face-down; it is still 0/0. When it takes a hit, your LPs WILL get hurt. .. a lot. Even with the share damage effect, it is still NOT a good deal when you are lower than him.<br>  <br>  It is, unfortunately, a ritual monster…. Meaning you will at least spent a whapping THREE(3) cards in your hand to summon it…(inculding relinqished itself; "Advanced ritual Technique" should not be used since it requires you to run at least one level 1 NORMAL monster in your deck... last time i check they all SUCK!! imaging if you draw into 1 of that in your first hand....) Yugioh, in my opinion, is a number’s game. Until your life is really low( usually below 1000), it is cards you control( cards on the field, in hand combined) that matters absolutely the MOST!!!   Now lets do the math: you use 2 cards to summon relinquished, that’s -2; take away one of his monster, -1 for him, he kills it with a spell/trap : -1 for both of you.  Card advantage score: -3 for you , -2 for him… not good.   That is presume he did not chain “book of moon” to your steal effect which cancels it and turns it into a 0/0 face down monster…<br>  <br>  Also, being a ritual means that you MUST draw all the necessary pieces in order to ritual summon it. That is 3 different cards… The tribute monster is easy because relinquished is a 1 star monster. However, other two parts: relinquish itself and black illusion ritual is hard even if you run 3 copies of each. <br>  <br>  Cards to get:<br>  <br>  Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands 1400/1000: When this card is Normal Summoned or Flip Summoned, you can select 1 Ritual Monster Card or 1 Ritual Spell from your Deck and add it to your hand.  This is a must at 3 per deck!!! The reason is obvious: to search out Relinquished and Black illusion Ritual. It is a +1 automatically if you successfully summon it. <br>  <br>  Sonic Bird/ Senju of the Thousand Hands: They have the same stats as the manju. The difference is that the bird give you a search on ritual magic ONLY while the senju searches ONLY for ritual monsters.  I personally would run 2 birds and 1 senju since you have additional ways to search out Relinquished via Sangan.<br>  <br>  Contract with the Abyss<br>  (Spell/Ritual)<br>  This card is used to Ritual Summon any Dark Monster. You must also offer monsters from the field or you hand whose total Level Stars equal the Level Stars of the Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon. Run 1 of this to increase your chance of drawing the Ritual spell card. Notice you MUST offer level exactly the same (not OVER!!!) to summon. I will get to that later… you will see the reason behind this. <br>  <br>  Gravity Bind/ Level Limit Area B/Swords of Revealing Light/Messenger of Peace: stall at all cost!!! These cards shuts down most decks’ most monsters while you are free to attack!!! Since first 3 are all limited cards, run 1 of each. Max out on Messengers.<br>  Crush Card Virus: Expansive as hell…. But if you could afford it(or trade for it), you MUST have it. Relinquished is DARK,0/0 with no equipped monster or sucks a face down. <br>  Solemn Judgment: Relinquished is a heavy investment that must be allowed to pay for itself. That means the above mentioned 3 for 2 deals should not happen too often. Also, it will be a disaster if your opponent destroys your back field swords and gravity bind. <br>  <br>  Wave Motion Cannon: yes, you can not win with relinquished alone.(if your opponent is any kind of a decent player, you won’t) You have stall cards, and a monster-stealing monster so this card is great choice. Keep him pinned and make him count down to his doom!!!<br>  <br>  Cards you could get but ok if you don’t<br>  <br>  Phantom of Chaos: it mimics any monster effect at the cost of remove that monster in the graveyard. It inflects no BATTLE damage to your opponent. I am not sure that share damage is definitively effect damage. Still you can summon it, have it mimic relinquished and hijack his monsters for kicks.  At the end phase, the effect disappears and that “jacked” monster is going to die. More good news for you if it is backed up by CCV.<br>  <br>  Arcana Force 0 –The Fool: This is an odd choice. It is a 0/0 level 1 light monster that can not be switched to defense mode unless with a card effect. Sounds bad? Not totally. It can not be destroyed in battle: great for stall. Also LEVEL 1. Remember contract with abyss? Just don’t summon it, set it face down so they attack to flip it up already in defense mode. <br>  <br>  Fulfillment of Contract: This card allows you to pay 800 points to summon 1 ritual monster that HAS BEEN PROPERLY RITUAL SUMMONED BEFORE from YOUR graveyard.  A premature burial for rituals. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, here is how I will make this deck <br>  Monster 19<br>  3 relinquished<br>  3 menju<br>  2 sonic bird <br>  1 senju<br>  1 sangan<br>  3 the fool<br>  1 reaper<br>  1 marshmallow <br>  2 mask of darkness<br>  2 des lacooda<br>  Spell 12<br>  3 Black illusion ritual<br>  2 book of moon <br>  1 reborn<br>  1 premature<br>  3 wave motion <br>  3 messenger of peace<br>  1 level limit area B<br>  1 swords <br>  Trap 10<br>  1 Crush card virus<br>  3 solemn judgment<br>  1 gravity bind<br>  1 mirror force<br>  3 dark bribe<br>  1 torrential<br>  <br>  5 stall monsters and 6 stall trap/spell should keep you alive for very long unless against superior hand and deck types. Lacooda helps you with draws while masks help you reclaim important protection traps such as solemn and dark bribe. <br>  <br>  Books are for a bit defense recycling relinquished’s monster stealing ability by flip it face down on his end phase and flip summon it again next turn.( it also can be used to reuse menju/bird/senju’s search ability although I strongly recommend against it unless you have significant advantage.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember, the idea is not attacking with relinquished and reduce his life to 0. Rather, it is steal his monsters away and burn his life with wave motion. Bonus for you if you can take few thousand points from your attacks with relinquished or share the damage.|`|5Bp5pavYaa	thousand eyes restrict and thousand eyes idol r cards that made this deck good but then ude made a thing called a ban lsit<br>  <br>  <br>  and banned thousnad eyes restrict<br>  <br>  so tear reliquished deck apart man|`|2d10b1970d445179cd3cd92d0a527d9eaa	give me Lily....and add a thausend Eye relinquished orwhatever its called|`|XV3OBOr7aa	Ok well heres a useful combo.

Just complete 2 out of the 3 rival gang missions.  |`|9R0bSGKIaa	The only way to improve it is by completing parts of the game. they should have mentioned this as i spent 20 odd minutes searching the base.
E48JPEkMaa	1 red light? u sure its not 3 because if it is 3 then you need to use your warrenty. if just one red light then:<br>  Try the following to resolve the problem:<br>  1. Turn off your Xbox 360 console, disconnect and reconnect all cables, and then turn your Xbox 360 console back on. If this step doesn't resolve the problem, try step 2.<br>  2. Turn off the console, and then disconnect any connected accessories, such as controllers, Xbox 360 memory units, and the Xbox 360 hard disk.

That's what i did when mine gave three rings about a year ago, did this and it has worked fine since.|`|AA10295089	Okay mate, you have the (RROD) Red Ring of Death... Your system is dead mate. You have to have the original packaging and send it to microsoft and they will send u a BRAND new one. If u threw away your box.. You're screwed mate.|`|JcODibBxaa	im not sure but i think one red light means not all of the cables are plugged in properly, I might be wrong though, Hope this helps =]

AA10737158	    You don't download games into your DS. When you want to play a specific game, you need the game card. <br>      The "Download  Play" option is for certain games. Sometimes you might want to play with someone on a multiplayer game, but don't actually own the game. Some games can temporarily send you a bit of the game just so you can play multiplayer with others. Once you turn off your DS, the game is gone (you can no longer play it) until you download it again. <br>      I hoped that I answered your questions.|`|7vKXYjUtaa	are you talkin about ds download play...dats sort of like linking with other people rather than downloading games...im not really sure though but ya i dont think u really can download game..<br>  <br>  ....linking is like wen u play mario cart ds wit a guy who has da game but u dont n u want to play it den go press ds download play while the other guy presses multiplayer n single card sumtin and in uur screen it will say mario cart ds n click on it n u can play mario cart wit him..<br>  <br>  ..oh ya if u go to a store where it says u can download demos or sumtin u can do ds download play n u can play miltiple demos|`|xjxPv7a8aa	you need a nintendo wii to download games. (they are only trials) you can also connect with another DS and play together when you click that setting.(you have to be kind of close). Hope this helps!|`|Y6DAVGVLaa	you need another friend with the game then press download game when you are connected|`|AA10295089	Okay the download play option isnt to dl games, its to dl a trial version of a game ur friend has to play multiplayer with him. If only it was that awesome.

1WTKiGjRaa	You need a router, a switch, or a hub to system link with more than two Xboxes.  You can get these at any store that sells computer items. I.E. Office Depot, Office Max, Best Buy, Walmart, and many more<br>  If you ever plan on going on xbox live with your systems I would highly suggest getting a router rather than the other two alternatives.  It is a little more expensive but a good router will not lag when you have more than one Xbox on Xbox Live|`|AA10295089	Get a splitter, Making 2 1.
Tk29jePpaa	Agreed just go to the demo download area and you can download it for free, without a code.|`|AA10409800	COD World at War Beta MP is available through XBOX Live now.  You don't need a code.  Just go to the marketplace and download.
Nq4ZlznNaa	the public demo came out 5 days after the demos for the pre ordered people so you can download it... the game is simply fantastic... i always played resident evil games but its just single player... but l4d is coop and zombie horde! its awesome|`|AA10409800	Played it last night.  Had a great time.  Really fun, and I would imagine a blast to play with other people.  I think that there's enough game play available to keep that interest in the game going once the campaign is complete--and with most first-person shooters, that's not the case.|`|jID6KYXdaa	you don't need to reserve it to get the demo. the public demo came out today (11/12/08)|`|zmab07Giaa	it blows my mind in so many ways
