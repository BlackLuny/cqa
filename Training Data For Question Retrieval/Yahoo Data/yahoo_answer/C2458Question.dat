20090304162348AA2jkZ4	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you go about getting a table-top game thingy published?	As incredibly geeky as it must be I have managed to write up an entire pen&paper type of game which I am still expanding on a bit. If you don't know what that is think D&D and you'll have the rough concept down.      I made it while bored at a friends house because they were taking too long to do something and it was intended just to be a short alternate setting or method of killing time, in the end it is now over 150 pages and still expanding a bit and tested for perfection etc.      While I just did it to pass time because I was bored my friend is (consistently) nagging me to try and get it published or something and so I was wondering out to get this particular type of book published because it's not exactly a normal book.      I've tried hunting around the net for some idea of where to get started on that but the companies I know that publish these types of things aren't exactly helpful in making them as they don't generally expect anyone to make a new one entirely it seems.      Just looking for some advice from here.

20090304172326AAboF0b	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The Easiest Question EVER?	I'm writing a book about a poor teenager who moves in with distant rich relatives. This is a first draft(next draft I'm going to add more details, change a lot of words, and spell check) of some of a chapter I wrote where the main character meets with his cousin Leon, who becomes his mentor sort of in the book, but is this good?         "You must be Kurt, I'm Leon." a voice said assertively. "Let me tell you a little bit about my family, okay?"       I just stared at his forehead, he had a "p" shape birthmark on his forehead, it was hard to avoid it.      "Look at my eyes when I'm talking to you, it's a birthmark not a damn tattoo." he yelled      I immediately tooknotice of his sharp blue eyes, "Okay,sorry"I replied, "Please tell me about your family."      "Well my dad's a major real estate agent, so as you can see we're rich, my mom's dead, died of a overdose, no big deal." he said it in a cold hearted tone, as if his family suffered so much he could no longer feel pain. "I have four brothers, three sisters; my oldest brother Lucius doesn't come around, after he turned twenty one he just left, my secound oldest brother Carl comes home from college every now and then. Oscar told me he meet you so I don't have to tell you about that fat ****, and call him Fatty if you want. Morgan..." I interrupted      "Why do you hate him?"      "Who?" Leon look surprisingly puzzled.      "Oscar, you called him 'fat ****', I bet if he heard you call him that it'd hurt him"      "He's used to it" he replied and continued, "Morgan is my oldest sister, by two years, she finished high school a year ago and I doubt she'll go to college after summer's over, she's such a brat she'll probably leech off my dad til he dies." He had an instant smile on his face, "Sarah is a plastic surgery *****, I have to tell you this..." he paused and laughed a little. "Ever since we were kids she had always wanted to look like a super model, when we were teenagers she wanted plastic surgery to look like some popular girl in school, but my dad told her to wait until she was eighteen to have cosmetic surgery. When her eighteen birthday came she gave her face a major reconstruction, now she's nineteen and has changed her face at least three times."      "Wow." I said in astonishment, "Do you have a picture of her, I'm curious on how she looks now."      "Nope, but go in her room, there's a gold picture frame with a picture of her in it" he walked outside my room and pointed, "Her room is far down the hallway, first door on the left." He then left sight.

20090304195532AAjxdYj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hamlet essay help, please read?	please read my essay and tell me what you think.   its based on the theories or ian johnston.      The Evil Condition of the World Displayed in Hamlet          Shakespear's Hamlet is a profound work of art completely worthy of the praise       and popularity that it has been granted over the time of it's existence. The play, while an      acclaimed tragedy, still encompasses love, passion, betrayal, but above all, revenge.  As      a young Prince attempting to cope with the harsh reality of his father's murder by his own       uncle, Hamlet is grated compassion by the reader almost immediatley. As the reader       begins to learn more about Hamlet, his situation and the town of Elsinore as a whole, the       once compassionate feelings turn to ones of disgust.  The twisted plot alone captures      the evil and corrupt state of the world at the given time.         Hamlet's father was killed by his uncle, his father's brother, Claudius. Cladius then       took Hamlet's father's heir to the thrown by marrying Hamlet's mother, Cladius' sister-in-      law. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, and the ghost tells him of the horrible      murder and how it took place. Having to live with all of these horrible atrocities       surrounding him, Hamlet's emotions are left stunted, to the point where he feel's it       necessary to lash out at his mother on numerous occasions and also plot to kill Cladius       for murdering his father.        The town of Elsinore, however only fuels the fire in Hamlet's soul even more.        The town is completely run on trickery, deceit and lies causing it's inhabitants to sneak       and snoop around in order to get ahead.  Polonious, the father of Ophelia, a woman       that Hamlet involves himself with as an emotional outlet, is the master of Elsinor's       Machiavellian tactics and ends up costing him his life as he spies on an encounter       between Hamlet and Gertrude, his mother. Polonius makes himself heard from behind       a curtian and Hamlet stabs him through it, thinking that it was Cladius who he had killed.      Polonious' death causes his daughter Ophelia to go completely mad in his absence.       While being opressed by Hamlet and his hurtful, mixed signals, Ophelia       harbors comfort in her father and when she hears of his death, takes her own life out of       insanity.  In this situation, however, Ophelia cannot be blammed for her actions simply       because it was the awful condition of the world around her tat brought her to be the way       that she eneded up.        The ambiguous characterization of Hamlet leaves the reader's mind open for       interpretation as one reads. Hamlet's words and actions may seem harsh, immature or mad       at times, yet in knowing his circumtances and sitation, the reader cannot truley despise       him. The reader knows that even in the vularity of his behavior, it is passion that drives       him; Be it the passionate love he has for his mother, the passionate hatred he has towards       Cladius or the passionate drive to live above the terrible and treacherous motives in       Elsinore.        Claudius' motives are also worth discussing in the debate of a truley evil world.      While Cladius is loving to Gertrude, and a good King, he nevertheless cheated his way to       the throne. The unthinkably evil acts that he committed to achieve his position of power      are so truley torqued from righteousnes that only the condition of the world and acts       around him could have influenced him so tremendously. In the play, Cladius does begin       to feel sorry for his actions, seeking help and forgiveness from God, however, his       attempts show that it is too late and that the deed is done and gone.       In Hamlet, Gertrude is a charater that is often overlooked when thinking of evil       motives. Gertrude instead plays mostly victim to Hamlet's outbreaks of terror and       maddness, resulting in her emontional struggle of whether she is in the wrong to have      Cladiius as her Husband.  She truely loves both Hamlet and Claudius, but the two of them       are wrestling with the wirld that she seems to have atop her shoulders. Life is way too       much for her to handle. All that she seems to want is the simple pleasure of a happy,       connected family, yet life is denying her that, no matter how she tries.        Be it looking for love and comfort like Ophelia and Gertrude, power like Cladius,      a logical explaination and romantic revenge like Hamlet or playing into the evils of the       world around him like Polonius, the world of Elsinore in Hamlet is one of epic defeat.       The constant struggle to rise above is perished by the ever-growing evil and corruption of       the world around.

20090304181727AAK2iP2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think? Novel?	Preface      The pain seared into my skin. How could this pain be so important? I couldn’t understand. I screamed for someone to help me. Some of the girls turned away and covered their ears. The guys just looked solemn. Worst of all, my own mother would not help me. I looked with fear with what life I had left. I slowly went into the cold darkness.      Chapter 1- The Moving   I fumbled to get the seatbelt or whatever you call it off. My mother was getting irritated with me stuck in my seat. “Yes!!" I said. "Finally." When we got to the airport, I went smack into the vending machine. "Eeep!!" I squeaked before I went down. "Ugh, what am I going to do with you, Victoria?" My mother inquired. I laughed. "It's your fault that you conceived me, mom." She picked me up with no effort. "Another trip to my personal office", my mother sighed while saying. “How did you slam into the machine anyway?" I was trying to get out of the airport before they closed." I said      "You and your fears, and it's only 3:00 in the afternoon!"   "But... But...”   " C’mon." my mother said. “You stay close to me, you understand? I don't want you to smack right into the window next." She chuckled. She thinks she's funny but she's not. She is kinda like me only she's calmer, most of the time anyway.      I shook my head, trying to get the stars out. My name is Victoria and I am Asian. Some stupid racists people have made fun of me for it and as the result, I punched them very hard.      We walked out of the airport without me getting more injuries. "Where is the house?" "Be quiet" my mother said with a stern voice. "Ok. TAXI!!!!" my mother screamed. It had seemed that all the windows broke at the start my mother yelled. She has a VERY loud and high pitched voice. I have the same genes which did not help me during high school tryouts to be singing. One thing about my voice that is different with hers is that I can actually sing. But sometimes her genes take over and then I have to be sent home with a bill attached to my homework.      A taxi cab came and we entered. The taxi man looked scared as if my mother was going to scream her head off. She handed the place she wanted to go. The man shut the window that was the only thing we had to talk to him. I gave her a pity look which I had PLENTY of. "What?" my mom obviously did not get the fact that she scared the man out of his wits. "Nothing" She looked at me with skepticism like she was trying to read my thoughts.      The man stopped the car abruptly; so hard I bumped my head on the window. I yelped. My mother didn't say anything; she just shook her head. My mother's Asian name is Mei, but her American name is Linda. My mother didn't say anything. She was probably thinking about the home and our future. I wasn't surprised that she would buy a mansion what with how much money would make each year.       We took our luggage without the taxi man’s help. After all the things were out, the car sped off, without the tip. “Huh” I rolled my eyes. We faced the house. Now it wasn't really a house but a mansion. "Whoa" I said amazed at the size.   I know I need work.   The story is about Victoria finding out she's a demon and even more surprising, a half-demon..

20090304185931AAjhMzR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of the description to my story? Also how do you publish a book?	Hey everyone. I posted somthing like this last week, but i'd like more opinions. I’m 12 and writing a book called Shatter. Its about a young girl named Jane who has the abilities to read minds, and control fire. There is a group called the Pandamonia who rid the world of people with abilities who seem to causing trouble. Jane doesn't know how to control her power of fire and she accidentally sets fire to a town. The Pandamonia come after Jane and her family who also have abilities. Her family all die trying to protect Jane, who makes it out alive. she is adopted at the age of 8. she lives with her adopted family for 5 years but soon realizes that she can not live with knowing that the people who killed her family are still alive. Full of rage and hate she leaves her adopted family in search of a man with the same ability as her hoping to learn to control her powers so she can kill the Pandamonia. On her search she is chased by members of the Pandamonia. She also encounters Seth a 13 year old boy who has powers similar to Jane's. He too hates the Pandamonia for killing his family. Together they search for the man who can help them and train with him for several months. After months of training Jane and Seth decided that they are ready to go on their search to find the main Headquarters of the Pandamonia. While on the search, Jane and Seth develop a passionate love for each other that they will not admit. After weeks of searching they final find the Headquarters.  The are severely outnumbered and are captured and placed in jail cells. While being held in the cells they learn that the Pandamonia don't kill all of their victims. Some they keep as test subject and others as fighters. Does this mean that Jane and Seth's family members may still be alive? Then how did the Pandamnoia make it look like they all died? Was it an illusion, or did they bring them back to life? If so then how will they save their families? And more importantly how will they help them escape? They are bound to the Pandamonia. They can find them anywhere and whoever tries to escape is tortured mentally, which is caused by microchips implanted in their heads. The Pandamonia can control anyone once the microchip is implanted in their heads.  Jane and Seth don’t have the chip yet so they are not under the Pandamonia’s control. The only way for them to save their families is to kill the man who controls all the microchips. But he won’t be easy to kill. He is the strongest of the Pandamonia and posses a numerous amount of powers. If they can save their families will they be able to save themselves?      This is the description. Tell me what you think. I appreciate all comments. This is not going to be the only book in the series. there will probably be two more. I'm not yet done with the first one though. When i do get done how will i publish it and how do i find an agent and editor? Will people want to publish a book writen be a 12 year old?      Thanks for all your help! =)

20090304223622AAnIua1	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Is my grandfather is the wrong?	Today I was over my grandfather's home and I accidentally spilled oil over the garage floor. He said that it took him months to get the concrete poured in the garage. Before I spilled the oil on the floor it was neat looking. When I spilled the oil and tried to clean it up he ran in the garage and started yelling at me. I told him that I was sorry and I will try to clean it up. A few minutes later he came at me again. Talking about the garage. He said that I was disrespectful and rude. I was a hard head. I was not going to argue with an adult so I just laid down on the couch turned on the mechanical fan and dose of to sleep. About thirty minutes later he came back into the room and turned the fan off making me real angry. I just grabbed a pillow and hit him with it. He came back at me with a slap on the face.  So I pushed him. He grabbed me by my arm and squeeze it really hard until it was bruised. The only thing I done was sat down and think about the situation. I love my grandfather but sometimes he makes me a little angry. Should I speak to him and apologize for what I have done. I feel really bad and sad for the fact that I am only 16 years old. If my step father finds out he is going to be pissed. I was told to never to disrespect grown ups. I believe that I done disrespect. My mom always told me to be polite.

What will our reputations   be that will outlive us?         Some of the things are hard to understand, but what i gathered so far was that it is about living in a world we dont care for and how humans will not be remembered by anything but their reputation.      Is that even close to what the poem is saying? What is the general theme portrayed in the poem? Is it that the passing of time destroys everything? Is the theme similar to ozymandius?

So I didn’t make a choice, I stopped living; and started in a way.”   He looked at me quizzically. “But you’re happy, and you live?” There was no more snow falling, it had turned into a light drizzle that was slowly soaking my dress.   “I live differently than I want to.” I stared into his deep brown eyes sparkling in the moonlight. “I don’t trust anyone; no one. They all let you down.” I answered simply. “The last time I trusted someone, I got moved to another school; another family.” I closed my eyes, shoving the tears away; I was not going to do that here.   “Another family?”   “I never spent one Christmas with my real parents, not one.” I opened my eyes and he had moved a little bit closer to me out of the dark. “They always had somewhere better to go; some place better to visit where I wasn’t in the way. They enjoyed each other, and I was the burden.” I stared off into the distant tree’s remembering countless times I had to stay with other people over Christmas.   “But…”    “I spent one Christmas with this friend; his cousin came to visit and spent a few nights. I asked him not to, I tried…” I stopped knowing I couldn’t finish the sentence.   “What are you talking about?” And then suddenly I was immerged into another memory, and I began to speak the thoughts of that memory out loud, as if I was feeling them again.   “I asked him to stop; I wanted him to just stop. Everything about him, every single piece…every smell…like beer and cigarettes, mixed with some strange cologne. And his breath was hot, like a fire…I just wanted him to stop…I just wanted him to stop…” I fell off the swing onto the ground, my heart pounding faster as I was back in that place, in that bed. “…I just wanted him to stop…” My cries muffled my words, I was almost positive he didn’t hear the last part of what I said.    In moments I was wrapped in his arms, everything I was sure about, everything that hurt; it was all laid out for him to see, every broken piece of me, every hole I had perfectly hidden, and imperfection I tried to hide; he could see it all.    And I hated it.   “Why another family?” He asked quietly.   “No one believed me, not even my parents. The only person who believed me was my friend, and what good would that have done? Two fifteen year olds who despised their parents? I was a liar already, at least to my parents.” I pushed myself away from him, and back up. “I was nothing to them, and I still am nothing!” I shouted, “I’m nothing to anyone!”   He stood up and grabbed my face in his hands gently, “you’re something to me.” His lips pressed firmly against mine and I couldn’t pull away, not even if I wanted to. I wrapped my arms around his neck, pressing myself against him. He was gentle but firm and I wanted nothing more than this moment. It tore me apart knowing why he was doing this, and I pulled away.   “I’m sorry…I just…I can’t.”
20090304231344AA3XipJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A question about something I'm writing?	okay this is a little piece of something that I'm writing, I have yet to edit it therefore there are probably spelling errors and comma misplacements. run-on sentences and such, please dont be too harsh, I just want to know if you would read more???            ...and then someone walking up the stairs. I tried moving away from the window but there wasn’t enough time, the door burst open before I was far enough away.   It was Dwayne; the anger displayed on his face was powerful.   “What did you do!” he shouted striking me in my face. I fell to the floor and didn’t answer there wasn’t anything I could say; it would all warrant him hitting me again.   “Leave her alone.” I heard Jack come into the room. I looked up to see Dwayne glare at Jack as he kicked me in the stomach.   “You stupid *****!” he shouted again, and there was another kick. I couldn’t breathe anymore and I couldn’t scream; I honestly just wished he would shoot me with the gun in his hand; it would be much simpler than this. Jack charged him and pushed him away from me.   “I said leave her alone.”    “Stay out of this Jack. It doesn’t concern you.”   “Leave her alone.” He picked me up off the floor and whispered, “I’m getting you out of here, even if it kills me.” He pulled me against his side. But before I knew it I was back on the floor and Jack was against the wall across the room.   “Get your *** out of here Jack, before you do something you will regret!”   Jack pushed Dwayne away from him and came back over to me; he knelt down beside me and brushed the hair out of my face.   I could barely see either one of them anymore, and then there was another kick to my stomach. I cried out this time, grasping at any sort of hope. Dwayne knelt down beside me and covered my mouth with his hand. “SHUT UP!” he growled.

20090304231008AACB7kB	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	If you were a teachr what grade would you give me on this and why?	1. The main character in the story is Katharina; it is her because the plot is to “tame her” because she is “shrewish and curst” and no one really wants to marry her, but someone has to before anyone can marry her younger sister. There are several others who I guess could be the main characters’, but I am pretty sure it is Katrina.   2. The secondary characters’ in the story are Petruchio, Lucentio, Tranio, Germio, Vincentio, Baptisa, and Bianca. (in the induction it is Sly and a Lord) Petruchio was Katharina’s suitor, Lucentio and Germio are both Bianca’s suitors, Bianca is Katharina’s sister, and Baptisa is her father.   3. I do not really relate to Katharina because she is waaaaaaaaaaaay to mean. But then again when I think about it I remember how she got so jealous of her sister who had so many suitors while she currently had none, and it reminds me of how jealous I got of my sister when she got some new clothes and I didn’t. Also I see one of my old teachers in her because they were both unreasonably mean.   4. The most important event that takes place during the story is after Katharina and Petruchio are married, Petruchio starts acting even more shrewish than Katharina and therefore “tames her”. It changes the story because it changes Katharina’s personality.   5. The ending of the story was surprising because while I knew in the end Katharina would be “tamed” I did not know that the “Widow” and Bianca would be meaner than Katharina.   6. The time and setting effect the story because nowadays Bianca would not have gone to the highest bidder and no one would have cared if Katharina was married because they could have simply married Bianca with or without her father’s permission.   7. The overall lesson to this story seems to be fight fire with fire. Because in order to tame Katharina, Petruchio had to become a shrew himself.   8. I was happy when I read this book because some parts were pretty funny. But I felt scared when Petruchio started yelling at his servants- because… it was scary!   9. If I could ask the author one question about the book I would ask him what happened to the ending because according to the foot notes there was a epilogue where Sly falls asleep and the Lord puts him back where he found him and when he wakes he thinks of the whole experience as a dram and sets off to tame his own wife. But it was lost from the text of the play.   10. I would rate this play as awesome because it’s funny, it makes sense somewhat it’s a page turner and it is somewhat of a challenge to read, because of the language. I would defiantly recommend this book to a friend because lately they have been reading some really stupid books with no value what so ever- but this is an all around good book.                        PLEASE NOTE-   my teacher does NOT care about spelling, grammar, or weather or not we answered th questions in a comlete sentence.   all he cares about is if we read the book or not and how well we payed attention to it.   this is a normal freshman english class, BUT the honors english class DID just get done reading it.... but it was a complete coincidence- they are in a shakesphere unit and i just like to read

20090304225740AADRrYH	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	"Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond imagination?"?	‘Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond imagination. It is our light more than our darkness which scares us. We ask ourselves – who are we to be brilliant, beautiful, talented, and fabulous. But honestly, who are you to not be so?      You are a child of God, small games do not work in this world. For those around us to feel peace, it is not example to make ourselves small. We were born to express the glory of god that lives in us. It is not in some of us, it is in all of us. While we allow our light to shine, we unconsciously give permission for others to do the same. When we liberate ourselves from our own fears, simply our presence may liberate others.’      - Marianne Williamson in Return to Love: Reflections on a Course in Miracles      Is this true? I find it hard to believe as most of my fears are deeply rooted in all my negative qualities. I'm searching but I can't seem to find any truth in this quote. How about you all?

Is there such a thing as semantic differences in philosophy? Or are all terms intrinsic to their respective meanings so that two different ideas were said in similar fashion?

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black   And the dark street winds and bends.   Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow   We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,   And watch where the chalk-white arrows go   To the place where the sidewalk ends.      Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,   And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,   For the children, they mark, and the children, they know   The place where the sidewalk ends.          what literary devices are used? what is the meter? foot? allusions? metaphors? what does it talk about/summary?
20090305003825AAxe50g	Arts & Humanities;History	Regarding a particular victim of WWI...I was wondering if this is a true story?	Based on Metallica's video.  although they were addressing how they were against WWII, they used a WWI incident/victim without limbs & his sense (taste, sight, etc.).  the victim wished to be killed, but was denied his request and was eventually sold off by the father as a freak.  my teacher explained this to me, and it appears so tragic.  i was wondering if this is true?

20090305004625AApnQBo	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Is trying to obtain each parent's names through birth certificates of each person an effective method?	I'm planning on ordering my great-grandparent's birth and death certificates soon. I know all there names. I know most of their birth dates and when most died. I know the names of some of my great-great grandparents (mostly last names). Obviously, those who can trace there roots in America the longest have the best advantage, since the records are most easy to obtain here. But is this an adequate way of trying to find out who everyone is?Minding fees, are records from nineteenth century Italy, Ireland and Spain easily obtainable?  Based on American records though, is information on their parents listed on each birth certificate? Are the places where they born on it too? Are the parent's birthplaces too?      I'll probably start out by ordering just one, than seeing where that takes me. I don't want to waste my money if it's not going to give me a reasonable chance at finding what I'm looking for.

20090305013830AAzAr3o	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you ever get that feeling?	You know, I have a strange feeling now.   I can't stop thinking that I'm not me.   This sense of 'me' is so strange   I feel this personality is not even mine sometimes.   These thoughts, how can they be mine?   I often make no effort to think yet still, thoughts flow unrelentingly.    My emotions are strange, even them, I don't know.   I feel empty.   Like when my grandmother died and I didn't cry.   I feel this life is not my life.   I feel no purpose at all really.   I am not depressed.. no I don't think so.   I know love, and I love.      But still, what is this 'me?'   what is this 'mine?'   I have a funny feeling in my chest sometimes.   Like when you hug someone and your hearts embrace and merge as one.   But I don't see anyone else   it seems like everything is dissolving   I like when it dissolves   but even more,   I'd like to dissolve......      Do you understand?   Do you feel it too?   Can we dissolve?   Can we not fight anymore?   Can we surrender our egos to love?      I'm still weeping,   I'm still prostrating at your feet,   I'm still shinning in bliss,   I am all these things.      I feel strange these days.   I know not why to go on.   But I do, simply because I know not why to stop.      I am a feather in the wind,   I am a twig in the stream,   I am a sinking stone in the sea.   I am all these things,   and I am no things.
20090305020916AA2TuMU	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My poems in this section never get commented on =/?	I wrote this a few weeks ago and I would really appreciate any comments/suggestions you have for me, I know it is long. I am 14 and I love writing.      My heart aches.      When I listen, eyes pour and mind just wonders.   Mind doesn't know why, but eyes spill water.   It's strange watching body convulse, tighten, flinch, release.   Fists and swords and knives torment.   Every time I let heart free, I am shredded.      I am strapped to the rack and torn to bits   and my eyes clench, and pop, and spill.      My heart aches like opposite magnets.   All that is wanted is a one-hundred and eighty degree flip,   liberating tension,   in union.      First though, I guess,   all the shackles have to be slashed.      Still mind looks on in wonder.   As I lay mind aside and let heart unravel, untwist, and spill itself,   something projects, and unleashes itself onto my seismograph body.   Mind knows not why, and heart never knows.   Heart just is, and body translates and works out.      I experience body twist, and writhe, and finally – still.   finally still   so still   just still      This alchemy is real.   For when I unleash mind-bound heart,   when I take off the shackles,   rust turns to gold,   turns to platinum,   turns to light.      And there is clarity.   And there is light.         Now though, heart aches.   And I know,   It's time to unshackle.   It's time to put mind aside   - and be.

I believe art needs to return to its Renaissance era. What are your opinions?

It's about a lycanthrope and she meets a guy but I don't know what he is. He isn't human. I was thinking shapeshifter. It's gotten up to the part where he tells her what he is so I'm in a muck at the moment. Does anyone have any suggestions?      If you want a description of him here it is:   Her books went flying onto the floor. She looked up at the guy. He had messy brown hair. His skin was an unusual off white colour. Not quite tan. But most people in the school were like that, so she considered him to be a new guy. His eyes were a brown colour with a tinge of red. “I-I’m so sorry,” she said as she reached for a book. He reached for it at the same time. When their hands touched, she noticed that he had black veins and his skin was as a normal human temperature. His veins looked as if the blood had dried up in them. Taryn had an above human temperature, so she knew the difference, and assumed he was normal. “It’s okay; I shouldn’t have that map in my face all the time.” He had a concerned look on his face as if he noticed her temperature. She avoided everyone for this reason. She took another glance at him and jumped up. He flashed her a smile and she continued towards her locker without saying another word.       Please suggest something for him to be.

20090305014621AA0dN6i	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is hedonism a bad thing?	Everywhere, I hear people saying hedonism is a bad thing. Yet, I simply can NOT see any other point to life. To me, everything people do is self-motivated. If you help another, it's to make yourself feel better, perhaps to absolve yourself of past failures. But personally, and maybe this isn't such an optimistic outlook, I really believe everything we do is selfish. Thus, everything we do is for our own benefit, our own pleasure.      So is hedonism a bad thing? To me, life is about being as happy as you possibly can before you die. I don't think anybody has the right to interfere with the happiness of others, but I truly can't see any other reason to live other than to seek pleasure wherever you go.       Am I off here? Without getting into anything religious (that's a whole other debate), do you have feelings similiar to mine? And if not, please tell me. I want to know if my thinking is truly off-base here.

Here's just the general plot.                                                Undead Love   When your boyfriend dies in a car-crash you live through, a lot starts to occur. Especially when he didn’t actually die, his parents decided living on machines is like not living at all. So they turned off the life support and killed their only son.      But once he gets through the golden gates god realizes his made a mistake, and Colin decides he wants another chance but there’s a catch. Not even god can give someone’s life back; they have to make a sacrifice.   Colin takes it as a joke, and is reborn as a creature.      But Colin doesn’t realize that he isn’t actually human until, he makes contact with his girlfriend, Sarah.   Sarah doesn’t take it well, she thinks it’s a sick joke, and that’s when Colin realizes no one knows his alive.   Colin starts to hide in the shadows, but is never to far away from Sarah.      Sarah soon starts to believe that sick joke wasn’t really a joke. She sees his face nearly everywhere, and soon is demanding they did up his grave to prove her wrong and clam her never once and for all.   But everyone thinks she’s going crazy, so she runs to the graveyard, to dig up his grave. When she finally reaches the covin and opens it, she finds its empty.      She runs to tell her friends, but little did she know, Colin was feeling like an outcast and decided to go back to the cemetery where he felt he belonged. He finds his covin and lays with-in it. A few hours’ later friends and family are once again standing around Colin’s casket. Sarah opens the lid to see Colin lying down inside. She screams in disbelief and her parents grab her shoulders, you’ve caused enough trouble, but as they start to drag her to the car. The lid opens and Colin stands up and shouts, “She’s right, I’m not dead”.   Colin explains what happened.   BUT NOTHING GOES BACK TO NORMAL.   The adventure still continues to this day, we never no what crazy, sachem Colin will plan next.

Ever since reading it in Junior year, I've become obsessed with its characters, storyline, and theme and message. Specifically, my favorite character is Clarisse McClellan (I've practically fallen in love with that character lol) who was unaccepted by society because she has the odd habit of taking hikes, playing with flowers, and asking questions which is absolutely hilarious because whats weird to this society isn't far from what's weird in our society (why'd she have to die? T_T ). I came to realize that the world in which Montag lives in isn't too far off from our society and I couldn't help but wonder whether or not Bradbury knew the future. That is until my English teacher told me that a good artist writes about the present and from it, predicts the future. What do you guys think of the book?

I know it needs improvement but i was just wondering what you think :) and if you would want to read it if you picked the book up off a bookshelf. thank you! oh and also i cant think of a name for it, if you have any suggestions please feel free to tell me :)      Elizabeth Brooks has always done the smart thing, the sensible thing, she has always taken care of her younger sister Grace with no questions asked because, well, that's what sisters do. But when her mother remarries and goes away for a while with her new leathery husband, El is forced to be stronger than she feel inside, and she and Grace move to the east coast with their distant relatives, having no idea what awaits them.    But when a mysterious scary boy and his gang start to follow her, she knows something is wrong. Her cousin Eric is getting married, and used to be close with Lucas and the gang, until he fell in love and realised the life of petty crime wasn't all it was cracked up to be. But now El and her new crazy colourful friends are getting caught up in the war zone, and it looks like El is in the firing line. Respect is a powerful thing, so no body messes with Lucas' gang. Until El sums up the courage to fight back.

Is this the true nature of the universe?       Is death permanent?  Is it a transition into nothingness or into an alternate existence that is unfathomable in corporeal form.  Not a surviving soul per se, but perhaps a return to the elemental forms of which we were created.  For instance, you can look at dust blowing in the wind and think it is nothing to you... but can you imagine being that dust blowing around?      I am confused.  Death is scary.  The thought of non-existence is scary.

Hi there      There's a poem by quite a famous poet, but the name of the author and the title of the poem have escaped me.

In the end, he decides "not tonight" or something and keeps on travelling.      I remember it possibly being an analogy for the author's suicidal thoughts.

20090305023552AALnFgN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is the tone in John Donne's Meditation 17?	Nunc Lento Sonitu Dicunt, Morieris (Now this bell, tolling softly for another, says to me, Thou must die.)         Perchance, he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she does belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that action concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member. And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again for that library where every book shall lie open to one another. As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness.      There was a contention as far as a suit (in which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring first that rose earliest. If we understand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.      The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world?      No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.      Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbours. Truly it were an excusable covetousness if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction. If a man carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he travels. Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our home, heaven, by it. Another man may be sick too, and sick to death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this consideration of another's danger I take mine own into contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my God, who is our only security.

It's 5 o clock in the morning and I turn to yahoo answers to help me out.      1.) What exactly is the layout of the book?

20090305030725AAlFibY	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	How do I get ready for my photo shoot this weekend?	For the first time ever, I'm having professional portraits taken.  I told the photographer about what kind of outfits I'm going to wear, and what sort of look I want for each shot.  But are there any other things I should do personally to make sure I'm 'camera-ready'?  I'm definitely not a model.  I just want to make sure I look my best, since I'm paying good money to have them done.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.

20090305030834AAAP5Jg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poetry Analysis of Heat, by Hilda Doolittle (H. D.)?	O wind, rend open the heat,   cut apart the heat,   rend it to tatters.      Fruit cannot drop   through this thick air—   fruit cannot fall into heat   that presses up and blunts   the points of pears   and rounds the grapes.      Cut the heat—   plough through it,   turning it on either side   of your path.         I need to know the theme of the poem and the rhyme scheme and meter and the type of poem. PLEASE!

20090305035134AAcbFgh	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you give me your insights about the poem "somewhere I've never travelled"?	Our teacher said that the poem somewhere I've never travelled is a love poem but the question she threw to us is if the love that the persona has given to the one he/she loves is reciprocated? Please explain your answers and sight the lines to prove your claims...So here's the poem of e.e cummings   somewhere i have never travelled      somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond   any experience, your eyes have their silence:   in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,   or which i cannot touch because they are too near      your slightest look easily will unclose me   though i have closed myself as fingers,   you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens   (touching skilfully, mysteriously) her first rose      or if your wish be to close me, i and   my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,   as when the heart of this flower imagines   the snow carefully everywhere descending;      nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals   the power of your intense fragility: whose texture   compels me with the colour of its countries,   rendering death and forever with each breathing      (i do not know what it is about you that closes   and opens; only something in me understands   the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)   nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands

The scale was a list of emotions ie: anger, fear, humor, etc.  The idea is to examine your subject from the various emotions to gain multiple perspectives.   Does anyone have any idea what I am talking about (I know this is very vague).  Do you know the name of this scale (I think it was a Psycologist's name).  Does anyone know the complete scale?
