I would suggest running a stripped down version of Windows XP, which will run very well with 512MB of RAM and an 8GB HDD.

Cables can only be so long before they lose signal strength or quality.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to set up a home network, either wired Ethernet or wireless WiFi.<br>  <br>  Have a central computer act as your server with a shared directory or partition store data you want on the network, and have computers in each room map a network drive to that shared directory or partition on the server.<br>  <br>  If you have an old computer you aren't using anymore, you can always use that as your home server.  Put a copy of Windows XP Professional on it, and you can connect up to 9 computers to it on a home network using Workgroup peer-to-peer networking.|`|WfPs6HTBaa	With extension cables, or wireless mouse, keyboard, and somehow monitor (If they even sell those).<br>  Your best bet is to use remote assistance software on your data containing PC and use another PC, be it older or a laptop, in the other room to connect to the main PC and use it as if you were on it.<br>  Or you could just copy the data onto some form of removable media and then to another PC.<br>  The only way to do it without another PC would be a long cable for your monitor.

I just don't get why they haven't invented something better.<br>  <br>  In any case, the problem you are experiencing is that the wiring inside your Macbook charger is damaged; therefore, it will only work in certain "positions" that completes the wiring and appears to be randomly working.<br>  <br>  The only way you can solve the problem is to buy a new charger, I am afraid. However, I would recommend that you buy it from Topmic.com because they offer life time warranty and free shipping to all laptop chargers for about $30 cheaper than Apple.<br>  <a href="http://www.topmic.com/macbook-laptop-ac-adapter-power-supply-charger-and-power-cord.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmic.com/macbook-laptop-ac-...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|AA11336384	Ah, that happened to me with my iBook G4.

Is your DSL modem a router too? Because if its just a modem you need to connect it to the router with a ethernet cable. Look on the back of the modem and see if it has a ethernet plug. If so put the ethernet cable in there then the other end in the router in the WAN port ( it will be a single ethernet plug by itself ) Then there will be probably 4 ports together (LAN ports ). Put another ethernet cable in one of those and the other end of that in the computer. You are going to use the wireless on the game console right? You can configure it wirelessly like you wre going to do. You can check to see if you have internet on the computer, that will tell you if the router and modem are set up correctly.|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	Wait: if you didn't have anything pluged into your modem before and it was working, you have a wireless modem - it's a WiFi router and a modem in one. That's probably why it said "use both" when you tried to install the Linksys - you already had one built into your modem!<br>  <br>  If you aren't sure, call your broadband provider and ask them. If it's already wireless, you only need to get your Wii to find the network and connect.|`|GYil3uvWaa	Im not sure but i think if you have a locol computer/gamer shop you can find out. you could also check at a place called computers and more if you have one close by. i kno i have one in my state so yea. sorry if i didnt help much.

eK2xCiFbaa	First and foremost, don't worry about having to build the thing yourself.  Virtually every website that lets you customise a pc will physically put it all together for you before sending it.  Second, I would personally recommend a HDTV since it has built in speakers and the HDMI cable saves you from having to work out a seperate solution for sound since it carries this along with video.  That then brings me to the graphics card.  In my opinion, the graphics card will be the biggest indicator of visual performance.  A graphics card with a HMDI port on it will open up the computer to a HDTV, so consider that the first box to check.  The downside is how much you are prepared to spend since the cost of a graphics card alone can range into the thousands.  Best way to come to happy medium is to google for game specifications which you plan on playing as they will list recommended graphics specifications.<br>  <br>  The reason I point out graphics as the most important thing to look for is because processor requirements are generally a thing of the past, as is size of RAM, especially in gaming pcs, where the processor is normally around the 2 to 3 GHz and at least dual core and RAM is normally around the 4G size.  Other things like hard drive space dont concern me personally since i can get by on an 80 gig HD easily.  Reason being that file storage is always best left to external drives imho since I have more than 1 computer.<br>  <br>  The former points are, in my opinion, the most important.  Lesser points to note include getting a wired keyboard and a good quality wired ball mouse, since they are in every way, more responsive.  Responsiveness is the most important aspect of a gaming pc and wireless mice and keyboard have never given me the same response times in games.  Not to mention I have died online a few times when the batteries ran out :(  Also, a design point on the computer itself: Try to get one that has ports on the front for headphones, mic, and USB since you will almost inevitably need a headset for online play and if you plan on playing sports games, I've found it impossible to do so with a mouse and keyboard and a usb gamepad can always come in handy...  <br>  <br>  Phew that was nearly an essay... hope at least some of that helped<br>  :)|`|lcchJUuCaa	Yes both of those sites are great. and yes they already come built for you.<br>  <br>  and you can run your pc through your 360(like using windows media player) i do the same so i can watch movies and listen to all of the music that is on my computer. and i would just get an HDTV and if you do make sure you get an LCD and not a plasma because plasma's have burn in and LCD don't. so you could leave it running for days and months and nothing would happen if you did that with a plasma it would ruin it.<br>  <br>  <br>  and to have a computer that can run ALL your going to need to have around 3 to 4 thousand dollars. but you can get a pretty kickass gaming pc for around a 1k that will run most games damn good.<br>  <br>  look for any pc's with the AMD Phenom?II X4 920 Processor<br>  or the Intel Intel? Core? i7-920 2.66GHz. they are both awesome processors <br>  <br>  <br>  if you need any more help or have any more questions then feel free to send me a message or something. ill be glad to help|`|1blNhwEbaa	Basically, when you customize your own Gaming PC, you'll want to make sure that you have the following:<br>  <br>  RAM-<br>   It's the stuff your PC needs to run games! Large games use a lot of memory, so you'll want a few GB of it. 1GB will normally work, but if you want a powerhouse, and you're running Vista, go for 2GB or more.<br>  <br>  Processor-<br>  Make sure that it's fast! For a gaming PC, you probably shouldn't settle for less than a few GHz, although you can make it work with 1GHz...<br>  <br>  Hard Drive-<br>  You'll probably want a large one if you're going to be playing a lot of games! Most 3D games nowadays take up a few GBs of hard drive space, so be sure you consider how much room you'll need.<br>  <br>  Video/Graphics Card-<br>  Without a good video card it's extremely hard to play 3D games... Make that impossible. Luckily, most new video cards will work just fine.<br>  <br>  And then there are other things to consider...<br>  <br>  Speakers-<br>  Games are no good without a killer sound system to enhance the atmosphere! Just try playing a game without sound. It'll drive you to the brink of insanity!<br>  <br>  Peripherals and Controllers-<br>  To really get into the game, consider some PC USB gamepads, or a trackball, which can be way more fun than a mouse, although it costs more and can, at some times, be inconvenient. You may also want a gaming keyboard.<br>  <br>  As for the monitor...<br>  <br>  I suggest using a large LCD monitor or, as you mentioned, your HDTV. Those will normally come with cables that you can plug right into your PC's video card. With most HDTVs, you can press the input buttons on your remote control to switch between your PC, TV, and gaming systems.

The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material.

cGSY2wfaaa	I actually just went through something similar with my now ex. One thought is that maybe she's not even doing anything wrong? I know when my ex would hide things, the password would always change so I couldn't get into it. If you still think she is, I would say try logging on at times when she's unable to like before she comes home from work, or if you know that she's out for the evening or something.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'm pretty sure there isn't a tracker out there like you're looking for. I wish there was, but there isn't. Hope I at least helped somewhat. And, don't listen to any assholes out there who give you retarded answers.|`|sYEf626Aaa	first off your not married she can do anyone she wants and you<br>  can`t do anything about it. same goes for you|`|2afVnStxaa	Are you really prepared for the consequences of your actions here? Because if she is it is really going to hurt plus she will have every right to be angry that you would read through her private emails and such, no matter what she is doing there. But if she is not then you will have to either carry the fact that you violated her trust in you by spying on her or you will have to tell her what you have done and say sorry and most likely it will end the relationship. My advice is that if you have reason to believe that she is seeing someone else, then leave now because no matter what you do here and now, this is NOT going to go away. What if you find nothing by spying, will this change the reasons you already have for believing she is seeing the ex? Bottom line, no matter what you find there are consequences and the relationship is at this point doomed due to trust issues and/or cheating issues. But if you feel that you are ready for what ever you find, you can contact me via email through Yahoo Answers off of my profile and i will try to help you to get what you want. But, I do not wish to post some of this on here as it would help people to learn how to cheat and not worry about what I am going to help you do.

Long answer yes.<br>  You could put a key logger on her computer, but not her accounts.<br>  By that I mean, you COULD, had anyone developed one. But I can't see it happening.

I was one of the top 3 power sellers in my category. First step sign up at the link above, (and YES I do make a commission when you sign up, but when you do, I will give you all my tips and tricks,  they have three different levels of service. You can just buy the drop shipping package if you want, this means that you never have to handle merchandise. When someone pays you for an auction, you simply go to your site and order the product and it is shipped directly to your customer. If you can afford it, try to sign up for option 3 (complete package). This will give you a website for your products, as well as generate ads for eBay, and it generates data feeds for Comparison Shopping sites like Froogle, Google Base, Shopping.com, etc.,. This will help you earn revenue in other places than just eBay. Also, I will lead you to a source that will make everything you sell on eBay run on auto-pilot.<br>  If you are interested, sign up for the service and then email me at support@home-biz-group.com .

eK2xCiFbaa	If you're contemplating getting a new computer, get an external hard drive instead and backup any files you need.  Look into wiping the hard drive and restoring it to factory settings, because the sad fact is that if anti virus software doesn't help, its unrealistic to determine a solution since there could be one of a million things needed to be done to fix the issue.  Unless you know someone computer minded who would be able to diagnose and repair the computer your choices really are limited to wiping the hard drive or living with the computer as it is.  Buying a new computer or taking your computer to shop to be professionally fixed will both be extremely pricey so my advice is buy a hard and backup what you need to keep.|`|KNpkY3Pvaa	get rid of a lot of stuff that did not help, then down load glary utilitys for free, this will take care of most of your problems.|`|PqtQO7xWaa	I get pc help from <a href="http://www.pchelpdoc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pchelpdoc.com</a><br>  Just follow some of the links you'll <br>  Definately get some help there!<br>  Goodluck!

It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone.<br>  <br>  Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.<br>  <br>  If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface

3GmG8uQzaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|FNzUrpayaa	Reinstall the network/LAN driver for your model computer from HP.com|`|ov19Ixtgaa	Have you tried using system restore?

tIDNEwdMaa	Yes.  I is a good laptop.<br>  <br>  These a are few of my favorite Mac myths:<br>  <br>  1) Macs are more expensive than PC's<br>  a) Macs have a USEFUL life about twice that of PC's. A Mac user will be replacing his computer half as often as a PC user. Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>  b) It my PC using days, I would plan on buying hardware after bringing home a new computer. Not today when I get a Mac. This too, is part of the cost of using a PC.<br>  <br>  2) Everyone uses Windows.<br>  a) If Everyone uses Windows, why are we having this conversation?<br>  b) Hula Hoops, pet rocks, Tomakachi, etc were all popular at one time. "Popular" is no computer standard.<br>  <br>  3) Windows is better for gaming than Macs.<br>  a) True, but a game console is better at games than Windows.<br>  <br>  4) Not enough software/hardware for the Mac.<br>  a) With the exception of games (read #3), there is no class of software available for Windows not available for the Mac.<br>  b) Volume? There is a large selection for Windows than for the Mac, but walk down the aisle and see how much is crap and/or outdated (and discounted) software.<br>  c) Hardware selection for the Mac is lesser in number, but not as it is for software. Most companies are willing to take the time and expense of coding Mac drivers. Based on my experience, it is the crap hardware that usually does not have Mac drivers. This is because the manufacturer knows Mac users don't buy crap hardware.<br>  <br>  6) Macs are gay!<br>  a) Is this supposed to be an intelligent argument?<br>  <br>  7) Software written for Windows will not run on a Mac.<br>  a) Software written the Mac will no run in Windows.  What's the point here?<br>  <br>  8) Windows 7 will be better than Vista.<br>  a) Remember Windows ME? Windows 7 is likely to be better than Vista. This is not the same as "better than Mac OS".<br>  <br>  9) Macs are for multimedia.<br>  a) And web browsing, video/photo/audio editing, word processing, blogging, email, home work, writing, research, and ... you get the picture.<br>  <br>  10) Macs are for idiots.<br>  a) Tom Hanks, Stephen Speilberg, Buss Aldin, Martha Stewart, the late Boris Yelsin, Malcom Forbes Jr, Richard Dawkins, Tom Clancy, Scott Adams, Trent Reznor, The Rolling Stones, Bono, Conan O'Brien, Jerry Seinfeld, Rush Limbaugh, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Tim Allen, must all be idiots.<br>  <br>  11) You can't upgrade a Mac.<br>  a) You can upgrade a Mac. Thing is, why would you? The Mac come fully loaded.<br>  <br>  12) Macs are not "compatible.<br>  a) Windows cannot read a Mac formatted disc or access a Macintosh network. Which is more compatible?<br>  <br>  13) Macs and PC's both use Intel processors so they are essentially the same.<br>  a) If you use internal components as a standard, then a Yugo and a BMW are essentially the same.<br>  <br>  14) Macs don't have a right-click mouse.<br>  a) This is old, wrong, and irrelevant.|`|MIR3eC5kaa	MAC sucks i love hp, hp is the highest rated laptops|`|qitj8Nqraa	yes. but for you? i don't know. everybody needs something specific for themselves.

Those who tell you the Mac is more expensive are short sighted.<br>  <br>    A Mac will have a USEFUL life about twice that of a PC.  Replacement is half as often.<br>  <br>    It's a shame that I have to make the word "useful" is caps.  Some people have trouble understanding the difference between how long a computer is functional and how long a computer is useful.  I have a mac that is almost 20 years old.  It is still functional.  It is long past useful.  A PC will likely remain functional about as long a a Mac.  Maybe longer.  Who knows?  Who cares?|`|KTz3qpCvaa	Whichever you are willing to pay for.

It's illegal to alter the OS to make it run on a PC.<br>  <br>  You're essentially asking to run an inexpensive OS ($129) on cheap hardware instead of running the costly OS (Windows - up to $400 for Vista, plus security costs) on cheap hardware. You can't have it both ways. Either you pay a little more for the hardware and get a great OS, or you pay less for the hardware and get a crappy OS.

f550d7da3b1b2b34378639f2de0153d7aa	En primer lugar, es muy posible que tu amigo te esté mintiendo para confundirte.<br>  <br>  Si bien es cierto que existen algoritmos y otros métodos (que caen en la categoría de "ataque por fuerza bruta") que le permitirían atacar un servidor de correos, la mayoría de esos ataques ya no funcionan, porque los sistemas de seguridad actuales detectan fácilmente ataques de fuerza bruta (ya pasaron de moda, por decirlo así).<br>  <br>  Existen otras maneras más sencillas de acceder a tu correo. Te puedo citar algunos ejemplos:<br>  <br>  * Si olvidas cerrar tu sesión cuando revisaste tu correo en un PC, tu amigo puede acceder a tu correo en ese PC, si la ventana del navegador no fué cerrada. Lo mismo puede pasar con el messenger.<br>  <br>  * Existen programas llamados "keyloggers", que pueden grabar todo lo que escribes en tu PC, incluida tu contrase?a. Estos programas caben en un diskette y se pueden instalar en cuestión de segundos, al menor descuido.<br>  <br>  *Tu amigo puede instalar un virus troyano en tu PC, es igual de sencillo, e incluso puede hacer que tú lo instales disfrazándolo como otra cosa, un juego o algo así. El troyano le permitiría a tu amigo monitorear tu PC cada vez que te conectas a internet.<br>  <br>  * Existen ciertas páginas web que te piden tu nombre de usuario y contrase?a, que en realidad suelen ser enga?os para obtener estos datos. Tu amigo podría incluso crear su propia web enga?osa y dirigirte hacia ella.<br>  <br>  * Finalmente, está la posibilidad de que haya adivinado tu pregunta secreta, y para esto puede valerse de lo que conoce sobre tí, y la información que tu hayas dejado por en internet, en foros, blogs, hasta en yahoo respuestas. Yo lo hice una vez, y solo tuve que meterme al perfil de esa persona para informarme ;)<br>  <br>  Existen más maneras que en este momento no se me vienen a la cabeza. Lo que si te puedo decir, es que si tu amigo fuera del tipo que ataca servidores de email, sería un hacker, y un verdadero hacker:<br>  1) Nunca revela su identidad a la víctima<br>  2) Nunca habla de los métodos que usa<br>  3) No sería tan estúpido como para usar un ataque de fuerza bruta sabiendo lo facil que sería detectarlo.<br>  <br>  Piensalo un poco... Probablemente le diste una buena oportunidad para averiguar tu contrase?a.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|31e2806e21e38e1577a84a386c4f3152aa	a lo mejor te encontro tu contrese?a e algun lugar donde lo apuntaste|`|47d995225b53949af6af549ac052b479aa	Debe haber respondido a tu pregunta secreta.<br>  Consejo, entra, cambiala y no contestes algo obvio, si la pregunta es :nombre de tu mascota, no pongas el nombre de tu mascota, sino otra respuesta, no relacionada a la pregunta ;)|`|755aa274fc4372a29642a3754104386eaa	Mira si tu pass es dificil entonces pidio a hackers que le proporcinen la conta?ase?a, esos creo que cuestan $790 POR CUENTA.<br>  <br>  Pero tambien para verificar, ellos te mandan 1 pantalla capturada.|`|bzz9TPakaa	te mordio.  uso algun programa basado en diccionarios y seguro tu clave debe ser algo como "mama me quiere" o "sofia te amo"  y te agarro.  o, quiza te este enga?ando y te puso un "keylogger" en su pc o la tuya y te agarro la data.<br>  <br>  si ese es el caso aunque la cambies mil veces siempre la tendra.|`|e8WeZA5Aaa	Sencillamente sabe tu contrase?a y debes cambiarla.|`|eW22XGWzaa	si el tiene pc con internet y tu alguna vez abriste tu correo en su casa es posible ya que hay keylogger que detectan todo lo que escribes en el teclado...ten mucho cuidado cambia tu clave y abre tu correo en sitios seguros...si quieres mas info buscate el google keylogger y veras todo...chao y suerte|`|gKxkJu9taa	sabe tu contrase?a obiamente|`|c960962b1ac78858ec7a4d6d37a7bbf4aa	debió averiguar tu contrase?a de algún modo.|`|a93f5f2a8e0f81ec61ac0912a2c7fb4eaa	Sorry, veo tus intenciones, no las podes ocultar, pretendes abrir el correo de otra persona....que feo???<br>  Te equivocaste de foro amigo??|`|2ea42d1eb5992ebc9916fa6eaa270ca7aa	hace una cosa cambia la contrase?a a una mas difícil y no la vayas a notar en ningún lado ,solo memorisala bien,suerte .|`|Bz8zefbHaa	seguro vio tu password en algun lado o alguien se lo dijo o te mandaron un programa para capturar lo que tecleas o tu password es muy facil, algo asi como <br>  123<br>  perro<br>  tu fecha de cumple o alguna tonteria asi.<br>  si puedes cambialo, usa algo mas elaborado y no lo apuntes en ningun lado ni se lo des a nadie y revisa tui compu x las dudas.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Cambia de contrase?a y ya.

08f2d5258d91068ac14010a36ddfb877aa	If you have a virus, use Avast to find it and kill it.  You can get it at www.avast.com.  It's free to use on personal computers but you have to buy the professional version if you are going to use it for your business.  I have it on ALL of my business computers and it's FAR better than Norton or any of the other "big boys".  I've never had a bug that Avast didn't find and kill.<br>  <br>  If your computer is a notebook, you could have a cooling problem.  I've seen that happen where it will hard lock simply because of an overheated processor.  Try improving the airflow under the case.<br>  <br>  Also, you want to shut down systems one at a time until you find the one that is giving you the problems like the guy described before.<br>  <br>  If the Avast, ventillation, and program isolation solutions don't fix your problem and you have a system restore disk then use it.  It sucks, but sometimes you have to start over.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to buy a new system, go to www.stupidcheapcomputers.net.  I buy all of my stuff from them.  I can buy a complete, new system from them with a warranty for LESS than it would cost me to build it myself or order a custom one from the makers.  They gave me the code ATX926 to get a 10% discount at checkout.  Try it to see if it works for you.  I don’t know HOW they are so cheap, but they are.  Plus, I have NEVER had any problems with anything that they have sold me.  Those guys blow my mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	I can tell it's not a Mac.

You would need to call the company that made the computer and tell them the model of the computer on the phone and they will send you a new "restore cd". I think they will charge you around $70.00 for it. If you dont know how use the restore cd, then take it into best buy and have them do it for around $50.00. Also you can try Installing Windows XP pro or home into your computer. To do this you need to either buy, or barrow a windows xp cd from someone and install it into your pc. I Advise you to call a local computer store and tell them your situation. Im pretty sure they will tell you the same thing I said but they will also tell you a 3rd and forth option which is, buy a new computer, or buy a virus/spyware kit which i advise you not to do.|`|ffaa1e5c1f597d065295c9ea58fa7738aa	what do you need help in
JNDeSHSQaa	It all depends on your macbookpro's motherboard. Some motherboards can only accept processors up to core duo and cant accept core 2 duo. Try to find out either from Apple or look in your computers manual and try to find if it'll accept core2duo's. What you'll want to look for is what type of "socket" the motherboard has. Certain processors fit into certain sockets,so its important to know when choosing your processor.  And taking it into a Best Buy and having them install your processor would be a good idea. If u hadn't chosen a processor by the time you take your computer into there you could always have them take a look at what socket your motherboard has, find a core2duo processor there in the store that fits the socket,and have them install it and voila!|`|31bc596c7a64fdd09afe9b28029d9ea8aa	Send it to a electronics or computers shop and pick the best core 2 duo which fits ure needs, and ask them to install it for you.

Even if you can, I doubt you'd notice a significant improvement in performance. Apple only claimed a 39% increase over the Core Duo models, and they had the advantage of updating the entire system, not just the processor.

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi Marcus... Here's some instructions on how to make it work (note: you will also need Eudora + free edition installed on the PC):<br>  <br>  Starting in Mac Mail do the following for each mailbox you wish to transfer (In, Sent, Deleted, etc.):<br>  <br>  Select all messages and choose File -> Save As from the main menu. Choose "Raw Message Source" as the format and a name for the group of messages and click the "Save" button. Even though there are no obvious "export" commands from Mac Mail, this will effectively create a file in standard mbox format. However, Outlook Express will not directly import this file type so we'll have to play with it a bit.<br>  <br>  Transfer the file you just created to the PC.<br>  <br>  Open the directory C:\Documents and Settings\[Account Name]\Application Data\Qualcomm\Eudora (you will need to go to the View tab under the Tools -> Folder Options menu and select "Show Hidden Files and Folders" to be able to view this folder).<br>  If appropriate, rename the file you created in step 1 to match one of the mailboxes in this folder (In, Out, Junk, Trash, etc). Assign this file a .mbx extension.<br>  <br>  Copy the file from the previous step into the folder you opened in step 3. (Important! Only do this if you don't mind overwriting the email in your Eudora application).<br>  <br>  Open Eudora and view the mailbox you just copied. This will firmly establish your .mbx file as a Eurdora mailbox. Don't worry if the text in your messages doesn't look quite right - this will soon be remedied.<br>  <br>  Open Outlook Express. Select File -> Import -> Messages from the main menu. Choose "Eudora Pro or Light" and go through the rest of the wizard. This should properly import all your messages from the selected mailbox into Outlook Express.|`|a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	Why go backwards?

The [h] indicates total hours of time, else you are using hours on the clock, where 1:00 = 25:00 = 49:00....<br>  <br>  Remember that hours are stored as 24ths of a day in Excel.  So be careful that you are adding hours to hours.  15:00 + 3:00 = 18:00, but 15:00 + 3 gets added as three days = 15:00 + 36:00 = 51:00, which is bad.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	You're using the time format, and there is no such thing as 25:00 in the time format.

At my office they took 13 regular computer servers and virtualized them into one brand new dell server. The reason they do this is because:<br>  1 its easier to backup, and you can create a live clone of it so if one drops the other one is right there waiting.<br>  2 it produces 1nth of the heat.

That is changing though, because digital is cheaper and more capable, Digital switching often suffers quality problems right now, but as it matures you will see less and less analog switching.

The Macbook has a Core 2 Duo processor that has two cores, or two processors that are each a little faster than a G5. Combine that with a higher clock speed than the G4 in your Powerbook, and you've got a much faster system.

6c7eceb36677944f26b06525fd95f7ccaa	I joined one and did TONS of surveys to get paid.  They said they would pay anywhere from 2 dollars to 250 dollars a survey.  I treated it like a real job.  When the kids left for school, I got busy doing surveys.  Most of the day too.  What they don't tell you is, that you have to complete 2 to 5 surveys per payment.  Well, when you sign up for them, they give your name away to others, and before you know it, you have about 300 surveys a day coming in to do.  There is no way to keep track of each one to make sure you do the amount they want.  And, you have to qualify to do a survey.  Some of them won't even let you take the survey.  It got totally overwhelming.  And.....I never recieved a penny from anyone for any surveys I did do.  And I had to pay to do this.  I got lots of spam from that too.  Some of them sounded so great.  But, before I did anything, I checked the name out on the internet.  If you do that, that will usually lead you to a site where you can see for yourself that they are not a legitimate company.

8e16a9af575834dcd917a9dbcf55b1dfaa	Hello Dudette,<br>  <br>  Get this, and you are a billionare. :)<br>  <br>  Seriously, there are things out there called proxy filters, where you can point your computer to, and get "filters".<br>  <br>  Many of these filters are "pay for" services so they are not free.  <a href="http://www.family.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.family.net</a>  <br>  <br>  There are also programs that you can install on your computer that will filter web sites.  NetNanny, Cyberpatrol, SurfControl, and about a billion other ones.<br>  <br>  There is a big difference between these two.  The first one is held off-site, and maintained by a 3rd party.  If you have your computer set-up correctly, everything you surf will go through this filter, without exception.  However, this could be a bad thing.  Some things that you may want unblocked may be blocked.  For example "Chicken Breast"  Because "Breast" is a part of your search, you might not get to it.<br>  Proxy's are usually the better way to go, especially if there is an over-ride feature.<br>  <br>  The latter is a bit more complicated.  You have to download a piece of software to your computer, and update it ALL the time.  Porn and other people are constantly moving around the web, trying not to get caught.  You have to keep these systems up-to-date.  <br>  <br>  What this means also is that you have another piece of software running on your computer taking up resources.  Plus, since it is running locally, anyone (virtually) can bypass it at any time.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider, NO FILTER IS 100%.  At best I would guess that filters are about 60% to 80% effective.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Tom|`|XUvGKq7Haa	use NetDog Filter : <a href="http://www.netdogsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdogsoft.com</a>|`|92ffc2493a78dd706eaa6aaa8e617146aa	i dont know if u can actually block one picutr, but u can block  that whole site. go to the control panel, internet options, and then u will get a place to type the offending site's address, no matter what browser u are using

ZvkUBNOtaa	That is a VERY bad practice, here's why.<br>  <br>  When your computer is running, it's moving data all over the place constantly, from the hard drive platters to the hard drive cache, to RAM, through the CPU, back to the cache on the hard drive and then written to the drive platters.  When you shut down your computer properly it clears all that data and writes it all back to the hard drive, then powers off.<br>  <br>  MANY, MANY times I have seen people do what you're doing and they don't notice a problem for a while.  It can be a little while or a long while but the damage is cumulative and eventually you are going to have serious data corruption because you did not allow the computer to function the way it was designed to.  <br>  <br>  The least that will happen is you'll eventually lose data and cause Operating System malfunctions, the worst is that you'll crash the heads on the hard drive and lose the drive completely.  By 'crash the heads"  I don't mean it will be corrupted and need a clean install, I mean it will become a door stop.<br>  <br>  In between those two extremes are all kinds of malfunctions, data errors, and gremlins that will creep into the system as you persist in powering off without shutdown.  There are so many other things that can cause data problems that adding to them on purpose is just asking for trouble, a LOT of trouble.  Unplugging and plugging back into the wall can also cause voltage spikes that can fry sensitive computer components.<br>  <br>  What you are doing is the equivalent of driving your car into a wall to shut it off, rather than parking it and turning off the key. Eventually the damage will accumulate and the car won't run anymore.  Stop doing that.  There's a very good reason why the shutdown controls are there, use them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Update:<br>  <br>  Yes, that can also fry the power supply.  The power supply is controlled (on an ATX system) by the motherboard, it's 'expecting' a shutdown command.  An ATX powersupply has chips in it that control it so hosing the power connection can most certainly be bad for it, just like the rest of the chips in the system.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything about snarfing down your dinner and vomiting out the window of your car though :)|`|C6jFigESaa	Hi, Edixor.<br>  <br>  When you're finished using your computer, it's important to turn it off appropriately—not only to save energy, but also to make sure that your data is saved and to help keep your computer more secure. Best of all, your computer will start quickly the next time you use it. <br>  <br>  Improper shut down of a  PC may result in an extended boot process. That's because improperly shutting down your computer forces Windows to check your system's hard drive for data errors.  <br>  <br>  Put it this way:  You looked at the clock and noticed you are late while you are sitting around the dinner table enjoying a nice dinner of baked chicken and rice. To make sure you arrive at job in time, you force the food down your throat without properly chewing it, then off you went to work. On your way, you noticed you become extremely nauseous and uncomfortable from eating too fast, and soon you would find yourself vomitting through the car window.<br>  <br>  The same applies to when shutting down windows in a hurry. You force your system to check Data errors, to properly save your work, etc, and this may result in hardware failure or software failure, like corrupting your software files. <br>  <br>  Also, you should notice your PC takes a long time to boot up after having been shutted down improperly, but your system boots faster when you properly shut it down. This is because all your works are saved, data's are checked, etc, safely and leisurely.<br>  <br>  I hope this clarifies a little for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  I am assuming you are referring to the power button on your computer, right?  If yes, then using your power button to turn off the PC suddenly should not cause harm to the power button in any way.   There are times when you may need to suddenly turn off your PC.  That's why the power button is there from the first place.  <br>  <br>  If you mean the power supply ( the adaptor), then yeah; unplugging and plugging maybe ruin it, just like what happened to my first Ipod device. <br>  <br>  I have a Dell laptop that is now serving me 6 years, and I often shut it down suddenly via the power button ( which is not recommended as previously mentioned above), and my power button has not burnt out.

For instance, if you're just printing a draft quality, it takes somewhat less ink than photo quality even for text.

If not, it could be a faulty USB port, and the only solution would be to use another one or replace that one. Since it works in your other computer, there's nothing wrong with your flash drive but with the computer.<br>  <br>  If you have another flash drive with something on it, you could test it on the computer your Sandisk doesn't work on, or an external hard drive or something with backed up media on it. If none of those work, something on your computer is corrupt and only a format would fix it.<br>  <br>  In order to format your computer, you need a Windows Vista operating system disk, which should have come with your computer. Make sure your computer can boot from the CD drive, put the disc in, and restart the computer after backing up all your important files. Then you will be given some options - you'll want the Format option. IIRC, there are two options under Format - full or quick. The full one overwrites everything on the drive with the new operating system, whereas the quick one leaves most of your files intact and only overwrites the operating system. For your needs, you could do either, but keep in mind that with either, there's a risk you'll lose some personal stuff. Choose what drive you want to format (if there's more than one) and your computer will do the rest, prompting you for different things when it needs to.
im6Gyuijaa	Go to my computer and right click on the drive you would like to format and click format.

In the process its power output would gradually deteriorate giving you less & less wattage.<br>  <br>  This is why the recommendation is always higher than what "may" in fact really be necessary. You never want to run a PSU at over 80% its capacity too often. <br>  The graphic card recomendations for PSUs take this into consideration......AND so should we.|`|RSyZFFx9aa	you should have no less than 400 watts because then under- wattage will lead to a brownout. i would recommend a 550 watt PSU, your PSU might not be delivering stable power or "clean power" so try a 550 watt PSU in the 50 - 60 dollar range they will deliver clean power|`|XlyLakYAaa	There is NO way 800 watts is too little.  At most you're pulling 600watts, and even that is a generous estimate.
044IeGstaa	1.The cost of a Psu does negate the reliability, or performance of it. The hardware parts used inside does.

It's about finding a website like Hardwaresecrets.com, that tears the Psu apart. Checks each part, and knows if it's junk, or quality from the info they have. Then put's the Psu back together, and runs it on an expensive analyzer, putting it through extreme testing.<br>  They don't take 'bribes' from the Psu manufacturer, or 'kick backs'.<br>  They tell it LIKE it is.<br>  1.<a href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/522" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/5...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/410" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/4...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/181" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/1...</a><br>  <br>  It may also be in your power supply line from your power company. Line conditioner? Like what? A voltage regulator with noise suppression, or transient impulse protection?<br>  <br>  If the power line transformer on the pole outside, that feeds to your house has the voltage jacked up, no wimpy 'line conditioner' is gonna' fix it. A -> Lot of times, the power utility company will jack the main voltage up, because they have a lot of users using electricity. Or, maybe new house construction is going on around you, and they jacked the juice up, to take care of the additional customers. <br>  <br>  They don't take into consideration, (Or don't care, or aren't intelligent enough), that your line transformer needs to be turned down.<br>  I have seen 164 volts AC, coming into some houses.

(or you are being ripped off for what is actually a cheap PSU).<br>  <br>  Overloading is obvously bad, but also under-running can cause problems eg. if you use a 500W supply on a machine that's only running 150W.<br>  <br>  Usually, only certain outputs are properly regulated and the others rely on the load being proportional over all the outputs. If it's run out of it's design range this does not work and you get problems.<br>  <br>  I've given up on generic supplies due to a large number of failures, I now only use Antec (the 80+ rated ones) and I've not had any problems with these so far.|`|NJBp6uJkaa	your room that you use it in my be to humid for it, try getting a dehumidifier<br>  <br>  the also all may be overheating, maybe try some more fans or different coolers to get the heat out of your case <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.aspx?Category=11&name=Fans-Heatsinks" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.asp...</a>|`|Bb33pr0Raa	It is probably under powered for the hardware you have, try a 100 watts or more, bigger next time.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Check the air flow of your fan

XW4pa8Pzaa	Just plug it in a USB port, and it will appear in your computer just like any CD or DVD. Now you can copy files to it and delete files just like you do on your hard drive. The only difference is that if you delete something from it it's gone for good, it doesn't go to the recycle bin, so you have to be careful with what you delete. Also when you're done, don't just unplug it. You have to click on the icon in the task bar that says "safely remove device" if you don't do that you could lose data or it becomes write protected and you can't do anything with it. Also, USB memory drives can give viruses just like anything else, so it's recommended that you plug it in in safe mode first, scan it for viruses, and then you can go in normal mode. Always do that after you have plugged it in another computer like in school or something.|`|bzlT9jdSaa	You usually use an USB memory drive to transfer files from your computer to another computer. It's an ideal way of storing and carrying documents/music and all sorts of file-related stuff. It's like a glorified floppy disk or cd-drive, but you can write to it numeral times.<br>  <br>  You usually just plug it in your computer, PC or Mac. And it will pop up in your file manager, then you just copy the files you want to it.

33cbKVR7aa	Yes, if a laptop is too cold, or too heated it will not work properly or not start up at all. Like a pen almost..<br>  <br>  It should be fine if the laptop is kept in normal house temperature. If you are traveling and it is cold/winter outside and the laptop gets cold, it might not even turn on, but it doesn't necessarily mean it crashed or is broken.|`|pyGQqMXbaa	This question feels kind of common sense, since if your computer gets to cold, your processor and motherboard will not be able to process. Theres a reason why theres fan in your computer, so just keep your computer semi-heated or else it could cause permanent damage.|`|kyL7UNeRaa	your laptop should be just fine as long as you keep it above freezing and on hot days just be sure to give it a break every hour or 2 and make sure the vents are clean and not obstructed
0V8vOMczaa	First you have to make an account to buy and sell stuff. Then you can but stuff up for auction, along with a description of it and such. people can e-mail you to ask questions. you can ship, but you can charge extra for that or you can just have them pick it up. You can also do a "buy now" thing, or a buy now or best offer thing. You also have to pick how your customers can pay. Ex. paypal, checks, cash, etc. You can open a store on e-bay or you can just make an account. For the store you have to make monthly payments to e-bay. To buy things, you just search them in the toolbar, and once you are signed in, and you have something that you like bid on it, but read the description, payment methods, shipping, and customer satisfaction which the sellers can earn. You can also watch an item. Good luck.|`|xtBdRAxPaa	You shop around and when you see something you like you bid on it. Make sure you are already registered with a username and I suggest you register for PayPal, as well.

Buyers who want that item will raise and place/set a higher bid and go up a few bucks. If you want this item, you have to place/set a higher bid than the starting amount he is offering. Whoever places/sets the highest bid by the ending time on the ending date gets the item. Always place/set your high bid at the very last minute or when there is like 30 seconds left so nobody will outbid you. If you are selling an item, place a starting bid. If you are buying an item, you can pay using PayPal Method.

But you can't delete those - Windows won't delete open files.  As soon as you close that document, the temp file is supposed to be deleted.  If it's not, you can delete it if you want.  So either delete them all (delete, not send to recycle bin) or go to the drive's properties and use the disk cleaner to get rid of all the ones that will delete (it's easier).|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Nope, they are not needed...|`|D4jdJl7Oaa	no. you can delete them anytime you want. there are a few temporary files that will not delete because they are being used by another program, but most of them will delete.|`|Yn7JMTKxaa	yes you can get rid of the them.no you don't need them.safe surfing|`|AA11487114	there is no harm doing this.

MS-DOS prompt is more so the program to worry about as it can permanently delete everything on your hard drive. <br>  Command Prompt is more a tool for those who like using old school methods of finding things on their PC.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	You can open a txt file in cmd, you do that with the command "edit" followed by it's path or only it's name if you're already in it's directory.

Went back to their "site" and saw this: Terms and Disclosures. By clicking the order button, I am ordering the Google Money System? and trial membership for $1.95 s&h, after the 7 day trial I will be charged $47 a month thereafter if I do not cancel.<br>  <br>  So I got charged for something I haven't used or even seen in the mail yet??? Now to see if I can cancel it or am off to the bank to place a stop on that debit order.

You'll find that Google/Yahoo/ many other large companies will register their name as a domain name in every country where it's available.<br>  <br>  If google.eu is owned by anyone else other than Google, I'd say that that won't be the case for long. Google would for sure have an International copyright on the name Google and will sue the pants off anyone who tries to sit on their domain name!

I have a 2.6ghz AMD dual core in mine... 5050e is the modle of the chip... <br>  Yes its a aspire 5515 from walmart....|`|v3ncANM5aa	I don't recommend overclocking. The particular chip this lappy has only uses 15 watts. I have this exact laptop and I've ordered a new chip for it. Acer (Emachines) says you can safely go up to a chip that uses 45 watts which is what I'm gonna do. If you know someone who can change the chip out and your willing to take the risk here's the link to the chip. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103263&Tpk=N82E16819103263." rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> I also changed the RAM to. The RAM in this lappy runs at 667. With the new RAM I'll get 800 FSB. The last thing I'm gonna do is change the HD. The stock HD for this lappy runs at 5400 RPM. A HD running at 7200 RPM will bump the speeds up even more. Of course making all of these changes will kill the battery at a much faster rate but sacrifices must be made! Changing any one of these will give you better performance.

It lets you run any windows program, and is only like 30 bucks. If you just want the office programs for school, you can get Microsoft Office for Macs. As far as games go, crossover should work fine.

T5MR7fNHaa	90' core temperature for a short time is unlikely to cause any permanent damage.<br>  <br>  High temperatures (below the point things start melting) tend to accelerate aging, that's how a lot of life expectancy tests are done.<br>  (eg. a few minutes could have aged it a day or two).<br>  <br>  Tip: Get the latest CPU driver & dual-core optimizer from www.amd.com and once these are installed set Windows power management to 'Minimal power management' - this will allow the AMD stuff to control the CPU speed & voltage, which keeps the heat down without any noticable effect on performance. <br>  <br>  Set a CPU warning temperature but not Fan failure - the power control works so well the fan on some systems can slow enough to trip the fail warning when the system is idle.|`|peFufWeYaa	Depends on how long it stayed that hot, but it is possible you shortened it's life a bit. Hopefully you did not damage it. Max allowed is 95 C. Nice processor, best take care of it|`|im6Gyuijaa	That would probably not do too much damage instantly, but you'll go a lot slower and, yes, eventually permanent damage will come. I generally only allow my CPU to go to around 130 degrees F (about 55 degrees C), but that's cause I'm paranoid with going as fast as possible. I use Intel, so AMD may be different in the respect of heating, but it's still probably wise to keep the temperature low.
ARiiccLTaa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors. As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  After you have manage to repair your computer and in the long run, it's advisable to install the Recovery 'Console on your computer to make it available in case you are unable to restart Windows. You can then select the Recovery Console option from the list of available operating systems on startup.To install the Recovery Console, you must have administrative rights on the computer.<br>  <br>  Although you can run the Recovery console by booting directly from the Windows XP CD, it's much more convenient to set it up as a startup option on your boot menu.<br>  <br>  To install the Recovery Console, perform the following steps:<br>  <br>  1. Insert the Windows XP CD into the CD-ROM drive.<br>  <br>  2. Click Start, and then click Run.<br>  <br>  3. In the Open box, type d:\i386\winnt32.exe /cmdcons where d is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive.<br>  <br>  4. A Windows Setup Dialog Box appears, which describes the Recovery Console option. The system prompts you to confirm installation. Click Yes to start the installation procedure.<br>  <br>  5. Restart the computer. The next time you start your computer, you will see a "Microsoft Windows Recovery Console" entry on the boot menu.<br>  <br>  By the way, the time that the boot menu is displayed defaults to 30 seconds but can be changed from the "my computer" properties<br>  <br>  Control Panel --> System --> Advanced tab --> Startup and Recovery.|`|CARmP1zLaa	Plan a) Try to do a restore thorugh the task manager.<br>  Plan b) Insert windows disc ask it to repair you windows.|`|XMZaVDjDaa	Simple.

You can do this via your router firmware which can be accessed by typing the IP address of the router into a web browser and hitting the <enter> key. From here, you can choose WEP/WPA security.<br>  <br>  For additional security, some routers (not all) allow you to manually compose a list of pre-approved LAN devices. You can either specify them by hostname or by static LAN IP address (you must set this up beforehand). This way, you can effectively restrict access to devices except for the ones that you add to this list personally.

The memory chip in your computer is for system processes and isn't meant for long term storage.<br>  <br>  As for your percentages listed, I can only think of one thing that would apply to.  Hard drive (HDD) space.  Which is where you went wrong in the first place.  You bought 1GB ram to increase your HDD space.  The two are not even remotely the same devices.  One may enhance the efficiency of the other, but they do not together to increase long time storage capacity.  <br>  <br>  You need to add a larger HDD or buy an external one to increase storage capacity.  Increasing memory only increases system efficiency.<br>  <br>  Also looking Dell, and your model number, I came across information on the specs this laptop requires.  You may of bought the wrong memory chip so its not registering.|`|3dv7Qdoxaa	Wow, you are all over the place... <br>  <br>  First, km has nothing to do with computers. That's a system of measurement (kilometers). You mean to say kb (kilobytes). And, you should be saying mb (megabytes), not kb (kilobytes). There are 1024 kbs in one mb. If your computer had 750 kbs of memory, it wouldn't be able to turn on. You actually had 750 mbs before, now you have 1240 mb (1.24 gb). <br>  <br>  Second, I don't know what you mean when you say 9.28% of your memory is taken when it was 750 kb. Usually, the computer doesn't say how much of your memory is taken up, since memory's a temporary cache for things like internet files and the like. <br>  <br>  The reason it went from 9.28% to 0%, if that's the case, is that the memory was 'cleared' when you restarted your computer. At least that's my best guess. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're not getting memory (RAM) and hard drive space confused. The hard drive is where the game will be installed on the computer. I already explained what memory is, but your game won't be installed on there. More memory will, however, make the game run faster.

vL2Ec50Yaa	You have very sticky keys?  <br>  <br>  I would advise replacing the keyboard.  You can do it yourself if you feel that you are capable. <br>  You need a small set of screwdrivers, the 'service' manual for your laptop that includes instructions for the removal of the keyboard.<br>  You also need a NEW replacement keyboard - I usually check on eBay for the exact model number of your laptop.  This is an easy replacement.  If you purchase the keyboard, you could probably take it into the small local computer repair shop and have them replace it for about $20 (The major cost is in the keyboard itself $20 - $45.)<br>  <br>  You may find a video on Youtube on how to replace the keyboard on your model of laptop... I have seen them there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Just change the word Administrator to the username of that account.<br>  <br>  <br>  (For Mac OS X)<br>  1) Boot from your Mac OS X Install CD/DVD.<br>  2) Choose your language.<br>  3) From the menu bar, click on Utilities.<br>  3) Click on the option entitled "Reset Password".<br>  4) Enter a new password and press OK.<br>  5) Restart from your normal Macintosh HD.<br>  6) Log in using your new password.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	If you do not set a password for the user administrator it leaves an open door to anyone who gets the slightest grip on the machine. And since everyone knows the name administrator is there it is a good target.
im6Gyuijaa	Google it, it's an extremely common question.|`|YHc5aWAYaa	It depends on if you are talking about an internal ip address, or an external ip address. If you have a router, then all of your computers share a single external ip address and each have an internal one. To get a new external ip address, you will need to restart (unplug, replug) your router and/or modem. <br>  <br>  Why do you need a new ip address? Did you do something on a website that requires you to wait time, eg vandalizing wikipedia or downloading illegal software from warez sites? If you are trying to sidestep some kind of time limitation, perhaps you should NOT do the things that are getting you time limited instead of trying to side-step the prevention.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	if you have windows, right click the network connection icon in the task bar.

It really depends on the CD drive model, and whether anything inside the drive got bent or snapped off when the tray got yoinked.<br>  <br>  You've definitely got the right idea in that you don't want to force it back in.  Many CD drives' trays can be safely reinserted if you remove the front cover.  Unfortunately this usually means you have to take the drive out of your PC first:<br>  <br>  1. Turn off your PC<br>  2. Unplug the power cord<br>  3. Ground yourself electrically<br>  4. Open up the PC's case<br>  5. Unplug the two (or three) wires from the back of the CD drive<br>  6. Using a non-magnetic Phillips-head screwdriver, remove the CD drive from the computer<br>  7. Remove the cover from the front of the drive<br>  8. Reinsert the tray... how exactly this step goes depends on the model|`|AA10535978	Aaaah that's tricky if its disconnected!!!  I think its broken.  Its better to get a new one.

2c67606b325557d85ec62793e663a7c0aa	Google est un néologisme créé à partir du mot ? googol ?. En 1938, le mathématicien américain Edward Kasner demande à son neveu, Milton Sirotta, d'inventer un nom pour désigner le nombre composé du chiffre 1 suivi de 100 zéros, et le gar?onnet de huit ans propose ? googol ? (bon, puisque vous insistez : 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 !

There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college... <br>  <br>  I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.<br>  <br>  FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory.<br>  <br>  Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/outlet</a><br>  <br>  Hope Above Info Helps!|`|XlyLakYAaa	I currently don't own a laptop, only a desktop.

To change where it searches you need to tell it to search your USB Stick. You can do this by going to the "NOW PLAYING" button and selecting the "More Options" button. PLUG IN THE USB device. Then wait a sec. Then select the DEVICES tab, and chose REFRESH and select your USB device. If you plan on saving many playlists to the USB device you can download a program that is free and works great. <br>  <br>  Here is a website on a tutorial for using it once you download it. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2288886_media-player-playlist-usb-drive.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2288886_media-pl...</a>|`|az2ZBy3iaa	Did you transfer the music files the play list refers to along with it?
FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like adware.  I suggest you download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (they’re free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesn’t seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode. <br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  <br>  6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.<br>  <br>  Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nu4h6C04aa	I checked the link you provided, you have been infiltrated by spyware. This is a pop up that directs you to buy from the advertisement.

3dv7Qdoxaa	Well, laptops lose A LOT of their value as soon as you buy them (something like 25% of their value). And seeing how this is more than a year old, doesn't even have 1 gig of RAM, and only has a single core CPU, you're not going to get very much for this. <br>  <br>  I would guess around $300, but that's being generous. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I don't see how Vista could possibly run smoothly on that thing. It must have been so choppy and slow. I don't even think it meets Vista's minimum requirements.
wUqeZl3Saa	Here is roughly what the police or any other law enforcement agency has to do in order for your computer files to be used as evidence.<br>  <br>  First, they have to create a duplicate of your hard drive without changing any data on the drive. This is often done with a hardware device (expensive high tech), plugged into another computer (cheap low tech) or read using a live Linux CD (also cheap low tech). Note that at no time did anyone actually boot up your computer and access anything like you might normally do. This makes key loggers and any other spyware useless.<br>  <br>  Careful records are maintained of who had possession of the computer and various hardware pieces along with what was done with times and dates. Cryptographic hashes or message digests are created to prove the data copied is the same as the original. The same happens with any copies they may make so that there is a chain of evidence. The evidence is useless in court without the records as it might have been tampered with.<br>  <br>  Once the copies are made, then the police can begin examining the data contained there. Extra copies can be made and even booted without having to worry about changing data on the original or evidence copies. Searches will be made of existing files as well as unused file blocks and unused space since these places often retain information long after the original file is deleted. Again, anything found will be carefully documented. Evidence found would be forwarded to the prosecutor and decisions made from there.<br>  <br>  So far, that is just what might happen in our nice idealistic view of the legal system. In most cases, this is almost exactly what would happen. However, not everyone is so nice.<br>  <br>  Now we can take a look at what might happen if we had a corrupt legal system.<br>  <br>  Instead of duplicating your hard drive, some of the same or similar tools could be used to modify your hard drive. Again, your computer might never actually boot the existing operating system. Instead a live CD could be booted and modifications made to the hard drive. Times and dates could also be modified and adjusted as needed. Now that the hard drive has the "evidence" on it, it may be copied and the records made as above in the normal procedure. Note that no key logger or any other security software had a chance to detect the changes.<br>  <br>  If you think the legal system has actually done something like this, it would take an expert in computer forensics to even have half a chance of catching them. The only part that might give them away would be the time line of events if they didn't forge the paperwork properly. Perhaps a picture might have an embedded time and date stamp that didn't fit with the time and date on the computer.<br>  <br>  As you can see, there isn't much of a defense if they seize your computer. In some cases judges have even forced defendants to give up their passwords in cases where strong encryption and strong passwords were used.<br>  <br>  Obviously you don't want someone like me in physical possession of your computer. I could look at, find or modify anything if I had the desire. And no one would ever know I was there.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf.|`|6kvyXUNWaa	This wouldn't even happen.<br>  The police wouldn't deliberately put things on your computer :S<br>  <br>  You'd have the stuff on your computer already, which is why the police would arrest you and search your house.<br>  <br>  Duh.<br>  And anyway, I'm guessing it would take a lot of programming to do this.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	Get a keylogger.

If after doing<br>  everything again. Try running the tool without safemode. When the tool or Norton finds the trojan, write down the location of the file or files.

Although most newer motherboards support the 2.0 spec it's not a big deal if yours is version 1.1  - they are completely backwards compatible, so the 2.0 video cards work in regular x16 slots.<br>  <br>  Update: The GPU-Z program mentioned above is quite handy- give it a try!|`|yqqVPcU0aa	The best answer so far is by, "d_oh26, and Vulcan", but I'd like to add.  The colour of an interface doesn't determine its type or make.  So for people to suggest the colour of the interface may determine the type you have is bunk.  <br>  <br>  Chances are, if the computer was made after 2007 if it specifies PCIe x16 its will be 2.0.  Only older models and probably second hand or refurbished units will have the older 1.0 slots.|`|NGzsGTegaa	Easiest thing to do is look on the motherboard's manufacturing website.<br>  PCI Express x16 refers really to the size of the slot (in my mind) i believe.<br>  <br>  Some boards show them, some done.

a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	Trojans are programs that don't do what you think they will. They pretend to be something else, like a picture or another application. If you open a trojan it can then run and do what ever evil the programmer intended. <br>  <br>  Viruses on the other hand don't need user intervention to run, they just need a vulnerability in the OS that they can exploit. <br>  <br>  No OS can ever be 100% safe from trojans because all the malware writer needs to do is fool the user if the user has adminstrator rights — except on Windows, where all software has admin rights, so all they have to do is fool any user! <br>  <br>  Viruses need to fool the OS, and most operating systems (other than Windows) have user level permissions that make it very difficult for a virus to even run, and still more difficult for it to affect anything if it does run.|`|b92ed6ec66e5f947f15f4122686a6bc0aa	All are different and need different tools to remove.<br>  1.

Currently there is 10.4 out with 10.5 to be released sometime in the near future, but unlike with Windows it's very easy to upgrade from one to the other.  The more important question is do you want to spend money on an older Apple with them now making the switch to Intel processors.  In the near future software beyond the operating system will start to be made for Intel Macs and the support for PowerPC Macs will start to fade.<br>  <br>  Not sure if this is a laptop you plan to use for a long time or what you plan to do with it, but that's my $.02

Know what you are going to say, i.e. rehearse and just try to relax.

The class will think you are looking at them, and the teacher will think you are looking at your audience.<br>  <br>  Don't notice any reaction from the class. Their reaction doesn't matter, but it might make you feel more nervous.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on what you are saying rather than how you are saying it. <br>  <br>  Don't try to keep from stuttering as that will make you stutter more. If you stutter, just let it happen.<br>  <br>  Maintain a steady pace, not too fast, and don't get in a hurry to "get it over with."  <br>  <br>  Speak in a relaxed manner and pause every so often.<br>  <br>  Start into words easily keeping your lips, tongue, and jaw relaxed.|`|x785DXRBaa	stare at some place but have your eyes cruse so is not to bring up superstition. also have you speech or what ever memorized well enough.

Have your notes with you and don't be afraid to use them.<br>  You probably feel like you are taking ages to glance down at them, but don't panic as no-one else will be thinking that.<br>  <br>  If there is someone you know in the audience then being able to look at them will make you feel better. Or if there is someone you can practice in front of thats great too.<br>  <br>  Personally I have found that the more I do it the better it gets. Just relax, take a breath if you need to and don't rush. Most people end up speaking too quickly when they are nervous but don't realise it!
FBQZ06vraa	Not a problem.  We'll fix it by changing your global template.  NOTE:  THIS METHOD WILL NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER CHANGES YOU'VE MADE TO THE TEMPLATE.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):<br>  <br>  1. Close all open copies of Word.<br>  2. Open Word.<br>  3. Click on the File->Save As menu item.<br>  4. In the "File of Type" list box, scroll down to Document Templates and select it.  The directory should change and there should be a Normal.dot file in it.  DON’T SAVE THE FILE.  Click Cancel instead.<br>  5. Press CTRL/O.<br>  6. Select Normal.dot.  Normal.dot should become your open document.<br>  7. Now delete all the text in the document, including text in any headers and footers.  Pressing CTRL/A followed by the Delete key is the fastest way to do this.<br>  8. Save the file with CTRL/S.  You may get a warning message about the Global template having been changed.  This is OK.  Click Yes.<br>  9. Close Word.<br>  <br>  In Word 2007:<br>  <br>  1. Close all open copies of Word.<br>  2. Open Word.<br>  3. Click on the round Office button in the upper-left corner of the window.<br>  4. Click Open.<br>  5. Select Templates in the Favorite Links pane.<br>  6. Select Normal.dotm or Normal.dotx. This should become your open document.<br>  7. Now delete all the text in the document, including text in any headers and footers.  Pressing CTRL/A followed by the Delete key is the fastest way to do this.<br>  8. Save the file with CTRL/S.  You may get a warning message about the Global template having been changed.  This is OK.  Click Yes.<br>  9. Close Word.<br>  <br>  Word sometimes leaves the last directory used incorrectly set, so the next time you open or save (especially!) a file, be careful that Word's pointed at the right place.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	1) Macs are immune to Windows viruses, and there are still no Mac OS X viruses. Even after nearly 6 years on the market, and with 'computer security' companies spending money and resources to come up with proof of concept Mac viruses in order to sell their software to Mac users, there are still 0 Mac viruses. <br>  <br>  2) Macs can run lots more software than PCs. Only Macs can run OS X and all of its applications as well as Windows and Linux and their applications.<br>  <br>  3) Macs are easier to use. This one is a little less obvious because on the surface one gui looks about the same as another. Spend some time using a Mac though, and you'll discover that just about everything is a little easier, making the overall experience much more enjoyable. Connecting devices is a snap. No "please wait while windows installs your... hard drive, display, etc. because they just work on a Mac. <br>  <br>  4) Mac users are almost all experienced PC users who have chosen the Mac. We know how to use a PC, but we also know the Mac is better. Think of it this way: If the Mac weren't better than a PC, it wouldn't survive in the market place. IT departments everywhere love the PC (it creates work, and therefore job security) and so they lock out the Mac. Many of the employees of these companies erroneously believe they need to buy Windows to be compatible with their work computers. In order to compete, Apple has no choice but to make the Mac OS better than Windows, but Microsoft has no such imperative. No matter how bad Windows is, IT departments refuse to allow alternatives, and MS knows it.|`|edd18bd762f551c58994efe38fcd3162aa	Well other than the exploding battery fiasco it's all really a matter of personal taste as there isn't much to choose between them nowadays.

The resolution is too low, it is not secure, it adds to long distance charges, and it wastes paper and toner/ink.<br>  <br>  A much better solution is to use a scanner to create higher resolution black and white PDF (Adobe Reader) files of documents. You can email them to anyone and everyone and have a record of the email, the recipients can choose to print out some or all of the document so they don't waste paper, and there are no toll charges! What's more, emails are less likely to be seen by prying eyes, and since you've already scanned the document, storing it is easier and safer (you do make backups, right?) than paper.

Most viruses are written for the Windows operating system.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are running Windows, you need, at a minimum, a decent anti-virus running in background at all times.  Such an anti-virus is free AVG.  You can find it here:<br>  <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1" rel="nofollow">http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1</a><br>  <br>  Also, you need a firewall.  Windows XP does has its' own built-in firewall, but you may wish to install a free firewall.  Such a firewall is the free version of Zone Alarm and you can find that here:<br>  <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/home.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/ho...</a><br>  <br>  Both of the above are excellent products.<br>  <br>  If you are running XP, please make sure that you have created both an administrator account and one or more user accounts.  Only use the user account(s) when you are on the Internet.  This denies any potential buggers access to administrator privileges and will go a long way to protect you.<br>  <br>  The last thing you can do concerns e-mail.  Do not open any e-mail from anyone you don't know and treat suspiciously any attachments even sent by friends.  Make sure your preview pane is turned off in Outlook Express.  If the preview pane is on, simply selecting a message will expose your computer to potential harm.  You should not see the contents of any message until you double-click to open it.<br>  <br>  If you do have the preview screen on, go to Outlook Express, select "view", then "layout".  At that point, simply uncheck the box marked "show preview pane".<br>  <br>  Oh, one last point.  Do *not* visit sites that may well be dangerous.  This would include sites dedicated to hacking (sites offering cracks to legitimate software so you can 'enjoy' them for free).  Not only is this illegal, many of these sites can - and will - try to infect your machine.

a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	Alright, I've got a solution. If column A has deposits/withdrawls(-) and column B is the running balance, put the opening balance at the top of column A and use the following formula for column b, starting at B1:<br>  =SUM(A$1:A1)<br>  <br>  Now you can copy the formula down. When you insert a row, just copy the formula into the new empty cell in column B.<br>  <br>  It works because SUM adds all the values from the fixed A1 cell (the $ forces the 1 to remain fixed) up to the current cell. A1 becomes A2 when the formula is copied to B2, A3 in B3, and so on.

tOCESHLYaa	Well Norton is one of the strongest but if for some reason your is not working right, I give you some more options. Kaspersky Internet Security is a top program, it also offers a free trial. Bitdefender is also good. Also has a free trial. But note if you are getting infected a lot it's probably not you security software. It's the things your doing, NO program will protect you if you have bad internet habits. If you use P2P file sharing and don't know how to check files using more than you anti-virus programs.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	If you want a suite, use Kaspersky. Very strong anti-malware protection plus the best firewall of any suite (excluding Comodo Suite, AV not tested), see <a href="http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewall-challenge/results.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, use NOD32 and OnlineArmor free firewall. <br>  <br>  You can protect your pc for free but the solutions above will be easier.<br>  <br>  No single program (or suite) can guarantee 100% protection. I'd suggest suing Firefox with NoScript to protect yourself from XSS attacks, or IE8 when it's released. NoScript is a bit of a pita at first but when you get accustomed to it, it's a godsend.<br>  <br>  It's also VERY important to keep your other software up-to-date, a lot of malware gets on pc's via exploits in programs such as Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Apple QuickTime, Java, etc. The easiest way is to use Secunia PSI. This will scan your pc once a week and inform you of any insecure programs.

tOCESHLYaa	Well, Danny there is no way. You can help by having a good anti-virus program. Like Norton,Kaspersky, or Nod32. It is a must that you scan the files before opening them. Here's the problem new Malware is written to fool your anti-virus protection. Since a big part of your protection is Signature based detection if its new and your av does not have a Signature for it. You are going to get infected. You av will also use Heuristics detection which will catch stuff the av does not have a signature for, at best this may have a 50% detection rate. Plus this method is prone to false positives. So if you use limewire you may be able to go a long time with out getting infected. But sooner or later you mostly will.|`|ytl2PONXaa	How not to get infected: Don't use it.|`|nGUeZDJcaa	First of all, there is no surefire protection, so be prepared.  Limewire is relatively safe as long as you take the proper precautions.  Use a good quality anti-virus, preferably one with a p2p shield.  (p2p is what limewire is, it means peer to peer or user to user data transmissions)  I recommend Kaspersky Internet Security myself.  Then, set your files to be downloaded to a specific directory.  I would use something like "Needs Scanned".  After you're finished downloading, scan that directory with your antivirus, just to be safe, and then move the files somewhere to be used.  Do not use them until after you scan them, and do not use the preview feature.  Beyond that, Spybot S&D or AdAware are good help too, but they don't get along with Kaspersky.  Good luck!|`|E0JA8O0Daa	On limewire you can download something and it will turn out to be a virus.

nGUeZDJcaa	It is not overly difficult to repair, if you're fairly tech-savvy.  I can do one in about 20-30 minutes.  Typically, it's just a matter of removing the (usually)5 screws holding the lcd casing together, prying it apart, unplugging the 2 cables that run to the lcd, and then installing the new one with the reverse process.  Not something I suggest doing unless you are familiar with working on a pc though.  The signal cable can be a bit tricky sometimes, and getting into each laptop is different, so it won't always be just like this.  You're going to spend anywhere from around $75-$150 for the lcd, and any good computer shop would do the labor for about that again.  Roughly $150-$300 to have someone else do it, but buy the lcd on your own to avoid the markup.  Good luck!

z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson CX5000 and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|z8MqokTLaa	hi friend which printer have  latest feature .which is you want<br>  with resonable price . that best printer for you , there is website where youb can find all type of information about the printers it's<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/Index.aspx?CategoryId=46" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a>|`|aqXFnZpkaa	buy hp because its the best<br>  <br>  and make sure you get all in one because you never know when you might need a Scanner or fax so instead of buying separate just buy all in one , that's what i did :D<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER buy the dell cheap printers or photo 926 because they are Absolutely rubbish <br>  <br>  i hope that answers your question <br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|mKNj0wDEaa	i think a hp/canon printer is best they are cheap and durable, because i have both and i had them from i was 19 and now i'm 29 and they are working oh so fine still!|`|NpxzICoraa	i think the best would be the HP coloured printer, i have one iand i think it fits what you need. it's a really good printer<br>  :)|`|Dwz1se0Saa	HP make shitty computers but they're printers are really nice.

jHuIwZl8aa	No need to contact HP. Here is what you do. Unplug the USB cable from the printer and power it on.<br>  <br>  Now re-install the software and let it advise you when to connect the USB cable. When it does, connect it and let it complete installation.<br>  <br>  Reboot and windows will find your new hardware.Nop open up Photoshop or the scanner softwarethat came with your HP and it will work. : -)|`|tg50ejAAaa	Contact the technical support for hp from their website.  Pick the chat online with a support technician choice.  Perhaps you have Microsoft Vista but the full features of the printer are only supported on older versions such as Microsoft Windows XP.  If you need to install the drivers again to see the HP Director program just reinstall the printer driver for your printer that is appropriate for your computer operating system.  Visit the hp.com website for all of these things.

AA11434745	It depends on who your Web host is. If you use GoDaddy, you can go into Hosting Manager, choose the File Manager, and edit the .htaccess file directly.<br>  <br>  If your Web host uses cPanel, you should be able to directly edit your .htaccess file under the file manager.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, to edit .htaccess on most other Web hosts, you need to have shell access and use a shell client, such as Putty.<br>  <br>  In *nix / Apache, .htaccess files are special. While technically they are just text files, *nix / Apache treats them differently than just any old document.<br>  <br>  Also, you really don't want to be monkeying around in .htaccess unless you know what you are doing. Mistakes there can prevent your Web site from working or crash the server; many Web hosts therefore disable the ability to edit .htaccess files, especially free hosts.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you don't use FTP to send your files to your site, you have your site mapped as a network drive (I don't know of any other way you can be transferring files back and forth).  .htaccess is just another text file.  Download it, edit it in Notepad and send it back.|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	You access .htaccess via ftp just like all your other website's files.

aaTXQba4aa	You could use Audacity (free recording software) to record it. <br>  Then plug a headphone splitter into the headphone jack on your computer. <br>  Plug a double-male cable into one hole on the splitter and headphones into the other.<br>   Plug the other end of the double-male into a splitter plugged into the microphone jack. <br>  Plug your microphone into the other slot of that splitter. <br>  Record as normal. <br>  You can listen to your friend using the headphones and now it will record everything your computer plays as well.

That is, it stops most of the crap ever getting on your pc. It auto-updates the malware database and the program itself. However, it doesn't auto-scan, that has to be done manually. AntiVir (free version of Avira) has no spyware protection. AVG... is AVG. Say no more.<br>  <br>  Avira was declared Anti-Virus of the Year 2008 by <a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.av-comparatives.org</a> narrowly beating NOD32.<br>  <br>  So, Avast is great for a freebie but I'd stick with Avira.|`|tOCESHLYaa	I don't know who told you that but it isn't true Avira Premium is one of the best. It was the anti-virus software of the year at av-comparatives Which is the top testing lab. It is always at the top or near the top in all the legit testing sites. It is a very good security program. Avast is also good for a free program. But it does not compare to Avira. Who ever told you Avast was better than Avira is someone you should not ask for security advise about computers. I don't use Avira because I don't like the interface and there are a few other things I don't care for. But where it matters Protection it is strong,
tOCESHLYaa	Try turning on your computer and as soon as you do at the very start before windows can try and boot hit the DEL key or F2 to enter set up then Enter the BIOS Setup Utility  then locate the option for changing the boot order. Now change the boot order so it will boot from CD ROM drive or DVD drive Make sure you Exit Saving Changes Choose Yes when prompted to save your BIOS configuration changes and exit. Now hopefully you can boot from your windows cd and do a repair or reinstall windows.

AA11434745	Please post code on the Web and link to it. Too much code = tl;dr, which is why you waited so long for an answer. If you post code to the Web, we can visit the link and view the source ourselves.<br>  <br>  You're using depricated HTML tags such as center, big, font. All of these will meddle with how your CSS is rendered. Get rid of them. Use CSS only to style your elements.<br>  <br>  Your menu links are also improperly quoted, that's surely causing your HTML to break and thus, your CSS inheritance to go haywire.<br>  <br>  There is no center argument for the CSS float directive.<br>  <br>  You know what? I'm going to stop here, even though I see at least six more glaring errors. Your code is a mess.

kJMLIH89aa	Drawback, none(exceot for no gaming and the price). Apple computers are well built. In my opinion they are made better than any other computer company. They are very reliable and the Apple support team it great. Plus The macbook gives you the option to run Vista or XP if you like windows.<br>  And it runs windows better than any other computer. I have Vista installed on my mac, It has never given me any issues whatsoever in the year that I've had it, while a very hi quality HP with Vista crashed several times in the week i put up with it.<br>  <br>  In regards to running programs. It runs well. It comes with everything you need to get started making dvds or cds, listening to music or whatever media things you want to do. <br>  <br>  Regardless Macbook is a great choice I encourage you pursue it. You will not regret it. Good luck.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Well, Macs are overpriced.  I use the term "overpriced" instead of "expensive" because "expensive" sometimes implies that you're paying more for a better product, which is not necessarily the case here. Apple just charges more.  Period.  Macs are also terrible for gaming, don't have a right-mouse button, and I personally find most Mac software cumbersome to use and restrictive.<br>  <br>  Of course, Acer isn't exactly a killer brand either so it's up to you, though I'd throw down that money on a killer PC laptop if it were me.

f73Nk6H0aa	I don't think that there is a way to password protect JUST the history of the browser. But there is indeed a way how to password protect all the browser you use, Mozilla Firefox has a plugin or addon that once you install it, it give you the ability to password protect all the browser so nobody can use it without a password. everytime you start the browser you need to provide the password. I am sure this is better.<br>  Keep in mind Mozilla Firefox is waaaay better than any other browser.|`|M9OtxhVZaa	The only way I think that meets your situation is that you should password protect your browser and let others use other browsers.<br>  <br>  You may use Empathy to password protect your browser.

Sentient life was not intended to be subjected to constant bombardment of energy waves. not only is our atmosphere depleting allowing alot more radiation in that is supposed to be here, but we are surrounded by devices that are constantly emitting fields of slowly harmfull radio and all kinds of energy waves. one way or another you and everyone around you is going to be subject to this potentially dangerous conditions. I say potentially for a reason. and this is how the morons making this all happen are looking at it all. Im sure you have heard of the Chernobyl disaster? A nuclear power plan that had a full melt down..well im sure you can imagine how EXTREMELY horribly dangerous it would be to stand in front of a burning exposed nuclear power core? Well..believe it or not, not everyone who was there that day got cancer and died. Even under extream exposure its a game of chance. sure the odds that you dont get anything from that kind of exposure are billions to 1, but its possible. <br>  This is why our world is a veritable play ground of unseen harmfull 'waves'<br>  Their other excuse is funny too. The stuff is coming from space, naturally. I guess they figure a little more wont hurt...<br>  lol|`|AA11746368	The type of waves that come from a laptop can't cause birth defects or cancer.

j8G3WkI2aa	Be more specific please...what distribution of Linux are you planning to use?|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Yum is actually pretty straightforward.  I have successfully upgraded from Fedora 8 to Fedora 9 then to Fedora 10 (which I discovered unlike 8 and 9 I despised) with it.  You can just do a yum search vlc then a yum install whatever it tells you vlcplayer is called (I'm addicted to mplayer) and it will install it and put it on your menu so you can run it.  Whoever was talking about entering lines of code is making things more complicated than they are.|`|v6BcjOdWaa	"yum" is the easier way.<br>  There is no linux 6.1. What kind of distribution do you have in mind?<br>  <br>  By saying "portable version", you are talking about Windows binary. Your binary must be Linux compatible, plus same architecture with your CPU.<br>  I believe PS3 is using IBM Cell CPU. I'm not sure i386 or i686 will work with it.<br>   <br>  Your program must be compiled to run on linux and on your specific CPU whether it's Intel/AMD(i386, i686), Power, Cell, MIPS, etc.<br>   <br>  You see, yum is much easier. Just enter few lines according to your hardware and preferences, and you don't have to worry about anything I mentioned above.|`|a4da36557b90cbf554ded329d557968eaa	RTFM on yum. yum will download and install it for you.<br>  <br>  it also makes it incredibly easy to update anything.<br>  Once you do RTFM, and get yum to work, you will realize how stupid your question is.
BhNP2P8Xaa	No. AVG is just as good at protection (for whatever that's worth, considering it's Windows) and it doesn't hog the system up the way Norton or the others do.<br>  <br>  Why would you pay for something when you have a free application that works just as well. Just make sure you keep it updated.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Yes, definitely. Norton 2009 is vastly improved over previous versions but I still wouldn't use it, Have a look on YA and see how many Norton users are having real problems getting rid of Trojan.Brisv.A! <br>  <br>  If you want a freebie, Avast is the one to go for. Protects in real-time against viruses, spyware and rootkits, unlike AntiVir (no spyware protection) and AVG (no rootkit protection).<br>  <br>  If you'd prefer the advantages of a pay-for program, NOD32 and Kaspersky are excellent. Also, Avira and BitDefender are worth a look.|`|c6zBPGooaa	Norton is the worst anti-virus out there. (As well as McAfee)<br>  <br>  AVG is fine, but if you feel insecure you could always just get a second anti-virus. SUPERAntiSpyware is good in my opinion.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	It's better than Norton... everything is better than norton.  You should try Avast though, its free and better than AVG.|`|4d779faaa4228bfedcf323ac5a731e21aa	use AVAST Home. it is excellent software and it is 100% free|`|iAw1q6kbaa	no just keep it .........|`|a96e3e71fffb30e3deea2fd3af2a48f1aa	AVG sucks....even though its free it still SUCK's because its TOO BIG and doesn't catch much.

But here's the catch:With ink, you only get a few hundred copies per catridge...for lasers, you get a few THOUSAND.  So it costs you more initially, and the cartriges are around $100-$150 a pop, but, you only have to replace them once or twice a year...in the end, your saving money the laser way, after about a year or so...<br>  <br>  But you choose...|`|z46THMt8aa	The question is about quality, not the price of ink.

VPCl2C9daa	very funny!|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	There is a new virus moving around pretty quickly. It's called W32.Lirva.A@mm. This is a mass-mailing worm that propagates itself via email and open network shares (chat programs, file sharing programs, etc). It attempts to stop anti-virus software and firewalls as well as email cached passwords from your system to the author of the virus. On the 7th, 11th and 24th of each month it will open your browser to www.avril-lavigne.com and display a graphic animation on your desktop. This worm takes advantage of a vulnerability in MS Outlook which allows the virus to auto-execute when previewed.

Most manufacturers  put a function key to control whether or not the touchpad is enabled.  Its usually something like Fn+F9.  The Fn key will be at the bottom left next to the Control and Alt keys.  Hold that down and hit F9.  If that doesn't work, and it might not cause dude, u got a dell, I think Dell has an option in the BIOS to turn on/off the touchpad.  When your computer is first booting up, hit F2 when you see the big blue Dell logo, and that will take you to the bios.  Navigate around until you find the touchpad enable/disable and if its disabled, enable it.  That should do ya!  good luck!|`|KLpN10Icaa	Call Dell?  reboot your computer?

Since a keylogger does not track where and what you click, this helps you to get around it in times of urgency. Typing with the on-screen keylogger is a great hassle. The only alternative is the remove the keylogger completely.<br>  <br>  Before you can destroy the keylogger and make your compute safe, you will need to detect it.  Right click on your menu bar and click Task Manager.  You should be looking at all the applications you are running at the moment. Click the tab that says Processes. This gives you information about all the programs, hidden and visible that your computer is currently running.<br>  <br>  The keylogger will show up on the list of processes as well as many other programs and background processes. However, you may not be able to distinguish between the different processes.<br>  <br>  You will need to know which process to end before you can stop the keylogger. There are many sites available on the Internet that provides a vast amount of information on each and every process that you may encounter. One of these sites is Liutilities. This site provides some background information on each process as well as telling you the author and which program it is part of. One of the best features of this site includes a recommendation about what to do with that process. <br>  Another fantastic site for information on processes is Neuber. As with Liutilities, Neuber gives you background information on that process. <br>  <br>  However, some find it hard and long drawn out to research each process individually. Thankfully, there is a program called Security Task Manager that is free to download. It will display information about each of the processes that are currently running, as well as telling you if they are dangerous or not. You will immediately be notified should anything harmful come up. <br>  <br>  Once you have found the harmful process, click the process and then click the 'End Process' button towards the bottom right. The process you have selected should be terminated immediately.<br>  Once this is complete, you should be safe until you reboot your computer. If you do not delete the keylogger, upon rebooting your computer, the keylogger will start up again. <br>  <br>  Keyloggers are usually located in the system files, so do not delete anything that you aren't 100% sure is the keylogger. Doing so may lead to errors in other areas of the computer. Go to 411-spyware and search for the type of keylogger that has infected your system. If it is listed, there should be instructions about how to manually remove the keylogger. <br>  <br>  A great way to check if the keylogger has been completely removed from the system is to reboot. Remember the name of the keylogger's process and reboot the computer. If the process is not there when the computer has rebooted, you are safe."|`|f73Nk6H0aa	To both of you above, it is very easy to remove it once you spotted it. You just need some technical easy skills. If you spotted the keylogger this mean you know its location on the PC. saying for example the file called keylogger.exe and it is just in the C: so the path for it is:<br>  C:\keylogger.exe<br>  restart you computer and keep pushing F8 button a list will appear and choose start in safe mode, once started go to C: and find keylogger.exe and delete it from your hard drive. if it is still protected and can't be removed this way, find a Dos boot CD then boot under Dos and type this command:<br>  Del C:\keylogger.exe<br>  this for sure gonna erase it. keep in mind that was only an example, i am sure in your situation the file name and path are different, so use the method i gave you and destroy it.<br>  Sometimes a keylogger can be protected by its attributes, for this in Dos use this command first:<br>  Attrib -ASRH keylogger.exe

ELF5Y6IQaa	I wouldn't buy either. HP makes the best printers for home or commercial use.|`|z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|herE0rJFaa	If you let me in the Canon Pixma MX700 or Epson WorkForce 600 a selection, I will select Canon Pixma MX700, in this website:<a href="http://www.printprovide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.printprovide.com</a> you can find what you need

C8DOT8Y7aa	Confirmation and Preliminary Action: <br>  Make a list of ways your computer is showing signs of abnormal operation. Satisfy yourself that these signs are not due to hardware failure or problems with attached equipment. Sometimes people misdiagnose software problems (such as bugs in Outlook Express or printer drivers) as virus activity. Also, problems with the Registry can be a source of errors, this happens if you install and uninstall lots of programs. <br>  Run your virus-scanner, but beware, many modern viruses can circumvent (or hide from) common anti-virus programs. Norton Antivirus and Mcafee have both been seen to exhibit this weakness, or seem unable to remove certain strains. <br>  Check access to System Restore & the Internet. <br>  Check computer for system access - Try to disable System Restore - right-click My Computer and select properties. Turn off System Restore on all drives. <br>  Download and install new Anti-Virus. Both AVG Free Edition and Avast! are highly acclaimed programs. Install one of them (see External Links). Update the program's virus definitions. Don't scan for viruses yet. <br>  Install Spybot Search & Destroy or Webroot Spysweeper (see External Links), and update its definitions. Don't scan for malware yet. <br>  Install Adaware Personal Edition (see External Links) and update its definitions. Don't scan for malware yet. <br>  Reboot into Safe Mode - Restart your computer and press F8 before Windows loads. Press F8 several times if you need to. Select Safe Mode from the resulting menu. Safe Mode disables much of the startup routine (including some common Malware hiding places). <br>  Run your Anti-Virus - Run the freshly installed Anti-Virus.

How the kernel is structured facilitates an environment in which makes it extremely secure.<br>  <br>  That said, there are some distros that are more secure than others. If you are concerned about the security of your system, take a look and google and you will find an ample amount of linux distributions that are used solely for their security.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|g4ubbgmqaa	Linux.com recommends that you use firewall and malware scanners and yes if your linux get's hit it can infect your windows operating system...malware loads to the ram and waits for you to boot windows|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	The only security you need for Linux is the firewall that comes with it, i believe its called firestarter and you have to enable it, Thats it.

What you need is an anti-virus and a firewall.<br>  My suggestion to you is to get a "suite" that means trojan, anti-virus and firewall is included.<br>  Personally i use ZoneAlarm but that might be a little bit complicated if you're not god with computers. NOD32 is a good program for beginners.<br>  Google it and try a trial, or buy, cheap programs.<br>  If you're certain you have virus in the computer I'd not have my internet plugged in if  I were you.<br>  <br>  Oh nad be sure to get the "suite" that gives complete protection!|`|vFpzf8Omaa	Over a month ago, I was stupid enough to get a trojan (Im only 12 jeezzz) and my friend Tyler gave me a link to this great virus/trojan remover .

Most small businesses fail within five years, and yours is destined to fail within five months because you don't have a clue how to create the product you want to sell. You're not going to be able to get any investors and if you fund it yourself you're just going to lose money.<br>  <br>  But if you really dream of having a software company let me suggest a couple options. First, go to college and study computer science and business. You'll learn how to write programs and how business works. Then go to work for someone else for a while. Hone your skills and when you make mistakes it will be at someone else's expense. You'll eventually get to a point where you have learned enough to go out on your own.<br>  <br>  Second option is to find someone who knows how to create programs and for a company around them. You better have something you bring to the table (business knowledge, money, some other kinds of skills).<br>  <br>  Either way you're getting the cart ahead of the horse by asking this question right now.

AA0MuMt3aa	If it can't read the disc, check through these things:<br>  - The disc isn't scratched<br>  - You haven't moved your laptop around violently while it's been reading a disc<br>  - The disc is actually made to be read by Vista computers (e.g. it's not an Super Mario CD from the 90's that you're trying to run.) You can check if it can be read by Vista computers by looking at the back of the box that the disc came in, then at the bottom there's a long white box with "System Requirements", and it tells you what you need to make the disc work on your computer. In one of the first white boxes, it says what sort of system it can run in, if you read it you can see if it can run with Vista or if it was only made for older versions.<br>  - Your serial number doesn't make a difference to whether your disc drive can read discs or not, it's just there so if you contact your providers and they can identify your laptop.<br>  - Usually the websites are no help because the workers know nothing/speak "computer talk"/completely ignore you and what you're trying to tell them/have no idea what they're saying/are actually a machine/make it out that you're an idiot/always go back to "System Restore" because it's the easiest way but can get rid of important files.<br>  - And in general, Vista sucks.<br>  - If your computer is new however, and you haven't had any major files saved on there, you can use System Restore actually. (When they suggest they use it for any case without thinking). If you do have precious stuff on your computer, then back it up by using USB keys (they're little square things you can buy in any computer shop and they hold information for you, like how you save stuff on your computer, you can save it onto the USB key), or an external hard drive (there's a big square thing inside your computer which holds all your information, again in computer shops you buy the square thing and it holds much more space than a USB key), then use system restore. <br>  I'm not sure how to do system restore, so you might want to research on the internet how or ask family/friends who are good with computers.<br>  And before I forget, what system restore actually does is, it just resets your computer to a certain date. So if you restored your computer to the date you bought it, it would practically get rid of any changes etc that happened to the computer from that date onwards.<br>  After restoring, if you choose to do so, try your disc again. If it doesn't work, I'm not sure. Remember, restoring is a last choice thing. Don't do it if you don't have to.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|mI1SUfozaa	Don't enter your serial number on any websites, you could try downloading a torrent of it but htat could have a virus or 2 on it, you should try phoning micorosft reg number and they may send you a new copy if they are happy with the serial|`|FTG6M0Luaa	If you just bought it then you can call whoever made your laptop and they will fix it for free.

For $1.50, it usually fixes even the worst of scratches.<br>  <br>  As for downloading, i doubt you can get it from microsoft (calling their support isn't a bad idea), but a vista install disk should be widely available on many bit torrent trackers, and using your cd key, you should be ok.  That's a little bit of a grey area in legality, but i highly doubt, that even if legal action was pushed against you, that you would have any trouble.

f9e770ce7acedfbe26ea2888a0df7103aa	1>Java's serialization process does not serialize classes, but<br>  objects: instances of a class. <br>  2>serialization produces a byte stream, not a String.<br>  3> And as mentioned, Serialized objects don't produce character<br>  (String) data, they're binary.<br>  <br>  As,Serialization involves saving the current state of an object to a stream, and restoring an equivalent object from that stream. The stream functions as a container for the object.the information stored in the container can later be used to construct an equivalent object containing the same data as the original.<br>  <br>  The Serializable interface relies on the Java runtime default mechanism to save an object's state. Writing an object is done via the writeObject() method in the ObjectOutputStream class (or the ObjectOutput interface). Writing a primitive value may be done through the appropriate write<datatype>() method. Reading the serialized object is accomplished using the readObject() method of the ObjectInputStream class, and primitives may be read using the various read<datatype>() methods. <br>  <br>  String manier times needs to be reconstructed hence it is implementing serializable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this resolves your issues<br>  Cheers:)

vL2Ec50Yaa	I did a Google search and was not able to find instructions on how to create a recovery partition with Vista Ultimate on it.  I think it can be done, but it will take a lot of research to find the instructions.<br>  <br>  I would turn on your computer, insert the Ultimate disk and see if it will allow you do do an 'upgrade'.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, reboot your system with the Ultimate disk in the cd drive, boot to the disk first, and when the computer question comes up as to what partition you want to install to, choose the larger partition.<br>  <br>  BUT, the very first thing I would do is download 'driver genius' and run it to create an 'exe' file and put it on external media so it will make it easier to install the drivers once you have installed the Ultimate Vista.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
