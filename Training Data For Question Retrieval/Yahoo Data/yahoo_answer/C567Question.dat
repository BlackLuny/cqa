20090309131844AA0ktay	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Wondering about the future and living with hydrocephalus?	My son had his first shunt surgery at age 2.5 months and has had numerous revisions since then...he's now 25.  He worked for three years starting at age 15 at a fast food restaurant.  After he left there, he has been let go by one job after the other.  There's always been a reason stated that is tough to fight.  He's called lazy and has always been due to problems stemming from the hydrocephalus.  Anyway, we did try for SSI and were told that he would have to have a lengthy record of doctor visits to verify depression..with no insurance that became impossible to do.  We tried again and a lawyer told us that due to his work history of the fast food place, he would not qualify.  He has been working for a year now at a furniture store where the boss is a wonderful lady who has let him keep his job even though he has been getting very ill with the usual shunt malfunction problems of vomiting, unbearable headaches, and back aches too.  He misses a few days each month.  With no insurance it's hard to have him checked out by a doctor.  They only hire less than full time so no insurance there.  He is very fortunate to have the job but needs insurance.  My question is: what do others do who have hydrocephalus? is SSI a possibility?  has anyone fought and won?  Any help with this would be appreciated greatly.  Thank you.

Okay, so I have posted this question before, but i have to post it again for more answers and  i will tell you details, that may better help you decide.      Alright, so HI, i am a girl 13 years old, but i am turning 14 in about 3 months. I got a cell phone in grade 6 and two days later i had a terrible migraine, i convinced my mom to take me to the doctor and they said i had a migraine(it lasted 7 whole days!) they said i would get them because my mom has migraines every 6 months that are so bad she cant get out of bed.      So i played with my new phone, talking while charging, texting talking a lot, until i found out that  ou they can give you brain cancer, i stopped immediately using my home portable phone for  hours. Till today even! So anyways about 6 months ago even longer i cannot remember i started seeing stars randomly, like one or 2 of them coming in bright colours not disrupting me but enough to make me scared. I also started getting weird pains in my head, like okay well, do this:      touch the back of your head in the centre, then move your fingers 2 inches to the right,  2 inches up and 1 inch to the left. there, well about there i get thiss pain like a vain or something going deep in there sort of attatched to me eye pull, or feelslike stuff is going there, its weird, throbs for 30 seconds goes away and sometimes comes back. This happened for weeks, then all of the symptoms stopped. Then some time later they started and stopped, all over again. Npw this pain comes rarely , comes like 3 times in a day hurts and stops, and again a few days or wekks, or months later! Its so weird! (sometimes i get ringing or high pitched squeals in my right ear as well but that goes away too, my friend says she gets is also .) i twitch a lot sometimes, in my veins or muscles but doesnt everybody now and again? I told my mo this i told her i might have brain cancer, she said i don't, she said if i did i would have bad headaches, seizures and stuff, and tumoors are rare in kids. I said wha if im different? and she said if i had this for months now and they didnt get worse( stopping actually or decreasing) i probably dont. I told my doctor this all my twitches and weird pains and he said that if i get this anf the pani lasts for only a few seconds and goes away coming casually we dont worry about it. i am a hypochondriac and my mom is sick of hearing such outbursts, so im scared.         You know what, today i faked a big headache, i think ill do this till she gets me an MRI ..She said if i dont have symptoms they wont take me in , they will but in tso long because ppl need MRI's..So what do you think?         ( did have an eating disorder and ate unhealhy as a lack of exersice, and stay on the computer for housr, but when i bettered myself they came, not often but still...i also drink very little water..)

20090309140516AAPhNKy	Health;Diet & Fitness	Could this be related?	My daughter has been having cold hands and seeing specks of green light everywhere all the time (like film grain in a picture only lighted).    We have taken her to see two different optometrists, both have conducted thorough examinations of her eyes (pupil dilations, vision field tests, retinal checks etc.) and neither has found anything abnormal with her eyes, other than the fact that she is very nearsighted (it runs in the family). She frequently has unclear vision and feels faint and dizzy after standing up. She also feels tired much of the time, but it does not impact her very significantly. These only started after she stopped eating meat, around 6 months ago. She is 13. Could this have to do with her not eating meat, and aside from eating meat again, are there any causes (deficiencies etc.) and cures? Her BMI is at the 50% for her age if that helps.

20090309150048AAT8ole	Health;Mental Health	Did I Just Give Up, Am I A *****?	I was a fat unhappy kid in middle school and high school. I hated life, didn't want to go to school but my parents scared me enough that I got good grades and stayed out of trouble. All I did in high school and middle school was study.      I got to college, dropped the fifty pounds in the first few months of college. I struggled with my grades all four years. Probably cause I was so terrified of being fat again I over exercised and under ate. I never partied, drank, or had a girlfriend during college. In the summers all I did was work for my parents at their store. I never had any fun ever, never hung out with friend or partied etc.      My grades sucked all four years. But by my junior year I kicked it into high gear and ended up basically doing my major in one year. I graduated from college with a b average, lost fifty pounds, was in great shape. I would never believe in a million years I would have graduated from college.      I came back home and basically just didn't give a crap for a year and a half. I wanted to be a Marine after I graduated. I no longer was that driven to do that. I basically worked out, did martial arts, partied with friends and that was it.      Do you think the last year and half of doing nothing. Not really a year and half, I work very hard from the spring to the early fall for my parents but I would say a year of no direction in life.

20090309150310AAChNoT	Health;Women's Health	Question about insomnia, and other sleeping problems. it's kinda long, but i'm desperate?	hi everybody. i've had a sleeping problem since i was little. i'm a night owl, which means that i feel at my best at night, i usually don't get sleepy at all, and that's when i feel most awake, so i feel like cleaning, watching tv or reading a book.   when i was a teenager it was alright because i usually would go to bed at 3 or 4 in the morning (that is if i went to bed at all) and i could wake up at whatever time i wanted.   but now that i'm married and have children it's difficult for me because my children wake up early and i only get 2 or 3 hours of sleep so i feel depressed and tired all day.    my doctor said that i should never go to bed when i'm not sleepy because i'll just toss and turn all night, but she also said that i should develop the habit of sleeping at the same time everyday.   but how can i do this if i'm not sleepy at all? should i take sleeping medication? keep in mind i'm breastfeeding.   what would someone with experience on this recommend.   thank you in advance for all your answers

Anyway I sent her a lovely email that morning telling her that I had noticed it and knew we really had been in love and that I was sorry that the love had died perhaps longer ago than we admitted to each other but that it was nice to see pictures of happier times and that it was a great shame it didn't work out and I at last understood her when she said she wished it could go back to the way it was but didn't think it could and so left. Basically trying to let go of the stupid anger around the break up. I told my therapist this and she thought it was a good thing to do?? Anyway. I got a text from ex later in day saying. "Got your email. i'm sorry i really am". I replied later saying "Don't be. Made me glad to remember the real realtionship. Never gonna look back on us as the last few months again now :-) and life could be worse. ******* at work's wife left him for a guy that beat up his kids. He's really gone through it." I got an instant reply "I didn't leave you for someone else. Jesus it never does does it! No doubt I'm some old slag who f******d about on you". I was shocked and sent a long reply explaining my meaning and that I thought the world of her and it would mean a lot if she would tell me she believes that I wasn't slagging her off. No further reply.

20090309142500AANN1S8	Health;Mental Health	How telling your doctor about illegal drug use can backfire?	I've done many illegal drugs in the past trying to self-medicate my ADD symptoms, but now I live a responsible productive life and my family depends on me.      Right now I am seeking medical help and was (finally) diagnosed with ADD at the age of 29.   However, I have serious doubts about openly talking to my doctor about my past drug use - I am afraid this information will be used against me by increased insurance premiums: health, life, possibly even auto. There are a lot of things I can be possibly denied because of that, like citizenship, security clearance, you name it.      I want to tell my doctor about my past so she could help me better, and my condition is deteriorating to the point where I am about to lose my job, but I am trying not to harm myself here, and I have a feeling, that coming out of the closet like that could do me more harm than good.   I am almost certain that telling my doc about this could be like shooting myself in the foot, metaphorically speaking.      To give you a better picture where I am coming from - I have learned all this the hard way after having terrible experience with the law enforcement and other governmental agencies.       I have a bad habit of telling the truth (and too much of it), which constantly gets me in more trouble than anything else in the world.      I am trying to learn from my mistakes, but need a reality check - sometimes I think I'm paranoid, but I know for a fact, that paranoia is not always a bad thing.      Please help me with a piece of advise. I really appreciate it.   And try not to judge me - I am not a freeloader at all, just worried about my family

20090309150043AAUDqJk	Health;Other - Health	Will I fail or pass my urine test? Expert advice needed please?	DoD wants me to resubmit a urine sample. Here's the background story.      Smoked marijuana for a period of about 8 months back last year with a frequency of about twice per week. Quit smoking December 7th so I could confidently pass a urine test for ROTC. Had a urine test late January/early February. Apparently something in it did not jive with DoD because they want me to resubmit a sample. I'm not sure if it was the THC or possibly the tylenol codeine that I am prescribed for headaches. Though I don't know how long opiates take to be metabolized and I am not sure if I took the medication within the time span in which it could be detected before submitting my sample. It could also be from working out...apparently you can't exercise 72 hours before giving a sample because proteins in your body can be detected and force you to resubmit.      Normally I wouldn't be worried about resubmitting a sample but I had a lapse of judgment February 18th and thought I would try smoking weed again. Didn't like it, but I can't go back in time to undo the smoking. In any case I have to give a sample at some point this week, and and I would prefer sooner rather than later. Should I try and postpone and let my body ...metabolize it as time passes? (this would be a desperate maneuver)      I'm 6'1" 145-150lbs, workout consistently three times a week...if that's any factor for helping answer the question. I haven't taken the medication recently, haven't worked out since Saturday...my main concern is the THC metabolites being detected, so if you could mainly address that I would appreciate it.      Thanks

I used to do push ups and they seemed to have worked effectively. I'm 16 and I started this back in 5th grade then I stopped for a long while. I still have some muscle though. Will push ups be more effective than weights? Note: I am not talking about bench lifting, i'm talking about those 35 lb weights that you work on each hand because I already own those and I can't afford the bench weights. Which one is better and more effective? Please explain, thanks.

I've never had any eating disorders but this came up at the dinner table with my family when i said i didn't want to eat. It's not like I'm starving myself, I don't think, because after seeing food and/or other people eating I don't feel hungry anymore. I tried to do various google searches to see if it was some weird phobia i could get rid of but all i got was eating disorder pages.    I literally lose all appetite when i think about eating or food in general and sometimes i feel nauseas. I do eat, i do! i'm actually a very healthy weight, but i can only eat if there are distractions and i'm not thinking about it. Food does still taste good, i love cake and sweets as much as the next 18 year old girl, but the thought of putting it in my mouth and the process of eating it sickens me.   What the heck is this?

I avouid social situations because I get so anxious of my own thoughts I feel as if everyone can feel my anxiety and that makes everything worse. I have silence anxiety as well as social and phone anxiety. I  cant have anyone sleep over cause all my thoughts spiral too fast I cant concentrate. At times I felt people can hear my thoughts but now Im thinking maybe its just anxiety. What is wrong with me? I feel shitty most of the time I feel im always forcing myself to be in a good mood. I think of my problem constantly it never gets a little better thats why I cant think of anything else.

I recently tested negative for genital herpes with both a blood test and a culture swab.The problem is I still have the stinging burning pain and it won`t go away,to make matters worse I just got my period.What should I do?Since I tested negative on both tests does that mean I could still have it or not?Please help me,I am getting stressed out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The doctor I just saw said if there is any sores oozing out I should then go back in and get retested.I have also noticed with this I get a yeast infection right before my period comes and it also flares up around that time,it is also affecting my bladder when I go to the bathroom.I don`t want people to think any less of me if I have genital herpes.I have these bumps that look like zits with clear pus in them,are these considered lesions?I saw a dermatologist before this doctor and she said it looked like I have genital herpes and that she couldn`t give me the test to rule it out,but prescribed me Valtrax ,2 tablets for 10 days,which I took and it seemed to help a little.After,I was done taking Valtrax,that was when I saw the doctor who tested me for this.

20090309160017AA2EucH	Health;Mental Health	Why am I acting this way? I think my depression has come back please help.?	Ok so recently I am not myself at all.   When I speak to my friends I hardly say anything and am just quiet all the time, and there are lots of awkward silences. Its awful, and I feel like they hate me if i don't talk.   When I come home from work (i hate my job) I just feel so low. I go straight to bed.   When my friends want to come round to mine, I get scared cos I know I wont be saying much. I have no idea why this has happened, but its getting me down a lot, I usually talk loads about anything and now im as quiet and shy as a mouse.   I think my depression has come back.   It took a long time to get rid of. My friend of 5years told me the other day how **** of a friend i am, and i think that has slightly brought it back.   I am wanting to go to the docs to get anti deps.   But I just want to be back to how i was, confident, talkative and just me.   Please no harse comments.   Thankyou

I will get a weird feeling in my head, and then a warm sensation from my head, slowly down my back, down my arms, and to my finger tips. Then I will get ringing in my ears. And the warm sensation will be there, actually more hot than warm, and it will have a chill to it.      Sometimes it will even be just on one side and not the other. its quite odd...      can anyone tell me what this maybe?    anyone else experience this?

20090309154504AAaogRs	Health;Diet & Fitness	Serious Weight Loss Question?	I'm a 19yr old female. I weigh 219 lbs and 5'5". I have lost about 6 lbs from my heaviest point. I am joining a gym on Friday, and was wondering about how much weight loss I could expect? I know this is different for everyone, but just a ball-park figure?    I was hoping to loose about 10lbs a month for a couple months, then I know that number would probably drop, since I wouldn't need to loose as much weight as now. Is this an accurate amount? I am planning on doing a lot on the elliptical, and treadmills (walking, and jogging) they also have water aerobics.       Also--- I am unhappy with the midsection on myself (including breasts) They are really large compared to the rest of me. Would this be where the first weight loss would occur?      Thanks for all the answers in advance!

20090309155506AAWGlML	Health;Mental Health	I think I am depressed, should I go to a therapist or wait it out?	I am a 19 year old college student.  Over this semester, I have become less and less social.  Sometimes I agree to go out with people but I always cancel at the last minute.  I have only been out with friends once in three months.  I have always struggled with being as happy as most people, but prior to the past few months, I have successfully used exercise to keep my...head above the water, if you will.  I run 4.5 miles as much as I can, but lately it has not been working.  And half the time I drive all the way to the trail and can't even make myself get out of the car.   My pain has multiplied exponentially over the past two weeks.  I usually never miss class but I have missed four classes in the past few days.  I can't concentrate on homework so I don't do it.  I only get out of bed to eat or go to class.  It takes me forever to complete a simple task.  I take a nap every day, tired or not.  It doesn't feel the same as being sad, because I can't connect these emotions to anything specific, its just an overall hopelessness, and loss of control.   My behavior is becoming more reckless and self-destructive and I feel like I have to get help, or I will stay like this forever.  I am so embarrassed to tell anyone, but my health insurance is still through my parents.  I don't want to hurt them, but I want to get better so I can start enjoying school and my friends and running again.  Do you think this will go away on its own? I hate using medicine to solve problems, but I feel like thats the only thing I can do if exercise is no longer enough.

I'm 38 and had my uterus and right ovary removed about a year and a half ago due to endometriosis, adenomyosis, and chronic large cysts.    I am again having pelvic pain. An ultrasound showed another large cyst on my left ovary. It's also be suggested that I may still have some endometriosis on my bowels and bladder. I have an appointment tomorrow with my ob/gyn and I suspect he'll recommend removing that last ovary. I'm afraid of the hormonal changes though and how it will affect my sex life/drive. My quality of life isn't that great because of the constant pain. But will the removal of that last ovary make things worse???

I am in my first year of college and have decided that there are some bad habits I would like to change. I NEVER drink water. I don't even have one glass a day. Surprisingly my skin is not very dry, but I know eventually it will. I also drink occasionally and that can contribute to skin dehydration. I drink only diet sodas. I know they are bad, but I love caffeine. (Another cause of dehydration.) Is it possible that if I began drinking the recommended eight glasses of water daily I could essentially, have better, younger looking skin when I get older. Also, could the dehydration of my skin cause me to have darker circles under my eyes.      Any advice? Suggestions?

20090309173121AAPU0N4	Health;Mental Health	I need some help, i can't feel anything?	After millions of years i finally started to get help for my 'depression' & 'social anxiety', the doc put me on anti-depressants and has referred me to some counsellor thing etc etc. My first doc's app was on friday but i couldn't open up to him and the whole thing felt awkward and embarrassing and i felt like he thought i was a complete freak who didn't know what she was talking about so the whole thing just frustrated me.   But the most frustrating thing for me right now is that for the last week i've felt nothing whatsoever. I just can't and don't feel anything at all apart from frustration because i feel like i wanna get stuff out but i can't because i can't even cry. Because of this i feel desperate to cut again because i need some kind of release and i NEED to feel something, i don't know what to do about it. I think this is part of the reason why i can't open up to my doc because i don't feel anything so i don't really know what to say. This morning i found scotch in the kitchen and had some, it was the most disgusting thing but it made me feel A LOT better but it didn't last so i don't know what to do. I can't believe how disappointing my doc's app was, i didn't realise it would take so long for this 'help' to actually start working and i just feel like there's no point and to be honest i just feel like i can't even be bothered with ANY of it. Also at the docs it seemed like he didn't wanna help me find out when things started to go wrong, he didn't seem to think it was important but it is for me because i thought i was the happiest kid in the world, nothing bad happened to me i had the best childhood, the biggest and closest family in the world and really amazing friends but there has always been something there and it just escalated so much over the years and i just wanna know why and how.    Anyhoo i just need advice or something because i feel like i'm in pain (inside) but i don't feel any emotion or anything if that makes sense, i NEED to cry or something what should i do? When will i start to feel stuff again?

20090309175048AAkM71T	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Been in Chronic pain for 5 yrs, only 22, suicidal?	My question is, how can 1800-suicide help one who has chronic pain.  Realistically no amount of talking to someone about what I have to live for is going to change anything.  I have been in pain for a long time and finally decided to go to the clinic about it.  Two weeks later after harassing the place, I am still waiting for my X-rays.  He gave me pain meds, but after I looked them up, they would only make my chronic gastritis worse.      You know, no amount of soul searching, looking up how much others are suffering and have it worse than you and that they some how manage to carry on, no matter how fortunate you are to have the best guy out there taking care of you, can really help you once your pain level reaches 7 out of 10.      It gets worse and spreads every year.  I want to seek help through the Vocational Rehabilitation Service so I can find a job that has accommodations for me, I need money, but no one in the medical profession cares.  They sent a psyche chick into my room, who wasn't even a Dr., to guess what mental illness I have and to randomly put me on a drug, Lithium, to lie to me and tell me how safe it is, without even spending the time to evaluate me.  I won't take a random drug, lady, specially if it is going to make me worse.  My Aunt ended up on  dialysis for being pumped up with too many senseless drugs.      I'm not afraid of death, specially if it is in my own hands, because no amount of pain that I can experience in my final moments can compare to the pain I have been living with.  I would like to live for my BF, but not if there isn't anything I can do for the pain, or for my life because of this pain.        I'm just trying to make it through one day at a time.  And today was the day I decided I want to die by filling my bathtub up with water, turning on the toaster, and going out in a blaze of glory.      Anyways, my question is, what can 1800-Suicide do to help me?  Can they get me actually recognized as a patient that needs help??        Is there anything that can help me?      Has anyone in CHRONIC PAIN been through this and has anything helped.  Be specific, because I really don't have much more time.      Pain from: Left knee, both sides of the tailbone, and middle right back.

I still didn't show them, because I didn't think I needed to. But I just saw this one cut while replacing the bandages, & it's pretty big. Too big to call it a cut, too small to call it a gash.

So here's whats going on:   -early 20's, and healthy   -after ANY meal/snack, either instantaniously or max of 15min following, I get quite nausious. Never vomitting, but feel pretty close sometimes.    -nausea lasts at least 3hrs.    -after dinner in the evening is the worst bout, and quite often leads to so much discomfort I have a hard time sleeping.    -diet hasn't changed much:  I have a slightly higher fat intake than I used to (but thats not saying much and that change is over 5 months; I eat fairly low fat)....one thing i have noticed is raw veggies will instantly set me off- that is something that has NEVER happened before, and cooked onions seem to bother me too.

20090309164315AA6LoZA	Health;Diet & Fitness	Diet help/advice por favor!?	Ok so I'm not fat, but I am a little overweight. I need to loose a good twenty pounds to be in the norm, and I need a lot of help. I'm a HUGE procrastinator, and I'm always promising myself to work out tomorrow, or watch what I eat starting tomorrow. So I need a little help. For those of yous who actually lost the weight you wanted to loose, could you help me? What helped you to keep going on and working out. And what workouts worked the best for you? Because when I do work out I feel bored and uninterested in finishing, so I end up quitting and never starting again. So the help from you would be very appreciated.

For the past month and half I have had very bad lower back pain. If I do sleep I have to sit nearly strait up with my back strait. If I do lay down, it doesn't matter if its a firm or soft bed, I will have so much pain it's nearly unbearable. I've been to the emergency room. They just gave me hydrocordone but it only masks the pain just a little bit and doesn't seem to help. When I went back to my regular doc he just gave me large refills of the same drug, and he gave me a shot of a stronger anti-inflamatory drug. He told me to continue with the ibuprofren also using a heating pad and icing. Not getting any better. Oh yeah- my x-rays showed that my spine spacings were strait and even. I think it's muscle pain and didn't know if anyone has had this problem too. Please help!!!!!

20090309175852AAYg8J4	Health;Other - Health	Um, Could I possibly have bulimia?	Okay, this has been on my mind for quite awhile, so I'd really like an answer. So, for the last 4-6 months i haven't sat done for a decent meal(that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.) And finally last night I sat down with my family and ate. I went back for thirds after my seconds. The results: I was still hungry, but if I ate anymore i thought I'd puke. So I'm getting antsy about my eating habits. Sometimes I wake up full without having eaten anything the night before. Then the other day I went to pig out on anything i could get my hands on. sometimes for the whole day I eat just junk, sometimes I only drink water. And when I eat and the food settles in, my throat burns, like maybe I have to vomit. my stomach is unusually uneasy(i have a tough stomach!) and it is not unusual to me after six months of this that i feel like throwing up all the time. But, the thing is that's one thing I hate having to do the most, throw up. So I try my hardest to calm my stomach, I usually sleep it off, but the feeling is still there. I know it's not a tummy-bug because it's been going on for half a year now. And the funny thing is, not matter how much I eat I never seem to gain an ounce(I know I have a fast metabolism, but it could mean something more) Please, no stupid answers, I'd really like to cure this if its cure-able.

If to lose a pound, you have to burn 3,500 calories more than you intake, he's right, why not just be anorexic lol? I mean, obviously it's not healthy as far as LIVING goes, but as far as losing weight, wth! I mean, do you have any idea how hard it is to lose 3,500 cals? I go to the gym and work out, hard, for about an hour, and only lose, (estimate) about four hundred or so.And, I don't eat an extremely high calorie diet.I do that to be healthy, but I NEVER lose any weight.I'm amazed that anybody does lol.So, honestly, on a diet that consists of about 1200 calories, do you have to work hard all the time just to lose about a pound a week?   No wonder there are so many anorexic people out there.

Have you ever heard the saying: eat breakfast like a king, eat lunch like a prince, and eat dinner like a pauper?      Well.. I am trying to apply that saying to my eating regimen.      What do you think about eating only fruits and vegetables (serving size each) for dinner each day? I mean some days will have exceptions--like if I was going out with a friend somewhere, etc..but for the most part, each day would be just fruit and veggies for dinner.       You may think I will get bored with this..which may be true. However, I think we can train our bodies to do anything really--even become used to what we eat and when. For instance, I would never choose to eat meat/fish/pasta, etc in the morning--no matter how little the amount. I am assuming this is because I am just not used to doing that.

20090309124723AANKnUN	Health;Mental Health	Is there such a thing as being misdiagnosed with panic attacks, could it be something else?	I had two separate fainting spells at work over a month ago. I didn't actually faint, but I felt like I was going to. I was cold, and felt really sick. I went to see an MD, and he did some blood tests and an EKG. He felt very strongly that I was having panic attacks. I immediately felt better, however started to fear having more of them since it happened so randomly the first time. One month later, I was hiking and started to feel faint and dizzy. I went to the ER. They took my vitals and said this was a panic attack. I am so frightened to do anything now. I need help, and will see my MD on Wednesday for a referrals to a psychiatrist. I am just wondering if anyone has ever been given the misdiagnosis of a panic attack. In other words, could I be having a seizure or something physically wrong with me. Each time I have had one of these episodes, I feel like I am going to die. I have the following symptoms: chills, feeling like I am really fainting, dizziness, heart pounds, can't catch my breath, slight headache, the back of my head tingles. I am a 33 year old female. I really want these episodes to stop. Might I be having something else? Thanks.

20090309134931AAxqb0S	Health;Women's Health	What shape is your cervix and is it easily located? Possibly TMI, but please help.?	Internet pictures always show the cervix as this donut shaped blob that is perfectly round and sitting nicely against the wall of the vagina. I just wondered if there are variations of the 'normal' cervix, because mine feels longer, almost like the end of a beer bottle or something almost cylindrical in shape. It is maybe 2-3 cm in length?      Also, many people I have found, can't reach their cervix with their finger. If I am laying down, I can reach mine with the tip of my index finger. Other times it is closer.       Please could you let me know is this is normal. I promise I am not a man or someone wanting this information for sick reasons, I just want to know if all is normal down there. I'm 24 and due to have my first smear in three months.      Many thanks,

20090309141542AAxO4mf	Health;Diet & Fitness	Please help me!! Question about loosing weight.?	Hi,     My names Elvi and Im using my aunts account. I am 18 and in my first year of university. I am 5'3 and a 170 pounds which means that I am overweight. I really want to loose weight but nothing is working. I am getting really upset..not going to starve myself tho. On saturday I got my determination back and wanted to try again. I was getting fed up of hating my body. So, I decided to cut back on my food...this is what I am eating everyday since saturday      Breakfast - Cereal....usually wetabix.    Lunch- Go to good court....small meal...no pasta, bread.    Tea- Orange and a yogurt( 160 cal kind)   OR   Lunch - Yogurt and Orange   Tea- Go to food court.     -- I cut out everything else      I exercised on Saturday and burned 600 calories and I was planning on going on tomorrow. I was thinking I might try adding in walks.       I know that starving yourself does not work as you body stores what you eat and if you started eating more, you would gain weight. Do you think I am not eating enough. I do feel some hunger pangs...not much though.       I did only start this on saturday.       Am I doing enough? Anything else I should do?    Thankyou for any advice   Elvi :)

Infarinx hexa (for diptheria, tetanus ,whoofing cough, polio, hepatitis B and Hib) was given at 2 and 4 months. It could have been repeated at 6 months but the one that has been given was infarinx IPV ( whidoes contain antegens for diptheria, tetanus, wohoofing cough and polio.) There is a vaccine called comvax which contains antigens for hepatitis B and Hib, and would it be still effective if I give it to her, so that it covers what has been missed out at 6 months?      My poor baby, when i realised doctor has messeed up with vaccines I went there to clarify it, he just slips away from the problem saying correct vaccine was given, it was written in the book incorrectly. How on the earth I would take his word and do nothing when he hasn't even entered a batch number of the vaccine so I got no way  to check it out with medicare?         Pls help me guys I am so helpless.
