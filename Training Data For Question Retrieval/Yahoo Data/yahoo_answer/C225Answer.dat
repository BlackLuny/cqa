I know half the people in these forums probably do that and are now hating me, but I'm just sayin'...     there's actually an interesting statistical study in the book "Freakonomics" that illustrates the correlation between education, race, socioeconomic level, etc. and how we choose the spelling of our baby names....

A really idiotic name.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	How is it pronounced?  Cad-lee or cade-lee?

Teachers and sports instructors could have a hard time trying to pronounce it. Maybe spell it Caydlee, Caydley, Kaydlee, or Kaydley instead? I think it's cute and I've never heard of it before.

Try doing some spine curls (Stand up, gently curl down to reach your toes and then curl back up so your standing up straight) it'll help relieve the tension in your stomach muscles.    Also Sun Salutations are good, here's how to do them - http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=yuvfHTaftL... (sorry the woman is so annoying!)    Have a little walk around, it'll hurt at first to stand up straight but if you just gently warm up and move around it does help.
j2mRop0laa	We lived together about a year and a half. I think it prepared us for marriage, a little. Although, we were married 2 years before we even had a disagreement. I think it can go either way.    Oh, we got engaged about 4 months after living together.|`|YnLqItJPaa	My husband and I lived together for a couple of years before we were married, and probably for a year before we were engaged.    For myself, I felt it was important to make sure that living together wasn't going to change the dynamic of our relationship, or, if it did change the dynamic, that it would do so in a way that we could handle and work with.  For us, it was definitely the right move.  We were able to deal with the logistical stuff early on and then focus on our relationship.  And now, we've found we're a great team and love living together.    We've been a couple for over six years now, probably lived together three or so, and we've been married since Oct 07.  And now we have a wee one on the way!|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I met my Husband in 1998. We moved in together after 6 months. In 2001 I got pregnant. We were together for 4 years at that time. He was to chicken to propose but me getting pregnant put it more in perspective. We did not marry because I was pregnant but because we loved each other and it was the right time. In 2002, 7 months pregnant we were married by the Justice of Peace.    I believe our marriage is stronger. We got to know one another. It has been 6 years married. 10 years together. And I love him more and more each day.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	We were living together for a little over 2 years when he proposed. We lived together for almost 4 years before got married. We also had a 2.5 year old & I was 3 months pregnant (at the time we got married). I think our relationship s very strong for living together that long, at least we knew that we could tolerate each other! LoL.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	We lived together for almost 3 years before we got married.  We got engaged after about 2 years of cohabiting.  We were young when we moved in together.  We bought our house together the month before we got married and it was officially ours two days before the wedding.  Im not sure if it is stronger or weaker.  i know that we knew each other.  We spent so much time together.  One of the few areas my husband and I hardly ever argue about it the kids and I believe that is because we have talked about kids since almost day 1.  We used to have "arguments" over our pretend children before we ever had real ones.  I think that is one of the best things we ever did.|`|fC1HUgAAaa	We moved in together in june 2006, we were married in May of 2008 so almost 2 years. We got engaged after we moved in together. We had a baby in Dec 2007. I think it works better just because you can see the other persons annoying habits and decide either I CAN or I CANNOT live with this person forever. We waited to get married because we wanted everyone to know it wasn't because of the baby, it was because we love each other dearly. We have been married 8 months and I am 4 months pregnant with our second child! :)|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	7 years, conceived 4 Sons in those years before we decided to marry. Got married December 25th 2007.    Our relationship hasn't changed at all. it truly is only an expensive piece of paper. It did however make our Guardianship/Adoption process easier, being married.  We moved in together when I was 18, and had William & Tobias when I was 21.  Why did we wait? Because I don't believe marriage is important. I was pregnant with Ryan & Cody and Andrew asked me to marry him, and in my moment of insanity I said yes.  BUT we had to have the Wedding my way. So on Christmas Day with our closest family and friends we surprised them with a wedding.  Andrew asked me many times before, but I always said no. Mean I know, but I have my reasons.    We were already devoted to each other till our time passed, so it wasn't anything major.|`|kbdkOPHDaa	LOL cute question. im still not married. we both really want to be but we are very busy, since we have 2 children together and im a stay at home mom and so bills and the children are more important than a wedding right? and we want a wedding not anything too expensive but i dont just want to go in front of a judge.    anyways we have been together about 5 years, engaged for one. we are pretty young still i just turned 22 and hes turning 24.....|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	We met May of 2006, moved in together March of 2007, and got married January 26, 2008. My husband and I lived together for 10 months before we got married. We were engaged for only about 4 or 5 months before we finally said I do. Our relationship is very strong and we're madly in love with each other. We've only been married for about a year though and have an 11 month old and I'm 33 weeks pregnant with  2. We knew we wanted to be together so there was really no point of waiting any longer. =)    We're both 23...I'll be 24 in September and him in October.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	We tried living together for one year.  I was still in college and we'd always stay at each other's places so we figured living together would be the same thing and save us money.  Wrong.  We ended up going back to seperate residences for a few more years before getting married.  I think mostly it was me with the problem...I just wasn't ready to "share my space."      We were engaged for at least a year before we tried living together and got married about 2 years after that experiment.  We've been married for over 3 years and everything is great.  I really can't say if it effected the relationship one way or another.  We're doing great now...so obviously it didn't hurt us too much!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	We started to go out in August, I moved in after Christmas. We decided to get married a few months later and we did in June. We will celebrate our 16th anniversary in June this year. I don't think living together or not would have made us closer, we would have been either way.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	My husband and I were best friends for awhile and then it grew to more and we couldnt get enough of each other so we moved in together, we lived together for about  6 months and decided to get married, we wernt "technically engaged" we just knew we both wanted to be with each other forever and went to the courthouse to get married  we didnt need to spend all that money when it wasnt important to go "all out" on a ceremony. afterwards we went and got professional pictures taken, and took 2 weeks of work off  and went home and never left the house or should i say bed..LOL it was great, we plan to renew our vows at our 5 year wedding anniversary and throw a reception (which is next year)  and maybe go on a cruise somewhere nice :) but this time we will have more fun because we have a daughter thats 1 year and the light of our lives!|`|NysFTExhaa	Wow, looking at other people's answers I feel like the odd one out.    We were dating and got engaged before we moved in together.  A month before the wedding I moved out of my apartment and we moved into a house together.  It was an adjustment for us living together but we never argued over anything or how the other person did something.  We waited mostly because he was going to school in another state and I was waiting for my time in my apartment to be up.  We've been married for two years.|`|kbZvBLQUaa	i lived with my husband for 3 years and we talked about what we wanted for our wedding but never got engaged or anything we also believe that it is just a piece of paper until he got health insurance and wanted to put me on his policy he said we have to get married make it happen and a week later we rented a suite at a hotel on the beach and we had a friend who's daughter was a notary so she married us on the 5th floor balcony overlooking the ocean in south florida it was nice and simple just how we liked it only had 5 friends there and then when it was over we went down to the tiki bar and got drunk and spent 3 days in the hotel for our honeymoon it was nice since we live in florida its easy to do that and its also nice because we go to the tiki bar every once in a while and remember our very simple wedding, we will be celebrating out 2 anniversary in may and we have a little girl to celebrate also she will be 1 in april|`|6Ak0kDtKaa	yes- 2years before. We got engaged a year after moving in. Sure the relationship is stronger (with time it can only get stronger or weaker). We didnt wait becuase we loved each other.     we are now married and have a kid so it worked out. i think its good too live together, know what your geting into before marriage.|`|8e5bIYjJaa	My partner and I are getting married in June of this year (so exciting!). About time seeing as we've been engaged for 4 years!    We moved in together two weeks after meeting (nothing untoward, just as friends solving a renting issue), lived together for a month before we admitted we had feelings for each other and have been together ever since...going on 7 years this October.     Wow...time flies. We have the usual up and downs of every relationship and we haven't married sooner as we always wanted to do other things first...like buy our own home, travel, etc and didn't have the money to do both.    Then at our 5 year mark we had some serious relationship issues which we needed to work through together, it's made us stronger and re-enforced the love and respect we have for each other. That's why we have set the date! We now can't think of anything more important than sealing our love.|`|mpc6aNvCaa	i knew my husband in hs we were friends but after hs still friends i had a son not his but remained friends we moved in together and got married 6 months later and 2 younger ones, we will be married for almost 12yrs and going strong. i will tell u this a teacher told us marriage gets better every year and the intimacy part does too. which for us it's very true, paper or no paper do what u and your other half is right for u. good luck.|`|UUpsa35Daa	My boyfriend and i have been living together for a year but don't plan on getting engaged for a year and a half and then don't plan on getting married until i'm half way through college.    We're only 17 and 19. I moved out of my house at 16, with my mom's permission and my boyfriend and i moved in together. We fully support ourselves and we want to get married. But the reason we're not getting married for a while... Well, partially just because we want to keep enjoying just being together. And i know people say "well if you know you're getting married, why wait after you turn 18?" and asking ourselves "what's the point of waiting?" isn't a reason for us to get married. We know we're going to, we're just not in a rush to do it.  We love where we're at right now, in this moment and that's all that matters.    Another reason is that it's partially out of respect for my mom. All the while growing up she told my sister and i not to get married until after college...i'm making my own compromise.    They day we get engaged and they day we get married will be two of the happiest days of my life...but i'm not going to rush getting to those days. I'm going to enjoy what i have now as much as i possibly can.
mcywqcHuaa	well, my first time, i was scared that i wouldn't last long, because when i "take care of myself", it only takes about 5-6 minutes for me to be finished. my first time didn't last long because her dog kept barking, so i had to leave. the next day, we went to my house to have sex. i lasted an hour, and somehow it felt better than if i was doing it myself. every nerve tingled as i slid in and out. it was really about the sounds she made and how her skin felt.     usually, when i finish, i can feel it coming. during sex, it kind of snuck up on me. when i pulled out,  i immediately started going. it was the bes time that's happened, even with me doing it to myself.    i'm interested on your perspective. email me? reisenauerseth@yahoo.com.    send me one through the regular email. i don't know how to work the answer page email.|`|vTalY5Skaa	It feels like sticking your finger into a bowl of whipped cream!|`|pMTTHWqDaa	it feels good!!
2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i heard in places without medical care it is like 1 in 100 .   how much does that hurt do u mean dying from pain ? Unlikely adn yes it does hurt|`|jNgh3e3Faa	It depends. If you are under 18 and unattached, it is horribly painful.  (I am kidding)  If you are older, it is not bad at all. That is why some women keep having babies.   Supposedly some women can orgasm from vaginal delivery.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey im so sorry to hear of your loss x  After a miscarriage/birth your cycles can change it just depends on your body.  I sadly lost my baby, stillborn 12th December 08, and i bled for 2 weeks and i know i've ovulated because i used opk's and my midwife did also say alot of woman ovulate before there period.  I have no sign of a period just yet, so keeping my fingers crossed but not keeping my hopes up just in case its still my body getting back to normal.  It's not too early to start trying, i know people say things like this but my midwife said we can start trying again when we really feel ready and we know its what we want.    Yes you are likely to fall pregnant, as you are very fertile for the next 6 months or so.  Best of luck and lots of baby dust for you xx|`|8y0837nlaa	i had a d&c on November 8 at 10 weeks.  i got my period Dec 23 (45 days later) to this day i still havent seen my period so i took a HPT came out Negative. Usually i would feel when i ovulated all the time.  This month i didnt notice anything.  So i think i didnt ovulate.  Hope my cycles get back to normal then in couple of months will try again.
QoPz3dw6aa	Take for example your relationship is a plate and each time you and your boyfriend break up, a piece breaks off the plate and no matter how much you try to glue that plate back together, it will never be the same.|`|008354b191539f7ee286116095a7f8c1aa	Well it depends on the what happened and how the Xes are Xed.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	theres a reason his an ex. i would never get back with an ex. if i wanted to be with him, we wouldnt have broken up.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Personally?

The only reason for this if that he never cheated on me, however I don't recommend it to anybody.  If I  had to do it again, I would never do it.  Me and my ex are good friend now and it work fine (but only friend.)  You can go back with you ex if you both have therapy and can see that this person is a different person.  Also it depend what was the cause for the break up.  If he was a cheater,  I would never take him back not even with therapy.    The others ex- boyfriends, I could hang a big stone in their neck and drop them in the Hudson River so they would not be able to float and freeze their ball.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Goodness no! Even if I was available again, no way would I go back to any of my exes. There is a reason they are ex. Always remember that!
413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	ok first of all calm down.. and yes what you did is stupid. but you made a mistake. next time use protection if your not ready to have a child. teachers and schools don't go through all that trouble to tell teens not to have sex without protection, because they know what their talking about...     pre *** is fluid that comes out before a man ejacluates and it clears the way out for the sperm to come out. so pre *** can get sperm from the last time you ejacluated. so its a possibly she could be pregnant. but also there are a lot of couples that use the pull out method and never got pregnant. me and my fiance use it and we have been doing it over a year now and we haven't gotten pregnant but every woman is different...    so next time use protection if your not ready for a family and make sure she gets a test.     and good luck!|`|SnanuNKiaa	yes. she could be. PRE-*** still has SPERM in it!!!! it only takes ONE sperm to fertilize an egg!!!    and even if you didn't feel anything come out, doesn't mean something didn't! Next time use protection!!!|`|wqOTgbxmaa	USE PROTECTION IF YOU AINT READY FOR A BABY AND YES THERE IS A CHANCE BECAUSE OF PRE *** AND IT SHE WAS OVULATING THEN SHE MITE BE GOOD LUCK :]|`|lzUF22l0aa	sorry but there always is a possibilty so i would deffintly tell her to keep an eye on her period to make sure it comes. Be more carefull next time ...good luck|`|oXG1GOPcaa	its ok i know she will be surprised
Coc593Ikaa	NOW! Ideally, you would have been taking them before conception. Folic acid is most important in the first few weeks.    Go to your local store (drug, big box or grocery) and pick up some "prenatal vitamins". The generic brand will work just fine!    Congrats and good luck!|`|DNygQdmVaa	start now  and congrats.|`|SnanuNKiaa	start taking prenatal, and cut out all bad habits now. the physical development of your child (organs, eyes, brains, the essentials) is happening now.|`|8YhITQ7laa	take prenatal pills and 2 mg of folic acid. Even if you aren't pregnant then you can still take the prenatal pills (as vitamins and minerals for yourself)|`|SzxOQHRvaa	Hi,    If you have missed youre period I would start taking the prenatal pills just to be on the safe side. They can't hurt you in any way and it is very important for you to take them if you are pregnant. I would start taking them and make sure you go see the doctor and have a pregnancy test done. Good luck to you!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	yeah you should be taking folic acid at least, even if you turn up not pregnant the extra vitamins wont hurt you. It's never too early to start taking your prenatals in fact most doctors recommend starting them when you are trying to conceive.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	You take pre-natals. Don't do anything you're not supposed to and write out all your questions for the doctor so you don't forget... no matter how miniscule or stupid you think they are.
js5zxWCqaa	This is called PUBERTY.  Talk to him about it and let him know that his body will be changing and how and while your at it, he's old enough to talk to about sex and relationships but it may be a bit much all at once but it wouldn't hurt to bring up these things, he's gonna hear and experience them anyhow.  You should never be afraid to talk to your own son about these things.  For some it may be uncomfortable but it shouldn't be, it's all totally normal.   My sons never had thier father around to talk to them about it so I did and after the 1st talk the others were no problem.  I'm sure as a mother you wouldn't want him getting the info elsewhere or it could very well be the wrong info.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Hes almost a teenage boy what do u expect its normal.    OR... He has the hots for his mom|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	he s    normal|`|z5hzyDZgaa	at this age is probably feeling somethings down there that he never has before. he might notice that it feels good to touch it a certain way and he doesnt know that its a private matter. so maybe sit down with him and explain to him that those are your private parts and you dont talk about them outside of the home, just to make sure he isnt saying these thigns to others. and make sure that he knows it is okay to ask you questions but that touching himself is something he must do when he is alone. DO NOT make him feel like there is something wrong with him, everyone goes through this and he needs to know that you are there if he doesnt understand something. he might even start learning about it in school and doesnt know how to ask others. just be there for him adn no there is nothing wrong with him.|`|xBW4saqgaa	yes you should ask him to stop speaking all this, try changing the topic and secondly he cud be very innocent and does not know a thing so get to understand him better.|`|Vy7AbWg7aa	this is not his or your fault his age comin to teen age where they start to feel there hormones change he is going through a change. may good advice u might ask your trust worthy family doctor. donot force him away may just avoid ask him to do it him self u r busy. may check his tv or net viewing without interfering his privacy.|`|ANZWru1Laa	Sounds like puberty. He needs to discuss this with you and he doesn't know how, but he is starting to feel different. You need to address this or refer it to someone you trust, but don't ignore him, he's reaching out to you. If his father isn't around, or cannot discuss this then there is always a doctor, trusted male family member he respects, etc. As a father of 3 boys ages 18, 9 & 9, I get questions like this all the time, but as a dad, I don't mind. My dad never spoke about anything regarding sex and the one time I tried to ask he became so uncomfortable I told him never mind, and turned to friends. Don't do this to him, it makes puberty more confusing than it needs to be. He is approaching you as a child because that is the only way he knows how, by trying to show you whats wrong. Look at it from his perspective: "I have this thing that is on my body that I use everyday, and now it gets hard by itself and feels sensitive, I think there is something wrong with me!" " I better show mom". Talk to him and ease his mind, he's looking for an explanation, and he deserves an honest explanation. There is no way to divert his attention from this, his hormones are coming into play now. Masturbation, wet dreams, erections and all of those "uncomfortable" subjects are all kind of scary when they first happen to you around that age. You have never felt feelings like that before, remember? Be his rock to lean on and his guidance to raise a good man.|`|WBpanY8Kaa	your son is probably no doubt going through puberty.  Explain this to him and ask him why is he doing this|`|LtDeqTNiaa	I would say, explain him about the difference of boy and man.  And for immediate relief just put some power and ask him not to touch his parts at all. As he is obedient to you he should listen to that.|`|Tgt3cRF7aa	he is through puberty and experiencing some new things be cool its normal. but the next time he does it explain to him that he is now becoming a man and he is no longer going to be  a boy  (also it can be his peers or he is seeing porn movies)|`|FIQH3j4Aaa	Have him talk to your husband divert him from even talking to you about this.|`|Xl45llTTaa	he want to do sex so he is telling like, first do him then ask how he is
ZlNFOgO7aa	Aaaahhhh that is my worst nightmare, but my eldest is a girl, so it may freak her out, but she wont be wiggling Mr happy about it, lol    My 2yo has been around while I have been, ahem toileting and had to remove a pad after having my baby and he got distressed, so I said "look there's a purple flying elephant, with a pink hippo behind him" and shut the door, lol    You will probably have to ask more questions from your son about this "birds and bees" stuff while he mulls it over. I bet he is still thinking about it every now and again but needs to process it. I don't envy you hun, lol. Good luck.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Of course he's thinking about you when he masterblaths, aren't most of us on here?    Lardy, baby, sometimes you're too much!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My 5yr old has walked in on my a few times changing a tampon...i just told him girls get a period and left it at that. Now he knows what tampons are for etc and i didnt have to go into a big long story about anything...just kept it short and simple and that was good enough for him.|`|SiomJ10Saa	Judging by your screen name. it can't bother you that much what your 4 yr old thinks of his mother|`|76255ecc584cd1006f1116e750d7ba6eaa	It happened to me with my daughter when she was young,with a pad,not tampon. Then she started to use my pads for every little boo-boo she got! lol|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Thankfully no, but one time my dog chewed up my bloody pad she found in the garbage.|`|axylPYftaa	ooooohhhh.... *drools|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Oh my gosh I can soooo relate!! The same thing happened to me once, except it was my dad. And instead of wiggling his Mr Happy he shot a load in my face.|`|TK03jZTuaa	You just give simple explanations that are age appropriate. But any age child needs to know that Mr. Happy is called a penis.|`|hiRYCT2Haa	Your son calling his penis Mr. Happy will have much more psychological effects than seeing you with a tampon.|`|FqRb2drmaa	If he thinks his PENIS is called mr.happy i would think whoever taught him that should go to a psychiatrist
kpi69PHWaa	He probably finally got some sense, realized how ineffective that "birth control" is. Using the pull-out method is a great way to get pregnant. Why in the world aren't you using actual birth control? Condoms and the pill are not at all hard to get ahold of. Not to mention a LOT less inconvenient/expensive/whatever your other excuses for not using them are.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Maybe he knows that he didn't use that 'method' correctly... Not that there is a correct way to use that method. I reckon he may have accidently what a pork chop|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I think the better question is why are you having unprotected sex? In answer to your question, you need to go with your gut, you are probably 100% about what you suspect his fears are about. Confront him.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	Why dont you ask him, we cant possibly know why he is asking you this|`|JLQMyKCvaa	he came in u a little|`|vYAfNGmfaa	Well this happened to my sister. Her boyfriend was 16 and she was 14. One day he just looked at her and was like, "are you pregnant?" and even though my sister said no he didn't believe her. After 2 weeks he made her take a test and guess what she WAS pregnant.     Men always know. You need to take a test if your period is due and then go get on BC pills.|`|CclZtstJaa	Well it could be that his worry has finally overridden his lust. He was having a good time with you and didn't care about it, but now it's catching up with him.    Make him start wearing condoms, OK? Or go get some birth control pills. Your parents never have to find out if you're worried about that. There's all sorts of birth control methods at drug stores too like spermacide that you can buy without a prescription.     Just use birth control, OK?
7B2s7maWaa	Otep-No  Shania-No  Ocean-Yes (well maybe a middle name)  Apple-No  Rainbow-No  Senator-No  Celine Yes|`|AA11966821	Celine is a pretty name and very French.  Shania is overworked and tedious.  The rest are garbage.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	None of them except Celine. The others are no good.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Actually my daughter's middle name is going to be Celine. But not after Celine Dion, after the writer Louis-Ferdinand Cline. The rest of the names I wouldn't consider. I'm not a celebrity, so I couldn't get away with it...lol :)|`|YqdU6SS6aa	No. I would not name my child any of them.|`|3BoZZZajaa	Celine is the only one I could even consider.|`|UCkkrhdhaa	Otep- No  Shania- Possibly as a middle name  Ocean- No  Apple- No  Rainbow- NO  Senator- NO  Celine- Again, possibly as a middle name|`|Ddb5821Jaa	none|`|wziUVyVoaa	Otep - no. It reminds me of The Mummy. It may be okay for some, but not for me.    Shania - no. It reminds me of Shania Twain, and I wouldn't want my child to grow up with everyone teasing her about it.    Ocean - yes. I think it's beautiful. I doubt my husband would ever go for it, but If I could talk him into it, I'd love that name.    Apple - yes. It's kinda been labeled as a celebrity baby name, but I've always loved it. It automatically makes you think happy thoughts when you hear it.    Rainbow - maybe. I'd have to put a lot of thought into it. I would probably put it as a secondary name (whether first or middle) and use the other name as the primary name.    Senator - definitely not. I don't know if I even need to explain that one =/.    Celine - no. Once again, it reminds me (and probably many others) of a singer (Celine Dion).|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Ocean is the only one i may consider|`|2xEkFFvaaa	Otep no  Shania maybe  Ocean no   Apple maybe  Rainbow no  Senator no   Celine no    these are all pretty lame no offence.. not very creatiive?|`|KkFKdRG8aa	Ocean and Celine sound nice, and maybe Shania, but the rest are abnormal.|`|Xq7MFmgcaa	Otep-No  Shania-Maybe  Ocean-No  Apple-Could see it  Rainbow-No  Senator-No  Celine-Maybe|`|oYzXuu4haa	Ocean is pretty|`|XYvOg5Juaa	Have you thought of a possibilty that names like OTEP AND SHANIA would have a meaning in a different language which may be beautiful.  Anyways, this is my opinion:    Otep - Sounds wierd  Shania - Thats a nice name but prefer the name Sanaya  Ocean - Nope  Apple - Never  Rainbow - Nope  Senator - Lol..no  Celine - Why not|`|2l636NUvaa	Otep - No  Shania - Yes  Ocean - Yes (Middle name though)  Apple - No  Rainbow - No  Senator - No  Celine - Yes    I'm not saying that I would really name a kid any of those names, I just mean in general, its not a bad name.|`|3XaREbrQaa	Otep - no  Shania - no  Ocean - yes  Apple - no  Rainbow - hell no   Senator - no  Celine - sure|`|AA12159065	Otep - no  Shania - no  Ocean - no  Apple - no  Rainbow - no  Senator - no  Celine - yes    they are really pretty, i just don't perfer those names|`|uI4WPwhsaa	nup.|`|E8kzNG3iaa	Otep - no  Shania -  no  Ocean - yes, as a middle name  Apple - no  Rainbow - no  Senator - no  Celine - yes|`|AA10698787	Otep No  Shania No, only because people would immediately think of Shania Twain.  Ocean No  Apple No  Rainbow No  Senator Um.. .no?  Celine Yes|`|ElizPQGUaa	Otep- no.  Shania- msybe.  Ocean- yes.  Apple- yes.  Rainbow- no.  Senator- maybe.

Shania = Too famous of a name.    Ocean = I know where that is hehe....not on my kids b.c.    Apple = How odd to have to take the Apple to the doctors.    Rainbow = How ridiculous can someone be to name a kid that.    Senator = Okay okay.....this is a joke right?    Celine = This is the only normal name on this list......but not what I would choose.|`|4qNYNG41aa	Well no, and this is the reason why.  I am sure OTEP is a type of Ear Wipes for dogs.  SHANIA is a typical unemployed,benefit cheat,house wifes choice of name, because she thinks the black community will except her as afro caribbean if she gives her mixed race baby a name like SHANIA,  porchia,chandelier,mercedes, ect.  OCEAN is just stupid, and rhymes with Potion.  APPLE is a fruit, it is as silly has Pear or Orange.  RAINBOW seems to conjure up images of gay pride, I am bi by the way.  SENATOR is just odd.  And CELINE is the name of a poker faced,human skeleton from Canada,who used to have black,crooked teeth and facial hair on her forehead.  No offense to your friends.|`|Elxuvon8aa	No I would not use any of them|`|ej51eWO7aa	Otep-NEVER in a million years  Shania-maybe but idk how 2 pronounce it...shania twain???  Ocean-NO  Apple-gwen paltrow's daughter  & no  Rainbow- NO  Senator-NO  Celine- no...like celine dion????|`|sOgLLlDraa	I wouldn't but I don't think anything is wrong with Celine or Shania...I mean I know they are singers but they are still somewhta common names from the past decade. It's not like Madonna or Elvis.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Otep - Maybe, but it would depend on the child.  Shania - No.  Ocean - Yes.  Apple - No.  Rainbow - Only if it's a girl I would be naming this.  Senator - Maybe as a middle name.  Celine - No.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	Otep - no  Shania - yes  Ocean - no  Apple - no  Rainbow - no  Senator - no  Celine - yes|`|AA12109238	nope.. its original and all but not my taste of name to give my child|`|87WOSjwgaa	That is a no to all of them!|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Otep - No  Shania - No  Ocean - ... No  Apple - No  Rainbow - No way.  Senator - NO  Celine - Sounds like an old person name. No.    None..
wziUVyVoaa	Joel - I think it is a tad overused, but still a nice name. Possible middle name - Joel Parker.    Jayden - BEAUTIFUL. I love it. You don't hear it often and I love the way you have it spelled. Possible middle name - Jayden Bronx.    Ty - Once again, I love it. But I think it's better as a middle name (such as Gavin Ty, Caden Ty, etc.) Possible middle name - Ty Cooper.    Seth - It's another one that's a little overused, but it's not a bad name at all. I still like it. Possible middle name - Seth Justin.    Cayden - I looooove the spelling. My best friend has a son named Caden and every time we go out somewhere and tell someone his name, they all react with the same expression - "what a wonderful name!" Possible middle name - Cayden Brett.    Hayden - I tried to talk my husband into this name forever. I figured he'd go for it, considering he's a star wars freak haha. I was heart broken when I couldn't talk him into it! I still think it's an adorable name, though. Possible middle name - Hayden Gunner.    Brody - It might remind a lot of people of The Hills or whatever, but I think it's adorable. It's unique and suitable. Possible middle name - Brody Heath.    Juliette - While it's a beautiful name, I think that she could get teased a lot in school (Romeo & Juliet). Possible middle name - Juliette Ryan.    Blake - I ADORE the name Blake for a girl. It's beautiful. Possible middle name - Blake Piper.    Gwendolyn - It kinda reminds me of Sleeping Beauty, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a little old-fashioned for my taste, but not a bad name. Possible middle name - Gwendolyn Miana (pronounced MY-ANN-UH).    Blair - It reminds me of Golden Girls and Facts of Life at the same time, but I still love it for some reason. No one uses it for anything but a middle or last name anymore. I think it's a winner. Possible middle name - Blair Ryan.    Clementine - That's my old cat's name, haha, but I like it no matter what anyone says. It makes me thing of bright, beautiful colors. It's a beautiful name. Possible middle name - Clementine Peyton.|`|Elxuvon8aa	well I like Joel and Seth  I am really begining to hate Den names just because they are all over used I like Juliette and Gwendolyn|`|sOgLLlDraa	I like all the boy names.

BpCsSvKvaa	go see a gynecologist|`|sKmQVwQMaa	see a gyno.|`|HOdblqIkaa	your dr will be the one to determine what pill you should be on by what your reason for wanting to be on BC is. if you have a slightly irregular period you can get on BC to help regulate it, or cramps, or to help in a safer sex life. no matter what once you get on any form of BC your cycle will be messed with. its the new hormones youll be taking|`|oJ7lCMRsaa	get an iud, it is like $300 i think (get the copper kind). they may be expensive but they last 12-15 years. the first 2-3 months your periods may be a bit worse, but it usually goes away by then. you won't have to worry about it for the 12-15 years and they have really great success rates (better than condoms even). but remember that these or the pill will not protect against stds so always wear a condom unless you are in a monogamous relationship with a partner that you really trust.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	go to a doctor|`|hstwNjNaaa	Ask your doctor. It'll depend on what they think is best, something like Micogynon 30 is a really common one to sort out irregular periods, but everyone's different and your doctor might think another pill would be better for you.|`|Ne9ovJRTaa	everyone's different. some get side effects from different kinds. only your doctor can tell you which is best for you.
rhPCJfeuaa	Diane had most of my ideas, LOL!  But, how about some puzzles and a small book shelf for stories and coloring books.  Get a big tupper for art supplies to keep everything contained.  You can also get a tiny kitchen set on ebay for cheap or craigs list.  Big leggos are always a hit or soft foam blocks.  You could also get a small trunk and fill it with old clothing from you mom and dad to play dress up.  You fahter might get a kick out of that.  Thinking ahead of your childrens ages.|`|AA12221392	maybe a shelf that holds plastic bins for the kids toys while at grandpa's. A small table and chair  set woould be good for coloring, playing with dolls ect. maybe apint the bottom of the walls (if okay with your dad) with chalkboard paint, this gives the kids a chance to draw, and your dad can look at it when he is there by himself, to make him smile and remember the little things about the kids, it could be the special wall ....|`|AA11637178	It kind of depends on what your children like and you know what that is. Also are they going to be in the room by themselves. You might want toys so they can play by themselves. I had a lot of educational toys for my child. We loved doing puzzles, house, store, school, etc.
Xq7MFmgcaa	This is hard to answer because everyone is different. I've heard as soon as 7 days. Also a lot a pregnancy symptoms are PMS symptoms as well.    I wish you luck!  **Baby Dust**|`|NJrsrT12aa	Well get a pregnancy test like First Response that will give you results a few days before you missed period.    The symptoms will come after a few weeks. Your breasts will start to hurt, morning sickness, ect.|`|AIrCtDCYaa	I would wait 6 weeks at least and then go to your doc. Peoples symptoms are all different. Baby dust to you and your fiancee. Me and my hubby have been trying for ever too.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	i think its after the first missed period. gud luk, im ttc. baby dust to you|`|Vs17ceYKaa	every one is diffrent people start to feel it right after implantation takes place and others after the period is due and some dont get nothing but its your first month good luck its been 12 for me so hope your aint as long as mine|`|5cmThMszaa	a pregnancy test ?  but im pretty sure its like 6 weeks.
BUI9HnH1aa	i had a pap a 3 years ago that came back slightly abnormal . The doctor told me i just had to come back in a year , not 2 years.  Your doctor should tell u what needs to be done|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is a question for the doctor -not Yahoo.  if you don't feel confident with your current gyn, get a 2nd opinion.  use condoms.|`|627pWyVkaa	they dont come back "severely abnormal". Just normal(negative), Abnormal, Or cancer. IF yours just came back abnormal It can be just nothing. Usually its a form of HPV that will cause you to get this and generally most of us (heal ourselves) before we even have our next pap test.  Ive had 2 abnormal pap test come back however mine were only ascus which Is the lowest form of "abnormal" result can be the next one is something with an A name as well. It has a scale of upto like 7 for severity which would mean cancer(and you would of had to of had it for several years 10-15) to be that high. Which would be unlikely unless you;ve never had a pap test and you were in your 30's or older.(for example). Look at this site. Youll just need another pap test, possibly have to get colposcopy tests which is another pap test, an acid test(which is just vinegar and water ) test, and a biopsy If they see something with the acid test! Hope this helps. And BTW my third pap test came back normal!!!! Sometimes they just show abnormal results. esp if you had sex 1-2 days before getting your pap done can affect the results.  http://www.cancercare.on.ca/english/home...|`|1Q0dAOffaa	I had one a few years ago to come back abnormal and they just redid the pap.  The doctor tried to explain to me the reason it came back abnormal but I cannot remember it that well.  Had something to do with sometimes the "smear" they get has too many thick cells that they cannot look at properly.  That is all I can remember.  My next one was fine.  Good Luck!  I was nervous too!
ggE85sWRaa	I totally know how you feel.  And your worries are perfectly rational!  Recent studies have shown that some men actually are likely to have spare utueruses floating around in their bodies somewhere.  If his spare uterus was anywhere close to your "love juices", as you say, then yes, there could be a little pee in a pod in there!    There are no store-bought tests available yet for this type of pregnancy, but there will be soon.  You can examine his poop though, if you'd like an excuse to dig through some stinky.  But other than that you will have to wait until these tests are out on the market.    NEXT TIME WEAR A CONDOM, YOU DOUCHE!  Now that you know about the possibilities, I really hope you'll be more careful when you insert your cawk.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	sorry but if he was to be pregnant youd both be very rich as this is very very very very very very impossible, anyone knows this, didnt you listena t skool. this has got to be the most silliest one i have ever heard, real woman are desperate for a baby and carnt have one and you ask this saft question. id go back to bed and your bfriend will tell you the same.|`|FTW82Wumaa	Get a life...
mgiJVjaKaa	You might be pregnant and just not have enough hormone to trigger a positive. Wait a few more days, test again. Make sure you test with your first pee of the day - it has the highest concentration of the hormone.     Good luck!|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes there is a good possibility that you are pregnant.  Sometimes it take a while for your body to produce high HCG levels.  In my first pregnancy it took me 8 negatives until i got my positive.  I was 5 weeks pregnant when i finally got the positive.    I would try testing again in a few day/week with morning urine, if still no results then i would make an appointment at the doctors and have a blood test done as these are more accurate and detect lower levels of HCG that a urine test can't.  One of my friends body took 12 weeks until she got her positive.  It just varies. Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want.  xx
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Wildflower,    You do not mention why this family is unable to care for this child. If it is due to financial reasons, I strongly suggest that if you truly want to help them that you send them a donation so that this boy can remain with his family. If you are unaware of why this family is not able to keep this boy, you might want to find out prior to making any arrangements.     That being said, if this boy really needs a new place to be, are you sure that adoption is the way to go. You should be aware of all the available options out there. Whatever choice is agreed to it should be based on what is BEST FOR THIS BOY.    Could he perhaps stay with you through an available exchange program? He could come stay with you while he is in school and go to be with his family during vacations. There are tons of very reputable exchange programs out there. Programs through the government, educational institutes, international programs and churches are easy to find - just be sure to research the programs and find the one that is right. You would be taking some of the burden off of his family, helping with his education, building a relationship and keeping his family in tact.    http://afs.org/afs_or/home (My Dad used this one.)  http://www.orgsites.com/dc/forte/ (I can help you with this one!)  http://dir.yahoo.com/Education/Programs/...    Have you thought about considering guardianship? This is a much easier and cheaper option to adoption and does not require the child's birth certificate to be changed or the adoption papers sealed away. This way the child can retain his original family and you can still act as his caretaker.    Guardianship does not require always home study, can usually be done in a lawyer's office rather than in court and costs about $200 to $800 vs. $10,000 - $40,000. Guardianship allows for visitation and often support from the original family. It allows the child to retain his inheritance rights also. This is especially good for inter-family situations - which I'm guessing yours is.    Of course all of this needs to be done legally and with full consent of the family *****AND since the boy is 14, I would certainly hope that his wishes are included in the decision making  process!*****    http://www.guardianship.org/  http://www.cwla.org/advocacy/2006legagen...    I think that what you are offering is very commendable but I hope that you will take the time to research and educate yourself to all of the possibilities out there and prepare yourself for what you are possibly getting into! Adoption is very complex once you begin to learn about it and I think you may find that there are other options that may be a bit more suitable. I only listed the ones that jumped to mind. Good luck to you - you have a kind heart! I hope that you are all able to find a way to do what is best for this boy! :)    Peace.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	It would be difficult since he is a citizen of another country. You need to speak to an attorney. Since he is "family", that would make it easier. Google international kinship adoption and take it from there but certainly speak with an attorney.     You may also be able to get guardianship easier.....his citizenship will come in to play somewhere and that will be what would pinch it.     Good luck!!    ETA:   Also look up the Haugue Treaty on International Adoption...this may apply as well. It went in to affect in APril of last year and we (the U.S.) joined it although not all countires did. The purpose was to cut down on child trafficing.....I think it will apply.....so an attorney would be beneficial in this.|`|Wnmg850Paa	You would need to contact a lawyer that specializes in adoption law that would know how to help in this situation. I have heard of people bring family members into the States from Mexico and adopting so I don't know why this would be any different. Good Luck|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Make sure they are letting you adopt not just take him. You need to go through the legal processes. I am sure you know that though. Call an adoption lawyer in your area and ask them what you will need to do. If you are gonna adopt you are gonna have to have a adoption lawyer anyway. Good luck.     Love,  Michelle|`|V5RwxWcJaa	Call a lawyer. Birth parents can definitely consent to giving you custody.  It just needs to be done correctly.  You will still need a home study, birth parents consent forms signed, notarized and witnessed and permission to bring him to the USA.  Unfortunately it will cost you money to get it done legally, but you can do it.  The other option would be for you to get guardianship and not actually adopt.|`|i2sMBoPIaa	Lawyer!! Maybe since it's an open & identified the adoption, it should take no time as long as you get the paperwork so he can leave the country. Make sure they are meaning adoption & not just to take care of for awhile. If the family is not financially capable, remind them that you take care of the $$ for adoption. It will cost them nothing as far as $$. Their hearts will ache for him but maybe they can see each other again in the near future. He is 14. He will be an adult soon. Good Luck!
nrqWwQBXaa	i usually try to not pay any attention to them. but some times they can say things that just make me really mad. yes they just need attention. so if i feel like dealing with them i do. if i am not in the mood i just pass there question?|`|UUpsa35Daa	I've always wondered that too. I mean, they're wasting our time, having us read their question and then baiting most of us to type out a ridiculous answer but some people just find amusement in it.    I've actually came to a point where i find the answers that say "TROLL!" or something to that effect way more annoying. Not only are people feeding attention seekers but they're also falsely accusing some people of being attention seekers solely because they're not open minded enough to actually believe in the slightest that a situation might be true. I mean, you can see a troll question from a mile away, but there are a lot of question that have a sense of truth to them and those questions should be taken seriously until they're proven to be a lie.    I can and do ignore the troll questions but falsely accusing people that ask possibly truthful questions just irks me.|`|VR2biZutaa	I know what you mean... my friend improved a song about a troll under a bridge.  I acccompnied with the steel drum.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I don't realize that they are trolls sometimes until someone points it out. They sure do make everyone angry.

bWu4p5OBaa	Hi I wouldn't stress to much about it. My friends and family all give their kids bottles until they're like 2 at least.     Zoey started drinking out of her sippy at about 10-11 mths.  Try some pure juice mmmh..Zoey couldn't resist that :)  She refuses to this day to drink milk out of a bottle or sippy:(|`|XWQ6Wpv3aa	She'll grow out of it. I remember when I was little, I still used a bottle til I was 5! But it wasn't with a nipple, those tasted horrible back then. I miss those days....|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Again every baby is different. My son started a sippy cup at 7 months but only drinks juice and water out of it. He is now 13 months and I'm trying to take him off the bottle (Dr's suggestion) and he won't drink milk out of a sippy cup. I just keep offering it and he's been drinking more and more. So try to keep offering it daily and try hard before you give in to the bottle she wants. Oh and also ask your pediatrician. They always have great tips for me! Good luck:)|`|Xq7MFmgcaa	I know this sounds bad but keep offering. Even if she refuses. After awhile she'll want it and know that is the only way to get it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, mine has probs with cups too LOL; we have a variety and the only one she will drink out of has no valve...great, right?  don't know what you mean by big kid bottle, but she has bottles with a fast flow nipple...is that what you mean? she switched to those at a few mos old when she got frustrated with the slow ones..|`|xOr67VDiaa	she is still just a baby, but drinks more. its not a big deal if she is still loving her bottle, and the holes on the teats are small no matter what size you buy. Maybe put another hole in her teat and see if that helps. my daughter just turned 2 and she has been drinking from cups/straws/water bottles and everything you can think of since she was 10 months old and she still wants her bottle when she goes to bed .It didn't really bother me b4, its just now she is a 2 year old toddler i want her to stop having a bottle. i wouldn't worry to much, but this is a good age to get her interested in sipping cups/straws and all that. Good Luck|`|BUI9HnH1aa	u can buy different teats for the bottles ,   they will have more / bigger holes in them for a fast milk flow|`|sw2R5A9iaa	she's old enough to use a cup.  most of her calories come in the form of solid food.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	Lots of Dr's have been suggesting to skip the sippy cup (if you have the patience) and go straight to a cup with a lid and straw. They have lots of neat ones. Either the plain old cup with straw or the ones that the straw flips up and then can be pressed back down. Those ones don't leak very much.    It is fine for her to still drink out of a bottle. You can buy faster nipples. They come in different stages.    9 months is the average age (that i have seen) for kids starting to use "big kid" cups with straws or sippy cups.      The only downfall is that she might get use to the milk coming out so fast and getting instant gratification that she might refuse you when you try to nurse her.
AA11840819	For a Girl:  Amelia Kat- I like this one it is old fashioned and cute.  Catherine Audrey- These do not seem to go together so well. No flow to the names  Charlotte Rose- Another old fashioned name. I really like Charlotte. You could also use Catherine with Rose.  Elisabeth Holly-I like this one reversed. Holly Elizabeth  Emily Jane- I love Emily and Jane is ok but I always think of the old Beverly Hillbillies show that had Ms. Jane as a character.  Meredith Joyce- I like Meredith as it sounds important. How about Meredith Renea  Jennifer- I like Jennifer    For a Boy:  Andrew Joseph-Nice name Andrew David would be nice too.  Scott Williams- I guess you mean William. This is a nice name very boyish.  James-Good biblical name could be used with Andrew.    Best of luck with your baby!|`|jsztMEvDaa	I think they're all really nice.|`|Ya1zZORIaa	How about Emily Claire for a girl and Ethan James for a boy.

I like the names and the combination.    Catherine Audrey - I've always liked the name Cathy. I've never been a big fan of the name Audrey, but I'll admit it looks much better with the name Catherine.    Charlotte Rose - I definitely don't really like this name. It's not bad, it's just not my taste. Charlotte is too old-school for me, and Rose is way over-used. It's not ugly or a bad choice, I just like things a little more modern and unique.    Elisabeth Holly - I love the name and the combination, but I don't like the spelling of Elisabeth. It could be confusing later on in life when teachers or sports instructors keep spelling it with a Z instead of an S. My name is Amber, spelled Ambyr, and trophies, report cards, sports shirts, etc. have always been spelled wrong. It kills me.    Emily Jane - I love this name. Most of the time when I see Emily and Jane I don't like it, but for some reason, this combination makes both of them seem awesome.    Meredith Joyce - I don't like this name. Meredith is another old-school name that I'm not a fan of and I don't know any Joyces under the age of 45. Once again, not a bad name, just not my style =(.    Jennifer - It's over-used, badly. You can always funk it up with a cool middle name though. Jennifer Blake, Jennifer Peyton, Jennifer Aeris, Jennifer Alice, Jennifer Lacy, etc.    Andrew Joseph - Very, very, very over-used. Andrew is one of the most common names in the United States and Joseph isn't far from being right there with it. Don't get me wrong, it sounds good, but there's too many Andrew Josephs out there.    Scott Williams - I like the name Scott because most people use it as a middle name. Seeing it as a first name is new and refreshing haha. I think it's cute.    James - Another way over-used name that you can funk up with a cool middle name. James Shawn, James Heath, James Tyler, Derek James, Gavin James, James Braxton, James Cooper, James Parker, etc.|`|CVsJQxiJaa	charlotte rose! and i like the name gavin for a boy|`|OtvYnqAYaa	For a Girl:  Amelia Kate - like the names just dont think they flow  Catherine Audrey- no  Charlotte Rose-love it  Elisabeth Holly- doesnt flow  Emily Jane- love ti  Meredith Joyce- love it  Jennifer-like it    For a Boy:  Andrew Joseph- doesnt flow   Scott Williams- it goes without the s at the end of williams  James- like it

MzHwklzKaa	Have you tried putting her in bed and leaving her alone?    Maybe she doesn't want to be fussed with so much?    Try this:  Lay her in bed and use 1 hand to "rock" her side to side an inch or 2.  Nothing moves but the baby.  Sort of like giggling but use a slower, longer motion.  Don't talk, don't make eye contact, just sit next to the bed.    Try just rubbing her back or tummy.  Don't talk, don't make eye contact, just sit next to the bed.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	can u catch her right before she shows signs of being sleepy/tired and try it a little earlier.....? if not, maybe try 'fussing it out'....or 'controlled crying it out' instead of straight crying it out?gl, hth  this works for my gal; white noise from a rather loud small fan in her room and the womb bear...she's almost 8 mos and it works like a charm...just a suggestion to try....|`|xOr67VDiaa	It's a very hard situation, but while she is young you have to teach her not to be so needy when its sleeping time. its seems mean and blah blah but if you keep up what you're doing, it will only get worse in the long run. its not cruel to let your baby lay in his/hers cot for a while and let them cry and carry on for a while (she is doing it anyway?, you don't have to be there, you just have to learn to block it out.

After a baby has had 3 months to develop it is illegal to have an abortion. Then you can choose adoption or keeping the baby. But if you are going to take my advice you should buy yourself some prenatal vitamins that you can get at any drug store and consult someone on how to keep your baby healthy for that long. Try going to planned parenthood. I think that I am pregnant and when I find out for sure this is what im going to do. Im going to tell my best friend and the father of the baby (IF there is one) and only them so that it will stay secretive. Im 17 years old turning 18 in 5 months. Good luck!|`|HOdblqIkaa	you have to tell them and soon. your 13 weeks which is still early but its gonna be more and more noticeable. if you agree with abortion you can still get one but itll cost more and you have to have parents consent. if your thinking adoption then you might want to get the necessary paperwork and start looking for agencies to work with. your still a minor whatever you do your parents will have to be involved so you need to tell them now. you can pretend all you want, i know i did, but no matter what your having a baby.|`|3zg7oBA5aa	It's not going to just go away, even if you pretend really hard.    You have to use your head. If you don't want a baby, either abort or give it up for adoption.    Either way, TELL YOUR PARENTS.    Tell them, they'll be upset but I know they'll be there for you.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	there's no easy to way to do.  you just need to sit them down and tell them.  when you do tell them, be sure for yourself what your next step is going to be.  try to have answers to possible questions they're going to have.  no offense, but you don't want to sound like a stupid kid who just gets in trouble.  you've gotten yourself into an adult situation, so think it through and have some adult answers ready.  good luck to you.|`|etzhw4j7aa	oh my god i hate questions like this! adoption keep it or abortion. the chose is yours|`|I2e4LFF9aa	just tell them. You should have gone to a doctor already. that is not safe for the baby to wait this long. Decide to keep it or adopt it out. It is selfish to say " If it will fit into my busy schedule " though. You should have had protection. It was your decision. So you should keep it and have to raise it like every responsible parent. I was 17.|`|Tebw0VOdaa	Yes you have to tell them... Just do it, like ripping off a bandage. I'm sure they will be shocked, maybe even disappointed, but all in all they will be the BEST support for you and will love your little baby so much. Also stress is bad for the baby and I'm sure this is causing you a great deal of stress, so that's it... just tell them, you'll be glad you did!|`|j5o5qYmpaa	U gotta tell'em IDK how but u gotta do it it will be as easy as "doin it"|`|Z3ifr1Claa	"I'm not sure if a baby will fit into my busy schedule". wth?! you don't just have sex and then realize a baby might not be the best thing for you, especially since you're so young. if you can't handle the responsibilities of having sex then don't do it at all or at least use a damn condom. Just tell your parents that you need to talk to them and tell them, there's not much to it. If you don't want to tell your parents then again you should've used a condom, but you have to tell because you'll begin showing. Please whatever you do don't abort. The fetus has the potential to be a human being that could do something great with his/her life no matter what circumstance it is born into. If you really don't think you'll have time for it and just not ready that's okay you can always give it up for adoption.|`|Hcy6ySu6aa	Honey, it's obvious they're going to notice if you don't tell them it's best to do it now, rather then trying to explain why you have a big baby bump on your tummy! and honestly you should have not got your self in this situsation in the first place your 15 years old can you honestly see yourself missing your highschool prom because you don't have a babysitter or missing school or possibly getting kicked out depending on your school this is going to affect your WHOLE life no quiting and giving up once you have this baby it's a full time job first of all i suggest going to your mom and talking to her about your mistake and she will probly yell and scream and freak out at first ps say goodbye to your allowence and hello to your room for a while just sit her down and say, mom i have made a huge mistake and i need you to help me as my mom because you are the only one i can trust to give me the right decisions ..... then tell her your really really sorry that this happend and listen to her suggestions ... hope it helps :)|`|4WgsBvq1aa	okay for one you just have to tell them. it will never be the right time so you just have to step up take responsibility and go and tell them.  number two saying you can't have a baby because you have a busy schedule is a stupid reason for not having a baby.  Your home schooled for crying out loud, so if you cant have this baby or keep it then find a better reason for not being its mother. it didnt ask to be conceived.  good luck.

fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Yes. One can argue endlessly to the fact that it's a person or it's not, fact is, nobody can declare anyone pregnant until there's some brain waves... Early detection goes as low as 28 days, by the missed period, and truth is, not a lot of people abort at that stage. Abortion happens later usually, when they get a clue: OMG, what the heck am I gonna do?? I am pregnant!<br>  There's two people at least - and it's wrong, no matter how you argue it. The reason they have to argue this is because it's wrong. You don't argue something that's right. Do you?|`|AA12189772	It is not yet a person, but a potential person.  <br>  <br>  Now, I know of no-one who is "pro-abortion," the term is "pro-CHOICE."  You note it yourself by saying "a woman who is thrilled to hear the news of her pregnancy."  That she is happy and wants to give birth is her CHOICE.   Apparently, you are also pro-choice, as long as that choice is one with which you agree.|`|mP82VSO1aa	To each his own, people are welcome to be pro-life and I can respect that choice. Personally, I don't need a scientific explanation for why I don't consider it a person. I just don't, and I think that in some cases it can be the wisest choice for both the child and parent. It's case-by-case and a personal thing. If that came up with my girlfriend and I, I would give my two cents and back her on whatever choice she made.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It is a person. With a soul. His/Her own dna,blood type. Eye color,hair color,if they will be right or left handed is already decided.|`|xFdz9CMKaa	I've asked this question to many pro-choice people, I've never gotten a good or straight answer.  Usually it's something like "it's just a glob of cells," or "well the baby's and the mother's life will be so much worse off."  I guess I can buy the second argument (except for the fact that there are millions waiting on the adoption list) but there is not a shred of scientific evidence to say that the glob of cells is a chupacabra, a tree, or a screwdriver.  All the genetic material is already encoded, it may be parasitic because it needs the mother, but a separate entity nonetheless.<br>  <br>  Better sex education and better access to contraception is better than abortion, in my opinion, but a lot of churches won't accept that.  Both pro-choice and pro-life people seem to focus too much on the issue of abortion itself and not solutions to keep the numbers down.  I mean, similar to what you said, who screams, "YES I'm going to have an abortion!!"  It's not fun for anyone.|`|mcIpmm1Uaa	I am in NO WAY pro-abortion, but I do believe a fetus begins living when electrical activity commences in the brain. This is when they receive human like abilities such as being able to feel pain. I always questioned the fact that people claim a fetus isn't human...But when the abortionist goes about reassembling little arms and legs to make sure they ripped every part of a fetus out of it's mother, do they doubt it's a human?|`|2CtxIPxeaa	I believe a baby is a living being at conception. Though the baby is just a mass of cells, what makes us human is our DNA... and that is ALL there at conception.<br>  <br>  To Diane... ok fine a baby isnt usually viable at 12 wks, but what about the babies that are born on time but die. Guess they we're fetuses too and could be aborted huh? Or sleeping babies.. but guess we wont go there.|`|6B4sxGsXaa	when a woman finds out she's pregnant she doesnt picture her baby as a fetus, well no woman i have ever some across!!!|`|1veacHkjaa	yes it is a person...fetus actually means child in latin...|`|EOIxLhBxaa	The same way at every mense you don't scream I just lost a baby! it's just a cell at that point.<br>  <br>  edit to the PP What?!?!?! lol Are you stupid? when you get an abortion (miscarriages are called abortions too btw) they do not reassemble the baby. At that stage it is unlikely the baby HAS any arms and definately no legs and no brain no lungs no liver no kidneys no eyeballs... no nose no nothing but a cell. A woman who miscarries at home cannot tell it's a baby just guess the blood clot blob was it. It doesn't get all those things until it's too late to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  deeper thought. if you took a 8 week old baby out and put it on a ventiliator would it look  like a human or breathe? no it has no lungs. It would die immediately and it's chances of it dying inside the womb.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't abort but damn that was so stupid.|`|AA12091210	Hi there.  Gee this is a tough question.<br>  <br>  I believe that every woman has a right to do what is best for them, and that what is the best potential future for their child.  I don't think you can be anti or pro-abortion until you are in those particular shoes and have to make that kind of decision.<br>  <br>  I am speaking from experience here.  I always said that I was pro-abortion, it is a woman's choice and under certain circumstances it is the best decision.  But when we found out at 12 weeks that our baby could have Down Syndrome, I was so torn between right and wrong.<br>  <br>  In my own personal opinion, technically it is just a fetus at this point and it would be kinder to the baby to have it aborted now at this early stage (and I will also admit it would make the future easier for myself, my husband and any future potential children - whether this is right or not, I will admit it was a deciding factor for us).  But the thought of terminating what was technically going to be our child, was absolutely devastating.  We made the decision that we would keep the baby.<br>  <br>  If you have ever been pregnant, you will understand and know the fierce connection a mother has with her unborn child right from the moment it is conceived.  I would do anything to protect my unborn child, whether it is just a fetus or not, it still has a heartbeat which in my opinion means it is a life.  It was created out of love, a little piece of me and the man that I love more than life itself.  How much more special can anything ever be?|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Once concieved :  its A beautiful baby, A living life.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Let me ask you this: Do you call a tadpole a frog, or a tadpole? It will be a frog someday, right? The genes don't change and the blood doesn't change. But it doesn't look like a frog or act like a frog, have the same physical abilities or function outside of water like a frog, because it isn't yet a frog. . . it's a tadpole. . . a POTENTIAL frog. <br>  <br>  An embryo or an *early* fetus doesn't look like a baby, act like a baby, have the same physical abilities or function outside of the womb like a baby. And the vast majority of abortions are performed before 8 or 9 weeks, when it really is nothing like a "baby" in shape, form, function, ability, etc. People can't get late abortions, either. That's another myth. You can't walk into a clinic at 7 months and say "I'd like a partial birth abortion please!" Those are babies that are fully formed and functional and that can be born and survive with relatively little interventions<br>  <br>  Why do women not refer to their baby as a fetus? Because we attach emotion to our pregnancies and bond with our pregnancies. I think that's rather obvious. Being emotionally bonded doesn't make something scientifically true. <br>  <br>  And who here is pro-abortion anyway? NOBODY. People are pro-choice. Nobody likes abortion. I don't like abortion. Despite what I just wrote above I would never have an abortion under almost any circumstance. But what I believe doesn't matter. I refuse to force my beliefs on other people, trying to make myself morally superior, trying to inject my own opinions onto how someone should view life and death and pregnancy and the raising of children. I'll stay out of everyone elses uterus and I expect you all to stay out of mine.
zhJOZhKEaa	I think both reactions (you mostly ignoring and daddy correcting) are reasonable if not done to the extreme.  As you can see it is a *common* problem and many parents have reacted both ways without permanently damaging their children.  Maybe you can calm daddy down a bit by letting him see just *how* common it is with all your responses.    We live near a Christian college that my husband and I both attended.  We sometimes sigh over it becoming less strict in the rules... so my hubby always said our nudist 2yr old daughter was going to get the first degree in "Clothing Optional Choreography" offered by the school because of her love of music and distaste for clothing.      Now this same young lady is 4 (nearly 5) yrs old and into dressing herself in so many layers (of various colors and styles) that she seems to be making up for those days.  She also does her best to change four or five times a day.  She is still fine with her body... she just loves *clothes* more.  We live in fear of the day she discovers credit cards and malls    As long as you aren't helping her strip and daddy isn't calling her a tramp at every turn or trying to cast out her demons I think she'll make it through this one.  :)    Best of luck!    ETA: Mally, very correct and very well said.  With that I'd like to clarify that I'm *not* into encouraging the behavior by laughing/playing along to the child... Hubby and I only joked between the two of us.  I just think you can train many different ways and it doesn't require a very panicked reaction.  (Not that Mally implied it did. :) )|`|HIn1p4OBaa	perfectly normal. my 2 yr old sister is going through the same stage. is she your first? tell your husband not to worry about it, coming from someone who knows what she's talking about.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I think she needs to be taught that although it's funny, her body is her private place, and that she doesn't need to show it off! Though she has a cute little tummy!    Or something like that. That way she knows she has a cute little bod, and isn't ashamed of it, but knows it's not appropriate.|`|vJwl2uoBaa	It is normal!  My daughter was like that and you are right to make her feel confident about her body.  You might try to discourage her (silently) by putting her in things like overalls when you will be out or make sure she is wearing bloomers.  They get out of it!|`|EKdx9iEEaa	There is no need to worry. They all go throug it. Eventually, when she is a bit older you can explain to her about keeping her privates, private and that they should not be displayed in public (or in front of stranger). My daughter is 5 and she still loved running around in the garden with only her brooks on. No need to worry. Don't make a big deal out of it when she does do it or else she will try to get a reaction out of you by doing it often. Good luck!|`|xV0APOtaaa	My daughter is 2 as well. She lifts her shirt and the grocery store, daycare, etc. I don't care. When she gets home she takes everything but her diaper off. After using the potty (before I get her diaper back on) she runs around the house showing off her nakey butt.    It is a phase almost all children go through.For now just let her explore. Making her think she has to hide it will make her think there is something wrong with it later.|`|0ILy1p3taa	My son has done it all his life - and he will be three the beginning of March.  However, cold winters bring atleast a shirt - most days.  He has been potty trined since about 20 months, so for about 3 months prior to that he was encouraged to run nekked - makes catching him to pee easier than soaking through undies or struggling to pull them down to pee on the potty.  Now, even with encouragement of wearing atleast underwear I still find that he likes to go without, and I'm the same way.  We do insist that when we have company that he wears undies & pants - just like mommy & daddy do and we tell him that no one else wants to see his P (we call it by the given name in our house) and that our friends want to see us in clothes.  Now that my daughter is getting around better, we have yet another reason to encourage less nekked butt - if he doesn't get underwear on his sister *might* try to grab at it and pull it off....sends him straight to his drawer to get undies everytime!    With your LO and her daddy freaking out, it is fine that he wants her to keep her dresses down, but have him try a different route - even if they are in the company of friends.  Like "Awe cute belly baby girl, but you don't have underwear on, lets put your dress back down."  And because she is only 2, it WILL need lots of repetition and consistency.  This way she is being taught to keep her dress down without being made to feel shameful of her girly bits being shown off.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Thoughts?    Emma loves belly buttons and also goes around lifting up her shirt showing everyone her belly button.  She will lift up your shirt and look at your belly button.  The funniest thing is when she started going up to other children (in particular a boy the same age as her she plays with some times) and pulls up their shirts to look at their belly buttons.    Opinions?    I think it is cute.|`|ewJqvTx4aa	I think there is a time and a place for everything, and I believe you have to start teaching children from a young age about this concept (of time and place) in order for them to learn life lessons and start to mature.  Is is bad that she is naked or flashing people?  No, I don't believe so.  But is it appropriate?  Probably not.  Yes, our little babe's naked bodies are definitely cute!  And yes, they should know that they have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to those cute bodies.  There are so many ways to bring up a child in love and truthfulness, while never once hurting their self-image.  You can lovingly tell your daughter that this is not appropriate behavior while making her feel good about herself.  Just remember, that while you may think this is cute now, in a few years it may not be so cute and it may be more difficult to train her out of.  You're her best teacher and example and it's never too early to enforce certain expectations.      I know you're a Christian (read your profile) and I know I get a lot out of this verse and maybe you will too!    Proverbs 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	Im sure she'll grow out of it....when she hits her teens then its time to worry! lol|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I think its a pretty typical phase that kids go through.  My oldest is 8, he did this at 3, it stopped.  Now my 3 yr old is doing it, though mostly at home.  We don't care, he just runs around in the buff.  At school so far he is only taking his shoe off, and they tell him to put it on and thats the end of it.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	yourhusbandd probablyimaginess her being on girls gone wild when she is older haha. as of now i think it is fine, but be sure to start teaching her that it is more appropriatee not to as she gets older.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Lots of kids are like that--it seems to be a normal thing.  They are just overjoyed to have a body!  Let her enjoy it while she can.  My nephew and niece used to LOVE dancing around nude after bathtime--they did that until they got to be about 7 years old, then they both became a little shy about exposing themselves so uninhibitedly.  (But, at around that time they discovered they could wake up early and sneak into grandma's bed and have a little cuddle time with grandma who'd tell them stories about what their mom was like as a little girl.)  Another niece would do the lifting her little pink dress thing (she would only wear pink at that stage and only dresses or skirts).  It's just a very cute thing and most sane normal people understand this and find it very cute (and not sexual).  Just leave her be for now, she's a baby still.  Just keep an eye on her.|`|DSSZZBTXaa	LOL they'll eventually grow out of it. When my little sister was a toddler she would always run around naked even outside... She should grow out of that phase within a year or two :) but in the mean time have your husband calm down about it. It's perfectly normal for little ones to do that...every toddler I've know use to do that. Good luck|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my little sister got completely naked until she was about 4. my mom was afraid  to send her to preschool becausee she thought she would get naked at school. Right now she is too little to understand why not. i say don't make a big deal out of it. my son runs around naked all the time. though lately he likes to wear a diaper because he doesn't want to go on the floor- he freaks out if he poops anywhere other than the potty and the diapers lol.    EDIT- my mother never made a big deal out of it and my little sister is very comfortable with herself  MY opinion, i don't think she'll be doing it at school :) if people get freaked out by it then they obviously have not spent much time around kids:) My son will jump out of the tub while my fiance's friends are over and run around with all his glory hanging out lol.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	I think its fine. Just try and explain to her that girls don't lift up their clothes and that her boobies are private and not for everyone to see.    My 3 yr old still runs around the house naked all the time...and she would probably prefer it that way but she knows that in public its not ok or funny to purposely show off her privates!|`|kpi69PHWaa	I think you're going about this in totally the right way. A lot of little kids do this sort of thing; she'll stop on her own. It sounds like your husband is overreacting.|`|U88H6YlEaa	I think, ignore it. there is no reason to shame a child because we can see her beautiful body. She will grow out of it, although having said that, I have a almost 8 yo girl who I have to tell to put on clothes, she prefers naked.   Obviously, keep them safe.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Man, if your toddler is a nudist so is my kids, lol.    I hear funny stories on how my SIL used to run out the house butt naked and how they caught my MIL chasing her down outside, lol.    it's all normal, what helped us with my 2 year old is that we have her pick out her own clothes, she likes wearing them if she picks it, go figure, lol.|`|s4iVl04raa	I think it's perfectly healthy for her to be proud and curious about her body, and also probably enjoying the attention she gets from doing things like lifting up her dress, especially if you laugh! :) When I was little I ran around in just a diaper all the time, as well as my niece and nephew, especially in the summer when it gets so hot. If your husband is uncomfortable or concerned, maybe just teach her not to do it when you're out in public, like at the store? But let her do it at home? She'll probably grow out of it eventually anyway. I'd let her have fun! It's not hurting anyone.|`|uy6sBhipaa	you need to ask an 'expert' why she is doing this - at her age behavior is learned and mimiced  - it is not independent free will --
ts4Dg5TDaa	My friend and I used to exactly like that. You just tell her little things she might not have known and soon so will she. Eventually you should work up to tell her about your problem. Try very casually cause if you make a big deal so will she. If she cares she will listen and be there. I hope this saves your from the mistakes I made. And I hope you can recover from cutting. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone who knows you personally feel free to email graceofsuburbia@yahoo.com|`|tBwdVpG4aa	If you're cutting you have something to worry about that is 10000x more serious than anything else you mentioned.    Maybe she already knows about the cutting and that's why she doesn't want to talk to you about some of her problems.  You've got enough of your own.    Seriously, stop worrying about your friend, who is going to be OK, and get help for yourself.  You are on a self-destructive path.|`|35eihkZmaa	it isn't like that for me but sometimes i feel like it is. maybe she feels the same as you do, u never know. if u r the first to open up, she will 2. however, dont just announce that u cut. tell her that u need to tell her something because u need some1 2 help u right now and that u really need her! then, tell her that u cut. and id hope that u want to stop!   cutting isn't good! u may think that it helps but it just makes things worse. physical pain is different from emotional pain, and one doesn't counteract the other. instead focus on happy stuff! when you feel down watch spongebob on tv r something to cheer up! if shes a true friend shell b ther 4 u wen u need her and shell realize u can do the same 4 her.|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	I'm in exactly the same situation (- the yahoo profile)  and we dont talk bout stuff like that, even though ive known her for longer that my other friends. i act a lot younger when i am with her, that with my other friends, and shes more of a nerd than them, and me. but me and my other friends talk bout stuff i could never talk bout with her + ive cut before but no one knows (i find ways to do it without people seeing.)...    (my other friends are in my class at school and she isnt so they aren't friends with her.)    i wouldnt tell her bout the cutting straight away but maybe mention you found her Y!A profile.
HhQtrjQGaa	I know, same problem...right now too actually. I've never brought it up with my mom...ackward.     how would that conversation go???     "um mom...you have sex way to loud...and that's fine and great...but I don't even want to think about my mom bumping and grinding...so keep it down."    I mean...they must plan it for when I'm home, because I'm over 18 and I stay out late and stuff.    Whatever I try to ignore it.|`|9KsxYINMaa	You Should Like, sit in your room with a phone and make the same noises your mom does.  then she will come in and be like what are you doing.  and be like  trying out what i hear you doing every night.  it may be embarrassing to say, but it will be revenge, and trust me, it like, wont happen again.   edit: i thought of another brilliant idea.    leave her a note, or send her a text while they are doing it, saying  'I hope you are using condoms in there'.    xx|`|Bf4ipf7Xaa	HIT THE WALL!!!! Haha|`|QqRARcOeaa	Bang on the wall. Walk past the room saying WTF or leave the house and when your parents ask why say because i can heard you guys doing it and it disturbs me!|`|uUeeHL80aa	No that could just cause more tension about it. I always heard my mother having sex with her various boyfriends she had over some years now during the week sometimes but mostly weekends I hear. Unless you are really close with your mom dont mention it in common conversation. Do what I did and buy some kickbutt headphones to listen to while they do it since im guessing they dont go at it like teenages for hours at a time, so thats not a big problem for you.|`|QSodlfMraa	turn the radio up.|`|uB0QueSOaa	you should talk to your mom and tell her that you hear her having sex with your step dad and if they could keep it down and tell her that you feel uncomparable hearing them having sex im sure shell understand|`|csGKIic9aa	have louder sex|`|sKmQVwQMaa	bang on the wall when they do it,  or walk down the hallway past their room and kinda stomp to make a hint.|`|AA11371251	next time you have sex make it loud and then when she says something just say something like since you always have to hear her you didn't think it would be a problem I'm sure she'll quiet down after that|`|ts4Dg5TDaa	be really loud so they know you're awake and could hear everything. Or just say "what were you doing last night that was so loud?" they'll get the hint.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	Just listen to music, watch TV, or whatever else you can do to drown out the sound.

I guess they just can't get enough ;) I wouldn't tell them to stop. Just say "Umm, you guys are kinda lound... :S" Then they will probably be quieter because they are embarrased ;p.

UAunAKdtaa	your doctor is right. i know it looks weird to you, but by eating foods and drinking juices, your baby keeps his balance perfect by himself. our body is designed to convert fats into energy and energy back into fat when not in use. your baby wasn't born model-thin exactly because of this. he was born ready to balance his nutrition. my son started drooling like crazy at 4 months also, but he didnt show any teeth until about 6 months. your baby is so not ready to eat solid foods. if you wanna start feeding him with a spoon, go ahead, but do it with rice cereal and no more than once a day, and it should be very thin. your baby's tummy isnt ready to take hard foods like blended chicken and rice yet. i was anxious too, but it is best to wait, best for your baby.if your baby drinks his milk well, has normal stool and generally is healthy, then dont think about rebalancing...he will do it himself.no fish oil, it's too different from your baby's body composition, and he may throw up.
86f625d9ffc20e37a8b5cc419322fe53aa	your baby will be fine, using the mild soap is a great idea, but, continuing to attempt further irrigation of the eye may cause more irritation than your little one currently has unless done by a professional.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	What you did was just fine.  You are using wash that is designed for babies. They keep that it mind when they are making the stuff. So don't worry.    The redness and rubbing was probably more from the water than the soap.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	if you already rinsed it out..then with one time is enough...    since you see it not working because he still has his eye somewhat irritated, i suggest you take him to a pediatrician...    i highly doubt you caused damage...its just soap and water...no worries...    best thing to do if this continues...go see a doctor asap...=)
49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	You should definitely consult with a lactation expert. You can ask your Dr for suggestions or go to     LaLecheLeague:  http://www.llli.org/resources.html?m=0    Or   http://www.kellymom.com/    They both have been very useful to me as a breasfeeding mother|`|1Q0dAOffaa	Mine just kept going away to nothing even after trying Rx meds and herbs.  I finally just had to be happy with what she had gotten for the first 3 months.  ( You can try to get a Rx for Reglan or use the herb Fenu greek)|`|gx4s68s8aa	Really- hand expression works best for you.  Sorry, but I honestly can't believe that.  Either you are using the wrong electric pump, using not incorrectly or something.    An electric pump is likely the way to go.  I exclusively pumped for 12 months and I never had any success with a hand pump.  However, I can tell you that an electric pump there might be an adjustment time to it.  My breasts took a few weeks to get completely used to the electric pump and for me the pump did make my breast hurt for a while until I adjusted to it.      When or if you use an electric pump the secret few people tell you is breast massage- massage your breast before and if possible as you pump.  It will make pumping much easier.  I think if you do that you will see results rather quickly.    Not trying to be critical-  I honestly just didn't understand.  You didn't put that much information in your question.  I had no idea.  Some people come on her and ask questions and they have not even really tried to work the problem out much themselves.  I just was trying to understand more.  I didn't mean to offend you at all.  I was just trying to help.
1Q0dAOffaa	Do you want it for lactation or nausea?  If you are pregnant, the ones they will give for nausea are Phenergan, first as it is cheaper.  If that does not work you will get Zofran.  Neither worked too good for me as I will sick for 9 months. LOL  For lactation, try the herb Fenugreek ( smells like maple syrup) or get a RX from your doctor for Reglan.  Hope this helps a little.|`|zwctZ812aa	No..everyone doesn't use it but you.  Drug users use it! This isn't the right section for this.  You're talking to parents of newborns and babies...not exactly the drug using community for the most part.    Edit:  Well if you would have put that it was for lactation in the first place, you probably would have gotten a different answer.  Not everyone knows what that drug would be used for, all you had stated was that you were looking for an illegal drug. I apologize if I offended you, but the question wasn't complete.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I assume prescribed by your doctor...that's how I got mine here!|`|W6uHaI1kaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Wher...

My husband and i are ttc  1 and its a little hard. i hope this month i am. today is my 28 day i usually start 29 Fingers crossed ..if you want to know more about it go to yahoo and type it in . it gives you more information about it !! Good Luck Sweeite....Lots of baby dust !!!!|`|wLChaSKfaa	it has been pretty much laid out for you with the first answer but i just wanted to give you some hope.  i was diagnosed with endometriosis via laproscopy in jan of 06.  from there, my dr told me i had too many lesions from the endometriosis to be able to conceive without fertility drugs if i didnt conceive in the 6 months following.  well... i didnt conceive in that time and my ex husband and i ended up splitting up a year or so later.  then i got with my current husband and we conceived within the first 5 months, with no fertility drugs what so ever.  that was jan of 08 that i conceived the first time.  i ended up having a miscarriage (nothing to do with the endometriosis, just an abnormality with the amniotic sack) and was pregnant again mid may 08, also with no fertility drugs.  now i am sitting here awaiting the arrival of my little girl who is due on feb 7th.  also, my sister also has endometriosis and was told she would not be able to have kids and her 5th child just turned 1 year old, also with no fertility drugs.  i hope this helps you have some hope.  good luck!!!|`|ETL9hDIBaa	I personally don't know if I have it, but two of my aunts have it and I am in the process of being tested.  I asked them when they were diagnosed with it, as they both have kids.  One of them found out and shortly after finding out got pregnant with my cousin and was told to keep trying if she wanted more.  She was told that just after having a child she would be more fertile.  My other cousin is 1yr and 7months apart.    My other aunt also found out but she found it a little bit harder to conceive but was also able to do it naturally.  Both later went on to have full hysterectomies before the age of 30 due to all the pain and problems it caused.      So no matter how much you read that it says that you can't or it will be extremely difficult, don't look at that.  Its definitely possible, you just have to think positively.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	Summary: Endometriosis is very common; the cause -- and why some women have endometriosis and many others do not -- has not been fully fathomed, although there are several prevalent theories; most women with endometriosis have no symptoms; but pelvic pain during menstruation or ovulation is a frequent symptom of endometriosis; endometriosis may be suspected by during a physical examination; it is confirmed by surgery, usually laparoscopy; the available treatment includes medication for pain, hormone therapy, and surgery.     Endometrial cells line the uterus and are normally shed each month during menstruation. When endometrial cells grow outside the uterus, the cells implant. These implants occur most commonly within the fallopian tubes and on the outside of the tubes and ovaries, the outer surface of the uterus and intestines and anywhere on the surface of the pelvic cavity. They can also be found, less often, on the surface of the liver, in old surgery scars or, very rarely, in the lung or brain.     Endometrial implants respond to the hormones of the menstrual cycle just as does the normal endometrium. The implants build up during the month and then they break down and during menstruation they bleed internally. Blood from the implants cannot leave the body via the vagina (or by other exit). The internal bleeding, tissue inflammation and, later, scarring cause the symptoms of endometriosis.     Endometriosis occurs in the reproductive years. The average age at diagnosis is 25-30. (It has been reported in girls as young as 11.)     The central theory of the cause of endometriosis is retrograde menstruation. Blood and endometrium tissue from the uterus back up into the fallopian tubes and drip into the pelvic and abdominal cavity. Retrograde menstruation may, it is thought, be due to a defect in the uterus or it may be related to the way the uterus contracts when it is expelling the menstrual tissue. Genetic factors and the immune system probably are also important in determining which women develop endometriosis and where the endometrial cells implant.     The common symptoms and signs are pain (usually pelvic) and infertility. Pelvic pain usually occurs during or just before menstruation and lessens after menstruation. Some women experience pain or cramping with intercourse, bowel movements and/or urination. Even a pelvic examination by a doctor can be painful.     The intensity of pain may change from month to month and vary greatly among women. Some women experience progressive worsening of symptoms while others can have resolution without treatment.     Endometriosis can cause infertility. When laparoscopy is done for infertility studies, endometrial implants can be found in some patients, many of whom may not have painful symptoms of endometriosis. It believed that endometriosis bleeding, inflammation, and scarring can cause distortion of the female reproductive organs (such as obstruction of the fallopian tubes), resulting in infertility. However, the severity of the disease is not necessarily directly related to the degree of infertility.     Other symptoms related to endometriosis include lower abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, low back pain, irregular or heavy menstrual bleeding, or even blood in the urine. Rare symptoms of endometriosis include chest pain or coughing blood due to endometriosis in the lungs, headache and/or seizures due to endometriosis in the brain.     Endometriosis can become cancerous in less than 1% of women. Most of the cancers found with the condition, however, appear not to be associated with the implants, but rather occur independently of the disease.     How is endometriosis diagnosed?    Endometriosis can be suspected based on symptoms of pelvic pain and findings during physical examinations in the doctor's office. Occasionally, the doctor can feel nodules (endometrial implants) behind the uterus and along the ligaments that attach to the pelvic wall. At other times, no nodules are felt, but the examination itself causes unusual pain or discomfort. Unfortunately, neither the symptoms nor the physical examinations can be relied upon to establish the diagnosis of endometriosis. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, can be helpful in studying the pelvis, but still cannot accurately diagnose endometriosis. Direct visual inspection and tissue biopsy of the implants are necessary for accurate diagnosis.    Currently, the only accurate way of diagnosing endometriosis is at the time of surgery (either by open standard laparotomy or laparoscopy). Laparoscopy is the most common surgical procedure for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is a minor surgical procedure done under general anesthesia or in some cases local anesthesia. It is usually performed as an out-patient procedure (the patient going home the same day). Laparoscopy is performed by first inflating the abdomen with carbon dioxide through a small incision in the navel. A long, thin instrument (laparosc|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Do I have endometriosis? Hell yes! I would love to help. I had it since I was 16. I had 4 surgery's because it was so bad. Endometriosis causes you to have painful, unbearable cramping even when you don't have a period. When you have a period it gives off this sticky substance that sticks to the lining of tour uterus and tubes. I had it so bad that it got stuck to my left Fallopian tube and my large intestine and my colan. I had to have major emergency surgery and ended up w/ a temporary colostomy for 3 months. You can have surgery where they go in through your belly button and remove some of it. Some medicine is steroids or birth control to stop the periods. You have one period every 3 months. At 15 they said I couldn't have kids. I was so sad and depressed. But 2 years ago I got pregnant. My doctors were shocked to say the least. I'm now pregnant w/ my second child. Keep in mind I have one Fallopian tube! Don't give up.

I found having the shower running Straight onto the base of my back helped or you could have a bath - try to relax.

Good luck hun!  =)|`|AA12091210	You should call the hospital and speak to your midwives, or whoever your main caregiver has been, and explain what is happening to them.

rVs2nfgGaa	well if he can't make it i think this would be cool. But remember it is just like on juno where a girl becomes a mother when she is pregnant and a guy becomes a father when he sees his baby. But i would try to see if he could come to the 3d ultra sound because that is something to see in person! Congrats!|`|HclKftzAaa	my hubby LOVED seeing the ultrasounds. the 2d ones as well as the better ones. But he wasn't freaked out before hand.    I think if you gave him notice that you were going to stream the scan to him so he could see it, then it would absolutely bring him closer to the baby. Don't just send it without telling him what you're up to though! lol. He needs time to prepare and setting up his computer so he can receive the scan will distract him from the 'oh my god i'm having a baby' thing. But seeing the scan in real time, especially in the 3/4d, will help him realize that he's been part of something very special.

wziUVyVoaa	Lorelei Renae - I love the combination and the spelling. I know the name will be hard to pronounce in school and whatnot, but it's still pretty nonetheless.    Emily Nichole - I love the name Emily, but the middle name Nichole is used way to much. It's a beautiful name, it's just too common for me.    Deven Rochelle - I LOVE this. It's unique and beautiful. The spelling is perfect and the middle name goes great with the first.    Calleigh Rhiannon - I like the first name and the way you spelled it, but I don't really like the name Rhiannon. I went to school with a girl named Rhiannon, and everyone called her Rhi-Rhi =/.    Heather Michelle - Once again, a very very popular and over-used name. It's very pretty, but too common for me.    Lillian Grace - Absolutely beautiful. I love the name Lillian and Grace is the perfect middle name to compliment it. This is my second favorite out of all the names.    Chelsea Brooke - I like the name Brooke, but Chelsea is very very very over-used.    Riley Anne - I love the name Riley. It's being used quite often right now, but it's for good reason. It's a beautiful name that can be used for a girl or boy. Anne as a middle name goes good with almost anything.    Marley Anne - This is my first favorite. No one ever names their daughters Marley, and I think it's a beautiful, beautiful name. Marley Anne just goes together. If I named my daughter that, I'd never call her Marley. I'd always call her Marley Anne, and I'd love it!    Lauren Elizabeth - Both of these names are over-used, but somehow together, they made an extremely beautiful name. I love it. I really do.    Devin Michael - I've always liked the name Devin, but Michael is in, like, the top 5 most used names.    Michael Adam - Both of the names are okay, but very popular. I can only imagine how many Michael Adams are out there.    Logan Reese - I LOVE IT. I have always loved both of these names. They're adorable and work oh-so-well together.    Johnathon Alexander - Fairly popular, but just not my cup of tea. =(    Noah David - This name is so cute. The names Noah, Ian, Elijah, Isaiah, and other names of that sort have always struck my fancy.    Caleb Henry - This was in the top 3 of the names I was deciding on. I love the name Caleb and Henry was my grandfather's name. We ultimately decided on Gavin Henry, but I still love this name.    Blake Michael - It's okay. But, again, too common for me.    Isaac Matthew - I really, really like this name. Isaac is beautiful and another name no one uses anymore.    Andrew Aaron - I don't like this name =(. The names are wayyyyyyy to common and two names starting with the same letter can be very confusing, especially if your initials are AA.|`|vvAyfBGCaa	My favorite names are Riley Anne, Lillian (Lilly) Grace, and Isaac Matthew.

I like the name Lori though. Renae is cute for a middle name.  Emily Nichole- too common.  Deven Rochelle- very cute!  Calleigh Rhiannon- beautiful name.  Heather Michelle- too common.  Lillian Grace- I like Grace, but not Lillian.  Chelsea Brooke- once again, too common.  Riley Anne- Riley is better for a boy name. don't like Anne that much either.  Marley Anne- I like Marley, it's cute.  Lauren Elizabeth- don't like it.    My favorite out of the girl names is Calleigh Rhiannon. (: It's so pretty!      Devin Michael- I like it.  Michael Adam- it's okay.  Logan Reese- reminds me of that guy off Zoey 101 lol.  Johnathon Alexander- I like Alexander alot. I would probably use as a first name and call him Alex.  Noah David- very very cute!  Caleb Henry- don't like it.  Blake Michael- love it.  Isaac Matthew- don't really like Isaac.  Andrew Aaron- don't sounds too good together.      My favorite out of the boy names are Noah David & Blake Michael. (:|`|vGcuw5Eaaa	Lorelei Renae is simply splendid! May I suggest the spelling "Lorelai Renee"?

You should take another pregnancy test just to be sure.

GU3RauKOaa	Here, I'm copying and pasting this from one of my previous best answers for someone who asked pretty much the same question. THis is what I said:    "Well the contractions started on the morning of the 15th and got progressively worse all day. By night time my hubby was home and they were pretty regular. SO i was already miserable. Then I went to do laundry at like 2 in the morning because I was NOT going to the hospital with no clean clothes. So we got there at 4 am on the 16th and she was born at 4:17 am on the 17th so that's a long darn time to be in pain.  I was exhausted and the contractions were getting so bad I didn't really pay much attention to what was going on around me. I was falling asleep during the contractions (you will find it amazing that your body will make you pass out between contractions or pushing and wake up during them if you have a long labor. Its like your body knows it needs to sleep and forces itself asleep.)  Anyway, they gave me a cervix ripening agent and I wasn't allowed to eat for a long time so I was starving. The external fetal monitoring was SO uncomfortable. Listen! Don't let them leave it on all the time. Let them put it on every now and then to make sure the baby is ok, but the best thing you can do is get up, move around, try different positions to progress the labor and ease your pain. I learned my lesson the first time, now I know for the second baby.  So eventually they let me eat (after the cervix thingy fell out) and I threw up so that sucked. So finally I got the epidural. before labor I was scared of the epidural, but once I was in the hospital I was SOOO grateful for it. All of my pain was gone and I coudln't move my legs. It was awesome. So I got a little sleep but then they let the epidural run out completely. It was just a tease! But it did help me rest and recover to get ready for pushing.  Pushing: Well I started at 10:30 pm and she was born at 4:17 am so that is a LOT of pushing! I had a tear and (though they didn't tell me until after she was born) I was gushing blood with every push. The doctor was pushing gauze down HARD to hold the blood in. Anyway, after pushing for freaking ever her head came out and they said stop pushing. I was thinking about just pushing anyway, but I decided not to (good idea! lol) Then she started giving me shots to numb the area and I was trying so ahrd to figure out why I was getting shots when the head was already out. I thought that was it! Well then she says "On the count of 3 push! 1...2...3..." *snip*snip* Then I understood, lol. She was doing an episiotomy and just didn't tell me (i was pissed about that, i would have liked to have been told). Well I tell you what, there is no greater relief in the world than having some cut you open when a pair of giant shoulders are passing through! Anyway, after that I had to get stitches so they cleaned the baby off on my belly but gave her to my husband and my mom to hold. I got stitches and was shocked that I was still having contractions. You have them afterwards for a while because your uterus needs to tighten back up. Anyway, the pain from the episiotomy lasted a while but it was all worth it and I'm going to be doing it again in august.  The worst part overall I would say is the pressure that the baby puts on your bladder. It feels like you have to pee SOOOOO bad but you don't its just the baby's head. That was the unbearable part for me. But its different for everyone so who knows? It could be easy for you.    Sorry my post is so long but you asked for details!!"    But I will add, since you want the gruesome details, that you will bleed like a crazy mofo for weeks afterwards (I mean a LOT!) and you will usually acquire a lovely hemmorrhoid or two, and if you have stitches plus a hemmorrhoid then it is really hard to poop for a week or more afterwards. They will give you a stool softner and a water squirt bottle to clean off with, but its still uncomfortable. Oh and yes, unless you have an enema, most people poop while in labor, the baby moving through and the pushing just forces it out. But the staff knows this and are very discreet cleaning you up, so no big deal. Just be happy if you're not like my mom who had explosive diarrhea when she was pushing!!!    Good luck dear, hope I didn't gross you out!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Okay my labour started Wednesday 14th January at 3:30am with very very irregular back contractions. 1pm that afternoon, I started taking note of when they were happening, and they were very irregular but not enough to make me cry... yet. They continued happening all afternoon, evening and night, therefore I couldn't sleep. It got to 4:30am and they were absolutely unbearable, the pain was absolutely horrendous. Got into hospital at 5am, got gas and air, plus the pethidine by half 5. I was 2cm and 80% effaced. By half 8, I was in so much pain and sleep deprived I had the epidural (I do NOT remember having it adminstered, nor do I rememeber consenting to it, that's how out of it I was), during this time I was talking a load of crap - I was giving the anethisist (sp?) a lecture on morning sickness and what makes it better (lol). Anyway, the epidural gradually took away the contraction pain, but I was bedbound for my labour, I wasn't allowed to eat in case I needed an emergency c-section (so I went over 14 hours without eating), I had a catheter which was horrible BUT I was able to nap somewhat. By Midday I was 8cm dilated, by half 1pm I was 10cm and I *think* I began pushing around 3pm.... I couldn't feel my contractions so had to be told when to push, I had to dig my nails into my thighs and because I was numb from the waist down, I still have scars there two weeks later. My daughter was born at 3:45pm, but I couldn't feel her coming out, so to look down and see a baby there was a HUGE shock (and has affected my bonding with her). I needed stitches as I had a 2nd degree tear, which wasn't nice. After being transferred onto the ward, I wasn't allowed to leave my bed for hours cos of the epidural, plus I still had the catheter in. Due to that, I wasn't able to wear underwear so (and this is TIM) I was sitting in bed, pad between my legs on some "nappy" material type things to soak up the blood. So I got an awful night's sleep cos I couldn't lay down.   Overall, I really did not enjoy my labour. Purely because of the epidural.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL... are you sure you want to do this to yourself? :P    Anyway, my labor was induced on April 3rd at 5:30 PM by the doctor breaking my water(they induced because of my son's heart beat and high blood pressure for myself). I spent about 12 hours dilating and in that time my contractions got so bad I was throwing up during some of them. The epidural didn't work well on me so I felt quite a bit of pain. When I finally started pushing it was probably around 5:15-5:30 AM on April 4th. I pushed for four hours but my son was only getting so far. My husband and my mom both said they would see his head and it would pop back in. By this time I was exhausted and they decided it would be best to do a C-section. My wonderful, beautiful, son was born at 9:42 AM on April 4th with meconium in his lungs and his cord wrapped around his neck three times.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I need to know this as well. Thanks for asking... I hear you poop most of the time when pushing your baby outt offff theeere!|`|zwctZ812aa	I woke up at about 1:00 in the morning with a contraction and realized I was wet.  I went to the bathroom and thought I was just peeing, but it seemed like kind of a lot and was tinged green (turned out to be meconium)  I called the hospital and they told me to lay down for twenty minutes and then stand up and call them to make sure my water had broken.  MY contractions were already only 2 minutes apart and when I called them back they said to come in.  Because my water had already broken, they didn't want to do an internal exam so I didn't get to find out how I was progressing.  By about 5 in the morning my contrations were hell and I was so exhausted.  I had been trying to walk around, but what most people don't realize is your water continues to leak until the baby is born, so I really didn't like walking around leaking.  The nurses made me drink apple juice because they said it would help give me some energy and it made me throw up. I opted for the epidural because I couldn't take it anymore.  It was the best decision I ever made, I even got to take a much needed nap.  I was almost 4 cm when I got the epidural (they checked to make sure it wasn't too early to get it) and 2 hours later I was 6 cm and still feeling happy with the loss of feeling of contractions.  After awhile I started feeling a bad pressure and asked the nurses to check me again.  They kept saying I wasn't ready, but my mom told them to humor me.  They finally did check and could see my son's head! I had to push for just under 2 hours, but my son was finally born with the cord around his neck once and his hand on top of his head.  During pushing, the nurses were whispering to each other and wouldn't tell me about what, but just told me to breath through an oxygen mask between contractions.  Afterwards, they explained it was because my son wasn't getting enough oxygen because the cord was wrapped around his neck.  I didn't get to hold him for about 15 minutes because he had to examined by the pediatric specialist due to the meconium.  Beware that if there is meconium in your water, you will have to have a pediatric nurse and pediatric specialist in the room to check the baby immediately after birth.  They did not simulate my son to cry until after they suctioned out his mouth, and I wish they would have warned me they were going to do that (it is common practice so they don't suck the meconium into their lungs)  Anyways, it worried me that he didn't cry right away and I was freaking out.  Good luck with your baby!!!    Edit- some more details, I didn't tear at all and I'm tiny and my son was just under 9 pounds.  Ask to deliver on your side if possible, my midwife suggested this and it did the trick.  That and she did perineal massage when my son was crowning.  Kept me intact which was great!  If you do get the epidural, ask to have it turned down when you go to push if it is still working well.  That way you can feel the contractions so you know when to push.  When I first started pushing I had just had the epidural turned down, so it was still blocking most of the pain.  I had a hard time pushing because I didn't know how hard I was pushing.  It was much easier to get my son out once the feeling was back.  Hurt like hell, but much easier and when you're in that position, anything that speeds up the process is worth it!|`|KWHiJbhaaa	Alrighty here we go... lol   My son was induced at 41 weeks 5 days, I was put on a pit drip and it was terrible!!! I was experiencing light contractions then bam they turn up the pitt drip and I'm contracting ever 5 minutes then every t3 minutes and finally every minute, so finally after 12 hours of this I decided to get an epidural(thank god for those!) they got the cathater for the epidural in fairly easy and the contractions hurt worse then the actual epidural. After the epidural you go numb pretty quickly I remember I couldn't even feel anything down there and when you have to move lol good luck. they put in a catheter after the epidural which I didn't feel because I was numb it took about 15 minutes but finally the epidural kicked in and the pain was finally gone. I had a very bad reaction too all the meds (pitocin,staidol and antibiotics) so I vomited the whole entire time including while pushing my son out. When it was finally time to start pushing the doctor broke my water and I started to push when they turned my epidural off!!! oh god let me tell you it felt like no other pain in the world, then I started vomiting and thank god because it was the only way my son was going to come out my body was so fatigued that my retching from vomiting forced his head into my pelvis and out to the world. in fact I was still vomiting when the doctor told me the baby was out. I tore in three places one on the inside and one all the way back into my anus (they heal quickly). I bled profusely and lost enough to require a transfusion(not normal). I also had trouble getting my uterus to firm back up so the nurse kept massaging it(hurts almost as bad as labor). Umm yeah thats pretty much it but I'd do it again in a heartbeat lol good luck ladies|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I was 9 days overdue. My due date was July 2, my baby ended up being born the early morning of july 11 at 647.     anyways, at 7 days over, still no signs of labor. Incredibly uncomfortable with swollen feet/ankles/calves, heatrtburn, and constant crotch pain like I'd been riding my bike nonstop for 3 days. was not dialated at all and only 20 percent effaced. so my dr scheduled an induction for me on friday, july 11th (ironic huh?).     on July 10th, at 8 days overdue, after going for a long walk, all day I experienced brief stabbing pains in my stomach and back and vagina. then, around 5 pm they got worse and more frequent like every 30 min. I felt like I was going to have diahrreah and actually thought I was so I kept running to the bathroom. Then they got even more close together and I touched my stomach and realized I was having contractions bc it was balling up really tight. It got to the point where I would have to stop everything I was doing and just cringe in pain, waiting for it to stop. Everytime I layed down, it would come back and lying down for some reason made them even more painful so I kept pacing back and forth. I called my l and d unit and they said to come in until they were 5 min apart.     but it got to be too painful and they ended up being5 min apart. I was going in with my bf hoping to just get some pain meds to help me get through the night til I came in the next day for my induction. I was even hesitant of going in for fear I would be turned away bc of not being dialted enough. My bf insisted I go and I am grateful he did.     It turns out I had suddenly developed pre-eclampsia (can come on anytime, though the last 3 weeks I did have all the warning signs except for protein in my urine), with a blood pressure of 160/110 and they told me if I went home, I could have a seizure.     So I stayed and they induced me that night, first stabalized my blood pressure with mag sulfate, gave me some pain meds for the natural contractions (morphine) I was having, and then gave me pitocin. one big IV lol. The pain meds worked for awhile like 3 hrs but then when the pitocin kicked in they wore off. I went from 1cm dialated naturally to 9 cm in 4 hrs. I went to sleep for a little while like an hour and woke up screaming in pain from pitocin-induced contractions. I was thrashing around in my bed, crying and cussing like a sailor. The worst part was I couldnt walk around bc of all my frickin' iv's. I screamed at my bf to wake up and comfort me and he did. I was in agonizing pain from my back to my stomach. when the contractions get you, they get you, theres no blocking them out in my experience. the nurse just kept saying "those contractions are horrible' so matter of factly.     When she checked me down there and saw I was already 9 cm (she was shocked with us), she brought me to the active labor dept and an anesthetiologist gave me the epidural I asked for in the beginning. The big needle felt like a big pinch but compared to the contractions it was nothing. After that I didnt feel anything. I was totally out of it giving birth, as I was on mag sulfate, oxygen, and epidural. I didnt even feel my daughter coming out of me.     I had a really easy delivery though---only pushed for 2 hrs. They ended up giving me an episiotomy bc her head couldnt fit through my hole (sorry if too graphic). She wasnt event hat big though---7 lbs 5 oz and 20 inches long. Honestly the contractions were as bad as I expected, but the giving birth part was so easy for me---partly bc the epi, but partly bc I got lucky and had such a short delivery and pushed for just 2 hrs.    oh and just a interesting tidbit---my water never broke, it came out WHOLE! like a water baloon. the intern who delivered my baby said she had never seen that before, and the nurse said she had seen it once before and she was an older experienced nurse.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Congrats! Well here we go.  I had my beautiful baby boy 3 weeks early! He is gorgeous!   I was just getting ready to make dinner on New Years of last year when all of a sudden my water broke. I was so happy he was finally coming.I was admitted to triage and waited for like an hour until our room was ready. The doc put me on pitocin to make the contractions come quicker. They stopped giving me pitocin and the next morning I was contraciting like crazy and dilatine! yay!  I had already decided that I wasn't going to get an epidural or anything to mange the pain. I wanted to feel everything. Every time a contraction came I just gripped my husbands hand or the bed rail, closed my eyes and breathed easily until the contractions went away. I didn't eat anything or sleep until I had my son. I really didn't think of any of it because I was just too excited about him coming. Labor is hard work but who cares about all the tears and pain when you are handed a this precious child. Back to the subject. After 22 hours of labor and 2 hours of pushing he was finally here! He tore me all the way from the vagina to my rectum. I think the worse part is when they had to sew me up. I did have a episotomy but the baby was so big he tore me anyways. My bundle of joy arrived on Jan. 2. 8lbs 3oz & 22 inches long..    I hope you have a great labor and may God always bless you and your special gift.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	I was induced due to preeclampsia.  The morning I was induced I was 38 weeks and 3cm 80% effaced at +2 station so baby was literally right there.  I was given the pitocin at 10:30 a.m.  Did not feel my first contraction until 3:30 p.m.  They started off feeling like really intense braxton hicks so I didn't think anything of it.  Then at 4 pm, I knew they were real contractions.  I had to breathe to get through them and they were 2minutes apart lasting a minute long.  The doctor came in, checked me I was 4cm, so he broke my water.  After that, the contractions were one right on top of the other.  I barely had time in between them.  During a contraction I would scream for the drugs, but then once the contraction was over I would tell the nurse "nevermind, I'm okay I can do this."  So each time I asked for the drugs she would just wait until the contraction was over to ask me if I really wanted them.  Around 6:30 p.m I got checked again, I was 7 cm.  I was miserable.  My contractions were literally only a minute apart lasting almost 90 seconds long.  I was having the hardest time breathing so they had to give me oxygen.  I started falling asleep after each contraction and at one point I got woken up by a contraction, I got so mad I ripped off my oxygen mask, the blood pressure cuff and got up and told them I had enough and that I was going home.  Then the contraction hit the peak and I laid back down and just focused on breathing.  Then by 8:30 p.m I felt the strongest urge to push.  I thought I had to go to the bathroom, but then the nurse checked me and I was 9.5 cm.  She called the doctor to see if I could start pushing (even though I alraedy was, I couldn't help it.)  The nurse checked me as soon as she got off the phone with the doctor and then she told me to stop pushing and ran back out and called the doctor again.  So I'm trying my hardest to not push, then she comes in and says I am not allowed to push because I was only 85% effaced but I was 10cm.  If I continued pushing I would have ripped my cervix and possibly hurt the baby and myself pretty badly.  So I held back for about an hour and the nurse checked me and I was then 90% effaced.  I couldn't hold back anymore.  I told the nurse that I am pushing and I cannot stop.  So she started asking me if I wanted the epidural.  I told her yes and the epidural lady came (I LOVE that lady).  She kicked my husband out, had me sit at the edge of the bed, I leaned forward, felt a tiny bee sting in my back for a split second, then I felt some kind of grinding sensation in my back (didnt hurt just felt weird) and then laid down.  The lady handed me a button to press anytime I felt pain.  Husband came back in, I fell asleep for a couple of hours, I woke up around 2:15 a.m with this awful pressure, so the nurse checks me and I am finally 100% effaced.  The doctor comes in, they set everything up, turn off the epidural then I start feeling contractions again so I know when to push.  I started pushing at 2:30 a.m, my son was born at 3:05 a.m. 7lbs 0oz 21 inches long and he had this huge bruise/bump on his head.  You really do forget all about the pain when baby is born.  DOn't worry you'll do great.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Ok...Just to let you know, i went into labor naturally expecting a natural birth. The whole thing ended in c-section...  You never know whats going to happen on the big day!    I was awoken at 4am with strong cramps in my stomach and i ran to the bathroom. I remember vividly sitting on the toilet thinking 'omg what do i do!' lol  I awoke my partner and my mother came round for the support. We timed my contractions and they were 7 minutes apart and lasting for 30 seconds.  I decided to wait it out at home and run a nice warm bath. I stayed in there, topping up the water for 4 hours. By around 8am my contractions were ranging from 3-5 minutes apart and lasting 45seconds to 1minute apart. We decided to go the hospital.    We arrived at the hospital at around 9am. I got undressed and into my gown and strapped up to the machines. Everything seemed fine.  My nurse checked my cervix for dilation and had a worried look. She was 'rooting' up there for at least a minute and as far as i can recall that was the most painful procedure! lol  She finally came to the conclusion that i was 7cm dilated and there was something unusual in my cervix which she first thought was the babies fingers, meaning her hand was on top of her head. 'Great' i thought!  After an ultrasound they discovered they were actually toes in my cervix and that my baby had turned footling breech. They said i would have to deliver by c-section otherwise i could risk my daughters life.  I was terrified...and my partner was too. But we had to go through with it...  So i decided enough with natural..give me the gas! I have to say...amazing!  I got wheeled down to the theatre where they gave me the spinal block...which wasnt that painful, just uncomfortable. I was layed down and they started the procedure. I could feel every sensation..obviously no pain though.  Within 5 minutes i heard my baby cry and my partner shout estatically 'Its a girl!!' (we decided to go the old fashioned way and keep the sex a surprise).  It was the most amazing and emotional day of my life. She was born 10.54am 24th April weighing 7lbs10oz. I named her Mia Grace.  The recovery was tough. The peeing and standing up straight were my biggest obstacles but all was good within 2 weeks.    The bad memories of the birth pretty much disappear after a while and i can honestly say that i wish i could do it all over again :)    My one tip is this...You hear women on here all the time wondering whether they are in labor...My belief is you will definitely know when its time to get to the hospital!    Good luck....have a safe and happy delivery x x|`|h59Bc4wfaa	The only thing I can tell you is: Don't restrict your pushing because you're scared you'll poop on the doctor. They tend to frown on that and start yelling. (I think OBGYNs are the only people in the world that would rather have you poop on them, then not.)|`|UAunAKdtaa	ohh wow well i hope you got to this answer   if you did, here is the naasty  labor was a piece of cake cuz they injected me with morphine  i remember looking at a monitor and laughing and saying hey guys look im having a contraction! no pain. but afterwards it got too late tot get another injection cuz i dilated too fast, and then they all screaming around me, "push" how i hate that word! i was barely awake from my morphine cloud and in a soooooo much pain all of a sudden, still not there completely...the baby's head tore up my vagina at the last push since it was very fast and stuff, and after, the nurse pushed on my stomach and out flooded blood and the placenta. painful. and then she stitched me up like some dog or something...it was ugly.then i fell back asleep, still drugged up. the worst was when my husband woke me up and gave me the baby, i looked at him and couldnt hold him i was so weak...he cried and i fell back to sleep. sad. dont get so many morphine injections. they screw you up.|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	i went to my doctor on Friday the 23 of may. i was very uncomfortable, and had been "leaking" slightly.. when he checked my cervix he told me i was dilated to a 2, and was beginning to "thin out" and he gave me the option of being induced that following Monday... the 26th. he informed me that this would be my "window" if we are to realistically achieve a vaginal birth, as my baby was already growing to large for my body.. (her feet were under my rib cage, and her head was already dropping) he told me that the risk of a cesarean section was slightly higher in inductions, but if we didn't induce then i would probably end up having a cesarean anyway. so i said "ok" i went in Monday the 26th at midnight, where i got my IV (it took 6 times before they got it in.) at 2:30 AM the nurse came in and started the pitocin drip. i felt my first contraction at 3 AM. at about 8 AM my dr came in and broke my water to get things moving.. i was still at a 2. the difference in the contractions was noticeable right away.. they were 5 times worse! at 11AM i was in so much pain i couldn't stand it.. i was having intense contractions, they were every 90 seconds, and they lasted 90 seconds, and i was having back labor on top of it. so i asked for the epidural.. wow what a difference! at one point i asked my husband what was touching my foot, and after he lifted the blanket up he laughed and said "your other foot." at about 4:30 my dr. came in (i had made it to a 4) and said that i was not progressing as fast as he would like, and i should consider a cesarean section. i agreed.. after crying for a bit, and so the preparations began. the pitocin was stopped. the epidural was stopped. my husband was instructed to change into a pair of scrubs. i was wheeled out of my room. i went into an elevator, down some hallways and into a very bright clean white room, with lots of tubes and things. it scared me very much. i was still numb from my epidural, so the nurses had to lift me onto the operating table, and hold me up while the anesthesiologist gave me a spinal. i was numb up to my collarbones. my husband was on my left side. and there was a little old lady that kept asking me how i was doing. i heard my dr say "there is the head.. there is a lot of hair.. some pressure here.. (understatement) it's a girl! here she is!" (he held her over the curtain) i said  "shes beautiful!" my dr handed her to a nurse.. (when she cried, i started bawling) they dried her and brought her to me so i could kiss her, and then they handed her to my husband and they went upstairs. i vomited while he put me back together, and then i went to recovery, where i had to wait until i could move my toes before i could go upstairs. they took a picture of my baby and sent it down to me. she was born at 5:03 pm, and i finally got to hold her at around 7:30. i was allergic to some of the medicine in the spinal, so i had to get a benadryl shot. it was completely worth it, and i would do it all again. the hardest parts of recovery for me were walking the first time, and going to the bathroom.. sitting up.. pretty much alot of the next day was hard, but i made it, and now she is 8 months old, and we are very happy! good luck to you!! i hope i helped!!|`|jNErU39iaa	Well - only coz you asked for it!    I was 18 when I had my baby, she is now 6 months old and I am 19.  My daughter was posterior (face UP instead of down) and I couldn't get her out. After 4 hours of pushing (over 48 of labour all up) the 2 midwives and 1 doctor that I had, called in a specialist (at around 11pm!) who finally decided to reach up in to my vagina and turn her the 'right way' up.   I had an episiotomy so they could do this and then she was also suctioned out while I pushed. I had lots of internal stitches as well (from the turning i think.)   I wasn't allowed to have pain relief because my contractions were slowing down instead of speeding up and half the time the sensation to push would disappear. So not only was I denied pain relief, but I was also attached to a hormone drip to try to regulate the contractions.    The placenta was then delivered by 'control cord extraction' which means that they pretty much just pulled it out.  I also suffered a primary post partum hemorrhage which meant I lost more blood than usual and had to have a drip in for about 36 hours.  My hospital stay was 3 night.  But my labour and birth was not normal and I think natural childbirth CAN be a very beautiful thing,unfortunately for me it wasn't - but as soon as i met my beautiful little girl the pain went away =]    Every labour and birth is different and I wish you all the best!|`|wFVLP5l3aa	wow your brave i rathered not know anything and got so freaked out at my antenatel class when they started talking about cesarians and epidurals and then i ended up having to have a c-section lol  my baby was breech and i only found out at my 40 week checkup so my doc booked me in for a c-section the next morning first thing in the morning  they put a bung in my hand (verry painfull) then took me into surgery to prep me. this consisted of making me bend foward sitting up so they could see my spine clearly then giving me a local anestic needle in my lower spine to numb it  then they did the spinal block injection it wasnt painfull exactly but it was a lot of pressure and scared me because im verryphoic of needles.  they then layd me down and my bosy started to go numb and tingly   they then made sure the injection worked y putting an ice block against my skin all down my body and feet making sure i couldnt feel the cold but i could still feel pressure like pins and needles totaly normal   after that it was pretty quick they draped me bought my partner in cut me open pulled my son out and sewed me back up. but it was a verry cold and scary birth.  also after my son was out i got to hold him for a minute then they took him and my partner away leaving me all alone while they sewed me up.  i also had to go to recovery for over an hour all alone to make sure everything went ok and all i wanted was my baby    it was worth going through this to get my son but its not something i ever want to repeat again if i haveanother baby im verry determed to have a natural birth    good luck with your pregnancy and labour|`|4UwbvwFoaa	Im 18 years old and I was induced and feel asleep in the hospital and woke up at 2:32am and thought i had wet the bed but turns out i was in labor! my boyfriend freakd out and ran and yelled for the doctor 20 minutes later my baby boy was in my arms. I had him natural i thought i would need an epidural but lucky me i didnt and im glad i didnt.    I FORGOT TO MENTION   he tore me up and i had to get sewn it hurt like hell i didnt really fell when he was coming out but man did getting them stich thingys hurt|`|AQn5sTXraa	First of all, congratulations! I can tell you about a C-section, but not vaginal birth.    I have one child and had an emergency C-section due to preeclampsia. My daughter was delivered 7 weeks early. They did try to induce with a drug but her heart rate was dropping with contractions so a C-section it was. I too was worried about all of it. I hated (and I mean hated) the idea of a C-section. I am terrified of needles, (the IV was not a pleasant experience for me) and the thought of being cut open while awake was beyond terrifying. I will tell you this: You will get through it, if only because you have to. You are capable of amazing things when given no other choice. They gave me the option of completely going under for the C-section but my husband would not have been able to be present. I do feel cheated sometimes out of the vaginal delivery but it was such a short time and I am so busy now! I was so excited to see my baby I hardly even noticed what was going on. Be prepared for a catheter if you have a C-section, and you will not get to see your baby for a bit after the birth (maybe about 20-30 minutes while they stitch you up)I even asked to see my placenta, which floored my husband. You can go into it as prepared as you want, but be prepared for anything, and most of all, you will surprise yourself at how strong you are. Best of luck.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	its going to be bloody, that's the truth.   you have a possibility of tearing, i did, (3rd degree)  talk to your doctor about ways to prevent this  i wish i had talked to my doctor.. it was never brought up...  i was induced, contractions were back to back, very painful, i got the epidural. if you can take the pain of contractions and the IV, then the epidural is nothing... don't be sceard of it.   you might poop.... don't feel bad if you do... most women do!  yes you are going to look like crap and there will be a lot of people looking at your va-jaja, but you wont care.... i thought i was, but i didn't.... i just wanted my baby out!  i couldn't tell you what it feels like to have a baby come out of you, because i was numb (thank god) and i don't want to ever find out... especially since i tore really bad...     oh let me also add that since i was induced, they wouldn't let me get out of the bed, so every time i had to pee, my fiance had to help me with the bed pan and change my sheets, when i got the epidural, i got a cathador... and when my water broke, it felt like i was peeing myself over and over and over.... and there was nothing i could do about it... it felt horrible... eww... but yeah... the second your baby comes out, you forget everything.... i cried in happiness... its soooo amazing. wow i love my baby more then anything... its great...|`|euo8aFXiaa	I have 4 children. I pooped with 1st but I was also induced with him so my body wasn't ready, but the nurse didn't even say anything, she was great. If you go in to labor on your own your body will clean its self out.  Actually your to busy pushing and hurting to care. I had all of mine natural, and Lamaze works wonders. Even if you get something for pain you should still take the lamaze classes. My longest labor was 5 hours and my shortest was 2. Everyone says "wow I wish that was me" but really it sucked. with a long labor you have some time to adjust to the pain, with short labors its 1 contraction after another. you will forget the pain once you see the baby. However, the Dr. will push on your belly to expel the after birth and then a little later to get you uterus back to size and break up any blood clots. That hurts a bit. I don't know if they do that with a c section, I never had one, thank God !! your belly will look like jello for about a week after, but if you nurse it helps to get you back to normal quicker. Plus its good for the baby. Good luck, and remember no matter how you get there the end result is a baby. If the Dr. says you need a c section because of failure to progress, its not your fault. oh 1 more thing about the pooping thing, when your pushing it will feel like you have to go but 9/10 times its just the baby coming down the birth canal. I was scared about that too my first time. But they see it every day, so don't sweat it. Once again good luck !!  -----   to help with tearing rub 100% virgin olive oil on the skin between your vagina and rectum. start about a month before your due date and do it at least once a day, 2 or 3 would be better. just make sure to wash your hands before ( and after ) and use a cotton ball or something (its eaiser that way) I was cut with my first 1 and yeah the stiches hurt, and then I produced a lot of scar tissue so at my 6 week check up the Dr. used silver nitrate ( I think) to  "burn" the scar off OMG did that hurt.|`|bQTATDTyaa	First of all, there are lots of awesome birth stories and videos online, I watched and read as much as I could too.    My labor started up slowly on Monday morning with very mild back pain off about every 15 minutes. That lasted until about midnight when they picked up with more intensity and 8-10 minutes apart.    At 1:30 am I had the bloody show, at 2:30 am I called my husband from work with contractions every 5 minutes. He came home, and we ran to the grocery store for food (of course the one day I had nothing to eat in the house), the clerk thought I was crazy carrying a stop watch around and stopping mid sentence to breathe, or he was worried I was dropping the baby then.    Got home, and tried to nap balled up on the floor although my mother kept calling until I fussed at her to let me sleep. Woke up a couple of hours later with contractions 5 minutes apart still but longer in length. About 7 I checked myself and was only a few centimeters dialated.    I couldn't sleep or lay down anymore so I went outside at 7am and walked for about 2 hours. At 10am I had been pacing and talking on the phone but couldn't focus to talk anymore so I tossed the phone to my husband mid-conversation.    Until 3:10 pm I paced, drank water/juice, and got in and out of the tub. During this period was the hardest because I was hot but when I took off my clothes I was cold so I drug around a light sheet and kept turning the fan off and on. I also couldn't eat but forced myself to nibble a energy bar and forced liquids so I wouldn't dehydrate. It hurt to sit or lay, and I didn't want my husband to talk or make noise or touch me unless I wanted him to. He put pressure on my back during some contractions. I was sooo tired but couldn't even relax in the tub or shower so I just had to keep moving to be remotely comfortable. I also threw up 3 times in this period, I kept thinking it was transition but labor didn't pick up or change until later. About 1 pm I checked my cervix and I could feel the water bag and head but I wasn't fully dialated.    At 3:10pm I hit transition, I threw up, and my water broke on the kitchen floor at the same time. My husband made me take an Iron tablet since I couldn't keep down food, and I took a dropper full of Vodka because I was so exhausted and needed some relief. That relaxed my contractions for about 20 minutes and I sat backwards on the toilet and slept for that time.     My contractions picked back up so I checked my cervix and I felt the head fully. I decided I wanted to hop in the tub at that point because I could finally sit comfortably because he had dropped enough.    From 3:30-7ish I just felt drunk, I wasn't, just in a zone I guess. I could feel the contractions but I didn't hurt, I seemed in another world. I did want my husband to pour warm water over me though, so he kept having to heat up pots (because our hot water ran out for awhile), and he was running up and down stairs to bring me plenty of hot water.    At about 6-6:30pm I kicked him out of the bathroom because he was tapping his foot from impatience. At this point I started to talk to the baby and told him it was time to come out, every contraction I would give him encouragement (and myself because I knew he was almost there I just needed a little extra push).    At 7:10pm my husband heard me grunting and making different noises so he knew it was time, and I remember hearing him get out of his chair and run upstairs. I had stood up because the baby was crowning and I felt like I needed to stand. I had 5 pushing contractions and I breathed through 3 of them, lightly pushed through the 4th, and really pushed for the 5th. I should have waited 1 more to puch and in my head I knew that but I didn't listen to myself and torn very slightly (didn't even get stiched and it healed just fine).    He came out screaming, and I sat down in the tub and took him, and covered him with a towel. He pooped on me a minute later, then he started nursing. As soon as I had him my husband called my mom and was laughing while he was screaming but I didn't care I was in a zone and couldn't take my eyes off of him.    I had the placenta 5 minutes later, and my husband quickly cut a few pieces off of it and made me a fruit smoothie with it to drink because I was a little light headed and lost a little too much blood.    I felt much better, and a coworker of my husband brought dinner about an hour later, right after we finished cleaning up.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Okay, my daughter was 6days late so I was induced. My BP went up really high and my daughter's heart rate kept going down a lot. They gave me an epidural to see if that'd help and just encase I needed a Csection. When I got the epidural the nurse stood infront of me so I could hold on to her. It wasn't that bad though. I just felt a weird feeling like a muscle spasm for a second.      It all was better for the most part, but her heart rate did go down every once in a while, but I guess they were just watching it and they had me lie on my left side to help and I had to wear an oxygen mask.     About 18hrs after they first started my induction they broke my water and it was brown so they said they'd have to take her over to be checked out so I wouldn't get to hold her right away. Just to make sure she didn't swallow maconiam.      Pretty much exactly 24hrs after my labor had started it was time to push. In the room was: my husband, his mom, my sister, my aunt, and my bestfriend. Obviously a few nurses and my doctor and one other doctor. Also the NNICU was there to check out the baby. I really didn't push long at all. It was very easy for me except for my husband making me laugh some of the time. She came out and was fine, but she ripped me very baddly....third degree deep and long to my anis. She was 8lbs 8ozs, 21in long.   The next day I had to have 2pts of blood transfused and 2pts more the day after that b/c I lost so much blood from her ripping me. My husband said it was seriously a whole trashbag full. I was in a lot of pain from her ripping me and couldn't pee when I needed to so they had to keep the catheder in me, but when they was trying to get it in my urethra they couldn't b/c I was so swollen so it kept feeling they were going to rip me all over again. I had a very painful himroid...they didn't have to give me anything. I just kept the icepacks they give you on both my vagina and bottum...it really helped!      Oh, and you might go to the bathroom during pushing. I did and didn't even know it until my husband told me a few days later. It's imbarrassing to me, but it happens and I got over it.      All the pain was worth it and I'm willing to go threw it again and hopefully next time I can try to go longer without the epidural.     I hope it wasn't TMI, but you asked. Lol!|`|1Q0dAOffaa	I began contractions at 4:14am on a Friday morning.  I woke up feeling like I had an upset stomach.  ( mind you my feet and legs were tightly swollen the last month which goes down immediately after childbirth)  I got into the bathtub for a while.  I then called my dr. and she said to come when the office opened.  I went and she checked to see if I was dialated ( I was due in 3 days).  That hurt so bad it took my breath!!!!  She hooked me up to a monitor and wrote a diagnosis of false labor.  (wrong!!!)  She gave me Darvocett and Ambien to go home and rest.  Neither worked.  I went home and was just completely irritated the rest of the day. Could not get comfortable at all.  I started writing down the times of each contraction.  When they started getting 10 mins. apart, I departed for the hospital.  By the time we started down the road, the contractions were driving me mad.  I mean mad where you would do anything for someone to knock you in the head with a brick!!!!!!  My labor was in my back.  It felt like we were going so slow to get there.  I got there and when I signed in, I could not sit down or do anything but stand there and moan.  It took there forever to take me back there.  After 20 mins. I was back to be checked out.  I was starting to cry with the pain and still had to be checked for dialation.  I thought to myself, "I cannot believe I have put myself in this God-awful situation and I do not know when it will end".  I still was only dialated to a 1.  My Dr. was called and they really wanted to send my home.  ( Too many friends I know were send home only to return to hospital about the deliver and were not able to get pain meds.)  My mother told them we were not going anywhere as she cried watching me cry.  They gave me an IV and I was put into a room.  Seems as the Dr. got there quick and they gave me a shot of Nubain for pain which just dulls the pain.  Thankfully, I got an epidural when I was dialated 4cm.  The epidural was hard to insert  as I could not keep still with the contractions. My epidural (does not work this way for everyone) made me 100% pain free within 5 minutes.  I was ready to get something to eat and go home by then.  I had a little anxiety about the epidural as just not being able to move from the waist down was something I did not like. Dr. went in and broke my water (she said was already broken but I did not remember that happening) and put a monitor on the babies head.  She also inserted a urinary catheter and used a cervidil insert to help with the dialation/effacement. I was told to go to sleep ( it was about 11pm)  I could not go to sleep of course.  Around 330am, they kept coming in to tell me to turn on my left side as the babys heartbeat kept going down and gave me oxygen.  All of a sudden, around 4am, they came in and said they were gonna do an emergency c-section.  I was scared to death!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They wheeled me in the operating room I know within2 mins.  I remember so clearly everyone standing there ready and prepared to start the c-section immediately.  I was put onto a operating table and they gave me some extra epidural meds.  A side effect of epidural is shivering.  I was not cold but just shivered really bad.  By this point I really could not move anything on my body.  It felt as though my eyes were going to shut and I was going to pass out.  I fought to keep my eyes open.  I could see them in the mirror above my body getting my tummy prepped.  They put a sheet up though so I could not see a thing.  Dr. told me when he was cutting.  I could not feel pain but a painless pressure as I could also feel my body being pushed and moved a bit.  I heard the doctor say she was out but I did not hear a cry. Dr. stated her cord was wrapped twice around her right foot.  I finally heard her cry and when I did I basically passed out/went to sleep.  I was woken up to see her but I told them I was too tired.  (  I know, I know, but I was just glad she was alive and now I could rest!!)         I was put on a pain pump ( I was too tired to push the button to get the meds like I needed them) that had ?? (can't remember) in it and I would just doze in and out of sleep.  Even with the strong pain meds, I still felt the pain of the incision.  They came in and took out the epidural which make a weird tingling in my back when they did it. Everytime I opened my eyes, the nurse was in there pushing HARD on my stomach massaging and measuring my uterus to make sure it was clamping shut the arteries and to make sure if was shrinking.  That really hurt some kind of awful.. They kept me on the pump for 1 day and then took me off that and took out the urinary catheter.  Afterwards, I took 2 percocet and 2 ibuprofen every 8 hours which did not touch the pain.  It would hurt so bad to get up and go to the potty that when I did, I would pee myself before getting there.  Needless to say, I have 1 child and that is my limit.  Good Luck, Lisa Anymore questions, email me @venus698u@yahoo.com|`|70Z4DJOcaa	My labour started on a saturday afternoon, felt like mild period pain. At first i didnt know if i was in labour or not, by sunday morning i knew i was definately in labour, pains were getting way worse and were obviously contractions. i was always scared i wouldnt know but trust me, you will know!! so i went to the hospital, but my contractions were irregular so they sent me home.... by the next morning the same was still happening so i went back, my contractions were still irregular and i had only dilated 2cms so they gave me sleeping pills and pain killers and sent me home to sleep... i didnt sleep haha pain was so bad, so next morning i went back, they stretched my cervix then i dilated 5cms, then after that the contractions were REALLY painful to the point i was screaming... so they put me in the spa, didnt really helped... was hard to get comfortable!! so i hopped out and sat over a chair and lent on the bed.... pain was bad so i had the gas (doesnt do much but takes your mind off it)... i then went into the shower and pain got too much so hopped back onto the bed, they gave me a pethadine shot which was excellent!! my eyes were rolling in the back of my head and i was actually having a good time lol when i got off the bed there was a blob of brown mucas stuff which was my plug - it was way bigger than i expected and was so gross!! i was in the shower when the urge to push started, felt like i needed to poo... was pushing so hard, so shame cause everytime i pushed a little bit of poo came out and between contractions they wiped my bum with a wipe!! my waters broke and it was the biggest gush of water! then i was on the bed again to push, thats the worst bit... pushing!! feels like a bowling ball is stuck in your hooha... when the baby is close to coming out it burns and stings like nothing youve ever felt before!! but before i knew it i had a screaming baby on my chest.... the whole experience was a blur! then it took 15mins to push out the placenta, i didnt look at it cause i knew it would look gross! then after all that they push on your belly and heaps of blood comes out!! but its all a relief cause you know its over!|`|vsFJZRkGaa	congratulations on your pregnancy!  i hope you have a labour like mine -- it was great!    i was 37wks pregnant and i'd spent all day cleaning my house so i could have a "week off" from cleaning the next week before i was scheduled to be induced. (i was scheduled to be induced two weeks early because i had gestational diabetes and high blood pressure).  and my husband and i stayed up real late on purpose because we wanted a nice Saturday sleep in the next day.  an hour after i went to bed (about 1am) - i woke up, went to the loo and my waters broke. i felt just like doing a wee... but i didn't end!! it just kept going.. and going.. and going...!! so i padded up and went back to bed and told hubby "my waters breaking" and went back to sleep determined to get some sleep before labour started.  my husband rang the hospital despite me begging him not to tell anyone so i could keep sleeping, and they told us to come straight in!! DAMN!!    so i packed some bags, went to the store and bought a can of coke because all i wanted was my baby and a can of coke!! considering gestational diabetes meant i couldnt have soft drink for the last 6mths i was really hanging out for it ha ha    i got to the hospital and my contractions were mild and i was able to sleep through them no worries at all. my husband slept on the chair and the staff checked on us every 4hrs.    by the next morning my contractions were still mild but the pressure made me wee with every contraction! so i'd sleep, wake up, have a contraction/wee and then go back to bed and go to sleep again. this was when they were about 10 minutes apart.    The nurse did an internal to see if anything was happening, she thought i'd be able to go home as my contractions weren't painful yet - but i was 9cm dialated!   internals are uncomfortable - she uses her fingers to go in and feel what position the baby is in - it doesn't hurt but its weird. more odd then a papsmear, but hey.. you get rewarded by finding out how well your labour is going, what position your baby is in and then you get some drugs! well worth the discomfort i say!    the pethadine helped me labour progress but since it had been over 12hrs since my water broke i had to have a needle of antibiotics to make sure i didn't get an infection. the needle hurt way worse then the contractions!  so then i had a dead leg (felt heavy and sore in the thigh muscle) and still had mild contractions about every 5minutes or so.  the contractions didn't bother me much at all - they hurt less then a stomach virus.    i tried to have a shower to see if that would make things feel nice.. but it didn't do anything for me. it just made my husband get a bit frisky which was funny.    i tried to have a snack, but wasn't hungry.     i stood at the bed, with my head on the mattress (and bum in the air) and rocked while massaging/putting pressure on my hips/bum/lower back. it really helped with the contractions!    then i went to have a bowel motion in the bathroom and while i was busy in there i got the "need to push" feeling. strange... oh well.. so i finished up and then i felt like i needed to go again!!  and again! and again!  hmmmm...   my husband asked if i was alright and i told him what was happening - he recognised it as the pushing stage whereas i just figured i needed a good poo!! ha ha!  it wasn't hurting, but it there was pressure down there.    my husband called the midwife who raced me off to the birthing room.  i refused to get on the bed because i needed to wee again!  she kept saying "you are about to give birth to your baby, get off the toilet!" and i'd say "just another wee and i'll be ready for him to come out, i've got plenty of time"    she did another internal to see if he was ready or if i was right and i had plenty of time...   i was wrong!  she raced me to the bed, i laid down and she offered me some gas for the pain.  i sucked on the gas and all that pressure feeling was lifted and i was perfectly comfortable. I started chatting to my husband and to the nurses about all sorts of small talk ha ha ha  she told me when to push, so i did and his head came out.  she asked me to wait and not push, so i didn't, i just kept breathing in the gas and talking and laughing with my husband.  i wasn't in any discomfort.  then she asked me to push again, so i did and it felt like an aquarium bursting!!  my son was born!!  she passed him to me and we had a nice long cuddle and my husband cut his cord and well had a nice time together.    they gave me a needle to help the placenta come out - it was effortless and painless. less effort then passing wind!     she inspected me while i nursed my son, and i had no bruising, no grazes, no tearing, no hemorrhoids, nothing.  i was able to get up and walk immediately after giving birth and felt perfectly fine except for the dead thigh muscle!    afterwards my son slept all night, and i cuddled him inside my nightie all night long just kissing him and loving him. i was so high o|`|AA11795652	I have two kids so two birth stories.  Please feel free to e-mail me with specific questions because I could write a novel on each but I'll try to give a good, honest story focusing on the highlights for each one.    My first was about 38 hours of labor (18 real labor) and two hours of difficult, tiring pushing.  I have strange spacing in my spine which made getting the epidural really difficult.  It took the anesthesiologist about 45 minutes and 9 tries to get the needle in the right spot but it was worth it.  Once the epidural was in, life was great.  At one point, the nurses had said that if I didn't push better, they would have to go to Plan B (aka a c-section) and I said I understand.  The nurse then said, "No, you can do this," and that was enough to get me motivated and pushing better.  Also, when the held a mirror up so I could see my daughter's head crowning, that helped me  push better.  I still had to have a low-pressure vacuum to help get her out and my doctor gave me two episiotomies but I still tore all the way (4th degree tears) and my doctor took 45 minutes to sew me up and she told me she sewed as far as she could reach.  She kept saying sorry the whole time she was stitching me up.  I healed well and don't remember that pain or the healing process anymore so which me led me to child  2.     My second was induced after about 4-6 weeks of him moving from breech to down, back up, and then down again, and was induced before he could move back up again.  I warned the anesthesiologist that the epidural might be difficult and she asked if I still wanted the epidural and I said yes.  It only took her about 15-20 minutes and about 3-4 tries which she thought was still bad but I was glad to get the epidural.  I was only in labor for about 6 hours but contractions came on fast and hard in the beginning before I got the epidural.  I felt tons of pressure even with the epidural, the nurse checked me and said it's time to push even though I was thinking I still had about 2 more hours to go of labor and hadn't told my family at home to come yet.  Three big pushes and my son was out in 7 minutes and my family arrived right after he came out.  I got a little episiotomy and a little tear which had healed but, because I didn't rest enough at home, I re-opened the area and was told by my doctor to stop doing so much.      Big tip:  Walk as much as you can when you get close to your due date.  With  1, I didn't walk that much and when I got to the hospital they wanted to send me home but they let me walk around for 2 hours until I was finally dilated to 3 cm and had back labor and they asked me if I was faking the pain but they finally admitted me.  With  2, walking was the key to getting my son head down again after being breech.  I walked for 3 hours at Disneyland without taking any trams and being so tired afterwards.  Good luck!    Edit:  Here's some more gross stuff:  with  1, I told the nurse I felt sick and before she could get the cup up to mouth, I threw up, and some of it got on her.  I felt so bad but she just laughed it off and cleaned both of us up.  She was so sweet.  With  2, I think I may have had a little poo while pushing but no one told me.  I think it's better that I don't know for sure.  Also, when my doctor had to break my water, I didn't have the epidural yet and I couldn't relax enough for her to reach so another nurse had to come in and push my huge contracting tummy down so my doctor could pop my water and then I felt it leak constantly under me until I got the epidural.  I was soaked underneath me until I could finally feel enough to support my weight and lift my body up so they could change my bedding.
OWReYgV5aa	It's ok to let her cry some and you won't hurt her by chaning her clothes, etc.  I was that way with my first, I was so protective...I didn't want anyone to hold her for fear they may drop her.  I didn't even want anyone standing over her watching her sleep!  It's a normal protective instinct you are feeling.  Just do what makes you feel comfortable, you will adjust to her in time and feel more comfortable with everything.  You're a good mommy!!|`|1Q0dAOffaa	There is no way to spoil a child this young.  She needs you for safety and security.  Do not let her scream and cry alone at this young age.  ( Easier said than done, right)  She is normal. She is still wanting the security of your body, to hear the sound of your heartbeat, etc. Wrap her like that did at the hospital.  Babies that age will cry a bit because they do not like their arms and legs flailing all around.  I thought I would pull my hair out when I first had my daughter!  She is fragile but not gonna break if you change her!  I did not drive unless I needed to because I was afraid of bad drivers.  Take it easy and Good LuCK!  Buy gas drops to try on her also.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I agree with all these moms. They each have good advice.    Don't let your child cry. Console her right away. Make sure the neck and head are supported at all times and that the head isn't pressed or touched roughly in the little soft spot on the top of their head where you can see their heartbeat.  About her not sleeping. Sweetie, they don't sleep much at this point. Think of them more like cat naps taken whenever they feel like it. My daughter slept anywhere from 30min to 2hrs when she was first born. Just make sure to sleep when she does or you won't get any. Later on, her sleep pattern will have longer spans and then you can start trying to regulate it to a nighttime schedule with 2-3 naps during the day. After 6 months she should be set to 1 nap and 1 whole night of rest with maybe one or two wakeups. I was lucky to have my daughter's sleep schedule regulated at 3 months to 1-2 naps and the whole night sleeping with perhaps one wakeup where she drank some milk, was changed, and fell back to sleep.   Good luck and congrats.|`|sAAnquoTaa	They're a lot tougher than you'd think...trust me.|`|AA12090038	I was never a big fan of letting infants cry...they're crying for a reason...toddlers are different when it comes to crying...they can tell you why they are...toddlers usually do it for the reason they're not getting their own way. Infants cry...because they're hungry, gas, dirty and so on...so at that age don't ignore the cry. It's okay to drive with her...as long as you have her buckled in right..if you want to put your mind to rest...go to the local hospital, firehouse or police station and they can check if you properly have the car seat in the car. her head is not going to fall off you take her shirt off...take it off like you would do yourself...just take it easy|`|n6XYYyoLaa	that young, the only way she would be crying is in my arms; sometimes they need mom , not want, need....they are vulnerable, in a scary new place, and insecure without mommy; some even say that they don't see themselves as separate ppl for quite some time...don't let her cry; she just needs some love if other needs are met.......|`|pXSKSS3daa	She's not THAT fragile. I know it's kind of nerve wracking in the beginning but she'll be fine.    Your mom is silly. You cannot spoil a baby, especially one being ONLY 3 weeks old. And you certainly do not leave her to "cry and cry". No way. At 3 weeks you cannot expect your baby to have a normal sleeping pattern and she may be more awake at night than during the day. That is NORMAL. She'll work her sleep schedule out in due time, on her own. Just don't leave her to cry at this age because she doesn't understand WHY you'd be doing so.    Right now the main things are food and love. As long as her belly is full and you're comforting her she'll excell.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	There is no way possible that a baby could ever be spoiled! You love her and you are just trying to show it. Keep on loving her like crazy! they are a blessing to have.     If you have tried everything you can and she still is crying and won't sleep she might be colic. Don't take my advice...call the doctor and see what they say. Your pediatrician should have an emergency line that you can get a hold of them if you really think something is wrong. Just be calm.|`|zwctZ812aa	They're not that fragile, your baby will be okay.  Obviously don't start tossing her around or anything, but you're fine doing every day activities with her.  The crying it out method is controversial, I personally do not agree with it at all.  I never let my son just cry if all of his needs are met...wanting to be loved is a need too and he just wants to be close to me.  I'm more than happy to facilitate that need.  You can't spoil a 3 week old baby...crying is her only way of communicating with you.  It is normal for her to not be sleeping all that well.  You have to give up your own sleep in the beginning...it will get better, just keep cuddling and loving her and meeting all of her needs and wants.  It will make her feel secure and trust you.|`|UAunAKdtaa	haha i know what you mean. my son was born weighing in at grand 4 lbs 10 ozs...scared me to even look at him, mind you drive him in a car on a bumpy road! nothing fit him he was way too small! when i was still in a hospital with him i was scared to pick him up i might break something haha. a nurse came in and said, "this is how you burp him after he eats" she grabbed him (not so roughly, but to me it was a horror show), she sort of even sat him up, put him on her shoulder, and started patting his back , after which a miraculous little burp came out! that gesture gave me courage. babies are pretty flexible. at about 2 weeks old my little one tried lifting his head already! so dont worry about a thing, just be gentle, give her baths and dont be scared.im a first time mom too, and happy to report that my 19 month old is a tremendous little brat that gets himself in all sorts of troubles. enjoy your baby. she is all forgiving at this point. she will cry for anything, and that doesnt make you a bad mom, and you're not spoiling her. she's just a little baby and needs every second of attention you can give her. sometimes she will cry just to cry. try massaging her back gently to help her sleep, or sing to her while holding her in your arms. and remember that a mommy kiss can cure any little pain!|`|2LKABDPzaa	Congratulations new mom. Newborn babies are fragile but they're also pretty tough. The main thing you need to really protect is their neck and their head, especially the soft part at the front. Don't be scared to change her. Babies love having you touch them, skin to skin. If you don't need to go anywhere, then stay home with your baby. I didn't go anywhere the first month with my baby, not because of being scared, but because of family traditions (couldn't leave the house for a month!). It is ok to let your baby cry but tend to her as soon as you can. It looks like you're doing the right things to try to soothe her. Also, check to see if she is too hot or too cold, that can make her cry too. You can also sing/rock her to sleep. Play with her during the day so that she can sleep better at night. A nice relaxing bath before bed time might also help. Babies at 3 weeks are growing really fast, so she could just be cluster feeding, meaning that she's eating and eating very often. Good luck.|`|ZDMhqzBYaa	no need to worrey about it at all she is still small and it is very normal that babys cry a lot and wont sleep.you need to waite at least for 2 months so that your baby will start observing things and you can entertain baby whie crying.ya when you feed her make shour that she is feeded properely un till she does not feel ungeary do not give any thing other that( like water etc un till unless she is 3 months old.)you milk this is the best for kids when ever she cry feed her some kids do not drink once they keep asking very offen.so dont worrey but allways feed baby both the sides.
OVj5ysDAaa	Yes, it is normal. They are dried out. Don't wash your breasts with soap when you are bathing, just rinse with warm water. Avoid hot water, as it may dry them out more. Apply Lansinoh to your nipples to help with the dryness and prevent cracking when the baby comes and starts to nurse.    Lansinoh is sold at Target, Babies R US, and WalMart. It is a natural lotion, without harmful chemicals. Be careful what lotions you apply to the nipples as the skin absorbs chemicals, and you don't want to be applying much other than Lansinoh if you breastfeed, so the baby isn't ingesting anything harmful.    Oh, and the pulling and "getting them ready for breastfeeding" advice? Torture. Don't do it. It can't be done enough to really help, (Unless you have 3 or more hours a day to devote to nipple torture) and they will still hurt in the end, regardless.  Good luck!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Yes it is normal.  You need to pull on them(nipples) and toughen them up to get them ready for nursing.  Sounds weird I know, but its true.  This will help make nursing not as painful.  The itchiness, is really just your body getting ready for what is close at hand.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	As long as they are not damaged from scratching, diluted witch hazel and also ice helps so much.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	LOL at wanting to rip them off! But seriously, they are probably just really dry and since they are more sensitive than usual, this can be really bothersome. I'd use more lotion/cream in that area. If they still itch you can try some hydrocortisone cream (Cortaid) which is safe to use during pregnancy and relieves itching.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	yes I had that problem when I was pregnant and still do at times   My daughter is 6 months and I am breast feeding. The breast feeding gives me the biggest relief. But I have to agree that creams work good too. AND a good tug at the nipple sometimes shocks it hahaha sounds terrible but it worked for me.|`|AA11840819	Completely normal and you are right they do itch right before your baby is ready to be born.  I put cool washcloths on mine then put some lotion on.  Make sure your bras are large enough since breasts are normally getting larger.  Trying to make sure you do not get too hot helps also.|`|7pAeHKldaa	ooh girl i have been having nipple problems since just about the first second i found out i was pregnant.  i am starting to have paniced thoughts about how bad my life will be after pregnancy if they NEVER stop hurting and itching.  i dont remember what it is like to NOT have boob problems.  i have no remedy that has helped me significantly, but lanolin helped a little for a few minutes.  you are not alone, if that is the only thing that helps :-) hang in there! we both only have 5 weeks to go!
k6XRVeJxaa	In tv shows they always make them fat ;p    OH BEHAVIOR! Oops, ummm    - Cocky  - Selfish  - Mean  - Greedy|`|sKmQVwQMaa	mean, cocky, greedy, spiteful, whiny, insulting, selfish, insecure.|`|uoQiQrnSaa	annoying.  mean.  low self esteem.
uqVAk2pMaa	at 7 months my baby came down with a huge stomach flu and would throw up many things.  the food could also not be sitting well in his stomach.  since it seems like your preparing the food from your home instead of the canned baby food maybe check out what is in the food.  sometimes chemicals end up in the foods that we eat which arent healthy for the baby.  i couldnt breast feed but i do know that at 6 months of age your supposed to already be putting your baby on solids-- breast fed or not.  it could also be if your giving it to him in large quanitities hes not ready for.    if he continues to throw up take him to the doctor and he could tell you better with whats going on.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you need to take  him to the doc right away and have them find out why he is throwing up! he can't maintain his weight that way, much less gain...that is not normal....please take him in immediately....|`|UAunAKdtaa	he may be intolerant to stuff you give him. listen dont worry, my baby ate only cereal until he was about 10 months old. some babies have very sensitive tummies, and throwing up just means his body isnt liking what its getting. no boiled eggs, maybe too much protein since hes still on breast milk and formula. no chicken soup, if you give him that just give the broth (the water). Milky, calm foods are excellent for him at this stage. cool down and just take it one food at a time. if you really wanna feed him something else, try boiling a carrot, then add water to it in the blender and blend until its very very watery. carrots seem to do good with little ones. also pears are awesome, so good job. no hard foods, chicken soup is so 3rd stage! enjoy your little baby, dont feed him a lot, remember his tummy is just about the size of the egg! my kid is now 19 months...cant even believe how fast they grow. take your time!|`|Tebw0VOdaa	I can understand your worry, I am a first time mom too! If I were you I would stick to the cereal and beginner baby food for now. With my daughter ( she is now 13 months) I really went slow with her. I didn't give her eggs or meat until she was closer to a year, there digestive systems just can't handle it yet.  Here is a great feeding chart!  http://www.babyzone.com/baby/nutrition-c...
tXlvg1ahaa	Try to not jump straight in to the sack at first.  Try to do happy things with each other while cuddling.  Let him use his hands, or fingers on you and you do the same.  Later on, when you feel like letting him inside, you do that part but if your Hymen is still in tact, that may be a rather painful experience.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Painful. and awkward.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	For me it was painful, felt wired, and VERY awkward..(even though i was dating the guy for 2 years before we had sex..and he had already seen me naked before that)|`|rsYbDHWRaa	uhm your 14. dont have sex.|`|ZcTW0fY2aa	I agree with the Broken Wings chick.

To be honest i never enjoyed it until like my 5th time (same guy)     some r lucky an never bleed or feel pain.

Be patient|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	Wait until your 18 or older.  I'm 15 and I think it is so weird for anyone this age to be having sex. I think it would be better if you are older and know how to handle the situation better. YEah but that's just my opinion.
pXSKSS3daa	Oh, Hon, parenting is all about learning as we go. You're not the world's worst mother, I'm sure of that. You're just a new one and we've all made mistakes when it's come to our little ones. Rest assured your baby still loves you.    A good rule of thumb is to multiply what your baby weighs by 2.5 to see approximately how many oz. of formula he needs in a 24 hour period. So, say your baby weighs 10 lbs. right now. 10x2.5=25 oz. At that age my son was eating about every 2-3 hours, too, and it was around 5 oz. or so.    I also check hunger as a first sign of what could be wrong when my son is crying. Just take this as a lesson learned and go forward. You could beat yourself up over it but there is absolutely no point in doing so. You're human, you made a mistake, and you fixed it.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Awww you poor old sausage you!  You are not a bad Mum.  The fact that you researched it and found out what he needs shows you are a great Mum!  Don't feel horrible - we are only human and everything with parenting is trial and error.  Keep up the good work.|`|1VPFZEZAaa	You did answer to his needs you didn't let the crying continue, you looked it up seen what was wrong, you did nothing wrong, if you would have just sat there and did nothing you would have been doing something wrong. And it's okay, you're a first time mother, don't be so hard on yourself, we all make mistakes, and you fixed your mistake, and everythings better now.    so don't feel like the worst mother in the world   =/    by the way congratulations, on being a mother |`|zwctZ812aa	You're just a new mom, not the worst mom in the world, try not to beat yourself up.  You know now, and will give him the food the he needs.  Babies don't come with an instruction manual, we only do the best we can! You might try getting a book or something to consult...I love What to Expect the First Year.  Or coming on here and reading everyone else's questions and all the answers has also been very helpful for me.  I have learned a ton about parenting and caring for a newborn.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	You're not the worse mom and there's no such thing as the "Perfect Mom" so don't beat yourself over it. Babies cry as their way of communication and you realized that your son needed more formula and this happens to most first time parents like myself.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	You should be seeing a pediatrician or child health nurse and having your baby weighed every week at this age. That way the doctors/nurses can also ensure that your baby is being fed correctly and that the baby isn't having any problems etc. Your baby should be having his 6 week checkup now. You also need guidance to work out why your baby is crying (eg is he hungry, cold, wet etc). Please seek help. I'm not going to say "aww it's ok, you're a good mommy". I'd rather be more pro-active. If there is a problem, be a responsible mother (which I'm sure you are) and seek help,  Good luck.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Don't feel bad.  No one tells you what you're supposed to do, and babies don't come with manuals.  Now you know, and you can use your information to take the best care of your son that you can.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	its ok! he's fine. plus, don't go by what the internet says. go by what your baby wants. it is very difficult to tell what the baby wants at his age. dont feel bad, i was the same way. i was so paranoid that i was not doing things right when my son was first born. but dont worry, he'll be just fine and it will get easier to figure out what he wants as he gets older. just hang in there and keep doing your best, you will both be fine :)|`|8CPH9l0vaa	Awe sweetie! It's okay... he's your first baby and a lot of new mommy's make small mistakes like this. You realized your mistake and you've fixed it. He is fine, and all is well. It's okay! You aren't a bad mommy at all! You would have been a bad mommy if you knew better but still didn't feed him, but now you know and you are feeding him the proper amount! It will be okay.. just remember that no new mommy is perfect. You are a wonderful mommy I'm sure, and you'll only get better as the days go. Best wishes for you and your new baby.|`|ffJfKTrHaa	Oh, hon!  You first have to forgive yourself! No one is perfect and you didn't want to hurt him.  You will make many more mistakes with a child before he moves out and makes his own mistakes!      You didn't do it on purpose.  You obviously want to take good care of him, and you will!  You'll learn and he's going to be fine.      Maybe you can meet some other moms and share stories and experiences and learn from them.  Maybe a parenting program nearby would help, too.  Good luck and God bless you and your new baby!!|`|sDie27COaa	Babies need often because they're growing. He might have colic. However you are not a bad mom at all. You're trying the best you can and raising a child can be challenging. Keep up the good work.|`|PwrF9OtWaa	my son max, who has always been a big healthy baby from birth, would only drink four ounces of milk at a time up until he was seven months old. he's now eight months old and he only sometimes drinks more than four ounces at a time!    it's ok.    now you know that when your son cries to make sure and rule out every possible reason he might be crying: hunger, dirty diaper, tired, etc.    your son is healthy, everything is ok.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	aww, no hun don't feel bad or cry. i think you may have the "baby blues" which is normal. you will learn everything as you go! your a good mom! you care!|`|sAAnquoTaa	Awwww! Don't feel bad. As a new mommy you're not expected to know everything and he can't tell you what he needed. At that age my daughter didn't eat a lot so it depends on the baby anyway.     You're an awsome mommy just for loving him so much. Don't forget it.|`|SY8b17Ldaa	your are not the worst mum in the world at least you were feeding him its ok now you have found the problem and are fixing it you and your bub will be fine from now on good luck i hope all works out for you|`|QvoPb2SBaa	aaw... you're not the worst mother in the world. I think the majority of first time mums have felt like you. :) Trust me, I felt so stupid when my son was newborn.

Keep up the good work!|`|AQn5sTXraa	Honey, you figured it out. Give yourself a break.

Im a new mom of a 3 month old im always making sure Im doing the right thing week by week.|`|PpL0o7dGaa	Don't feel bad!!!  Same thing kinda happened to me last weekend. I pumped, so my parents could babysit for me Saturday morning.  Well I pumped a little too much, and when my daughter woke up for her 1am feeding I didn't have enough to satisfy her.  I didn't know why she kept crying, I just thought she was just fighting her sleep because she always fights her sleep.  Anyway, I figured it out hours later.  Poor thing was starving!!!
oF2kOKlnaa	Hey there  This sounds exactly like my situation.  I am exclusively breast feeding my five month old son too and at night the milk goes WAY down.  I pump in the early afternoon and keep it for night.  I have also started my son on rice cereal and a bit of baby fruit.  He showed all the signs of being ready at 5 months and is actually sleeping a bit better.  The doctor was fine with it as was the health nurse.  Some babies are just ready earlier than others.  Good luck!|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	If there is no  history of allergies or eczema in your family... my Dr told me it was no problem. ( I had to wait because of allergies)    My supply is low at night too and I always had to pump and give her a bottle but now I feed her sweet potatoes (at least that is what I started her on this week and it is working great!!) I feed it to her at about 5pm then her last nursed feeding (YAY NO BOTTLE!!) is at 7ish.    I skipped the rice cereal because the Dr said it was just fine.|`|Elxuvon8aa	if he is able to swollow thin amounts of cereal with out choking he is ready for some.|`|xOr67VDiaa	Babies love different tastes, its great if he can hold it in his stomach, and the only way you can find that out, is if you give him food. It's great if he can hold it down with no problems, just give it to him slow and in small amounts. everything should be fine, just don't let him fool you into thinking he wants it all the time, cos just cos they like the taste doesn't mean they need more.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	He's ready for solids, I gave my daughter cereal and baby food at 5 months.|`|2LKABDPzaa	If he's reaching for food and looks interested in eating solids, go for it. You can make cereal or other foods pretty runny at first so that he can get used to the change in texture. Since he's been breast-fed all this time (yay!), he shouldn't have any problem with the different tastes. If he's not into eating yet, have you thought of pumping your milk while your supply is higher and then giving him a bottle in the evening?|`|8CPH9l0vaa	At five months it's okay to start him on baby cereal. Rice, barley or oats. No sweetening it, no adding anything period.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I began fedding my baby rice cereal at 4 1/2 months. She's 6 months now and doing great. when they eat better they are much happier and sleep soooo much better. Now i give my daughter 3 scoops ( the little scoop the comes in the formula) in the morning then in the afternoon and maybe an hour before bed.i started off little bit at a time first it was 1 scoop a day to 2 and so on... i still breastfeed when ever she wants too. but yeah at night she will sleep anywhere from 5-7 hrs if i feed her cereal and then bf.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	You can give them cereal before 6 months. You can start introducing baby food at 4 months if you want. Make sure it's one at a time in case they might be allergic. My doctor told me if you feel he's ready go for it. My son is healthy and a great eater. Ask your pediatrician if you have any concerns.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	hon, this is best asked of your doc; he/she knows your baby well, and knows their weight and such...
382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Having unprotected sex can always help.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	To have unprotected sex of course!|`|DPJRlxOwaa	I'm assuming you're a girl so. Either tell your BF/Fiance'/Husband you want kids. If that doesnt work jump them in the middle of the night, preferably after a long night of drinking. If not that, get a new boyfriend.|`|lAQskxoLaa	have unprotected sex all the time!|`|AA11703652	Okay. I'll give you the TRUE secret...you need to have an orgasm.  The contracting of the uterus pulls the semen up to where it can get near the egg.  (If you don't climax during the intercourse, wait til he falls asleep and masturbate to climax.)  Of course this is much more effective if you are ovulating...but shouldn't we all have an orgasm as a result of sex, whether HE does it or not?|`|MzHwklzKaa	Well, what can go wrong will go wrong.  Just listen to God laugh...    Break up with your boyfriend.  The minute you decide you never want to see his sorry face again, you'll fall pregnant, and have to deal with him (custody/child support) for the rest of your life.    Get drunk, have sex with a stranger.  Always works on New Years    Get a promotion at work.  Especially one that will require lots of over time and travel.  You know, the second you find your life ultra busy, with not 1 single second to spare, you'll fall preggers.    Get a new sports car.  No room for the carseat?  Can't you just hear God laughing?
mrYCeWoMaa	my first child i first heard the heart beat at 7 weeks 5 days on ultrasound, and this time i heard it at 6 weeks 3 days by ultrasound as well.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	at 7 weeks at my first OB appointment!|`|KNcZTbqQaa	9 weeks 2 days... I didn't hear it but the woman doing the ultra sound did and showed me the thingy on the screen registering the heartbeat.. I took her word for it ;o)|`|VxKH7KHmaa	I went at 12 weeks and couldn't really hear it.  Then at 15 weeks and could hear it perfectly:)|`|N312jE5Jaa	I was 14 weeks pregnant.|`|R2TnvAbfaa	I think I was around 8.5 or 9 weeks along.|`|irHF6CBPaa	I was 8 weeks|`|6B4sxGsXaa	at my first doctor's app @ 8 weeks. some women its easier and some its harder to find babies heat beat!!|`|MNnHNl4Oaa	My first one I heard at 24 weeks along..I didn't found out until then because I was severely sick.    And the second was 9 weeks :)|`|dNhgIMIPaa	I heard mine at my first ob visit at 13 weeks  The baby's heart beat can be seen on an ultrasound at around 7 weeks, and if you are very slim MAY be heard on a doppler from 9 or 10 weeks.     It is most generally possible to begin to hear the baby's heart beat at the beginning of your second trimester, however sometimes it is possible to hear it a couple of weeks before or after these dates as well. It most likely depends on the size of the baby and how quickly it is growing in each individual person.       You can start to hear the babies heartbeat through ultrasound as soon as 6 weeks into your pregnancy! A doppler can start to pick up a heartbeat at around 10-14 weeks into your pregnancy. A stethoscope can be used to hear the baby's heartbeat late in the pregnancy.        If you have an early scan it can be seen from about 6 weeks. If listening with a doppler and you are very slim sometimes (not always) it can be heard from about 8 weeks.        You may be able to see it on an ultrasound at about 7 weeks but unless you are very thin you won't be able to hear it with a doppler until about 10 weeks, possibly later. Until 12 weeks the uterus is still in the pelvis and the heart is very small and the machine has to be pointed directly at the heart so the sound is reflected, unlike a microphone.|`|UAXHmqgRaa	I was eight weeks. My ob doesn't even see you in her office unless there is a problem until like eight weeks. I have three girls and it was all eight weeks.|`|EOIxLhBxaa	saw 6w heard 10w?|`|wLChaSKfaa	I heard mine at 6 weeks 4 days via ultrasound.|`|QSodlfMraa	16 weeks|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	At my first OB visit at 8 weeks.

kaqPSgTVaa	"Wetness"  is usually just vaginal secretions which are normal to have...You're just a little more "wet" than normal. Not to be crude. That's not a pregnancy sign if that's what you are wondering but you obviously could be as you already know. Cramping is normal as well before you get your period and sometimes around ovulation. That could be an early pregnancy sign but also PMS. NO cramping WILL NOT prevent implantation. Sorry.|`|D0sIVfofaa	play it safe and always carry a condom. even if you don't use it you can give it to a friend. don't risk your kid growing up without a dad.|`|EOIxLhBxaa	cramping has nothing to do with. You can cramp after an orgasm. Wet because it takes awhile for sperm to come out or you have a yeast infection or nothing. Wet is nothing. Just normal ways a body works.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Is the wetness a discharge?  If, so, makes me wonder if you picked up an STD, or maybe getting a infection.  Just watch it and see.  If, symptoms get worse call your doctor and get checked.  Be careful and take care of yourself as I am guessing you are trying to get pregnant. Good luck
vfq04nc1aa	Hi  I knew a lady called that and i think its a classy name.  She was a very classy lady with lots of money so i think that it's quite a posh name.  Good Luck!|`|8CPH9l0vaa	I think it is a beautiful name.|`|tLXD3yOWaa	when i first read it i pronounced it differently and didn't like it  but now that i read the pronunciation i think it's very pretty and posh|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I think its a pretty name|`|NmIYrL1Paa	I don't think so|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I think it's a nice name.|`|Lf3SZbrCaa	That's a Finnish name. Unless your Finnish then NO don't use it. People might think your racist.|`|LgLpJxnwaa	it sounds to muddeld up.  Arilena would be beautiful :)
mrYCeWoMaa	well implantation bleeding usually happens a couple days to a week before you before is due. it's usually pink and really light, and then turns brown, it can usually last 3 to 7 days. and may involve some cramping. If you are thinking that it might be an early period i would wait a few days and if it doesn't pick up, and the flow doesn't become heavier than i would take a test in a couple weeks, to be sure if your pregnant or not.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	After ovulation the egg travels into the uterus and burrows into the lining of the uterus. For some women implantation will cause slight bleeding or spotting. This is called implantation bleeding. This is sometimes confused for an early period.  So you could be pregnant, I'd go get a pregnancy test.
4YJPYqzXaa	No that's just wrong.|`|IkkYOehSaa	no, men don't have milk ducts to produce milk.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	No they cannot.|`|yeYL8Udoaa	no....|`|v9cORzzfaa	We actually can... but we keep it a secret so we don't have to.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Sure...if the Mother uses a breastpump to pump the MOTHERS MILK from HER breasts & put into a bottle.     You're either a troll or really dumb or possibly gay or maybe even a pervert. I hope you're just dumb.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Although rare, yes men have mamary glands and nipples.     Therefore - breastfeeding is entirely possible.     Breasts are mostly fat, not glands, so it doesn't matter whether they have 'breasts' or not, they still have nipples and the glands so they can breastfeed.    I wish people would just google something before they try to answer a question.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	no.|`|1wQeH0hdaa	Nope.. Men dont have the glands that secrete milk...  Now those who gave me thumbs down are either complete idiots or they are completly misguided creatures.. Very sad for those who believe that men can breastfeed..|`|9c639ceb426ad704bf33bb925821b5acaa	i have heard that with the right hormones , yes. and it is Very nutritious once you pick the hairs out|`|20KORDX8aa	NO!|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Yes there have been cases of men being able to produce milk  http://www.unassistedchildbirth.com/misc...    check out this website.    Gee I hate it when people answer questions and they think they know it all and they dont|`|CzBNTeLAaa	Yes, in theory, men can breastfeed. Male breasts have milk ducts, and some mammary tissue. They also have oxytocin and prolactin, the hormones responsible for milk production. There have been reports of men who were able to produce milk through extensive breast and nipple stimulation, but no one knows whether the milk was of the same composition or quality as the kind women produce.    Men can also get breast cancer for the same reasons. They have milk glands and breast tissue, although not as much as women, obviously.    ---------------------------  I wish people would do research before answering questions they know nothing about, and give an answer as if they do. They don't want to take the time to think, "hmm, I wonder, if this may have some truth to it." Then smartly do some research, instead of flat out answering wrongly, and then calling people dumb or a troll. >|`|sAAnquoTaa	Sure if you want to sit and hold the baby up to the muther's breast. Ummmm no they don't have breast...duhhh!     Now you can be breastfed if you get in to that sort of stuff. Lol!|`|0r2uZ4eDaa	Try those breastfeeding bras.|`|xZYS9nDKaa	WTF NO|`|kNLi16C6aa	only if they find a woman willing...and without a hungry baby to look after.|`|24mXv9Claa	heyhey! yesyes! ;)|`|vTGnZsOxaa	O.o No one knows that.|`|Oq4ShXTyaa	as babies we are all woman at first, but then men's hormones (testosterone) stops production of having breast organs and our ovaries/testicles drop from the inside out, skin forms around and the clitoris extends outside of the body instead of being hidden on the inside..... this should explain the question you are asking and the question you are also wondering....  no men cannot breastfeed since there are no organs to lactate milk  men only have nipples since we never finished making the organ for breasts, only the nipple was made|`|3JKe5lr8aa	YES-- men not only have nipples, but they also DO have mammary glands.     Male lactation is most commonly caused by hormonal treatments given to men suffering from prostate cancer. Female hormones are used to slow the production of cancerous prostate tissue, but the same hormones also stimulate the mammary glands. Male-to-female transsexuals may also produce milk owing to the hormones they take to reshape their bodies. It can occasionally be a side-effect of antipsychotic medication. Extreme stress combined with demanding physical activity and a shortage of food has also been known to cause male lactation. The phenomenon occurred in survivors of the liberated Nazi concentration camps after World War II.[1] Some American POWs returning from the Korean and Vietnam Wars also experienced male lactation. The phenomenon has also been observed in isolated cases in other parts of the world.[3]    In Why Is Sex Fun?, Jared Diamond suggests that mechanical stimulation of male breasts, by releasing prolactin, could result in lactation. He also mentions teenage boys lactating after self stimulation of their nipples.[4]|`|n4oOFWGEaa	Technically yes. If a man starts taking estrogen his mammary glands can activate and produce milk. "Of course, the idea isnt entirely crazy. An often-cited claim states that men have mammary glands just like women, so they too should be able to produce breast milk. Such situations are apparently rare, while a more common situation that induces lactation is when men receive a sufficient dose of estrogen as a medical treatment." Please look at my source. It is kinda funny actually.

wziUVyVoaa	I think it would sound better as Matthew Fox. Even though that WILL remind people of the actor, I think it's beautiful and exotic and mysterious. Fox Matthew is a nice name, too, though. I guess it really depends on the last name. I like the idea of having a son named Fox. It's unique and, unlike most unique names, I REALLY don't think he'll get made fun of in school like most people would think. If I went to school with a kid named Fox, we would either all be scared of his "dangerous" name (haha) or he would be the ultimate ladies man because of it. It's cute and I hope you go with it, because I love it!|`|4LbVbJQXaa	i think its a really cool name..but make sure he doesnt have red hair.. i have red hair and my friends call me fox and i dont like it....but the name is really original and pretty neat|`|twzgqHlMaa	I think of the dharma initiative ....other than that, just don't dress the kid in motocross "FOX" gear.... that would be obnoxious.|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Makes me think of Mathew Fox on the LOST series.|`|Elxuvon8aa	do not think Fox is fitting  and Matthew has 2 t's|`|TYl7kmPeaa	ummmm no|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	Sorry but no...Fox is just a bad name not to mention matthew fox the actor|`|8CPH9l0vaa	You want to name your son Fox?

Ob9AZnA4aa	Many girls feel this urge especially when emotionally and psychologically connected to a partner through sex. The idea of a baby seems fathomable to you maybe because you envision the guy you're with to possibly be the father of your child. My ex gf had the same urges as well and it has to do with the strength of your relationship, your own maturity, and the comfort you have of your body. You obviously seem to be mature with your goals in life and just for the fact that you have the decency to spell correctly haha.     Anyway it's not crazy, and with all of the distinct hormones passing through a woman's body throughout their fertile years it makes sense. Some of these hormones urge sex, in turn, to keep the human race going. In terms of natural selection, those not exhibiting this would be slowly removed from the earth since they wouldn't want to have children; moreover, since they don't, they won't have children with the same traits.|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	Your ticker is ticking... or so they say. hahahaha  Don't worry your not running out of time or anything.  I did the same thing. Around 15, 18, 20, 21, 25 (because I thought I was getting old) and then finally we (my husband and I) decided it was right for us to start trying when I was 27. I am so glad that I waited because my life was where I wanted it.    *Having my own life and getting past the party stages.  *Going on vacations and have a nice wedding and honeymoon.  *My husband wanted his career going.   *Buying a house (which we ended up doing when I was pregnant) hahaha  All those things played a part and I am so glad we waited until those were checked off of our list.  Now we can focus all of our energy on baby.      Oh and by the way. That desire you feel will fade then get stronger each time. hahaha|`|sAAnquoTaa	Not crazy at all! It's an awsome thing. It means you'll be a good mommy when you do finally have one.|`|Bge5zjJYaa	start with baby carrots and go from there no reason u should rush into this|`|wqtwzzPeaa	You're probably just maternal.|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	lol i'm 23 and i have a desire to have kids too! i understand what you mean. and i don't even have a boyfriend!|`|z6mbVz8maa	yea, what your boyfriend thinks of it? talk to the father...|`|SOqkJxhUaa	Yep. Normal hormones. They will come and go on you for the next 30 years or so.  Stick to your life plan and you will be fine.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	it is completely normal to have the desire to have children at your age.  i commend you for realizing you should wait.  i went about things backwards... got pregnant, then married, then finished college lol.  let me tell you, it is much more difficult doing things my way!|`|l6EO5pDDaa	its not crazy. us as women have the nature to want to have children and nurture. its just who we are. ive had the same feelings since i was 13. and i figured out its usually round the time that im ovulating i want to have kids. we are women and we were made to bear children.|`|x59uoIpMaa	Sweetie pie, if I was in college GETTING MY LIFE TOGETHER, I would not be having sex.   Look, here you are getting your life together and that's wonderful, but listen. If you are even having sex, theres a chance you can get pregnant. Do you really want to take that chance and interrupt the progress your making in your future career? :(     Be smart. Stop having sex with your boyfriend b/c you will get pregnant.   Not to mention sex will be less important and wonderful once you get married!    You might have a life plan, but life happens! Be smart. Being safe isnt always fool proof. Dont want any kids now? Dont have sex.     As for your desires to have a baby, thats normal. It will go away in time and come back when God truly intends for you to have a baby.|`|3hkCIu78aa	its not crazy for you to plan out your life and have kids be involved. I wish you luck|`|U0b4U827aa	I have my bachelors, a great job (except when it deploys me), a wonderful husband and am 24 years old. I also have a 1 year old daughter who is my world and I would not trade her for anything, but I am very glad I did what I did first. School, life/job, marriage, THEN baby.     I'm not saying a 19 year old couldn't raise a child very well, but you owe it to your future child to be financially stable, especially with today's economy. Just read the financial section of the paper the next time you feel a tug on your uterus.|`|3Cw2JT0yaa	no u aint but raising kids is hard work and stressfull.at 19 your body aint fully developed yet for a baby normally at 24,it is study first get a good job with enough money studying and raising also very very stressfull, then u can provide for ur child as best as posible|`|e86d0dc04b8341bfbc95ea7381d26e5faa	a decision this big clearly shouldn't be made on impulse.  you would want the best for your child, right?  a comfy home, financial security, a father he can count on, etc.    try and take a step back and think that if you bring this baby into the world NOW (as opposed to after getting married and going to college), your life will turn upside down and both you and your baby will be at a disadvantage.    hope that gives you some perspective.  also, try talking about this with an older woman in your life that you really trust - good luck!!|`|afbkHAsaaa	It's good that you have such a strong life plan.    I wouldn't say that it's crazy for you to feel this way but I assure you, no matter when you have a baby, it will be special. You don't want to rush into anything that you are not prepared for. Becoming a parent is a huge thing in someones life and requires a lot of responsibility.     In the end it's up to you but be sure you know that it's no easy thing. I have a 2 and a half year old little girl and there is no way I would trade being a parent for anything. I've definitely had my difficult days and like I said, being a parent isn't as easy as some may think.|`|HPn6MN7Daa	yeah half crazy. just think of all the money you willneed to raise a kid. then you might change your mind.|`|rVs2nfgGaa	You aren't crazy at all!

Women are supposed to reproduce, it's like an instinctual thing to have a desire to have children.  Your life plan sounds great, give it a try.

You know that the urge to want to procreate is nature and natural, and some religions go as far as setting rules as to not over populate?  Yes even five year old girls dream of having a baby.

Maybe just trying to be an acquaintance would help her.(you don't have to be friends but just enough to let her know SOMEONE is out there) Good Luck.|`|HoOL6BiGaa	Just say to her   Lots of people have lots there babies  But Please don't threaten other People that r pregnant  You'll b pregnant again trust me  And if that doesn't work just say to the father Of the baby   And say to him "Can u tell her"    "the mother of the baby" She is threatening everybody pregnant for they babies to die  Surely she love shim so she go by wat he said  Hope this helps:)  Plus it sad for a moth to have lost there first baby so just make her feel better andkeep her safe from doing crzy thing|`|56MmKc5caa	She sounds like she needs attention. She probably wasn't even pregnant.|`|HIn1p4OBaa	i think she's just upset and she'll get over it. don't worry
MQ34YW28aa	I still think your pregnant hun. :) I went through the same experiences that your going through. Probably wait another week or so to take a test, but a box with 3 tests in it though that way if it comes out negative wait another week and take another test. I so hope you are pregnant, you deserve it. You seem to be very sweet!!!|`|AGmiUQR8aa	why don't you go to a clinic or nearest health center in your area and have a check up, maybe your just delayed.it happened to me before but the second time around it happened i was pregnant already. don't be ashamed every woman in this world experiences that|`|k9nLue0Uaa	lol you sound like me when I first got pregnant so I'm not sure what advice to give you besides go get a pregnancy test in a week or two. I was bloated for about 2 months when I first got pregnant now I'm 25 weeks and don't even look big at all :) And my breast murdered me and still do.
1VP9TUVOaa	it's always different. You won't get a great answer here, because everyone is different.

Jo3Ma2NOaa	Im having the same problems....my baby just is way to active at night...i dont work during the day so i just sleep as much as i can during the day...and read a book at night....i either get too bored and pass out read or i have something to do during the night....depending on how the baby is acting|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I wish I could help you out because I'm 31 weeks and in the same boat as you are! At least that means we aren't totally abnormal...haha. Really, I'm thankful I can get any sleep at this point, even if it is in nap form. Actually the only thing that helps me (just a little) is taking a bubble bath before bed. I can usually get a little bit of sleep in at night that way.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I'm 33 weeks & 3 days with my 2nd. Sometimes I have this problem too. I drink like two cups of hot tea, take a shower, and watch sports with my husband lol or a movie. That puts me to sleep and it gets me relaxed. You can also try reading a book or listening to soothing music. Good luck =)|`|6B4sxGsXaa	i knw it sounds terrible but try wear yourself out a bit more during the day or get up earlier, a routine like that has to be broken before baby is born. and i do sympathise with u as im 37 weeks pregnant with 5 other children to chase after and sometimes i'd kill for an afternoon nap lolz....  Good luck|`|qmmu6hv5aa	I'm 36 weeks and am the exact same way...i don't sleep at night, i mean honestly 3 hours a night, the other hours i'm awake trying to get comfortable, going to the bathroom or watching tv. I rely on my naps to get me through my days. The only way I sleep a little more during the night is if i have woken up early that day and don't nap or rest at all..then i maybe get to bed early with some good sleep.     This definitely makes me want the baby more because I know i'm going to be awake with him in the middle of the night, and I wish he was here now so I wasn't just sitting awake alone!|`|ix3pF1I8aa	I know what you mean, I have a 2 year old and a 4 month old and I could never really have a good night of sleep, during the day was easy, but it was always night I had trouble.  When I was pregnant with my last son, I found on a website certain positions to lie down in and how to position your pillows around you...It helped me greatly, hopefully it can help you too.  Good luck with everything and congrats!!
AA11762804	like 5 or 7 weeks     Your period stops or becomes very light.   You may feel nausea or queasiness. Some women vomit. ("Morning sickness" can happen any time of day -- it may help to eat small meals throughout the day, snack on crackers or toast, or drink juice or lemonade.)   Your breasts swell and may be tender.   Your nipples and the area around the nipples (areola) get darker and broader.   You have to urinate more often.   You feel tired.   You may become constipated and have heartburn (Tums may help).   You may have headaches.   You experience mood swings -- feel angry, sad, or happy for no reason.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	On average Morning sickness appears week 6 of pregnancy. But every one is different.    Symptoms can begin from conception. : such as -    Headaches, dizzyness, nausea, cramping, peeing more, bloating,. gases , feeling more tired, soreness of nipples and breast ( i didnt get this until 24 weeks),  All of these because ofhormonal changes.  But on average along with morning sickness at 6 weeks when they usually arrive : it will be most of those. But some ladies never get them.    God Bless x all the best  x|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Depends on the individual woman. Some do,some don't.  A missed period is usually the first symptom.  I would just buy her a pregnancy test. This way you won't have to play detective,you'll just find out.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I didn't throw up until 5 weeks. but i was feeling a bid odd and sometimes nauseous before that. Tired is a very common symptom|`|GHlYbDfJaa	It's different for everybody, but usually around 4-6 weeks.|`|FRE2gov3aa	Every woman is different.    I know someone where she started throwing up around 5 weeks.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	I didn't throw up at all - not compulsively.. I felt more nauseous... So I wouldn't suggest relying on that symptom. Be attentive if she goes to the toilet noticeably more than usual... hey, here is an idea: suggest a pregnancy test? :)|`|08tABbXZaa	that just all depends on the person. i only threw up when i brushed my teeth. that started at about 8weeks. some dont throw up at all
1Q0dAOffaa	You need to ask a professional this.  I really don't think she can.  My mom made me go on Zoloft when I was a teen which made me resent her even more. ( I did finally start taking it like I should)  But in the long term, I felt better.  I doubt they can make you stay in a psych ward if they do not deem you having a problem severe enough for that.  You are only 15, quit doing all that stuff that gets you into trouble.  Take it from someone who did that years ago and as a mother now, I understand how bad I hurt my mother.  She should also understand that this comes with the teen territory.  Of course my mother acted like she was a saint as a teen. LOL  GOod LUck|`|fAcVndo7aa	When it comes to medications for mental illness, even adults sometimes have no choice.  There have been several lawsuits where adults have been forced to take their medications - even while they are committed in mental institutions.  So, yes, in a word, your mom can make you take the pills.  They should be used in conjunction with therapy, which you say she is also making you go to.  Bipolar disorder can be a difficult thing to deal with.  I suggest you tell your doctor about the side effects and have your medications evaluated.  Follow your doctor's advice and your mom's mandate.  If you are deemed a potential danger to yourself or others, you indeed could wind up in a psych ward.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	being bipolar is a medical condition that NEEDS medication,, not love and attention from family..       can she force you to take them.. no. but she and your doctor can have to put in a place where they can force you to take them    tell your doctor that they make you sleepy and maybe can change the dosage..|`|rHhtn7plaa	when you see the therapist tell them about you needing the love and things like that .and stop running off and talking back

My son has 2 sets of identical twins in his class... one who have individual names and individual outfits... the others have very similar names, same haircut, and always wear the same (sometimes in a different color) outfit. The children in his class treat the first set as two individual people, and treat the second set as 1 person with 2 bodies (going so far as to use only one name and not change it when the twin told them they were using the wrong name!)    Do your children a favor and don't use this sort of themed/matchy naming scheme with your children. If you want to link the names, try using names that are an anagram of each other (Aidan and Nadia) or names that have a similar or complementary meaning (Doreen and Matthew both mean "Gift of God")|`|Ya1zZORIaa	Reagan and Tatum  I dk why but I just adore the combination!

I'd go to google, search 'Baby Names' if you already haven't, and you could put the type you want like, 'Gothic Baby Names' and there are some good ones, and they should have the meanings of the name under the name itself.

She needs to go to family court and make someone aware of the situtation and find out what her options are.    The courts will decide if the father should have visitation or if he is unhealthy or dangerous to the baby.    If he is violating the restraining order, she needs to call the police.    How does she take the baby to him if there is a restraining order?

uUeeHL80aa	That's fine. And if anyone is shocked and stunned by this topic you don't know what you are talking about. I have seen 14 year olds dating men in their mid-late twenties. I knew a 13 year old girl who was dating a 23 year old and that was when she just turned 13 they broke up about six weeks before she had her next birthday. 16-17 is pretty much 18 and no one care, but I do agree when you go under 15 and the guys over 18 it sort of makes you go "hmm" Personally I think as long as shes 14 or over it's fine, these days alot of men over eighteen are getting fourteen year olds pregnant even.|`|6L9jJnchaa	No!  Geezus, find someone your own age.  That's statutory rape.|`|EccBqsntaa	No.Its illegal.|`|gG8oyymiaa	Depends on the state your in. 17 is legal consent age here. My bf is 23. I have been with him for 2 years now. When I was 16 I had parental consent though. My mother approved of him. he was a and still is a very good man. Are you with her just for sex? Because if you are I believe that is wrong. Has her parents met you? Is she mature for her age or just one that goes for anything? I say if you get consent from her father then yeah go for it. If you can't then tough luck leave it alone. Hope her father doesn't try to kill ya first tho. Good luck.|`|TgfSqo9maa	No. She won't be an adult until she's 18, and you could be charged for statutory rape.    Kelly|`|ghz5D5iLaa	The legal age of consent in Michigan is 16 years old.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	in michigan i know that 16 is legal age of consent to have sex, but not with someone over 18.

But I mean I lost mine when I was 17 and my boyfriend was 19 and I was in a great relationship. If you both are in love, then its alright. More than like 80%(guess off the top of my head) of girls lose it before they are 18 anyways. Dont trip. Just as long as you both aren't just a FLING, and a real relationship.|`|4WgsBvq1aa	depends where you live. just google it depending where you live to verify the local laws.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	Since the legal age of consent in Michigan is 16, then yes, it is completely legal to have sex.

b7d61d00819e6e79d7e6b03b1e9bfa32aa	Not sure if the same is true in your state but in Ohio you can go to the vital records department and the child's last name can be changed to the fathers last name but both of you have to complete  an Acknowledgment of Paternity form and a Declaration of Paternity form.  The new Birth Certificate does take a while though they tell you 6 months.  In August I got married and we had never added my son's fathers name to the birth certificate so we were going to change his name but when we went to the court house she told us we could do it by adding his name for free.  Oh by the way my son will be 13 in April|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	just go to your courthouse and ask, but your probably going to have to hire a lawyer to help you.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Heres some info, I heard its expensive, dont know personally what somoene else considers expensive.

I5P2bbgWaa	The ONLY reason I clicked on your question is  because I thought the picture you used   is absolutely beautiful!|`|sAhAEC2qaa	honestly at first glance i saw your avatar and it looked to me like a little child kissing a pregnant belly becuz the pic is so tiny. so idk y any 1 would have an issue|`|3QqLYCJCaa	I'm assuming you knew when you posted your new avatar that it would create quite a stir.    As for people posting pictures of their babies drinking from bottles, etc., well, you already answered your own question.  They're bottles.  It's the container that people have difficulty with.  I don't have a problem with breastfeeding at all.  However, you had to know this would cause a commotion.  I find it hard to believe that you're so confused about this.|`|OVj5ysDAaa	I think it's ridiculous that women can post avatars of female bodies in skimpy swimsuits or practically naked, but not of a nursing mom?!    Breastfeeding is very natural, and not offensive to me in the least. I have breastfed 2 children, and while I do think you don't have to show alot of skin and attract attention to yourself or your breasts in the process, I also think breastfeeding should be "tolerated" and not made into such a big deal.|`|P8VoBR0saa	There is nothing offensive about breast feeding, it's the most natural thing in the world.|`|HclKftzAaa	I don't find it offensive. I like boobs. lol. Seriously though. she's adorable, and it reminds me of the fact that i'm growing a baby in me, and that i'll get to BF soon too (i hope). Makes me jealous. lol.    However, i can see how some of the crazies on here would find it offensive 'OMG! there's a BOOB in that picture!!' It's like the people who banned a photograph of two 3 yr olds because they didn't have shirts on- they said it was too sexual. Seriously, if someone can see something sexual in something as innocent as naked 3 yr olds at the beach, or someone BF, there is something wrong with THEM!    I like my pregnant boobs :D But i still don't want to show them off! Lol. does it take long to get comfy BF in front of ppl?    I noticed someone used the word 'tolerated' in their answer. I completely agree that BF should be accepted as a natural thing, and BF moms should be left the hell alone.     But it's so frustrating that we have to use the word tolerated- this implies that there is something wrong with it that ppl have to 'put up with.' you know what i mean? It's more that ppl need to stop being so stupid about it, there's something wrong with the haters, not with us sticking our boobs in our babies mouths!|`|djmu98oUaa	i think it does'nt matter of your childs doing breastfeeding in a pic ... its ok now|`|n3PE2lvDaa	I dont find it offensive at all. There is nothing dirty about breastfeeding a baby. those that think it is dirty need to desexualise themselves. Mothers should be proud of themselves for breastfeeding there is nothing shameful about it.|`|sAAnquoTaa	I can't see it to know, but from what people have told me pics of babies eating are cute.    Edit. Oh okay. From hearing other answers I understand it's of you breastfeeding. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.|`|AA10368053	Its kinda hard to tell what it is unless you really look.

I've seen far worse avatars on here.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think it is of you breastfeeding, big deal. People are just too sensitive.    It's so tiny it's hard to see anything anyways.....I am a little blind though, lol.|`|UAunAKdtaa	i dont find anything wrong with it. a baby is eating. some people find it grossly inappropriate when a woman is breastfeeding in a restaurant...i think those people need to have kids to understand how important it is for you and your baby to breastfeed. argh the haters!!!  keep the photo. complain to yahoo answers!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	OMG that is hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But it's also really really dumb.  I love your picture, and there is nothing wrong with seeing a baby nursing.  :)    That is so ridiculous I may even put one of my own up as my avatar!  LOL!

The build up of stress from trying and worrying whether or not your pregnant and if your doing the right things can cause your hormones to tell your body that it is not ready. the next thing is that it is ok to drink. despite what you might have heard, living your daily life and activites can not hurt you chances of getting pregnant.But bettering them can! Change your diet a bit. eat less of fst food, and more of fruits and good meals. The other is be active. A lot of studies have shown that active females tend to be a little more fertile due to there increased energy and estrogen. Yet the one hard thing is to have Sex at the right time when you ovulate. the Best is to find out your Ovulation time, then instead of hopping in the sack, make it one hell of a night. go dancing, dinner, and make sex very passionate. longer four play, and slow and more erotic sex. not only is this great for you and your partner, but is will also increase the males sperm count and potency. Remember it take around 24 hrs for the male sperm count to become potent again after sex, so make dont just have sex in a 3 to 4 day run. and last but not least...relax. Good luck and your daughter is a Jem.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	If you're trying to conceive, you should stay off alcohol, it could not only reduce your chances of conceiving but could also cause birth defects if you drink when you're pregnant.|`|AA12380746	wow, the answer above mine made me blush! lol.    All I have to say is plenty of kids have been conceived on drunken nights, and they all seem to be fine. I think that the real danger is if you keep it up and drink all of the time. I honestly think it's early enough for you that it won't hurt your baby.    I thought I was going to stay away from drinking when we first decided we were going to ttc... if I had stuck to that it would have been a long flippin 5 years! lol.    ah but what can you do. Who would have thought being allergic to wheat can make you less fertile?|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	Technically its only been a week since you stopped taking the pill. My honest answer is to not have unprotected sex until after the party and have fun. Always being responsible while around children of course :)|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	If you are TTC you should not drink.. period. Ovulation can occur at any point after stopping birth control, and that can not be accurately predicted unless you are using your basal body temperatures to detect a shift.      I guess if you are really wanting to drink for the (superbowl maybe?), you can buy an ovulation predictor kit and take it the day before and the day of the party. If it shows ovulatory indicators from the test, refrain from drinking but if there is no color response, you should be okay to have a few beers.|`|HclKftzAaa	i took two years to conceive after coming off the pill. I am overweight and have PCOS though.    I was being SO good the whole time, i lost 10kgs and everything. And i tell you what, i hadn't drunk as much that whole two years as i did the week before i got pregnant! Lol. (there was a wedding and seeing overseas relatives etc).    The healthier your body is the better it works. but one or two light beers should be fine. :) Remember to stay hydrated though! :D Even if you have conceived, the alcohol should be gone long before any brain development is going on.    Also, you are supposed to count your cycle from the FIRST day of your period. not the day it stops. So, you are at the mid-point in your cycle now. It is possible that you are ovulating some time soon (usually around day 14 of your cycle). Bear in mind though, that it usually takes around 3 cycles for your normal functioning to return. :) Good luck!|`|2C5PAfaZaa	Its possible you could conceive but I don't know how likely. I question whether women are highly fertile because I follow fertility awareness and know how it works really well. You only have 1 egg a month which dies after a day but you could be highly fertile compared to others - producing sticky mucous for longer which helps sperm to live longer while waiting for egg... thats the only way really. When you come off the pill it might take a while for your natural rhythms and mucous patterns to kick in again. Sorry if TMI|`|SGOJFMv1aa	I would have a few beers if I were you ! If you have really only been trying for that short of a time there is no possibility even a doctor could know if a little swimer reached an egg. Relax your first child is just turning one have a beer before you put another baby in the oven! Good Luck with number two!|`|i2sMBoPIaa	I'm not being nasty, but why would you even consider beer to celebrate your 1yr. old's B/D? Be sober & celebrate with her. It is her day she's not 21 yet. I don't know much about the time line, but I would not to be safe & being Fertile Myrtle well, God only knows when. Good Luck & God Bless your family.
es49dkt2aa	Braeden- Dark hair spikey , gorgeous smile, green or brown eyes, dimples, the kind of guy a girl would fall for :] haha|`|V9ddU84Iaa	I've noticed that people with dark hair (and eyes) tend to have strong, classic names, often Biblical names, while people with lighter or blond hair (and blue. green, or other light eyes) tend to have more trendy names (not necessarily that they aren't classic, but more that they are "cool" sounding)<br>  <br>  My favorite boy's name is David|`|rM67ueF5aa	I know a little boy named Aidan who follows this description.

xV0APOtaaa	I have no clue what to tell you in Mexico, but UTI's can be common with pregnancy (I found that out during mine, I had about 6 of them in my 9 months....including 1 just after delivery) so I would try to figure something out, just in case you have to do this more than once.    GOOD LUCK|`|1CryEnb3aa	Even if I couldn't afford the clinic, I would go back and tell them you want a test before you start the medication.  It may be too early for a urine test to show, but not a blood test.  Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Standard operating procedure in every country is different. A UTI in and of itself will NOT harm a baby it's when they get bad and it spreads to your kidneys when it could get bad for you and the baby. Maybe you could call your doctor in the US. Most antibiotics are safe in pregnancy so you are probably ok if you just call and check with your doctor.|`|CP1zxDLiaa	If the UTI is really bad, try drinking cranberry juice. Water also helps, just stay away from Soda's. Those will only make it worse. My sister and myself have had UTI's all of our lives, and we always drank cranberry juice. Its isn't the best thing to drink, but it seems to work, and best of all, no medication required! If Mexico doesn't have that then I have no idea as to what to tell you. See what a box of AZO's tell you. They help as well, i just don't know how safe they are for pregnancy!     Good Luck!!|`|JV0i77uiaa	I would go back and talk to the doctor and ask for a blood test, also you can try another doctor.  One thing I know, one of the best doctor from Mexico are in Mexicali.  Many people from California go there.|`|HclKftzAaa	have you thought of buying a pregnancy test?    if you don't want to medicate until your period shows up, drink lots of water instead. and try a less severe medicine- something over the counter.
Y8ZmuWwgaa	Eleanor is very sweet, but I prefer Josephine. This was a hard choice, but I think Josephine sounds modern without sacrificing its classic status. Somehow, I can't seem to stop associating Eleanor with someone elderly. Josephine, however, strikes me as spunky and fresh. I also prefer Josie as a nickname to Ellie.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I like Eleanor, as it is more classy sounding.  <br>  <br>  I know a Josephine who is really sweet and it is a nice name also.  I just prefer Eleanor.|`|AA10730122	Josephine, definitely. Josephine sounds so pretty. Eleanor sounds too much like an old person name.|`|z5l3mTUYaa	eleanor makes them sound like an old person who is about to die...... Josephine is such a pretty name i would definitely go with that!|`|GmaDTTEJaa	Eleanor but that's only because it's what they call the mustang in gone in 60 seconds|`|6az2lSc7aa	Josephine.|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Josephine. Eleanor is a horrible name.|`|6v4Gblxkaa	Josephine|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Josephine|`|qUD3Kn1Eaa	JOSEPHINE !<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <3|`|L3zxoUFVaa	Elanor reminds me of the nice car in gone in 60 seconds but i like Josephine better|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Eleanor is a very cute and unique name|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	eleanor|`|JaoaALmgaa	josephine you should name her josephina|`|X2FrjG8Laa	josephine thats good right there|`|se16q5Yzaa	Ummm None|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Josephine for me|`|pd6hbk0saa	Josephine. You have some cute nicknames with that too, like Jo or Josie or Feeny.|`|7drjpohUaa	Based on the name, I like Josephine. But based on nicknames (which isn't always the best idea) I like both, because Eleanor could be Ellie and Josephine could be Joey. But I like Josephine better.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Eleanor!|`|CxRJwJsraa	Josephine.<br>  <br>  Never been huge on Eleanor.|`|wdXQaATDaa	Eleanor is very cute!  =)|`|HBgnkltfaa	Again, this is another tough, touch choice.  They both get 10's in my book.  They're old-fashioned, elegant, literary, uncommon, familiar, and otherwise perfect.<br>  <br>  That being said, Eleanor is my personal favorite.  It's currently #2 on my girls' name list.  I like the uncommon "-nor" ending (and the potential to use the sweet Nora as a nickname).  I like the fact that Eleanor appears several times in Jane Austen novels.  I also like that it was always a feminine name (as opposed to Josephine, which was derived from the masculine Joseph).|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Awesomeness! I had to star. Did you remember that I have these two names paired up together, or is this just a coincidence? Either way, I like this question! My favorite one yet, I think. While I do like Josephine, I think I'm going to have to go with Eleanor. It's the first name in my personal pairing, with Josephine being the middle name, and I must say, I do like it a bit more. But when it comes to the pairing, I think they work wonderfully together. =)|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Both are gorgeous names. Eleanor would be my preferred name though. I love classic names :)|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Eleanor|`|djhCah5Maa	Josephine|`|KYyP8Dtraa	Eleanor<br>  <br>  Like Eleanor Roosevelt-- very classy =)|`|S3vYMNzFaa	I think Eleanor is a little nicer.  Sorry Josephine!|`|brVS3Pg0aa	Eleanor- so she can go by ellie if she wants!
MqFeJiukaa	In my previous pregnancies my ob started checking my cervix at 36 weeks and every week after.  My midwife has not mentioned when she wants to check yet and I will have my 36 weeks appt on Mon.  I know ifs always nice to find out if you are dilated and making any progress but for me I was checked at 31 weeks because I went to the hospital with spotting and was already 2cm.  It has made me reflect on past experience and realize these numbers really don't mean much to me anymore because I always go over due lol.|`|TqnlnIBraa	It depends on your situation, really...  there is no specific time when they are going to check.  Doctors or Nurse Practitioners will check when they feel it's necessary.    With my first pregnancy, my OB checked  at my weekly appointment last few weeks of my pregnancy.    With my second pregnancy (triplets) my doctor never checked.    Good luck, hope you and your baby have a healthy pregnancy!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Probably at your next appointment or soon after.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Nobody ever checked until I was past my due date.|`|AA11763588	In my experience they start between weeks 34 and 36.|`|ejHfqSD1aa	Mine started at about 29 weeks, but I have also had problems with my pregnancy. But I think normally they start at about 35-36 weeks.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	With my first I was checked at 36 weeks. It'll be about the same this time around.
38MaYTf8aa	It took me 6 months to fully adjust to the synthroid to get my levels normal. (I then conceived 18 months later) I'm now 9 wks pregnant and had my levels tested two weeks ago and my levels are still good so I haven't needed to adjust my medication yet. My levels will be tested every month to confirm my levels are staying within the "safe zone".  Good Luck!!
SGOJFMv1aa	I would just take a test ! they are cheap and you can find them anywhere better safe than sorry if you are pregnant you need to get care from a doctor good luck either way the headaches sound like migraines which could or could not be pregnancy related either way you should probably see a doctor for that|`|f0KKQh2taa	If u had unprotected sex since december.. that might be a possibility but i think you should buy a pregnancy test , that would give you the result|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	take a test
Tz2D0grWaa	Dear Baby,    I am 35 weeks pregnant and I feel disgusting, but, you know, it is not about me, it is about you, how are you?  I can hear your heart beat, see and feel you move inside me, what color are your eyes, your hair, will it be straight or curly?, I cannot wait to see you, hold you, kiss you, cuddle with you.  We are going to name you ________ b/c ________.  Will you become a doctor, a soldier, a teacher, I don't care as long as you are good and kind.  You are mine and I am yours, together we will live, love, laugh, hurt, cry, rejoice, sing.....  I can't wait to see you    Now I think you might feel a littler better?|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Go to a day spa, have your hair done, a facial, massage, pedicure, manicure and lay in a fragrant oil bath.  Will do absolute wonders.  Then, get your husband to take you to dinner.  You will feel great!!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Go do something nice for yourself like a pedicure or a facial! Just because your body doesn't look the way you want it to right now, doesn't mean your toes and face can't. The pampering will do you good! Also, I'm sure you look beautiful, even though you think you don't. I am feeling the same way about myself right now though, so I understand! I just cannot ever remember looking at one of my pregnant friends and thinking she looked bad... in fact they all looked lovely to me. I try to keep that in mind! It's hard sometimes with the crazy hormones...lol :) Cheer up, not that much longer to go!|`|MqFeJiukaa	I can totally relate.  I am 35 weeks also and I feel fat.  My belly is bigger then it ever was with my other kids.  I also have a 1yr old so my babies are going to be close in age and I didn't lose all the weight yet from my last pregnancy.  We had family pics on Sat and I felt like I looked so big I was depressed.  I just try to eat a balanced diet and exercise to feel better no matter what.  I find that I feel better about my appearance when it feels like I have some control over it.  Just remember pregnant women are beautiful even when we do feel gross.  That is what I tell myself as well.  Good Luck.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Don't delude yourself into thinking you're suppose to feel a certain way in pregnancy. I am only 12 weeks and I feel the same.   Just treat yourself to a day of pampering. Go to a spa,get your nails done,hair trimmed,see a movie and have lunch with your friends.|`|UX0Otm6xaa	I totally know how you feel. I'm 29 weeks 4 days and I've been feeling disgusted with myself for about a month now. I went from 110 lbs to 145lbs, I can't wear any of my corsets, my thighs don't fit in any of my Tripp brand pants or my designer jeans, and I dread having to get dressed up to go to a metal show b/c I'm down to like 5 tee shirts and 2 pair of maternity jeans and I can't show off my awesome back tattoo with tiny tops or low rise pants. My acne from the 1st trimester has come back too! I fee like everywhere I go, I don't belong or everyone is staring at me.|`|bAqXXxagaa	A week from now your going to have a beautiful baby. What else matters :)|`|SGOJFMv1aa	IM 33 weeks and was being very  hard on myself about the way I look   but the thing to remeber is you are creating a life theres nothing more beautiful then that and like the answer above says still treat yourself Also think of all the women out there that wish hope and pray that they could get pregnant and experience the joy of a life growing inside them feel beautiful onfidence goes along way! :)|`|h8L27Xk9aa	I felt terrible too so I understand but as I look back and look at other pregnant woman I realize that I was beautiful.  Your body is going through an amazing journey and you should be proud of every curve.  Soon you will be holding the most amazing gift in the world.  So be confident that you are beautiful and eat right and get some exercise (just walking at this stage in pregnancy) and after you have had your baby and the dr gives you the go ahead you can work on getting your body in shape.    Remember your pregnant body is beautiful and you should enjoy this journey that will soon be coming to an end..      Best of luck to you!|`|WFxVuM1Laa	I have a wife that is 21 wks prego and she feels the same way. I, like many men, find pregnant women very sexy. I think your man should be feeding you bonbons in bed right now!
1CryEnb3aa	I had a low placenta and was put on bed rest from 12weeks til delivery.  I don't recall that kind of pain at all. It could be from the infection. I would call the doctor first thing in the morning and explain as you did to us to him/her.  They should be able to answer your question and ease your mind.  Hope you feel better and good luck!|`|MzHwklzKaa	Vaginosis often leads to bladder and kidney infections.  That would lead to pain/pressure and not being able to pee.      If you think something is wrong, it's never a mistake to see a doctor.    Instinct is nothing to ignore.  Pain is nothing to ignore.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with the last answerer.    You might have a urine infection, or it could be your low lying placenta.    I would call your doctor or midwife this morning and ask for some advice on this since you don't recall these pains before in your previous pregnancy.
UUpsa35Daa	I never really had a childhood...i went from 10 to 20 in no time at all. Of course to fully understand that, i'd have to give you my life story.    While i do wish sometimes i could've had a "normal" childhood, being a kid and teen and all that, i'm 17 and have been living adulthood for years... I moved out on my own last year and have been supporting myself fully. I've been through so much and have grown so much throughout the last 7 years.    I love who i am right now, i love where i'm at right now and i wouldn't change anything. Who i am now is all that matters, not what i missed.  I'm excited to continue on with my life :)|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	Excited    But im only 13|`|gG8oyymiaa	What childhood? I wish I had one. For the teens that wanna grow up stop! Stay young for as long as possible. Having to be a grown up is not all fun and games!|`|op55FtqYaa	I wished my childhood away now I'd give anything to have it back!|`|IwvOKjfcaa	Im only 16 and for the past 2 years i have been pretty much raising my niece, so i would say i have had to grow up pretty quickly. I do miss my carefree childhood, but i love what im doing now better.|`|pcvcMePXaa	i do miss my childhood, because there were no worries then and i just did whatever and my cousin was still alive then and thats when i was happiest and everything was ok we were best friends and now its going to be so hard to try and go on through life without her, but i know she would want me to be happy and go on with my life to bigger and better things. i also look forward to being older, like 19-26 i dont wanna get old i cant wait to be legal drinking age 6 months left and more responsibilities and a career|`|z3GnaxhDaa	I miss it :( I hate being a teen. When you're a kid parents scold you and you just give them the blur innocent look. Doesn't work anymore. :O|`|cj7CYD9haa	My farts smell of bacon.|`|NJv2zKxnaa	No.    I love being a teenager. I want to stay my age forever and along with my parents and family and friends.  Thats what I used to wish for when I was little, that I could stay a same age forever, like when I was 6, 7, 8, ect.    I had a great childhood...I wish I was more appreciative of it though.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	i personally hate childhood and i can't wait to grow up. being tormented by my older brother and parents that hardly cared about me not the best time. My parents still aren't that supportive even though they yell at me when i say they aren't. They are pretty much against everything i do and hate the fact i quit cheer leading for high school marching band. When your a child you always have to do what your told and have no voice in society. As a teen we have more choices in life and can be more independent and less dependent or close to our families. When i grow up i plan on moving to either france,england, or california to get away from my family. Im in connecticut now. I can't wait for the adventures of adulthood and being able to live on my own.|`|E55gbAkIaa	both i miss not caring abut what i wear or do but i am exited to get done with school start a family and get a job|`|USKUUn8Kaa	Yes i miss it some of the time. Most of my childhood friends have moved away or i have lost contact with them which makes me sad, but I have met alot of new people and also i am excited for growing up and experiencing new things in life :)|`|gbX2aTu0aa	Excited to get into adulthood. =]|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	I really miss my childhood.  I'm in my mid teens now and life has gotten really tough since my mom lost her job and my dad died.  So I wish I could go back to my "other life"  But hopefully life will get better in the coming years:)|`|oJ7lCMRsaa	i am 18 and sometimes think that i am growing up too fast, yet i am excited to be moving out soon hopefully :) and i am excited for adulthood.    nice question :)|`|4WgsBvq1aa	I think i had a good childhood, i did everything a kid should and never tried to be a teenager during childhood like many are now, i think it was a great time because those years of your life are only a small portion of your life but those are the years which shape you forever.  i don't think i want to go back because i love being a teenager alot more mostly because i enjoy highschool and college more, but as a soon to be adult i am excited but also sad because i know that being a kid and a teenager is such a short amount of time compared to that of your adult life..i mean you have 18 years to have fun, learn and grow and after that you stop growing but you have what 58 years to age.  so for the moment being an adult seems exciting but i know after a couple years of being an adult i'll want to trade in the bills and responsibilities for my youth and seeing friends everyday with no cares.  great question hope my answer was good haha  ;)|`|4b72344a7ffdd832d2d96bc0a3362486aa	definitely miss my childhood. as awesome as college life is, i'm resposible for somehow earning $3,000 more by the beginning of April to pay for next term...|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Adulthood!    My childhood was extremely lonely. My parents bought me every single thing I wanted out of guilt, but never played with me. Or tucked me in a night. They got a bunch of nannies to look after me so they didn't have to.     Now me and my mum fight a lot, but at least she's paying attention to me =]|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I miss my childhood because of my grandpa.I was so close to him.He used to pick me up from the bus stop and let me ride in his eletric wheelchair.He died from cancer.I think about him every day.|`|vBA6ZqAHaa	eh. my childhood kinda sucked. i'm glad i have more social skills now.  at the same time, sometimes i just wanna goof off.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	I'm not ready for adulthood yet.

EMKuBql8aa	People with DS are extremely vulnerable to expressions so it is a good thing you are asking. Try a big smile and then greet him with a hug. DS kids are very lovey dovey and love hugs and holding hands and such. They are some of the sweetest kids!!    EDIT: People like Ali make ME want to vomit. Ali, you are obviously poorly educated and ignorant.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is obvious to me, that you have a lot of compassion.  Reach within yourself and, be more accepting of them.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Put vaseline on your teeth it'll force you to stay with a smile on your face.|`|UO5fhJDMaa	i don't know, take him some place fun...    question though:  do emo kids have down syndrome, too? i mean, they cut themselves, wear black, always alone, cry a lot, and many more...    do they have down syndrome?|`|PCXXnKfGaa	Ive met a few ds's and they are by far the nicest people you will ever meet, As one person said just give them a big hug as they like to holdhands  and other things !|`|IcSRXtHwaa	wow! good for you for spending some of your time through volunteering. You are a great example to others.    First of all, familiarize yourself what Down Syndrome is. Brush up on some knowledge. What Down Syndrome is all about, how you must approach a person with one and what to do in case of emergencies. It would come in handy.    And general rule: treat them normally like any other kid. Put on a big smile! One you get passed with your initial reaction, smile a genuine smile and i'm sure things will work out fine. :) Hope that helps!|`|YWekskHcaa	dont react. no doubt the person can sense it. just go along happily with them.. or if you can feel the weird look coming on, look at something else.    idk , i volunteer at a local special school, and i just dont react, just smile and talk to them, or think about how nice their hair looks today or something..|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Spend time with them.    Eventually, you will get used to it and think of them as any other child there that was born uniquely different.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Just try as hard as you possibly can treat them and think of them as "normal" children. And that's weird me even saying that because there is no such thing as normal...every child, every person has something about them that makes them different or special in their very own way.    Don't feel sorry for them or think down upon them...be honored that you get to spend time with them and make them happy. Because that's what it is...being able to do those things is an honor.|`|hstwNjNaaa	Just remember to be as friendly when you first see the kids as when you are when you're playing with them. You'll get more used to being around people with disabilities, and after a while you won't have any sort of unusual reaction. Just relax and smile when you come in, I bet none of the kids even notice! All of them, downs syndrome or not, are probably just excited to play with you.
EMKuBql8aa	I think it is more instinct. Babies wont remember experiences of course. But the mom's smell, her voice, her taste even all those are familiar to the baby. I think that is what they mean when they say bonding because that is why they tell men to talk to the belly so the baby will get used ot hearing the mans voice, same concept.     Good Question!!    EDIT: This should help explain some things!    http://health.discovery.com/centers/preg...      It's actually really amazing what a baby can do in the womb. When you have multiples, they have caught them bonding with eachother (holding hands, touching, even kissing) They have more sensory capabilities then most people are aware of.     Here is something really cool, has to do with how multiples bond with eachother in the womb:    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/articl...|`|c51o7yqtaa	Do babies SMELL in the womb? If they're lungs aren't working I doubt they smell anything at all. I think that hearing familiar sounds will comfort them when they are born. Like they will know the sound of your voice and the father (if they talk to the baby before it's born) but I actually never heard about "womb bonding" before your question, so I don't know how to answer it. Sounds kinda odd though . . .|`|HclKftzAaa	that's a good point- a baby can hear it's mother's voice better than any other when it's in the womb. talking to the baby is very important, it causes a natural reflex of feeling safe and calm.    Not being able to actively remember something doesn't mean that they won't respond to it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Well studies have shown that a baby responds more to her mother's voice in the womb than any others so there has to be some basic instinct involved.
AA10167940	A couple days ago when she clapped her hands for the first time-|`|oF2kOKlnaa	When my five month old son giggled the other day.  It was gorgeous and the BEST sound in the world.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	She crawled over to me, tugged on my pants leg, looked up at me and said 'mum'. The first time I had heard her say it and it was so gorgeous. One of the most precious moments of my life|`|HclKftzAaa	last night when hubby and i were watching the kicks and wriggles. :)|`|sAAnquoTaa	The other day she was in her excersaucer and started wining a little I walked to her and she started laughing and put her hands up in the air until I picked her up. I thought it was the sweetest thing to know she wanted me to pick her up and that she showed me that.     She's 7months.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	It seems like I cry everyday ( I have become a real sap since I gave birth ). She has just recently been getting the giggles when you talk to her (she is 7 1/2 months old) I love hearing it and it brings tears to my eyes. And my son (who is not a baby, he is 10) saw my hubby and I doing yard work outside tonight and came out and asked if he could help! If anyone else has a 10 year old then you would understand that would bring a tear to your eye as well, LOL.|`|AA10368053	my baby is almost a moth old and I sure haven't cried with happiness or love yet. I've cried for going a week with out sleep though. I laugh when he does something. Like his little smiles and the little non cry sounds he makes usually make me laugh.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	2 days ago my 2.5yo was following me around, asking "what are you doing mommy", "Where is Nicco mommy?", "I drop my cup mommy", "lets go outside mommy", and about 100 other questions while I had an awful headache, so I sat at the table and had my head in my hands. Kai came up to me and says "Mommy lets go! Go outside!" I didn't answer so he said "Want some juice mommy?". When I still didn't answer he came over, and while trying to hug me he said I love you mommy!"  It was SO sweet and of course I cried, and felt bad for having my own little "mom breakdown" lol|`|IwvOKjfcaa	I picked my niece up from pre-school today (she's 2) and she came running out with her Dora backpack on and yelled out "weeeeeee" (thats what she calls me) and i had tears in my eyes, she was soooo happy, she had a massive smile on her face :D
r9gBoBLCaa	So she is almost three? I feel like I know you now Chloe, all you can do is correct her. I had the same problem with Noah, & Grace. Both 2 of 3 year old triplets that I nanny, (10hrs, 5 days a week.)  I have corrected them again and again. Noah caught on, Grace is still yet to get the message. However, in your case, you really are her mom. I would apply for custody when you are legal.     Are you emancipated? If so, you have the legal rights of a 18 y/o. You just might have trouble getting custody. Would your sister put up much of a fight?|`|AA11091233	That is so sad your sister is always passing her off. In your nieces eyes, you are mommy.    She will grow out of it as she gets older...so don't worry about it.    She's too young to fully understand you correcting her...so just let it go and consider it a compliment..it won't last forever and she is obviously very luck to have such a devoted auntie.    Take care.|`|EyKJ737daa	Your sister laughing is showing her maturity, or lack of, sorry sweetie but this is such a sad story.  So your little niece is going to be 3 in a couple of months, correct.  At 3 sweetie, it could very well be just a game to her.  Don't make too much of a fuss about it. Just correct her and continue on as though nothing is different.  When you are asking her some thing, perhaps ask her this way, "would you like Aunty Chloe to get it for you?".  Refer to yourself as Aunty Chloe all the time and just take little notice of anything incorrect.  My eldest has started calling my self and my husband by our first names and will call us and we just don't answer her, she then calls us mummy or daddy and we answer immediately.  I really do think it's just a phase she is going through.  She's having a tough time at the moment (almost an identity problem poor little kid) because she's not getting as much attention from her mum as she wants and needs.  Good luck sweetie and all the very best.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Aww...  That's so sweet!    I guess you can just keep correcting her until she catches on...    Maybe you should look into getting emancipated?  Then you could get custody of her, and wouldn't have to worry about her being around your sister and her boyfriend...    Just a thought! =]|`|n6XYYyoLaa	just keep correcting her, that's all you can do..five or six nights a week and you are 16? you need to be able to live and enjoy your teen years, sounds like your sis is taking advantage of you...

S5Lsbh0taa	Change the mind set of what your saying for just a minute...     I can see what your trying to get at here, it just needs more in depth thought and research. You can't find out an answer unless you ask the question to begin with...    Why not a support system that helps women who are thinking of relinquishing a child receive adequate counselling and access to some sort of pension to help them while they are pregnant and for at least the first few years after a child is born.     The counselling should entail things like their options, for fostering and long term care until they can support a child. Adoption really should be a last option not the first. Its been found that within months after a baby is born a mother can find ways to support herself and her child.     What your talking about has been tried and it didn't work, because of the poor outlook people had towards single mothers. They were often forced to give up their new born babies without a say in it. It happened all over the world. Especially during the post war period.    My child's birth mother didn't have us paying for her medical or living expenses. I don't like that system its to open for abuse anyway from both ends. We paid only our assessments and court fee's as adoptive parents. We had nothing to do with her choices because we only found out we were going to be parents two days before placement and our eldest child was seven months old. Thats how it is in some countries. Family preservation comes first, adoption is done only to provide a home for a child that needs one. (People have mistake that last line for thinking a single mother can't look after her baby, wrong way of thinking, many can and many do it on a daily basis, some just need a little help in the first few months when they can't go back to work.)    http://www.originscanada.org/comparison....    If you have any other ideas please share them at least you might learn of how it be done to benefit young mothers in distress without them feeling obligated or forced to give up their babies.    Edit; Huh..Did you read the link? Australia STOPPED that practice at least 30yrs ago. (Special homes just for single pregnant women, there is now a single mothers pension, its longer term thinking.)  Family preservation is the first and foremost thing. Is that on your agenda with this program?   Those mothers would offered foster care first so they could get back on their feet, after the baby is born.(Granted it doesn't happen all the time,) If she then decides adoption the government social services finds adoptive parents but only after intensive councelling. (Our eldest child was six months old at time of placement. Aust looks upon things like pre-birth matching as unethical.)     I can see your wanting to help women and you're at least looking for a solution. But you'll need to do intensive research into this kind of idea to see who's best interests it really works in. I can see your really only just starting in forming your plan.     Here's another link that talks about how adoption is conducted in my country. http://www.community.nsw.gov.au/parents_... sometimes you have look outside your boarders....you could even call them to find out more. Keep looking into though, you may find you'll have to adjust some of your ideas before you put this to political parties.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	You mean federally funded bribery for the poor to relinquish their children in exchange for avoiding financial ruin due to medical bills?  No.  It's not a good idea.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	Why don't we pay for the mothers prenatal care and then let the mother keep the baby.  Why would we support paying for someone else to take the baby.    God, there should be NO medical costs for people to have a baby.  Here in Canada they have coverage, so it is not an issue.  But if you continue to not want medicare, then if money is going to be thrown at this issue to pay for prenatal care it cannot be soley for the purpose of bringing healthy babies for adoptive parents?  That is just so sick man.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I think I have a good amount of insight into this topic since I, well, I'm an adoptee. And I don't think there should be a federally funded adoption program. Instead there should be more programs paying for low income women's prenatal care, free education on parenting, free classes, support groups, hotlines, cheaper and easier access to education, work programs for moms who need help finding better work, and cheaper and easier childcare.    Generally I do not think the federal government should be involved in helping separate families. I believe the feds should actively promote familes staying together as much as they can.     Also, the hypothetical funding of an adoption program would do little good to create fewer abortions. An abortion is a safe, legal medical procedure used to terminate a pregnancy. Adoption is relinquishing a baby that is already born. Think of it in terms of "pre" and "post". You wouldn't be able to adopt a baby that is in utero or have an abortion once the child is born.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	That sounds like a government program designed to transfer the babies of poor women to other "more deserving" couples (aka rich, white, suburban).    We don't need this kind of social engineering.  Babies are best raised by their own mother, and if she is truly incapable, the extended family is the next best solution.  Passing children around to strangers is not good public policy.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Pregnant mothers can already get free prenatal care through Medicaid (medicare?not sure which?).     I think that is actually sort of a disgusting idea, just to do it for women who are going to place their babies for adoption. You can only get the required medical treatment if you give the baby away to people with more money? Why not just pay for the prenatal care for everyone who wants it?|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Good idea....how about a disgraceful and despicable idea even in a perfect world.     How about Universal Healthcare without the stipulation to give away their babies.  How about laws that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against pregnancy.      Your idea is just another way for Aps to get out expenses as well as coercing girls to feel like they have to go through with relinquishment.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	I personally like the idea.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	We had this years ago. The federal HEW issued a mandate that white unwed mothers would relinquish their babies. Medical personnel stole babies from their mothers bodies right in the delivery room. Single white mothers were not allowed to see, touch or keep their own infants.     Social workers and judges issued warrants. Mothers were threatened with court termination of parental rights  if they did not sign "papers for adoption." Their families were threatened with extortion if they did not pay back agencies if they kept their babies.    The Womens Movement didn't just become involved in abortion and birth control.    Civil rights for single and pregnant mothers and women were fought for..like the right to work, the right to stay in school, the right NOT to be fired, the right to child support, the right NOT to be RAPED(Congress passed the Rape Shield Law in 1979..to protect raped victims)..mothers fought for the right to  KEEP their children.    Where do you think all of those older adopted people came from? Have you ever heard of maternity "homes"? Do you realize that adoption records are still sealed?     The records are sealed to protect the adoptive parents and the adoption agencies and the government from the revelation...of WHAT they did to natural parents and their children.      The government gave grant money to adoption agencies,..and looked the other way when the agencies  forced those white unmarried mothers to relinquish their babies.    There is no reason to give money to pregnant women to help them lose theri children. They should be helped to KEEP their children.|`|XyU6oEVPaa	Earlier, less traumatic for WHO?  Not for the mothers and not for their babies, surely.  It was tried during the BSE, and any adoptee or mother on here who suffered their loss prior to 1972 was a part of it.  Our babies were taken from us, often forcibly, and you sure don't see a lot less trauma do you? And healthier?  By what measure are you discussing healthier?  My lost son's family was far less "healthy" than the one he was removed from.      What you are suggesting is coercive to the extreme and is nothing less than Social Eugenics!  You are suggesting socially engineered families.  Have you read nothing on here?  Have you read nothing about the history or effects of adoption at all?  Do you know anything about the loss of a child to a mother, or the loss of a mother to a child?  Just the discussions of the past few days should open your eyes.      In the first place, what you suggest is illegal and a violation of women's rights, it is a violation of a child's rights, and it is unethical, at the very least.  Just your statement "...to send the child to a better home..." smacks of Eugenics.  That has been tried over and over, and it simply doesn't work.  And, thank Goddess it doesn't!!!!!    What are you talking about, "matching funds for foster care?"  What matching funds?  Maybe you should do your homework before you post a question, because clearly you don't have a clue as to what you are talking about.    ETA: You said, "I recognize your passion on the issue, but slamming someone trying to help instead of pointing out the flaw in their ideas alienates them."    Sorry if my statements 'alienated' you, but your insensitive suggestion alienated me, as well.   However, you are assuming that my response was 'slamming' but I can assure you that you were not slammed.  I meant every word I said in the kindest way possible.  How can you nicely tell someone that they don't know what the **** they are talking about?    The matching funds you are referring to is, I believe, money that the state gets from the fed for placing children into adoptive homes from foster care.  That has nothing to do with the mothers, the child or the PAPs except that it encourages the state to do early TPR of adoptable children so that they can get their cash quicker from the Fed.

Unique is good, but all names really are, if you're going by sound is a bunch of syllables stuck together in a sequence that is pleasing to your auditory nerves, which basically = bull**** if that's all you're choosing a name based on.    Here's a way to find a great name: Look up yours, or the baby's father's ancestry, look up names related to your ethnic background, and find one who's sound and meaning that you like.    Also, sometimes it's a person who makes a name great.  Name the baby after a family member, or a friend who's name you might like just because they're so nice, it makes the name, or related sounding names remind you of a person with positive character traits like theirs.    Just, whatever you do, avoid the top 10 baby names unless you have a really great reason (other than "It sounds cool") to name your kid that...    Oh, yeah... Forgot to mention, if there is a particular character trait that you find admirable, such as: Honesty, steadfastness, loveable, charitable, giving, kind... Even physical traits, such as good looking, beautiful, dark, etc...  Just google "baby name meaning -----------" and you will find some neat results.

If the stone causes a blockage, and you are unable to pass urine, or you develop a bad infection, they will probably try to remove it, as that is a dangerous condition.   If you get a fever, they will probably try to treat with an antibiotic before attempting a surgical procedure.   Kidney and bladder stones can sit for years in your system without causing any major problems. You should definitely try to wait until after your baby is born to address the stone as long as it isn't causing extreme pain, bleeding, blockage or serious infection.
2pxiK9waaa	Have your mom call--chances are there's not much she can do.|`|oFVjzgT9aa	You posted your question in preeschool/toddler section.
UYfqzCoMaa	Oh absolutely. You see your child every day that you don't really notice the weight and height so it's awesome to see how much they have grown. Then my son who just turned 2 is saying new words every day and putting sentences together and that makes me proud. To think of it, my kids make me proud of them every day. I get what your saying though. You are proud of yourself for being an awesome mom and doing the right things for your child. I feel that way too!|`|FUOLr64jaa	I took my son to the doctor Sunday b/c he had been throwing up so much that I thought he was dehydrated.  Luckily he wasn't, but the dr. told me if had waited any longer than he would've been.  I was very proud that I recognized that something was wrong with my child and I did something about it!|`|LMc23g9Maa	yes, it's a nice feeling when the doctor says that he's growing beautifully.  However he makes me proud MOST of the time.|`|n3IoftMFaa	NO! I feel nothing but disappointment!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, you are walking at 7 months - BIG WHOOP!|`|ibj4lPkvaa	I always feel really proud because he is doing so good. BUT when I take them in sick I kinda feel like a bad mom.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I feel proud for sure... he has his 9 month appointment next Tues too.. I am so excited to see what he weighs and how tall he is. and no shots his time! yay!
SGOJFMv1aa	At least you are clean now and making an effort I never had a positive relationship with my father because he is too selfish to grow up I applaud you for doing what your doing and acually I'm married and expecting and couldn't be happier I dont believe you have ruined his psyche.I'm strong because of my lack of guidance but THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE IS NOT TO BE INVOLVED NOW!!! Really though great job on reforming yourself for your child don't beat yourself up about the past build a relationship for the future GOD BLESS !!!|`|jIGjUeI3aa	Write him a letter explaining this, and watch him read it. This made me smile, you're so caring.
kaqPSgTVaa	The guy and maybe you will feel it rip. You will also see that it's ripped when it comes out. Condoms usually don't just tear a teeny tiny bit once they've broken (no matter how small) they will RIP.|`|MqFeJiukaa	You should know right then and there usually by looking at the guys face or him saying "oh ****"|`|AA11762804	umm usualy when the guy pulls out and has a pale look on his face LOL how do you know if a cup is broken? how do you know anything is broken? just look at it, if you cant tell then odds are its not, could have a hole in it but thats another story|`|ZQPsrNBXaa	You would know right then and there.|`|jIQKc1dAaa	you would know then. Particularly if the boy was a good guy and told you.
AA11763588	If you had a miscarriage your body would start to release your hormones, so to speak. They would drop by half every 48 hours until they hit 0.    If you didn't have a miscarriage it could have been your hormones messing with your body, sometimes this happens, your uterus will shed some of its lining.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	While it did rise it didn't rise as much as it should have. I'm sorry for your loss.|`|0F9b6g5vaa	well rising hcg is good are you going back for one more blood test to see if it is still on the way up , i was told i had a bloodclott behind my placenta at a 6wk scan and this can also cause bleeding in pregnancy just take it easy till you know what is going on and a friend of mine was carrying twins and lost one and there was bleeding with that as well fingers crossed all turns out well
q0JTN9QAaa	We eat at the table.  I have a booster seat that has a tray that locks down so he can't get out and if he gets fussy it won't do my son any good.  I lwave him in there about the same amount of time every meal.  He loves to play but he knows when he sit in the seat we eat or he can scream or whatever but whatever he does he will be in that chair.  So now he just sits and eats.  He is also very good in resturants and anywhere public.    Try smacking his hand or but till he calms himself.  That will help you a lot.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	My daughter is like that.  Even when she is sitting she constantly moves something.  The only way that she would eat would be if there was a show on(at that age).  She needed to gain weight so it was very important that she ate her meals and snacks.  Once she turned four I stopped having the tv on and put music on instead.  It only took her a couple of days to get accept the change.  Now we only eat in front of the tv if we are doing a movie night.  Different things work for different people.|`|HIn1p4OBaa	no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no!!! don't do that!! you need to discipline him to sit quietly at the table. you're the boss not him. remember that.|`|437b053823b358657201c137b57760fcaa	I think mealtime is about family time. I also dont think you have to sit down at a table to have family time. I mean, if you are forcing your kid to sit unhappily at a table then how much can they be enjoying their time with their family?   There were many times when my daughter and I ate some homemade pizza in front of the tv. We had fun, enjoyed our food and learned something too!  I dont see how hitting your kids hand or spanking them to make them sit at a table teaches any of the values that "sitting down to a family meal" is supposed to teach them.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I think that at this age, really, you do what you need to in order to get the job done. Lol.  My daughter is pretty versatile. She can watch tv, sit at the table with the family, listen to music, etc. while she eats.  It is important to get him into the habit of eating in a non-entertaining environment for the sake of going to other people's houses or god forbid a restaurant!    I make my daughter's food fun. I buy different character plates and utensils, special cups and sippies. I will give her pick of what she eats on or with. She will play with her food, that's just a toddler thing to do, but as long as the food is getting into her mouth and not on the floor I leave her be. They are at an age right now where they are exploring and their imagination is booming. Just today she had a little tykes pickup truck assisting to scoop carrots into her mouth (she figured out that the back of the truck was the same size as a spoon). it was clean, so i figured, why not? she was eating vegetables....i wasnt going to complain.    To get him away from the tv (so he isn't 100% dependent) I would suggest being the entertainment. My daughter may be 2.5 too, and can feed herself, but she loves it when I spoon up her food and cheer/praise her when she eats it. If she's being fussy about eating, I make eating fun. Shells and cheese is a favorite for her because the shells become finger puppets that she enjoys eating off her fingertips like a hungry tiger! She even growls! Greenbeans become living people that run around her table yelling "help" until she eats them. She acts like a boy lol. She sometimes likes to have one little people figurine sitting on her highchair table that eats with her, and she will share a nibblet of corn or a single noodle with it as she eats and speaks to it.     As she gets older, she is beginning to eat normally half the time and play eat the other half. But in restaurants, I get so many compliments when I can sit and talk to my husband while my daughter eats quietly to herself. A noodle might say "help" or a piece of bread may get up and walk across her plate, but it all still ends up in her mouth with no complaints. And she's quiet. So why should I complain?    with toddlers Ive learned the key is to be more creative than they are. I will make her food look like a smiley face so she gets excited when she sees it. Or add shredded cheese, apple slices, or sour cream, something I know she will want to eat to trigger her appetite.|`|jchCJZxTaa	NO WAY!!    tv can be a bad influence on a child, he needs discipline.   to get him to stay unplug the tv, and tell him he cnt leave the table till he finishes whatever he is eating.
zfZiXQ3Oaa	*ahem* wangers?|`|pfjxEZBmaa	ASk her if she wants blood on her hands from not being vigilant??|`|6KnRDlo8aa	freak her out like they do on punked,  <br>  try placing a dummy in a place where she might run it over so she'll get freaked out|`|gnIEDg6maa	And not just on the road.  They are everywhere! I found one in my bed last night.
n6XYYyoLaa	wear tight bras; nothing to stimulate breasts, no rubbing, touching , not even warm shower water on them....that's about the best you can do, they don't give meds to dry it any more; you will probably still leak some, so get a few pads for your bra!|`|EeGgovyCaa	The only way to dry up milk is to pump or breastfeed every couple days so you don't get engorged. Eventually it will stop all together.|`|OPloDbxvaa	lmao no lecture.. <br>  <br>  keep away from hot water(like in the shower don't have it direct on them )  , i tried everything , strap them tight , cabage leaf in my bra.. lmfao you name it i tried it.. and they only stopped leaking after 3 1/2 month... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Keep them wrapped tightly over a sports bra with and ace bandage 24/7. Only take it off for a shower and then wrap them back up. Don't take a hot shower. It took me several weeks for mine to dry up. Good luck.|`|z5CYobebaa	keep your bra on 24/7 even sleeping. and then when your in the shower DONT let hot water touch your boobs|`|62cQv3z3aa	cabbage leaves
ZBXCz0GLaa	We did a pretty big party with a lot of family and friends.  However, it was more of a BBQ style party so it was under 1,000. 700 I think?      We knew it would be mostly for the adults and we were okay with that.  We made sure we took a lot of pics for him to see when he is older.  Alot of family came from out of town to see him, some for the first time.      My son had so much fun at his birthday party.  We tried to keep him inside, because it was cold, but he did not want to!  He wanted to run around and play!  He enjoyed everyone there and he actually enjoyed his little birthday bash!  We were very happy we had a big party.  He actually got like over 400 in cash gifts and a lot of clothes and toys... so it wasn't a waste at all.    My advice... go ahead and have a huge party with all your family and friends... but don't go overboard.  Keep to a lower budget and save the rest for later.  Have food for everyone and probably get one of those blow up bouncers for the kids.     Good Luck!    add: his 2nd birthday is coming up and we are thinking of just buying him a good gift and no party... maybe a swing set or something like that =)|`|pXSKSS3daa	Wow! Honestly, I'd keep this one more low key and have her next(or even third) birthday be an all out bash.    Noah will turn 1 in about two months(BOO HOO!) and we're just having close family and friends in my uncle's fellowship hall for a pot-luck style deal. It's just basically getting everyone together to help us celebrate our little guy turning one.    I do think I'm going to do a couple small games because there are going to be a few older children there. Other than that it's just food and cake.    ETA: Two thousand is over-doing it in my opinion. I don't think I'd EVER spend two thousand on any of Noah's parties. That is just me, though. If you have that financial stability then that is your business.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I would wait and spend that kind of money on her sweet 16.  She won't remember anyway.  Besides, you are setting yourself up to out do yourself each yr.  One piece of advise that is off track a bit: strip her down to just her diaper when you let her dig into the cake!  You will save yourself a lot clean up and an outfit.  And this will make her easier to clean up as well.  Straight to the tub!  Have fun!|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I think it's more of a party for you and the family than her. Like you said, she will not remember it, nor know what's going on.... seems like a lot for such a little girl.|`|EMKuBql8aa	OMG, We got a cake and celebrated with my in laws and thats it, lol. That seems a little overboard to me. She wont remember, save the big party for when she is 16 years old. Just keep it low key and cheap, no point in spending that much on something she wont appreciate.    EDIT: Including cake and presents.......$100 total. Both of my kids had more fun with the wrapping paper more then anything, lol.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I did a big party. I got a face painter and a cotton candy machine. I did a slide show of his first year! That was fun. We had a great band. I spent 6,000. Food, entertainment and decorations. Sound system... Alot of randoms. Of the helium tank was like $250? My centerpicies were expensive too.|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	Way to over the top for any childs bday let alone a 1st bday that they will not have any memory of. Just have some party food and cake with family and friends.
MQjsspQ6aa	Yes i love that way of spelling it!|`|CRFLKFenaa	No, I know you want your child's name to be unique. However, bad spelling such as this can cause many problems down the track. People may assume it was an accident and doubt your intelligence. Your son may get bullied and teachers will mispronounce his name. Please just stick with the traditional spelling (Jackson). He will thank you later! Hope this helps!|`|QCIQP3Kbaa	No, I actually like Jackson better buttt for his nickname, I'd spell it Jax..|`|ZxJw85hfaa	cool its something diffrent.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Yes, it's better than the boring old school way!|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I don't really care for Jackson, but I definitely don't like Jaxon.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	I do like Jaxon better(:|`|MVXQv33gaa	maybe if i was from space.|`|SxbSb0zuaa	Yes. Its nice because the spelling is different from most other Jacksons.|`|iIPwAWJTaa	not really... it kind of ruins the spelling of the origin of the name- it would just confuses people....|`|8dbdea0ce9074ec79963c0209381d119aa	nah i like Jackson better|`|LgLpJxnwaa	Jackson is just alot nicer in general.  i dont know why it just is.    i dont really like the spelling Jaxon though|`|3XaREbrQaa	its really cool. never thought of that.|`|TTDMeaBcaa	No, it gives me physical pain.|`|Elxuvon8aa	not to thrilling to me it looks like it should still have an s Jaxson the x takes the place of the c and k but the s is still needed to make the son sound|`|5DK546BUaa	Actually, yes, I kinda do like this spelling... and I'm not a fan of misspelling names!! However, something about this spelling seems to make sense...    However, I don't think I could ever use it as it is too modern for my tastes, and I also couldn't see myself using any of the "son" names...    HTH :)|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Yes. I like it better than the traditional Jackson.|`|uB0QueSOaa	thats pretty cool i never even thought about the x...looks pretty cool|`|34VXCyvVaa	No, it's trashy-looking.  The traditional Jackson spelling is much better.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Looks like a sci-fi or comic book character's name.|`|Zki0DuLWaa	Interesting. That's pretty neat!|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I think it is different but its not bad|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	I like it|`|tLXD3yOWaa	yes i love it!!  it's a modern take on a wonderful traditional name  that way he won't be teased for having an unusual name  but he has his own little flavor to it at the same time  major kudos!! :D|`|aYVVwjBXaa	it sounds like an industrial cleaning solution to me. and its become so common that spelling it Jackson would be more original.|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	yeah definitely! gives a unique twist to a normal name.  plus putting an "x" in a name is just awesome, i'd say!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Absolutely not. It will be constantly misspelled and mispronounced. The traditional way, Jackson, is far better. It will save your kid the hassle of correcting people.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Jaxon is popular for the moment    Jackson has been and will be the dominant spelling longterm|`|bbO4DuwEaa	hate|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Sounds like some geeky software! Sorry! Saxon is an XML Parser!|`|vQJf2mIKaa	My Nephew is spelt Jaxon! He is 1 and a half. We call him Jax!|`|2WjfwMOjaa	yea - 4 1st name better than jackson|`|wUxnDLCvaa	Love it, i heard it for the first time last week when i was writing out name tags for a children's party.  It's actually become a favourite of mine now too!!|`|64fPwZ3xaa	Jaxon is okay though I think Jackson looks better.|`|mqNpqW8Haa	oh thats so cool how many people can say they have a x in there name??i have like the whole alphebet in my name and i still dont have an x (jealousy). nick name jax oh tres cool tres cool!! lol i might steal that for my sone someday hope you dont mind!! :)|`|wziUVyVoaa	It's kinda cool, but it confused me a little at first. When you get used to it, it's pretty freaking sweet though.    Jaxon Heath  Jaxon Tyler  Jaxon Miller  Jaxon Cooper  Jaxon Parker  Jaxon Bronx  Jaxon Harley  Jaxon Gunner  Jaxon Brady  Jaxon Hunter  Jaxon Bailey  Jaxon Leighton  Jaxon Logan  Jaxon Peyton  Jaxon Ryan  Jaxon Spencer|`|dNhgIMIPaa	YES!
UTjWlj9Yaa	yeah, the tools are stolen. he wouldn't be locked up for owning tools. those things have serial numbers and are registered to other people. there's way more to the story than you are hearing...|`|eu6UQElYaa	The prosecution would have to prove that he intended to use those tools for illegal purposes, so unless they have other evidence on him, then no there is no way they could prove intent and therefore no way he could be convicted of a crime in that case.  It is not illegal to carry around tools, even alot of tools, in your car.|`|MqFeJiukaa	I agree with your friends.  They are not going to file charges and put him in jail unless they have enough evidence that they believe he would be found guilty.  The first thing I thought reading the first paragraph is there is more to this story then what you are being told.  What does your mind believe in all honesty?  Would you honestly believe that if someone you didn't know told you that line?  Just a thought.|`|UXoTCL98aa	there definetly had to be more in the car then that or something. sorry hun but that story given to you is fishy. There has to be something that that friend isnt telling you or is hiding from you.    a felony is a serious serious thing and they woudnt give it someone based on the fact that they had tools in their car and maybe they used those tools for a robbery.  Theyd have to either kno that ur friend and them did rob that place based on some kinda evidence or there is something else to the story and hes trying to cover it up.|`|WupyR6UEaa	They must have had enough proof to put them in jail and charge him with a felony.  Someone probably reported tools missing, or they were seen taking them.  If he was charged with a felony, and a $10,000 bail, are you sure this is the first time he has been involved with the law?  Sounds like there is much more to the story then you know.  Call the court and see if you are allowed to go to the hearing.  Then you will get the real story.  That's a pretty high bail for a first time offense.    Rx Tech
EMKuBql8aa	If he is able to sit at home quietly on the couch and watch a movie he should be fine. If not, well, try the "test" next year, lol.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	I wouldn't take a kid under the age of 10 to a movie...|`|HyknHVV5aa	If you take him, go to a very kid orientated movie, such as a cartoon, and go to a matinee. That way, less people will be in the theatre if he gets restless.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	He should be fine.  I don't have kids myself, but I've taken my niece to the movies a few times - she was 3 the first couple of times and she just loved it.  Yes, she did get a little restless at times, but mostly she was engrossed in the movie.  She loved having a drink and popcorn and sitting in the dark.  She thinks the whole experience is great.  She's especially blown away by the big screen - "It's so much bigger than my TV at home!"    So go for it, just pick a movie you are pretty sure your kid will like and you'll have a great time.    I know here we have special screenings of kids movies especially to take toddlers and babies to - if you're worried about how your child will behave maybe see if your local cinema offers this...|`|goCkjhDzaa	I just took my friends 3 year old daughter to the movies about a week and a half ago to watch hotel for dogs and she sat right through it. and she is the type of child that does not like to stay sitting for too long|`|437b053823b358657201c137b57760fcaa	I started taking my daughter to the movies when she was 2. She always sat very well and listened. She is very smart and patient. I guess you would have to know your own child's behavior to determine if he is mature enough to go to the movies. I cant believe you have never taken him and he is 4. I think they are old enough at that age. We used to have SO much fun. My daughter is 6, almost 7 now.    good luck|`|1cdvZwIJaa	I think its too young. I went to the movies with my brother when he was 4 and we had to leave during star wars coz he didn't want to stay. And little kids always have to get to the bathroom during movies too. I would say 8. I used to go to the movies with my nana when i was 8.|`|9fbDfLZ0aa	Shut those whining kids up! I'm TRYING to watch the MOVIE!!!|`|HIn1p4OBaa	don't start him off. tv fries your brain. my two year old sister does nothing all day but sit on my other sister's bed watching "ant bully" on the "little tele". it's so awful!! find something else to entertain him with.|`|57b47866a23aafae5935da2e945386b2aa	My daughter is an energetic kid. She wasn't able to sit through a movie at the theatre until this year. She just turned 8.|`|xV0APOtaaa	My daughter is 2 and we've taken her to a few movies. Like Madagascar 2, something that is fast moving and keeps her attention. That and my daughter loves animals right now.    You should know your son and whether the movie you're thinking about would fit his interest. And whether he is able to sit and be quiet enough not to interrupt everyone else.     Personally I think you should be fine. GOOD LUCK
aeuWwrehaa	i was getting them from 6 dpo up until this morning and af showed this afternoon  2 days early. so good luck and baby dust
OVj5ysDAaa	Babies receive oxygen through their umbilical cord which is connected to the placenta, which transfers oxygen to the baby from the mothers blood stream.  They are surrounded with amniotic fluid, and cannot breathe in utero. Babies do not start breathing until their faces meet cool air. It has something to do with the temperature changes their bodies experience as they leave a warm environment and enter a cooler one.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They don't....They get oxygen through the placenta.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	They don't need air, they need oxygen, which is carried in the blood stream. The mother's blood goes through the placenta, the oxygen goes into the baby's blood stream.     They do make breathing movements in late pregnancy, they "breathe" in the amniotic fluid which helps them develop their lungs.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	No they live through the umbilical cord that's there life support. when it's cut they breath on there own.|`|LZpbJMTkaa	Their lungs r filled with amniotic fluid which they live in till they r born! They kind of practice breathing and swallowing in the womb, when they r born they lose the fluid n breathe like us! Amazing really! X|`|3qI1oyFaaa	They practice breathing, taking in amniotic fluid. But no, they don't breathe air normally... I'm honestly not exactly sure how that works either and have wondered the same thing myself from time to time haha...|`|BYoVsKY4aa	They get their blood via the umbilical cord from the mother's blood. This is why the oxygen saturation levels are monitored in the mother. They do practice breathing movements in the last month or so, however the do not actually "breathe" anything in except amniotic fluids, which does not actually oxygenate their blood, but rather is why they sometimes need to be suctioned out after birth.

ZIdhNsxPaa	He's only been out of the womb for 3 weeks. He's very used to being close. Try swaddling while you get him to sleep. And don't let him fall asleep next to you in bed, put him to sleep in your arms either walking or sitting. When you place him down, make sure you don't give him the feeling of rising or falling. My daughter is almost three and she can still end up crying if I set her in her crib too quickly. Move like a snail and keep him near your body until you can't anymore to set him down.  Keep trying, he is still very young, don't expect a miracle. Everything at this age takes time to get used to.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	try a 'swaddle me' wrap by kiddopotamus; ten bucks at brus and they can't kick it off or anything; helped mine tremendously|`|NH2Yg2x3aa	We did a lot of co-sleeping the first month, whether it was on the couch or in between one of those sleeper wedges in our bed. After the first month she started sleeping all night and at two months we just put her in her crib and she does great. I think it all depends on the temperament of the baby and what the lady said above might be a good idea too. My baby liked the warmth, not sure how to fix that.   Might be that the baby needs a little co-sleeping if you can accommodate, and see where it goes from after a while.  I usually have some part of me touching my daughter, arm-to-arm, or sometimes I put my face up next to hers or drape my arm over until she's fast asleep.|`|2LKABDPzaa	You can try putting his sleeper under your shirt for awhile so that it has your smell. Then, put it on him before he goes to sleep. When he's alone in his crib, he might think that you're there. Also, there might be another reason for his crying. Make sure that he's not hungry,needs a burp, cold/hot, diaper change, etc.|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, at three weeks old, their still used to being close to you...my son wouldnt either at first...then when he was about a month and a half old i started putting him in his bed during nap time during the day, and by two months he was fine...now he's a year old and the only time he wants to sleep with mommy is when he doesnt feel good...but these things take time hun, he's ysed to your smell, the sound of your voice from the womb and your heart beat...give it a bit longer and things will straighten out....congrats on the baby by the way!!! :) i hope i was of some help|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Put him into bed with you, hes only 3 weeks old anyways, way too young just to let him cry, he has never spent a minute away from you, of course its hard for him to sleep in his own bed
kaqPSgTVaa	You aren't that early...Sometimes periods come early.     You would NOT have to wear a pad with implantation bleeding and it would only be spotting, LIGHT spotting. That means a few drops or just some smears when you wipe. It doesn't last longer than a day typically,|`|AA11763588	Implantation bleeding is not as common as you'd think.    And most women who get it will tell you that if anything it last a day, with small drops of blood here and there, it wouldn't fill a tampon.|`|WO7WAP19aa	Hey, Implantation is like light pink or brown spotting, only noticable when you wipe yourself, its neer enough to soak up a pad - not even a pantyliner, no tampon nothing! & can last anywhere from a few hours to just a couple days, it should never be bright red & it shouldnt be a blood flow or anything., no implantation is never heavy!|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I had it with my first pregnancy. It lasted for only about a day, was light pink in color, I only seen it when I wiped, and all I wore was a panty liner and nothing got on it. I had slight cramping and was sure my period was about to start. It never did and when I took the test, sure enough I was pregnant...good luck.
Bv7cknLDaa	yes u have to take him to the hospital the he might be dehydrated maybe thats why he seems weak and yes pedialyte should only be used for acouple days and not substituted as food ....PLEASE dont wait around for anymore answers and just go to the hospital!!! u rather be safe than sorry....hope everything is ok|`|WxQFe0GYaa	What does his doctor say?  If you aren't getting answers from that doctor, find another doctor, or take him to the hospital.  A baby can't survive on Pedialyte and shouldn't be on it for so long.|`|nfLyS1toaa	not normal take him to the er|`|n3IoftMFaa	Uh, you haven't asked his doctor!?<br>  <br>  He may need to be on an IV to replace all the lost fluids.<br>  <br>  You did take him in, yes?|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Take him to the er!! If you are even questioning it, BRING HIM. Dehydration can be deadly in babies.
oXIYHsDaaa	yep, no really, a lot of kids just aren't comfortable talking to their folks about some stuff, or when it comes to sex they are just told to abstain, end of discussion. Those parents do have their heads up their well you get it..... oh and as far as home work is concerned, when I was in high school my parents had no idea how to help with my work. Things change and my mom never took physics back in high school, or math 12, or English 12, or history or music theory, ........ in grade 5 she could help, by grade 8 she was useless to me academically.|`|lzivF4Idaa	uhhm....my mom was at one of her boyfriends houses about the time i got pregnant.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Most parents won't tell them anything, they have this silly idea that if you don't tell your child about it, then they won't know about it, so they won't do it. <br>  <br>  Some of them don't want to accept that you're not their little baby any more, and schools don't go into any detail, they only tell you about puberty and nothing about sex, same for drugs they just say "drugs are bad mmkay" and go into no detail about them.<br>  <br>  So if parents didn't have "their head up their a*ses" stopped whining about how their children aren't cute little babies anymore that actually require time and money, and taught them about these things then there wouldn't a problem to begin with.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	some people aren't lucky enough to have a relationship with their parents where they can ask anything. Luckily enough I had a good relationship with my mum and would talk to her about anything but I am aware that not everyone is the same.<br>  <br>  Also remember being a teenager. At times the crippling insecurities, the feeling that you were the only one, the total confusion. I'm sure some of them are just a bit embarrassed and feel this is an easy way to ask cos no-one needs to know it's them.|`|4WainEllaa	get a life....we don't tell or parents everything, and besides, my parents don't know the answers to my homework questions. do you realize that your kids aren't going to talk to you about anything when they get to that age???? get over yourself, you kids, and your  "perfect" family......teenagers don't need to tell their parents about cute boys, it would be nice, but it aint gonna happen.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you guys think we don't google things for homework??? yeah right. I go to ONLINE school...they tell us to LOOK IT UP!!!!!! and we do, when we can't get the answers, we ASK!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ArmOXDoaaa	Let's get them away from their computers for a while--you know, to get out and do things. <br>  <br>  Hate to sound hypocritical here (since I'm online and posting an answer, too), but imagine if you could just... get them all away from the computer and out into the real world... what an accomplishment that would be.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	i think if they are legitimately going on because they are curious and cant talk about serious matters with their parents/guardians, then it's fine, <br>  homework, you can google it and actually do some research instead of being told the answers, <br>  and cute boys, i know it's all about the hormones but talk about it out of class, and to someone who cares..<br>  sorry to offend anyone|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I was afraid to talk to my mom face to face when I was younger about that kind of stuff. I shouldn't have worried because now I can easily talk to her, even about sex. But it was just that fear of doing it. Whether you feel you are open for your kids to talk to, its scary. <br>   I was embarrassed to ask my friends as well til I hit high school. So online where I can be more anonymous is great. I can still get opinions and answers without anyone having to know who I really am.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I talked to my mother about most things when I was a kid but sometimes its nice to get a second opinion. Why not do it on a board where you are unknown.
EMKuBql8aa	A kid biologically being yours has nothing to do with it. My wife has an amazing dad, he was there when she was sick, talks to her everyday on the phone and is a great friend to me too. He has raised her since she was 2 years old. She calls him dad without hesitation.     Her birth father on the other hand, left her mom when she was 5 months pregnant with her little sister never to be seen again. He wont even get a real job so the back child support wont be garnished from his wages. He is NOT a father and can't deserve the name.|`|edImOGbLaa	it might be, my friend is adopted, he lives with his "dad" he is black and his dad is white and they do not get along at all but if you treat him/her with respect like they are your own child, im sure they will turn out great|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Raising a child of course...and yes, I've raised two that aren't mine biologically and one that is....they are all my children and I love them all as my very own and for who they are and I think most people in similar circumstances would say the same...there is no question that with a biological child there is a certain kind of bond you develope that you don't develope otherwise, but with those children you develope a different bond, but a bond none the less.|`|AA10329469	Ultimately,all that matters is the emotional bondage you have with each other.Rest is all superfluous.|`|AA11742696	It doesn't apply...When I married my husband he had an already made family as I have 3 children..He has raised them since they were 11,4 and 3,he is now a grandfather.Their "biological"father has not been heard from in 16 years.So I say it isn't an issue.If you are able to love,nurture,teach,discipline,wrestle with,play baseball with kiss a booboo etc etc with a child.Then it doesn't matter if it is blood relation...Love is all you need to be a parent|`|IMeHKA3uaa	Raising a child is so much more important that just being a biological parent! Being a biological parent just means the child will have half their genes, but raising a child is a special bond. You love and nurture and teach the child and are always there for him/her.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I was seen as the mother to my boyfriend's adopted son from when he was 4 months to 20  months when he passed away from a heart defect. Even though he was neither of ours biologically we loved him more than anything, he was our world basically. We were crushed when we lost him and he will always take up a huge part of our hearts.    I don't think one is more important than the other, biologically parenting a child or raising a child. I think it's well known that nothing can take the place of making a child and going through pregnancy and giving birth to your own child...it's all a miracle. But knowing that you made such a huge change in a child's life...instilling your values and morals and watching them grow...and showing them so much unconditional love whether or not you gave birth to them is, in my eyes, also a huge miracle and blessing.    My life would have been so much different is my boyfriend and our son didn't come into it and i wouldn't change it for the world. I love my son more than i can even describe and i am blessed to have had the time with him that i did.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Anybody can make a baby. If someone is in your life, takes care of you, loves you, raises you...that is your true parent.
cm87ujQ1aa	Thats what i did with the pill,didnt take it on time.  Id say the earliest to do a test is about 2 weeks after u r late with ur period.    U could get morning sickness any time,some people have it through out the whole pregnancy,with me i didnt throw up once! So u may not even get it.    If u dont decide to keep it (hope u do if ur ready for it) i think the latest they do abortions now is 12 weeks....I THINK??  Try not to worry about being pregnant,i remember when i found out i was i freaked out,but once u tell everyone and get their support it all goes smoothly......and u start to get more and more xcited !!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	If you have already missed the period then you should take the test now. Most test say you can test five days before your missed period. Take the digital test because there is no guessing if the line is there or not. If it detects the hormone it will tell you flat out if you are pregnant or not.    I know you are not asking for my permission or opinion on abortions but please, please, please don't get an abortion. If you are pregnant then please keep this special gift or give it up for adoption. The child has no choice but YOU do. I would give anything and everything to be able to look my precious son in his eyes. I would give anything to hold him once again. My son passed away when he was 7 months old from Spinal Muscular Atrophy. I thank God everyday for blessing me with the 7 months that I had him here with me. Ppl would kill to be in your shoes right now.|`|MqFeJiukaa	You can take a pregnancy test the first day you miss your period, I always got morning sickness before my period was late but everyone is different, If you decide to get an abortion you should get it as early as possible...preferably before 6 weeks but they will do them up until 14 weeks in the state I live in.  I am sorry I don't know if the pill question is normal or not I never experienced that.  Good luck.
UUpsa35Daa	She lost her first real love...it's hard on every single girl who goes through.    Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done. Only time can help her. Just make sure a listening ear and open heart is around when she needs someone to talk to...she'll want to vent eventually and  to do it, she'll needs someone who loves her and is very willing to listen.    I know it's horrible watching your daughter going through this a feeling helpless but all you really can do is wait for her to come to one of you. Don't try to force her into anything...i know from experience that if she isn't willing to talk or go out, then she'll just close up more.|`|vBA6ZqAHaa	you sound like a very concerned and caring parent.  i wouldn't worry too much, just make sure you'll be there to support her. if she needs to cry on your shoulder, let her. if she needs to watch soap opera and eat chocolate, let. her. make sure you say, "i love you" enough.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Every teen goes through this it is part of life. Time will have to help out here, nothing you can do for her other than be with her.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Gee you are lucky, never having been dumped. It's only last night, just keep an eye on her. Maybe at the weekend you can go on a shopping spree with her or a day at a spa. Can't say I understand what's up with Derick, if he gave her the ring just a month ago, but who can fathom men's brains.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I went through something slightly similar to her.    While I was 35, when relationship started and, not quite 39 when it ended.  We engaged to be married.  I stuck by her, through two brain surgeries.  I thought I would be spending the rest of my life with her.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You have to let her cry it out and be there when she is ready for you.|`|CzdxFiRLaa	Oh the challenge of teens and their relationships.  For your daughter, this is like a death, but with the added punishment of public humiliation and embarrassment.  She will grieve for some time and will feel very fragile and shattered as well.      It is still very raw for her and you can not understand what she is going through, no matter how hard you try.  Giver her time and space and let her know that you are there for her, if she wants to talk.      May be a close girlfriend, around her age will help.  Just show your love and support, and time will bring her around.  It will hurt for a long time, but she will grow and move on.  Just be there for her, without being pushy.      Be prepared for some frustrating times.  Good luck.    David|`|upK8oN2oaa	Just be there. Just let her cry. However, you shouldn't let her shut herself away. Just start small, like asking her if she wants to go grocery shopping with you or even just to get her to eat dinner with the family. I feel so sorry for her. She must be in so much pain.|`|AA11974596	generally when im am mad or sad or depressed it makes me even more mad when people try cheer me up  i know this is hard for a mother to do but just don't do anything, unless things get dangerous, she should get better  it always gets better, even if it is slow, you just have to endure it|`|e2muGSbpaa	Mommy. Please just let me have my time to grieve. I thought Derick and i would get married as well, but its not going to happen. I just need to figure out what i'm going to do like i have many times before i just won't have his help this time. I appreciate all of the concern, Jamie, Justin, James, Jordan, their girlfriends, you and daddy have all shown, but its making me even more angry when you try to make it better. I will be ok i promise.|`|op55FtqYaa	Aww thats a shame.     But, you need to make her pull herself together. 17 is still very young and she has the rest of her life ahead of her. Things will change in the future and she doesn't need to take everything seriously.     Make her turn the music off, eat something and then go to bed to sleep. Then when shes rested its time to get back on with things - school and such. Moping isn't going to help her.    A bit of tough love is whats required here.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	This is such a shame.  Try to tell her that all things happen to a good end even though we cannot see it at all while it is happening to us.  I know that will be little comfort to her, but in addition, become very physical with her, handing out lots of hugs every day for a while.|`|iMNPH9I7aa	I know what your daughter is going through. Well first I want to say is that just let her cry. hold her while she is crying. comfort her. that'sis all I wanted when i cried like this. and second explain to her that life cant always be perfect. just one guy come on she probablyay a pretty girl who can get another boy. and yes let her stay home from school she cant go lookin like this. I did  and teachers and people i didnt even know were just askin me what it wrong. and i had to explain everything, and yea but your her mother and just talk to her and ell her about what will come in the future like marriage and when a man really loves her.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	You need to give her the space that she needs right now. And just let her that if she needs you that you are there for her. She needs time to get over this and it won't be done in one day. She had been going out with this guy for 4 years and she probably thought that someday they were going to get married. So this is going to take awhile for her to get over him.|`|Hcy6ySu6aa	listen, she is a 17 year old girls she going to go through alot of heart break in her life whay my suggestionis is to just be there for her when she needs to talk to you also a good shopping trip with mom should cheer her up but just you and her so she feels she can talk to you .. hope it helps!! :)|`|IcSRXtHwaa	I understand how you feel, cause my EX of fours years broke up with me some years ago and my Mom comforted me while I was healing. :)    Here's my suggestion. Let her do her crying for a bit more time. It was crushing for her because 4 years is a long time and her relationship is not just some fling. It was pretty serious and its her first relationship after all. Treat her normally, and feed her continuously with foods that uplift moods. chocolates or dessert might help, or anything sugary. :) Next is ask her if she's up for some girl bonding, you can take her shopping or have fun with just the two of you. Let her relax for a bit.    Some notes: leave an encouraging quote to her in her vanity mirror using an old lipstick. A short good luck message on her lunch bag, a sweet rose on top of her books one saturday morning. Any sweet things to show that you care and because you are also hurt because you're her mother. She'll open up soon, just give her a bot more time. Good communication will help her ease up.    :) good luck!
AA11742696	Cody is one of those lonely losers who justs stops by to @ *^ with people..It really is kinda sad.Maybe if he had a girlfriend??Of course with that act its not suprising he doesnt....WOW what women wouldnt love to be with someone so insulting..as to your question:      Child Support is Non-Taxable:    Child Support payments are not taxable. The parent making the child support payment cant deduct it from income and the parent receiving the payment does not have to claim it as income. For child support to remain non-taxable, it must be designated in the final divorce decree as child support. Although the payment and receipt of child support does not affect your taxes there is one important tax consequence related to child support payments:|`|VnOnxZcyaa	Get him to wear a condom next time and you wont have to worry about your seven kids.|`|HWAQ29s2aa	youll have a slot when you file your taxes for how much child support you recieved for the year and it will be taxed against you.
w1jyHMRbaa	Its very possible...you have the signs. Early signs include tender sore breast, gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation, nausea (anytime of day not just morning) headache, sore lower back and cramps. Take a test its the only way to know for sure. The spotting could have been implantation bleeding which is when the fetus implants itself into the uterus.|`|Ir4rfJtHaa	yes you could very well be|`|kaqPSgTVaa	How about you take a test and know for sure.|`|55AOkGa5aa	either go to your doctor or take a test...good luck...
lzEuuseJaa	Top private schools generally have curriculum a year or two ahead of the best public schools by 4th or 5th grade. The lessons move much more quickly than in public school and a child must keep up. A good private school expects a child to read books in 1st grade that students read in 2nd or 3rd grade in public schools. Private schools make up their own requirements, it's not like public school.    If a child is falling behind, and cannot catch up, they usually will ask the parents to find another school. This is because with every grade, the classes will get more difficult and the student will be struggling to keep up. This is not good for the student, imagine the stress! School should be fun!    My son's private K - 8 has a very difficult curriculum, and if a child is getting any C's in third grade, they will speak to the parents about finding a new school for their child. The parents are usually not angry about this, because they don't want their kid struggling and hating school -- especially while they are paying for it. They just find a school that is a better match for their kid.    Unfortunately, because of the learning pace of good private schools, they cannot stop the progress of the class for one or two children. It wouldn't be fair to all the other children. Many children in private schools have tutors from K because they need them to keep up. No matter how much the teacher wishes they could, she cannot spend an unfair amount of time with one child, when she has a classroom of 20. There is a certain amount of work the teacher must cover in a specific amount of time. It's not the same as public school.    Believe me, they don't care what ethnicity the child is, in fact, if it's a mostly white school, they WANT non-white children! Look at any top private school website and see how they brag about their diversity. They don't have to admit any child into a private school, if they didn't want your little brother to attend, they never would have admitted him in the first place.    Try not to stress over what the principal is going to speak to your mom about. Believe me, they want what is best for your little brother. It may be that this school isn't the best fit for your brother, and it's best to find that out early. They will be able to tell you which schools are a better fit. My son's friends that left his school in 3rd grade are all glad they did. They went on to other good schools and don't regret leaving.    Good luck! Your brother sounds like a very bright and sweet little boy. I'm sure things will work out for the best.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	I'd call the civil liberties union and the division of human rights..and bring my lawyer to the teacher meeting|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I see where your going with this your blaming it on race aren't you.  Anytime something like this happens to someone who isn't white it is racism.    Did you ever think that it is a private school and their standards were higher.  Also I don't think the teacher should take time away from students who understand the things they teach and could move along faster to catch up a slow poke.  That is what is wrong with public education right now.  Parents should go over everything with their kids to make sure they understand and if the kid still can not keep up hold hiim back or move him to special needs.    Also if he is in an American School it does not really matter how many languages he speaks if he is not good in english.  America is an English speaking country most of the world can speak english and if they can not they should.|`|HIn1p4OBaa	put him in a different school, or even homeschool. homeschool is great. i was home schooled all my life and went to school for the first time in my life today, in year 9.     and tolled is spelled told.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	First of all, to the answers that are rude and correcting, this is a sibling not a mother or father questioning, be respectful! I'm sorry, I see a concerned sibling asking about a little brother and get a little angry to see such responses.    Going onto your question sweetie. I would consider another private school or perhaps a magnet school. Even some public schools are quality ones depending on the area you are in.  Think of what's best for your brother. If he is being given this much pressure to be taking psychological testing at 6 years old, that is pretty bad. No matter whether it is descrimination or that the school just isn't for him, it seems best to transfer. At his age, he will make new friends and the change won't be so bad. If you fight this and force the school to keep him they will make his life hell.  I had a similar experience when I was his age. I was smart but I wasn't Ukrainian. The school I went to was primarily of that culture. My step-fathers family who were 100% Ukrainian were in an uproar over how badly I was treated there, and my grandmother from that side literally went to the principle herself. I ended up just leaving because they made it so hard for me. When I was sick they refused to give me homework, forcing me to come back behind on my work. Then they threatened to fail me. I was a straight A student when I went to a different private school and did just fine, went to my pick of a private high school and my first pick of college, one of the top ten in America.    So my advice is get your brother out of there. It will be best for him.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	What I can see is that your brother had a tough time for a little while, but your parents hired a tutor and he is doing well.  What happened to the other boy has nothing to do with your brother - for all you know he could have left because his parents didn't pay the tuition...they're not exactly going to go around telling everyone that was the reason.  The reason the Kindergarten Principal wants to meet with your mother could very well be to tell her what a great job he is doing and that they are impressed with his progress - you are jumping to conclusions that this is a doom-and-gloom situation.  If it is a good school, your mother will have a LOT more interaction with the teachers and such than she would at a different school that has a lot more children to contend with.  Personally, I think you are being a good sister to be concerned but don't assume anything you haven't been told to be the case.  Principals make just as many positive calls as negative.  ;o)|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	if i was his mother i would take him out of that private school and put him in a public one where the pressure is off and he can learn and interact with a variety of children from different backgrounds and ethnicities. a smart child can be smart anywhere, but does best with room to flourish.|`|3M5pHPwuaa	Have a lawyer ready.
HclKftzAaa	People don't breathe air- they breathe oxygen. and so do fish- they filter it out of the water.    And fetuses breath oxygen too- they get it from the mother's red blood cells.    And i don't think a fetus is not considered alive. I personally would never have an abortion. But who am I to tell anyone else what to do with their bodies. I am pro-choice, even though i don't much like abortion. I think it's better to have medical practices do it, than have women try to do it themselves.    Fetuses DO think- have you ever shone a torch on a pregnant lady's belly? I did that to myself, and the baby rolled over to look at it. If that's not intelligence, i don't know what is!|`|xRXjz8sAaa	breathing air is not the problem or the question. oxygen is still needed for the fetus to survive.   the problem is the rights of the unborn. does that child who cannot live with out its mother have the right to life?  or does that mother who is supporting that child have the right to determine life or death?    this will be a problem that society will deal with indefinitely! there will always be people who are pro life and those that are pro choice.    at the same time. there will always be people who abuse the right that was won that right being the allowed choice. and those who call names humiliate and disrespect women who have to make the most difficult decision of their life.    religion. and politics will always have two sides. its unfortunate. and neither side has an ultimate right or wrong. both sides have pros and cons.    i don't agree with abortion in many aspects. but at the same time. i would never want my right to chose to be decided by someone other then myself. i wish that was the view others held.    well i just rambled foreverer. hopefully i hit something relevant. thanks.|`|oazlYceraa	i totally agree with you. i was totally against it but after i did research on it i was able to understand why women do it. even then im not ok with it and would never do it honestly i believe that there's no reason for abortion specially with everything there is to prevent pregnancy.  people only say that a fetus is not alive because that way they feel less guilty. also if someone is considering abortion they should at least do research on it before making a final decisition and ask women who have been through it if they regret it.|`|CVA86LY6aa	Hot Topic!!! lol  My personal beleife is that unless it is endangering the life of the mother, or she was raped, abortions should not be an option. Even with the rape thing I'm unsure, I've been raped, and if i had conceived, i would have given the baby up for adpotion. THere are so many couples who are loning to have children and can't for one reason or another.   I think life really begins at conception. And its just like murdering someone in cold blood.   And Brittney S. Babies in the womb DO in fact breath, the mothers red blood cell provide them with oxygen. They also can feel, and their brains DO work!!!     Thats all I have to say!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sorry nobody I know thinks a fetus isn't alive...That's not the argument. The argument is when life begins. I think everyone knows a fetus is alive. Babies are fetus's later in pregnancy before that they are embryo's and before that zygote's. I believe you are thinking of the "start of life" argument.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It's the simple fact that they don't want to believe or know that it is human life.

I currently have a BABY growing inside me. I have for 6 months now. If this child isn't alive then I don't know what is. You guys try telling me that whenever she is kicking where you can feel it or kicking me in my bladder. This child is very much alive. Now I leave abortion up to the people making that choice. Do I believe in it well no. But its there choice. But if somebody try saying that baby is not living they are full of sh!t|`|30PIgrYoaa	let me say i dont belive in god that being said people are just ignorant lazy careless me me me first a mourning after pill is for what if there is nothing there then you dont need to take one|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	A fetus IS alive. Just not like you and I. A fetus doesn't breath, think, nor feel. We do.    No, they DON'T feel pain until later in the pregnancy when abortion is illegal. Do some research.
ETL9hDIBaa	My husband and I have been "trying" for almost a year  no other children  :(  I'm 24, my husband is 29|`|SLmLGwnNaa	This is only our 1st month trying... but i'm already so stressed that it hasn't happened, I started today.... bummer!!!   Were both 24 & have been together for almost 9 yrs, we can't wait to conceive our 1st baby!|`|29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	God, I wish!  Started June of last year.  6 step/adopted/foster, all grown up now  21,19,19,19,18,17  I'm 29, hubbs is 45    We caught pretty fast the first time through insemination, but lost it to miscarriage, now waiting to try again.|`|KGT1B0Elaa	Been married for nearly two years,... had been trying all along.. loves children, the both of us....  But no luck. Yet,    Me 28, Hubby, 30
kaqPSgTVaa	Every baby shower I've ever EVER been to the dad has always been welcome. If you want him to come then let him. HAVE him come. Your mother may be throwing the shower but she can't dictate to you who you want to be there. It is YOUR baby shower. :) Especially seeing as how he's in the Navy I'm presuming. My hubbie is in the Navy and as long as he's home I like for him to enjoy all the big moments with me as he can. I know he'll miss out on a lot eventually. :)|`|UAunAKdtaa	like i already told you,  tell your mom that YOU need your hubby to be there, because you dont get so much time together.  my husband arranged my baby shower and was there to help me sort away gifts and keep the whole thing organized. cake and plates and cups so i dont have to get up every now and then. just tell her that it is your will and your husband will be there no matter what she says.LIKE YOU SAID, IT is your baby, not hers.next thing you know, she is gonna wanna feed the baby and take him or her out for walks and stuff. draw a line!|`|HclKftzAaa	Even if your hubby can't be there for the delivery, do NOT have your mum in there with you. Find a friend who you trust and take them in instead. If your mum is there for the delivery, she will hijack the baby even MORE.    How DARE she insult your husband? Does she not trust your judgement in men? There is no way i would put up with that sort of crap from my mum.    Point in fact, my twin brother AND my husband are going to be at my baby shower. And i don't give a crap if anyone whinges 'why couldn't i bring my man?!' It's MY shower and i can have who I WANT there. And in your case, you hardly get to see your hubby and he will be missing a lot, how dare she make you spend any more time apart?!    You need to get uppity. you're the pregnant lady, throw in the crying/hormonal thing! Just get him to drive you to the baby shower, and if she tries to tell him to leave put your foot down and say NO, he is staying!    Hopefully you'll be overdue to be sure hubby is home! :D I wouldn't go anywhere without my hubby at 35 weeks pregnant... Just in case i popped. He should stay with you while he can.|`|AA11091233	Well first of all...congratulations on  your new little baby coming into the world.     I understand why your husband wants to be there...however...honestly...unless there are other men there...he is going to feel very uncomfortable and so will the ladies.    It is only a few hours for a party...so can you tell him to shop at target while you are gone? Maybe that would be a good time for him to just BE and play golf or hang out with some of his friends. That is good for him as well.    It isn't fair to be rude to your mom...she is doing this out the bottom of her heart...and she is going to be part of her grandchild's life right?  All these women are getting together to celebrate and give you presents....presents are always a good thing!!! lol    This is not about your mom getting her way...but even if she is old-fashioned...it is a time honored tradition all over the world. I have seen other husbands at these events and I felt so sorry for the guy and the company.     One thing in this life to learn is...you can't change anyone.  You are so fortunate to even have a mom who loves you so much and wants to be part of your life and your baby's life...she and the other ladies have put time and money into this celebration...so being rude because you can't see your husband for a few hours...is not going to go over well. It isn't the way you want to start things. You need family...especially once your husband is overseas. You can't tell them to stick it...but then call them when you need them when he is gone.    You can express your feelings about wanting to spend every moment with him while he is here...but just so that you are expressing it and just make the part only a few hours long....that way you can bow out. Women basically just want to bring the gifts, have some cake, have some ooing and ahhing over the gifts and then be on their way. Tell your mom how much you appreciate what she is doing...but just say how much you love your husband and want to be with him...so to please understand you don't want this party to go on for many hours.     Traditions are not meant as a means of control...but celebration. I feel you should accept gracefully...but explain why you want to bow out after a few hours. Your husband won't mind I'm sure...or you can see if the other ladies will get some of their hubbies to come too...that way the guys can hang out in the background...and not have to play those silly games. Those silly games are the 'traditions' that drive me nuts and I absolutely hate!     Unless you want to end up a lonely new mommy...don't burn your bridges honey...and if your mom said he couldn't be in the delivery room...then it's just old school thinking...it's not her fault..so forgive her and accept her and let those types of things roll off your back. Unless she is directly doing something to break up your marriage or totally take over your whole life and interfere in raising your child...love her....none of us know how long any of us will be here on earth...so we need to seize each moment like it's the last....and be happy you have people that love you so much.    Hope this helps.    Take good care of you and hope your delivery goes smoothly. You are a brave woman...and your husband is a hero.    : ' )|`|5WP9rLTlaa	she expects you to ditch him on one of his very rare days of leave!? what a nasty so and so!  I'd be telling her that you are spending his leave days with him and if she wants to hold a function that requires you to ditch him she can reschedual or you won't go to it. tell her that pleasing her is no longer your first priority- bubby comes first, then hubby and then her.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Your mother needs to relax.|`|L5xLdtVcaa	even though your mom and them are throwing the shower it is still your baby shower and you have a say on who comes and who doesn't come. I say either talk to them and tell them that you want to include your husband in the pregnancy or just show up with him. They cant get mad at you, its your baby shower!! good luck and congrats on the pregnancy!|`|fQgbBx7caa	Hello guys do to attend a baby shower, have the other womens husbands come over too....she will just have to get over it, if not oh well for her.|`|nGmQQERUaa	tell her exactly what you told us that he needs to be involved in somethign if hes not going to be there for the delivery|`|R3E8DkTfaa	Your mother is right, he doesn't belong there.  I find it very hard to believe that your husband truly wants to be at a baby shower.  I'm not saying that he isn't excited about the baby, nor that he doesn't want to be involved in as many aspects of the birth as possible.  But there is no way that he actually wants to hang out with a bunch of women talking about how cute this baby outfit is and adorable that stuffed animal is.  Your mother is the one that is throwing this for you and you should respect her on this.  If you are honest about it, the idea of having him there is probably more yours than his, and if you let him off the hook, your husband is most likely going to be relieved. He may not admit it openly right now, but someday he will.    EDIT: I see that I have been outnumbered by estrogen. But no matter how many thumbs downs I may receive it doesn't make me wrong.|`|AA11637178	Don't tell them. Then take him with you!! Show up there with him. And let them tell him he can't be there (in front of everyone else) You got to be strong and don't let them push you around. Remember your a military wife and we are strong(30 years here). Our men need to know we can handle what ever comes our way!!! That includes mommy. And I am a southern bell myself.|`|j8jF8so7aa	I would stand firm on having your husband there. It should be YOUR choice!! If she doesn't want him there then I wouldn't go either. Point blank. Good luck and if you need any support check out HeartsOfOurTroops.com. The women are amazing and a lot have gone through birth alone.Good Luck!!
LsDdJlDgaa	why not............. laila sarina.nice name.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Lilah but I do not get how you are getting Sah ree nah  there is no h any where to make that sound  to me it is sar ina|`|tLXD3yOWaa	is the last one a typo??  and I like Lilah Sarina :D|`|wziUVyVoaa	If you spell it Lilas Sarina, it won't be pronounced LYE LAH anymore. It'll be LYE LASS. Personally, Lilah Sarina is my favorite. I think it's very, very pretty. It's easier to read and pronounce and whatnot. It reminds people more of Delilahs, which are beautiful.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	Lilas Serena. it reminds me of the moonlight.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I like the second one the best I think|`|2l636NUvaa	Lilah Sarina looks best to me.|`|5T4r0Geiaa	lila sarina|`|VnOnxZcyaa	You should name your little girl Lucia, because every guy loves Latina.|`|AA11075313	i think it should be Lilaa  Sarina|`|5AnQQyefaa	Lilah Sarina   will help people enunciate  the name much easier.    I like Lilas but, the only bad thing about  it is it make it sound like  Li lahs Sah ree nah    But if thats what you're looking for;  Go For It|`|CRFLKFenaa	Lila Sarina (however I would consider changing Sarina to Serena). If you chose the last one people will assume you pronounce it with an 's' on the end.Hope this helps!|`|SxbSb0zuaa	I like number 2. Lilah Sarina. I think it is pretty.|`|4LbVbJQXaa	even though Lilas Sarina is your favorite..the teachers through out her life will ruin it ..i would know..my name is nikolia and people always say NICK-O-LYE-UH....its just NICK-O-LYE!!! so dont be fancy with the extra silent letter.....  it looks nice, but it will haunt her like it haunts me..haha ..go with Lilah Sarina (very cool name)|`|LgLpJxnwaa	Lilah sarina is much nicer.    Lilas.. type ??  if its not, its really bad.
AA11840819	It should not be too long.  It depends on your body. Everyone is different.  The fact that your cervix has thinned out and the baby has moved into birthing positions means it should be the next few weeks. Sometimes you need help dilating, they will give you a shot to help with the process if needed.  Having a baby is the most miraculous thing a woman goes through.  It hurts yes but to see that beautiful baby and know you are the one who made him or her is just a miracle.  Good luck and congratulations|`|1CryEnb3aa	Everyone is different.  Can't really answer that for you.  Sounds close though.  Good luck and congrats!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Could be anytime could be weeks...Everyone is different hun.
yhGJ2Shjaa	Don't breed, you make my head hurt.|`|Bt3857hxaa	Take the test after your miss period. Onces you relize you skip your period...go take the test.     You can get the test 5 days sooner after your miss pms|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	take one bout two weeks after the first time i had sex and so on|`|vv6SZgZAaa	How old are you?? 2wks...
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period. Sperm can hang out waiting for an egg for up to 72 hours.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There really isn't any such thing as "safe" unless you test for ovulation but even then you could ovulate after you test and have sex and still get pregnant. Ovulation can occurr at ANY time during your cycle so no. Use a condom. There is no "safe" time.|`|FmKsR3lNaa	It's never 100% "safe" pregnancy wise, but you should ALWAYS use some kind of birth control (condom / pill) no matter what stage you are at in your cycle.|`|t1WOxnI8aa	No it's not. The only safe guard from pregnancy and STD's is abstinence. However using a condom can aid in safety.
xBW4saqgaa	women are fertile when they ovulate and only then can they get pregnant otherwise no chance and as for periods no way.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They CAN if the ovulate at different times but if you ovulate on a regular cycle then no.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Women conceive when they ovulate, when the ovary releases a ripe egg. This egg is only usually released once during the month, and only lives for about 24-48 hours. Most women ovulate during the very middle of the cycle, when counting the first day of the period as day 1, women usually ovulate between days 12-18, but not all women fit this model and MANY women can ovulate irregularly during the month, including during their period.     So it is not true that a woman can conceive at any time, a woman can conceive when she ovulates, the trick is knowing when ovulation is happening. Most women don't know. Which is why you should always use birth control, every time, to avoid pregnancy.|`|AA11763588	Most women ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day they start their period.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Not impossible but mostly they conceive about 14 days after the first day of bleeding. In between periods, in other words.|`|AA10876206	usually, a woman cannot conceive during their period.  The odds are astronomical against it.    Just so you know though, there are dangers to the rhythm method.  For example, sperm can stay alive in the vaginal canal for days... so even if you cannot conceive the day you have sex, you might still become impregnated a couple of days later.|`|Rl0tWTBsaa	I have very irregular periods, usually only coming 3-4 times a year. I haven't had a period for about 5 months and I just found out that I am 6 weeks pregnant so I'd say it could happen at any time.|`|Tgt3cRF7aa	anytime baby|`|bqshcDJSaa	No.
3dSCbIcEaa	it depends on where u r at- at home it lies at about 1% and at the hospital it is 40% bc the docs r more likely to order an unnecessary c section|`|JDtWdfhIaa	between 0-100%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
hKJIDdVqaa	yeah I have a suggestion, put a motion detector alarm the laser kind across their bedroom door. when they cross the laser an alarm will go off. Scaring them and alerting you.  It is dangerous for them to wander.  That should solve the problem.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Well there has to be a punishment which will actually work - you need to be consistent. You've tried so many things.. but you just need to stick with one of them (whichever one they liked the least, preferably).<br>  <br>  You could put a baby monitor in their bedroom to stop them in their tracks. There are child-proof fridge locks available with number combinations actually. I'm sure a google search would find you one.. but before going to extreme measures just try consistent punishment and a baby monitor. <br>  <br>  I'm surprised your kids have so much energy in the middle of the night! Do they go back to sleep afterward? Our 5 and 6 1/2 year old sleep well through the night and would be quite annoyed if they were woken up too soon. Perhaps try a later bedtime for your boys?|`|0vLU2GGGaa	go to the store and get this cool baby gadget, it is a door alarm you can stick on the door, one side on the door, one side on the door frame, so whenever the door is being opened, it will alarm.  I have one when my daughter was toddler, she likes to open the front door and go out by herself, and this alarm thing worked very well.  You can try to stick it on their bedroom doors, cabinet doors etc.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	wow little twirps lol<br>   i have heard od a bell that rings when the door opens I think ppl get them for robbers . Put on there door to wake you . Are they ADD or something ? u moght want to talk to there dr. about this as they should be more tired <br>  If they arent maybe work there tiny bums off during the day and have them play with no sit down things like games and tv<br>  bless your heart it wil be ok|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Get a door with a lock on it and put it on backwards so you can only lock it from the outside of the door.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	Are you sure it's not sleep walking?<br>  <br>  (the first thing I thought of when I read that is the scene in Stepbrothers when they're sleepwalking)|`|xH6PQRrmaa	have you asked them why they have been behaving in this manner ?<br>  maybe hide all the things im a locked room and see what happens .<br>  <br>  good luck with it?<br>  xoxo|`|15qceXaOaa	give them a spanking|`|ThnKiLfTaa	For every action there has to be an equal or greater reaction....<br>  There MUST be consequences to disobedience! That is the one thing in my house that is UNACCEPTABLE! If you out right disobey me there WILL be consequences. Whether it be time out, loosing privileges, grounding, spanking whatever is the appropriate punishment for the offense. <br>  The first thing you need to do is set the rules, the boundaries. And then enforce them! And be consistent! You can't slack even one time because if your kids sense softness on your part then they will take advantage of it. <br>  Try this..... tell your kids the rules, your expectations. Let them get something to drink before they go to bed, and maybe even have an evening snack before bed time so that way their not hungry. Then tell them after they go to bed they are NOT to get back up unless it is to potty and then straight back to bed until the morning. Tell them if they do then the next night they will have to go to bed 30 mins early and they are not allowed privileges during the day like video games or computer time or t.v or whatever you feel is appropriate to take away. And tell them if they do it again another night then they will go to bed an hour early and they will lose privileges for 2 days.... so on and so forth. I guarantee they will get sick of going to bed early and losing privileges and they will give up!!!! The key is being consistent with your rules and never allowing disobedience!!!
Y27SeLvxaa	Maybe have him watch some birthing videos with you and once he get the feel of how special that moment will be he will get over his fears and man up! ;)  Good luck!|`|4jW9rERFaa	Explain to him how you feel about it. Let him know you would be hurt not to have him there and that this is a once in a life time thing. This is his first kid (I think, but I don't know your situation entirely so forgive me if i am wrong on that)! He doesn't have to watch the baby come out. He can stand at your side and not see a thing that's going on down there while you are in labor. As far as him seeing you lactate I can see that as a turn of for a male, but thats part of life and you can't exactly hide it from him so he should get over it!|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	If you want to have more children and continue having sex with your partner, I'd say let him be AT the hospital.<br>  Some men are completely scared of pregnancy...not just of the responsiblity but seeing something THAT graphic come out of you... can put a man off having sex ever again.<br>  Comprimise. Don't let him near where he'd be able to see the baby come out... make him hold your hand, rub your back and be with you up top while the professionals get down there.<br>  I do reccommend showing him a movie of women giving birth, your style is excellent, I might try it with my hubby :P|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think he needs to suck it up.  Your need for him to be there and to see his first child should out weigh his fears.  I mean, come on.  You have to do all the work, the least he could do is be there to offer you the support!!  I'd get militant with him.|`|vZaLptZWaa	What about if he leaves for the delivery. Or if you PROMISE he can stay by your head and see only what you see. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, the last thing you want is him fainting and taking away your attention, right?|`|52U22fiAaa	He needs to grow up.  It's not "gross stuff" it's a live birth.  Just ask him to be there, he doesn't even have to look at it down there.  If you are going through it, he should support you!!!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	just tell him to stay by your side and he won't have to see anything "mucus gross stuff" lol|`|HMPdnhApaa	Do you mean "scaredy cat" ? ?    Um he can just stay up my your head if he does not want to see the "mucous gross stuff".  My husband didn't want to see the baby actually coming out either...but I'd be damned for him to tell me he wasn't coming in the room with me! He needs to be there for you!|`|xWkf8jxkaa	You need to talk to him and let him know that you need him there. Tell him that if he can do the job and get you pregnant, then he can be there for the birth. As gross as it seems that is a moment that he will not want to miss. Tell him he can turn around but at least be in the room. Don't put him in front of the couch and make him watch other women give birth, but talk to him and get him to understand your part. Bring up the point he thinks its gross to watch, but you have to go through it. If nice does not work, you may have to be firm and tell him to man up and tell him that he will be there whether he likes it or not. Hope this helps and good luck with your baby and convincing the father to just grin and bear it.
GWveqx61aa	i dont think you can, if i were you id talk to your dr and ask him to put you on provera and clomid, the provera is to induce period, clomid to induce ovulation, or vitex and soy isoflavones, but you dont need to see a dr for these, take vitex everyday as directed, thats supposed to regulate you and than take soy isoflavones on days cd3-7 to help induce ovulation. dont stop taking the vitex. you can get these at the vitamin/health store for less than 20 dollars for both of these._good luck and baby dust to us all_

Put them in brown lunch bags and staple the top shut. Than put a number on each bag. At the party you give each guest a piece of paper and pen/pencil. They number their piece of paper 1-10 or 1-12 depending on the number items in bags. You pass the bags around and people feel the bag and guess what items are in there. Than they write it down.

If it was only 5 day ago it hard to tell spotting wouldn't occur until later in the pregnancy! If you are pregnant your body goes Thur changes right away, like feeling sick, your boobs hurt and you are tired you can also feel like you are having cramps and not have a period! The best thing to do is go to the Dr and get a pregnancy test and if you are not comfortable doing that go to a health clinic, they can give you lots of information and a pregnancy test (I'd recommend get test for STD as well) it is confidential, oh and why you are there get some info on birth control!!!!
AA11688420	WHAT??   I could NEVER give birth without my husband there.  He will be the ONLY one in the room with me that is not a nurse or doctor.  I hate doctors and the only way I can ever get through anything like that is if he was by my side holding my hand.  I can't imagine a woman actually kicking the babys father out of the room.  Did she allow other people in the room - such as her parents or your parents?  If she did that then that really ****** up.  If she kicked everyone out maybe it was just a heat of the moment she got claustrophic and wanted you  out but its not personal. <br>  <br>  About the birth certificate - that's a whole other story.  Um - maybe the baby isn't yours - she didn't even want you to see it?  Good sign right there that she had some OTHER guys name on there.  Get a DNA test on that baby right away or else demand the truth before you get stuck paying dipaers and child support for a baby that's not yours!  Sounds like she's using you.|`|AA10568752	probably for many of reasons. for one the baby's father could be a butt head. I'm pregnant and due in Oct. and my baby's father is a serious a** hole that doesn't care about me or my child! he don't call or come around. has another girlfriend that he cares more about than his child, and has just done me wrong through out my whole pregnancy. so I'm not allowing him to be in the delivery room. hes also changed his number so i have no way of contacting him. but im going to give the baby his last name though. some girls don't because maybe they're on welfare and doesn't want the dude to pay child support.idk.another reason could be because either the girls not sure of who the baby belongs to or because he have put her through alot or the dudes denying their child. everyone has their own opinion.|`|AA11388887	I don't know the answer to the rest of the question but as for why she can kick him out, some women "blame" the MAN and SHE is the one IN PAIN so she has EVERY right to kick him out!  I asked my fiance what he would do, he said he wouldn't leave unless the doctor dragged him out and he is a BIG man!  LOL!<br>  <br>  The rest of your question makes NO SINCE!|`|d781489452cedd061dd0baf8f455d2b7aa	I think women are scared that the man is going to want full custody of the child and they are scared that they may lose their child. i don't think that that is a fair reason, but i know it happens|`|5c89fb1b615f8de2d5f26b1a9648bdeaaa	First, when it comes to labor and delivery a woman needs and deserves the most relaxing and supportive environment possible while delivery a baby.  The more relaxed she is the easier the labor will be for both mother and baby, so if she wants you there or doesn't want to see you it really is up to her.<br>  Second I dont know what state you live in but in NJ the fathers name on the birth certificate is automatically the husband.  If the mother is unwed the name can ONLY be put on the brth cert if the man is present and willing to sign.<br>  Third I know when I was pregnant i did alot of things that were emotional and irrational If she loves you and you are a good man hopefully things will work out, after all the baby's name can always be changed.  Good Luck|`|AA10113500	well we get to go through caring them for 9 months so i think it is right if we get to make the decision on how we want the paper to show  but i do know you can get it changed by getting a blood test done|`|AA12358981	Lets start with the 1st part.... why can she kick him out? because labor is so stressful... any little thing can set her off.. making her unable to concentrate on the contractions making labor harder and possibly dangerous for both mother and baby.. so basically if God himself was upsetting a laboring woman... he would be kicked out too.... as far as the rest of your question sounds to me like you might want to get some proof that it is your child before looking for deeper answers.|`|AA10636233	I guess it's the same reason that guys get to claim that the baby is not theirs and that the mother is promiscuous. The same law that won't allow mothers to list the father's name on the birth certificate even if they know he is the father, they need his permission first. So I guess the law figured it needed to balance things out somehow. As for the delivery room, I am tempted not to let my husband in for the next one. It is her body, and she already shared it with you once, but you must have done something to make her not want to become that exposed around you again. Deal with it, and if you really want to be a father to this baby, then I suggest you start by sending diapers and formula to the hospital instead of flowers, and then keep making the attempts, and if that doesn't work, then maybe you should seek legal advice.|`|c42feb76aceaf22103d8434abc26ce57aa	You should think about the types of women that do this.  I had my husband in there with me, and my kids have his last name, as do I.  Yep, you're sleeping with the WRONG women if they do this to you.
7bdhpvc9aa	I think you should get a second opinion from another doctor. You know your child better than anyone and if you still think something is wrong and that something should be done then it is best that you get your daughter checked by another pediatrician for another opinion. Good Luck and I pray that there is nothing wrong with her. God Bless|`|An8rT0WMaa	do you mean when did they start? My daughter started walking around 10 almost 11 months. She says a couple words but i dont think it's intentional and shes almost a year old.|`|AA10442322	My eldest daughter had the same problem. She refused to speak and we were worried. We consulted her doctor and he told us she was developing fine. No cause for concern.     Eventually, she started speaking and we were all relieved. I supposed we exposed her to lots of television programs to start her off the language track - kids programs. Now, she is such an eloquent and articulate little girl that you simply cannot believed it if we have told you she didn't speak a word when she was a lot younger.|`|412167FVaa	Please do follow your gut instinct concerning this princess,however bear in mind that every child develops in a unique way and the fact that you say " she has been developing normal"  is a very good indicator that she is following "her  route". She seems like a chosy gal cos you do mention that when she likes you she talks to you!    Good luck|`|AA10167940	My 6 year old did not speak until he was 4.

BM3l5xxhaa	I'd start worrying if you miss it for like two weeks. Loads of things could be causing you to be late... Being too thin, for example, can cause you to miss your period, and so can being pregnant. Maybe try to consider if anything has changed lately, and try to see if that's the cause...|`|e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	The pain in your back and legs may be a signal that your period is coming.

If you have, ide sujest buying some pregancy testers.|`|UQTktOw3aa	well if yu have missed yur period maybe yu are pregnant if yu had sex if not then its normal yur bodys trying 2 find a usual pattern|`|f4x7V1sZaa	the preg hormone doesnt register in your body stongly enough for it to show up on home preg test until about 3 weeks after conception.  So i would wait 3 weeks from the time you had sex.      And i feel you pain...... im going through the EXACT same thing right now! .... im just trying to wait out my 3 weeks :/|`|2C5PAfaZaa	Yep - you could have taken it a week ago at the earliest so it should show up now|`|AWdUdVD4aa	What Leah said is untrue. From the moment the sperm meets the egg and the egg is fertilized, it takes anywhere from 5-12 days for the egg to implant into your uterus. Your body starts making the pregnancy horomone hCG the moment the egg burrows into the uterine wall. Every other day the level of hCG in your system doubles. On about day 2 of your pregnancy, your hCG levels are normally at a 25, which is enough for the very strong Early Response HPT's to pick up on.    Do you know exactly what day you ovulated on? Do you know how long your normal Luteal Phase is? Alot of women, assume that they are late for their periods when in fact they aren't. Most times ovulation has occured late and your cycle won't start over until your normal LP is over.    I would recommend waiting to test however until you are at least 18 days past your ovulation day. If you chart your BBT and know exactly how long your luteal phase is, then it would be ok to test a day after your normal LP ends. For me it's around 12 days, but this past cycle through me for a loop and I was 15 days past O and no AF.    If you want to test now, I don't see any big deal in it. If you get a BFN and AF still does not arrive, wait a few more days and test again. Hope this helps any and I pray you get your BFP soon.
HclKftzAaa	go halfway, and just part with what you can. :)    hopefully you'll make enough money from the other stuff you'll be selling, so you can hang onto this stuff.    You wouldn't be able to get enough money to make it worth parting with something you're emotionally attached too.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I didn't read most of your details. I'm sorry. But I think you should keep your stuff until you KNOW someone who will benefit from these things:) That way you will free better about yourself and giving your kids old stuff that they won't fit in, nor use anymore, to someone who could really use them. But when you do buy new things for your next baby, slowly get rid of these things. Example: You buy a bedding, purge the old one. You have to force yourself too. I hope you can! After all, it's just stuff. You keep the child and give the hand-me-down's to those in need.|`|9rTeVPqBaa	well i would keep most if not all of the items, at least all of ur daughters!  maby sell some or all of the boys clothes, as when or if u have a boy u can go out and buy him all his own stuff, and then after that when you have another one:):) you will have both girl and boy items that will get passed down from brother/sister!    all of my friends have this thing, when they have a baby and when the clothes do not fit them anymore they pass them to another friend and so on.... you see i like to keep my own baby things.....i have kept ALL of my 20 month old daughters items(apart from a couple things that had stains all over them)
HclKftzAaa	The baby doesn't need the water to survive. the amniotic sack and fluid is there to protect the baby, not to nourish it. It gets everything it needs from the placenta.    Because of the risk of infection once the water breaks, most docs will induce within 24 hrs.    Don't worry, you usually still have some time if your water breaks before contractions start. :D Good luck!|`|QY10Hmq7aa	After your water breaks they try to have the baby delivered within 24 hours because the risk of infection.|`|UAunAKdtaa	dont worry. my water broke one day when we were at the beach enjoying sun baths. i didnt get to the hospital until later in the evening. (nurse told me i had 24 hours to deliver) so i went for a pad, then an ice cream, and then i decided it was time to go check it out. i had my baby 23 hours after the water broke.so they can hold pretty well. amazing, aint it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You will know ahead of time before your water breaks. You will lose your mucus plug and have your bloody show. So if you would like stay in a hotel closer to the hospital during that last week,might be a good idea.      _fyi_  For most women contractions can start pretty quickly after your water breaks,so you might WANT to be closer to the hospital.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Most Dr's try to deliver the baby with in 24hrs because there is a higher risk of infection however your water can replenish some and your baby wont be with no water and there is no such thing as a dry birth.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	After your water breaks you have 24 hours to deliever. If not you're running at risk for yourself and your baby of getting infections.|`|Bt3857hxaa	with in 24 hours|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	24hrs.|`|WD6OUUDZaa	you'll be fine! my water broke at 4am and we didn't get to the hospital until around 7am. i was in labor for over 20 hours and pushing for around 5 and then baby came! once your water breaks they'll induce labor if needed and get the baby out. the baby is without the water, but the umbilical cord is still getting him everything he needs. the big issue is infection.  good luck to you!!
UUpsa35Daa	They're for troubled teens that parents just feel like they can't control anymore. Usually it's violent teens or ones use drugs often...overly promiscuous teens etc. There are a number of reasons why they're sent.    And halfway houses are places that provide discipline and constructive full days. They teach them responsibility and respect. The teens will reach a point where teachers and the "head" of the establishment decide that they're ready to return home so they'll "graduate" and head back to their family.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	They are an alternative to jail and, prison.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	They get sent there because the parents obviously were not doing such a good job of looking after them.

(gross, but tons of ppl do it lol)  baby oil (may cause irritation, but may still be safe)    You'd be better off all around if you could get some KY or something similar though.|`|29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	Since you put this in the trying to conceive section, I thought I should tell you that most things will kill sperm, including spit, water, and most store bought lubes.    If you are trying to conceive there are a couple of lubes available, like Pre-Seed.  Other than that, I wouldn't trust it.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I wouldn't recommend it.  If you've got vaseline (petroleum jelly) you could use that, but NEVER with condoms as it tends to weaken them and makes them break easier.  You could also try a moisturiser, but it would dry out quick and is not good for internal use.  Olive or vegi oils are a really bad idea - they are really not designed to go into a vagina, shouldn't be used with condoms and are a quick way to vaginal infection.    The problem with anything homemade is that the vagina can be rather sensitive.  Anything with sugar can upset the normal balance and cause thrush - other ingredients can also cause this and other problems of infections. Food based things aren't meant to go in a vagina.    Just go to the shop and spend a couple of dollars on a good water-based lubricant - there is less chance of problems and you know that it will do the job you want it to.|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	Just buy some KY Jelly or some Astroglide.  Using petroleum based products will damage condoms, and other products or substances could cause damage.|`|wLChaSKfaa	the only thing i know of that doesnt impair sperms ability to swim if you are trying to conceive is baby oil.|`|AA11840819	I have to agree with the other person who said vagina's are self lubricating.  Maybe a little more foreplay and you may not need anything. Working too hard to get pregnant sometimes takes all the fun out.  Try to make it romantic and take your time with one another.  Good Luck!|`|2C5PAfaZaa	dont use oil|`|XBemRvIEaa	Egg white. No bullshit.

How long have you been trying? They don't label you as having fertility problems until you've been trying for a year.

b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Sounds like neither one of you need to be naked near one another. All is takes is one sperm to get her pregnant. She needs to take a pee test over the counter to find out.  At that age the cycle can be irregular because her body is still developing.  BTW you DON'T need magnums if they are sliding off. Don't kid yourself.  Now go back and read your question to us - especially the last sentence. You may not be as ready as you think for the responsibility..|`|1CryEnb3aa	Just relax.  You won't know until her period comes.  Next time, don't give in if you don't have the proper protection.  You don't want to be a teenage dad yet do you?  Just tell your girlfriend to get back on the pill and you will not have sex again unless you both are properly protected.  Be careful.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	You think precum only contains sperm if you ejaculate prior to sex and don't pee or wash? you are sadly mistaken. a drop of precum can contain 40 millions spermies! yay!  Look at this fool:   http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/s...    Also, pulling out isn't effective, nor is it even a method of birth control.     Please educate yourself before you go on to have anymore sexual escapades. The fact that you have improper knowledge irks me more than the fact that you are having sex at 16 years old and could have an std, sti or a baby on the way.    You also did it at prime ovulation time *easiest to get pregnant*.She will not even know she is pregnant untill she misses her period for sure. Symptoms do not occur untill about 6 weeks.     I feel bad for you- definately something to worry about for the next few weeks I guess, huh?       P.S. there's only a 2mm difference between magnums and regs so don't get too high and mighty on me now;)    EDIT: That's one study compared to oh, a million. But you know what- YOU go by THAT and tell me how many kids you have 5 girlfriends from now. :) I want you too. Really. Good luck Daddio.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	sex = baby, if she doesnt get her period get her to take a test|`|L5xLdtVcaa	ok first of all no matter what pre c*m has sperm in it and there is a chance that she could be pregnant, if she hasn't had her period yet. Go buy her a home pregnancy test (get pack of 2 or 3 and digital are the best-clear blue easy digital) have her take one as soon as possible. if it comes up negative and she still doesn't have her period wait a week or so and have her take another. Also make sure she takes them in the morning on her "first pee of the day"! hope everything goes ok! good luck!|`|WFxVuM1Laa	Congrats Dude!  i tried all those things too and now my girlfriend turned fiance is 21 wks prego! im 31 and it still scared the hell out of me,its our first. lots of tests can tell now if she is or not... Good Luck!!|`|Rl0tWTBsaa	When me and my boyfriend have sex he always pulls out in plenty of time and just two days ago I found out I was pregnant. That's why it's called the pull and pray because there's really no way to know for certain. The best thing to do is just wait and see if her next period comes and if not then y'all need to buy a test.
1CryEnb3aa	Could be implantaion bleeding.  Not like a real period.  You may have a mucus like mixed with light blood..  Kinda brownish/pinkish.  Shouldn't last long at all.  Not all women get this and not with every pregnancy. Timing sounds right for implantation too.   When your period is actually due and no AF, take a test.  Good luck|`|Bt3857hxaa	It means your pregnant.... congratulation|`|xHKRGEg4aa	could be implantation bleeding.  could be rough sex(no offense)  good luck
8pup9oWhaa	this happened to me, i thought i broke it but it was fine.    first take it all part, there is a mini sponge in the back which soaks up the milk-this needs to be fully dried out- leave it to dry overnight. the tube needs to be cleaned to, you can attach it to the pump but to nothing for the other end, turn the pump on for 2 mins (or for the entire first pumping action before it changes to letdown) and let the air clear any condensation. put it all back together and hey presto!    good luck|`|EMKuBql8aa	Ah! I know this answer cause my wife had that pump too and I fixed it for her many times, lol.     You need to first air out everything, take it apart as much as possible and let it sit on the counter overnight. You know the little flap thing, replace it and make sure the clear tube thing is on correctly when using it.|`|c1a3b5ba51837338ef1572e22d49dfdaaa	be careful... u can burn out the motor... make sure milk doesnt get in it anymore.... those pumps cost too much
WhpM78DEaa	i would not risk it, call your doctor, specially since the baby is due tomorrow. most likely they will tell you not to worrie, and its normal, but hey atleast you checked. better safe than sorry.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nothing. It will happen when it happens which will most likely be soon. REST and sleep. You're going to need your strength in the coming days.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	You can relax and wait for the contractions. Good luck.|`|h6lZKeyRaa	Get to the hospital right now dumbass!|`|AA10104531	Just kick back and relax and enjoy the last good rest you will get for a very long time, lol.   Didn't your doctor give you any information about this?  Didn't you read any books on pregnancy?  If so, you should know the answer to your question.  Give your doctor's office a call during the day if you haven't started contracting and ask them how long to wait if nothing is happening.|`|44d4b36f4aabc30ce6e140dbe4eab408aa	hey im excited for you.. i have 5 weeks left and cant wait until im that close in having my baby lol....  so what color is the discharge tho? like is it a normal discharge, bloody or what? usually that means that labor is coming if the discharge is colored. but not having thatmuch info is pretty hard. you should call the  hospital and ask to be transfered to labor and delivery speak to a nurse tell her whats going on and see what she says. thats what i always do for all my questions and concerns the nurses are very helpful.. like they will be straight up and tell you like what to do or either come to hospital or calm down its nothing...... and i just thought,... maybe your plug is coming in pieces.... well good luck to you and baby|`|ii0C0tfXaa	Relax! Im sure you know that being due tomorrow may or may not happen...and only 5% of women deliver on their due date. You can lose your plug up to eleven days before you go into labor. Good luck...and congrats :-) best wishes to you and your baby to be|`|AA11762804	Call you doctor ASAP, he/she might want you to go to the hospital or wait till mornig and have you come in to see them|`|gM0RMviAaa	call your doc to see what she or he wants to do or if ur doc isnt on call talk to the on call they can tell u what u need to do
fTLzKg5Eaa	Seeing your Other Questions I think you dont want to avoid it but want to actually stop it yourself, If so I hope it will hurt a lot and damage your health, Good day to you|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There are so many things that can be harmful you may want to call your doctor and get a list from him or her.|`|x6IyESABaa	Quite a lot. some are harmful in high dosage. while some you should avoid.  example, smoking, drugs    Try this website  http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhe...|`|AA11762804	crack, meth, other street drugs, alcohol, bank robberies.....lol      just joaking, smoking, drinking, to much caffeine can cause a miscarriage|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Smoking, all pills, drugs, alcohol,caffeine certain sports, like bike riding or water ski. There is allot of things, ask your doctor.  Good luck.|`|CVA86LY6aa	you have posted 3 questions in a row about harming a pregnancy, the effects of wine, and anti pregnancy pills, are you trying to have a miscarriage? or trying to avoid one? I'm confused!   You can im or email me if you'd like to talk.|`|vUpG1XOXaa	The way you asked this question makes me wonder if the reason you are asking the question is to END your pregnancy.      Keep in mind, if you UNSUCCESSFULLY try to terminate, you can really hurt the baby.  Which means that at the end you end up having the baby, but with problems,      Now if you just asked the question JUST TO ASK... then basically anything that you think may hurt the baby... probably will.
db17fabf0780755dd8df8c51bfdb141daa	You did exactly the right thing...using the nasal aspirator.  It's best to wipe any you can see with a cloth/kleenex then if there is still milk visible or the baby sounds like there is, use the nasal aspirator.  You don't leave it up to something like sneezing.  You did good.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think the aspirator is all you can do; quickly close off the other nostril while u release the bulb...|`|lADq4dNdaa	i know this sounds really gross, but suck it out.  hes only a baby, and its only milk, so its not too bad.  but it really works and is safe! they do it in the islands when their babies are sick and mucusy.  :)
HclKftzAaa	my nephew and my sister did this too! lol. Something about the door frames! hahaha.    I am still pregnant, and when baby is kicking and rolling about i wonder what they're thinking. 'Hmmm, what happens if i squeeze this?' No no no! can't breath if i do that! ahaha. hmmm, what noises happen if i kick here?!!! *kick*    "oh no, i have to pee!"    Ahahaha.|`|50lIaC8zaa	My DD does it too she laughs and babbles at the ceiling at my friends house, its really weird and its the only place she does it. I wonder who shes talking to??  :s|`|sAAnquoTaa	Gosh yes!!! Every day! I really want to know what she dreams of too.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	awww bless her lol.     did u watch shameless on tuesday?? the new baby stella was communicating through 'baby telapathy' lol (however u spell it )    wonder if she's thinking 'this is so different to my last view' lol xxxxx|`|eO429roGaa	Yes    The little bugger outwits me all the time.|`|ugQPb744aa	N'aww, 2 weeks old, how precious.    I always wonder what my cat is thinking, but they are far superior to humans ;)|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	she's not looking at the ceiling she is looking at ghosts.|`|oHV95EFLaa	i always wonder what my son is thinking, because he always looks angry!|`|LHOXXHMnaa	My daughter was is 10 weeks and she does the exact same thing.She stares at our ceiling fan in our living room for minutes at a time.I'm thinking the gold catches her attention because it's shiny.But when she's sleep and she smiles and open her eye,lol notice I said eye,because it's only the right eye!But mine look at the ceiling all the time and smile.|`|AA10368053	I would kill to know what my 4 1/2 year old step son is thinking sometimes. But mainly cause he has down syndrome and it would be interesting to see what anyone like that is thinking. But I do have a picture on my wall of a fairy its call midsummer eve and my 3 week old LOVES that picture. He will be crying and he hold him up to the picture close enough that he can see it and he will calm right down at least long enough for me to make him a bottle.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	I do often wonder what she is thinking. My DD is 7 1/2 months old right now and I know what she is thinking every time I put her down "What do you think you are doing, COME AND PICK ME BACK UP RIGHT NOW LADY!" LOL. She is going through a very attachment fase. But when I am holding her she looks around everywhere and makes faces at the weirdest things.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Sign with them from when they're little, then you'll know!!    My daughter was pointing at a chair, and we were all saying "yes, chair"  but then she signed flowers. And sure enough the chair had flowers all over.    My brother always said they were thinking about shapes!!|`|DbUjVVFSaa	i do all the time. my daughter has done the same thing ever since she was a newborn. shes like fascinated with the ceiling :) & i always wonder what she dreams about too.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My 1 year old: " Oooh, that is so cool when I throw mommy's soup ladle in the garbage, look at her reaction!"    My 2 year old: " I betcha if i spin in circles, dad will laugh and join me."|`|hwQoOSfRaa	Oh yes all the time.  She's 5 months old and pulls the silliest faces and raspberry's.  My fave is when she pulls my head in, and raspberry's on my cheek.  The concentration on her face to do it is fantastic.  I'd love to know what's going through her head then, oh and when she's trying to get the zip on a coat or something.  She stares at it so much, lines her hand up to it, then misses totally. lol.    On the other hand, sometimes I wish I didn't know what my 6 and 4 year olds were thinking !
VHHis05Naa	I'm not in my third yet, but I'm still sick now and then.  I'm almost 24 weeks.  I haven't gained any weight yet.  Sorry you're still sick.  It really stinks to be the one holding that lottery ticket.  :(|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife had that problem with our oldest, she did it so much/so long that she actually tore a hole in her throat from dry heaving, she woke up one morning barfing up blood. She used to sleep on the bathroom floor so she could be closer to the toilet, I joined her many nights, lol.     Keep your chin up, after you give birth, it just stops like that. You are almost there.|`|VPCVswkpaa	i threw up and was horribly nauseous the first three months it went away then came back the last 3 months.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	hey im only like 30 weeks pregnant but i know exactly how you feel! i dont actually throw up at home though which is horrible i wish i could sometimes just to give me a little bit of release but i throw up at work which is horrible coz im a check out chick!! i have really really bad reflux and interjestion as well but i guess it is my fault for falling pregnant LOL.  Not long to go now just try to think of it that way =]  Congrats on the bubba|`|CVA86LY6aa	Eat crackers, and soup, ramen always helped for me. ASk doctor if you can take tums or something like that!!!    Good Luck and congrats!!!|`|x6IyESABaa	I'm 25 weeks. I had little morning sickness in my 1st trimester. But recently I had my gastric juice kept coming up to my throat. I vomited a few times too. It happen really often at night and I can't sleep. It's really irritating!
2x41IPGcaa	yes. sounds u have have survived the 1st trimester. enjoy the 2nd and get as much sleep as u can in the third. good luck x|`|FegAXbgiaa	Hi    Once you get to between 12 -14 weeks nausea or sickness usually ends, but for a few it can carry on.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sounds like it! :) I'll cross my fingers for you!|`|WQR0KEqZaa	yes, your reaching the best weeks of being pregnant, when the sickness ends, make the most of feeling better before you get massive, no sleep and bach ache arrives!! lol.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	You lucky thing. It certainly does sound like the dreaded morning sickness is waving goodbye. I still get it even now at my late stage, and i'm starting to get sick and tired, of feeling sick and tired..|`|KsPp27CYaa	yep its cud be over now..lucky u|`|xV0APOtaaa	Probably. My daily morning sickness lasted my first trimester, then there were still a few select foods she decided she didn't like that still made me sick all the way up to delivery.
AA11795652	I had heard these silly stories too and I too only had experience with girls (I have a sister and no brothers) and had some concerns.  My son is 9 months old.  I never had to make sure his penis was in any particular position when diapering him and if he did get "stiff" due to being cold or otherwise, I still just put on the diaper like normal.  He's never leaked due to his penis being in the wrong position.  I thought that having a boy was going to be such a huge change and be so different than my daughter, but it's not.  You do have to wipe more like around the scrotum because poo likes to hide everywhere and in the beginning you might get squirted on but fairly quickly you forget that your baby boy has a penis and you just change them and bathe them without thinking about it.  My son likes to play with himself during diaper changes and my sister-in-law always tells him not to do that because she thinks he's pulling it too hard but according to my mom-in-law, that's what boys do.|`|B7nzW4Mcaa	No it doesn't matter were there pointing it just depends on the pamper how good it observes, as for stifffies yes it does happen it happens to every boy (it is normal) just leave it alone..  Remember if u don't circumcise him u gonna have to pull his skin back a lil cause it can close up & if the Dr. does it will hurt him more..  Didn't mean to scare u but it did happen to cousin son..|`|QM6wiVtVaa	The direction of the penis doesn't matter, as long as the diaper is put on properly to begin with.  It's normal for infants to get erections, and you shouldn't do anything about it, just go about changing him like you normally do.|`|JtYVYqqqaa	With my nephew he was leaking through his nappies for weeks, I kept suggesting to my sister to put his doodle down not up. When she finally did do this he stopped leaking. I only have 2 daughters so can't help anymore. than that. Good luck|`|zhqSxJS9aa	when my son was born till about 1 & 1/2 months if ti was pointing up pee came out the top of his nappy.  even with expensive brands and the nappies were put on correctly. and the stiffies are totally normal.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Other than making sure to keep his "private stuff" clean, there isn't much you have to do or worry about that area.|`|CxQ3XW4eaa	There not silly questions really, I have a boy of 5 and am expecting my next one in 7 weeks! I get a bit squeemish about changing girls but boys dont bother me - its weird.  The answers to your questions are yes and yes, when you change a boys nappy make sure his little one is down otherwise when he wee's its likely to come out of the nappy! and yes to your other question too.  It doesnt hurt them and you just quickly push it down then wrap the nappy around them.  Good luck and congrats!|`|Yn2n26zXaa	It doesn't have to be completely straight, but you should point it down. erections are completely normal. Just don't pay much attention to it. He he gets a little older, around four months for my son, they discover it and start grabbing it. Thats normal too and you shouldn't stop it. Even when they pull really hard on it. If it hurts them, they won't pull so hard next time. And someone told you the if you don't circumcise you need to retract the foreskin, but you do not ever do that. Even if the pediatrician says to. It's incredibly dangerous and can/will cause tearing. You just wipe it in the bath like you would a finger. The foreskin is attached to the penis much like a nail to your finger. It separates around the age of 2 on it's own. Good luck and congratulations!|`|ZjqdLSv2aa	I've changed many diapers and never had to worry about the direction the boys' package was pointing. The diaper is pressed right up to it and will absorb it.|`|XbsDGhmNaa	You might want to make sure it's pointing down when you put the diaper on or it could leak out the top when he pees. And yes, they do get those. It's best to just leave it alone. Trust me, those aren't silly questions, they're good ones.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I know how you feel, i just had my first boy 11 months ago after having 3 girls, no it doesnt matter if there penis is not strait when you put the nappy on, my lil boy has never wee'd out the side or anything and when they get lil stiffies you just leave it and put the nappy back on, it only lasts for a couple of sseconds anyway.    My baby boy used to always wee strait after his bath when i was drying him and he would wee on me every single time, he even wee'd on my within 5 minutes of being born.    Good Luck
HVXtd2Ryaa	It is horrible, everyday I see something new in the news about a child being beaten or killed by it's parents or a relative. Those twins that died, that caused a stir but only for a week or so - nothing more came of it.     I think a lot has to do with the uselessness of the Child Protective Services at the moment. I remember when I was younger our next door neighbour had 5 children, (she has about 9 now) and she was terrible. An alcoholic who didn't even slow down during pregnancy.     My mother and the neighbours aunt went into Child Services with a completely mouldy pillow that the youngest (5 months old) had been sleeping on, all their clothes were mouldy and the police were called out on a regular basis for physical fights between her and her boyfriends and her boyfriends and the children. Over the years several people 'dobbed' her in but all we ever got told was that they would 'put it in their files'. These included giving alcohol to her 6 month old and running over the kids pets to 'teach them a lesson'.    I think a lot of the time they wait until it's too late.    As for the parents I have absolutely no understanding of how they could do that to anyone - let alone their own children. The twins mother said that she left them to die because she had three other children and couldn't cope. Why not give them up for adoption? Why not drop them off at a hospital? It's something I will never be able to understand and in cases like the twins one I feel that the instigators of the crime should have to face the the same punishment.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	it absolutely horrifies me and i think the people that do this **** should be tortured it is horrible i dont know how anyone could harm poor innocent children, and even worse its the parents doing it|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Yes I saw that too. No excuse, that man needs a lot of help. Those young children will be traumatised for life.    The family of twins (I thought they were boys). That story hit hard here. I have twins not much older. It made me sad because the Mother was severely depressed, and actually reached out to an online site.  She  was hounded off the site, and I guess that made her snap. Since reading that, I watch my attitude on here. It would kill me to know when someone reached out for help, I abused them.    I could never hurt my Sons, and it hurts when I see these tragedies, but there is always a story underneath them|`|UMRdHuuVaa	i saw this today - i am an aussie.    It seems to be getting worse here, the case of shaylee ward where the idiot DOCS (department of children services) which i think the original asker was talking about - the girl was autistic i think and they locked her in her room, and starved her - when DOCS were told, they went in and took the wrong child!! a week later shaylee was dead.  Today, the maggot father threw his father off a bridge, and i heard one also where the mother tortured her baby to death, not sure if that was in australia.  It really makes me sick and angry - DOCS are so useless!!  I knew people who worked for docs and were so lazy, and i know of a case near where i lived where a man, he and his wife were druggos and had a baby, they dropped her on her head one night when they were drunk - docs took the kid, a week later they had her, and again she was dropped on her head, the kid was taken again - same thing happened yet again - but they still have the child, and she is now permanatley brain damaged!!!  Useless government departments - today is just another tragedy, and i just hope this maggot gets what he deserves.|`|iCvG9kHqaa	It absolutely sickens me when I hear news like this, I don't watch the news but my hubby who listens to it all day at work tell me when important things come up. I heard of this one, a 16 month old baby who has her back snapped by her father who tried to blame it on a dog attack 24 hours after he had done it, a boy who was in some one's garage locked in a cot and starved and a father who wanted to babysit his child after him and his ex had broken up (disappeared for a few days and the cops found the body in his car and then found him with self inflicted injuries that ended his own life)... It's absolutely horrible!! I can't even smack my daughter if she misbehaves let alone some thing like that. I honestly don't know why people stay in the situations while they are being stressed out by the children which would come to this if they lose it in the end... It's horrible. R.I.P to the little angels to never got to live their lives to the fullest xx|`|772ea204795805197ecc4c86fdfbeb0eaa	Kids are hard work, REALLY hard work. Some people dont grow up before having kids themselves.... and kids can throw up weaknesses in a person's character and play into flaws that some people didnt even know they have.  My father couldnt handle 'stress' well. It made him have a short fuse. Can u imagine what he did to three little girls full of energy? We were dumbed down for years.  Unfortunately you dont need a license or permit or degree to have a child, although I think we should test the mental and emotional capacities of people before they are allowed to let defenceless little human beings get into their care.  Unfit people have been having children for years, and doing horrific things quietly to them inside closed doors. Children cannot understand and cannot protect themselves against goons for parents. Nowadays though, the things they do are really starting to get crazy, or maybe we just started getting used to the other stuff - physical, sexual and mental abuse, abandonment, and a host of other stuff.  I am horrified and saddened to learn of what that little girl went through, that too at the hands of someone she loved and trusted. What a tragedy and a betrayal.... he will have to answer for this someday, not just to a judge, but to a higher power.|`|Or2Iiwoeaa	I agree with you completely.... It's absolutely horrible and I don't see how a parent could do that to their child.....    I live in Montana in the US and we recently had a mother in the town that i live in get arrested and charged with murder. She had brutally murdered her 3 year old autistic son and drove her car around with his body in the trunk for 6 months until she was pulled over for drinking and driving.....    Reading these newspaper articles makes me want to cry then curl up with my son. I feel so sorry for all the babies that mommies an daddies do such terrible things.|`|v57IhvGhaa	I dont have any children, but I do work with children and found this incredibly disturbing.  It made me feel sick in the stomach.  How anybody could feel the need to hurt a child is beyond me, ESPECIALLY when they are you own child, your own flesh and blood!    Im with you all the way on this, something is wrong and we need to fix the problem.  Unfortunately there are alot of cases of child abuse (not always fatal like these, but nonetheless traumatic for those involved) yet there are not enough resources being provided to help those at risk.|`|H0fXySX9aa	it happens all the time try the uk we have parents doing this on a  weekly basis its sick and barbaric and i cant understand how some one can harm a defenseless child   they probably started abusing animals then moved onto kids sick sick sick|`|E8go0osDaa	I know in some cultures it is unlucky to have girls.  But in Australia?  They must have been partially... no, completely retarded!
ii0C0tfXaa	They probably didnt mean it, and they were probably just reacting, Tell them that it upset you, and that you still think about it, and they will probably say sorry and tell u that they didnt mean it lol...Im 18 and my boyfriend is still around too, and sometimes i think about the way people i care about reacted and i kind of get upset with them, and wonder why they would say something so hurtful. I especially get mad when i think about when people said "you made a big mistake" even things like that made me upset, i am almost due now and everyone is excited but sometimes i think about the way they reacted and i want to ask them why the hell they think they deserve to be in mine or my childs life with what they had to say about it!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	When they're in shock people say stupid things they don't really mean.  The fact that they love your son, and I'm assuming want to play the role of granny and grandad, says a lot.  I know you've probably thought these things, but they know they can't take back what they said, and now seeing your son they probably feel so guilty for saying/thinking it.      And I don't believe in the teenage dads running off thing.  Mainly because my sister was just turning 18 when she had her daughter and is still with her partner, whereas I'd just turned 22 when I had my son and split up with my ex when my son was around a month old.  Age doesn't have any bearing on whether or not your in a happy relationshop :)|`|B7nzW4Mcaa	I say F them..  Even tho how shock they were they should have been happy..  U just do what u got to do, prove them wrong by showing them u can take care of ur baby no matter how old u are..|`|kgfeC2Rlaa	Well, as for me... I have read many stories about your problem. I even watched some movies about it. You were right that your parents would be shocked if you were pregnant. I think I would advice you to take care of the baby or take it to adoption when you are financially not stable. But I think you and the dad of the baby should stay together in taking care of him and still stay strong even with all the problems.|`|zhqSxJS9aa	prove them wrong and 19 isn't even that young|`|FwM5hMKgaa	i wouldnt be happy either.   i fell prgnant at 18 and i hadnt even met my partners parents cos they were in a different country, we told them over the phone, and despite the facgt we were young and hadnt met they still didnt react like that.    shock is not an excuse if both react like it!     the main thing you gotta focus on now though is whether they are wanting to be part of their grandchilds life. if they are let go of what their reaction was. if not. have a talk with your partner and see what to do from there...
5mefi2u5aa	It sounds to me that this is something probably unrelated to the food, except for the possibility of an alergy to one of the ingredients.  If you eliminate that then you are most likely dealing with the beginning of a bug.  One of my daughters has a very sensitive gag reflex and would choke and even vomit  her food with the slightest sore throat.      this sounds similar.  -- diet wise I think you are going great  - so relax, as other advice said, stop trying the solids for now and watch for a fever.  (the paracetamol should prevent that for the moment anyhow)    Try to get some sleep, although I never do when one of my kids is sickening.  And see a doctor as soon as humanly possible.    Good Luck, and great job Mum!!|`|pRo92IkGaa	i think he should be seen by a doctor - if he is not having a fever, it may be ok to wait till tomorrow.    is he reaching his normal milestones?|`|ub23m7Praa	I've heard that babies will choke/gag on food if they are used to or only want to be breastfed. So maybe try that then find out how to properly ween your child off the breastfeeding?|`|6db9945ff407961b87dcdc1c2327d1dbaa	Perhaps he's not ready yet to have stage 2 food or you're feeding him too much making him choke on the food?    Oh well, try to see if there are food still left in his mouth and ask you doctor in the morning if it's time for him to feed that or not yet.    Anyhow, the nappy may show that the food you're feeding him isn't getting along with his stomach.      Stop feeding him tonight, see his pediatrician in the morning.  Make sure you got rid of the food left in his mouth though.|`|FlhwA7WMaa	he might now like waht ur feeding him thats quit common and normal    and with putting on solids u will see change in stools.    the things to watch for is bloody stools, dehydration,more then 5 diareha diapers ( straight water like nothing solid) vomiting,rash,fever,nothing wanting to nurse  ,or wanting to sleep unusally..less then 6 wet diapers..    call ur doctor in the morning and ask what they say..    he also very well might be ready for solids. u might need to give him baby cereal . and thicken it to his liken..    just wait till u give sweet patatos it turns the stools different colors!!|`|XDf8xSyyaa	First of all, if you can't take him to the doctor tonight, just don't feed him any solids until you've seen a doctor tomorrow.|`|3rda58OCaa	I think hew ill be fine.  He may not like the food, is full, too much in his mouth, etc.  Just try and relax.  I would just stop feeding him for today and speak with the doctor tomorrow.  This is by no means an emergency!  As they eat new and different things their bowel movements are going to change.  And you are right, he is not near ready to stop breastfeeding.  Since he is breastfeeding you know he isn't going hungry, so you are doing a fine job.  Call his pediatrician in the morning.
Fx77zYhWaa	That's kind of strange.  Usually they tell you to try to slow down on the weight gain as opposed to telling you not to gain anymore weight at all.  25 is a lot but if you started out underweight it's not too bad.|`|VClxXNs3aa	I am 5'7 and started my 1st pregnancy at 142 lb.  I had hyperemesis(severe all-the-time sickness) and lost 10 lb inthe beginning.  I didnt gain back to 142 lb until 20 weeks, and gave birth at 177, so an overall gain of 25 lbs, but if you count the 10 I lost and regained it was 35 lb.    I gained more weight after I had her and by the time she was 7 months I was up to 200.....    yechhhh. now I'm pregnant again(got pregnant when she was 7 months and now she is 10 months and I am 3 months(12 weeks) along, and havent gained any more weight... still at 200.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Wow...  Don't gain anymore?  How does he expect you to manage that?  You have gained too much too soon, but I doubt you are overweight.  I gained 34 pounds with my first. I lost 20 pounds in the first couple of weeks after delivery. And stayed at that weight for 2 years. Then I lost a bit more, met my husband, gained 8 pounds, got pregnant again and gained 65 pounds.   Not something I would recommend.   Eat healthy and walk if you can. Don't stress over your weght.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	My first pregnancy I gained 40 lbs.. then second one I gained under 20 lbs... and this being my third I haven't even gained 10 lbs and I am 7 months along.. As long as your are healthy and not causing you or your baby health problems I think you should be fine!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I'm 40 weeks pregnant and I've gained 17lbs.  Most doctors don't want you gaining more than 30lbs, but every woman is different.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	im 25 weeks and have gained 10.5 pounds..    i dont think that is bad at all considering your height!|`|y1NsA6awaa	With this pregnancy i have gained 38lb. I gained alot more with my first! At 25wks it would be impossible not to gain anymore weight. I wouldnt worry about how much weight you have put on, with the right exercise you can lose it again after. Just obviously dont over do it. Dont constantly watch what you are eating, but try and vary your food too, so you get your fruit and veg and all the right stuff that you need. I really wouldnt worry, just enjoy your pregnancy and the food (within reason), its the only time you can lol!|`|k1l2jhr7aa	I had bad morning sickness the whoel way thru and didnt gain anything.. Everyone is different as long as you know you are eatting healthy and exercising if you are able thats the main thing.. You will be surprised how much you will lose in the first couple of days after the birht with water retention and the baby and placenta etc. Good luck
kaqPSgTVaa	You are an awesome person. I hope more people go and give her some hope or love.|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Wow. There need to be more people like you in this world.

WD6OUUDZaa	i was 19. i am married now, but not to that guy. i really wish i had waited until i was married. people say "no one does that anymore", but i have two friends who did wait, and they are happy they did. one is a guy and one is a girl. they both waited until they found their life partners to give up that precious thing. if i could do it all over again, i'd wait to give myself to my husband.   ugh..13 is way too young. you just can't have the wisdom or maturity at that age. i am a Big Sister with Big Brothers/Big Sisters and my 'Little Sister' is 13 and making out with a bunch of different boys. it's so sad and scary. i hope she won't end up pregnant. she knows ALL about it, but i think she is so desperate to be loved, she will end up being stupid and getting pregnant before she can manage a child.|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	I'm 14 and I would never even consider sex yet. I mean, with all the future that I have ahead of me I can't even imagine how getting pregnant would ruin it.  Yeah, I think about it, but I'd never actually do it. Not until I'm 18 or older, and when I find the right person.|`|jIQKc1dAaa	personally I think some 25 year olds are too young to have sex. Its about maturity and if you really do care about the person you're with.  I had sex for the first time when i was 15. I'd been dating the same boy for a year. Nw almost a year since I had sex I'm still with that boy, we're going on 2 years together. So I think it all depends on the person.|`|VPCVswkpaa	13 is definately too young i waited until i was 18|`|gXzssLJ0aa	I was 17. 13 is WAY to young. I actually had a friend pregnant at 12 once. She's now 18 with a 6 year old daughter. Crazy stuff. Whenever someone she's dating realizes that her daughter is 6 they freak out. Saying they expected it to be 2 or 3 at the most not 6 then they leave. I'm very proud to be almost 20 and childless. I don't need a baby on my hip as an accessory.|`|Nln7UOA9aa	i'm had sex went my old is 15.........................|`|A8Dh3uWhaa	i m now 21 yr old and i had not sex anytime yet ...and i think its good  bcoz sex in small age has bad effect  i have no g frd|`|pfLhYcUVaa	The first night when I was married in '83. I still am married to the same woman.|`|VHHis05Naa	16|`|mxIYhkAnaa	17. I think it depends on the enviroment, my sister had other typical friends, which lead her astray from the straight "clean" path (staying free from addiction) and she lost it on her age of 13... And my other sister had a boyfriend from India, which worshipped her beauty (some people still believe that white skin means wealth and black means poor) and so she gave herself at the age of 15.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I'm surprised as well.  I knew a girl when I was in elementary school who got pregnant at 12.  I think a lot of them troll.  13 is way too young.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I was 16 my first time but very educated. I think the more mature you are and educated you are you won't have as many pregnancy scares and you'll be ok. I do think 13 is too you. 16 can be too young. I know 40 year olds I don't think are mature enough! LOL|`|eu6UQElYaa	I definately think 13 is too young.  I'm sure many of them are trolls looking for attention but sadly, there are 13 year olds in the world having sex.   It's sad really.    Personally, I was 18 almost 19 and had been engaged to him for almost a year before we decided to have sex.  Now we're happily married.  I'm glad I waited until I could handle the responsibility of sex instead of just having sex for the sake of doing it.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	24|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i was 18, but i got married before.. i got married last july and im nine weeks pregnant now, i am graduating college this may with a double major :) my husband owns a company :) so were ready :) but ya a 13 year old having sex is kinda crazy :)|`|6Ik4H01gaa	My mom used to work for wic (women infants & childern) neways people go in & apply for coupons for milk & stuff for children & well she once had an 11 year old come in & apply... its crazy but its happening some or most girls just arent educated on safe sex....|`|bLluZIeTaa	yes i do see what you are saying,its not good but kids are going to do it anyway its not like you can keep them on lock down you just have to put them on birth control and give them condoms,that's just my opinion,good luck|`|taQFWXuHaa	well i was 17 but yea it is shocking how girls so young are having sex. Well, I know I wasn't that old when i first started but dayum these are seriously kids....but that is their life and whether we like it or not there are gonna be a countless number of girls talking about how they just had sex at the age of 12 or something....|`|Coc593Ikaa	I was 18 and completely responsible about it. The boy turned into the man that I married years later. We managed to not get pregnant for over a decade. Then it only took a few months when we decided to give it a go!    Sadly, I think some of those questions are from real girls in real trouble. But at least half of them are trolls trying to get attention. Of course 13 is too young. When I was 13 I was a complete fool. I was a smart girl, but I was still developing into the person I became. I had so much work to do to figure myself out that I could never have given a child what it needed. Unfortunately, girls who are at that age can't clearly see that...and they won't for many years to come. For now, they think the rest of us are old and outdated.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	13 is definitely too young.
5UCgp2hnaa	Well I have never seen One Tree Hill, and I'm not so sure that that is the reason. I don't know anybody with a child that watches that show (it's more for younger teenagers). But I know a couple of Lucas's that are around 14-17 and I live in Los Angeles. Maybe it's a coincidence that you hadn't heard it? I'm not sure.  I personally LOVE the name though.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I know a few Lucas's. I am 20 years old. It's kind of common here...

ncpl2ruzaa	Maybe start taking away the sweets and junk food and only offer her healthy foods. She WILL EAT if shes hungry, so try not to worry to much, trust me she wont starve herself. Maybe instead of junk foods and sweets offer bananas and apples. And tell her she can have a apple when she eats ..... or she can have a cookie after you eat ....., just stop giving her sweets instead of meals and you need to tell her grandmother to stop this as well. Its only going to hurt your child in the end so please dont hesitate to correct the way her grandmother is feeding her. And be consistant dont give in and give her the junk food unless she eats the healthier food. Good luck sweetie i know this cant be easy.|`|FegAXbgiaa	Here are some sites that i hope will help in some way.    I am very lucky that my daughter will eat anything apart from chips, from an early age sweet things were given after she had eaten her food, i learnt that from experience : )    http://www.familiesonlinemagazine.com/Ch...    http://www.askamum.co.uk/Toddler/Left-ha...    http://www.babyworld.co.uk/information/b...    Edit grandparents mean well she was prorbably worried she wasnt eating.|`|sA3ae7eQaa	try making up stories with the food, like the train is going into the tunnel(her mouth) it makes it fun for them, also try getting her to help you make the food and she may wont to eat some after.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I got given a great tip the other day - write a story together - for example, something with a rabbit in a vegetable garden. Use a soft toy rabbit and when you read the story, have her make the bunny hop every time the story says 'bunny hop' and have her eat a bit of carrot every time the bunny does, or whatever other vegetable you're serving. You could do any kind of story with any kind of food, and I tried it last night with my 3 year old and it really worked!  Also, I let her name her food - she loves soup but is picky. She won't eat 'sweet potato and carrot soup', but she'll eat 'orange soup' (same thing, lol). She had 'leeky' soup yesterday which was leek and potato. Let her believe certain things about her food - soup gives her a big smile, and sausages give her long hair and big elbows(I swear she made that one herself, and she seems to want big elbows!). Don't make such a big deal of getting her to eat, but make a big deal when she has eaten any. I also refuse any snacks between meals if she hasn't eaten her last meal (don't eat lunch - nothing till dinner), and if she does get a snack, she can only have fresh fruit. Some children are funny about the way things are cooked - mine will only eat carrots raw. As the nutritional value is higher raw, I am totally ok with that.  ADD - If you look at my recent questions, I asked a similar thing and got some fab tips.|`|sk46uigvaa	Don't give into her, most children would refer to eat biscuits etc but tell her that she naughty for refusing her dinner.    I know 3 adults who wont eat normal meals because their parents gave in!    Try and think of some fun recipes, make sure their colourful and interesting.    If your daughter refuses to eat eat, take her to a 'naughty corner and make her stay there till she's willing to eat.    Don't worry she WILL eat!    good luck    EDIT I KNOW HOW ANNOYING IT IS WHEN A RELATIVE GIVES YOUR CHILD SWEETS AND SETS OFF A BAD HABIT!    KEEP A FOOD DIARY AND GET EVERYONE TO MAKE A NOTE OF WHAT SHE'S EATEN, AT THE END OF THE DAY REWARD HER WITH A STAR WHE SHE'S DONE WELL.|`|y39iNwFjaa	try making 'homemade' crisps as these will be more nutriotious and make your own chicken nuggets by covering chicken breast bits in egg and then breadcrumbs before baking them in the oven. Do not buy 'packet sweets or crisps' she will learn to eat but reward when she does eat and ignore when she doesn't. Don't make a naughty step issue out of it or her problems may become deep-rooted. Let her help you make food. Give her  achildren's recipe book and get her to choose what you'll both make. The story tip sounds good too! Make food fun!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	So don't buy junk food. None at all. Don't have it in the house. If all that's available is healthy food, she'll eat when she's hungry.|`|KUZrSrrBaa	My sister has the same exact problem. YOU should have not gave her candy, now she's hooked on it, my niece refuses as well and it's her dads fault for feeding it to her (she doesn't want nothing but candy now). You need to completely block off candy from the menu, she'll get hungry and beg for something to eat. Don't give children candy, wait until they reach a certain age.|`|AA11795652	My daughter just turned 4 but I used to (and sometimes still do) cut up fruits, veggies, crackers, cheese, and meats in funny shapes or lay them out on her plate to make a picture.  Her favorite is using meat and cheese to make a whale in the ocean with a sun and some birds up above it.  The best method is to give her food that she can eat with her fingers and dip into a sauce like ranch, ketchup, or peanut butter, of course, depending on the food.  Another thing, if she saw me enjoying the food, then she wanted it.  When she said she didn't want to eat, sometimes I would just make myself a plate and then she would want my food and eat all of my food.  Then I would just go make another plate for myself.  One more method is to give foods funny names.  I once took a simple sandwich and cut it up in five even long pieces and called them "fingers."  She loved the thought of eating fingers and I would gasp or say ow every time she took a bite and she would giggle and keep chomping away.  Hope this helps.  Oops, thought of one more thing, let her help you make the food, even if she's just watching you in the kitchen on a stool and you let her move the food from the cutting board to a plate.  Oh, one more, make sure she has her own special plate or bowl like with her favorite character on it.  That always makes meals more special.  Okay, I think I'm finally done.  Nope, one more, tell the grandmas and nanas to help you out by not giving her sweets until she's eaten a real meal first.  Okay, that's it.  Good luck!|`|dua2M0O7aa	ok kids that age will go through that stage my sister eat skips crisps for 6months,my daughter only had tinned beans and sausage for 4months.  try not to worry some food is better than NO food  don't buy sweets and crisps for a bit and make more food for you and try to get her to have off your plate as you have tried the other ways (shapes)  if she goes to school/drop in Centre have her friend over for food and give them what the kid likes your daughter will eat the same .  buy a star chart and praise her each time she eats her food and then on the weekend give her her treats   dont give up stand firm its hard but it will be worth it !!|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Just yesterday someone posted a very similar question on another site.  It's very, very, common for three-year-olds to have minimal interest in food.    Here's the answer I wrote to that other person (but, again, this question comes up over and over again, usually related to three-year-olds):    Little kids (at least the ones who aren't "chow hounds") usually don't like the same kind of foods that adults like. They like simple, easy-to-eat, foods. They get "turned off" by seeing too much on their plate (actually, I do, even now).    Although they were always healthy little kids, it sometimes seemed to me that my kids didn't eat at all. They did, of course, but two bites of dinner can look like "not eating at all".    What I did was make sure that the only food in the house was nutritious food, which meant that every last little snack they ate offered nutrition. I made sure there was white and strawberry milk, lots of different fruit and vegetable juices, fresh fruit, little fruit cups, yogurts, and lots of different cheeses. There were always raw, baby, carrots they could eat (and I made a tomato dip sometimes). I kept little, single-serve, tuna and packages of chicken chunks. I bought the best (no sugar added) cereal and let them snack on dry cereal (or cereal with milk). I did keep wheat bread, wheat crackers, and some cheese crackers - all of which could have peanut butter or cheese added.    Little kids often like scrambled eggs (protein), so I took advantage of that.    Some little kids would rather have canned, diced, vegetables. They're softer. Carrots, peas, Lima beans, and mixed vegetables tend to be vegetables little kids like more than, say, green beans. If you do something like put a few carrots, a few Lima beans, and a couple of cherry tomatoes on her plate - that's three vegetables right there; and it doesn't take much effort. If she has something like a glass of milk and a couple of bites of protein, that would be an ok dinner for young child. If she's more likely to eat something like chicken plain, maybe hold out a couple of pieces before doing something like adding sauce or putting it in a casserole. Again, not much effort to do. You could then offer some of whatever else you're having. She'll either want some or not.    For dinners, I'd make sure I had whichever vegetables I knew they would eat. Sometimes they'd eat some of whatever we were having for dinner - just not much, usually. Once in a while, there would be a meal they really liked and really seemed to enjoy. On the other hand, I didn't worry a whole lot if they did something like only eat a little dinner. Although we (their father, the children, and I) would all sit down to begin dinner together; if they ate what they wanted and then wanted to leave the table we didn't expect them to stay longer when they were little.    At three and a half (especially if you work, and she's somewhere else during the day), your daughter is probably tired and a little frazzled from her day too. It may be a little too much for her to sit for too long at the table. If you're expecting her to eat what she doesn't want to eat, that will just be more stress.    If she is expected to sit only for as long as she wants, and if she's given foods she likes; maybe you could also do something like have her do something "quiet" if she gets down from the table. Tell "It's dinner time, and that's a quiet time - so if you want to go look at books or color while we finish having dinner, that's fine." That gives her the option of not being expected to stay at the table when she's bored and unhappy, while also helping her recognize that "dinner time" is a separate, "special", time. Most people don't want kids running around wild during dinner time, and it is never a bad thing to help a child know how to use some self-control (while still having some freedom of choice).    Besides, whatever she does now is not the same as what she'll be doing next year or the year after. Children go through stages and change.|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	ha ha sorry for laughing but i was saying that only a month ago my daughter was stocking up on biscuits and Chocolate and crisps and wasn't hungry by the time me and her daddy sat down to eat. and the true of the matter is they no you can't make them eat. i banned all biscuits, crisps and sat her down telling her it was time to eat, i'd turn tele of and put toys away and then plate her food up. put it in front of her and leave her to eat it whilst i eat mine if she didn't it it went in the bin and she would go with out until the next meal time and so on now she eats what i put in front of her every meal time and if she doesn't she still waits until the next meal time. your child will learn that not eating there dinner will leave them feeling hunger, they aren't going to die from missing a couple of meals try it it worked with my little girl|`|s9haCi64aa	Do not give her junk explain to her she needs to eat her meals before she is allowed treats.

sAqfeSapaa	Did you take pregnancy pills?  If yes, some pills affect your hormones.    Pills work this way.    It produces hormones tricking your body that you are pregnant.  So during this stage no egg is produced hence you will miss your cycle.     There are different types of pregnancy pills.  That is why it is strongly advised to visit your OB first before taking pills, this is to help find the suitable pill for you.    So in your case, I can probably assume that you took pregnancy pills and caused it.  Stop taking the pills and you should become normal again.  But if you want to be triple sure, visit your OB.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would see a doctor. That's not common. It could be pregnancy but unlikely if you've taken tests. It could also be something medical. Severe stress can also cause missed periods. Talk to a doctor and get an exam done.|`|z06mMAieaa	Pregnancy,Medical conditions, Stress, hormones,  Many many things.

So yes, it is possible that you can have one and be fine afterward.    One of my friends lost 2 pregnancies before her 3rd which she carried to term and he's in high school right now. For her, the OB was able to identify her problem, treat her medically and she had a successful pregnancy.     One loss is not a pattern. Don't worry yourself. And lastly, I am so very sorry for your loss.|`|W8pBw6bZaa	my mum had a m/c but then had me.|`|VHHis05Naa	Yes!  I miscarried Dec. 04 and went on to get pregnant Feb. 05.

I honestly believe that a lot of women have trouble their first pregnancy and I offer my condolences for yours. I too suffered a miscarriage my first pregnancy and am now pregnant a year later and its going great.

Got pregnant one month later. So I'm 25 weeks pregnant. I had problems with my current. I had bleeding problems with cramps due to low lying placenta. So had to go on bed rest for a month. After that had brown discharge still till about 14 weeks. Now I on bed rest again as I'm having early contractions. Main reason is due to my womb is low lying.    Main thing before trying to get pregnant again is to get your womb strong again. Take good care of your health. Also, when you are pregnant again let your doctor know about your previous m/c. They will put your under high risk pregnancy. For my case, my work require a lot of standing so when i had cramps for my 1st pregnancy I ignore it as there is no bleeding and ended in miscarriage. So I learned the hard way. Don't ignore any discomfort and cramps.     All the best to you. You can view my pregnancy blog at:  http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	my first pregnancy was a missed miscarriage. we had seen a healthy heart beat at 8 weeks and 6 days later the baby died. we didnt find out until a routine scan at 12 weeks. the hospital booked me in for a d&c a few days later. i had the baby tested and it died because the placenta didnt attach properly.  it was really hard and i didnt think i was meant to have a baby.and i was so scared that if i got pregnant again i would lose it again.  two months later i did get pregnant again and when i was 5 weeks pregnant i started to bleed and i thought i miscarriaged again. it was to early to see anything on an ultrasound so i had to wait for two weeks before i found out if i lost the baby or not. two weeks later my scan showed a healthy baby. but i was still woriied because i had seen a heart beat the first time and still lost the baby. i bled at 7 weeks,9 weeks and 11 weeks each time i had severe cramping aswell. but every ultrasound showed a healthy baby.  i brought a doppler so that i could hear the heart beat whenever  i wanted. but i still worried that something would go wrong.  i am now 25 weeks and everythings still good, but there hasnt been one day that i havent worried that something might go wrong,even when i feel her moving i still worry.  i think it's totally normal to be scared after you lose a baby,but im glad i am pregnant again and that everything good so far.   good luck|`|SxXIUBERaa	My mom had a miscarriage.  First she had my older sister, then the miscarriage, then me, then my little brother.      A miscarriage can be difficult and traumatic, but don't let it deter you if you are intent on starting a family.  Many women go on to have healthy happy families after miscarrying, and they are not uncommon.  Sometimes pregnancies just don't work out for a variety of biological reasons, I'm sure it's nothing you did, and I hope you don't have to go through it again.    Good luck.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	I had one pregnancy and baby before I had a m/c....it was when my first born was 22 months old. I was 7 weeks, it hurt a lot and I still sit and wonder what if. Well that was early october 07 I fell pregnant again in August 08 and am currently 26 weeks 3 days with that baby :D So there is hope and there is light at the end of the tunnel.     (My best friend also had a m/c between her 1st and 2nd child and then went on to have her third without a m/c in between)
JxVx0GXiaa	anything's possible but from your description of events i highly doubt you are pregnant. you can take an ultra sensitive test up to 7 days before your period is due - just take one to put your mind at ease. you're probably not pregnant though.|`|9iOHAC41aa	It's possible. Your just going to have to wait to find out though. Sorry i can't be of much help.    But i hope it turns out however you want it to.
3EhoJ42zaa	I would definately call the doctor about it in the morning.  Could be a yeast infection, is there any irritation?  Yeast infections can be very common in pregnancies.  Either way call so you can get the proper antibiotics or OTC treatment.    I wouldn't go rushing in to the doctor, just call them.  They'll either call in a prescription for you or tell you what to take OTC.  I got my very first yeast infection with my second pregnancy and they only had me take Monistat 7 days so they'll probably do the same for you.  I would just call first and see if they need you to go in to be checked.  It just sounds like a simple yeast infection though.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would call your doctor i n the morning. It is definitely an infection but he's the one to have the diagnoses not us. Definetly a type of infection though.
Y4o65HEoaa	Hey Amy, well as you know. I have 5 kids. They are all pretty close in age, so we did the same things you did. But, some of the stuff they grew out of. I donated to my local church. They took tons of my old stuff, & they really appreciated it! We also have some charities we donated the things too.    Hope the helps!|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	The first crib I bought was for my first, Bailee. By the time I was pregnant with Jayden, Bailee was 5 already and not using her crib. I decided to reuse it. After I found out I was having Sophie, the crib was still being used by Jayden. I wanted to purchase a new crib rather than rush Jayden into a 'big girl bed'. When Jayden finished with that crib, it was brought to a place for pregnant women who don't think they can afford to keep their baby. Think about bringing them to one of these places, because for most of the women that try to get help their, it's either that or abortion.    Then I got pregnant again, which was unexpected. Since we'd just gotten rid of Bailee and Jayden's old crib, and Sophie was still using hers, we had to get, yet another one, for Alexis.     Sophies crib was brought to the same store, but we decided to keep Alexis' crib just in case we were able to adopt a baby in the future. Luckily, we were and had the perfect crib for Grace, which was Alexis' old one.     Sorry for the rambling! I think being home all week with the kids got to my brain or something.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Wow...I think you have your hands full. If your kids go to their grandparents a lot, that would be a good idea (and helpful to the grandparents) to take some of the things over there, and hopefully keep them occupied for a while. If you have friends that need some stuff and want it, that's a good idea.  Store or sell the rest or if you don't need the money, donate it to a charity so it will go to people that can't afford a lot of things for their kids.    Hang in there!|`|EMKuBql8aa	Give them away to your church/religious worshiping place. they are always in need of baby items to give to needy families. That way you know it is going to someone who needs it.|`|ZnHTfNycaa	There are so many struggling parents and single moms who would enjoy the items you have immensely!  A good website to look for people who could use baby stuff would be: http://www.wishuponahero.com  Good luck!|`|AA11742696	Yes I agree...it would be good to donate them to a church,or a women's shelter,or one of the thrift stores..it is good karma
BTuFtui3aa	Obviously most babies are raised by their biological parents. For those who are not, what you're asking is a little complicated.     Almost all newborns who are voluntarily surrendered by their mothers for private/agency adoption are adopted immediately. It is estimated that there are 40 waiting families per every 1 newborn available, so healthy babies won't struggle to find homes. The only babies who are in any real danger of not finding homes when relinquished to private adoption are those with severe special needs, and even these children find homes more often than not. Infants are very wanted.    There are infants and toddlers in foster care, but typically they aren't available for adoption. Usually the mother and father are following a case plan to try to get them back. It would be rare for an infant in foster care to have already had the biological parents' rights terminated. The biological parents don't have custody at the time, but they're usually still working to get it back when the child is that young. Termination of parental rights in foster care takes time, and until it happens, the child isn't available for adoption. Once the child becomes available to be adopted, infants and toddlers in foster care are usually snapped up fast, because a lot of families want them.    There are over 100,000 children in US foster care who are legally free for adoption and awaiting permanent homes-- but very very few of them are infants or toddlers. Most are older children or part of a sibling group that includes older children too.    Infants who are legally free to be adopted are rarely left without homes barring severe special needs or medical problems, because lots and lots of families want infants.|`|2f49jsLpaa	Yes, there are far more families waiting to adopt an infant in the US then there are babies available for adoption, and despite what another poster stated, minority children do not go into fostercare because no one wants to adopt them. There are actually many families who been waiting a while to adopt and are open to a child of ANY race. Unless the child has severe special needs, if an infant is placed for adoption i the US, there will be no problem finding adoptive parents.|`|YHlrsRfSaa	No. Some americans keep their babies and raise them.|`|9xraO8Znaa	No, over 90% are not adopted.|`|dMVO7z7vaa	what do you mean?  this kinda sounds rasist  (offence intended!)|`|rD03JBxmaa	Most newborns in American who are not raised by their birthmothers are adopted as newborns, because their birthmothers have chosen to find adoptive families for them.   Usually children in foster care have been taken away from birthparents by social services.|`|0sJsTN83aa	US babies are in high demand, while older children stay in orphanages a lot longer (sometimes they are never adopted).  However, babies who are considered "defective" by society are often not adopted.  These babies may have AIDS, physical deformities, or other health/cosmetic concerns.      In general though, most American infants are scooped up without hesitation.|`|vwTyihvvaa	No, some biological parents keep them and raise them, some are in foster care and only a small percentage are adopted each year.|`|loy04C98aa	If the biological mother knows that she wants to give up her baby for adoption during the pregnancy, than yes.    The problem is all the unwanted infants and children who are either abandoned or removed from their biological parent(s).  These are the children who land in the foster system.  It takes years for the courts to severe the ties and make these children available for adoption.    Adding to the problem is many of the children are from sibling groups, born drug addicted or with disabilities. Then finally add to this problem that many of these children aren't the blond haired, blue eyed cherubs that most families are seeking to adopt.  So no, most American children who desperately need loving homes are not adopted.|`|Wnmg850Paa	To many to count end up in foster care. Usually it takes a number of years to get a baby ready for adoption because of all the red tape, so they really aren't babies by the time they are adopted. But if a mother knows she wants to place her baby up for adoption she can go through the right channel and have her infant place with an adopted family right away.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	A majority of white American babies are able to find homes with infertile couples or couples who believe they are doing a good deed.    The majority of mixed race or ethnic babies go into foster care since they are less desirable to these couples who are looking for a perfect family.     I don't like the way it is, but that's how the system has become in the United States.

3EhoJ42zaa	It started off easy until I hit 28 weeks and then all of a sudden gained 12 lbs in two weeks and then at the same time my blood pressure slowly started going up.  By 30 weeks my blood pressure was 150's/90's and Iw as put on strict bedrest.  At 32 weeks I was put in the hospital because it shot up to 155/112.  I was there for two days trying to get my blood pressure down andi f it didn't go down I would have been induced.  It did go down and Ihad to be on full bedrest, only allowed to get up an hour a day and see the doctor once a week and get nonstress tests twice a week with two biophysical ultrasounds a week until delivery.  At 38 weeks my blood pressure was just too high, there was protien in my urine so I was induced.      That was my first pregnancy.  My second has been the perfect text book pregnancy.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	My pregnancy was difficult.  I was sick almost the whole time.  I had a month and a half break of sickness in the middle.  It was through the summer months so I was even more hot than usual.  I had lower back pain that was constant from 3 months until I gave birth.  I was still in college and by the fifth month I couldn't even fit in some of the desks(embarrassing).  I wouldn't have traded the experience for anything(except I wouldn't have minded have a shorter labor)    The good things were that my hair looked so smooth and my skin was always clear and looking great.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	Difficult, sick from day one to the very end. My body did not take well to pregnancy, my heart, blood pressure and thyroid got affected. I got hyperemesis. My baby was 5lbs at birth. It was horrible i couldn't eat anything for 4 months and then 1 month i survived on just liquids then the next month on sunkist soda and a snikers a day. then a few bites of actual food...then thankfully 2 months before giving birth i was able to have a whole meal. but i would have to time it correctly so i wouldn't throw it back up. so i would be in bed a lot sleeping off the sickness. i ended up in the hospital a few times because all my problems and got a magic medication called zofran and that's when i could eat...the medicine only worked the day and maybe the next day after getting through IV... I used to weigh 120lbs pre pregnancy i dropped to 98lbs and by the time i gave birth i was 116lbs. mid way through it doctors discovered my baby wasn't growing properly so i had to see lots more high risk doctors than i was already seeing. I got like 13 ultrasounds and a bunch of non stress test and i got to see a perinatologist so he could check out the baby and everything inside my womb to check everything was working properly... but labor and delivery were awesome i didn't feel a thing. Now i have a wonderful 6 month old baby girl!!|`|gx4s68s8aa	Honestly?  Pretty bad.  I mean others have it worse, but most don't.    I had 9 months of morning sickness- so lots of nausea and lots of vomiting all nine months.  It was really hard for me to gain weight.  Only gained 20 pounds and doctor wanted me to gain at least 30.    DVT in the 26 week.  So I was in the hospital for 6 days on complete bed-rest.  Thankfully, I got to the hospital in time and both myself and my baby were fine.  But for about a 12-18 hours it was really unsure if we would both make it.    Then lots of extra doctors appointments after that- for tons of blood work etc.  And twice daily blood thinner injections.    And it ended with a induction that didn't work and I had to have a c-section.    Despite that it was worth it.  And thus the reason I am pregnant again.|`|ZS5FI34waa	yup|`|BETCfjFdaa	OMG, it was Terrible! However, that is probably because I am a guy. LOL.|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	I had morning sickness all the time, but it was only nausea. I only threw up once or twice. I also got bronchitis for 2 weeks during my 6th months. Overall, I'd say it wasn't too difficult. However, I did not like getting bigger and bigger... and labor was very hard, but only 12 hours.|`|e9204803d0daf4a1a00f19ce852f5d74aa	morning sickness til 16 weeks  massive weight gain  Hypertension at 32 weeks  Preeclampsia at 35 weeks  Induction at 36 weeks due to preeclampsia  BUT....

bLluZIeTaa	yes getting off of the pill can really mess your cycles up for a while And make your Body do some pretty weird things i mean its messing with your hormones of course you are going to have some chances,and as for the neck aces and really don't know about that maybe you have been sleeping wrong that's the only thing that i can really think of,good luck|`|3GZz5iNFaa	after all that time, you should probably have a chk up.  But is normal for your body to take time to adjust, and everyone is different.  It might take a few months, drink lots of water and eat right and think twice before you take it again.
kaqPSgTVaa	Call your doctor in the morning or call a 24 hour pharmacy, like Walgreen's and ask to speak to the pharmacist to be sure. :)
rmse6Mj8aa	Ignore the answer above me, the word "thrush" doesnt seem to mean anything to some people they get it confused with something else.    I just went through this. I did not conceive this cycle but I did get a nasty yeast infection.  I looked into this quite a lot and basically the creams and pessaries (vaginal capsules) are called topical treatments and are fine to use when pregnant or ttc. Topical basically means you only treat the affected area.  The oral tablet that you take with water and works much better and much faster you absolutely can not take while pregnant or ttc. however, I would recommend that you get your partner to take the over the counter oral capsule as he could pass this back to you once you are all better and who wants that? men can have thrush in their penis and not even really display many symptoms so it is worth getting the medication down them asap.    There is no harm in treating your thrush with the canesten cream and pessary.  You should notice some relief within the next 2 days. I also recommend wearing things made from breatheable fabrics like cotton underwear.  There is one thing I also discovered: you can be much more vulnerable to yeast infections when ttc because of all the sperm and fluid down there, but when pregnant you are also more likely to have yeast infections as well.  I hope this helps you and you can relax and get through your two week wait without any additional stress.    Good luck and baby dust. x|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	No I haven't experienced that....but you would NOT want a vaginal insert for thrush!!!  Thrush is yeast infection in the mouth.  If it's in your vagina it's a vaginal yeast infection.  Make sure you get the right administration for the med!

UUpsa35Daa	One of my close friends just found out she was pregnant about a month ago and she was scared and nervous and excited and worried all at the same time. I started doing some research for her to calm her down...looking for some websites for her to take a look at and making a list of baby supplies people recommend (which is getting quite long) etc but after going through some of it and having it all laid out if front of her, she's really starting to calm down, as is her fiance.

c6DHQIZsaa	My twins were born at 35 weeks, weighing 4lbs11 and 6lb12 and were absolutely fine.  My girl (the smaller of the two) spent the first 12 hours in an incubator at my side just to regulate her temperature but she could come out for cuddles and feeds so it was basically just a hot cot for her! My son needed nothing at all!  The hospital did manage to keep my labour going for 24 hours to get steroids into me, which developed my babies lungs so they had no need for special care but I was very lucky to have been able to get those into me in time because with twins I went straight to hospital at the first possible twinge and they knew I was likely to have gone into early labour anyway so were prepared for us.  My consultant did say that if i made it to 36 weeks I wouldn't have needed the steroids so I am guessing if you are approaching 36 weeks then you wouldn't either.    At 35-36 weeks the chances of survival are enormous and the chances of him having problems are quite low.    If he arrived now he would have a good chance of all signs of prematurity to have disappeared to be well before he was one.  With mine i found they were developmentally just about right rather than 5 weeks behind and they have put weight on brilliantly.    The pains you are feeling are likely to just be your body getting ready for the big day or him engaging his head so not necessarily a sign that he is about to make his big appearance but if you want any reassurance just give your midwife a call.    Good luck and I hope all goes well for you and you meet your little man soon but not too soon!|`|eu6UQElYaa	It may be a little small and may need to spend some time in the NICU (depending on it's size, lung development, and ability to eat from a bottle) but that all depends on the baby.     A friend of mine just gave birth a couple of weeks ago (she was 6 weeks early so it was at 35 weeks) and her daughter was fine but small and needed to be in the NICU for about a week until she was strong enough to go home and was reliably taking a bottle.  My cousin's son was born 6 weeks early and he never had to be in the NICU, was big, strong, eating well, breathing well and was able to go home in the usual couple of days.     So yeah, alot of it depends on the individual baby but with medical technology the way it is, survival chances at that point are really very good.    And the sharp vaginal pain is probably a muscle spasm.  They tend to happen the further along you go.  Just more of your body's way of preparing for the eventual onset of labor and delivery.|`|9iOHAC41aa	I don't think it would make much of a difference. I was born at 35 weeks and i turned out just fine. The only problem i had was breathing, but my mom smoked during her whole pregnancy with me so i don't think it had much to do with my being born early.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	A baby born after 34 weeks is generally ok.  My baby was born at just about 34 and a half weeks.  He was small, and he had to be tube fed (to save calories); but he was fine.   Every week is they stay makes things that much better for them.    Toward the end of pregnancy you can get all kinds of weird pains from things like muscle pulls, pressure on nerves, and whatever else.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	my daughter was born at 36 weeks and weighed 6lb9oz    I was told that be prepared for her to be in neonatal however, she didn't need to go!|`|H0fXySX9aa	probably yes  i was always told there could be a problem with the lungs not being mature enough  my friend had her baby at 38 weeks and he needed special care because of hi9s lungs not being developed properly  the shooting pain is probably the baby on a nerve i had that
r7q8LW7Aaa	Thats unusual for your midwife to be doing a membrane sweep - have you had complications? In the UK, they usually won't do a membrane sweep until you are at least a week past your due date. And a scan? I'v never heard of a scan for being past your date.  Anyway, I was induced twice - both at 42 weeks. Both times I was given two doses of the prostins pessary and went into labour within a few hours. They were both quick labours and had no complications. usually they try the psotins first, then if they don't work, they'll either put you on a pitocin drip to start contractions or break your waters.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I was scheduled for an induction july 11th bc I was already 7 days over. Then on July 10th I began to have contractions and they became every 5 min and unbearable so I went to labor and delivery hoping to just get some pain meds to help me survive the night til my induction enxt day. well it turns out id suddenly developed pre-eclampsia with a bp reading of 160/110, they said if I went home I could have a seizure so they gave me mag sulfate for my blood pressure and pitocin to induce me. I went in only 1 cm dialted (but the day before had not been dialted AT ALL so those natural contractions did do something at least) and almost 100 percent effaced (compared to only 20 percent at my appointment the day before). I went from 1cm dialated to 9 cm in 4 hrs, and then pushed for 2 hrs. when I got to 9 cm they gave me an epdiral and it worked wonders, didnt feel a single contraction.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I had an induction at 39+3 days.  It went well for me.  On the Monday I had a hospital appt as I was developing PE, as I had + protein and was it was almost my due date I was given a membrane sweep on the Monday and given an appt for the Wed morning to be induced.     Wed: Induction started at 2pm, fully dilated by 6pm.  Started pushing at 7pm, baby born at 7.45pm.    My experience was really good in that the induction took very well.  I've heard other stories of labour not starting or progressing and ending up in c-section.  Which must be gutting.  Also, my colleague who was due a month ahead of me went 10 days overdue, then on the morning of her scheduled induction went into labour!  So you still have plenty of time to go!    As for someone asking about why you had a membrane sweep, in my area of the UK (N Lanarkshire - Scotland) we routinely get a sweep at 40 weeks if we want one.  I don't know if that's just down to outr midwives though.  Just thought I'd add that in, lol.    Good luck with it all!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I was induced at 41 weeks - i had two membrane sweeps before i went in, and when i got there i was 3cm dilated.  Do LOTS of walking, squats and more walking.  I am glad i got induced, i had a relatively quick labour - but i lost 650ml blood and had 30 stitches because i tore.  But if you have already had a child, chances are you will go yourself naturally.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Dont worry your baby will come when hes ready, hes probably so comfy in there so doesnt want to come just yet. If you hve to be induced its not too bad, i was induced as i had preclamsia. They put this gel up you and within a few hours you will go into labour. To get labour starting eat spicy foods, go for long walks, try rasberry tea, there are a few things to fasten labour|`|wTeJulT5aa	I went to the hospital with contractions on my due date.  I was 3 cm.  They admitted me, and then the contractions started getting further apart, so they gave me pitocin.  I had my baby 6 hours after they started the pitocin drip.  Everything went well, and I'm happy they induced me instead of sending me home.|`|xtieIDTyaa	Yep! Chances are you will go yourself, I was late and was due to be induced 2 days after i went myself, I hope all goes well for you.    CONGRATS ON THE NEW ARRIVAL!! (Early congrats) Hehe|`|AA11795652	I was induced with  2 because he was breech at 32 weeks, moved head down, then moved back up, and once he moved back down at 39 weeks, my doctor induced me before he could move back up again.  Well, at the hospital before they gave me my IV to induce me, they hooked me up to the monitors and I was already having some contractions on my own but they were too light for me to really feel them.  I think I helped my body get ready by walking like crazy.  My body was sore from walking so much but it did help.  If you walk enough, you could help your labor come about.  Get the epidural if you are induced because the contractions come on so fast and so hard it takes your breath away.  Congrats and good luck!|`|AA10091300	I was induced 2 weeks before delivery of my youngest son..all it did was make me sleepy and groggy.  You will probably stay true to your first pregnancy and go a week over..relax! Baby will be here in his own time|`|BQYXgtq7aa	Hi. I understand your stress and concern but try not to let it consume you. Babies when come when they are good and ready.  I was induced (attempt at it anyway) at 37 weeks as I had pre eclampsia (a high blood pressure related pregnancy illness), The first inducement of 2 lots of gels failed. i was sent to a capital city childrens and womens hospital where nearly a week later they tried inducing me again. Luckily the 2nd lot of gels at the 2nd hospital worked for me. I was able to dilate to one cm where they broke my waters and sent me into labour. My experience was real good however, as after being in labour for 8 days and advanced labour for at least 8 hours, my son turned his head in the birth canal and got stuck. i ended up having a simpsons forceps delivery. My baby is happy healthy and came out none the wiserof his delivery and the hard time he gave his mummy!    Take it easy, rest up and spend time with your son you already have! Enjoy the peace :)    Good Luck|`|AA12279950	There's nothing to fear with induction.  It just gets you to the harder stages of labour much faster, so you don't have the slow building of contractions.  It's certainly no more painful so don't be worried about it.|`|JxVx0GXiaa	my baby was posterior so doc decided to induce the day before my due date. gel was inserted to soften the cervix at 4pm, with an intention to induce me by drip the following morning.  i started with contractions at 11pm and my waters broke at 3am, so i went into labour without being fully induced. i gave birth at 11.45 am that day.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	i was told id be induced, and ended up going into labour naturally the day before.    But then during my nice natural starting labour, my blood pressure got too high, so they put me on pitocin anyways!!    Dont worry, its not as bad as everyone will have you believe!!!    I would walk and walk and walk...     OR you can try my mothers remedy - "hot curry, hot bath, hot sex."    hmmm! Good luck!!|`|MHNFnBzgaa	hey  was induced at 38 weeks and 5 days pregnant, given 1st lot of gel at 4pm on thursday 24th july 08 but that ever worked to given 2nd lot at 9pm and 3 hours later the contractions started, by 3am i was 3 cm's and was taken down to the labour ward and was given gas and air but that never worked so given Pethidine at 5am which took the edge of the pain and then at 7am was given the Epidural which was amazing,   was pushing for an hour and a half and then they realised he was facing to the side and i had to go down to Theatre So They could Use Forceps and he was born at 11am on Friday the 25th july 08,weightingg 7 pounds 5oz, so i was in labour for 8 hours|`|djtjQixuaa	I was pregnant with my first child and was induced but I wasn't overdue-they did it 5 wks before my due date but it was no big deal. Like I said it was my first pregnancy and when they gave the medicine it only took three hours for my little boy to arrive- no complications. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Unfortunately, there is no way to know if it will happen on its own or if you will need a little help but the important thing is to have a happy healthy baby and if he stays in there too long the condtion of your uterus detirorates. Best of luck!|`|fXWxSJ5yaa	Due to gestational diabetes I was admitted to be induced on my due date, 10th Nov.     After 6 doses of the hormone they give ( I cannot remeber what it is called) and a few consultants in my bits up to their elbows I was scheduled for a (planned) emergency c-section. I was so scared and fought them all the way.    It was, however, the best thing I could have done. My little boy was born at lunchtime on the 16th at 9lb3. He was huge. The birth was very relaxed and the aftercare was comprehensive.    Induction is nothing to fear. You child will come out one way or the other.     Just understand that induction does not always work, I wish some one had told me that.|`|AA11011628	i was induced on my 2 babies. dont worry it is just fne. they will put something on your vagina and after an hour u will start labor.|`|9iDhKZ1Oaa	I was induced at 39 weeks exactly because of high blood pressure...  i went in around 6 pm, got cervadil, was told to sleep & relax, that labor would be the next day... cervadil ended up giving me hard unbearable contractions all night long, i never slept. Pitocin was started around 5am the next morning, and contractions got worse and worse... I wasn't progressing as fast as I should have but my contractions were hard and about 1 minute apart... I got an epidural around 4 cm and never progressed any further than that, so at 2pm I had to have a c-section.    all i have to say is... if you are getting induced, BE PREPARED FOR A C-SECTION!! I did not listen to people who told me that... and even the doctor who sent me to get admitted and induced told me there is a 50% chance that the induction will end in a c-section. I thought "not me"... but I was wrong. I am glad now that i had a c-section though. Everything was fine, my son was healthy, and I recovered nicely. in about 2-3 weeks I was pretty much back to normal.    Good luck!
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Your due date is my birthday! :D    Any-who nothing is wrong with nuts. Your baby gets the nutrients from the food you eat,but they aren't actually eating the nut itself.   Just since the re-call of peanut butter products,make sure what you're eating isn't on that list!!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	lol, i shouldnt worry hunni, honestly.    best wishes and hugs 2 u and lil bump xx|`|AA11795652	Don't worry.  I ate nuts and peanut butter with both pregnancies and my kids are fine.|`|JxVx0GXiaa	i ate nuts during pregnancy and my baby was fine. i think this is only applicable to people who have family history of nut allergies, etc.|`|H0fXySX9aa	unless any one has a nut allergy or asthma in your family or you have it you can eat nuts until your hearts content|`|PwhrTNZraa	Honestly, that's just silly.  Unless your allergic to nuts, why wouldn't you eat them while pregnant?  Half the time I only get my protein from peanut butter and/or nuts because I have hardly any appetite for meat right now.  As long as your not pigging out, nuts are extremely healthy for you whether your pregnant or not.    And, my 3yo daughter LOVES peanut butter and has NO allergies to anything.|`|u2zEvkEkaa	4 mouthfuls will not harm your baby.Just don't eat it excessively.|`|gmZChnETaa	I heard they tll you that, just in case your baby has a peanut allergy. you probably dont have to worry about it if you dont have that sort of thing run in your family or the fathers family. :)|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Your midwife is a quack.  Unless you have huge history of food allergies peanuts are perfectly safe when you're pregnant and even when you're nursing.  The products that are being recalled for salmonella have peanut butter/paste not actual nuts.|`|A68od1sbaa	they say avoid nuts incase baby develops an allergy to them and because of vitamin A which can cause nerve disorders. but when you think about it its almost impossible to completely avoid nuts. i dont think it would have done any harm. everything in moderation.  think of the women that still take drugs and drink alcohol all the way through pregnancy and still have healthy baby's (well kind of. some are born addicts). It shows we care more about our babies when we are worried about a few nuts :-) but seriously it wont have done any harm.
UAunAKdtaa	yeah like they said, you need to wake her up in the morning and not ler her sleep for like 4 hours. help her develop a pattern.she will normally wake up around 5 30 am, eat, do whatever, thel sleep until 9 or so, you need to wake her up, feed her, and from then keep it rolling, take her out for a stroll, play a little, discover her new or not so new swing chair, show her a shiny ball...then around noon she should pass out again, and wake up hungry 3 hours later.thing is, she will keep having these short sleeps until she is much older, like...7 months old. since her tummy is still tiny, she will wake hungry at night,so dont keep her up all day so that you can get sleep. later, she will change her pattern again, this time in your favor. she will wake around 6 am, play, sleep at about 9 am, then sleep at 3  or so and then at 6 and then from night sleep til midnight only once a night she will wake up.then later she will wake at 8 am, play til noon, nap for 3 hours, then go to sleep at around 8 or 9 pm. be patient. nap with your baby, but help he change this nasty pattern she has currently!|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, you need to play with her during the day to keep her up during the day as much as possible, so when it comes night time she will actually sleep...it might take about a week to get her on a normal sleeping pattern, but instead of letting her sleep those long hours from 5 to 2 try and play with her after like 9 or 10 am so by like 9 pm she is tired and will sleep when you sleep...this is how i got my son on a sleeping pattern and now he sleeps through the night...i hope i was helpfull hun...|`|UPubkDWLaa	My daughter always slept through the night unless she was sick or just wouldnt go to sleep for some reason lol. but all babies are different, some sleep all night and some dont. but what i would do when my daughter didnt sleep in the night, i would keep her up all day that way she will be tired and stay asleep at night. it may be hard but it worked for my daughter. Good Luck! :)|`|J6IOqzL0aa	if she is sleeping straight through from 5.30am to 2pm then she is sleepinh really well for a 3 month old just at completely the wrong time of the day. You need to make it really light in the day and put her in the middle of everything going on so it is noisy and active. then when it get to night time give her a bath and bottle and try and settle her in a dark quiet room. hopefully she will start to get the idea.  Until then you need to sleep when she is sleeping if you can unless you have other children or work to go to. Good Luck|`|lGSUToFQaa	by 5 months i'd say, my son was sleeping at 6 weeks all night, good luck

zK1V9Mu7aa	Ask your midwife to do a membrane sweep on you - unfortunately it does involve her fiddling around down there, but my midwife didn't even look up there, just put her fingers up and did the job. My contractions started the same day and I had him 3 days later. Brilliant! Also, be careful with your waters, mine had broken and I didn't even realise it! A way to check is to pop a pad on and if there is a fluid constantly on it that is straw like in colour, then it is probably your waters. At the end of the day though you have to do what is right for the baby, and your DR's and midwives know what is best so listen to them.  Good Luck xxx|`|LQnKhiVMaa	being induced doesnt hurt more, it just normally comes a lot quicker so there is no real build up to it, in most cases...if u have preeclampsia i would ask to be induced and stay in, if it isnt that, then i would just reest with the phone near by, because, labour can start at any time, when u least expect it, and your so close now, it could be any time x|`|y1NsA6awaa	Hi, if its tiring you out and its becoming really inconvenient having to go to the hospital everyday then i would get induced. I am due to be induced on saturday, obviously i would prefer to go naturally, but its for the best as im overdue. I have been looking at everyone's response and getting opinions from people i know that that have been induced. I have had a mixed response, some people say the contractions come on fast and are painful from the start but others say it was no different from natural labour if anything it went quicker. I think it is different for everybody and you dont know what it will be like until you have had it, but also you have to remember that it doesnt matter how long it takes you will have your baby at the end of it. Thats what i tell myself. But with your symptoms, i personally think being induced is your best option for you and baby. And you never know you might go naturally before your induced date anyway. All the best x
2mIhQgV7aa	A woman can get prganant at anytime even on her period and she can bleed but it's not very common...|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Yes!!!!    You can get pregnant at any time during you cycle.    Before having a period, after having a period and even during a period.    There is no 'safe' time to have unprotected sex without the risk of pregnancy.|`|YseGAHIfaa	not every woman is the same, but i bled [it was only for 2 days] i thought that something was wrong coz my cycle is usually heavier & longer [for 5-7days]    i thought id get a negative result when i took a test, but it came out positive! i'm now 3 months pregnant!     lots of luck x|`|QM6wiVtVaa	A woman can get pregnant at any point in her cycle.  She may or may not bleed.
swL7bQfAaa	Obviously there is no respect in your household where people can just barge in and out of anothers bedroom without knocking, no matter what their age.  How can you expect him to respect you and your privacy if you have no regard for his?    A persons bedroom is their little kingdom within the family home where they at least should expect some privacy and peace, I am sure you expect that in your room!  If I were you. I would be apologizing for forgetting my manners and failing to knock - forget the rest of it it goes without saying.  There is no excuse for bad manners.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Obviously he is still embarrassed by this.  But, like you said it was an accident.  Just say hey I am sorry for walking in on you.  I will knock from now and let it be.  It was an accident.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well, now is the time to implement a house wide knock first policy.  Just mention to him that you are sorry and that from now on everyone in the house is to knock before entering.  Leave it at that and move on.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	I would say now that a little time has passed you need to act casual and have an adult/child conversation with him. Explain that you are very sorry that you walked in on him, but that was not your intention. Tell him that to trust his privacy and will knock his bedroom door and wait for an answer the next time. Tell him you did not realize he was awake and that you feel terrible for walking in on him. Then act very casual, but be sensative to his needs or questions.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Apologize for not knocking and tell him from now on you will knock. Then let it go.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Why would you open the door, and see, yet still walk in. Say sorry and leave|`|PSaXvIyWaa	Yeah I can imagine that would be embarrassing especially for a 14 yr old! But I would speak with him about it. Not only will you be letting him know it was an accident but it will also help open communication lines between the 2 of you and can set the pace for open communication and honesty in many other issues. With him recently being adopted AND being 14 it can be very hard for him to speak open & honestly with you on a variety of things.|`|Z45YUKesaa	Tell him your sorry you walked in on him. You thought he was still sleeping. Tell him you love him and he didn't have anything you hadn't seen before. Tell him you won't come in his room again without knocking. If you need something you'll wait until you know he's up or you'll knock if it's important.|`|m2EGAs8Raa	Tell your son that you are sorry you walked in on him, but to be seen naked realy is no big deal. Tell him that if it had been the other way, him walking in on you naked, you would not mind.|`|AA11971497	Forgive each other for making each other feel awkward about what happened, and move on.  We're all naked beneath our clothing anyway.  It's just the context that makes it awkward to be seen that way.
LiPoEBenaa	I had to go in to maternity pants at 16 weeks. I was still able to wear some of my pre-pregnancy jeans up to like 24 weeks or so due to using a hair band and looping it through the button hole and attatching it to the button. I'm 35 weeks now and I'm lovin' the maternity pants. I call them my "all you can eat buffet pants" cause of the super stretchy tummy panel. My family gets a kick out of that!|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Now's the time to start wearing your maternity clothes. You'll feel so much more comfy. I began wearing them when I was almost 16 weeks. My waist was getting bigger & regular clothing was binding. I wasn't really showing much until I was six month's pregnant, but I got into maternity clothing when I could no longer stand regular slacks, skirts, etc. Who cares what people think?  Be comfy!|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'm 19 weeks and don't need maternity clothes yet... Just bras and I went ahead and bought some more comfortable underwear because most of my underwear are thongs and it's just not comfortable to me anymore. .|`|VR9KhbEgaa	With my first son I was in maternity clothes by 14 weeks, I can tell you that I also gained over 60 lbs. during that pregnancy! With my last child,  6, I did not ever wear maternity bottoms just tops and lots of the empire waist dresses, I only gained 24 lbs. with him. Just remember the more you gain the more you have to loose....it took me 5 years to loose the weight I gained from my first 4 children...and then I had 2 more babies within 11 mths! So I am once again stuck with 15 pounds I need to loose!|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I have to be in maternity clothes almost from the start.  I just pop really fast and nothing fits and the really crazy thing is that with both of my pregnancies I have had really, really bad morning sickness  and lose at least 20 lbs each time... in fact I and due any day now and still have 4 lbs that I can gain before I hit my pre-pregnancy weight. Just remember that you will get bigger and bigger till the day you deliver so get a few things in different sizes... My maternity clothes range from a medium up to an ex-large and I need them all!!!  Good luck!|`|MqFeJiukaa	I was in my 5th month.  Now I am 35 weeks and sick of them!  If you are uncomfortable who cares what people think pull out the maternity clothes.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	i started wearing mat clothing at about 4 months|`|gJDPrl6maa	i never had to wear them. i just kept going up in sizes ofjeans i started in a 3 and ended in a 12..

Gl!|`|2zJPgOcIaa	around 4 months. but it's better to be comfortable than worry about what everyone is thinking. get them out and get them ready. go for it. enjoy being pregnant, cause it doesn't last very long at all! good luck and congrats!|`|cSm1zod4aa	I got into maternity clothes at 13 weeks.. this is my first baby... if they give you that look just be like.. what? its comfortable!

The ones I wore before i got pregnant were already considerably "close fitting" and weren't stretchy so they didn't last long once i started to pooch out a little. Bottom line, they are SUPER comfy and I'm considering never going back. lol :)|`|5ETje6DTaa	only halloween i was 5 months and i was wearing regular clothes.maybe a size 5?    i just wore a bigger size. i was a 3 and went to a 7/9 only because i gained 52lbs lol with my son.|`|0fd9txsPaa	Try the bella band by isabel and ingrid, it helps you to wear your prepregnancy clothing longer.  Good Luck!  http://www.bumpfashion.com
PuqlSfKcaa	No. They are considered coupons to the consumer [you] and a check to stores.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ummmm  NO|`|VClxXNs3aa	read the check.    I dont have any similac ones, but I have an enfamil check I am looking at.  NO they are NOT considered coupons, they ARE checks, if they were coupons then you could not use "another" coupon with the checks when you buy formula, but you can use the check and a coupon together, but anywaysss...    the enfamil is made out to "Enfamil retailer" not to the consumer, so it would be fraud for you to cash it at the bank.  also, on the back, it says "endorsement of this check certifies that it was received in conjunction with the purchase and sale of next step lipil toddler formula only. further proof of purchase may be required."    so, the short answer is no, you cannot cash the checks.  but, you can sell them on ebay :)|`|db17fabf0780755dd8df8c51bfdb141daa	If it's a check made out to you or consumer, yes...if it's a coupon, no...that's only toward purchases.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	you have to have a gun and a similac coupon

See a doctor right away, so that you will know what lifestyle changes you need to make so thet your pregnancy will be as comfortable as possible.    In the meantime, don't drink, smoke, or do drugs.
ZnHTfNycaa	I don't think that mothers are always closer to a child than the father.   I think both parents offer the child something that the other one wouldn't be able to give.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Because father is farther.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	It is because mother is fact and father is faith.    It is because that it is mother who supplied blood, oxygen and milk/noursihment for the survival and carried their wastes.    It is because it is mother who carried the child throughout the pregnancy period.    It is because she bore the labour pain.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Mothers have the maternal instinct.|`|AA10329469	Because we are relay  a part of Her.|`|bghotovYaa	Well your Mom gave birth to you and your father didn't.

That's why she is closer to you than the father.|`|y6wo6dRMaa	It is not true.  Both are close to a child.
3CG3rby0aa	You are not supposed to be spotting like that so I would call your doctor.  Something could be wrong like the placenta coming loose from your uterine wall.  So I would call the doctor asap.  just to be safe for you and the baby.  good luck!|`|nlKZRNqmaa	Call your OB ... better safe than sorry!
6lyvhRLsaa	I have one, I love it!  my son falls off to sleep easily in it, it does feel very secure. I've not used it for breastfeeding as yet though I could see it being practical. The only problem I found was when he was a new born he was kinda swamped by it, I started using it properly around 3 months.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	I used one and found it absolutely awful. Although my son did feel secure whilst lying down in it in other positions like sitting up he felt very unsecured and i worried he may fall out. I also found it rather difficult to place my son in the sling without any help.    I cannot comment on the breastfeeding aspect as by the time i had brought the sling i had stopped breastfeeding my son.|`|pYyIkljBaa	never heard of it. but i use heart to heart. and its FANTASTIC. check it out! www.heart2heart.com

She is only young so she doesn't fully understand why she can't get the attention. Or try enrolling her in a different preschool, maybe it will be better than the first one :)    As for the twins, here are some combinations:    Lily Grace and Sophia Renee    Savannah Paige and Ruby Makiya    Kiara Louise and Zoe Rachel    Amelia Kate and Isabelle Skye    Emma Noelle and Arabelle Piper    Lauren Sophie and Audrey Hannah    Chloe Michelle and Eloise Caitlin    Kayleigh Hope and Olivia Rose    Matilda Emily and Claudia Grace      Hope this helps!!! :)|`|IDmaxViIaa	ok well i did not read this but i like the names Lisa and rina or Annabella or Anna or Annabell with the middle name maree and 4 the second twin Chelsey middle name lee.|`|TAufQoc7aa	Hi there    How about     Lillia Beth  and  Jemma Kate    ?|`|32K93DP4aa	aurora blake lyn and sienna nevaeh rose  jaylyn faith marie and jaydyn grace ann  kaylee jane marie and kylee madison renee|`|LgLpJxnwaa	oww i really wanna answer but its so much reading.  lol.    so sorry.  first sentence :  Jade is a nice name :)|`|MBHkcmB4aa	Yasmine... that is the name of my beautiful cousin who passed away from cancer.

3jUHw9yWaa	First of congrats on being worried. better paranoid then stupid. no thats not sarcasm...i know people who are like 8 months pregnant and sitting in hot tubs and saunas.    okay go get an ultra sound.  things are ALWAYS different with every pregnancy.  the way you feel and stuff.  so go your dr tell him/her your concerns and make sure they are fully addressed so your not stressing yourself out while your pregnant.|`|15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	I don't think that any momen can 'not' be paranoid over her babies. Anyways, if you are worried....why wait at all? Contact a good gynaecologist now and discuss your concerns.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your doctor hasn't said anything about your growth you should not be worrying. Also at 26 weeks the kicks aren't going to be as frequent nor as strong consistently like they will be later. Just for your peace of mind I would CALL your midwife. You can call in between appointments if something is really bothering you. It will take the stress away. You should keep the stress to a minimum. :) Of course.
jIQKc1dAaa	you sound like me. I'm paranoid like that, but seriously if you had sex without a condom and take your pill regularly then theres only .1% chance you could be, then add a condom and the fact that you had to of had sex around ovulation. With all factors its VERY VERY unlikely.|`|SjYbkWdQaa	YOUR NOT PREGNANT!  people do that everyday for yrs, and not get pregnant. lol. your being safe. dont stop that.|`|kxcuSPmkaa	Most women ovulate 2 weeks before the start of their period. The egg is only able to be fertilized for about 3 days surrounding the ovulation. Your ova likely had passed it's fertile window about 10 days prior. Plus, with the birth control, you didn't ovulate. No egg. No pregnancy.     But I remember those freak outs back in the day before I got married. I think it is normal to worry. Be secure in the knowledge that you've been very proactive.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	.00001%, I pulled that number out of my *** but really. You used a condom AND are on birth control. It would be hard for Superman to get through that! :)    ADD: No, I mean Superman's supersperm. LOL|`|RgZ5n0b4aa	ellasmom dont you mean supersperm to get through that lol. no ur not pregnant dear. =]|`|bLluZIeTaa	very very low chance if you used a condom and your on birth control,so stop freaking out your not pregnant,good luck|`|7e86dc249e02eda2f37c61a8f9972f0aaa	Is this question a joke? I mean seriously!!!! :)|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Prob not. It requires sperm to reach a fertilized egg. The birth control and condom probably prevented that. Why are you so paranoid?! First time?|`|oaJcgz3uaa	Not very likely.  Sometimes you can have a late period, even while on the pill.  High stress can be a factor in the delay or missing of your period.  I'd wait until about five days after your period should have come (if it doesn't come) and take a pregnancy test.      Is there any reason you're worried?  Using a condom in addition to birth control gives you almost zero risk, so I really wouldn't be concerned if I were you.
qoh1iNi9aa	Honey, why are you doing this all alone? Where's the baby's father in all this? What about your own parents?  I'm sorry I don't have any easy answers, but you baby will not hate you because you gave her up. She will have the chance of a good life, which, frankly you might have problems  giving her at the moment  (sorry if this sounds harsh.)   What you could do is write her a letter, telling her all about the situation and why you are doing this and how much you love her. Enclose a photo of yourself, seal it into an envelope, and ask the parents to keep it for her and give it to her later when she's sold enough.  As a committed Christian, I believe in prayer, so I'm going to add a prayer for you now, which you can accept or not as you please.  Father God, I bring Butterfly to You now. You know the state she is in and her worries and concerns. Please draw close to her and give her Your blessing and Your strength to cope with things.Give her Your comfort, please Lord, in Jesus' Name amen.    God bless you honey, and I hope everything works out for you. If you want to email me, please go to my profile.|`|VAZaZ9s9aa	You should get an abortion.    The child will grow up with the genetics of an irresponsible person, and will cause hassles for her adoptive parents. Think of this child: do you want them to go through this for your sake, because you're selfish and made a bad choice?    I feel so sorry for the both of you.    Also, the world is WAY overpopulated. We should fill the world with more good people who have loving, responsible parents rather than broken people with irresponsible ones.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	I must say - well done.  I admire your strenght.  You didn't take the easy way out, took responsibility and made a choice to give your baby the best for him/her.  That alone shows alot about your character.  I think you shouldn't beat yourself up about this.  I hope that you can find some form of support through this - good luck.|`|YYiI28nNaa	You shouldn't have sex in the first place! don't give it up raise it, and in the future you will know why|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	im so sorry ur going thought this but if you dont want to give your baby up dont do it email me at katherineajsexy@aol.com and i can really talk to you please email me so i can talk to you.|`|uT6a9KSOaa	If you cannot care for a a living human being on your own then you are doing the right thing. I think the child will learn to understand in later years. You will be there and she will very much appreciate that her mother did not totally give up on her and that you are still in her life. You are very brave for giving her up! But you are young and cannot take care of her the way she deserves. You are going through a rough time but never doubt yourself when if you know you are doing the right thing. And even better, still being in her life, giving her the privilege of knowing her mother.....I know you dont know me..and these are only words but I do hope this helps. =]|`|id6lv7kaaa	I'm sorry your doing this all alone. I had my daughter at age 16, and i couldnt imagine my life without her.|`|VHHis05Naa	Make sure you're sure about this.  I think you are very courageous.  Maybe you could write the baby a letter to explain why you are doing this.  It might make you feel better and someday she can understand.      If you have any doubts about this, hold off telling these people until you feel more sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I have an adopted friend and she doesn't hate her birth mother. She was raised in a loving home and is grateful for getting the chance to have a good life, which she does have. This is a very difficult process but you're doing an amazingly unselfish thing. If you can I would talk to your guidance counselor at school. She'll probably be able to give you some support. Good luck honey.|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	As a childless mother all I can say is you are not abandoning your baby in fact you are giving her the best thing you can a set of parents hand picked. Someday in your life if you are ready to be a parent you will have that option. The people who you are giving this baby to might not ever have that option. We hope and pray everyday for a young woman as smart and unselfish as yourself to bless us with a baby also. So all I can say is make sure you know what your doing hun this is very important for you, them, and the baby.|`|ALC0oqWyaa	I think what you are considering will most likely provide the best possible future for your daughter that you are currently able to give.  If you are making this decision alone, you would also be raising her alone, which is not fair on either of you.  I don't believe she will hate you or think you abandoned her - she will be grateful for the oportunity you have given her.  Perhaps, to ease your mind, you could write her a letter and give it to the adoptive parents to give her when she starts asking questions?  Explain your reasons for giving her up, how much you love her and maybe even some things about yourself that she might find useful.  Because you love  her, I know that you will make the best decision for her future that you can.  I can only imagine how difficult this decision is for you and applaud your consideration of all the options.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	OMG! you are my hero!!! when i was 19 i almost gave my daughter up but keep her. sweetie it will be hard, but you are making the right choice. your a kid who needs to have fun, finish school and date. and the little girl needs stability. im happy you didn't have a abortion, that says allot about you, and how stronge you are. if ever you need to talk email me. allison_r_lee@hotmail.com|`|1Du4Rudvaa	You are doing a wonderful thing for your girl.  You are not abandoning her at all.  You are giving her to a wonderful family that without you could not have a child.  What a lucky child, a biological mother that loves her and is thinking about her best interests and also having a loving adopted family.  This will probably be the hardest decision you will have to make in your life and I think the only thing that will ease the pain will be through time.      I have known many children that were adopted and when they got older they wanted to know their biological parents.  None of them were mad at their biological mom.  Most felt like they had two sets of parents(in a good way).|`|Coc593Ikaa	Adoption is hard. I swear, answerers on here tell other women to adopt out their baby like it should be as easy as giving away a pair of shoes. Adoption is not an easy solution. It is difficult for you. I'm sure it is frustrating to you how cavalier others treat it. But right now you have your baby and soon you will not. Even with an open adoption, "your" baby will no longer be that. It will be "their" baby. But the key point is that you love her. With that comes the need to do what is best for her. I don't know you. I don't know your situation. I wouldn't dream of telling you to keep your baby or to give it up. Only you can know which will be best for her future. If you know that it is best, then so will she. You will have the ability to have some contact with her, and I expect she will understand. Convey to her that you have given her up out of love. That you wanted more for her than you could give.|`|GwNx6mfTaa	You may be young and alot of people on here will probably tell you it's best for the child, and it may be. But if you have anyone to help you out, you CAN do it. You are the only one to make this decision. It's a hard one..   You have to think of what would be best for the child, if you have funds to raise a child. But if deep down you think you should keep your baby then you should. Believe me follow what your heart really wants, I done something years ago with my baby that I still regret. Don't let anyone inflence you. If you decide to keep your baby though, you need to stay busy doing some kind of schooling so that you may get a good education and provide your child with a good life [:   Good Luck to you and your decision..|`|wJJzYQsraa	You are doing the right thing if you feel that the baby will be happier. A true loving parent will do what is best for the child. If it helps my mom's friend was pregnant at a very young age and gave up her child. Later down the road (when he was forty) she saw him again and felt so happy because he had a life that she could never give him. I don't think your baby will hate you. When they are older they will better understand. And depending on what the parents you pick think it doesn't mean you can't be in her life. I hope this helps. Best luck to you.
h4Sc2JDwaa	you doc is a quack! take her to the hospital your darn self..your her mom, what are your motherly instincts telling you to do.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No, no, don't let her get dehydrated!    What you need to realise is that just because she is ill doesn't mean that doctors have some magic wand they can wave to make her better. It might make _you_ feel better for them to fuss over her and admit her to hospital and do lots of tests...but your poor little baby just wants to be at home being loved.    Go to the chemist, ask their advice on the best sort of rehydration drinks, and for some really serious cream to put on her sore bottom. Then ring the doctor, tell him there is no change, and ask him how long you should carry on just observing since she is not improving at all. Push him to be clear. Say "if she is no better by this time tomorrow do I bring her back to see you?"     I know it's hard when there's nothing you can do - but the last thing your little girl wants is to be poked and prodded by a bunch of strangers in hospital if there's nothing they can do anyway - not to mention the risk you would be putting her at from cross-infection from other kids who are really seriously sick.    Hang in there. If she is worse, take her straight back to the doctors. Otherwise, just keep her comfortable and hydrated as best you can, and wait it out. Believe me, it's more comfortable waiting it out at home than in hospital.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Its time to go pack her up and go to the ER. Her poor hiney poor baby, keep that cream on it.  Let them do what it takes, dehydration...............is a killer, number one killer in alot of poor nations. Go take her now. Your out of the pediatlyte or whatever, so just go, and hopefully they will get control of this. I wish you and thebaby all the best hun. Sorry sometimes babies do this and theres no real reason, once their tummy and intestines get all out of whack it can be hard to get them back to normal. Get her help so you know shes on the road to recovery. The Dr was kinda right, although he didnt know you couldnt afford the drink anymore.|`|VClxXNs3aa	does she have a fever or any other symptoms??  it sounds like teething if not, even a fever can still indicate teething.   symptoms of teething are messy diapers, diaper rash, fever, rash on the face, swollen gums,  irritable, runny nose...........    ask the hospital or dr to check her ketone levels in her urine.  have them put her on a covered bed with no diaper and there are dipsticks, that will show if she is dehydrated truely or not.|`|9f8XoDKJaa	As long as shes drinking then shes will most likely be ok.  Pedialyte I think its called will work but I found that most dont like the taste.    All else fails go back to doctor and or go to hospital.    If they say you are over reacting then have a go at them. Remeber you pay there wages and have to help if your concerned.  even if they are Nhs losers.|`|CY8jAXPDaa	What is it with the ignorant comments to your answer?    Hun, what i would do is get down to the hospital, see someone that actually gives a damn because your doctor obviously isn't concerned.  My son went through this, but he wasn't as bad. He was "pooing" up to 7 times a day, i took him to the doctors who straight away booked us for an appointment at the hospital for a full examination the next say.  They also have me re-hydration drinks for my son, until his appointment the next day.   He was checked over, and fine after a few days, but your daughters sounds a lot worse.   I wouldn't stand for this treatment off of your doctor, get straight down to the hospital, demand help, and make a fuss.  Let them know which doctor at your surgery wasn't helping, because i can assure you the hospital won't be happy with the treatment on your daughter.  Good luck.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	Take her to the hospital and the heck with the doctor you are seeing find a new one and DO NOT GIVE HER WATER it could cause more problems like seizures and stuff from water intoxication stick with pedylite or something along them lines !|`|AA10811426	Hospital.    Take her to someone that will help her.  You  know as a mom she needs help so take her to the doctors.  Not the same one as last time but a new one that will do something.    Make a fuss when you are there - as a mom you know when your child needs help.|`|AA11567932	Right, despite what you might be thinking in terms of desperation, please please do not starve her of vital fluids. Go out to the chemist and buy some more.  The doctor is right, she has a tummy upset and the only thing you can do is replace the fluids lost and not feed her anything. You are right to be concerned but unless she becomes very weak and refuses to drink then you can start assuming she will not get better on her own.    Please trust in what he is saying, Ive been through the same twice with both my children so I know. I kept on with the fluids and eventually it made them better. Then I introduced food once the bad tummy symptoms had gone. If you feed her you are feeding the bug and it will never go.|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	I would take her to the hospital, regardless of what the doctor told me.  That just doesn't sound right to me. When my daughter was around that age, and was sick throwing up, they told me to continue to feed her the formula and give her pedialyte. I say better to be safe than sorry.|`|490e4f226b74a4050a4f5768c24d97e9aa	Take her to another Dr. who DOES care!! In the meantime, use cornstarch for powder on her raw red bottom, and restock your re hydration drinks for her. Please take her somewhere else right away. Poor baby!! And by all means Do Not let her get worse!!|`|Fjm7RnD2aa	Your Doctor is wrong to tell you this. Phone up your health visitor and tell her the whole story. The Doctor also should have told you to just half the amount of formula not stop it all together. She sounds like she has a stomach bug but it isn't shifting if she is still pooing every hour. Don't let her get really poorly but be persistant at the Doctors and if you need to take her to the hospital then do this, he should have sent a poo sample away to test for infection. She may need anti-biotics. Sometimes babies do get a lot of pooey nappies due to new food they are having. However this does not sound normal and at the very least the doctors should have taken a poo sample. Phone your health visitor though, you shouldn't feel alone like this. Someone needs to give you some help and reassurance x|`|Un3hiHpUaa	do u live in the uk? take your daughter straight to the hospital and demand someone to see your daughter, they need to, they will anyway. they are more likely to be any help than a gp.  If anything happens to my nieces/nephews their parents take them straight to hospital.  It could be a stomach problem, like gastroenteritis but i am no expert or it could just be a stomach bug or something most probably but you will still need medicine.  That is your best chances if you think something is wrong and it sounds like you are not over exaggerating, also you could join net doctor site and people can help you there if you submit questions, they always help me! good luck.|`|zRc4Swewaa	Go to another doctor and ask them to blood test her for dehydration.My second son was confined because of dehydration when he was six months old.First i brought him in a clinic because he stool is soft and watery and has fever,the doctor gave me medicine but the medicine made his stool more watery and often after 2 days of drinking and i took him again in the clinic and the doctor referred me to a hospital that's bigger and was found that my little boy was dehydrating...was confined for a week and got well.He is now 12yrs.old.But in your case the doctor is not worried enough so you MUST consult another one,the diagnosis is wrong and you have to move especially if diarrhea is accompanied by fever.I remember i was told by the doctor that I can give her milk half the formula and add the usual amount of water.To give her some energy and to stop her from screaming and crying.Your doctor seems not to care,you're the only one who cares so better consult another doctor.Hope your baby will be fine.....|`|o9wQgTmRaa	My doctor always used to say to me that if I was concerned as a Mother, then he was concerned. If you are really worried, I would take your daughter to hospital, rather than going to your doctor.  It could be nothing but it is best to get her checked out.  There is nothing wrong with admitting her into hospital for observation if it will either highlight a problem or put your mind at rest.|`|P7pZo7Ztaa	It sounds like your baby is lactose intolerant. You need to go back to your doctor and explain in a calm and relaxed manner that you believe that you baby is unwell and the advise he/she had given you previously did not work. Explain to the doctor what you have explained here, but you need to be relaxed and calm or they will think that you are over reacting. If that doesn't work then i really don't know what you should do. But you need to be persistent to your doctor until you are satisfied with their advise procedures. Good Luck!|`|zhqSxJS9aa	are there any other doctors you can take her to. is there anything different she's had, my heart goes out to you theres nothing worse then noone listening when you know somethings wrong.  keep trying and good luck i hope your little one gets better soon.|`|lOZF75iWaa	If she's dehydrated, THEN GIVE HER WATER!!!!|`|TONBZsw4aa	Aaw my love it is heartbreaking when little ones are ill.    Do get some more re hydration drinks, it's very very important not to let her get dehydrated.     You should take her back to the doctors, but I would ask to see a different GP - diarrhoea that persists for more than 2 to 3 days requires medical attention. Also if the doctor decides hospital is the way forward, they can admit her so you don't have to wait around in A&E. She'll be seen much more quickly.     There is more info here:     http://adam.about.com/encyclopedia/nutri...    Do continue feeding her, as this can help stop the diahorrea.     I've also just read through this info which has a helpful section at the end about sore bottoms (which is likely why she cries so much when she poos):    http://www.drgreene.com/21_581.html     Hope she gets better soon x|`|FuwZYjGvaa	For the person who wrote give her water, water is not enough you need nutrients also, that are found in pedialyte and such drinks.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	I have never in my 15 years as a mom EVER heard of depriving a child of food during an illness like this. The re-hydration drinks are meant to SUPPLEMENT and be given in addition to formula....also your baby is certainly old enough to be given a little rice cereal. Try feeding her abit of rice cereal, giving her her normal formula and a bit of re-hydration drink. Those drinks do NOT provide the strength your child gets from her normal diet to fight this bug. ALSO take her to a hospital and let them know exactly what is going on and what you've been feeding (or not feeding ) her.|`|Ij2rM3H4aa	Do NOT let her get dehydrated just so you can make the point to the doctor.  Dehydration in babies is not something you play around with, and is not like dehydration in adults- in babies, it kills very quickly.  Take it from me, as a mom whose baby had to be hospitalized for dehydration (my daughter's sucking reflex wasn't strong enough at birth and it wasn't spotted by me, breastfeeding as a first time mum, or by all the midwives and lactation consultants)- she and we had to endure a frantic trip to A&E when she suddenly became comatose, emergency IVs and tubes in her nose to hydrate her, and three days of sleepless worry at her bedside before she woke up.
jchCJZxTaa	ok;  what i would do is;  if it is a wooden cot, maybe go to a hardware stall buy a sheet of wood and put i whaere the bars are!  or i woud get the toddler bed, but add the side that protects them from falling out!    you have to be careful because he could bruise his leg, or hurt it bad one day...    mybe its an attention thing!
YrK7S8xtaa	doesnt sound like it would be much of a break|`|t7qcjqWIaa	I know its tough to leave your son, even for a little while, but you're going to have to spend a little time apart sooner or later, and now seems like a good time to do it. I felt the same way I first time I was apart from my daughter, but she and I both did just fine. Even if you don't like your in-laws, I would still go, just to keep the peace with them and with your partner. When you're apart from your son, keep in mind you can always call and talk to him, even if he doesn't understand what you're saying. It's ok, go ahead and go. Sounds like it will be good for you...|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	If I didn't want to leave my toddler (and I never wanted to leave ANY of my own three toddlers), I just wouldn't.  A lot of mothers don't want to leave their children when they're that young.  I think  you should tell him you'll bring you child or else just stay home and enjoy a little quiet time with your child while he goes and "enjoys" time with "just his family".|`|irLnPW4aaa	How about going and bringing your son?|`|eu6UQElYaa	He's trying to guilt trip you into taking this trip with him?   That doesn't really sound like he has your best interests in mind at all for this.   He should be able to understand that you don't want to be away from your son for that long.  I mean a break is only beneficial if it is one that you feel comfortable taking and you clearly don't feel comfortable with this break.     I really see no reason why he NEEDS you to go on this trip.  And personally I really hate it when people pull that "If you love me" bs, I find it extremely childish.   Just tell him you aren't comfortable with it and if he pitches a fit then so be it.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I think its pretty slack he is making you choose one over the other.    ALWAYS trust your instincts.|`|gkThLcf2aa	f**k it, just  go. absence makes the heart grow fonder, baby|`|AA11795652	Trust your instincts.  If you can, take your son with you.  He'll probably just sleep most of the time in the 5-hour drive.  Your partner will have to understand.  On the other hand, if you feel you can trust your niece and sis-in-law 100%, then remind yourself that your son would be in good hands and try to enjoy some special time with your partner.  I know this sounds lame, but write a list of pros and cons of leaving your son and see what you come up with.  Good luck!  I would have a hard time too.  My daughter just turned 4 years old and my sister-in-laws (both in the early 20's and who have no kids) wanted to take her 5-6 hours away.  Luckily, we had a very important engagement already planned so we had an easy way out but I was proud of my husband for immediately telling me that he wouldn't have approved.  However, if they were "moms" (make that great moms) I might have considered it.
Oj5oZYJ4aa	That's exactly how I felt right before I found out that I was pregnant.  Very light cramping but very annoying bloating.   However I guess I always felt like that when my period was coming too so I don't know. I would go to your OB and get a blood test done.|`|x6IyESABaa	It's normal pregnancy symptoms. It will be best if you check with your doctor since you had a miscarriage before. I felt really bloated and have light cramps during the 1st trimester also.    All the best!

57b47866a23aafae5935da2e945386b2aa	My siblings and I never believed in Santa and we always had WONDERFUL Christmases. There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing not to lie to your child. I don't lie to my daughter and we celebrate Christmas every year with joy. She looks forward to it and we've made our own traditions. (We celebrate it for it's original meaning, ie the birth of Christ) We exchange tons of gifts and have family over. Its a very joyful time for all of us.    But I think its the parents decision to be made. Its not your place to decide how your Aunt and her daughter celebrate. So just be supportive and don't encourage her belief if you don't agree with it, but don't interfere either. Just be there for her when she needs you.|`|AA11637178	Do you really want to take part of your cousins childhood away? Let the child believe. It does not hurt a thing! What you want to do will hurt her more. My child believed. It puts a little magic in the world. And as she got older her belief started to wane. Each year her belief was not as strong as the year before.|`|Wnmg850Paa	That is just mean to burst her bubble.It is causing no harm for her to believe. It would be much more fun for the both of you to believe in the magic of Christmas. As she gets older she will most likely grow out of it on her own with no hurst feelings or shock and Christmas will remain special. Just let her be a kid. There are enough disappointments a head of her without you  ruining Santa for her.|`|mLUELEkFaa	Christmas is far more than Santa Claus, it is about the spirit of Christmas  Once a child doesnt believe in santa anymore, they lose belief in so many other things. By telling them your forcing them to grow up too fast. Sure it is heart breaking when you find out, but it is also part of growing up, and the child can help other younger kids to believe.|`|3J3IH2maaa	no that is all part of childhood and they need to find out for themselves because if not and you tell them it can devastate them and they may not be the same after words!!!!!!!!!|`|UUpsa35Daa	I don't think anybody should purposely tell  child that Santa isn't real...especially if they've been believing for so long. It's just plain mean. Why would you want to ruin that for your cousin? For your own selfish reasons because you didn't get to believe? She'll figure it out on her own when the time is right and she most likely won't even be too upset.    It's not you place to step in and "make sure" she doesn't believe next year. If i was your aunt and you had told my child Santa wasn't real or purposely played a part in my child finding out Santa wasn't real, i'd be upset too.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	That's selfish. Christmas is supposed to be magical for kids... they're supposed to believe in these things and then be disappointed when they find out Santa isn't real but feel happy remembering how they used to act and how hard their parents tried. I can't wait untill my baby is old enough to run around opening presents from santa for being a good girl all year. I think it's just special and something that should be embraced, rather than looked at as a negative thing. Telling your cousin and taking that smile and special feeling out of Christmas for her will be the biggest mistake you make.|`|NysFTExhaa	Since she still believes, she'll find out soon he doesn't exist.  Just wait for someone else to break it to her.    I will not tell my kids Santa exists. I plan on telling my kids the history behind how Santa came about and that people tell their kids he still exists. Tell them about St. Nicholas, the different traditions all over the world, explain why people give gifts on that day and stress that the day is about family togetherness and good will. Not telling your kids that a fat man in red is going to give them presents doesn't mean you're killing their childhood or hurt them in any way, Jewish kids seem to be just fine.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Look, I believed in Santa very strongly as a child.  When I found out he wasn't real, I was kind of bummed, but my heart wasn't "ripped out".  Same for my friends and my husband and everyone else I talked to about it (I was questioning it before deciding whether or not I would have my kids believing in Santa Claus.     It turns out that for most of us, we'd much rather have had the experience of the magic of believing in Santa and then finding out the truth then never getting to believe in him at all.  It wasn't harmful and it added excitement and joy that we otherwise would've missed out on.    Besides, it's not your place to decide whether or not your cousin should believe in Santa or not.   That's solely up to the parents and you need to let them parent how they feel is best.   Leave it alone.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	it's not your place to tell her or help her realize there is no santa she is young enough that she should be allowed to believe in fairy tales it won't break her heart when she realizes there is no santa because she will be old enough to know and reason with that you are her cousin not her mother and you need to leave it alone.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Have kids lots of them 6 to be exact all grown and many grand kids. Yes i don't see anything wrong with believing in Santa. They will find out eventually i guess. I don't know, i still and always will believe in Santa. I believe that Santa is indeed the spirit of Christmas and that Spirit that is in all the hearts and minds of the people that understand what Christmas means. It about giving your heart wither that means presents or your time, Its about making someone else feel hope and goodness and most importantly love. And if you look deep into the eyes of a child during Christmas you will see santa. Merry Christmas!|`|EMKuBql8aa	It's not your kid, stay out of it. Let the parents decide things like that, it is none of your business.     I believed in Santa and my heart wasn't ripped when i found out. Tons of kids find out everyday, it's really no big deal.|`|MzgecQSLaa	Eventually, your cousin will grow out of it. Kids at school talk about how Santa is fake, and then maybe she will get the picture. It's kind of like a peer pressure thing, I suppose.|`|bghotovYaa	I have never believed in Santa.  And I am really grateful for that.  I don't know whether you can win the aunt over with this one but when your cousin does find out...it will probably hit her really hard.  My friend who was 10 years old, told the entire class what Santa had bought him, he was laughed at and made fun of.  He ran away in tears and didn't trust his parents (which is understandable) for ages.|`|HclKftzAaa	I remember when i realized that santa wasn't real. And it didn't devastate me.    in fact, i am SO grateful to my parents for letting me believe in Santa. It made xmas so much more special and magical. And I can't wait to give that to my kids.    You don't know that she'll be hurt and upset if she finds out that santa isn't real. And besides which, it would be mean of you to make sure she DOES find out.     Also, if she found out and went crying to mum about santa not being real, they would just tell her he IS real again, and she'd be mad at whoever lied to her about him NOT being real.    maybe you're just jealous cause you don't believe and Santa doesn't come to you anymore.|`|kdSuwt8paa	I think it is fun for children to believe in Santa - and I think it would be much more hurtful if somebody sat her down and MADE her listen to the fact that he doesn't exist than for her to come to the gradual realisation that he is just for fun.   And it is fun.   Let her believe.   It won't last for too many more years, if any!|`|I5P2bbgWaa	troll|`|5f6XnInEaa	Your cousin will grow out of it on her own time.    Mind your own business.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Most 6 year olds still believe in Santa, she'll begin to figure to out gradually and know before middle school starts. Let her have her last few Christmases with Santa.|`|OG3lycSPaa	I agree with you, I don't think its right to make kids believe in something that's not real. Kids should get to know the truth about their world. And grow up with understanding instead of adults confusing them to hold something over their heads for bad behavior. I don't know how much effort you should put in trying to stop your cousin from believing. Even if you do say something your aunt will just deny it and keep pushing Santa on the kid. I don't think your being selfish, I think you have genuine concern for your cousin and thats sweet. Good luck.|`|5aKUV5afaa	Let her belive in Santa.  You are so mean.  She will figure out, in her own time, that he's not real.  You are evil if you tell her.|`|ZVngHOBTaa	let her keep the magic    i had great christmas's as a kid when santa existed.    im sure she will get over it when she finds he does not exist it wont be the end of the world|`|1fd7gSNvaa	You should let the kid be a kid.   You only get to really feel & be that innocent once in your life.   Christmas for kids is suppose to be magical & exciting.   There are plenty of kids that find out santa isn't really every year & their hearts aren't broken.   When its time to find out, your cousin will find out.   I think you should let her have fun believing for a while.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	Yes I want my kids to believe. I don't want MY kid to be the one on the playground telling everyone else how Santa doesn't exist and being the one to break all their hearts.    Frankly when I found out(my parents raised me to believe in Santa) it shocked me, but it wasn't like it traumatize me. She will be fine. Really you need to stay out of it. It isn't your child and it isn't your business.|`|VN2m6XHXaa	No, let them have some fun.  But here is the catch:  "She actually made a list of 10 things she wanted for Christmas and walked with me to put it in the post box."    Wanted and that is the problem. The list should have been things she would like, not wanted.
RCDDNUWgaa	okay so i had the same problem first of all your baby is going to favor one breast more than the other but the best thing to do is to start with say your right go for 5 to 10 minutes, switch breast and then finish, then the next time you feed start with the left breast for 5 to 10 minutes then switch and finish, this will keep your milk flowing regularly in each breast. a good way to keep track is to use a safety pin on your bra so you know which one you need to start on the next feeding. a baby gets most of the milk he is going to get out of one breast in the first 5 or 10 minutes anyways so this process can help keep it regular in both breast because starting on the same one each time is not a sufficient way of doing it. if you feel that you are starting to lose your milk you can also talk to your obgyn doctor and they can perscribe lactating pills to help you get it back or at least get the other one up to par. i understand how difficult it can be so hopefully this will help. also a lactishoner can offer helpful tips too.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I have this too. My daughter prefers my right nipple over my left and as a result I have way more milk in that boob than the lelft, and it's obious----it's bigger than my other boob, lol. You could try offering your right breast first to bring supply up and have him drink more from there, and roate which one you do first between feedings.
tTbDaqlJaa	You could try :-    - some over-cooked rice (so it's soft) with some chopped-up vegetables (broccoli, peas, mushrooms, sweetcorn etc)  - macaroni cheese and spinach? (might be too sloppy, I don't know)  - spaghetti and chopped up veg mixed with a tomato sauce     These are some of the things that my daughter liked when she was 10 months old.  I could suggest more if you like...    G.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Feed her what the family is having.  At 10 months our son ate what we ate less the salt and oil.  Favourites were ravioli, pasta, casseroles, stews, mild curries and stir-fry for dinner cut into appropriate sized pieces for your little one.  Toast, fruit fingers, pancakes or cereal for breakfast.      If your family has any allergies just avoid giving those foods to baby until the doctor gives the go ahead.  Feeding your baby what you eat means less work for you which is always a good thing.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	All the meals you prepare for the rest of the family, you can liquidize for the little one. Like vegetables, eggs, beans or fruits.    Enjoy the baby, they are very sweet on that age.|`|SRcWXkl5aa	my son has jus turned 10 months and he eats anything we do, cutting out salt though, we give him pasta, tuna, beans, fish, steak vegetables, anything but spicy stuff, but be careful on too lumpy foods keep them mashed a little but still allow a few lumps so they can get use to chewing, i hope this helps, don't be frightened to try her on new stuff,it will stop them being a fussy eater later on, my midwife recommended that they can eat anything we do so i followed her advice. hope this helps a little x
jaP0TANdaa	Well, anytime you have succesfully conceived and delivered a child and then have problems trying to conceive another it is considered secondary infertility (as you obviously were fertile at one point). Given her age, she may be having some premenopause symptoms that are making it more difficult to conceive. Nine years of trying is a rather long time though and it really is time to consult a doctor. Her chances of conceiving at her age decrease drastically each year, and most doctors will see you after six months of trying without success if you are past the age of 35. There are many treatments and other options available that could help you conceive. If you are not ready to consult a physician, I would definitely look into charting (using BBT, OPK's and cervical mucus) to help understand her cycle a little better, identify when she's ovulating (if she is, and if she's not... then there's your biggest problem) and increase your chances. There's TONS of information on the web about fertility charting and the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" is excellent. Good luck to you!
FncCxdu7aa	no, not usually, it could cause brakston hicks though, but contractions are Very very painfull. like the last person said Very little space. i wouldnt worry sence your getting induced tomarrow|`|bxlYleZkaa	No, it is just the baby getting himself turned round and ready. You will know when contractions start.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You would know if it was a contraction. :) It's just tighter because the baby is moving. There isn't that much room in there right about now. Contractions don't start with movement by the baby either. :)|`|x6IyESABaa	Actually when there is contractions, the baby movement will reduce.    These contractions may feel like menstrual cramps or a lower backache that comes and goes    http://americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth...
AA11795652	Well, since she's still pregnant and you didn't mention anything about spotting or bleeding or cramps, I think she's okay.  Definitely tell the doctor.  Good luck!|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	If she only took it 1 or 2 times she should be ok. Tylenol is safe during pregnancy. Hope all is good she just should not take it any more|`|1CryEnb3aa	Call her Ob/Gyn.  This is a question you need to ask them.  Good luck and hope all is well!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No!  Advil is the same as ibuprofen and should not be taken particularly in the last trimester.   Tylenol is the only doctor recommended pain reliever during pregnancy.|`|GqdC9Hx3aa	I was always told just to take Tylenol.    Don't panic, just call your Dr and let him know exactly what your wrote. OK|`|AA11763588	Only the DR can tell you if anything is wrong. Call them and let them know.     In the future only take Tylenol.
3IXDx9nhaa	My daughter climbed out of her cot at 18months old so for safety reasons I had no choice but to put her in a single bed the next day.  I bought a safety rail so she wouldn't roll out but could still get out the other end.  From the time she could crawl I put safety locks on kitchen, bathroom and laundry cupboards that contained possible dangerous things.  I also put safety covers on power points.  Also hang front and back door keys on hooks out of reach (even if they climb on a chair).  I also still to this day have a nightlight in the hallway in case someone needs the toilet or is sick through the night. Also leave her door open when you go to bed.  If you take these safe guards then you shouldn't have any worries. My daughter just turned 11 and I had no problems with her.  I also bought my daughter a new 'grown up girl' doona cover for her new bed.|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	my daughter was 1 when she went into her cot bed as a bed she stays in her bed even now until you fetch her the best thing i can say is try it you can always put it back on. sleep with your door and her door a jar with a night light in the hall way so she doesn't get scared, my daughter now comes into my room and wakes me up.  good luck|`|HyknHVV5aa	What I have done is reading her big girl bed stories for a few weeks, then  after a few weeks to a month of the big girl bed stories (buy a few books so it's not the same story every night), we switched her crib to the bed and seemed good with it, even saying "like book!" to us! I think you should try that, it worked for my girl! Even if she does get up in the night, it won't last long, plus the books will encourage staying in bed all night and sleeping the whole night unitl the sun comes up (or with books that don't say that you could add that line in at the end over every book).    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688155...    http://www.amazon.com/Big-Enough-Bed-Ran...    http://www.amazon.com/Barneys-Little-Les...    http://www.amazon.com/Your-Own-Big-Rita-...    http://www.amazon.com/Sophies-Big-Bed-To...|`|cTvP6j7Haa	When the crib gets too small and the kid can get in and out without much of a hassle.  Peace.|`|AA12133563	lol how cute.. she sounds adorable. lol@ "it's like giving a 16 year old a car" lol    I switched my son's to a toddler bed at 2.5 and decided it was too early. He can climb out now, and takes advantage of it.. it was no good. I would wait til 3.    Now he's 3.5 and has a real toddler bed because we'll be using the crib for the new baby. So we practically converted it to a toddler bed for 6 months and now it's already back to a crib.|`|XDf8xSyyaa	There's no particular sign of when to change them, it's up to the parents when it happens.  Whenever you switch over it's not going to be an easy time and you are going to have to perservere and not give in.  I think wat you should do is put the bed in her room so she gets used to having it there.  Talk to her about "moving to the big girls bed soon" and make it exciting for her. When it's time, the best way to switch her over is, when she is not around, remove the cot from her room and put it well out of sight - this is so she can see there is no other option.  Good luck!|`|afbkHAsaaa	I put my daughter into a bed when she was 18 months old. It all depends on the child.     My suggestion would be to try her in a bed and just explain to her how exciting it is to have a big girl bed. make her apart of the process of converting it from a crib into a bed, even little things like asking her to hand you the screws or something like that.     Basically just let her know that she is a big girl now and big girls sleep in big beds. If you have a baby monitor, perhaps use it for the first few weeks. That way you can hear is she happens to get out of bed.     Don't worry, I was a bit nervous when I put my little one in a toddler bed. But she did a lot better than I expected. It's only natural that she will climb in and out every now and then as it is a new thing for her. It gives them a little more freedom and they like it.    I think she is old enough to be in a bed by now. She might just be ready for a bed and you'll never know until you try it.    Hope it all goes well for you. Good luck!

NuZjVW6vaa	Get a mini tape recorder or anything that can record what the kids are saying. At least then she will have proof and then the teachers should be able to do something.   I feel for you, it is awful when your child is being picked on and nobody will do anything.  Good luck|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	teachers ALWAYS say " I never see it" How involved are they with their students ..if they never see anything?

If your daughter has names and they are harassing her they can do something. Go to the principal.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Well, you could go to the principal and have the children and the children's parents in, and you and your daughter in, but that could make the teasing worse once the adults are gone. If the teachers are not doing anything about it even if after speaking to them, you may want to consider switching schools. I know that may sound drastic, but the if the teasing is to do about race and religion it is a deeper issue then if the teasing was about clothes - you can change your clothes but you can't change your race and religion. But, good luck, you could start with the principle but be prepared for the teasing to get worse after your daughter "ratted" the other children out, but there always is the chance it could get better. If that doesn't work, I would consider a new school for your daughter for gr.10 to 12.|`|AA11742696	Tell the school to do something about or you will be filing a lawsuit.In the meantime..there are ways she can take classes at home on her computer.I think that might be a good idea at first at least she will be able to focus on her studies instead of fearing what is waiting her around every corner.Call a lawyer|`|xOr67VDiaa	kids can be so cruel, if you go to the headmaster it will only make things worse for your child, teach her to stand up for her self. its so important she gets the confidence to stand up for her rights. no one should be picked on, no matter what. she wont feel better until she works it out herself, i would ask her what do they say? and if its something like your fat, or something like that, tell her to think of something like well yeah your ugly, and give it back in a way that will make her feel better, and if she thinks of something funny to say back, the kids will laugh and she will walk away with her confidence. if she is getting bullied like hit and all that then you have to tell the mothers of the children to control their child. cos thats just not on.|`|AA11637178	Go to the principle and tell him of the station.

0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	I don't know if patronizing a child would be necessarily helpful.  Maybe that was a bad choice of words?  But showing a child "authority" is needed to establish boundaries.  Parents just need to do it in a reasonable way.  Be firm, but don't scream/yell.  Younger childer tend to pick up and imitate the behaviors of their parents.  So if they see you angry all the time, then that is most likely how they will start developing.    As far as the 2 TV shows you mentioned...never heard of them.  But my son is almost two and loves to watch the Nick Jr. tv shows.  He is still developing in his communication but we don't use that as a primary means of helping him to learn obviously.  But he does pick up on humor within the shows and laughs when he spots it.  He does understand different shapes, songs, colors when they are showing them.
0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	Umm...can you elaborate?
kNLi16C6aa	sounds like a really thoughtful gift. I think when you finish it is fine to send...    your friend will think the world of your gift, especially that you hand made it. And it's practical too.    we need more people in the world like you ;)|`|zqVx3Yfjaa	give it to her now|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	What a good idea I too have recently cought up with old friends... oddly also pregnant. I'm sure she will love them when ever you send them:)
eSOzKj0Waa	It really depends on how you are saying the name.    If you want the pronounciation to be Kee-ah-ra, then go with Kiara. If you want it to be Keer-rah, then go with Keira, Kiera or Kira. If you want it to be See-air-rah, then go with Sierra.    Personally, I like Kiara or Keira. Both are lovely names and have great pronounciations :) Good choice!!!    Hope this helps!! :)|`|bd3670d0e6f8740e2f3afab2d043a736aa	Kiera.......I before e except after c u know!|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Kiara or Keira.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i like keira the best  second choice would be kiera|`|GRoOEkNeaa	I like Kiara.    or Kiera.     That depends on how your pronouncing the name.|`|525243e90d7dd23ac229f228b24cac54aa	From your list, I like, Kiera or Keira the best.    Good luck! ;-)|`|a5VLn2cWaa	i like kiara|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Keira or Kira.|`|i6tyscumaa	it looks nice spelt keira  or spelt the irish wa, ciara  kara is a cute name aswell :)   congrats on your bby :D xx|`|MQjsspQ6aa	Keira  Congratulations hope all goes well and good luck!|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Kiara is pronounced differently to the rest, I think.   IT would be said "Kee-Ah-Ra", but the other ones would be "Kear-a" (as in 'rear')    I personally prefer the name Kiara because it can be shortened to Kia, which is adorable, but if you were after the second pronunciation, I like Kierra (though this could be "Kee-air-ah" as well).     Congratulations!|`|2hGZrGvGaa	It depends on how it's pronounced. If it's pronounced kee-are-uh, i would spell it kiara. If its pronounced keer-uh, i would spell it Kiera.  If it's pronounced keer-ruh, I would spell it Kierra.  Out of all of these, I like Kiera the best.  *Remember I before E except after C*    Oh yes, If it's pronounced see-air-uh I would def. spell it Ciara or Sierra, but I like Ciara better than Sierra.|`|IDmaxViIaa	kiara|`|SxbSb0zuaa	Keira or Kiera would be nice.|`|KLxoWHRZaa	kara|`|Q60i3HANaa	KEra  Keara  Ckeera|`|qkAqcEAhaa	Kiera|`|6BdI1xnPaa	CIARA is the correct way....it is actually an Irish name pronounced Keer-ah NOT SEE- air-ah    There are hundreds of people in Ireland called CIARA and none of them have problems with pronunciation|`|twzgqHlMaa	ever thought about dropping the 'a'?  My friend's name is Kier (keeh-air)  I always liked it growing up, maybe for it's lack of frills, I'm partial to names that don't end in vowels or y's .... they're just so common.|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	Keira is my favorite spelling. Good Luck and Best Wishes!|`|uB0QueSOaa	I LIKE KIARA|`|hSTNMnFPaa	I like Keira or Ciara.    Keira is best, to me, as a lot of uneducated people would pronounce Ciara "see-AIR-ah". Keira has a pretty clear pronunciation.    But gorgeous name, however you spell it! Good luck!  ? Q???|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Ciara (KEER ah)  is gorgeous, spelled the correct, Gaelic way. The rest look trashy.    [Edit] Ciara is NOT pronounced (SEE air ah).
vvpiYDqSaa	Kyra, Kira and Keera are other ways to spell Keira which is a lovely name.. so is Kiara. Just remember, it's you who has to say this name a million times.. so make sure you choose the one YOU like, not your family. :) Good Luck|`|YNdcFlulaa	How about Chloe?|`|F7tyzrMzaa	I love the name Kiara! Do you mean pronounced like Key-ah-rah    If so, that's a beautiful name! I know a Keira and she's an 13yr old who smokes and is pregnant. That's what I associate with that name.    Name your child what you like more, it doesn't matter about your family.|`|IDmaxViIaa	well i love the name kiara its so cute cause my friends name is it and she is really nice, smart and even funny all the time.|`|DePoXqSbaa	Well, if you want care-uh I suggest the original, clasic spelling of Ciara. But if you want kee-ah-ra then definatly Kiara, its cute looking to, but only if you want kee-ah-ra. Keira, in my opinioned is just an over-americanised version of the original, Ciara.|`|Q60i3HANaa	Ciara|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	What about Kyra?|`|xLmtXZJ0aa	Kirra  Kyra  Kerah  Kirah  Kiira  Keirah  Keira    I hope I helped!|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I prefer Keira (keer-uh).  If I had to do Kee-ah-ra, I'd spell it Ciara.|`|qBl07nnUaa	I like the spelling and pronounciation of Keira better. I think it's just easy on the eyes.|`|8x8kFP46aa	I like the pronunciation of Keer-a    You could spell it Kyra     Good Luck!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, this isn't a matter of spelling - they are two different names pronounced differently. Pick the one which you prefer.    If you want Kee-ah-ra, then it's normally spelt Ciara or Chiara (depending on whether you want the Irish or Italian version).|`|H7L66ynJaa	Kiara is good|`|VClxXNs3aa	depends how you are gonna pronounce it.    Keira I would pronounce kee-ra  Kiara I would pronounce Key-ara.....      JMO|`|IwvOKjfcaa	If you pronounce Kiara as i do (KEY-AH-RA)  then i like Kiara better.  Keira is more common.
z54nFnzNaa	lol, its ok. I feel like that also. Seems the men never get that feeling tho. I love my DH but he is never to tired to BD. A womans libido changes with her cycle, during our fertile times nature makes it so we want sex for reproduction purposes, other times of the month our homones are either lower or higher depending on the type of hormone. That has a  lot to do with how we feel sexually. Try not to think to much about it and tell him how you are feeling. You are allowed to say "no not tonight"Its ok to BD every other day. Best of luck|`|pLoD2hm3aa	awww ashley its very normal darling when ur ttc,its happening to me 2, men always want sex lol, its in there blood, but ttc is very hard and it puts stress on you and ur partner,i think ur just having a bad month, xx best of luck xx
E2UXN7J1aa	I apologize for saying this, but what a silly question. If there is a fire I am going to do what I can to get my child out immediately. As the first answer says, this isn't time for a learning experience.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Your 11 year old would need help reading "break glass and press button"???    It's a fire, not a fun learning experience. I'd have activated the alarm myself before the kid even got his request out. I certainly wouldn't be pratting about "giving instructions" on how best to hold a hammer or pull a handle.|`|eu6UQElYaa	In the event of a fire, I wouldn't bother with letting my 11 year old work out the learning process of pulling a fire alarm.  I would just break the damn glass myself and pull the alarm myself because even if my son and I are out of harms way, other people may not be.  There really isn't time in a fire to make it a learning experience.|`|EMKuBql8aa	If there was a fire going on, i would break the glass myself and pull the alarm as fast as I could because a fire isn't exactly a time for a learning experience, lifes can be at risk if the fire spreads.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Most 11 y/o's can read and break glass. No need to help.|`|AA10943329	And you're back. Is it school holidays or something. Damn Trolls|`|0rlGY8DXaa	if it's a real fire, i'm going to use anything i possibly can to break the glass, including my own noodle. teach him that instead.
mLUELEkFaa	I totally know what your going through. All my friends little sisters are getting pregnant now. None of them stay with there babies dads. It is very hard to deal with.My sister in law and I were going to try to get pregnant at the same time after I got married and it turned out she was pregnant at my wedding. Now she is a month away from her due date and I cant seem to conceive!  Just try to stay,  positive, it is very hard, and it is hard on your relationship too!! I had a nervous breakdown about it just last night, because another girl I went to school with got pregnant, and she is doing drugs as well... so it is very hard!  Try not to surround yourself with them that much. I know it is hard but you dont want to bring them down or lose your friends because of it.  Good Luck and baby dust to you|`|vi9VcVbjaa	I know how u feel 7 of my friends anr pregnant, I hear them talk about it all the time and they show there ultrasounds.. and my boyfriend and I are TTC for 2 months now and well it's getting to me knowing they have no problem getting pregnant and I'm having a hard time.. I was pregnant last christmas and misscaried, seem's like I can't even carry to full term makes me sad but I'm going to hang in there and pray my day comes soon, baby dust to u and I'll pray for u as well!  Good Luck my friend...|`|2a7ac6ae538e039a291aea992103dad8aa	I'm in the same shoes dear..i'll always tell myself...This is God's way of a test..but eventually He'll gimme the Best!! ..Just believe He's making a very special baby for us..and so its just taking Him sometime..|`|1ajBTe8raa	Hi Amy just wanted to wish you luck, i too understand only i'm not quite at your stage yet! i haven't even got the courage to speak to my other half about coming off contraception but i too am surrounded by mums to be or parents.  I'm very happy for them but also very envious of what they have. I'm sure you'll be in that position soon, just find all the courage to stay positive and furthermore enjoy your baby making practice, i truly believe that as soon as you relax and get rid of some of that anxiety that nature will take its course, wishing you the very very best keep smiling and enjoy your time together, will keep my fingers crossed for you both! good luck x|`|HclKftzAaa	Honey, i feel for you. I was TTC for 2 yrs before i finally got pregnant. My sister in law announced her pregnancy after i was trying for 16 months. They had been TTC for just 5 months! It was hard to deal with- i was SO happy for them, but devastated for us.     My friends are TTC at the moment too, and i worry about making them jealous etc. But i did my time, and i have every right to be over the moon about my baby.    I believe that we get pregnant when we're meant to. I finished my degree halfway through my pregnancy, and hubby's job is going better than ever. My parents have the time to spend time with the baby etc. You will get pregnant when you're meant to too.    How long have you been TTC? If it's a year, go to the docs. If it's only been a few months, then try not to fret. most couples take an average of 6 months. and only 80% of couples get pregnant within a year.     And just think of all the free baby stuff you'll score off all these ppl! they won't need it by the time your baby is born! Woot!|`|11wcVc0Eaa	It's just not the right time for you your time will come I used to  feel the same way all my friends were going on there second baby and i havent even had one now i have a 6 month old son whos the light of my life = ) god will bless you just be patient !!!
dba6798daedd01dcb233c8a115096ed5aa	Nah, don't worry. Dry semen is nothing to be alarmed about. They're usually dead by then so no worries. And if you had a condom on and he pulled out before he came, there's no way anything will happen.|`|bIyBUC88aa	Wow...I always wondered how trolls got pregnant!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. Dry semen is dead semen. Condom = no semen to get through. Relax.|`|VClxXNs3aa	aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...|`|jIQKc1dAaa	semen lives like 30 secons out in the air and a condom with no c*m=no way you're preggo
12c28f1e014ce89fc25267640bc651d6aa	The nestle's treasures have all kinds of different things....I forget what they all say,  but they have cute sayings on them and they work really well.  I also went to a baby shower recently and they put together a little package with flower seeds on a baby rattle paper and all you have to do is plant them.  They included baby breath...ect.  The company that you can find those is www.plantamemory.com.  They were a big hit.  Check those out.|`|aP4VQE2taa	Most people use  a small candy, like a Jordan almond or some type of little candy that's shaped like a pacifier or something that you can get for showers. These ideas are ok, but if you want to be a little more original, I would go for truffles, if they fit of course :)    I really like Harry and David ( if you have a store near you?) It's pretty inexpensive too. Also at Costco (again, I have no idea if you have one near you....) they have this huge double pack of the most AMAZING truffles for only like 10 bucks.    http://www.amazon.com/2-2-Pounds-Chocola...    Those are the same as the costco ones, only for about 10 bucks at costco you get TWO of those 2.2 lb boxes! Soo amazing and such a good deal.|`|AA12133563	there are these small containers of baby lotion, baby powder and baby shampoo that is only like 2" tall.. you can get them at walmart (they are the travel size).     My mom gave them away at my shower & I thought it was so cute. People can still use the lotions & stuff, so it's useful & cute.
OPhMTPqyaa	For one, A child should NEVER be unattended so if you take care of your child properly and don't leave her unattended then you shouldn't have a problem. My sister has a Siberian Husky and is the friendliest thing around her children. Crate train your dog so if you notice the dog is getting a bit excited or aggressive then put it in the crate so it will learn, Also put the dog in the crate at night time so you have no worries through the night.    Good luck and take care|`|H0fXySX9aa	your dog needs training hun no dog should automatically kill animals  i have a shih tzu rescue 2 kids and he is fine  get some training for Hun i have a friend with 6 huskies they are also packs animals not doing well on there own  the only way to solve this is discipline and training|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Consult a vet about it and tell them your concerns.  Baby comes first so if animal experts say your dog won't do well with a baby she's got to go.    Even with a nice dog you are not to let the dog be around the newborn without supervising.  Maybe keep the dog outside and build a shelter for him/her.  You could try having some professional training but if the dog is too aggressive when you bring the newborn home she might have to go.|`|082acc5d1aaab83d65363dc9cd5b96cbaa	we had a german shepherd and a great dane when we brought our new baby home, get your partner to bring home nappies and clothes your baby has had on in the hospital so your dog gets used to the smell before u bring baby home.Make sure puppy doesnt get to neglected when ur new arrival is home. Should be fine Puppy will get the idea that there is a new member to the pack. good luck.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Take her to see a trainer if you can. See if they can change her habits around smaller humans.

oHV95EFLaa	for me it would come and go but when i did feel sick i felt sick for hours! but its a different experience for everybody|`|VHHis05Naa	It depends on the woman.  I've never experienced regular morning sickness...  I had 24/7 sickness and threw up everything I ate and drank during both of my pregnancies.  Picture throwing up all day and night for months...that's what it was like for me.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Are you pregnant or just worried. If you aren't more than likely sweetie you were just sick with a 24 hour bug or you ate something funny. Morning sickness usually doesn't last just a day and comes usually around 5 or 6 weeks.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	From week 6 to week 14 I was nauseated 24/7 and puking what felt like constantly. It was complete hell and then one day POOF it just went away and never came back....thank God!|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	EVERYONE is different in this lol    for example you sound like your having morning sickness...    some women have one or two days in total  some have none  some have an hour a day  some have night sickness only  some have 24/7 sickness the whole time  just be glad your not one of those...cos i was and it was HORRIFIC i couldent wish it apon anyone|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i am 9 weeks pregnant and i gelt nauseous all day and then the next it would be fine.. today i felt nauseous at times and then it would go away.. so it depend on the baby|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Sometimes, it has a pattern.  Where the mother will feel like she is at death's door in the morning and, feel 'happy as a clam', after lunch.|`|bLluZIeTaa	yes i can come and go or it can stay it really just depends on you and the baby,good luck|`|e359abf8331cbdb544a5dc3305335a40aa	Everyone is different.  I threw up every morning about 9 ish like clock work with my first.  Didnt have it with second and my third every morning for three weeks as I was about to leave for work.  The smell of coffee set it off.      My niece was sick her entire pregnancy.      The best advice is stock up on saltines and breathmints.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	It's different for different people.  With mine, I would start to get real sick feeling and have to run to the bathroom, but afterward I would feel just fine, like normal.  Mine happened a lot at various times though the day.  I never really understood why it is called morning sickness because mine happened at any time of day.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Morning sickness can just come any time it like to. You can have morning sickness for the whole 9 months, not just in the morning for 3 months.  Are you pregnant?|`|VPCVswkpaa	Well i was sick the first 3 months the it went away and came back my last 3 months so it really depends on your body and your baby.
ii0C0tfXaa	It sounds like you want to end your pregnancy. Im not judgeing you, but im letting you know that you will most likely regret it, and that a baby is Not the end of the world, when you see that baby you will fall in love, get an ultrasound before you decide this. Please do not hurt a baby, just go to the doctor or family planning and discuss your options. If you are pregnant there are other options then taking pills, because chances are it will not terminate your pregnancy but it will just put an unborn baby in harms way, and cause a harder life for him or her, a pill may harm the baby, not kill it or terminate pregnancy. If you do this you will feel terrible. Woman get pregnant unplanned all the time and things turn out FINE. your not going to die if u have a baby, you could also consider adoption if its caring for the child that you are concerned about.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I love it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	First you don't want something that could harm your baby and now you do? Call a clinic and get some advice there.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Do you mean the birth control pill?|`|MqFeJiukaa	Are you trying to end a pregnancy?  Are you trying to take something for pain and want to know whats safe?  I am confused because of your 2 questions in a row.  Just tell us whats going on straight then you can get a straight answer.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Oh jeez.... well goodluck with that.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	ASPIRIN.  Yep, years ago that's what was prescribed to keep you from getting pregnant.   Place an aspirin between your knee's and never dop it. I promise you can not get pregnant with the aspirin there.|`|ENJ0bY48aa	If you are sexually active and don't want to get pregnant, talk to your gynecologist about birth control options.  If you are pregnant and aren't sure what you want to do, find a Planned Parenthood or see a doctor to discuss your options.|`|rev4lrn0aa	This is disturbing... are you trying to kill your baby??|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, try birth control, and if you mean as in you've had sex and you're scared that you might get preggers, then go to a walmart pharmacy and ask for the plan-b pills it costs about 54 dollars, but it works...although it has to be within 48 hours of intercourse...|`|bLluZIeTaa	if you are talking about birth control,i heard yaz is good,good luck|`|jIQKc1dAaa	that's called birth control dear. but do you mean abortion pill? Because theres one of those. Or the morning after pill? Theres that too. you're really not specific enough.
MEd22BHMaa	She needs to tell her Mom...asap. I don't know why 16 year olds are even having sex... They are wayyyyyyy too young to be taking on such a responsibility. She needs to talk to her MOM...NOW!!!!   They can figure out what to do from there.  Trust me... I am a Mom... and I would want my Daughter to come to me...if she were pregnant.   Let me know what happens...|`|1CryEnb3aa	You need to convince her to talk to her mother.  She needs medical attention.  She is young and will be considered high-risk.  If, she can't talk to a parent, what about a school counselor?   BTW- her mother will find out soon enough.  She won't be able to hide it for too long.  Good luck|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Tell your mom. Or post it on myspace.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Its really her responsibility to tell people.  You just need to be a friend and support her.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	They will find out soon enough.  She is gonna get big!|`|bLluZIeTaa	tell her parents should be the first thing and then get ready to have a baby she is really going to have to grow up fast,good luck|`|AA11762804	if she dose not want to tell anyone then that is up to her, you should stay out of it unless she is going to hurt herself, or go off and have an abortion becuse she is scared, other then that if she is not ready to tell then leave her alone, it will only make things worse and she wont be able to trust you|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Tell some one at the church, ask your mom or a teacher at school. Grownups are not that bad, they will help you if you asks.  Good luck.|`|SjYbkWdQaa	first of all, she needs to understand she in NOT alone. I have never been in situation, but started having sex at 17, ive had 2 pregnancie scares. YOU need to learn from this! condoms and Bith control pills are a must for teens who are planning on having sex. SECOND of all, she needs to get to planned parenthood for counseling and her options. she has, 3...telling her parents and being a good mother, adoption, and abortion....id go with an open adoption, she can have adults raise her baby, and still visit them. the sooner she tells her mom the better. if shes planning on keeping the baby she needs to especially tell her mom so she can get proper care, if she wants an abortion id go to planned parenthood before the weekend, theyre closed on weekends. abortions are usually free and ALWAYS confidential for teens.|`|4vDPfZA9aa	Convince her that she NEEDS to tell her mother. They will eventually find out anyways, she will get big! I think it would be better for her mom to know sooner than later, not only for the health of the baby, but for your friend as well.    A lot of times girls think that their parents will "kill them" if things like this happen. If they are good loving people, they will support her and help her, and of course they would be disappointed. Maybe if you were with her when she tells her parents it will relieve some of the pressure on her. I am a young mother too (20) and when I told my parents they were surprisingly understanding and supportive.    good luck to her|`|NhV6lDsBaa	try to convince her to talk to her mom, and if she is afraid, ask her to talk to a school Console....and the Console will talk to her mom, i think it would be better so that she wont put all her anger on her daughter, and the Console will calm her down.  and you should tell anyone, coz in few months she wont be able to hide it coz it will show, she will grow big...and i think her mom will notice, all you can do is support her, tell her that everything will be fine. but done tell anyone, let her do that.|`|qWMh5Bb1aa	I agree that you shouldn't tell anyone for her, but she really needs to get to a doctor for not only the baby's health, but her own. She can't get the medical attention she needs if she won't tell anyone, and if she's only 16 she'll need a parent involved. Tell her that you love her and will be there for her every step of the way. Also let her know that it's okay that she doesn't feel ready right now to tell her mom or parents, but that it's going to be hard no matter how long she waits, and this is really a pressing matter that goes beyond her nervousness; she could be in medical danger. She doesn't have to tell anyone else, but she does need to talk to a parent when she's ready so they can get to the doctor. The best thing you can do is be there for her and help her get her courage together, but don't tell anyone else. :)|`|jIQKc1dAaa	encourage her to tell her close friends and family. She needs them more than anything right now.|`|ii0C0tfXaa	Explain to her that it is not the end of the world, alot of young women get pregnant everyday. Do not go and tell anyone but just be there for her, and try to convince her to tell her mother or maybe an older aunt or cousin who she can trust, she needs medical attention because with her being young alot of risks can go along with that. Tell her that its better to tell now than wait till later. I found out i was pregnant about 4 months before i turned eighteen, i planned on NEVER telling my parents lol, i planned on waiting till i was 18 and getting big to tell them, but then i thought of the unborn baby in my belly and how bad i would feel if something that could have been prevented went wrong with him, so i told...my mom was a little upset and so was my dad, but they took me to the doctor, and now he is almost due and they are extremely excited!!! it wont be as terrible as she thinks it will be. Nothing is the end of the world!! You just have to live with the decisions you make, best of luck to you and her ...i hope you can get her to tell a trusted woman who can help her.|`|gM0RMviAaa	she needs to tell her mom dont make her mad by telling people just try to talk her in to telling|`|e359abf8331cbdb544a5dc3305335a40aa	Your friend may get mad but you need to tell someone.  Being pregnate at 16 is nightmare scary (experience)  but if she doesnt get the right medical attention for the baby and herself she could end up in a lot of trouble health wise.    Give her another chance to tell.  Help her make a plan and be with her.  If she is afraid to face parents alone help her find another adult that can help mediate the situation
aLkCxq5aaa	My signs were quite strange!!  My 1st pregnancy I noticed that my 2 tiny moles on my hands had gone, then just sort of realised my period was late.  Didn't have any other signs or symptoms and an easy pregnancy.    My second was planned so I was looking for the signs before I took the test.  5 days after intercourse I was having my normal weekend  glasses of red wine and was sick 3 times after 1 sip...then I knew something was up!!  I took a test the day before I should have and it came up negative so I thought that was that for that month, but later that evening my son, then 6, and I were cuddled up on the sofa and he pointed at my belly and said "there's a baby in there"!!  He didn't even know we were trying!  so that prompted me to take another test the next day and sure as anything it came up positive!!     I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and it was my son again who suggested there might be a baby in my belly again...spooky huh?!!  I hadn't even noticed I'd missed my period, but after he said that, I started noticing how tired I was, the sicky feelings when I was cooking in the evenings and I was warmer than usual.  And he was right yet again.|`|oCTG5IVvaa	i became convinced i was pregnant about a week and a half before my period was due..(my cycle was about 33 days) . my nipples were extremely sensitive first, then i started eating quite alot, then i felt really sluggish and constipated and lastly i got thrush...i never normally suffer all, especially all at the same time! tested 5 days before period was due and it said negative, then tested again day before it was due and came up positive straight away!  Oh, needless to say, my large appetite swiftly disappeared at 8 weeks when morning sickness kicked in, and still hasn't returned!|`|jNzSfH9Maa	NGARLY CRAMPS WORST THAN PERIOD CRAMPS|`|gM0RMviAaa	i knew because i was felling werid like a cold was coming so i went to my doc and she did blood work and called a week later and said i was and i already knew cuz of the way i was feeling|`|jIQKc1dAaa	You really can't tell you're pregnant before your missed period. People say they knew but for the most part you really can't tell. And if you do have "symptoms" they may be something else or in your head. Its really hard to tell. your best bet is to wait til a week after your missed period and take a test.  Hope this helped. :)|`|4hxgRpBIaa	I knew a week after we conceived. I just woke up and had this "feeling." I took a pregnancy test and it was a really week positive, but it WAS positive. A week later I went to my doctor and she confirmed it for me.  I really didn't have any pregnancy symptoms until a few weeks later after I had officially missed my period. ^_^ (Like nausea, slight cramping, food aversions, etc..)    So now I'm 16w1d and totally psyched!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	headaches, frequent urination, weird super sensitive nose, moody as heck, && sick to my stomach all hit me before my missed period.|`|VHHis05Naa	I had no signs before testing, but I got very early positives.  It wasn't long after that when the symptoms appeared, though.  The vomiting/nausea started very early both times.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I was in denial. I had been trying for a year and didn't think it had happened that month but I had ALL The classic symptoms. Extreme fatigue, frequent urination, headaches, slight cramping, slight nausea, tender breasts...I finally realized maybe we had gotten lucky 3 days before my missed period and tested positive. Go figure. :)|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	sure did!!    At time of implantation..(right after ovulation) i had cramps. sore boobs...    then othing for a week..  then in the week leading up to my period due date.. i crmaped like anything..and got sore boobs and was tired..and REALLY REALLY hungry    found out was preg the night my period was due|`|C4ibOR7Laa	6 days after i ovulated there was pink pots of blood in my underwear, i knew i was pregnant then, now 11weeks and 3 days|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Yes,,, my period has always been very very irregular (2-3 even more months)... The first thing that confused me is that I would wash my hair at night and in the morning it would be noticeably greasy... and then I began to feel a bit tired and ill (although I never had 'morning' sickness)... I began going to the toilet a bit more too of course which is a common sign of pregnancy...  I was meant to go to Canada so I decided to take a test to clarify whether I was pregnant - and it was positive - so now I'm staying in Australia for the rest of my life  ;o)|`|MqFeJiukaa	I always had a feeling because I would gag when I brushed my teeth.  When I was pregnant with my 1st I was a smoker and I couldn't stand to be around it because I would get sick (thank God because it made me quit).  I also got breast tenderness.  I always would wait until my period was a day late then test.  With this pregnancy I was breastfeeding so I didn't have a period.  I just started feeling really tired, and nauseous so I took a test and it was negative.  I waited another month and took another test and it was positive so I went to get an ultrasound and I found out I was already 12 weeks...the first test was wrong.|`|x6IyESABaa	I knew I was pregnant one week before my missed period. I got cramps, swollen breast, cravings and a hunch. I tried to take the urine test and was positive. It's different for everyone.    You can view my pregnancy blog at:  http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/|`|bLluZIeTaa	nope i just took 3 pregnancy test after i was one day late|`|CP1zxDLiaa	I had a gut feeling. I wasn't having any signs or anything, I just knew in my heart that I was getting my Christmas Wish, the day after Christmas, I took a pregnancy test and sure enough! My wish has so far come true! Now I just have to wait 7 more months to deliver my first baby! So exciting!|`|oHV95EFLaa	I had a feeling i was pregnant before i took a test because i just felt different, i just knew. My signs were fatigue and nausea|`|ii0C0tfXaa	I knew after i was pregnant for about a month lol, i had run out of birth control that i was on for a couple years, so i thought well maybe my periods are just going to come at a different time and my body had to get use to not having the pill....lol i felt dumb...also i thought i was very sick with something, and i would sleep ALL the time, also had really bad morning sickness(which i thought was the flu), smoke would make me sick, and for some reason i just had a feeling that i shouldnt drink at this bonfire, and i used to love going tanning, and for some reason i just didnt want to anymore (i guess u get instincts)   ...then LIGHTBULB*** hey i might be pregnant lol and took a test...sure enough i was...and now hes almost due :-)
wXUXe9wYaa	Nobody liked the name we gave our son but that didn't stop us.You name him what you want to name him and if you are really that concerned about the "vibes" the name has take a look at this site.  http://www.kabalarians.com/cfm/webanalys...  It's nothing you have to believe but for your curiosity check it out.|`|VHHis05Naa	And this is why I do not share my names with family.  I love Charles, nn Charlie.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Charlie is a great name, but Ever isn't so great. That's not really the issue here though. Your mother-in-law hates the name because it reminds her of a very sad time in her life. Are you sure you want to just go ahead and ignore those feelings? Maybe you could call him something similar like Charlie Evan instead? That's nice. :-)|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	I don't think you should change it. Just tell her it has nothng to do with that.|`|AA11091233	I' love the name Charlie Ever. Like everyone says...you have to name your baby what you like, not what other people think. It's only a middle name...if it was his first name...I might reconsider. My mom always was standoffish because my brother named his daughter Sophie and she hated that name. It seems weird someone would not like a child based on a name, but for some people, they can't seem to get over it.    Choose the name that chooses you. You will know for sure once he is born. I always like to think babies name themselves once they are born.    Best wishes!!!|`|uB0QueSOaa	i think that the name is great...but the ultimate choice is yours and your husband eventhough she is your mother in law you guys are a family and need to make decision with each other and not let other family change your mind|`|OHfZFR31aa	I like Charles but don't like the nickname Charlie. As for Ever, why did you choose the name? Does it have a special meaning for you? If so, then go for it.    Another reason why you shouldn't discuss your final name with friends or family members. To prevent arguements, it's always best to just say that you haven't decided yet.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I am in this same situation. We were seriously considering Vincent Sebastian and both our families hate it for multiple reasons. It's what we like and what we want to use though. I think you just have to be strong and stand your ground. This is your child and your decision. Don't let other people influence you.    BTW I do think it is a very nice name. Congrats and good luck!|`|GTwVNeHraa	Name him Charlie, it's not related to Ever.|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	You should name him what ever you want. No matter what name you pick someone will always have an issue with it..because they knew someone with that name that they didn't like, I went through the same thing and that's why I hated telling anyone names I had in mind. But if you must change it, how about Charlie Everett? But you should go with what you want.|`|lyNstiEZaa	well i recomment this dont ask some one like this questions i mean its up to u|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Listen to the grandmother.  She was being honest with you, as to her feelings.  Don't do anything that would cause her to withhold herself from your child.  Your child deserves the very best attention from the grandparents loving on him.    This is the very reason why 2 of my children's names were legally changed.    After their abusive father left, there was much sadness and resentment through our family.    My son was named for his father - he asked if we could remove that name and replace it with something else....he did.    My daughter's name was chosen by her father.  She even looked like him.  My resentment for that man welled up inside me to the point that I would cringe and not be able to touch my baby girl whenever I heard her name spoken.   I changed her name, and it became much easier for me to accept this child with the name I had given her.    Wisest thing we did for the kids.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	Bad vibe or not I would name your child what you want|`|Wnmg850Paa	WHen naming your baby you can't please everyone, especially your in-laws. Go with what you like. I feel they had their chance to name their children now it's your turn to name yours.|`|SVtZ4vUMaa	I had the same issue with the boys name we chose for our third child. We chose Mitchell and my mum hated it cos my brother had a girlfriend about 8 years ago with a son named Mitchell.  We decided to keep the name because we decided mum had an issue with the girlfriend not the baby.  However I can see your mother-in-laws point. I personally don't like the name Ever anyway.  You could try changing it too something that sounds similar so you still get the flow.  How about Charles/Charlie Evan.  In the end it is your baby and you have to go with what makes you happy and other people need to get over it|`|TSn6eczlaa	it's not worth it, name the kid whatever you want. it's your kid not hers.she'll just have to learn to get over it|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	name your kid what you want, your son will out-live your mother in law.|`|LgLpJxnwaa	Charlie is lovely.  and without knowing your family or reading abot your mother-in-law, i really dislike the name Ever.  i dont really see it as a name.|`|egAIuHQxaa	He is your child. Yeah, she might not like it but it is you and your husbands child. And you can name it whatever  you feel like naming him.|`|NEglsYQAaa	i don't have any baby's but when you bring up baby names someone always has something bad to say. if you like that name go for it its your child|`|cBLa6fUEaa	well if your family is superstitious then yes i would change middle name how about  Charlie/Charles Evan and if i can say name him Charlie it is very cute|`|Q60i3HANaa	because of 'vibes'? someone will always have something bad to say about any name you choose. get a backbone.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It sounds like the discharge you had may of been implantation bleeding.  In my first pregnancy the early symptoms that i had were nausea, yellowish, kind of thick discharge and fairly sore, heavy breasts.    The symptoms you've explained also relate to early pregnancy signs, but they are also PMS signs, this is why some woman get confused with PMS and pregnancy symptoms.  The brown discharge may of been old blood from the last period that the body is just getting rid of.    It took me 8 negatives until i finally got my positive, as it took my body 5 weeks to produce high hcg levels. I would test again in a few days, if still no result then have a blood test done at the doctors as they are more accurate and detect lower levels of hcg.  Also if you didn't find out till you were 3 months pregnant last time, there maybe a chance that your body takes longer to produce high hcg levels for a home kit to detect too.    Best of luck and i hope you get the answers you want xxx|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	Hi, well i never been preg so i dont know if i can help you too much.  I have been having cramping for the last couple of weeks with yellowish discharge, im due on tomorrow.  I have also had abdominal pain too last week but that seems to have gone now.  I  haven't had any brown discharge or sore breasts so i dont know what to think myself.  I would test in a couple of weeks when you know your period would probably have been etc, if you test too early you will just get a negative response.  Sounds like you could be pregnant but i would not get your hopes up until you get that positive result.    Good luck
dfSc0AbGaa	Probably not the smartest thing to do after you carved your name in his chest. Remember? He got mad about that, too!|`|1CryEnb3aa	I truly feel sorry for your husband.  Not only can he not trust you, he can't trust his father!  He can't even turn to him for guidance in this matter.  Your husband has probably lost two relationships in a blink of an eye. How sad.  He probably will have major trust issues for a very long time. What is this world coming to?|`|707gOCvbaa	You slept with your husbands father and you want forgiveness? Your husband will never forgive you. Save your husband the nightmare and divorce him. It's the kindest thing you could ever do for him. This is wrong no matter how you look at it.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	Lol. What should you do!? Get some morals first of all. Sleeping with a stranger is one thing...this...well this is another.    As for what to do about your husband I would say to start filing the divorce papers. This is just....unforgivable!|`|AA11944162	Im sorry but i really don't know what to say but i would suggest telling him what you really think and feel. Im not gonna lie to you but what you did was really super messed up and its gonna take time for him to heal from this. Like the saying goes "You can forgive but you can never forget". Hopefully you've learned a valuable lesson from this mistake.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	Ewwwww. I cant relate|`|HclKftzAaa	you said you and your husband had sex a few nights ago... after you found a letter from someone else in his pocket.    If he was cheating on you already, then he deserved to catch you with his dad.    (it must be the biting his nuts thing- turned him off eh?).|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	I hope your husband divorces you, that's disgusting.   Maybe he deserves better and you should have never been in the situation to begin with.      Sorry I have no empathy for you at all.|`|3ETIU4lDaa	He will never trust you again, with out trust you have NOTHING!! start packing. Sorry|`|c55ae57b61c57d89cbf7b455b0b8de02aa	A real Messsss!!! Its going to take a long time and letting things go past you without your ego interfering... Even then, this stain will never fade...|`|qlee4qekaa	You can forget about rebuilding your marriage, its over and you cant just put it all in a big mistake in your past!     Imagine if it was your husband and your mum????  You will never forgive him or even your mum right????    So why do you think he will even think about forgiving you??????    Think before you post silly questions like that!!!|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	You should pack up in the middle of the night or whenever  your husband is not around and get the hell out of dodge.  There can never be a marriage or relationship again.  You have screwed yourself right out of all of it.  Your husband has lost trust and respect for his father as well, the very least you can do is get out...and stay out.  You are done.  You have accomplished the unimaginable.  If I were your husband I would never want to see you again.   You cannot be trusted and neither  can your husband's father.  You are both crap.|`|gXzssLJ0aa	I for one do not understand how drinking leads to sex... I have been drunk.. and I know damn well that while it might take someone mentioning something before I remember it I do remember it. And I also know that I am fully aware of who a person is. Drunk or not it was a horriable thing to do and honestly your husband should leave your ***. & probably disown his father. So with that being said you best bet is to talk to him about it. Let him know what happened and go from there. What happens depends on his ability to forgive & his moral standards.....|`|AA11637178	First of all no one ever does anything drunk that they would not do sober!! People use being drunk as an excuse to do what they wanted to do all along. You have to talk to your husband. See if he can forgive you. If he can then you need to go to a shrink. You have to rebuild the trust that has been lost.
9CoTDEKVaa	Well, anytime you have sex you can get pregnant! Doesn't matter how long he was in you, even if you had unprotected sex for a minute, it only takes a minute to get pregnant! Be careful, and maybe consider going on birth control to help prevent pregnancy! Just remember, even if your on birth control to use protection because condoms do protect from STD's. Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pretty slim really.|`|5haXKcIuaa	slim to nothing becuase alot of the time u get pregnant from the sperm not the bodly fluids.|`|bLluZIeTaa	very low chance but there's always a possibility but i doubt you are pregnant,good luck|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	pre-come can get you pregnant. he wont know that he had this but he would have. pre-come contains sperms,and it only takes only 1 sperm to get you pregnant. you chances of getting pregnant are the same as anyone else who has unprotected sex. all you can do is take a test.  good luck.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	I think your safe, but never become to confidant in having unprotected sex, there is always a chance to conceive it you're having sex.    Good luck.|`|Q7ovix19aa	I thought women ovulated within a week of menses.  You aren't going by the "Vatican roulette" lie are you?  That's a scam to make sure you get pregnant.  It's exactly the opposite of what you should do to avoid pregnancy.  It's "birth control" to cause birth.    As noted by another, we release some sperm all along, but most is with ejaculation.|`|oHV95EFLaa	well it's always possible but very unlikely|`|UEDUvVxaaa	Very slim, but it doesn't hurt to get tested.
yTD84yFlaa	Yes that's normal.  It's just gravity, I have heard of some girls laying a certain way so it stays in, as an attempt to help get pregnant.|`|vi9VcVbjaa	The same thing happen's to me whenever my boyfriend and I make love and when he shoots in me then pulls out it sometimes stay's in or it comes out when he pulls out after, I don't know if it's normal or not... I also lay on my back and put a pillow under my hip's and my man holds my legs up for 20-30 min but sometimes I have to pee right after too and I'm not sure if it all comes out when I pee or not and if that would lower our chance of getting pregnant but one day it will happen I have faith... ttc for 2 months now. :-)  good luck!|`|AWdUdVD4aa	Yes you can still get pregnant even if some of it comes out but the general rule is to lie on your back with your hips propped up on a pillow for at least 30 minutes. For some reason with me, I always get the urge to pee when I know I'm not supposed to get up. Good luck and I hope you get your BFP soon.|`|5INu2kzdaa	of course therer is a chance they call it back flow...it doesn't mean all of it comes out tho
2b71edd9024d68495ab0bd6a1f3eccafaa	my doctor put me on days 5-9 and 50mg.. i start on the 5th.. soooo excited cant wait! my husband and i have been trying for  2 for about a year with no luck so we decided to get a little help. my doctor also told me that with his experiences that twins with clomid is 30%.. thats just what he has witnessed in his practice. so just a heads up that multiples is a big chance.|`|6XR6ajTraa	Usually your Dr will start you off on 25mg or 50, depending on the Dr and your situation. You take clomid during AF days are usually for 5 days in a row I told that night time taking the meds are suppose to lessen the side effects if you have any. Days are usuall 5-9 or 3-7 something like that. Have you spoken to your Dr about it yet. Some people say that the chances of twins or more is pretty low, then I've heard of all these women that have no twins in their family and they got twins or triplets. Dr says it's a low risk of multiples but I've heard different from women who have actually taken it. Everyone is different.|`|zgGMPz5eaa	My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 15 months.  I have had one ectopic and 2 miscarriages.  We are starting out with clomid with our next cycle which should be in about 1 week!  My doctor started me out at 50 mg to be taken on days 3-7 and also prescribed estrogen to be taken on days 8-12.  The estrogen is because clomid has a tendency to counteract estrogen and lower it.  I am also going to be on progesterone after we conceive.  We were told we do not have an infertility problem, but in our case it may be a "carrying issue".  So hopefully the hormones will boost my lining etc.  My doctor has used clomid extensively and has a very low rate of multiples or twins.  His percentage is about 3.  We are trying the 50 mg cycles for two months and if we do not conceive, my doctor will be upping the dosage to 100 mg on the third cycle.  I have also been really documenting and paying attention to what has been going on with my body.  I have learned a lot since we first started trying which has helped me in determining ovulation cycles and conception signs etc.  If clomid does no work, we will be undergoing an hsg test to further check tubes and uterus for scarring issues and genetic testing to see if we have a chromosomal defect.  I hope this information helps!|`|7ZPNSIspaa	Wow great question :) Well I was put on 50mg at first and found out I didn't ovulate so the doctor bumped me up to 100mg, I was to take clomid starting on day 4 of my period. I think being also on metformin helped us on the conception. Me and my husband had been trying to have a baby since November of 2008 and now we're expecting :) we're 15 months in and doing great. The doctors told me being on the metformin is helping a lot. I think the best advice I got from a doctor that aided me was "You know what they say to those who are trying to have a baby? Enjoy every minute of it!". Good luck hun :)
UUpsa35Daa	He won't adjust right away...he'll be in his normal schedule so that's the schedule you have to be in for a little bit. You can slowly adjust it to a knew schedule and he'll get with that one but then as soon as you go back home you'll have to do the same thing.|`|lGSUToFQaa	it will take him a while to adjust but he will|`|J6IOqzL0aa	try adjusting his last feed 15 minutes later every day. hopefully this will keep him in bed a little longer plus it will be dark later i the uk in the morning so it might trick him to sleeping longer|`|0VHolTVEaa	We went away when my son was 6 months but it only took a few days and that was loosing and gaining 3 hours. It will take a few days then he will get into his routine again
ii0C0tfXaa	Woman have been having babies before the blood tests were even invented. Before hospatiols were invented. I think that you need to talk to her and tell her to tell her midwife not to bring needles around her...they should have to respect her wishes unless her or the baby are at risk. Good luck...i was terrified of needles....i turned white and nearly passed out while getting my blood tests done fore pregnancy...but i think the key is you just have to relax when you panic thats what causes it to be a bad experience|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Even if she's having a drug free labor she may still need an IV of fluids...If it's what's MEDICALLY best for her she is going to need to bare down and deal with it. It's what's best for her and the baby.|`|bLluZIeTaa	no there want be any needles involved if she has a drug free labor unless she gets dehydrated and they have to give her an iv,or unless something goes wrong and she has to have a c section,good luck|`|SYrJiDKwaa	If she's having a 100% natural labor, there should be no reason for needles.  Unless there is a problem, in which case, she will be in so much pain, she won't even notice the needles.  But if they try to force them on her, tell absolutely not.|`|98WKYtfwaa	She won't get treated any differently because she didn't get any blood tests. They're not allowed to do that, so if any of them do then put in a complaint about them.    She will only be able to avoid needles in labour and delivery if she has a drug free one and there is no complications, with the epidural you're not allowed to eat or drink so you need a IV drip of fluids or if she was put into an emergency c-section she'd need to get an anasthetic.    I'm in the UK and they don't put a drip in you unless you've had some sort of pain relief that makes you nil by mouth.
q0JTN9QAaa	We used to give my son enfamil gental ease.  He did good on it but about 3 or 4 times a week we had to give him prune juice or prune baby food when he got bigger so you can try prune juice.|`|lGSUToFQaa	her little body is adjusting to the formula, it's okay, if it's been 2 days then worry, my son goes 3 and 4 days with out pooping now, the doctor says it's fine, and to give him water or prunes, as he's 6 months old, so it's normal, you can call your doc if it really worries you. have a great day|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	it takes the baby time to become used to the formula.  when i switched my son from similac advance to similac sensitive it took him a day or two to poop also.  im sure she is fine. as long as she goes once every three days- its normal.|`|9f751efea5e097481fd7c6bf7d4af274aa	Dont be worried, all is good. As long as she doesnt go for longer than a couple of days w/o doing it, she will be fine.   Otherwise, to make you feel better, call her Dr and ask. That is what they are there for.|`|AA11952283	You need to be careful switching her milk.My daughter is 10 weeks and she was on Similac Sensitive when I came home from the hospital.  She would poop  0 times a day.I was scared to death.And when she would burp it would come out her nose.So they switched her to the Soy formula and that's better, she now poops 2 to 3 times a day and she handles the Soy better.The other milk use to come out her nose when I would burp her it was bad.She still gets the breast milk but she's mainly bottled fed.|`|Vv9Kpv5oaa	usually breastfed babies dont poop much and changing formula can cause them not to poop for a day or two..i went to the dr with my daughter for the same reason and he said sometimes they can go a whole week without pooping when we carry them ...there intestines dont need to work and when there out the womb  the first week they poop little then the intestial tract start's absorbing everything usually in the 4-5 week of life and it cause's them not to poop, but its normal there intestine's will regulate in a week or two.
3JKe5lr8aa	Put her in her crib. Leave the room. When she cries, and she will, return and gently pat her and talk softly but do not pick her up. Leave when she calms down. Eventually, she will tire and fall asleep. You just have to repeat this more than one night until she gets used to sleeping by herself and finds a way to soothe herself. A baby that can soothe herself to sleep is a smart baby. Thumbsucking and handsucking are all perfectly normal and natural and are ways babies soothe themselves to sleep. You just have to let go and realize that this is better for her health and will help her down the road in her journey to independence in all aspects of life. She will learn to rely on herself. Sounds silly, but these simple lessons very early on do follow us. And when you are there patting her and talking softly, she will know that she can count on you to be there for her and you will help her move toward her independence.|`|XDf8xSyyaa	She won't sleep on her own because you've always had her next to you!!!  You need to persevere with her, put her in her cot and let her cry, it doesn't hurt them!  Go in at 5 minutes and soothe her in the cot but DONT pick her up.  She'll still cry.  Leave the room, then do this every 5 minutes.  She has to learn that you are not picking her up and putting her with you, she has to learn to sleep on her own.  If she is sleeping on her tummy, well, unfortunately some babies you can't budge - I would leave her on her tummy, some are stubborn and no matter what you do they end up back on their tummy.  Good luck, I hope it works out.|`|kR6hptDvaa	mmmm.............I think its neutral, baby's Between 2-5 months do like this.|`|o7bYWjy7aa	she may be attached to the safe comforting smell of you, have you tried putting one of your shirts under the sheet so she can smell you? for the rolling over you can get a baby positioner and that prevents them going on the sides and back and a tight swaddled blanket might help     good luck
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes there is a chance you may be pregnant.  My step mum had spotting the day her period was due, then it increased a little then went back to spotting.  First of all the doctors said that was her last period, but later into the pregnancy they realized they got it wrong and that it was actually implantation bleeding.    Your be able to take a pregnancy in a few days to see if you are pregnant, or have a blood test done at the doctors as these are more accurate and detect low levels that a home kit can't.    Best of luck xxx|`|C4ibOR7Laa	if its ever a clear flow of red blood then its not implantation bleeding  but some people do have a lighter or shorter period during pregnancy
vSAQqGa8aa	Why dont you go to Planned Parenthood? Just walk in say you need a pregnancy test, wait a couple hours to get seen and find out then.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I know for me some months my breasts get sore around the time I ovulate so it could be that. You may just be experiencing an odd cycle or two. It does happen. Stress can do crazy things to your body.|`|x6IyESABaa	Try taking a blood test to test for HCG. Some women have low HCG levels so regular urine test won't work.
3rda58OCaa	Yes, it is probably because of no longer being breastfed, but he will be fine just give it a week or so.  Maybe give him another item to comfort him to sleep, like a special blanket or stuffed toy.  Tell him he is a big boy now and there is no more milk in there, but he can have a cup with milk.  And since he is a big boy now he gets to sleep with ______ (whatever item you give him or maybe let him pick out something for himself as a reward for no longer breastfeeding).  Give him extra cuddles and kisses, he will be back to normal soon.  Good luck!
sGTYgJlfaa	yes its normal, especially if you have really bad morning sickness or it may not even be that you can also just loose your appetite I mean with me I didnt gain anything the first trimester but then again I didnt loose weight either but just check with your doctor just in case|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not really. You aren't very far along and you know that you are pregnant now so just eat like you would without being on a diet. Call and make your appointment with your doctor and go from there.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	i lost 30 pounds due to depression.|`|4WgsBvq1aa	no don't stress yourself out it is totally normal to lose weight within the first trimester its perfectly heathly, before you know it you'll be gaining wieght just as easily.  good luck.|`|x6IyESABaa	Do you have very bad morning sickness? Most of my friends actually lost weight in the 1st trimester. It's normal. Talk to your doctor if you are worried.
h3IjAuCgaa	Well i was 11 weeks when i has some bleeding although it was mucus like and pink in colour and went to a brownish color ,I went to the hospital they ran blood and did hormone levels and also did a ultra sound turns out im having twins ,But to be on the safe side id go get yourself cheaked out it could be normal but wouldnt you rather know ?|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Yes but I went to the hospital and requested a scan to make sure everything was ok. Luckily it was and we still don't know what cause the bleeding.    They signed me off work for 3 weeks and then the bleeding stopped a few days before my scan to see if I was ok to go back to work.    Go and get yourself checked out.    Better to be safe than sorry. x|`|x6IyESABaa	My friend and me had bleeding thru the 1st tri. Both of us are okay now. But it's better to see your doctor. I had bleeding and cramps in my 1st pregnancy and ended in m/c.|`|4hxgRpBIaa	I did in my first trimester... I was probably 7-9w when it began. It was lighter than my normal period, and also I had really light cramping. A lot of people go through it, so try not to worry too much! (I sure as hell did lol!)    Everything is going well now and I'm 16w1d ^_^
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I'm not too sure on what the chances of her trying to conceive naturally are if her tubes are blocked, because it means the egg will find it hard to travels down the tubes.  2nd IVF treatment will be more successful as they can make it work.    I am so sorry to hear of your losses, i recently lost my little boy at 34 weeks, he was stillborn :(  Best of luck and i wish you and your wife alot of luck.  xx
pMzq6B3paa	Try giving her a warm bath and wrapping her up in a soft warm blanket. Talk to her pediatrician and see if you can give her medicine... I used to put a couple drops of childrens tylenol in a small baby bottle with water and give that to my son when he was sick. But talk to her ped. To see if its safe for your baby since she only weeks old.|`|UAunAKdtaa	take her to the doc. so far so good but you dont wanna risk your baby, since she's so little to something as horrible as the whooping cough.  give her back massages, with laying on her belly should help her get the mucus out of her nose if she has any, then use the aspirator...but DO take her, even if she is feeding ok.  good luck|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	at 3 weeks old consult your babies doctor.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	wrap an alarm clock in a towel and place it near her head. the muffled ticking sound is comforting because it mimicks the mother's heartbeat in utero. then put on the tv to a deep male voice.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Your baby needs to be seen by a doctor asap.  A "barking" cough like that can be quite serious!!  Don't dilly-dally on Yahoo answers - go to the doctor or hospital!!!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	Could it be whooping cough?    Take her to a doctor, get them to check because it is bad.  If you have a swing, put her in that - i know when my son was upset i would put him in his swing and it calmed him right down.  The alarm clock is a great idea, it works well.|`|7DF3qLDraa	I would definately call the babie's doc... I don't know about a 3 week old but my baby just got his first bad cold and cough at 3 months and I was told to elevate the head of the mattress a little with a rolled up towel or blanket. It is also imparitive that you use a vaporizer. It's ok if their appetite goes down a little but you need to make sure that you are offering her more feedings a lot more frequently than usual so she doesn't get dehydrated. Make sure she still has plenty of wet diapers. I know it really sucks... just cuddle her.|`|FlhwA7WMaa	whopping cough is going aruond! take her into her pedi immedantly if it sounds like a barking seal!!!!       congestion in her nose  regular saline drops in the nose and suction suction suction.     a misty bathroom..   will help losin it up..|`|XDf8xSyyaa	You need to take her to the doctor, or if it's after hours where you are the ER.  You can not muck around and wait with a 3 week old baby.  The barking seal cough is a real concern to me, so take her some where to be seen asap!  Also, don't do ANY of the things suggested in these answers(misted bathrooms, alarm clocks) this is a 3 week old you are talking about, you need to consult a physician!!
Zg1ih6gcaa	You want some variation in a fetal heart rate.  Our hearts speed up or slow down depending on what we're doing.  Even as adults our hearts are constantly adjusting to what our body needs.  When your baby kicks, the heart rate will go up.  When he/she is sleeping, the heart rate will go down.      Doctors watch for no variation (a fetus who can't adjust) and too much variation as indicators of problems.  Moderate variation is good and normal.|`|bxlYleZkaa	for the same reasons that there are variations in yours.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I'm not sure why but that is how it works. Nothing to be concerned about. Only become alarmed when your doctor tells you to be. :)|`|x6IyESABaa	It depends on the baby. It's baby is active it's higher. When the baby is sleeping, it will be lower.|`|aYacThofaa	same thing with me theres still variation with mine and im 40 wks. i think its just if the babys moving or if he is startled by a sound a movement anything causes the heart beat to variate|`|xV0APOtaaa	Anything between 120 and 160 is considered healthy and normal. My daughter was usually around 150, but I there were times she was only around 125-130. Don't worry, everything is fine!!!
mx3gFmIKaa	Oh boy can I relate.  Suggest going to a pediatric neurologist.  I am just like this.  The 'little professor' syndrome of being an expert on material that is far and above age appropriate is known as asperger's syndrome.  He may have this, or only features of it (PDD.NOS).  I've got it.  It is part of the autistic spectrum.  The most well known aspie's that are alive are Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Stephen Spielberg, Woody Allen and there are many more.  Additionally he sounds gifted.  Aspergerians frequently have unusual interests, advanced vocabularies, and unusual word choices.  Additionally they learn without much effort, seemingly by osmosis.  The fields of science, any scientists, mathmatics, and computers have an exceptionally high level statistically of those with asperger's syndrome.  The problems that come with asperger's syndrome are an inability to relate to peers.  Where other 5 yr olds are picking up rocks, the aspie child is giving a lecture on metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rock types.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The kid sounds very intelligent to me.  You shouldn't be afraid of him talking about these things.  You should talk with him, give him your honest reactions, like 'yes, I think that's true.' or 'I never thought about it that way', or 'I don't think you know enough about that, but I like the way you think.'  Genuine feedback and reactions can help.    I don't believe in reincarnation.  I think he learned this stuff in -this- life.  He is obviously a very deep thinker, and this should be encouraged so long as it doesn't cause problems, for instance, cause him to be depressed or not be able to sleep.    I would feel very lucky to have a cousin like that.  I would enjoy talking to him.  Actually, I enjoy talking to children anyway, and five years old is a magical age, an age when a kid grows very quickly and surprises you with how fast he can learn.  So enjoy him and help him, encourage him, and be glad he's not just a dull, mentally lazy child with nothing on his mind.|`|6t76bgS3aa	doesn't sound normal to me, but i've always been kind of a dumbass.  shouldn't he be playing with toy cars or something?  maybe get him to do something outdoors.|`|Ps2tufsoaa	Sounds like you've got a genius on your hands.  Definitely not normal, but normal isn't necessarily better.  Let the kid talk about this stuff if he wants to, and make sure he has opportunities to learn what he wants, but don't try to single him out as some kind of freak.  It certainly doesn't sound like a "problem" to me.|`|AA10281397	I suggest taking him to the park (play with the other kids), get some toys and play games. Computers and philosophy at age 5?!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think its a bit to early. Ok maybe the computer is ok with learning games.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	It is not normal, but on the other hand it is not abnormal either.  There are geniuses about. He might be one of them.  Why stop (or cure) the kid, if he is happy, leave him be.  I wish my parents and teachers would have left me, than I might be working now at something interesting, (Like philosophy) and not be sitting at the PC answering Yahoo questions.  If you really worried take him to a University and have him tested for "genius" IQ. Please don't stop his growth.  Peace.|`|3M5pHPwuaa	It seems that your brother has a boy genius on his hands.. It would not be in his best interest for you to discourage him in any way.     You shouldn't be opposed to it.. If anything your brother (especially) and you should encourage it.. Who knows what he could become..... In whatever length of time.     And this....     "I want to know that whether his behaviour is normal or not? Why he is showing this kind of behaviour? Does he having some kind of problem in the brain, if yes, please be frank with me. Also, give me the suggestions about the cure."     These questions reflect your thought process on a daily basis. It is more concerning that you are asking these questions. It's not him that has a problem.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Many people are very surprised to learn how much very young children actually can/do understand.  If you've exposed him at all to some of these subjects there's a good chance that explains part of it.  Kids of five and six are also at a stage when they need to process the whole idea about death and dying.    My daughter was three when she was noticing how furniture parts formed different angles and lines.  My son was two when he began reading words and memorizing everyone in our family and extended family's birthday (and he retained those dates, although he did say, "Nomember" instead of "November"  :)  ).  All three of my kids spoke about spirituality in very deep terms as young as three.      The point is, kids are very bright.  Some kids are super bright.  The only possible reason anyone should have any concerns might be if this child otherwise doesn't seem to "act right" (in other words, if he at all shows signs of being Autistic).  If he relates well to people, shows normal signs of attachment, hugs people, makes lots of eye contact, etc., chances are he's just a smart kid (maybe a highly gifted kid).      If he only talks to you about this stuff, and if it's only a few time a week; I tend to suspect you're just someone who doesn't know five-year-olds very well - especially very bright ones.  (Another example:  My two year old used to play a game where he'd say, "I'm a prime minister" and I'd say, "Well, I'm a president."  He would then come back with another "high" position, such as, "Well, I'm a duke."  He not only knew the titles of "high positions", but he knew to categorize them as he did.  Kids who gets lots of attention, lots of talk from adults, and are generally healthy can be pretty, pretty, smart.
x6xOlJfmaa	Just go to sleep take the test first thing when you wake up that is all you need to do.  You need to take the test with your first urination from your fasting rest.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you haven't urinated in the last 4 hours test now! First morning urine is best only because you don't pee at night which allows for the hormone to build up in your urine. If you wait at least 4 hours it's the same thing.|`|77CjF9tkaa	Take it now. The point in waiting until the first morning urine is so that your hormones are strong. If you are that late due to pregnancy they should show up!!! :] good luck|`|v657x02eaa	just take the test you already late so if you are pregnant then it will sho up now.

JxVx0GXiaa	it doesn't matter when your period ends, what matters is what date it starts, and what date the next period starts.  if you know how many days are between the first day of your periods (for example 28 days) - you will know that you OVULATE 14 days BEFORE your next period is due.  therefore, if you have a perfect 28 day cycle, you will ovulate on day 14. OR if you have, say, a 30 day cycle, you will ovulate on day 16... get what i mean?|`|eeBBtPA6aa	Go by an ovulation kit at the store.|`|MLyClT2Uaa	Check out this website, it gives you a good estimate of when you will begin to ovulate     http://www.babycentre.co.uk/tools/ovu/|`|xBW4saqgaa	when you find creamy white semi solid stuff coming out then you should know that you are very fertile.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	from the first day of your period count that as day one.  u should ovulate on day 14

Food cravings. Yes, it's a clich, but food cravings sometimes can be a sign of pregnancy. Don't rely on them as a sure symptom (it may be all in your head, or even a sign that your body is low on a particular nutrient), but if cravings are accompanied by some of the other symptoms on this list, start counting the days from your last period.     2. Darkening of your areolas. If the skin around your nipples gets darker, you may have successfully conceived, though this may also signal a hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.     3. Implantation bleeding or cramping. 3. About eight days after ovulation, you may experience implantation spotting, a slight staining of a pink or brown colour, as well as some cramping. This is caused by the egg burrowing into the endometrial lining. You might also see some spotting around the time you expect your period.     4. Frequent urination. Once the embryo implants and begins producing the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), you may find yourself going to the bathroom more often.     5. Fatigue. Feeling tired? No, make that exhausted. High levels of the hormone progesterone can make you feel as if you've run a marathon when all you've done is put in a day at the office. Fatigue is a hallmark of early pregnancy, though probably not a surefire symptom on its own.     6. Tender, swollen breasts. If you're pregnant, your breasts will probably become increasingly tender to the touch, similar to the way they feel before your period, only more so. Once your body grows accustomed to the hormone surge, the pain will subside.     7. Altered sense of taste. You may notice that your sense of taste changes. Some women say they have a metallic taste in their mouth, others that they cannot stand the taste of coffee, tea, or a food they usually like.     8. Morning sickness. If you're lucky, morning sickness won't hit you until a few weeks after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But as early as a couple of days following conception, you may begin feeling nauseated and queasy. And not just in the morning, either -- pregnancy-related nausea can be a problem morning, noon, or night.     9. A missed period. If you're usually pretty regular and your period is late, it's worth trying a pregnancy test. A missed period is the surest sign of pregnancy in a woman of childbearing age who usually has regular periods.     And finally...     10. A positive home pregnancy test    Lots of luck x|`|0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	The only way to be sure if you are pregnant is by taking a test.

I was ready to change things in my life because of my daughter I love her so much i went to my doctor to find out what I could do to stop because just like your husband I don't have much willpower either. The doctor gave told me about CHANTIX its a way to stop smoking.  It's a medication that has no nicotine in it so it's safe to smoke in the beginning have him set a day to quit after he starts taking it and stick to it. I haven't picked a cigarette since I made it to that day.  Yes it's hard but not as hard as cold turkey.  If he loves you and the kids he'll at least try.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	I know that cigarettes are basically cancer sticks but why would you tell a man who was a NON-smoker that you hate smoking? what was the reason for that? Maybe he's just doing that to bug you...    ETA: okay, you knew he was once a smoker and you got with him, people who once smoked have a good chance of starting again, it's addictive. Nagging him is just going to make him want to do it more, he needs to figure out that it's bad for him on his own terms. He isn't endangering you or the children by smoking around you, clothes can be washed. You are the dumb/selfish one taking 2 children away from a loving father because of something so small that you knew from the beginning.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	You are obsessed with smoking, apparently, and yes, it is harmful, but certainly not the death sentence that you are sure it is. And secondhand smoke fears are way overblown, else there would have been no survivors from previous genera|`|AA10413046	Well, nagging him is not going to get the job done.  Your his wife not his mother.  As long as he doesn't smoke around the children you are going to have to deal with it.    I would imagine your hormones are sending you over the edge on this.  Perhaps he could help by perhaps changing his clothes before he comes home and brushing his teeth.  Something.  Not every one who smokes dies of cancer.  I've known many smokers and only know one who died of cancer.  Congratulations on your new baby.|`|8e5bIYjJaa	My partner just quit 3 weeks ago and the arguments still haven't stopped! When we found out I was pregnant we agreed that he would have stopped smoking before our son was born....well, 5 months after our son was born he was still smoking!!    Aghh it makes me so mad! He finally decided to quit, but every single day he comments about it....."I loved smoking, I miss it so much" or "I wasn't ready to quit, you forced me to"...or..."my work colleagues tell me to start smoking again cause I am so cranky"..."Man, I really need a cigarette"...or..."this beer just doesn't taste the same".....BLAH BLAH BLAH    Why can't he just take responsibilty for his own actions and be a man! I really feel sorry for you, trust me, it won't be easy. It is something he has to do for himself, but try and support as much as you can and get him to try a couple of different options (patches, inhalers, etc etc)|`|XWQ6Wpv3aa	You're kind of being selfish for not letting him do what he wants with HIS life. As long as he doesn't do it in front of your children I personally think is fine. My dad has always smoked, and up until a couple of months ago, I have never seen him do it. (He hid that from me and my brother for about 10 years)|`|sw2R5A9iaa	odd that you hadn't noticed or cared about the smoking prior or during conception.|`|7wUfnIITaa	i don't see the big deal sure he risking his life but he respects you and the children enough to do it out side|`|1YdeUn1Caa	I'm sorry, but you can't tell me you couldn't tell he wasn't a smoker before you married him. I think you did know, but chose to ignore it. Now you got him reeled in, and you want him to change into what you want.  Sorry, don't work that way.  My father smoked 3 packs a day around my sister and I, plus we had 3 grandparents smoke around us too. We turned out normal healthy kids. Don't listen to the lab rats or the non smokers. They're just paranoid.  How dumb can a person be? You tell us. You're the one who married a smoker.
JQZDCcyQaa	I truly believe that either that person did not have children or really did sleep like a baby and the meaning of it got mixed up    Bradens mummy- I wish my daughter did that!!|`|sAAnquoTaa	Hahahahahaha!!!! Soooooo true!|`|zwctZ812aa	Lol it has always seemed kind of ironic because babies don't sleep for long periods of time, but I think they're referring to how soundly they sleep.  I don't know about your baby, but when mine is out, he's OUT.  You can get him in and out of the carseat, pick him up, pass him around, have loud conversations, turn the music up loud, anything really, and he sleeps through all of it.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Well, I never actually thought about that until now! Very good point!|`|3hkCIu78aa	True statement|`|AQn5sTXraa	It's strange, but newborns do sleep a lot. Maybe they meant amount of sleep? It does seem like a silly saying.

AA12091210	Hi there.  I am 35 weeks pregnant with my first, and currently being monitored very closely for pre-eclampsia.    Dizziness, headaches and seeing stars are all signs of pre-eclampsia.  You should go to the hospital and get checked out, especially since you have high blood pressure and a history of pre-eclampsia.    How are your feet, hands and face looking?  It is possible that you have gained the excessive weight because of oedema/water retention which, again, is one of the main pre-eclampsia symptoms.  You should also have your urine tested for excessive protein.  Surely this is something your doctors have been monitoring at each antenatal visit?    28 weeks is pretty early to be showing signs, because pre-eclampsia does usually set in during late pregnancy, but my doctors have been monitoring me since 22 weeks, so it is never too soon!    If I was you - I would go straight to the hospital and get checked out.  I have been admitted twice for 24-hour observations of BP and protein testing.  As you know, it is a very serious condition that can creep up on your without you knowing.  For your sake, and for that of your baby, please go and get checked out.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	I think it's normal I get those symptoms -the gain weight *25 weeks* Due may 8th :)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	They could be signs. The headaches/seeing spots is definitely not good. Go check out your blood pressure! I would call the OB if I were you. Better safe than sorry. :)    I had similar symptoms like migraines and blurry vision and so far I don't have preeclampsia, I hope the same goes for you! Turns out I'm just getting some bad headaches.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	weight gain usually is not a sign of it. But excessive thirst, constant need to urinate but nothing comes out is, protein in the urine, blurred vision, or other vision changes, numbness or pain in the right shoulder area. and or course high blood pressure.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	If those headaches your getting come and go, and they go away with tylenol, then those are normal pregnancy headaches.  Preeclampsia headaches will not go away with tylenol and the headache will stay with you.  When you get up too fast the stars or any dizziness you may have could be from the extra blood flow your body is processing for the baby.  30 lbs by 28 weeks is NOT a lot.  Thats abotu normal.  If you gain 2-5lbs within a few days to a week then I would worry about it being a symptom.  Everything your describing is normal, but if your truly worried I would most definately call the hospital and talk to the nurse on duty.  If you really think something is wrong then it doesnt hurt to have it checked out.|`|ZCTh21QCaa	The weight gain is only a sign if it is sudden weight gain because of extreme fluid retention. I had preeclampsia with my first and my legs swelled up to twice their size within a few days. I had to buy bigger shoes just so it didn't hurt to walk.|`|SRIaRm08aa	Preeclampsia has to do with increased blood pressure.  The only way you would have preeclampsia is if your blood pressure is high.  Symptoms of preeclamsia can be seeing spots, & dizziness. However, this does not mean that you have it. You should discuss your concerns with your obgyn.  As always, if you feel that there is a serious problem then call the ER and speak with a doctor or make a visit to the Emergency room to make sure that everything is okay.  Better safe than sorry.|`|lwtBaL1yaa	I doubt that you are pre-eclamptic at this point, but it is something I would suggest watching and making sure your doctor is aware of. Chances are the stars you are seeing is because of hormones, balance and fluid that often go crazy during pregnancy. During my last pregnancy I also had terrible headaches but they were due to a lack ofcaffeinee andexercisee. I noticed that if I stayed down, watching television for most of the day, I'd get a headache.     There are two major symptoms that indicate preeclampsia - high blood pressure andproteinn in the urine. Both of these should be checked at each and every OB appointment. Ask if they foundproteinn at your next and subsequent  appointments - that way you can be prepared.
YrK7S8xtaa	In Australia they usually say six months but out of all my four kids i have only had one that was able to use it at this age.    I usually just keep trying to give it to them from around six months but i don't force it on them and when they are ready they learn to drink from it and then i phase out the bottle.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I think most people start offering their baby a "sippy cup" to try a little while before their first birthday.  If not a sippy cup, sometimes babies like to "sample" drinking a small amount from something like a paper Dixie cup a couple/few months before turning one.  (If they're teething the paper cup won't bother their gums the way a hard cup would.)    If they get to practice here and there with small amounts of drink, they just kind of naturally start drinking things like water and fruit juice from cups (even if they have a bottle for a while longer).|`|CxQ3XW4eaa	When you think they are ready, i dont think there is any correct answer or age.  My son was around 9 months I think although its hard to remember, my Nieces are 2 and 18 months and both drinking from normal cups although its always best to have a lid on just incase!|`|zjuMrDmGaa	That sort of mess is why they invented sippy cups. When a child is ready for beverages other than formula (around one year or so) and shows an interest in your cup...it's time for their own cup.|`|547Ln6rNaa	There's no right time, you have to do it when you think your own child is ready. We gave our son sippy cups at two, he would not hold one though, so we held and tipped them for him - kids can be odd sometimes. He's six now, and while I give him an ordinary glass when he is sitting eating, or if we're out, I still give him a beaker with a concaved lid and a small hole in the top if he is somewhere a spill would be a disaster (like using the computer), so if it gets knocked over, it spills slowly!    In bed at night, if he asks for some water, I still give him the sippy cups (with the spout with the hole).     If your child overtips, perhaps try the beakers with the concaved lids and the hole, at least then they get to feel the spill and correct the cups position before they are soaked. But there's nothing wrong with keeping sippy cups, no one ever got emotional problems from having a sippy cup too long. Just don't let them suck on it and make a problem with their teeth.|`|YREWfq2Baa	whenever they start reaching for your cup...Good Luck!|`|irLnPW4aaa	Try a cup with a cover and a straw.    I taught my children to use a straw when they were about 9 months old and they had no problems.  Once she gets used to it, you can take the cover off.  Then after a while, get rid of the straw.|`|O6uxP6GQaa	well my DD is 13 mo she has plastic sipper cups, i'm not sure if this is what they are reffering to at the age of 6months??? i give her a glass sometimes while i'm holding it but other than that i think she will be a while off drinking from a cup yet.    You could check out www.bumpsandbeyond.friendhood.net and the mums there could have some great advice for you. Its a great place to meet new mums, mums to be and TTC. So come on over and say hello and i'm sure there will be someone there that can help out    Luv Sair  www.bumpsandbeyond.friendhood.net|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	a sippy cup should start being offered at 6 months and they should be able to drink out of a normal cup by about 18 months.  There will of course be occasional accidents lol
2l8AsMlFaa	Maybe they want you to handle these problems for yourself.  You can't  always depend on your parents to come to the rescue when you get in  a skirmish.  You need to handle some things for yourself, if you don't  want your sister and her friends going into your room, ask your parents  if you can put a lock on your bedroom door.  Good-luck!!|`|AA11637178	Your sister and her friends are curious about boys that is why they spy. They think it would help you in the long run to learn to talk to people and learn to work through problems. They are wrong for not to talk to your sister about respecting your privacy. You might want to put a lock on your bed room door. First let your parents what you want to do. You might want to sit down and talk to your parents about how this makes you feel. Don't do it when your upset.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	A lot of parents don't take their kids' "issues" very seriously.  They aren't bad parents.  They just don't (most likely) remember (or know) what it's like to have something like that going on.    If they told you to handle it, I think you ought to go to WalMart and buy yourself a new doorknob with a lock for your closet and for your bedroom.  (Or else ask them to buy them and you can change the door knobs.)   Just make sure you measure the distance from the edge of the door to the center of the hole where the doorknob goes.  They generally only come in a couple of sizes.  You could actually take out the ones that are there now, and look at what size they are.  It's usually imprinted right in the metal.|`|mpc6aNvCaa	have u asked the girls to stop it, if so and it's still going on buy a lock get 2 keys one for u and make sure u put the other one up in case something happens and not where the girls can find it. the sister's friend s probably like u and just want to be noticed by u or they are plainly bored as a mom my boys to do this and my oldest will be talking to a girl outside and my daughter will go out and yell at the poor girl saying that's my brother he's mine. oldest is 15yrs daughter is 7yrs old. is a sibling thing not wanting them to get hurt.  good luck|`|2hbPtlVmaa	if shes younqer than you.. handle it. put a lock on your door.  if shes older than you... shes a lil messed up in the head and so are your parents for lettinq it qo on....  im quessinq she is younqer, and her friends probably think you are hot so they ask her if they can spy on you. yeah. thats probably it, but seriously....    |`|1TKfwDGsaa	I'm alotting 3 sympathy points to you for these hard times.|`|NJrsrT12aa	well they can't just ban her friends from their house because little kids tend to spy for some reason. you're not alone, don't worry.    your sister has to be pretty young to be doing this.    did you try confronting her?    or have your parents say something and the next time she does it, have them ground her.      or put something really scary or something she hates in your closet so she doesn't want to go in there.|`|HhQtrjQGaa	Next time your sister has friends over...scare the crap out of them. Draw on them in permanent ink while they sleep or something. Draw on your sister when she sleeps. Put pictures of naked girls or something in your closet...or a spider in a cage. So that when they go to go in their...they will scream and run away. If your parents yell at you. Tell them     "You told me to handle it myself...so I did" and then smile innocently        :)|`|e8yt5PrGaa	not bad parents bro just irresponsible ...    but i think you should handle it ..    when you go in to youre room . get a water gun and when they invade youre space ...shoot them ..|`|edImOGbLaa	no they arent bad parents they are just telling you to fix your own problems because you will have face problems far worse than this in life.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	How old is your sister? Because they can't just ban her for spying if she is young. I would lock your door to your room.|`|Fg5AWkIYaa	Wait in the closet for them and whwn they open the door scare them?|`|45nSn7Rcaa	In a way I think they are doing the wrong thing, but maybe they are trying to get you to learn to handle situations on your own and that IS good parenting.|`|2jMFurDoaa	its aggravating! i know what your going thru lol! when i lived at home....OMG!     parents choose there battles sometimes, maybe they have bigger problems. there not going to ban her friends. maybe they have little crushes on you!    the next time there in your room pick them up by there shoulders and carry them to another part of the house. or just ignore them act like you cant hear or see them. it worked for me, when they cant get a rise out of you they lose intrest.    put a lock on it and lock them in. they'll stop!|`|K87vKkA8aa	Your parents are horrible, BUT there is a good side to this you can use there words, twist them ""take it in to your own hands"" and do whatever you like to them ;)|`|Um9rR3PUaa	put a lock on it plain and simple|`|OMs8tKlJaa	is your sister around the same age as you? her friends probobly like you haha|`|24mXv9Claa	umm idk maybe your parents want you to handle this so you can do stuff on your own when you move out. if they do it more talk to your sister and tell her she should be invading your space. Or stuff your closet with clothes! or random stuff so they cant fit in it! :P haha idk i hope i helped :) & good luck ....  you could also pretend your not home and hide in the closet yourself haha idk :P.. or spy on them in there room they will evertually egt anoyed and stop  how old are you? and your sister? btw? it would help more
rVs2nfgGaa	she is totally pregnant! sometimes pregnancy tests come up false because they aren't always right on a blood test to see the hormone level will indicate for sure that she is pregnant but dang if she isn't and she has all those symptoms then wow! congrats to her for becoming a mom. I would have her wait until like 5 or 6 days before her missed period so she doesn't waste twenty dollars on it.|`|EO4tgt1saa	GO TO THE FREAKING DOCTOR!!!!!|`|xOr67VDiaa	if she isnt pregnant, then i would hate to think of what it was. see a doctor asap and keep your updates regular.|`|ehmeG65gaa	those tests can be inacurate anyway, she needs to go to the doctor and have a blood test. It is important for her health and the baby's to get prenatal care.|`|bYoGeKUUaa	that thats you.|`|diAqosiIaa	why doesnt she just go to the doc|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	If you get another false, she still needs to see a doctor.  the symptoms are obviously severe and abnormal.  good luck!  i hope everything is alright
55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Hi !  Yes, you could go anytime and you could be a week or two away but...watch for  your stomach to get hard as a rock...you will have the baby within 24 hours of that time.

Congratulations!|`|jQDeTTVhaa	YOu never know it works for some but not all.Good luck to you I am due today and I feel no pain whatsoever.I have a doctors apt which she is gonna give me my induced date and time.I hope you have your little one soon.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Absolutly you could be.  Did she break the membranes?  This is a form of inducing labor.  Did she tell you she was going to induce?    Some women get to 4 or 5 cm before they even go to the hospital, so there's no gaurentee.  But I went when I was only 1cm because my water broke.  So it honestly just depends.    Good luck!  I was having terrible contractions at 2, so if you're still at home and doing well then that's awsome!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	have ur bags packed|`|uunQVSGFaa	awwww congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!  boy or girl?  good luck  best wishes|`|JlbxqSM6aa	it won't be much longer.best of luck by the way and congratulations|`|X1ACfL8eaa	I hope so! Your so lucky. I'm a little jealous! :)    Congratulations!|`|QT5ROElraa	wow! good luck! I am 40+ weeks and WISHING I could get this over with. I had a membrane sweep yesterday, and am having lots of contractions now, but they are not evenly timed... I am so tired of the false labor... Wishing you the best!
ySKK7lCyaa	It's not bad but weird.   I would stop holding his hand and just start hanging out with my friends more. Try to hook one of your friends up with him. And find your self a boyfriend.|`|aeiP74PLaa	slip saltpeter in his cola maybe idk how 2 make a girl stop bein h*rny maybe put a cold rag down *ahem* there|`|Tebw0VOdaa	I honestly think you should stop the attraction at all costs! If you pursue a relationship and it does not work out he will still be your step brother... that would be awkward!|`|k1cDEnLPaa	if you guys pursue it and things don't work out (which is possible, because you are young), it will ruin your parents marriage because you and him wont be able to get along. just find another guy at school.|`|S3t69kh2aa	Don't do this.  Talk to your mom and dad about it asap.  I mean it!|`|gbX2aTu0aa	That's cute.  Your not really related.  It's okay but talk to your parents first...    Remember Gossip Girl?|`|4WgsBvq1aa	non of the characters in twilight are step siblings. Everyone in that book is born from different parents but lol. but to your question i think you should talk to your parent about it and see what they say.  If you are young like below the age of 16 i wouldnt pursue it further but i know a friend who is dating her step brother and they live and go to school together, which seems weird but if thats what you want then go for it. Good luck.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	This is quite common.  Play it safe without a real commitment at first and if both feel the same in a year's time, make it public.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	you guys aren't even blood related, so i don't see why its bad.|`|HOdblqIkaa	your legally in the same family so your gonna have to do whatever you can to suppress any attraction you have towards each other. im sure after living with him and seeing what its like to live with your crush, itll fade fast.|`|I2e4LFF9aa	I dont know what Twilight is. but you guys are not related. So, go at it. its not bad.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	you need to STOP!!!  it doesn't matter if you're not blood related, you're both step-siblings.  seriously speaking, you're young and it's not going to last.  stop now!!|`|vUAjf0t1aa	You two aren't related, so why not? You can try to date each other, that'd be perfectly fine. Just remember, he's always going to be a part of your life (assuming your step dad and mom don't break up), so just always have that in your mind.    Have fuuun!!!
oQTjeOekaa	you can NEVER be too careful. it is better to be safe than sorry. it is when you least expect something bad to happen that it usually does. So be careful, because once something happens, there is no turning back the clock.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	What CN said is completely true:    The pill is not 100% effective so go the extra mile and use a condom too.    Sure it may not feel better, but which option do you like better?  Extra pleasure and possible pregnancy OR Safer sex that still feels great?    If it has a tendency to split use spermicide to. You can usually get some at your local pharmacy or Walmart.|`|VClxXNs3aa	the pill is not 100% effective and if you use a condom in addition to the pills you are more protected.|`|zHRWklEWaa	If you have been checked for STDs and turned out negative and are both loyal then STDs are not a problem. If you haven't been checked or somebody is cheating then you can't garentee that.    The other problem is that BC fails. I have a sibling concieved through birth control failure. A condom minimizes that even more.|`|6gthdHpnaa	The pill is not 100% guaranteed, and a condom adds some to that. It's still not 100%, but there's some more protection.   And be aware that unless you have been tested for STI's, even if you're both virgins, you could still have them as there are other ways they can be transmitted (from the mother during pregnancy, unclean needles, etc). And some of them don't show symptoms. So if you haven't been tested, you should both go just to make sure.|`|hstwNjNaaa	It's better safe than sorry.

The more forms of protection you use (especially considering you're teenagers, and you're going to fall under the "typical use rate" of any birth control), the closer you are to 99.99%.  Just remember there is still that 1 in 1000.    Also, because I read your edit, if the condoms are splitting then there is not enough lubrication.  Either the condoms are too old or you are not producing enough naturally.  You can purchase lubrication from Spencers and the like.|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	Because condoms protect from (S)exually (T)ransmitted (D)iseases, yeah, I understand, you say you are in a committed relationship and I do hear you, so then you deep down inside feel that you are safe, but know, it will take just one time of transgression, and all can come tumbling down in a heartbeat.

Strep throat can lead to serious illness, so it's important to know it isn't strep throat.    Babies can get "chest" infections that can be serious (particularly if she hasn't yet had a Hib vaccine).       Some doctors advise against using Vicks on babies.  Here's a good article on that:    http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/01/1...    Other than making sure a doctor sees her to make sure she isn't developing something really serious, parents are usually told to use a cool mist humidifier.   Clear fluids may be better than milk.  Milk increased mucous production.  (Based on the article above, apparently, so does Vicks.)

TK03jZTuaa	if you feel sticky and slimey down below that is sure sign that you are right around ovulation. That is the body's way of making it easy for a pragnency to occer. It is easier for the man in that condition.  If you see no mucous then you should be at least four days away from ovulation. You should ovulate around day 14 of a 28 day cycle. You might have longer or shorter times in between periods but you ALWAYS bleed 14 days after ovulation. If your periods are further apart, your ovulation date will be later.

(His arms, etc are fine though).  It's just them touching his face that drives me crazy.  Especially if I know someone used the restroom without washing their hands.....That drives me CRAZY!!  I always have hand sanitizer in my bag because a lot of the people that live in my area are not very big on hygiene.

Your symptoms of pregnancy will usually appear anywhere from the first week of your expected period to 1-2 weeks after your first week of expected period. Your first signs of pregnancy most commonly include missed period, tender/swollen breasts, change in color of the breasts, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, increased sense of smell, and weight gain    Most women find that vaginal discharge increases when they are pregnant his is quite normal and happens for a few reasons. During pregnancy the cervix (neck of the womb) and vaginal walls get softer and discharge increases to help prevent any infections traveling up from the vagina to the womb.    some unavoidable weight gain is also a sign. Your clothes are getting tighter, you are feeling bloated, the weight showing on the scale is going up... you are getting bigger and that is simply part of being pregnant.    Breasts may be very tender, swollen and start to enlarge.  Many times the veins within the breast will become more visible. Your nipples may start to darken in color, become more erect and be extremely sensitive.  These symptoms are due to increasing amount of hCG hormone that begins at implantation.     Hope this helps!!may God bless you!!I hope you got BFP!!To  All the ttc-ers Dont give up HOPE This is our year!!    Take care
I40vnqNyaa	Listen, can i be really honest with you?.. Stop being a wimp.  read your own story back.  This guy is completely irresponsible.  sometimes you can be too close to see the truth, especially if you're in love with someone.  Think about it.  Ok here's a guy when you met him his girlfriend, who he wasn't with anymore was pregnant.  Then, you are with him and a short while later you are pregnant.  What does he do about either?  Nothing.  Say's "its up to you, you can decide".  You try to talk to him and what do you get?  Apathy.  Listen, you should have been more careful yourself, theres no denying that, but look at his track record.  Does this guy not know how to use a condom? If he was so against abortion, he would wear one.   and seriously, how old is he?  You can't go through life getting every girl you sleep with pregnant then act like its up to her to decide what the best thing to do is.  Personally, i believe you can do better.  Dont YOU think you can do better? If you want to have kids,  you want a MAN.  A man who WANTS to be a dad.  There is more to being a dad that merely having sex with the mom.  Stop feeling sorry for this loser and move on.  He's holding you back! Sorry to be so brutally honest but guys (notice i didn't say men) like this really annoy me.  Get yourself on the pill.  Make the next guy you sleep with wear a condom and stop letting wimpy guys like this infect your life.  I really hope you re-read your own story and try and see what im saying to you.  You have your whole life ahead of you, don't waste it on someone like this.  I think if your having trouble getting over it, maybe you should seek counselling.  Having an abortion is a difficult thing and truth is it will probably stay with you forever.  You need to find a way to come to terms with it and get on with your life.   You can do it.  You just need to talk to someone.  I wish you the very best of luck, and i hope this all works out for you.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No offense,but are you dense? He said he didn't believe in abortion,that kinda means he wanted you to keep it,but wasn't going to put on the pressure..  Just because he wasn't going to push his decision on you,doesn't mean he's emotionally okay with your choice. That's something you've both got to live with now.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	That's a very big possibility it has played a very big role. i think if i were a guy this would completely changed the way i looked at someone. im sorry for ur ordeal|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	Does it really matter? I mean are you trying to date this guy? It seems you two shared a very unfortunate event I would be trying to avoid him as you know he said he didnt agree with abortion he probably wasnt to happy about it either way why dont you find a guy who cares about you and makes his feelings clear?|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Sounds like you are both a bit irresponsible. And I am not sure how old you are, but you are coming across as very immature. Perhaps it is the spelling and grammar. Hes. His. He's.    You aborted your baby based on your own presumptions. He told you that he is against it. And he understands you cannot ruin your life??? Babies ruin lives now?   If your life is ruined, You ruined it yourself. You are more concerned with him speaking to you and ignoring you off and on.   He seems to spread his seed around a lot. My oldest son's father was like that. He has about 3 or more kids about the same age.  Not the kind of 'man' I wanted to be around.
bvYPr0Cvaa	There noses can bleed a little if you overuse the sucker, try usng saline drops in her nose, (Little Noses) is a brand for babies and children, you can get it at wal-mart in the cold and flu medicines.|`|qKQFcwVTaa	I had the same problem when my girl was a newborn. Doctor told me to suck  her nose very gently. Make sure you buy saline drops and use them before you suck her nose. If it is only a little blood that is ok because her nose is irritated from cold and so it is normal. But if its a lot of blood then don't suck. It could hurt her too much. Use bulb sucker it there is too much blood. The bulb sucker is not too strong and so it is more gentel. Also if you use electrical sucker buy different sucker that is more gentel. I like the one mother suck the air out herself. It gives you control over the strength of suction and it can minimize your babies bloody nose.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Well, since it is dry in your house, the blood could be from the dryness in the house.     It could also be her adenoids. I used to have problems with them when i was a child and always had blood everytime i would blow my nose. So when they took my tonsils out, they also removed my adnoids.     But in your situation, it does sound like its due to the dryness.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	if it helps use it, i do|`|zhqSxJS9aa	how old is your daughter my son gets a runny nose when his teeth are playing up|`|Op2AYA1eaa	Using your bulb syringe is great.  If you use it to much your babies nose will get irritated a bleed a little.  If you need to use it though, then use it.  Especially before she eats.  It may also help to get saline drops and instill a few drops into each nare before suctioning her out.  It will help to break things up better.  The key to using a bulb syringe is to make sure it is far enough in the nose to get a good seal or close the nasal passages around the syringe to get a good seal.  That way you can truly suction the snot out.

Kinda weird.  Hope this helps.|`|2LKABDPzaa	My daughter was also born with broken blood vessels except in both eyes. It was from the pressure on her little head while she was being born. It is normal. The red eyes look like they hurt but really it doesn't affect your baby at all. It's just that the blood diffuses out into the liquidy part of the eye. She might already have "popped' other blood vessels in her eye from before. I wouldn't worry about it. It should probably disappear within a couple of weeks. If you see any other kind of discharge like yellow pus, I would go see the doctor right away.|`|1Q0dAOffaa	It does not take much for blood vessels to "pop" on your eye.  This subconjunctival hematoma ( wow I remembered the medical name!) should be nothing serious but I would ask a Dr. to be sure.  I had the same once with a stomach virus.

LbkLg4RFaa	Fruit fingers were a big hit with our son for breakfast with a little yoghurt or some of my cereal.  With two teeth he was able to eat a whole soft pear.  Pancakes were another favourite as well.  If you have introduced egg then scrambled egg is another option for breakfast as well as toast fingers, (personally we waited on the egg because of my allergies)    Lunch was usually some of what I ate.  Either sandwiches, salad or left-overs like stir-fry or fried rice with vegetable pieces.    Dinner was also pieces of what I ate.  Steamed or roasted vegetables, Stir-fry, mild curry, casseroles, ravioli, pieces of pasta or vegetables from soup.

Just dont add any salt yourself.|`|AA11596130	You're right all ready to serve sauces contain a lot of sodium for your baby. you can just boil some spaghetti and add butter and cheese, or try this recipe if you have the ingredients  1 celery stalk, chopped  1 carrot, peeled and chopped  6oz fettuccine  1tbsp olive oil  2tbsp fresh mint, chopped    Place the carrot and celery into a pan of water and bring to the boil.  Add the fettuccine and cook at a high simmer until tender.  Drain.  Warm the olive oil, then stir in the mint.  Pour the mint oil over the pasta and vegetables and serve.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Yeah I hate those bottle sauces because they contain preservatives. My daughter loves my spag bol and is really simple heres the recipe, you can adjust it to how like.  This recipe serves approx. 2 adults and 1 toddler/baby.    INGREDIENTS:  500g lean/heart smart minced beef                           spaghetti (I just guess how much)                           1desertspoon olive or canola oil for frying                           1 tin chopped tomatos                                                 1 sachet (no salt) tomato paste                           1 medium onion, chopped                           1 small carrot, grated                            broccoli, (not too much) grated or chopped                            1 teaspoon of                            garlic paste (leave this out if it upsets baby)                            1 teaspoon of Vegemite or 1 beef stock cube                            1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley                            1/2 teaspoon of sugar                            Use salt and pepper to taste after serving                            Grated tasty cheddar chesse or parmesan           METHOD:   -Add spaghetti to boiling salted water and cook till done.   -Heat oil in large frying pan and add onion and garlic and sautee for a     couple of mins.  -Add mince and cook until just browned.  -Add vegemite/stock, tomato paste, tomatos, carrot and broccoli and     simmer for about 10 mins.  Add a little water at this point if drying out     too much.  -Add sugar and parsley and cook for a further 5 mins  -Serve and top with grated cheese  YUMMY!  It is easier than it seems and tastes sooo much better that the bottled sauce.  Give it a go!    -If you use fresh mince that hasn't been defrosted then this is great to  freeze for a quick healthy meal for bubs.  -Using a little sugar breaks down the acidity of the tomatos.  -Chopped mushrooms are another good addition.  -If you like the taste, add chopped basil as well.  -You could use a squirt of b-b-q sauce for extra taste or instead of stock or Vegemite.  -I love my spag bol served with either garlic bread or a fresh crusty roll.                                                          ENJOY!|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	It'll be ok as long as you don't add extra salt to it.
LbkLg4RFaa	What we did at 8 months old was to feed him pieces from our dinner.  So if we had a casserole he would have some of the vegie and meat pieces cut into pieces that he could easily self feed with.  The options are endless our son would eat things like ravioli, gnocchi, pasta bakes, roast or steamed vegies, stir-fry with noodles, crusts off home-made pie with the filling.  Whatever I made he would have as well.  Just be sure to cook with salt and less oil.|`|U36GI9FUaa	you got hot women answering dude|`|0VHolTVEaa	Try giving cubes of potato, chicken peices, broccoli florets, boiled carrots, toast with a little butter, pasta peices, try a different variety of foods that he likes.|`|qChv1Bymaa	sushi.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	fish fingers, steamed/boiled vege sticks/cubes, chicken breast pieces or nuggets, little sandwich squares|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I feed my nearly 9 month old twins some finger food meals here are some of the things they get wedges of boiled potato, cooked pieces of veg, small chunks of meat, sandwich with cheese spread cut into small pieces, toast, breadsticks, french toast, omelette cut into small pieces, pasta, pizza, garlic bread, they give just about everything a try.

Cheese pieces.  Small, boiled, chicken pieces (if he has enough teeth)  Commercial baby foods have lots of finger foods for babies.  Small, boiled, diced potato.  Canned, diced carrots (they're soft) (or at least boiled frozen or fresh ones)  Peas (canned are softest; they come without salt in the can if you look for it)  If he has enough teeth, scrambled hamburger.  Cheerios are something babies like.  Add a side of milk, and they have breakfast.  Bananas sliced and maybe then cut into smaller pieces.    He's still pretty young, so you do have to be careful that the stuff is soft enough (or, in the case of Cheerios, will soften).    A lot of people let their baby have junior foods for meals, but then let them have a sampling of baby-appropriate, soft, finger-type, foods when the family is eating dinner.|`|n8qfvIZfaa	my daughter is the same so we have 2 spoons at mealtimes and she has a go at feeding herself.

SBZOVEueaa	cloth diapering is super easy    you do not have to rinse out in toilet    you do not have to keep them in water or anything like that - there are 2 methods wet pail/dry pail    dry pail is easier for me - and it does not stink up your house at all - in fact i just use a foot operated garbage pail w/plastic garbage bag and have no odor probs at all    some will get stains - you can just hang them on the clothes line for a few days for the sun to bleach out the stains - out of all my diapers - i have less than 12 that are stained - in the summer i hang on the line and in the winter i use a dry (summer sometimes to if rainy, no time, etc)    whether or not they are right for you depends on you    there are TONS of websites for cloth diapering - i knew i was going to cloth diaper before i got pregnant and spent most of my whole pregnancy researching    a few sites to try:  cottonbabies, diaperhyena, diaperpin, diaperswappers, and montana diaper store (cant remember website name)        how often you have to wash depends on how many diapers you have    i started out w/36 infant prefolds (craigslist & from target gerber Diaper Service Quality - they are only available on line now) and a lot of flat fold diapers    it took me a while to find a cover that worked for us - as an infant the wool covers worked best for me because they were pull on and had a much better fit    after that i had 36 premium prefolds w/about a dozen or so bought along the way (flannel, birdseye, and terry) i added about another dozen toddler size    dappi diaper covers worked best for me until she hit the toddler size in those (they are short in the rise) after that i was on the hunt for something that worked better - that was the stacinator and thirsties still using a wool cover as well - i switch them out to match outfits or just whatever mood i am in that day    i also have some doublers that sometimes i just use in a cover instead of a diaper - that works just as well    i have more than enough diapers to go up to 4 days w/o doing diapers but i like to do them at least every other day when the garbage pail gets full - it is just easier to keep up w/laundry that way    washing them is a little bit special - you can not use fabric softener, you should not use bleach and you need to use a soap that leaves no build up or residue (i use the free and clear detergents) about every other month or so i do a vinegar wash - and rinse at least 2 times before washing - i usually do the vinegar one in hot water - the rest are cold water unless i have had to use any ointments on her - which is rare - then i do a hot rinse then a normal wash    that is the cheapest method -     you also have other options such as all in ones, pocket diapers, one size diapers, contours, etc    i have had more leaks with the few times i have used disposables than i have had total with the cloth    good luck and enjoy your baby|`|JxCCjH0Uaa	You need about 24 cloths and about 6 covers and of course you will need to get more when they grow out of them. yes sometimes they will get stained but just wash them in a little bleach every once in a while. wash them in baby detergent. I wash mine when im about to run out of them (when they are all dirty). thirsties brand are my favorite. go to www.greenmountain.com . You will know if its the right choice for you when you have used them for a week or two. And keep in mind that you will have accidents from time to time. You have to change them a little more often than disposables because they are not as breathable like the store-bought ones are. I didnt like them at first (especially trying to change and deal with them while recovering from a c-section) but now I enjoy them and they save so much money in the long run. Good luck in your decision.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	To start at birth, around 3 dozen is recommended.  The meconium stains, so many moms use disposables until it's gone, or simply use prefolds since they are so durable and cheap, plus hide under a cute cover!  :)  I wash mine every other day using an additive-free detergent (my favorites are Planet Ultra and Shaklee).  It's very easy!  I have many kinds, from Chinese prefolds to fitteds, AIOs to pockets.  I like them all for different reasons.  Many of mine are one-size, so they are adjustable from about 8-35 lbs; it's so convenient!!  I like snap diapers better than the velcro, since the snaps last longer.    I switched to cloth when my daughter was 15 months and never looked back!  I love it!  You said cheaper and better for the environment, which is true, but it's also better for baby (no dioxin), and you never run out at 2 am!  LOL  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you have any questions!    Here's a page on cloth basics I found really helpful:  http://www.cottonbabies.com/clothdiapers...|`|7a927a41251a30f1be3a3c850f61b070aa	Well I had to 3 in half hour.My son just cries out as long as it is little damp.Gave up after 30 minutes and used normal baby diapers after that.Yes you will hv to wash it everyday.I washed them with soap powder which is specially formulated to be used for baby clothes.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Make sure you get a really good diaper pail or your house will reek.  Rinsing the poo out in the toilet is the worst part and remember you'll be doing it for two years.  Maybe contact a diaper service if you can afford it.|`|3G7v7vgfaa	I cloth diaper my 5 month old son, and I wish I had with my other two. I researched a lot before settling on the Bumgenius 3.0 AIO. Cottonbabies.com is where I bought mine. They are pricey, but really worth the money in the long run, this particular brand can be worn until 35lbs. That's what sold me. Not having to buy anymore diapers for 3 years! I bought 25 and that is enough so that I have to wash every other day. The only few of mine that are stained are the ones I left sitting an extra day or two when my little one had a diaper rash from diahrea and he was in disposables for a week.  If you do decide to go with the pricier brand, just remember to read the washing instructions and follow them exactly. The absorbency can get screwed up if you don't. Oh and I use a special soap called Charlies Soap. I buy it on Ebay for a lot cheaper than you can find anywhere else. It works fantastic and I now use it on all of our clothes. I think everyone should be CDing, it is so much better for the environment, and it really is cheaper in the long run.  Did you know it takes 1 quart of oil to make one disposable diaper? And all of the chemicals get leeched into the ground and the baby's skin. Arggg! So gross. I only use them when my baby has a diaper rash 'cause you can't use diaper rash cream in CD. Which I am not even doing anymore because I have discovered corn starch works so much better! Really, once you get over the smell, it's not that big of a deal. I keep mine in a round trash can with a lid, and it contains the smell really well. You really only smell them when you put them in the washer.  Oh and cloth wipes are really important when you are CDing. You just wash them with the diaper. Nothing to it! And you will need wet bags to put them in when your out and about. Good Luck! I hope I was of some help, and Congratulations on your pregnancy!
JXB5pI7Aaa	You don't have to, no.  You can continue breastfeeding your little girl and then feed them both when the new baby arrives.|`|VClxXNs3aa	No you don't have to stop!  I have a 10 month old girl that I am still breastfeeding and I am 12 weeks along and still going with no problems.    The taste of your milk may change but she will probably get used to that, though some babies dont like it.  now, my girl wont take a bottle of the milk I pumped and froze before.  also some women experience a decrease in milk production due to pregnancy but I havent had a problem, you will know if she doesnt get enough.|`|0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	I think for now it should be okay.  But as you get further along some doctors advise against it because nipple stimulation can bring on contractions.  But just talk to your OB about it.
MLPzeOtOaa	As long as the bath is not above 100 degrees you will be fine. You just can not let your body temperature go up. Your baby depends on you to control their temp through  your own.    As for tanning, it just seems like common sense! with all the studies done on the link between tanning and cancer, not to mention how hot it gets in those beds!!    Try those self tanning lotions if you ABSOLUTLEY have to have that summer glow.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	None of those things are ok. It'll hurt the baby.|`|6OVDBiCnaa	u can not take a hot bath    u will boil the baby  my best friend is 6 months pregnant  u can't tan or dye ur hair...    or go roller skating...    there is alot of **** that u can't do|`|OVj5ysDAaa	It is okay to take hot baths...as long as they are shallow, and you aren't in them for long. If you start to feel heated or dizzy, you should get out.    Hot tubs and saunas are not recommended, since they are able to raise the temperature of the amniotic fluid, which is dangerous for the baby.    Tanning? 15 minutes of sun a day is good for you, but stay away from tanning beds and tanning lotions. Your skin absorbs the chemicals which pass into the blood stream and may go to the baby.    When unsure, err on the side of caution.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	You can take as many "warm" baths as you want.  You cannot go tanning, it raises your body temperature too high.|`|qKDOpbc8aa	it is perfectly fine to take a hot bath i'm on baby  3 & nothing is wrong with any & i take hot hot baths usually keep them on the shorter side (under half hour) & i would keep them semi shallow but i wouldn't say no on a bath.  with my first my midwife told me i could use the hot tub if the temp was kept at or|`|oYzXuu4haa	I used to go tanning all the time but the place i went tanning at wouldnt let me anymore b.c i was pregnant. And i also used to go to the "Y" alot and the sign for the hot tub and sauna said no pregnant women! lol. So i never did any of those. I only took one super hot bath when i was pregnant and when i got out i got really dizzy and nausious. That may have just me though, everyone is different. You can always ask your doctor though.|`|AA12091210	Hot baths and sauna are a big no-no when pregnant.  They cause your temperature to rise, and this in turn can overheat your baby, which certainly isn't healthy.  Your little baby likes its little cosy home just the way it is (which is already nice and warm!) and it doesn't have the ability to self regulate its temperature, so you don't really want to go messing about with that.    I don't know about the tanning thing.  I HOPE you are not talking about sun tanning, that is just stupidity (sorry to be blunt but everyone knows about skin cancer these days).  Maybe you should just get a fake tan, better to be safe than sorry hey!|`|EOIxLhBxaa	ANYTHING that makes your body temp rise 100 is a NO. It may miscarry the baby. This includes heating pads, heating blankets, hot showers..|`|VQSgnrbHaa	I guest it is just okay but it is more okay or  more safe to take a "warm bath" for a pregnant woman....
Wn0Hj7H4aa	You'll know when nothing fits anymore|`|VClxXNs3aa	approximately 2 weeks after you "do the deed".|`|2mIhQgV7aa	You wouldn't be able to find out right away cuz the sperm would not even be planted yet...you'd have to wait 28 days after the first day of your last period|`|o0xguOtZaa	You have to wait approximately 1 month.
aP4VQE2taa	If he's really set on it and won't give in, then maybe you can make a compromise?    Like set aside the money if you don't need it right away, and then say like when the baby is a month old, if its not having problems, is sleeping well, you guys have a good schedule and he has time, then that's the first condition, also, if you are looking financially stable and the money hasn't needed to be touched since you put it in savings then maybe he can get it?    I would just say no if I were you, but of course, you gotta compromise sometimes :) I agree though, its a pretty ridiculous thing to want at a time like this!|`|x6IyESABaa	I know how you feel. Sometimes i get so frustrated with my hubby as he rather goes out with his friends then accompany me. My hubby works in a retail line so his hours are long and we don't get to spend time as often as i would like. Plus last week I was down with flu. I just cried the whole day. His unfeeling friend actually commented about what's wrong with leaving a pregnant and sick woman alone!! Guys can be really unfeeling. I lost 2KG that week. It's not worth it getting upset over those unfeeling guys.     Try talking to your BF and let him know about your concern over money. It's really expensive to have a baby. The milk power and diapers cost a lot. Instead of getting the xbox, the money can be use for all these necessary items instead.|`|Z1FYjWmJaa	That close to having a baby, I would say that an xbox is a bit out of the question. If at this, the beginning of your babies life, he's more concerned with video games than the baby, things don't bode well for the rest of the child's life. Just my two cents. Good luck!|`|7DF3qLDraa	Put your foot down!! I just had a baby and you have no idea how expensive they are!!|`|XNCWfLz5aa	i was the same way!! lol, babydaddys and there xboxs! but no your not over reacting your in your late stages of pregnancy and probably so fed up and ready/excited for your little one to arrive! everything will be alright. by the way CONGRATS!! :)
kaqPSgTVaa	I haven't but I'm dying to! I'm only 10 weeks but I'm going to Babies R Us on Saturday and probably won't be able to hold back getting some necessities. :)    Start shopping WHENEVER you want to. There is no rule book. With my first pregnancy I started shopping when I was around 20 weeks.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'm only 12 weeks and I've already bought a couple of things. Nothing big like a crib,but an outfit or two.  Most women don't really start buying a lot of stuff until they're six months or so. I think once your belly really starts to show,it's like.. "Whoa,he'll be here any day" kind of thing,so you start to fix up the nursery.|`|UXoTCL98aa	well based on what you said i think that its totally up to you  especially if you will more than likely have a baby shower after the baby is born.  i just wouldnt buy all that many clothes bc that would be good things to leave off your list so others can buy them. especially since you might not still know the sex for sure and after the baby is born everyone will know and can help u out on your clothes supply so on your list id buy just a few clothes that could go for either gender    i see no point in you not going ahead and buying the big things to go ahead and get ready and set up....small things sure go a head an buy too but dont buy in bulk on diapers baby lotion, powder, bottles, bibs stuff like that let others still get u those types of things for the shower after the baby's born  maybe u can still save some bigger items like a pack and play high chair, bouncy swing for the shower too since depending on what u want to do u might not need items like those right away.    im the type that likes to be prepared so ill have less to worry about so sure go ahead and start buying both small and big things now and have fun with it :)|`|fcfd19147db60f65269e3a714d3a6e21aa	Some people do not have baby showers. The way that the economy is right now, people are probably not going to be reluctant to spend any extra money. I would start buying little things now. When you get towards the last 2 months, then I would buy the big stuff like crib, stroller, etc. Good Luck|`|1bnhwGACaa	i kept some of my stuff from my other 2 so i haven't bought anything yet we are waiting to find out what we are having feb 16th i have like 30 outfits that are gender neutral so as soon as we find out im going to spend alot on stuff|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	I will just tell you, I am 32 weeks pregnant and I toom the advice of everyone and didn't start buying anything because I'm waiting on my baby shower next Sunday. DON'T WAIT! If you know you are not having a shower, now is a good time to start thinking about buying a car seat, preemie and newborn clothes that you can pack to bring baby home in, bottles, diapers, wipes and formula. I'm in serious panic mode right now thinking I won't have the time or energy to get everything ready for baby to come.|`|eRWXOY0Maa	It's never too early to start stocking up on the things you don't need to know the gender for, such as diapers and wipes. I've found that buying a few things at a time throughout the whole pregnancy helps to keep from feeling overwhelmed towards the end.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Wait to find out for sure if your not having a shower. If not then start buying the necessity's. Diapers, wipes, bottles9 If your using them) receiving blankets and just a few out fits. Newborns grow so fast it's better to get bigger sizes that they stay in longer 3-6 and 6-9. A boppy and a swing or bouncer. You don't really need both but if you can afford it then get both.|`|VHHis05Naa	I didn't have a shower with my first and won't with this one, either.  I started shopping during the second trimester with my first.  We wanted the nursery all done so we bought furniture at around 6 months and everything was done around 7.5 months.  We waited to buy some stuff until after the baby was born so we didn't overbuy or overspend.      With this one, I haven't bought anything yet.  We don't know the gender and we have a lot of stuff left over from our daughter.  If I have a boy, he'll be coming home from the hospital in a pink car seat until we can go buy a new one.  Oh well, it's only five blocks.
xwMWfuBTaa	There is no point in temping anymore.  They can vary so much in pregnancy.  And TBH if they were to drop now its way too early to prevent anything, itd be too late to stop the m/c.    Best thing you can do is have your bloods done - hCG and P4 (progesterone).  After that just take care of yourself, keep eating well, taking your prenatals etc.    Congrats and good luck|`|VMASMHX6aa	I did, and to be honest it didn't do me much good.    Like you, I had read that dropping temps were a bad sign, so I decided to keep temping because I thought some small advance notice was better than nothing.    I then miscarried but my temps did not drop until the miscarriage was almost completely over! The first week of bleeding I had my temp remained high. It only started to drop after I'd had very bad bleeding and knew I had miscarried.  But in that first week, those high temps gave me false hope that all was well. If they drop it is a bad sign, but a one off low reading could just stress you out and mean nothing.  I wish I hadn't carried on temping. It told me nothing and just gave me false hope. I wouldn't recommend it.    Congrats on your bfp!|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Yep, dont do it.  I got my bfp at 12 dpo and I carried on temping. Then the day after my period was 'due', my temps dipped (not below post ov temps, but due to triphasic chart was a fair bit) and i went into a total flap, panicking about miscarriage.  Well, I had a viability scan at 6 weeks due to previous ectopic, and everything is fine.  I was told that the myriad of hormones surging through your system can cause your bbt to fluctuate.  Where a dip in temps can indeed be indicative of impending miscarriage, more often than not it isnt, and isnt worth creating more worry by continuing to chart.  Stop taking your temperature and enjoy your bfp.  Worry is bad for your baby! (I know easier said than done).    Congratulations and good luck!!    xxxxxxxx
433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Depends on how nice your sonographer is. It IS possible to tell the sex at 17 weeks, as the baby's sex organs have formed by 14 weeks apparently, but many dont want to commit to telling so early, or it may not be as clear, so the usual is at 20 weeks. I found out the sex of my baby at 16 weeks, but only because of an absent minded slip of the tongue.. I was told for sure the sex of both babies at my 20 week scan. If you're unlucky, bubs will decide not to play ball, and telling of the sex will be impossible because they'll keep their legs firmly closed and refuse to budge..|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	yes you can BUT may not be as accurate! people prefer to tell you the sex when things are a little more developed but with the right view you may be able to find out.  Most people like to do it after 18weeks, your only a week behind that so I wouldnt think it would be an issue|`|AA11840819	yes|`|QAwpHBucaa	usually at 5 and a half months. so i think that's 22 weeks.    hers some more info on it  http://www.babygenderprediction.com/how-...  good luck|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Should be able to, but it might not be as obvious.  I heard they can tell you as early as 14 weeks.  If they cant tell at your next scan, ask if you can come back.  They normally should oblige, apparently you get 2 more scans after the first.  If baby is hiding its bits after the 2nd attempt, they wont offer you any more and you will just have to wait and see, or maybe pay for a private scan.  Of course, i am talking UK here, if you are elsewhere, rules are going to be different, but i guess this may help other asking the same question from the UK.|`|AA10526789	yes,we were  told the sex of all 3 of our children the 12 week scan and all were correct|`|Opq1Hy3vaa	yes you can tell at 17 weeks, i found out with both of mine at 16 weeks, but some doctors can tell you at 12 weeks, the further gone you are the more chance of them being right, i was told right both times! - two boys who were not shy at all!!! good luck with your pregnancy xxxx|`|Q8tf4B5taa	they normally tell you at your 20 week scan but they should be able to tell you at this scan.|`|LmgDTXTlaa	sometimes they cant tell until the baby is born but the norm is around 20 weeks. they may be able to tell earlier but i Truly recommend waiting until your baby is born. best thing i ever did!|`|xwMWfuBTaa	Yes 17 weeks is fine.    The sex organs are distinguishable from 14 weeks onwards.  I had my second baby after he passed away at 15 weeks, it was clear he was a beautiful little boy.|`|XckJm6HBaa	Trained eyes can correctly predict gender of a baby between 17th and 19 th week of pregnancy. Normally age of pregnancy is counted from LMP(Last Month Period).|`|Xv7xz33laa	You can around 16-20 weeks, but most hospitals wont tell you until 18-20 weeks as it's clearer, and less likely to make mistakes. I found out last week that I'm having a girl! (at 20 weeks)    Stacey|`|VClxXNs3aa	it is possible at 17 weeks, but I wouldnt have my hopes up. I had an ultrasound at 16 weeks, they just couldnt guess.... they told me girl at 21 weeks and that was right!|`|8uiH6iRbaa	the sex of your baby can be seen as early as 10 weeks though doctors will not tell you at that early stage as they cannot be 100% sure     you would normally be told at around 20 - 22 weeks     don't find it out ! have a surprise its much more exciting that way lol x|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Most doctors can tell around 18-19 weeks.  Some can tell before that, but sometimes it's not definite.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	most likely  normally its clearer at 18-22 weeks
Ff3eP90Kaa	I'm in the same position as you. I have a 35 day cycle and I'm a week late today and every pregnancy test, including today's has been negative! Starting to go a bit crazy... I've been told by all my friends and family, who have large families, that they've been pregnant before and had negative tests two weeks after their period was due...    Anyway, unfortunately the only thing you can do is wait it out. If your period comes, you're not pregnant and if it doesn't keep testing every few days and see what the Dr says.    Good luck!!!|`|zI5MekfNaa	sometimes you be on different dates  just go docs|`|xpi33FqDaa	i think your ment to take the test after 2 weeks of not having a period|`|B2WyO7gjaa	thw test should be able to work now...    may be request for a blood test...|`|uLQ3HEDCaa	Go to the docs, you might not have enough HCG yet.   The week before i found out i was pregnant a friend of mine had bought me 10 pregnancy tests as a joke (everyone i worked with was pregnant so they thought i was next!) so i played along. i'd done 4 different pregnancy tests (on different days) which all came back negative.  The following week for a laugh i did one, well, i was shocked when it came up positive! I did the remaining tests just to check and they were all positive. I now have a 9 month old boy! xx|`|xwMWfuBTaa	If the pregnancy was viable your hCG would be high enough 19 days after ovulation.    Sounds like delayed ovulation.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Even regular people have crazy ones every now and then.  Then, if you start thinking you are pregnant, you can stress yourself out and make it come even later.  Don't freak out yet.  If you are a week late, any tests out there ought to be accurate, so you probably are just off.|`|z5M8xfhXaa	not sure? try eating eggs and pancakes|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Sometimes there will not be enough HCG at that stage.     Try a first response test. I always found these to be most accurate. Sometimes, the digital ones are not accurate until there is a certain level of HCG (pregnancy hormone).|`|LepOqaN4aa	Just make sure you see the doctor if youre still late.  Dont get too worried|`|hriNq1q7aa	maybe not enough hcg - i took my first test after 6 days showed negative, but after 2 weeks showed positive - now have a 5 month old    good luck with whatever result you want

ZYlr9TSBaa	1) You will feel more pressure down there, will need to pee more & you will be able to feel her head between your legs (or at least that's what it feels like).    2) Don't diet when breastfeeding. Breastfeeding burns 500 calories a day (i've heard) so you might actually lose weight gradually. I've been breastfeeding for two weeks now and i've lost most of my pregnancy weight.    3) I'm not sure about that one, sorry.|`|VClxXNs3aa	1. I knew because I felt like my legs were being ripped from the sockets when I would get up and walk.... at about 34 weeks.  then at my appointment a few days later, the baby was 2 inches lower(the measurement of my belly was)    2. yes you can diet and lose weight while breastfeeding and a lot of women lose weight from breastfeeding itself, though I gained weight(wasnt trying to lose, though.)    3. are you measureing small?   I had an ultrasound at 36 weeks though I wasnt supposed to have another one at all, because I measured small for how far along I was (she was normal size though, they said it was due to her position) may also just be a scheduling conflict at the office, maybe the ultrasound tech is taking a vacation or something.    good luck.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	ur tummy will look lower then normal  breastfeeding is a way of losing weight  i dont know my last u'sound was at 19wks and im 36+3|`|5LzZYrQnaa	im not a mom so about 1 im not sure but for 2 i know that my friend was only able to eat soups right after her baby was born because of her culture and during her pregnancy she was only able to eat the kinds of food from her culture she is asian (mien) i believe for 3 maybe they had some cancellations and bumped you up on the list|`|AYLRIMZJaa	1. Most women can tell the baby has dropped because there is alot of pain in the pelvis area.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone was pulling my legs apart like siscors.    2. You should not try to lose weight while breastfeeding.  The baby gets their calories from you.  Ask your obg-yn and they will tell you the same thing.  Exercise is fine.  And most women lose the baby weight due to the breast feeding.  Also, congratulations on chosing to breast feed.  It is the best thing for the baby, it's the most natural, and you will love it.    3. Yes.  There are lots of reasons.  Ask your doctor why they did it.  But the most common reason is that either they want to know the exact position, or they want to measure the baby to make sure that it's not getting too big.    Good luck to you!|`|WvWFmwQoaa	i don't know the answer to question 2. & 3.as i'm a first time mum too but i asked the same question as you did> How do i know when my baby has dropped?   here are the answers i got.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  i hope this helps and congrats on your baby :)|`|Om1yADWRaa	You will certainly know when baby drops saying that it didn't happen for me till labour.    most women find if you eat what you want breastfeeding does the rest just make sure you keep on Top of it i failed and now paying the price    just probably convenient for doctor i wouldn't worry all babies are different it also makes a difference what size you are but don't worry you'll soon have a nice healthy baby.|`|SY8b17Ldaa	you will feel when your baby has dropped as u feel alot more pressure down there and ur belly will be lower u may find it easier to breathe get relief from heartburn thats a big maybe im 39 weeks and still living on zantac but i also have a condition where i get it anyway i would reccomend exercise when your bub is born dont do any of those silly diets to loose weight cause bub will to bub gets all her nutrients from u just plain old exercise and watch what you eat take bub for a walk in the pram ect he may haved moved your ultrasound forward for many reasons if he hasnt told that he is worrried about anything then i wouldnt worry i had mine at 32 weeks and it was just to see how she is progressing size ect good luck for the remainder of your pregnancy|`|QT5ROElraa	1 my baby "moved down" at around 33 or 34 weeks, but I didn't feel the Urgent need to pee... Now I am past my due date and he officially dropped, and I cannot stand or sit without thinking I am going to pee. When the baby moves I nearly pee. Very frustrating. When the Dr did a membrane sweep she touched his head! So at least I know he is ready if I will ever just go into labor...    2 Yes, you can diet and lose weight while breastfeeding, but be careful. There is a list of things to avoid eating, and a list of good things to eat... Might help to get those lists and work ur diet around it. Exercising might be the best option.     3 I am not sure. Did he mention that he was concerned about anything?
AWdUdVD4aa	Depending on when you ovulated your period might not actually be late. If you ovulated later than usual and your luteal phase is fairly short, then it's possible that the blood you saw was implantation bleeding.    It's also possible that this was AF rearing her ugly head. She just decided to give you some spotting to begin with. If the blood flow does not increase or if you just want be sure, I would suggest waiting 3 days and taking an HPT. If you get a BFN but still no more bleeding, wait 3 more days and test again. If that is negative with still no bleeding, I would call your Dr. and ask for a blood test.    Also, if you have been trying for a year with no luck, it's time to see a Dr. I'm not sure what all you have done in your quest of TTC, but I highly recommend Fertility Friend and charting your BBT.    I hope this helps you any! Good Luck and baby dust to you, too!!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	if your first thought was yes its starting then that makes me think dare you ready for a family. gud luk and if you are ready then baby dust to you. im ttc aswell.

QT5ROElraa	yeah go have fun! I enjoy dancing and it's great to get exercise! Avoiding the drinking and smoking is good. Have fun with your friends, and don't worry about what people say... when people in bars see a pregnant women they sometimes say stupid stuff... just ignore them. I went into a Starbucks and the lady is like "um r u SURE u want this drink, it has caffeine in it" no duh woman its coffee! My dr said it was ok to drink a limited amount, but thats no one elses business! So have fun!|`|SwKPJRNvaa	the womb acts as an amplifier. Dont stand near the bass bins or the baby may be distressed  otherwise if you avoid pills youll both be fine|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Honestly, there isnt any real reason why you shouldn't as long as you avoid the crowds, the smokers and alcohol. But personally I wouldn't anyway. I can't imagine seeing a pregnant woman in a clubbers outfit dancing in a club without thinking that it's wrong in some way.   If you get tired early, you might really struggle and that's not good for you or the baby. Couldn't you get a taxi if you wanted to leave early?|`|AA11567932	Save your money and buy something for the child, I dont agree with it myself that you are clubbing. I know you said you aren't drinking and smoking and you have highlighted the fact that the music makes baby jumpy, think you know its not a good idea this far into pregnancy.      Save ya money for the baby|`|JmM8xCbLaa	Hey go and have some fun while you can.  If its one thing I regret not doing while I was pregnant, its having fun! I took everything so seriously and lived by the book!  I went out once when I was 5 months, and that was it... now I have my beautiful baby who I love very much, but I can't go clubbing :( and honestly, I do miss it. I don't want to leave my daughter with a baby sitter just yet, so I will just hold out until she's a bit older, but take my advice and have fun. Your baby is well protected in there, a bit of loud music will do no harm, just don't make a habit of it, and stay away from smoke and alcohol, and both you and baby will be just fine :)|`|WQR0KEqZaa	I have 4 children the youngest only 3 weeks old, i went clubbing once when pregnant with my eldest who in now 8, i didn't really enjoy myself as i was constantly thinking if my baby was ok, then a fight broke out between to drunk men knocking some people over and i felt really vulnerable i left then and went home.  Its really UP to you but after that once whilst pregnant i stuck to going out for meals in quiet pubs or going to Cinema, boring i know but it felt better for my baby.  Good luck and if you do go have fun x|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Go and have fun. No harm will come to bubba, and you won't be having many nights out once he or she arrives, so make the most of it! You won't be drinking or smoking, so you'll be ok. If your baby becomes more active by the loud music stand away from the speakers! See if it's possible to get a lift back home sooner once you get tired, so you're not forced to stay til the end once you're absolutely pooped out and desperate to greet your bed.. Just make sure you pop out for regular breaks of fresh air, and keep hydrated. Don't stress yourself out though sweetie.. Bubs is better protected in there than you realise, and a bit of loud music wont distress him. It's more than likely he or she just doesn't like the music that's blasting into their baby eardrums, and is thinking mummy has terrible taste in music! Have fun!|`|o0xguOtZaa	Go and have fun! You won't be able to do that after the baby comes, so make the most of it. Take regular breaks and make sure you don't get dehydrated or anything. If you feel tired, you can always get the bus.|`|oQTjeOekaa	i'm not an expert, but if you are as worried as you seem, than you should simly ask your doc if he or she, thinks it is ok. it is good that you have made the responsible choice no to smoke or drink...but i'm not too sure if the loudness of a club is particularily safe for the baby if you are past 4.5 months... be careful, and good luck.|`|y1NsA6awaa	As long as you feel ok then there isnt any real reason not to go. As you said you are not drinking or smoking which is good. But dont over do it on the dance floor, take regular breaks and drink plenty of water. If you are worried though then give it a miss, you will have to slow down soon anyway. I dont think its a good idea if it is a regular thing though, every now and then is fine for now as you need your own time. Just listen to your body and do what its telling you to do!|`|LQnKhiVMaa	i dont see anyharm with going out for a laugh and a giggle... but be aware u will get the odd glance lol... not that it has anything to do with them|`|BgGpGwb0aa	I Just had a baby and I worked in a club until i was 9months pregnant the baby will be fine. My baby likes music and loves to dance for the most part he is a happy baby loves to play and loves to dance. enjoy yourself you don't have to fill left out because you are prego|`|xwMWfuBTaa	At 18 weeks your child can hear noise.  I personally wouldn't be seen in a club during pregnancy, just as most ppl would judge that as somewhat trashy and inappropriate.     I would be spending money on prenatal health and on your baby, i also wouldn't go out if i couldn't even afford a taxi - anything could happen to you or the designated driver.  Thats just not very responsible.      If you rest enough and only drink soft drinks then i doubt it will cause any harm.  Only you can decide what is right.
2C5PAfaZaa	Sorry darling thats horrible for you. I stopped taking the pill (which was painful to stop after 3 years - bad cramps) about 7months before TTC. We used condoms and fertility awareness instead. I stopped taking the pill (Yasmin) as I think it is bad for you. I got preggas as soon as we tried and he is healthy although I had a traumatic pregnancy so sick.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I had to go on the pill for two months to start my periods again after depo...it took me two months after stopping the pill to get pregnant.  I was timing my ovulation so it didnt take very long.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I stopped the pill January 07 and didn't get preggo until november 07. I was on the pill for 2 1/2 years before stopping.   Good luck on your trying! best wishes!
QT5ROElraa	if your cervix is long or hard it will not be "favorable" but the dr can still do one it's just more painful. at 38 and 39 weeks my dr said my cervix was soft but not opening so she couldn't do it... at 40 weeks I MADE her do it anyhow. it took her lik 5 - 10 mins and was more painful, but whats a few mins of pain?     There are all kinds of ways people say will help soften the cervix. sex, walking, squats... and there are ways people say you can get the baby to move down so your cervix will start opening. ras tea, hot showers, walking, sex...|`|Om1yADWRaa	There is only a small chance it will work mine was text book i went into early labour 2 hrs after having it done but they told me its unlikely but Worth a shot. have another one its uncomfortable but its a bit more natural try not to tense up. and think of your baby in your arms the further in she can sweep the better!|`|eD7qRBKHaa	If you aren't ready, you aren't ready.  Doing a million membrane sweeps isn't going to work until you are ready, and they also increase the chance of infection.  Why not just give it a couple more days?
s6qgkfLxaa	Yeah I had the same problem and I talked to a midwife and a doula and they both said to try taking a warm bath in a couple drops of ylang ylang oil... (you can get it at the store)  and that should help soften the cervix.... I went in after that and I was 60% effaced and 2 Cm dialated, so I think it worked for me :-D     but please don't do this if you think your water has broken... it can cause an infection|`|Opq1Hy3vaa	my midwife told me to have lots of sex!!! it didn't work tho still went 2 weeks over with my first and was induced xxx|`|AA11795652	Walk like crazy.  It worked for me.|`|EhK1zffRaa	i was told the oil thing too worked for me|`|VClxXNs3aa	have sex, the semen is said to help things along......  how far along are you?  they have something they can use to prepare your cervix at the hospital.....  some type of gel, I dont know the name of it.
4d8yOK3iaa	I started getting mine at about 36 weeks. They feel like mild to moderate menstrual cramps to me. They aren't regular and you may or may not get them everyday. Also they can feel like your stomach is tightening as well. They help your body prepare for labor is all. I will be 38 weeks on monday and they are getting a little stronger, but nothing that has been too  uncomfortable. Some wome do confuse them for the real thing because  they can be close together but they aren't consistent. My mom always tells me that when real labor hits you, you'll defiantely know it.|`|AA10811426	I never got them!    I am told they feel like a tightening around your belly.|`|74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	They feel like stomach cramps lower down below the naval. They start around the last month or two of pregnancy and they are not regular. They can become quite strong. You will know them when you get them. Some women mistake them for labor. But they are different since they are irregular in timing.|`|GqdC9Hx3aa	This is what I felt: (I have 2 kids)    It's like a small cramp.    They shouldn't be painful. And if more than 4 come in an hour call your Dr. It could be a sign of pre-term labor (had it with my 2nd).
Ka52nbhNaa	It depends on more than age - the reason that you are seeking IVF, your medical diagnosis, the semen count of your partner, quality of your eggs and the number of embryos that you transfer back all impact your success rate.      The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology which rates and evaluates clinics throughout the US, puts the average success rate for a live birth to a woman under 35 at about 38%.      https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_Pu...    I was 34 and my DH was 36 when we tried IVF - they retrieved 11 eggs but only 2 fertilized - the retrieval was good but for whatever reason our fertilization rate was pretty low.  We opted to transfer both embryos back and see what would happen . . . my IVF twins are now 5 months old!  Blessed on our first try.    Best wishes fo you!|`|uQc4UA2Caa	dear trying to concieve, i was going to try ivf because i tried for years then amazingly it happened naturally (when i stopped keeping track of the days of my cycle) it was an annoying surprise every time i got my period but SO worth it now1   i think being 25 (i am too) my documents said that u are about 34% successfull on the First try which is VERY good!  the percentage varies between the methods used ie the sperm being placed in the uterus or the egg. the success is Totally based on the health of your egg they are using there is at this pressent time no option available to test the eggs quality though but  being young u have the Best chance   GOODLUCK. hope this has helped :)|`|FxLaA8d6aa	on ths age the success rate is good,and hopefully it wll be positive in first try.  so best of luck !|`|VK3uWrs1aa	yes.|`|Ql44BXFHaa	i'm 30 and my re said that our chance to conceive on first  ivf was around 60%!!  but that's if enough eggs are retrieved and they fertilize appropriately.  i'm trying to stay positive - keep telling myself stress will only hurt - so i'm banking on the 60% stat bc it makes me feel good.  he also said if 1st doesn't work and we had enough viable embryos we could try with frozen emb and the success rate for that is around 35-40% on 2nd and 3rd try.  hopefully you have even higher % since you're 5 yrs younger!!  baby dust and good luck with the ivf.  i start my injec this week...  a little nervous but excited|`|wiyQ3m9Vaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.    http://www.indianmedguru.com  You can get much information in this website.|`|N1RPgaT2aa	hi im 25 and im busy with my first invitro.I had a long protocol ivf, had my egg retrievel yesterday.Dr retrieved 11 eggs im doing ivf with icsi because of male fertility..im phoning the dr at 13:00 to hear how many eggs fertilized . are u starting ivf
1CryEnb3aa	Its about time her body would have had its next period.  As long as its dark blood or brown and not heavy, she should be fine.  I would call her dr/nurse and let them know just to be on the safe side.  Plus hearing it from them would probably give her more reassurance.  Good luck and congrats!|`|YseGAHIfaa	i bled too. i'm three months pregnant & the baby is fine!   if the bleeding gets heavier & she gets any pain then go to the hospital. there could be other reasons that are not related to miscarriage like it was old blood, the uterus is stretching or a vein has burst in her vaginal wall. if she gets scared/worried then go to the hospital    lots of luck
TprIqGhCaa	It could have to do with his sperm count, or his semen vein could be smaller than average, lots of things. It took me and my husband 3 years to get pregnant. Don't worry about it.|`|9rTeVPqBaa	i fell preg with my daughter at 21 after, 4 months of not using the pill or anything... trust me i thought i had something wrong with me!! i even went to the doc about it!!! were trying for another now and its been 5 months : (   but thats ok... it'll happen|`|5pGfmlxcaa	well if ur not trying then why are u askin? duhhhh   ive been trying for almost a year    but i havnt got pregnant because i was recently on birth control so ima give it another year or so   go to your doctors u might not be able to have kids   if u are able then u need to geet your hormones checked chick|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I think the stats are that only 60% of couples get pregnant within 6 months of actively trying. And that means actually trying to have sex during ovulation.     You may not be having sex during your most fertile days. Or, you may just be one of the many people who are more average in how long it takes them to get pregnant.     If you really don't want a kid right now, maybe rethink the not using protection.|`|taZ9w8kOaa	u know what im thinkin the same thing about me except we have been together for 3 years and have been trying off and on for about a year
tXlvg1ahaa	Why make a choice now?  Nothing pushing you...  Take your time and allow a third and a fourth guy in to your life so that you have a better range to choose from.|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	First, learn how to spell.    Second, don't write in caps.    Third, find some decent guys with futures.|`|HOdblqIkaa	both arent in school one has a job and the other does drugs? 'trying to quit' isnt a definate "im going to quit" hes not getting help to stop so chances are hell go back to it eventually. the second guy at least has a job. if you cant pick one over the other maybe you should consider being single and getting your life together so once you know who you are youll be able to figure out who you want/need in your life and who will be the best for you in the future and not just for right now.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	They both sound like ******* retards to me.|`|35eihkZmaa	from the way it sounds neither is mr. right. dump em both and find ONE guy who can give you something bettter!|`|ZcTW0fY2aa	I don't agree with meg,  What sounds like idiots to her might sound like amazing to you.     You know,  There are two options.    1) Don't chose either, they might be great but ask yourself this question, "Who will stick around the longest?" You should know the answer, dear.   2) Chose the one that answers that question right there ^^^ or, chose the one that makes your heart smile, truly. The boy that you don't even have to do anything and you make him happy or he doesn't even have to do anything and he makes you happy.     Just trying to help.  Good luck.|`|4dLPiqlZaa	First, why do you NEED any male, and I say male because neither one is a real man.  A real man doesn't need drugs, alcohol, sex, doesn't drop out of school, isn't jealous, doesn't abuse a woman, is responsible, honest, and secure.      Second, sounds like you need to pay more attention to school and learn how to write and express yourself better because you obviously cannot spell.  Take care of yourself, get an education, a job that where you can support yourself, you don't NEED a guy to make you a woman or a whole person.  When two people are in a loving relationship it isn't about the things that you are speaking about.  It is about committment, respect, responsibility, love isn't a feeling it is a choice, during the good times and the bad times.      When you can be responsible for yourself, are educated, and don't float along with the streams of "what is cool", know who you are- find out- then you will be ready for a mature relationship, not just some temporary roll in the bed and then trying to take care of the product of that - KIDS!     You are made to be better than you are know, don't live on the lowest level of life, aspire to be the best.|`|rVs2nfgGaa	If you have to select one the second who does soccer. At least he isn't in drugs. and if a guy tries to do anything he doesn't want to do "for you" they will always go back to it and jealous guys are losers. personally i wouldn't want either find a guy who is working at making something of himself by going to school and has goals.|`|Bf4ipf7Xaa	Sorry girl they both don't seem like stable guys and I would say go for someone you really do deserve and someone who will actually stick around. If you put yourself out there you will find someone perfect and you won't need to question if they are good for you cause you will know.  If u don't follow this advice just follow your heart and you will know in time.
eSOzKj0Waa	That's gorgeous!! I think it's a very pretty twist on the name Lara, I really like it!!

Makes me think of lyrca.  And when i think of lyrica, i think of overweight men on bikes.... not pretty.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	i love it! it's one of my top 4 choices for girls names right now.    as for a middle name, just make sure not to use one that ends in "A" like Lyra does... you don't want the first and middle names to rhyme!    ideas:    Claire  Jade  Rae  Mae/May  Rose  Joy  Hope  Faith  Brielle  Jaelle    any middle name that ends in "-lynn" or "-lyn" would work well too!    Avalyn  Jaelyn  Raelyn  Lynn  Madelyn|`|3Fq0HaIAaa	It is Lyra (Lie-Rah) and I like that name :) The heroine in the series His Dark Materials is named Lyra.|`|qcwcj99Paa	I like it. I first heard in The Golden Compass movie.|`|cx4kGsN0aa	I think it's absolutely musical.  It reminds me of a lyre.  I saw it in "Golden Compass" too, if I had found it in some random baby book or something, I'd be more likely to use it, but I'm afraid it will be overused. It's almost too delicate to use, because the second there are 5 Lyra's per daycare center, it will no longer be as special IMO.|`|N5EhfDX2aa	Its nice and you don't see many L's around these days. I prefer Myra; its very old fashioned but I think its beautiful and I have a good friend called Myra.

HqtdnJvqaa	my hubby came to my baby shower it was no big deal. mostly he just brought the camera and recorded everything. it was nice because he got to help me open presents and feel like part of it all. im all for hubbys attending, after all it is their baby too.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I think it would be ok for him to attend.  Let him be apart of it.  Traditions don't have to be followed it is 2009!  Besides, he can help load up all the gifts and heavy stuff!  Have a great time and congrats!|`|k9nLue0Uaa	lol I honestly think do whatever you want, I even have guys coming to my baby shower who have been friends with me for years, it entirly up to you.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Is this sitch you cancel the shower and spend time with your man, you and him. No matter who complains, its you and him. Your mom is kinda not very compassionate is she? Sorry. Please may I think you both, I appriciate your sharing your husband and allowing him to serve our country. If foods been paid or and cant be changed take it to church or a shelter and have none at the next one. This is not even an issue in my mind hes home, hes with you!!|`|J3TRJPIwaa	So many showers are male and female now days. If she won't change her mind then put together a diaper party for him. Get all the guys together to watch a game or shoot pool, drink beer, whatever - the catcher is that each guy has to bring a pack of diapers. You could have this be the same day and time and then meet up after to discuss how the parties went.|`|UAunAKdtaa	aww let him come, he doesnt see you much looks like...Dont leave him at home. i bet there will be a lot of heavy presents to help out with! make the best of your day, your baby is on its way and if there is a chance he wont be there for delivery then let him be part of other things.Tell your mom that you appreciate your hubby being with you since you dont have much time together. its not like you ladies will be doing dirty things, its just a baby shower!|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, your mum is from the "old school" of thoughts and beliefs.  You are right, it is your shower and often a girlie thing where you will sit around, munch on yummies and talk baby talk.  Your husband may not want to be a part of that "girlie talk".  I would certainly advise him of that and let him make the decision, as you said, he's a proud first daddy too!  As for him being useless in thedeliveryy room, well that is still to be decided.  Train him now to wait on you hand and foot! hahaha seriously honey.  Yeah he may be a little overwhelmed but you have to remember, he is watching his wife deal with pain that he can't even describe let alone compare it to so yes he will be a little emotional himself.  Get him to rub your back, hold the shower on you, anything. The midwives will also guide him too sweetie, you have to remember and so does your mother, he's not the only first time dad in the world, midwives see hundreds a week! I do hope you are planning to let him in though, it will be an experience he'll never forget.  When my husband saw our first being born, he said to me then that he has a new found respect for the female body, he said the experience was awesome. I just had my husband and midwives in the delivery room. We decided that we created this little life together and we were going to bring it into the world together (with the help of midwives of course!).  I remember my mother insisting that she was going to be there for the birth of our first, because she was for my sister's. I had to tell her no.  She wasn't happy but she got over it and especially once she held her new granddaughter for the first time.  My 2nd & 3rd, I gave her the job of baby sitting the others and she was happy.   I hope everything works out okay for you too sweetie.  Tough times ahead by the sounds of it, go with the flow and do what you want, it's your and your husband's baby.  All the best and good luck xx    edit: my hubby didn't want to come to my baby shower (at our home), he went out with his mates (and did guy things before the baby duties kicked in), he didn't want to hang around for girlie talk and baby talk hahaha!!|`|Coc593Ikaa	Honestly, it is very odd. The shower will only be a few hours of your day. You can leave him close by so you can meet up soon after. But your mother is right about this one, unless you are having a co-ed shower. But I'm assuming that is not the case here.    ADD: He'll be in for weeks...I don't get the big deal about spending a few hours away from him.    ADD: JC has a good suggestion. As the planning for your shower is obviously underway, switching it to co-ed is probably out of the question. So plan a separate shindig for the guys! Your man would probably enjoy getting some guy time in while he is on leave.|`|mtDWu8sXaa	Hell no, tell your momma that he is coming or you aren't!  Mine came to mine and he was a hoot!  They enjoy that stuff if they want too, some don't...my husband is in the military and wasn't there the first months of our second daughter's life....he left when she was three months old.....being in military is tough and every moment they share with their kids is precious, never know when the U.S. is going to call them up for to deploy.  If he wants to come, then let him..it's his baby too!  That's ridiculous for your mother even to say that CRAP......ugh!  I'm from the south too, men can attend if they want!  Good luck! =)|`|lzUF22l0aa	mine was there for my first and i had y uncles and my hubbys father there .. i think alot of all the old ways of going about ahving babys and this is one tradition that is changing if you want him there then he should be there .. good luck with the shower and being a new mommy soon|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	My fiance attended both of my baby showers.|`|Jo3Ma2NOaa	people have co ed baby showers all the time.....heres a website i went to when we were looking for baby shower games that has a bunch of co-ed games    http://www.babyshower101.com/baby_shower...      hope it helps|`|DpbZdIsUaa	It's a shame you're not having it at your place.    They wouldn't be able to kick him out of his own house.  Just a thought..... Maybe a day or two before the shower you could say your feeling unwell and don't feel like going anywhere, then ask your mum and friends if it would be possible for them to come over to your place instead...  I've been to baby showers where the guys have been there.  Tradition I'm not sure of.  I think the reason guys aren't usually at baby showers is because they don't want to be!   Your husband won't be useless in the delivery room.  He can rub your back and help you sit up,  you'll have his hand to squeeze 'till it's blue.... Only joking with you!  If he wants to be there and you want him there, he is the best person to be there with you.  Congatulations and happy parenting.|`|AhBM5w8maa	I actually had my baby shower last saturday and my boyfriend attended, and had a great time.  There was one other male who is one of my best friends.  There is no reason he shouldn't be able to come, it's his child too and if he isn't going to be there for the delivery then he should get to be there for the baby shower.  I mean he is a good enough man to want to support you, you should let him be involved with anything he wants to be involved in.  No one even cared that there were two guys at my baby shower, they didn't see anything wrong with it, and i live in the south too, and people have their traditions, but who cares it's your day hun.  Just tell your mom that it would mean a lot to you if he could be there, tell her he doesn't get to be around long and you really want him there.    Be nice about it, don't be rude since they are throwing the shower, but make sure your husband gets to be there; He will have lots of fun!    I hope i helped.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	My husband was at mine, along with my dad, grandfather, uncles, and male cousins.  If you want him there, have him there. Your family should be considerate enough to know that it's important to you and allow him there.|`|GAMypxIFaa	Well it is 2009 and if the father is home you should spend as much time as possible with him,my bestfriend had a coed party and loved it, the baby is important to the men in your life as well!! Tell her he is coming!  I hope he does make it home though!1 I am due the 18 and i would be sooo sad to not have my guy! So i hope he makes it back in time!!|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Are the other girls bringing their men?  If not he shouldn't come either.  It would make the party awkward.|`|V4mSLkXdaa	I would just explain nicely to your mother that it is very important to your husband to be a part of the pre-natal functions and that as he probably will not be at the birth, that you wish to include him in the shower.   Years ago, this would not have been appropriate, but times have changed, and my own son-in-law was at my daughter's baby shower and he was a riot holding up all of the clothes and playing with all of the gifts received.  I am so grateful that he was there because it made it a real family event.  Tell you mother nicely that you would appreciate her giving in on this one thing.  Your husband sounds like a real stand up guy -- just don't create problems before the little one is born.  Good luck to you both.|`|F4xIEr1daa	do what you want, it cannot be "improper" it's not like you all will be naked...|`|WjCfrZtxaa	There is nothing wrong with having your husband at the baby shower, as the baby was created by the two of you. Mine will definitely be there. We went so far as to have the baby shower at a mutual place so that the guys can play pool and the women can socialize. Also think about after the shower....who is going to carry away all of the baby's goodies, definitely not you as you are pregnant!! LOL! Have your husband come and relish in the time that you and your husband have together. Good luck.|`|gJDPrl6maa	My boyfriend/babydad came to mine.He was the only male there.but i had mine after the baby was born. He was a major help!!!  I look at it this way its his child too and you two are having this baby together so why cant you have him be there. plus he can help with larger items you receive..  Just bring him what is she gonna do make him go home after he and you already came alll the way?Or not have the babyshower at all.  Its your babyshower. she is just throwing it. Do what pleases you..its your day!!
0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	Yes you can take a pregnancy test.  If you are that far along then the results still should be somewhat accurate.      Bleeding when you are pregnant is normal.  After I got pregnant I have a regularly scheduled period.  It scared the crap out of me until I talked to my OB/GYN.  She said some women are like that.  Some women continue to have their periods 4 months into their pregnancies.  But just watch how long it lasts and how much you are bleeding.  If you are bleeding heavily for too long, see a doctor.  But if it is like a normal period...then relax =)    Hope that helps =)|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Take the test then schedule a doctor's appt. what is normal for some can be a disaster for someone else and not to be taken lightly.  See your own OB-GYN.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	take a test and get a doctors appointment in case you are experiencing a miscarriage.    I had bleeding in the first trimester for about 6 weeks so things can turn out to be ok, but better to be safe than sorry hun. x|`|QM6wiVtVaa	If you're pregnant it would be positive, but since your having "bleeding which seems like period" you may just be having your period, even if it was late.|`|9iOHAC41aa	If your pregnant then yes it should show.|`|YseGAHIfaa	it's possible to bleed & still be pregnant. do a test & see what happens.     lots of luck x
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I doubt there is one. You're better of with those carry/sling type things that you can attach to your body.
ggfE4rlvaa	Birth control is meant to trick your body into thinking it's pregnant. So getting pregnancy symptoms isn't uncommon. To have that many though, it wouldn't hurt to take a test.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Don't worry.  The b.c.p.'s are doing this to you.  It is the hormones causing these symptoms.  Your body will adjust to the influx of hormones.  The pill is tricking your body to think it is pregnant, hence the symptoms.  But, to be extra cautious, use condoms as well.  This will help protect you from STD's, the pill will not.  BTW- you are more likely to get a false negative than a false positive with the hpt.  False positives usually occur if the test was left out too long, or you are on hormone medication.  Good luck|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Go to WalMart and through the self-checkout lane :)    Also, birth control sometimes tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	Just go buy a pregnancy test, it'll ease your mind, and if you are pregnant you'll need to get prenatal care. And for the record, there is no such thing as a false positive :)|`|OWw3LWDCaa	just because he did not go all the way in does not mean you cannot get pregnant, the withdrawal method is not reliable. go get a pregnancy kit or go to the doctor.
RgZ5n0b4aa	Implantation bleeding doesnt happen to alot of people so nothing u should worry about. Make sure you do get to a doctor soon if its gonna be like another month or so i would suggest getting on medicaid just until it kicks in they have to give you some kind on insurance since you are pregnant.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I bled at about 8 or 9 weeks. It freaked me out but it was pink and light and went away quickly. Apparently you could have pee-d it away. All women are different and you might not even have implantation bleeding.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Most women won't have implantation bleeding.  The vast majority of women go there entire pregnancy from conception to labor without ever bleeding at all.   So there is no need to worry about the fact that you didn't have implantation bleeding.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i didnt bleed, not everyone does|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I am 12 weeks now and never had any at all. Just the cramping like my period was about to start.
AA11763588	You can have sex while you are pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If women weren't supposed to have sex during pregnancy every man on the planet would know and be upset and complaining about this. Unless your doctor says otherwise you can have sex.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You can have sex while you are pregnant unless otherwise advised by your OB.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,you can have sex anytime during your pregnancy unless your doctor gives you a specific reason for you not too.  Just,if you're into s&m,tone it down,don't want to hurt yourself lol|`|JsshzKM9aa	Sex during pregnancy is totally fine. Only need to worry if it causes severe pain/bleeding.|`|MqFeJiukaa	I am confused...You can have sex any time in pregnancy unless you have a medical concern that they dr will tell you no.  If you are having a normal pregnancy with no high risk factor then nothing will happen.

gG8oyymiaa	In one week and 2 days you will be 6 months. Good luck hun.    How pregnancy is counted is there is 4 weeks in a month. Our pregnancy is originally counted in weeks though. we have 40 weeks normally that we are pregnant. When you go and do the math we are pregnant for 9 FULL months. People get confused with that. Thats why its just easier going with weeks.|`|UXoTCL98aa	i dont know if it goes by every 4 weeks is a month but if so then Feb. 7th bc that is the beginning of week 24 this website will tell you weekly dates if that helps|`|P8VoBR0saa	I believe 24 weeks, you have 17 weeks and 2 days =121 days|`|Lp0l0PAGaa	teenage mom........................................|`|WFxVuM1Laa	well congrats, my wife is due on the 31st of may so you are close to us on time. the calender is confusing going by you LMP, but you will be at 6mo around your 25th wk.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	24 weeks.....|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Between your 22 and 26 weeks you are 6 months pregnant.

7lr9Da1Gaa	My daughter had the same problem. she would have blood in her stoole it was very sad to see her suffer. my Doctor had recommended miralax. it is over the counter. you just add it to food or the milk. she had started this at about 8-10 months.then i took her off the miralax. once i did it had started up all over again. when she was about 11 months we gave her whole milk. then i tried the 2% and then after that she never had problems again.|`|AA12152549	I think a trip to doctor is in order here.|`|P8VoBR0saa	They have little tummys constipation drops which a friend said work great but what I did was I gave my daughter prunes a lot and also if you lay her on her back on the top of your legs and push her knees into her stomach it will help ease out the bm and gas if she has any hope it helps|`|sAhAEC2qaa	definatly not normal. put vaseline to ease the inflamation and redness and also provide a little lube when she  does go. give her a table spoon of dark corn syrup in 2 oz of water.|`|2LKABDPzaa	No, that doesn't sound normal. I would definitely limit the amount of suppositories you are using. Have you tried giving your baby some undiluted prune, pear or apple juice? About 1 oz between feedings up to 4 oz in a day. If your baby has a bowel movement after 24 hours, stop the juice. If after 24 hours and your baby still hasn't pooped, then you can add 1 teaspoon of corn syrup to your baby's food, 2-3 times a day. Make sure your baby is getting plenty of fibre. Even try a different type of cereal like oat or barley cereal which will make softer poops. This is advice the nurse gave me when I asked her about feeding my 6 month old.
xHKRGEg4aa	The doctor should be able tot ell you by now if your having one baby, or multiple. but if it makes you feel any better, I feel like i'm already showing (not majorly) but enough that my normally little baggy jeans are feeling tight. & i'm only 7 weeks. My stomach already feels hard too.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Wow!  Sounds likely.  You are at higher risk of having multiples as it is the woman's side of the family that effects this outcome.

If you're hoping for twins, I hope you get what you want though:) Sounds like you could be a quick growing pregnant lady:)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have them do another ultrasound to see if they can see another sac but if you've already had two and they only saw one it's unlikely.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	I also explode at the beginning, I looked like a whale. And on 14 weeks I stopped booming. I'm now 22 weeks, and everybody say I'm small now. They also though it was a twin at the beginning.   Don't worry about it, you will stop booming at some point. I now look like someone on 16 weeks. Some people don't even notice that I'm pregnant when I wear certain cloths.    Good luck, and maybe it is a twin, enjoy. Just look at your diet.|`|VZmaDZjVaa	Honey I am 9 weeks pregnant and I look huge too! If this is your first baby I would say it's a great possibility that you may be having twins.  Since first time pregnancies you normally wouldn't look huge this early.

Coc593Ikaa	The aborted babies are not counted in the incidence of DS in live births.    New screening has cut the number of live births by over half (pregnancy book of mine as ref). This is not because the screening fixes anything, but because the pregnancies are terminated.    You cannot multiply the reported incidences (1/500 for example) by 10. The main reason is that 90% of DIAGNOSED DS babies are terminated. But many cases go undiagnosed until after birth. Many women do not undergo screenings if they know that they would not terminate the baby. Many women don't recieve screenings because they were not offered by their doctors. Still others don't recieve prenatal care at all.    ADD: To " 1 on the way", if you had poor results from your screening, let's say 1/28 to toss out a number. Even 1/2, one would not base a termination decision on this fact. The doctor would order a CVS or an amnio. The results of either of these tests is over 99%. Healthy babies are not terminated under suspicion of DS.|`|HclKftzAaa	i know! I thought about this when i had my triple test done. Fortunately i am very low risk. But all the test can tell you really is whether you are higher than 1/300 risk for a downs baby. Frankly, that's a risk i would have been willing to take.    I think the main idea behind it is SUPPOSED to be to get you prepared for maybe having a downs baby. But unfortunately, most ppl aren't prepared to take the risk.    Also, even if your baby DID have downs there's no telling how severe it would be. It could just be a slight problem that doesn't affect their day to day life AT ALL. I would keep the baby still.    Yes, first answerer is absolutely right, dodgy statistics. But the fact remains that the test only tells you a small risk, and is calling the small risk of 1/300 high risk. Surely a large proportion of abortions from this would have been healthy? who knows?|`|4J8X1aKkaa	For statistical purposes the 1:1500 stat has the qualifier LIVE BIRTHS so it only accounts for LIVE BIRTHS not aborted pregnancies. That's the odds of having a DS baby actually born, not the odds of a DS pregnancy.      To find the number of DS pregnancies you'd have to use a different statistical process.  Simply adding the abortions to the live births won't give an accurate result because there are also still births and miscarriages to account for.  Further statistics have to be accumulated over time and in that time frame the screening process has most likely improved, attitudes towards abortion have changed, and possibly the risk factors have changed (for ex. a trend of women having children later).
cjnBs0h6aa	I heard tight underwear (on the man) like briefs and taking hot baths lower sperm count, so make sure he doesnt do those. Have sex when your ovulating your chances are higher then, and just hope for the best. They say people trying to get pregnant dont usually until they dont try as hard maybe due to the stress. Relax and Good luck!|`|9XrGIirVaa	Stop doing 'it' for pleasure.  And tell your ol' man to keep his hand off it.Save it up for when you are ovulating, and go for it.  *Please note*  the word -it- has various connotations here.

Good luck.|`|Ci3Efibkaa	bone... alot|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Don't worry. It will happen when you least expect it.  It did for me.

Good Luck!..., and if all else fails, you can always adopt.|`|6XR6ajTraa	The best thing you can do is be positive. Try using an ovulation calculator or sticks to pin point your perfect time for conception. Then abstain from sex a few days before your ovulation due date and then do the deed on that day. I'd do it two days in a row as the peek time is best and the chance you have for conception is 24-36 hours. It's such a small amount of time. The more you have sex the more the sperm count will go down. Good luck and baby dust to you.|`|zizUbJjTaa	Most men are low in Zinc, which is needed for healthy sperm.

The normal amount is 20 million to 150 million per millimeter of semen. If your sperm count is lower than the normal amount, this could be an indication for fertility problem. A simple sperm count test at laboratory can show you whether you have normal amount of sperm count or low sperm count.    To increase it, you can do:  1. Eat right.   2. Drink more water.  3. Cut back on alcohol and caffeine.  4. Quit smoking.  5. Exercise.    More on it on the source article.    Hope this helps.
bLluZIeTaa	if you didn't have sex then your not pregnant duh|`|26c54737441cd24a8622c120912fe9b4aa	Are you pregnant as a result of heavy petting? It's unlikely.  The man would have to have his ejaculate on his hands, and even then you're going to have to have the timing within the ideal 3-4 day window in a 28 day cycle.    Your body, however, will stop a menstrual cycle if faced with stress.  Your paranoia about a looming pregnancy could do that.  Cycles can also stop as a result of other quite serious medical conditions.    Do yourself a favor and get a test done, or in the very least speak with a doctor.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	Maybe you should do some research.

Ys3weA2Zaa	It is a huge decision; your life will never, ever be the same again.  I have a four month old and now I know why people told me that you can never be prepared.  So to some degree you do have to go from your gut instincts.  But it is equally important to think through issues of finance and childcare and opinions about parenting styles.  I enjoy and value my career but have decided that it will be there in five years or so; more important to me now is being with my baby to experience his changes every day.  Unfortunately, there's no easy answers to your questions because people value different things.  In short, I went from my gut instincts only after I was sure that my husband and I were financially stable enough to be the kind of parents we wanted to be- with me staying at home for a few years.  Then I can continue with my career; I don't think this is a decision I will regret.  The job will be there after I have 2 kids.  The kids will be changing every single day.  Good luck with your studies.|`|4bedkpvLaa	The sanctity of marriage does it still exists today? There has been alot of controversy about couples making the decision to wed or not.In the 1950's it was basically shunned upon to "shack up" with someone before marriage and in most cases those that did such an act would be disowned by their family members.    Then came the 1960's an era of free love and sex, a hippy generation,many people had several partners and it brought on a whole new way of thinking into the realm of what was accepted in society.    Through the late 1980's and early 1990's many woman strived for the independency in the working fields as well as in their relationships.The thought of marriage was starting to seem unimportant to many,while there is that constant need for companionship the idea to still have that freedom seemed to be just as appealing.Why get married,would it ruin a good thing?    I spoke with several of my friends and a few family members about this issue and their thoughts on it.    " I believe the benefits of living together is a cheaper and a more independent way for many.It doesn't mean that you don't love the person that you are with just because you don't choose to marry them,you shouldn't have to have legal documents to prove how you feel about one another"    "Marriage is strictly a choice of the individuals,marriage takes alot of give and take,I hope to eventually get married and make that commitment and if I am able to do that sensibly then I should be able to accept anything else that might occur in the relationship sensibly and whatever happens to keep my respect and dignity intact"    " I have been on both sides of this debate, I have been married before,divorced,living with someone and now am remarried again,after a divorce it's hard to put that trust in someone else and you don't just want to jump right into another relationship that in your mind might fail.I feel that if you are committed to someone and your love is strong enough and you feel that it is going to be something that both of you benefit from as a couple then you should get married but if you are not sure then don't,it is much easier to walk away without the legal ties."
ii0C0tfXaa	I was in a similar situation, luckily he actually grew up and changed. He used to lie all the time and i would be very hurt and upset, and had feelings of hate tword him. But your going to have to let those feelings go, they are not healthy for you or the baby. Whats done is done, he has lied and did some very indecent things, but you being angry and having bad feelings is not doing good for anyone in this situation. I am not saying to forgive him, just make him man up and pay child support. Im sure you will be a great mother. I hope you are able to let go of the resentment, and bad feelings. Do not let yourself be miserable because of someone who obviously has no morals, you are better then that.

2PcwdQ6qaa	well from what i have read you are ment to have sex on your ovulation days, female sperm is faster, but ldoes not live as long, male sperm is slower and lives longer so if you wanted i boy it you would be wanting to have sex the day after to ovulation.    hope that helps, good luck and baby dust to you.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	have sex before and after ovulation not during
BWUlksmmaa	This is probably no help at all but I recently read that male sperm are the quickest but die quickly while female sperm swim slower but last longer.  So if you were to get pregnant from the sperm already in your body before ovulation, it is likely to have been a female sperm (as they are sitting there alive while the males have died), if you were to concieve from sperm entering your body after ovulation, likely to be male sperm as they have shot to the front straight into the egg.  How does this help?  Probably doesn't sorry :-( - wonder if there is any theory behind not having sex after ovulation and only up until you are about to ovulate????  Blimey, it sounds ridiculous doesn't it, ah well, thought I'd share with you anyway.  good luck.|`|WO7WAP19aa	Hey bub, I also already have a little boy that is nearly 3! & i always think all the time that i want my 2nd child to also be a girl this time, it would mean soooooo much to me & i so badly want one for so many reasons! anyway.. to increase your chances of conceiving a girl, have sex ''Missionary Position'' DONT have sex doggy style, because it gives the ''Y'' sperms (boys) a head start it points them directly right on near the cervix & ''Y'' sperms actually swim faster, so thats why you should have sex normally which as i said.. missionary position, also another way to increase a girl is to have sex a few days BEFORE ovulation, reason for this is because ''Y'' sperms die quicker than the ''X'' sperms (girls) swim slower but LIVE longer, so if you were to have sex before ovulation & not right on.. when ovulation does come there would be only ''X'' sperms left to fertilize the egg.. & all the ''Y'' sperms would have all died off, does that make sense? so do you get what im saying? to cut along story short. . . . ''Y'' sperms swim faster but die quicker, where as, ''X'' sperms swim slower but live longer! you can go to google & type in; ''shettles method'' it explains it all there    Good Luck & i hope we both conceive a BabyGirl :)))) x X x|`|xwMWfuBTaa	Shettles method.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Normally I am one of those really annoying people who say 'it's not a sticker collection, try for a baby not a specific gender', but I suspect you're as hard-headed as me and I'll get a firm telling off for this! lol  Also, I think after 4 boys, it's fair to want a girl...  There is something called the Shettles method if you wanted to research that. It's to do with when you have sex around ovulation time as female sperm apparantly lives longer. Although nothing is guaranteed, it's worth a try!

EGlFhHR2aa	What's the big deal? Every girl has kicked a boy in the nuts! It's part of growing up, and is probably the best way for boys to learn to respect girls.  So long as she doesn't actually crush his nuts, I see nothing wrong with her mother encouraging your daughter's friend to do it. Also your daughter will learn a lot of empowerment by doing the same thing.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	This screams "troll."    However, the answer is that the other parent wouldn't.  Either your daughter (should you have one) was just being randomly mean and made up the information about the other family/mother to get herself out of the spotlight, or you need to report the other mother to CPS.  In either event, you probably don't need a bunch of internet strangers pondering "why" someone would allow that.    Which is why it screams "troll," as I already said.  Particularly in light of the fact that your only other question is about penis size.  Hmmm.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I would suggest talking to the other mother about this.  I mean, I hate seeming like a tattle tale, but if this really is going on, the mother needs to know that it can cause massive amounts of not just pain, but physical harm.  Call her up, have some references about the physical damage that can cause, and just check out whats really going on.  For all you know, your daughter or her friend are just blowing smoke about doing it in front of the mom, or the mom may not realize the physical medical risks in doing that.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I have come to believe that we live in a sick world. where it is ok to kick a guy/boy in the privates and laugh...    had it been the other way around and every time your daughter made your son made he pinched your daughter boobs, everyone would be out raged.. he would be labeled a pervert.. BUT because it is the other way around, not that many will do anything about it..    You are very good to tell your daughter that what did was WRONG.. you also need to tell her that the other mother is WRONG in telling her daughter to do that..she is too young to understand that it could do severe damage to your son.. but she can understand how much in trouble she will get for doing it..      Do not deal with it lightly,  she needs to know how very very wrong it is,,|`|547Ln6rNaa	Lady Catherine is right about that, this is one of those things that we accept one way round but it outrages us the other. If we saw a woman slap a man round the face everyone makes a "ooooh!" noise and wonders what he did to her, if we see a man slap a woman in the face, they call the police and report him, or intervene and beat him.    Abuse is abuse. Unless he is attempting to attack or rape her, no woman should be doing this to a man (or boy).    The friends mom is really, really wrong and I bet she's had some bad experience with men and has concluded that all women are victims that need to fight back and all men are evil and just waiting for their chance to hurt women. I'd keep your kids away from that family, and might even go as far as reporting suspected abuse on their seven year old. Is the mother also hurting him in the genitals when she is cross with him??|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I would go so far as to not allow your daughter to see or speak to her daughter again.  That is completely wrong.  Sit down with the girls' mother and talk to her, explain to her that her daughter is putting her son in extreme physical pain and it's wrong and considered abuse and neglect if she does nothing about it.    And no, tammytam, not everyone has kicked a guy in the balls.  Those of us who have a little more class than that still exist, thanks.

The child is going to be yours forever, that doesn't mean you need to brand them with your name.... give them something that can be their own, a simple and classic name, like Jack may be just that to you, but as your child grows and becomes a unique little human he will come to define "Jack" and the name that you found no significance in before, will forever be emotionally bound to you, maybe as much as you now feel bound to giving your baby your name....who knows?

Sometimes, even with a first baby, the baby wont actually engage until the start of labour, but it's more commonly a few weeks before birth.  Now... what do you mean by turn around to button? Is the baby facing the wrong way? If so, get on your hands and knees and rock back and forth - and do this regularly. It will help the baby position well. Unless the baby is breech, I see no reason why she will want a scan.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes some babies like mine don't engage until labor actually starts.I am 40wks today (yay) and my baby is still not engaged.|`|Sjqgk9r6aa	i am 38 weeks and babies head aint engaged yet so no need to worry.
0VHolTVEaa	My son is 11 months now and got his first tooth at 6 months. Dont worry though, every baby is different. Some babies get teeth before others while others can walk and crawl first. Usually babies teethe up until 3 months so dont worry it will come soon. Your lucky she doesnt cry and have symptons. If she does try bonjela and cold teethers|`|4MjSgjAAaa	my son got his first tooth at 6 months three weeks and has now got 4   all babies are different and some can be born with teeth some like my cousin have to get help he had to get his gums lanced for his teeth to come through but that was only because he was 1 1/2 and in really bad pain. about the symptoms my son has never had any symptoms he hasn't even cried through pain he just shouted a lot lol|`|VClxXNs3aa	my girl is 10 months and no teeth yet!!|`|yU7urgLxaa	We have twins now 16 one had teeth at 9months the other was 13 months|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	at four months but it didnt come tho till 7mths.......dont worry i no a baby who didnt cut her frist tooth till now and she is almost 15months|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son was early. Teething from birth and 4 teeth by 4 months old.  Then my daughter showed no teething signs (for her first 4 teeth - believe me, she has had them for the other 12 she has got in so far!) and all of a sudden around 9.5 months old she got 2 one week then 2 the next.  I know people though who's babies didn't get them until just after their first birthday.|`|LQnKhiVMaa	they will come when they are ready lol... my daughters teeth came through very early and at 13 months her molars have just started errupting all over the place.. it is pure hell, sleepless nights, moaning myrtle (as we have renamed her), she wont eat, she wants undevided attention and is a pain up the butt.... love her to pieces tho, and couldnt do without her x x the health visitor even said it was early for them to be there until she looked herself and shut her trap hole, my teeth didnt start to come through until after i was one because my mum chuckles about it, all babies are different and they all develop at different times x x    when they do come thro, u will prob find they come a few at a time... poor little things x|`|jXtbb11Haa	You are a lucky one.     My little one has been teething since 3 months (still no teeth yet though, just lots of pain)|`|LmgDTXTlaa	my daughter was just 4 months when she cut her first 2 teeth. but she has been fast at almost everything the little monkey could sit unaided at 5 months, pull herself to standing at 6 months, crawled at 6 months and now at 7 months is letting go of furniture trying to walk off on her own. she's cheeky with it all too.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	My daughter got to just before her first birthday without getting any teeth.  I asked the doctor about it, and he said not to worry unless she got to be fifteen months old and still had no teeth.   She had a tooth or two at just about a year old, and then the rest came in without much notice.|`|0ac97caf2f92395a30dfa92e2b780b66aa	Mine did when he turned one infact on his birthday, with time yours will too.  All children cut teeth at different ages so some day you little girl will.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	3 teeth all at the same time at 9 months   1 more at 11 months  1 more at 11.5 months    She may cut more than one at the same time like my daughter.  I think she's lucky to have had no teething symptoms yet.|`|n8qfvIZfaa	my daughter cut her 1st tooth at 9.5 months, she is 11 months now and has all 4 of her front teeth, all babies are different, my friends baby didnt cut her 1st tooth until 11.5 months. I wouldnt worry about it, just enjoy the peace and quiet as its hell, my daughter wouldnt eat or sleep and she was a constant misery, bursting into tears everytime i left the room and screaming until she was purple, once the tooth was through she went back to normal!Although i think shes maybe cutting another so we have to go through it all again lol|`|Vam2QMBPaa	My daughter got her first tooth at 6mths.  She is now 14mths and has 11 teeth - 4 central incisors, 4 lateral incisors and 3 1st molars.|`|FwM5hMKgaa	my eldest son didnt get no teeth till he was 14 months old! my youngest son was 12 months when he got his. apparently the longer they take to come the better the teeth! not sure if its true, i was so worried with my eldest that i took him to the dentist and doctors! they both said its ok.  as for the teething symptoms some brilliant babies sail through without a thing!     hope this helps and puts your mind at rest, im sure they will be here soon.|`|n4BvSMoxaa	My little one starting teething at 3mnths but her first tooth didn't cut through until she was 7mnths and the 2nd came right after the first one. All children are different. Her teeth will come through when they are ready to.
WO7WAP19aa	You are definitely pregnant, the reason why you got a negative (which was called a false negative) is cause when you tested, your urine hCG levels were obviously really low at the time in that urine, or your urine was diluted, meaning you had fluid intake before you tested & caused it to be a false negative.. & when you tested positive would of been when your urine wasnt diluted & had well enough hCG in it for it to become a positive, meaning you got false negatives cause your hCG in your urine is still low & taking some time to build up, also keep in mind that the FMU (first morning urine) is well concentrated & has the highest levels of hCG in it with your first pee. . . . so test again in the morning or something & i can gaurantee you it will show up another definite positive then! :)))) OR; however, you can go get a hCG blood test done & it will tell you if you are or not & also give you a accurate answer, blood tests are NEVER wrong & are way more sensitive !!! & detect hCG alot quicker than it shows up in the urine!|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Well all the symptoms certainly are those of a pregnant woman  up until a few days ago id of said if it was positive then you was certainly pregnant as i have seen many times that a negative can be false whereas a positive cant be but reading some stories on a moms network turns out a few people have got positive pregnancy tests which were actually false and had been caused by another health issue  I really hope with all my heart this isn't the case for you i know how it feels to lose and long for a baby.  I know it's easier said then done but just try and not get your hopes up until the doctor has confirmed it  I wish you lots of luck|`|qfCRWAw0aa	Hey hunny!     Woohoo you are pregnant sweetie, doesnt matter if you got some negs! You got 3 positives. You dont get false positives but you do get faulse negatives!     Aww congratulations sweetie, hope you have a fantastic pregnancy!     xxx|`|9ALwHYZaaa	I dont think diarrhoea is a sign, i think you become more constipated if anything due to the increased absorption of water from your food.    If you have had bloods done today, usually results will be back tomorrow afternoon, so give them a ring then if they havent already said.      you are having alot of symptoms and if the positives are showing up WITHIN the time limit then its a positive. BUT if the positive appears AFTER the time limit then its a negative.    The symptoms can be other things and so you shouldnt think your pregnant just because of this. Only a positive result determines if your pregnant. Just remember not to get too carried away until you know for sure.
dfSc0AbGaa	I think it pretty much comes down to the maturity of the adults involved. If BF and his ex are very amicable then that would make it easier. If they are not on happy terms then I would by all means not meet them all at the same time.    Depending on the age of the children (as well as how mature the adults act) it may seem weird. If you think it would be awkward for the kids in any way whatsoever (ask your BF this) then don't do it.     With all of that said, though, you seem to have doubts so play it safe and meet the kids first.     I hope it goes well for you!|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	I'm not a professional either, but that sounds like it would be super awkward for everyone involved. I would suggest holding off on meeting everyone all at once as it could lead to bad feelings for not just the children but for the mother as well.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	I'm not a professional, but my husband had 2 kids when I met him.  And I am so glad that I met everyone seperatly.  Not just for the kids, but for my sake as well.  It is very stressful meeting someone elses children.  You don't automatically love someone else children the way you do your own.  And meeting the mother can be super hard as well.  These are 2 sets of people that you should handle seperatly for a while till you feel more comfortable.|`|UVPPmawnaa	My husband and I both had kids from previous marriages when we got together.  I never "officially" met his ex nor did I ever "formally introduce" him to mine.  We planned an outing for our kids to meet and get to know each other when it became apparent that we were going to be a lasting thing. However, there was no set meeting of our exes.  I don't think it's necessary.  You're not really going to be a part of HER life, just the children's.  She has no choice but to respect her ex's (your boyfriend's) judgment about you, just as he would have no voice in who SHE became involved with. And yes, it would be very awkward for you, her, and the kids...do something fun & light with him and his children for your first meeting.  Just smile and be polite when you have to be around his ex.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I agree, it would probably be a bit too much stress for you to do both at once. Imagine having to be critically analyzed by the mother with the way you behave around her children before she's even gotten to know you. I would suggest something a little less confrontational to begin with, perhaps just the kids first. Or even just the mother first so that she doesn't have the chance to feel jealous if the kids like you. That way when they go home saying that you're nice she's already had the chance to assess that for herself.
VMASMHX6aa	Having a m/c can really mess up your cycles. I had one last July, I got a period 5 weeks later. I then had a 50 day cycle! I usually have a 30 day cycle.  I also had a m/c last November and didn't get a period for 9 weeks. I then had a 23 day cycle!  It does take a while for your body to sort itself out.    To be honest, I've been to the doctor about the same matter and found them to be really unhelpful.|`|2PcwdQ6qaa	i had a mmc on christmas day, im now 9 days over due with 2 negative tests. im not getting my hopes up, i have had 3 mmc in a row now so i think thats me done.    good luck baby dust to you hunni
wP480B6Waa	you should call right away before it gets severe/worse. It could be more than it seems. My son had the same thing from his daycare and I had to put him on antibioics.|`|AA11840819	First he is adorable. I have a 6 month old granddaughter who just got over a bad cold,  If he starts running a fever he needs to see a doctor for sure.  As long as he is himself and playful he is probably ok.  Should he start pulling at his ears or if he gets too congested  I would take him.  Abby, my granddaughter had a ear infection as well from the cold and she did run a fever. They told us to give her tylenol and gave her an antibiotic for the ear infection.    Take care of that little doll.|`|um29wkUPaa	I never called for a cough. Tis the season.  But call if it's going to make you more comfortable.  Especially if you're a first time mom.  Nothing with put your mind at ease more than experience.      Watch for escalation, vomiting or a thick, phlegmy mucous and keep him hydrated.  Or call if it lasts more than a few days.  No milk with a phlegmy cough!    I'd call on the sleep issues.  He could have a pain, discomfort or digestive issue that's keeping him awake.|`|DkP14oJaaa	I would take him to the doctors asap.  because coughs can get really bad. ;[|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	i think it would be best to go to the dr now..you dont want him to develope fever. they will just give him a little medicine.|`|pDRAciBnaa	hi,holly has the same thing,she also is eating/sleeping and playing normally....we did take her to the docs and she has a chest infection and is now on antibiotics!! so just to be safe i would take him,also at night use karvol drops in his bed,this helped holly last night!! hope he gets well soon.|`|576a5e5060bb09bd6c667591037775e8aa	If he is playing and eating like normal and does not have a fever or green snot comming out of his nose then I would not bother taking him to the doctor.  If he is not sleeping properly because of his cold then you could go to the chemist and get some cough mixture, however these are not really recommended for children under the age of two.  I use a product called tixylix, it is a Eucalyptus chest rub that you rub on the childs chest and / or back every night before they go to bed and the vapours helop them to breathe easier.    if you are at all worried then go and see the Dr, but if it is viral which sounds like then there is no mediaction that can be given.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Its just a cold, the doctor won't be able to do anything for it more than yo can. Don't worry about it, the worst part of a cold lasts about 3 days.
0VHolTVEaa	My 11 month is the same, he keeps having colds on and off. I realised it was a few reasons, firstly the detergent i was his clothes in, secondly the house wasnt aired as its cold here i keep windows clothes and germs are stuck in doors, also keeping floors clean. I hope this helps, i know its not easy especially when their sleep is interuppted. Poor baby, hope he gets well soon|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I think I would be looking for another doctor who takes my concerns seriously.    Things to try in the meantime.  Get a cool mist humidifier for his bedroom and run it every night.  The extra moisture in the air will help loosen the stuff in his lungs and help get it out of there.      Think about a small air purifier for his room also.  This very well could be allergy related and giving him the cleanest air possible to sleep in might just help.    He could be allergic to anything, however, I wouldn't suspect dairy with a cough.  I'd suspect dust, pet dander, a scent from a fabric softner, laundry detergent, an air freshener.  Change as many products as you can back to unscented or hypoallergenic.  Start with the ones that he comes in direct contact with such as laundry detergent, fabric softener, cleaners used and see if he doesn't improve.  Improvement will be slow because you are looking for a needle in a haystack almost.      If he goes to a sitter or daycare, ask what products they use around the children and look for possible allergens there.    Get a vacuum with HEPA filtration.  This helps clean the air as you sweep.  After you get the new vacuum, sweep every day for about a week.  I got a Bissell Healthy Home with sealed HEPA on it and I am quite impressed.  My one grown son has allergies to cats and we have cats.  He used to sneeze when he came to visit but since I got the new sweeper, he does not sneeze at all.    Good luck!  And give the little guy a hug!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i think you need to find a different doctor! fair enough they dont know everything, but they shouldnt stop seeing a patient until they have a proper diagnosis and working treatment.  It could have been due to the damp problems in your other place, and maybe he just needs a little more time to get over it! If they think that it is asthma, ask about a nebulizer- my daughter had to use one at 6 months when she had a bad chesty cough, and it helped her so much and bought up all the yucky bits and just made her so relaxed!  .|`|GfphOIdOaa	Erm, doctors haven't diagnosed what the problem is? They just hand a 10 month old child some medication and send you away? Maybe you should visit a real doctor and have him find the reason for the cough. It could be an allergy and they should be able to determine that by doing some tests.|`|AdKYCQI9aa	This could be a far fetched suggestion, but ask your doc if he has considered whooping cough, my son had it, sounds similar, but i doubt it, cause it's rare these days|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I would have his lungs checked again.  By a different doctor.  Babies are extremely venerable to mold spores in the air and their lungs can aspirate.  ( any body's can but babies are more at risk )  This can make them very sick.    I seen an extreme makeover home edition and a guy had suddenly died after having cold/flu like symptoms because he was remodeling his house that had a mold problem.    I'm NOT trying to scare you or even saying that this is the problem.  I'm only looking out because when we moved into our house a couple years ago the bathroom off my bedroom smelled a little moldy and we noticed a crack in the tub.  The people before us had been using the tub even tho it was cracked and the water was leaking down underneath and it grew mold.  You couldn't see it but it was musky.  Anyway I had the mold removed because it can be very dangerous ( some of it )  And I had just had my daughter.  ( I never cared b4 this but when the baby came it was an emergency issue ).    So maybe it's just because of the winter months but please have him checked again.|`|xCpfFTZ6aa	GIVE YOU'R BABY A HOT WARTER BOTEL AND A HUG AND THEN LET HIM GO TO SLEEP !!  IF THAT FALLS U SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTER AGAIN AND TELL THEM STRAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SaU9i4Qbaa	aww poor baby x  i wouldn't say that it was a dairy problem as you wouldn't get those kind of symptoms. all you can do it keep him on medication. my cousin (11 months ) came to stay with us and he had a bad cold , he had it for quite a while to , its just one of those colds that are buggers and take forever to get rid of . x|`|fjZeVLOQaa	do u think he might have teeth coming through my 2nd son had a chesty cough for a few months around 1 year of age and it was his teeth,as soon as his teeth were through he as fine,goodluck|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	I dont think dairy would casue that kind of reaction but it is always worth asking the doctor (im not a proffesional) but my son was like this for ages, the inhaller didnt work, we got a spray that eliminated dust mites to be on the same side as well as antibiotics but nothing helped. It turned out he was allergic to our smaller terrier dog. (our big one is a non malter) so we rehomed him and it soon cleared up within weeks so was most deffinately an allergic reaction to the dog hairs, do you have a pet? if not a pet then I would really look for other things he could be reacting to!      add- id like to add that his father has an allergy to cats and was also having to live on antihistamines when we had the little dog, the doctor went through our health and any allergies before pointing out that the dog was most likely to blame. which it turned out he was|`|RzYePezkaa	I had this problem with my 5 yr old and 2 yr old we moved 5 months ago and they had this cough.2 chest x-rays and 5 doctors visits later it turned out to be pneumonia it is gone now but we also use a cool mist humidifier in their room at night to help them|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	My nephew is 7 months old and he has similar problems. He also has times where he can hardly breathe.    He has been given inhalers as they do believe that he does have asthma but they do not really seem to work.  He was then diagnosed with bronchitis.    Recently they sent him to hospital for a chest xray. This shows that he has a shadow on his lung which they believe is because he has mild pneumonia.    So now along with his inhalers he is also on antibiotics. Hopefully they will sort him out.    It is worth going back to your doctor again. They should be able to advise more or send him for further tests.    Asthma also runs in my family. I have it. My brothers had it when they were younger and grew out of it.  My daughter has just been diagnosed and she is nearly 3.  I also have 2 nieces with it.    Good luck|`|68135d4fd26905426c359b357cc084deaa	hi my 10 month old had just got over a cold bad cough etc and now has another bad chesty cough, a few people have said teething as his 2nd toth has just come thru.  we also live in a damp house and are moving next week due to this. im like u i cant put my finger on the problem
CnGR2xeoaa	He's probably feeling cold and covering his head gives him extra heat. It shouldn't cause any problems but if you want him to stop try finding him a light stocking cap he can wear while he is sleeping.   He'll probably stop when the weather warms up a bit.|`|us1ca2qIaa	He's a young child, he likes to try new things and be different, or his ears are cold. Sounds normal to me.|`|145RUNQHaa	Hi!he s not the only one i go to sleep that way too and i am nearly thirty!don t worry no harm will come to him as it s just a way to get himself off to sleep and once you ve moved his blankets away from his face i doubt he will keep putting them back over his face.it is do with cold sometimes but i do it because it makes me feel safe and secure.(bless me!)|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I do this sometimes, if a light is bothering me or if my head is cold.  It's not a problem if you're checking on him, and he'll probably grow out of it.    I think he's doing it to keep the most warm, since it's been so cold at night.|`|jchCJZxTaa	well there is no explanation maybe he like it to be really dark;  i would try to get him in to  a different routine.   maybe give him a teddy bear to hug, or tell hi blankets have to be kept off his head!!    blankets over the head for a child can be pretty dangerous when you think about it! try taking to him!|`|AA10529334	It could be he is cold so he covers all up and then falls asleep that way. Breathing under the blanket warms up the bed.    Since he is still putting himself to bed and not having any problems I would not think it is that he is scared. Some kids maybe but it doesnt sound like that in this case. That would be another reason to put the blanket over your head.|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Your little guy is most probably doing this as a comfort thing.  Both my older children would do this when they were younger and my 11 week old pulls her bed sheet up to chin at sleep time.  I found this concerning also, so I went out brought comforter blankies for my children. Their a tiny little blankie no bigger than a tea towel with lovely soft velvet on one side and satin on the other with a teddy or bunny head in the center so they can hold.  My two older children who are now 8 and 5 still keep theirs in their bedside drawers and our new edition now sleeps holding onto bunny ears, rather than her cot sheets!!  You can buy them from all good nursery stores.|`|ZL92cpPJaa	His ears of nose is probably getting cold.  For now you could buy some soft earmuffs or something to keep in the heat.  If it's his nose there are less options, but if you keep checking on him, he'll be fine.|`|a6ed7acf264e14fc00a9f345b6f76010aa	I'm 14, and I do that, in my sleep, I always wake up with the covers over my head. I don't know why I do that, it's just something I've been doing for a long time. I don't know how it can be fixed. Hopefully we can grow out of it or something
nBlSS6HUaa	At my daughters 18 mond visit she was 32 1/4 inches, and 22 pounds. And I just had her at the dr and she was 24 pounds, and 33 1/2 inches. ANd she just turned 22 months on the 25th of January. She has always been 'little' for weight around the 20%. But for height she was around 90% or so...but she has slowed way down!! lol Which is completely normal! Her DR gives a handout with each well baby visit, and it says between 18-24 months 'growth slows down, and even the appetite may slow down, but continue to offer fruits, vegis, and milk at all meals. And don't force any food on your child. A healthy growing child will eat when they are hungry'. As well as growing.   So I would say she is completely normal and ok. As for her wearing 12 mo. pants. LOL my daughter can wear 9-12 month pants...but they would be short on her! She has NO bottom, therefore the 24mo fall off unless they are adjustable waist! Which you can find at K-mart, Childrens place, and Gymboree.    Good Luck!|`|hieQHR0daa	I think you need to tell your mother-in-law that you are finding her comments on your daughters height disturbing. Tell her that you love your daughter as she is and you are sure that she does too. It isn't helpful to hear these comments repeated and it is upsetting you so you would be grateful if she would just drop the subject.  After that if the topic comes up again, just say you thought she understood that you aren't prepared to discuss this anymore.  Hopefully she will stop.    Children grow at individual rates and can have growth spurts at any stage in their development. As long as your child is well and happy, and her developmental milestones are met there is no need to worry about her,|`|AA11795652	Up until my daughter was about 2 1/2 years old, she was always below or on the bottom of all the growth scales.  When she a bit younger, my husband asked the doctor if our daughter was going to be a "midget" (forgive the politically incorrect term).  My daughter is now 4 years old and is the same size and sometimes even taller than her peers.  I am also 5'3" and my husband is half Japanese so we have some short family on both sides.  My son is only 9 months old and seems tall and big to me since my daughter was always so petite.  She also wore 12 month old clothes even when she was almost 2 years old.  My daughter is currently 37 inches tall and she's 4 years old so your daughter seems tall to me because when my daughter was 2, she was much, much shorter.  For example, when she was walking around and was about 15-16 months old, people thought she was 6-9 months old.
jchCJZxTaa	maybe a theme,  even for just a family birthday party a theme is great, maybe a fairy or something party.  or you could try games such as, pin the tail on eeyore, or pin the honey to pooh bear - just make up games to suit the little girl, or theres games like tiggi for a back yard game!    depends on the girl!    and happy birthday!!  - to her!    hope i helped !!|`|foWmh4Ohaa	get like a small bouncy castle!

Here are some nice tips and ideas u can apply and have a great party,    Most children of this age love dressing up, so keep a box of dressing up clothes handy. Balloons are great fun, but the noise of them bursting may scare more timid tots. Remove burst ones quickly, for safety's sake.     Simple but structured games with clear instructions, like Ring o' Roses, Simon Says and dancing to music are great fun. Action rhymes go down well -- or consider a short story after food to calm them down for home time.     If you have prize games, like Pass the Parcel, then you need to ensure every child receives something to avoid tears -- at this age, they don't understand rules too well! They'll love to make a noise, so blowers and horns will create great excitement. Outdoors, a bouncy castle may work well, but will need a large garden space and plenty of supervision. In warm weather, a paddling pool and garden toys will create all the fun that's needed, but, again, spot-on supervision is needed (and plenty of shade from the sun).
0sJsTN83aa	I largely agree with you.  Why are we sending back children to families where they are terrified?  The laws are not set up for the right interested, but rather the cheapest route for the state.  The states sees it as "well, we have to pay you to be a foster parent, we don't have to pay the real parents" (and yes, this happens a LOT, that's why my  mentally disturbed uncle was always released from asylums on multiple occasions, because it was more expensive for the state to keep him there).    I think it's high time that we hold these parents accountable, and not just set up the laws to help them keep their rights, no matter how many things they may have done horribly wrong.  My sister had a foster child who was hospitalized twice because he was beaten so hard by his father - the state gave him back both times!  Then the guy ran off and left the child alone in a store, never came back.  It's insane, and we need some new legislation that will actually advocate the child's best interests instead of these half-assed plans to remove children only to put them right back in the same abusive situation!|`|2wyDALHgaa	Well, the social worker is essentially right.  Legally it doesn't matter what the child is fed as long as they are fed and it's deemed to be nutritious and sufficient.  If all they get is mac and cheese with hot dogs, technically that meets the legal standard.      And as far as spanking goes, at least here in Canada it's been deemed legal.  Section 43 of the Criminal Code states:  Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.    The views expressed by the social worker regarding the child "always want[ing] to be with their natural families, no matter what..." is a view held by many including many people here.  While I agree that it may be the view of most children I do agree that it's not always in their best interest and that someone needs to step in and make an objective decision on their behalf.  Someone needs to separate emotion and "want" from the process and determine what is best.  Ask any child if they want to go home and they will say yes.  It's only natural and understandable.  They don't comprehend the consequences if the situation is not safe for them.  Ask a child what they want to eat for dinner, ice cream or a nutritious meal and they will normally choose the ice cream.  Once they get tired of it they will go for the meal.  We don't have that same luxury of a second or third chance when it comes to a child wanting to go back to a neglectful or abusive situation.  I'm not saying they want the abuse or the neglect.  I'm just saying that they are not of a mature enough mind to have their head override their emotions.  Heck, even adults in similar situations are the same way or we wouldn't have men and women returning to abusive domestic situations either.      Speaking strictly of abusive or neglectful situations I don't think the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction in all cases but I'm sure there are just as many situations where it has swung too far in the direction to return a child as it has swung in the other direction sometimes to not return another child.  Mistakes happen both directions and we need to find a way to lessen those mistakes.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Yes, when there is neglect, etc. the child's safety is indeed in need of questioning. However, in my case, my biological parents could have cared for me, they just did not feel they had the proper knowledge, and they lied about a lot.     Anyway, I was a very ill infant and at the year of one they were given a couple of chances to take me back but they did not want me, so that is there problem.    Otherwise, if it is possible to help the biological mother, father or any biological family get help and teach them to raise a biological child by all means do it.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	O.K sorry but this place has heavy "family preservationist" supporters and you won't be supported with your views.    I do partially agree with you but unless the abuse is seriously severe i too support families are better off together and we remember that different family has different values and the social worker is right in saying that.   For some one light spanking is"abuse" and for others its disclipining. I know as most families in my country hold that view and we don't have social services jumping in. I have read of a case where a mom and her kids were taken away for negligence after she had left her children home alone and gone to work. Some people would be horrified , i see a poor woman trying to support her family in a difficult situation and feel for her when her kids were taken away. I read of a case when a grandma was arrested when a T.V fell on a toddler and the child was seriously injured. I see that as an accident that can happen to ANYONE and wrong for CPS to call it "neglicence" and take away her child and place him in foster care.  And another incident when in the kitchen the mother was cooking and the hot water fell on her kid when she was not around for a while and the child was taken away from for "negligence". I did not see it as negligence but an "accident".    And then there was a case of a toddler that walked off and was found by the busy interstate in the winter with some bare clothes on his back. The police had to break open the door of the house. This woman was stoned and her other infant was in a diaper that had poop days old. That is serious "negligence" !!!! Even in that case that woman needed help so that she could be given treatment and the kids should go back if she was deemed fit.    I think different situations warrants a different approach. Most kids in Foster care could be better of in natural families eventually. Unless the abuse was severely physical IMO.    As for "children want to be with their natural families".........stick around here and you'll learn from adult adoptess thats a fact too.    ETA- http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/11/stories/...  This happened in my country. In this case where the father tried to drown his daughter and was saved. I would like to see his butt in jail and his child removed. But it won't happen in my country. Also in an interview on T.V this 6 year old was missing her father (absconding) and wanted him back.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You raise a very good point.    I have been told that the system would rather the child go back to the birth parents if at all possible.  Whether the child wants to go back doesn't matter.  However, if the parents are deemed unfit again or something equally bad happens to endanger the child I don't think the parents get another chance.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	"Do you think the pendulum has perhaps swung too far the opposite way, and our emphasis now is placed so firmly on family preservation that in the process we are condemning children to lives that we ourselves would be miserable in?"    This paragraph prompted me to answer...    I have often thought about what you said in this part of your question. Because Aust has a lot of focus in this area.    However there have been cases in this day and age, in Aust of women who do want to put their baby up for adoption and social services won't let them sign relinquishment papers until months later. Some women have had to beg social services to do it... (I have spoken to a foster mother very experienced in adoption placements, so my information isn't its not rumours, )Or they parent for a year and discover they really couldn't do it. Then the child ends up in foster care and is adopted by a family anyway and the child's bio mother goes through even more trauma. So it can go to far the other way, to the point that a chchild's life is put in danger just so they can live with biological family.      I'm all for family preservation, and I often said it here, and I feel it should be tried first or at least give the biological mother time to work out if this what she wants.  (Without the AP's involved and then getting hurt because she changed her mind, so much pressure in that kind of system where the child goes home with the AP's while she thinks about it.)     Family preservation shouldn't be forced just to meet social services or other activist groups (anti or pro adoption) agenda. The it stops being about the kids- and only about the needs of birth parents and adoptive parents again.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	You are absolutely correct.  The state governments have determined that it is much more cheaper to return the child to the home if they are "safe".  There are guidelines and criteria that has to be met but it sounds like you would be absolutely shocked to find out just how low those standards are.  You must remember that it's really the state's responsibility for all our children.  You'd probably also be horrified if a parent fed their children McD's everyday, right?  But they're not starving.  If it's cheaper to buy them a .99 burger to get them fed, they may have to do it.  Every parent cannot afford bacon, eggs, oatmeal, toast, orange juice and milk for breakfast like we can.  So we have to suck it up and realize that "substandard care" is a matter of opinion.  Ours doesn't count. We have to do what we can for the children within our control.  Here in my city one popular children's home that I volunteered at was forced to close and surrender all the children (some who'd been there for years)  to foster homes.  WHY?  1. New Governor who determined it's cheaper to pay the foster parent than to keep children's homes going.  It's a cruel cruel world for some.  Write your representatives. I do.

r7q8LW7Aaa	Of course it's not right - they will allow fertility treatment in people that age, but they can't care for their own grandchildren?  What is wrong with the world.|`|x647LeB2aa	I don't think it is too old.    My aunt is caring for three of her grandchildren for similar reasons.  She is 53, her husband is 56 and the children are 16, 12 and 7.    My sister-in-law has recently had twin girls.  She is 48 and her husband is 55.  This makes her older than the grandmother in your question.  If we believe all we read, Social Service's logic would say they should take away her babies too!    However, this story is probably just another headline grabbing media thing as I know with my aunt everything was done to keep the children 'within the family' and together.  I think the reason this has made the news is simply down the fact the couple adopting the children are gay.    The newspapers usually report just half the story and I guess health will be the issue, not age.|`|AA12279950	Believe me, as a foster carer, I can assure you there's a lot more to this case than meets the eye.  If grandparents are capable of looking after their grandchildren there would be NO intervention by social services - the grandparents are clearly infirm.  They didn't object to the children being put into care - they objected to the gay couple who now look likely to adopt them.  Please don't sensationalise this sad case any more than necessary, there are two little lives involved here and they've already had far too much heartache.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	This is the most disgusting story I ever heard of the abuse of power from our social services.     I am a 44 year old woman who has a 4 year old daughter, this lady is just 2 years older than me. How can she be considered too old, her body is most likely still capable of producing children. That is God/nature's way of telling us a woman is still capable of raising children. The poor kids in this case will have their childhoods destroyed, all the love and trust they have with their family will be shattered.    The truth behind this story seems to be that the social workers are desperate to fill their quota for same sex couples adopting children. These kids are to be forcibly removed from their grandparents and placed with 2 men.     If I were the Grandmother I would go into hiding., There are many many people in this country that would help them to hide out - me for one.  The following link is the newspaper article:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...|`|LmgDTXTlaa	It depends on health. if they are not in a fit enough state to look after the child then maybe after all avenues of help have been exhausted may it be appropriate for the children to be taken into care. but not soley on the grounds of age. As long as they are capable of caring from them it is the wrong decision to part them.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	i can't see how age or health is an issue surely they are not both too ill to look after the children. if the children are happy and healthy what is the problem.   it's like social services saying you are unfit to look after your own children if you have a disability. there are parents with severe disabilities out there but it doesn't make them any less of a parent because of it in fact you usually find they are better parents because they are aware of their disability and work even harder with their child to show everyone it makes no difference.  social services have not got a clue. instead of helping the children that really need it they disrupt the families of happy, healthy children.   they should give these grandparents more support with the children they could have let them go into care at the start but they didn't.  if they had asked for them to be put into care social services would have run a mile they have no logical actions  it's beyond me|`|1h9DYByQaa	i think its wrong that the children should be taken away from the grandparents because of there age..    if this is so then they should be taking children away from all parents when they reach 59 and 49.. ludicrus it really is!     mum of 4|`|Gs2FHT3saa	no 59 and 46 is not tat old  special 46.  i think it s wrong    if the r in good heath no problem|`|irLnPW4aaa	59 AND 46 certainly isn't old.  There are a lot of parents who are in the 45-45 age range just having babies, so I would think that this is more a health and circumstances issue than strictly an 'age' issue.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Probably less age and more health.  Those ages are perfectly fine, but if they are not in good enough health to be chasing after children, that could be a problem.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	wow... that's sad. Did they mention the particular health issues? That is not too old at all in my book (heck some people are becoming parents at that age!) but if they are sick then that is another thing all together.

He does seem to not breastfeed as often and I feed on demand but even with my first child who I breastfed for 15 months, I never took away a feed.  Usually, I give the solid and then after offer my breast and let my baby decide how much he wants to nurse.  Sometimes he still nurses a while and other times it's just a little bit.  The formula or breastmilk is still their primary source of nutrition even when eating solids.|`|LmgDTXTlaa	To start with just give a tiny bit of one thing a day. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE MILK YET! try giving your daughter a little food after a bottle at first. I started with baby rice, one spoon a day, then after a week, i started mixing a little pureed fruit in with the rice. once she had the hang of eating from a spoon i started giving 2 'meals' a day, she had fruit in a morning and veg in the afternoon. i then moved on to 3 'meals' a day fruit in a morning, veg around dinner time and veg around teatime. this was when i started giving her her food separate from her bottles, still not substituting though. as she got used to just one fruit or veg at a time i started mixing them, apple and banana for breakfast, sweet potato and carrot for dinner and potato and parsnip for tea, something like that. 2 months after starting weaning my daughter stared having just normal meals, spag bol, cottage pie, things that pureed a little lumpy and now 3 months on we just mash her food. one of the best web site i got advice from was the Cow & Gate website, lots of lovely recipes and also i have an Annabel Karmel baby cookbook, its brilliant for giving you ideas. I make sure i have some portions of my daughters food frozen so that if im in a rush i dont have to cook something and if myself or my husband want something she can't eat yet for tea we always have something that she can eat.    Oh and it was only when my daughter started having proper meals that I started dropping milk feeds. but until a year you need to make sure your daughter has at least 500ml-600ml of baby milk or breat milk a day. it still has lots of useful vitamins in. I use SMA progress|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Babies that age usually don't eat enough to think about getting rid of any of the bottles.      They usually have something like rice cereal with apple sauce for breakfast - and then a "breakfast bottle" (maybe with slightly less formula in it, maybe not, depending on the baby).   Then they may have something like a half jar of warmed baby vegetables and a half jar of fruit for lunch.  Dinner might be the other half of the vegetables and fruit (or a different one).    If she's not an extremely overweight baby, giving her her usual formula  will help make sure she gets at least that much nutrition.      She may stop finishing a bottle here or there; or  you'll otherwise just kind of notice a gradual "phasing out" of all the bottles; but she still needs a good amount of formula.      If she happens to be a particularly heavy-side baby, your doctor may suggest switching her to whole milk instead of formula.|`|qjDxKXENaa	milk should never be stopped. you should always give her milk as usual, so milk in the morning then allow 1-2 hrs then offer a 1 sppon of baby rice mixed with her milk. do this for a week but by the end of the week offer her 2 spoons... once you are up to 4 spoons, start the lunch which is 1 spoon again. she willgo down on the amount of milk she drinks but make sure shedoesnt go down more then 1oz per bottle.

Wait til your scan, and perhaps they can tell you then.|`|9iOHAC41aa	It's believed that if the bpm is 140+ it's a girl. 140- is a boy.

VEEbzc4jaa	I had the 3 year implant and i had no bleeding for 18 months and then for the next 9 months i had about 3 periods and for the last few months i was having 2 small periods a month.     Every woman reacts differently to the implant, my sister had to come off coz she never stopped bleeding.    Its perfectly normal. Look it up on the net and it will tell you all the pros and cons of having the implanon.|`|f7E4FqVfaa	It happens. Count yourself lucky so far, some women bleed the whole time they're on it. A little breakthrough is normal.|`|u87SoOYqaa	I had Implanol before, I had bleeding most of the time, I'd have a period and then spotting until the next period then I'd be fine until the next period and then spotting..........Got it taken out after about 1.5 years (I did give it a chance to settle down) and started something else    I don't know if this affects the working of the implant, but it drove me crazy, I know friends of mine who had no period for about a year, and then had bleeding, I can't remember if it continued or not
I40vnqNyaa	You DO KNOW what they call people who practice the withdrawal method... don't you?  PARENTS..     Its an old joke, but, trust me..   speaking from experience LOL..|`|wENdWT5kaa	No it is not. There is still sperm in pre-ejaculation, which can be released without the guy knowing it.|`|VClxXNs3aa	what do you mean by safe?  like no you wont die from a  guy withdrawing, but it wont protect you very well from pregnancy or diseases.|`|loy04C98aa	Compared to what?      It doesn't protect you from STD's or pregnancy.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	NO  your obviously not ready for sex if you have to ask this ridiculos question    ever heard of pre-***?  no?    google it, you might just learn something|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Not at all...and it is not a method. And since you think it is then maybe you are not ready for sex.|`|u9smZa51aa	as long as you swallow it you cannot get preggers cause its in ur mouth|`|h1lDGNp4aa	Start buying baby clothes and diapers!|`|fcfd19147db60f65269e3a714d3a6e21aa	The with drawl method does not always work. I have 2 children, and used the with drawl method.|`|pW31jMWQaa	NO never, why do you think there are so many Catholics.|`|VxQcErukaa	Certainly not.|`|5LzZYrQnaa	no the only method thats 100% safe is not having sex at all.   even if using birth control pills some can still get pregnant   even using condoms they can rip.|`|RzYePezkaa	nope you could still get pregnant.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	NO|`|XNPGGNMUaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooo|`|VCX36W6Daa	definitely not. better to just use condom then risk it|`|03IFg5u2aa	technically speaking it can go both ways. The "withdrawal" or "pulling out" method is not 100% and typically isnt practiced. the best methods for safe sex are : a. abstinance b. condom c. the pill. or d. b+c. nothing is 100%|`|esdjKGeBaa	Well, so and so... Some liquid is released before ejaculation, and that liquid may contain sperm. So... let's say it's 80% safe (from the point of view of pregnancy, not STDs), but it's risky.|`|rIDZZZnbaa	NO, The only thing that might be safe is a condom|`|xwMWfuBTaa	NO
pwu9xzF8aa	it could be teething! my daughter is up all night when she is teething, and it causes a great deal of problems with her sleeping pattern- and he teeth take up to 3 months to come up.  So it could be teething, or something else could be bothering her.   Does she sleep late in the afternoon? If so, you may need to put her down for a nap in the middle of the day- late morning/early arvo and keep her up until bedtime.    Talk to your community childcare nurse or doctor about sleeping clinics is all fails.  If there is someone close to you, like a parent, sister etc, ask them to watch the baby overnight so you can catch up on some much needed sleep and then tackle the problem refreshed!   have you tried putting her in with you when she wakes? I know a lot of mothers dont like this habit, but my daughter went through a very clingy stage where she wanted to be in our bed at about 3am. after persisting for about a week and losing the rest of the nights sleep, i gave up and put her in with me when she woke up, which saw her sleeping in til 9 or 10 in the morning! It didnt last long, and shes sound through the night in her cot now!  I hope you figure out what is bothering your little one, and get some much needed sleep!!|`|U36GI9FUaa	it might not be any of those things maybe she keeps having nightmares of you.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Is she teething?  That is what is sounds like.  In which case there isn't much you can do other than comfort her, and give her infant Tylenol before bed.  My 21 month old still doesn't sleep through the night, waking up between 3 and 6 times a night. My son didn't consistently sleep through until he got in his last baby tooth at 2 years and 2 months old|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	She may need to be warmer than you think she does.  One of the biggest things that will keep anyone from sleeping soundly is being even a little chilled, but particularly, out-and-out cold.    If she's been left to cry it out she may have also come to associate her bed with being a miserable place.      Most babies need to be reasonably warm (not too hot), with something like a warm temperature in the room, a warm feet-in sleeper, and an undershirt.  Babies that age may not like a completely dark room either, so if there isn't one, a night light and hall light may be a good idea.|`|BDsYZGTqaa	My daughter is only 6 months old and has gone from sleeping all night to waking up twice. How long has she been waking at night for? If it has only started recently it may be a growth spurt?|`|0ac97caf2f92395a30dfa92e2b780b66aa	Well I guess all babies are different some sleep through the night easily while others don't.  My son is one year old and 3 months and he still wakes up twice.    Give yourself some little more time she might start sleeping all through the night.
dxlNwGuWaa	Its normal for the dates to be wrong by up to a week at this early stage.  Not to scare you, but by 6wks 5 days you should have seen the gestational sac, yolk sac and a fetal pole.  At this stage 50% of people see a heartbeat.  If you have all of the above, your pregnancy is classed as viable.  What did they see exactly?  Its highly possible you got your dates wrong.  Unless you track your ovulation, you are most likely wrong, which is why we have dating scans.  Do you have another scan booked for a weeks time? If not contact your EPU.  At 7 weeks 5 days you will be in good stead to know where you stand with this pregnancy.    Good luck    xxxx|`|VClxXNs3aa	3 or 4 weeks off is highly unlikely..........    good luck.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	My first ultrasound said I was 6 weeks but I had already missed 2 periods also I should be 10 weeks now but my belly is huge more like 16 or 20 weeks. I'm not sure if its a mechanical error or if my doctor is an  idiot|`|xwMWfuBTaa	At 6 weeks 5 days they would know that it is viable already.  I'm so sorry :(    They should've seen a gestational sac, a yolk sac, a fetus and a heartbeat all by 6 weeks 3 days.    If you are 6+5 then you conceived around Dec 24th-28th.
reO9Dgmsaa	Yes, and since you nursed so long already, your supply should bounce right back.  Good luck mommy!  :)|`|L6BOtQ6haa	You can, yes. Breast feed them until at least 1 year, its healthy for the baby|`|AA11011628	yes! that is called re-lactation'
reO9Dgmsaa	There is no way, since breast milk being re-introduced to the diet is only going to soothe any tummy problems.  Formula is harsh on the digestive system, not breast milk.|`|H1NjIT10aa	I highly doubt. it.  The re-establishment of milk doesn't change the components of the milk.  So it shouldn't cause upset stomachs.|`|0ac97caf2f92395a30dfa92e2b780b66aa	I was away from my baby for a few days ...around 4 days, when i got back he lactated as usual and he did not  have a problem
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	abortion is legal in all 50 states.....|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It is already legal, and it has helped a lot of women.  Believe it or not, there are indeed circumstances where abortion is the right option.  I do not like the idea of abortion, and I think that people who willingly have sex without any protection are the ones who should not be allowed to have one, but what about everyone else?|`|RzYePezkaa	Abortion is legal it is not illegal to terminate a pregnancy.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	It's already legal in the US.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Abortion has been legal since the supreme court case Roe vs. Wade.    The only thing that is illegal is partial-birth abortions, and those have been illegal for quite some time.  Also, the state's law would be overruled by the federal law about abortion.
h4Sc2JDwaa	the blood test will tell for sure, but you could get a faint positive peeing on a stick now! try it..what can it hurt?|`|xwMWfuBTaa	If your period comes after 20 days you probably dont even ovulate.    You uterine lining needs time to build up before ovulation before you can successfully get pregnant.  That means the earliest you can ovulate is day 10 for pregnancy, which means AF would begin day 24-25.  I would wait for another 3-4 days and get a beta hCG.
r07BwhO1aa	My daughter has lied to me 1 time and she is 8!!  This is how I curbed her of that nasty habit, feel free to amend what you must to fit your child:    1.  I spanked her  2.  I made her write these words and definitions over and over and over, Lie, Liar, Truth, Trust, Honesty, Dishonest  3.  For a month or so after she lied to me I questioned every thing she said, she did not like this, it made her feel real bad    The rule in my house is as follows if you did something bad but tell me about it then YES you will get punished for that but if you lie about it you will get punished for what you did plus a second worse punishment for the lie.    It worked for me, good luck with yours.|`|wBpennsMaa	I don't want my daughter ever having a memory of me hurting her, physically or emotionally. That is why I don't do the whole spanking/slapping thing. For each time she lied I would take away some allowance and she would be grounded for a specific amount of time.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Spanking does NOT teach your children.  I'm not saying it because I'm against it, I'm saying it from a psychological standpoint.  It doesn't teach them anything, in fact, the bad behaviour may still continue, and your child may be afraid of you for quite some time.    Time outs, taking away privileges, not allowing certain things, not giving treats, etc. are all perfect examples of ways to correctly punish a child.  By taking away an instinctive need (say a treat, or food), you're negatively reinforcing the behavior, therefore the behaviour will not be repeated.    eta: lol, seriously?  Think about it, all of you who have used spanking.  How many times was the behavior repeated?  How many times did you try spanking?  A small child's memory is not that good, and later, they are not going to remember WHY they're being spanked, all they're going to remember was "Mommy was mad and so she hit me! I didn't do anything wrong!"    Honestly, there's nothing more I have to say on this subject.  Psychology is going to overrule anything you think, no matter how many thumbs down you give me.|`|AA10529334	Yes I think that is a good punishment. You were under control- gave her a reasonable number of swats and made your point. The only way to control it is to never let her get away with it if you can help it - call her on it every time. Tell her the only way to get you off her back is to quit lying.|`|AA12181625	lie back.there is ice cream for desert.i made pie would you like some.psych! we are going to the amusement park so you can't go to your friend this weekend.AS for the spank i commend thee.NOW JUST DON'T MAKE A HABIT OUT OF IT.there are better ways.i know not on short notice.sh' plan ahead.no i didn't think i would have to either. but no matter how well you bring them up,they stray from the path intened.call it what you will ,i call it growing up.and they have to do that.but in good context.so we get over protective and they get a sore bottom.3 mos. my daughter was grounded when i caught her! @12yrs old with pot in her room.she then straightened her ways self grounded herself for life.now at 16.3 she asks for permission and lets me know everything.report cards are great.good luck(PS> the pot was so small an amount i felt bad.but amount it was.)|`|1h9DYByQaa	my daughter will be 7 in march and i have the exact same problem!!     like u described you saw her do something then questioned her about it and she lied about it..     she also has a look on her face that i know when she isnt telling the truth... i also get very frustrated on how to deal with it.. but i have come to a conclusion...its part of childhood..if you think back to when u were all kids i am sure you can recall sometime or other when you lied to your parents..i know i did and it took me a long time to learn that you get into less trouble owning up to whatever it is that been done that shouldnt have been than if you lie about it.     just have to try an encourage her that telling the truth is best and eventually she will learn.. spanking doesnt really get anywhere..  good luck x    mum of 4|`|BQYXgtq7aa	I dont think spanking is the answer, especially when the children is old enough to know right from wrong.  Sit your daughter down, alone with no interruptions and explain to her how it hurts you when she lies. Tell her it makes you sad and that you would rather she tell you the truth. That you and her (and her daddy) can work through it.   Perhaps if you catch her out lying, explain why it was that you feel hurt  (for instance, if she tells her teacher she didnt do her homework because grandma died or got very sick, and the teacher rings to say this, tell your daughter that its not a very nice thing to say, that Grandma is not sick and that she must apologise to her teacher for saying that and ask her teacher to give her extra homework. Prevent her from watching tv for 1 week or something.)    Another good option is to put her on a "naughty spot" for 1 minute for every year of life (so 7mins). Make sure you explain to her when you put her in the time out why she is there (for lying about.....) and tell her she needs to think about how this hurts the people around her and how it makes you not trust her. When the time is up, go back to her, get down to her level so youre not intimidating her and ask her to explain to you why she was put there and what she can do next time to avoid being there again. Give her a hug and ask her to apologise to the people she lied to and the ones she lied about.    When she admits that she lied (give her a chance to own up), tell her you appreciate her honesty and even tho she will still be punished (if its appropriate, like taking awway pocket money for that week but still doing the chores) tell her that you love her and that next time you would like to her be honest from the beginning.    She is testing the waters. Dont let her get away with it, if she feels she is in control. it can be very hard to get back the control.   If you need to put her on the naughty spot 3 or 4 or even a dozen times in a spate of a few hours, then so be it. Persevere and teach her that its better to be honest and accept the punishment than to lie and hurt the people she loves and who love her.    Good Luck|`|Kr09aQJkaa	If you see what she has done don't give her the opportunity to lie her way out of it. Just say I saw what you did and that's the end of it. Call her out on the lies. Don't let her finish the story if you know it's a lie.     An older child may benefit from a lesson in how lying hurts. Tell her your taking her for ice cream after school. When she gets home and asks if your going for ice cream tell her you lied. How's it feel?|`|qLkMSEBwaa	I have NEVER been informed by the school if my son got in trouble.  My son always came home and told me.  He knows I better not find out another way!  Further more..I spank, but don't have much need..my son by no means is perfect, but on his worst day, is better than most on their best.  He knows I'm serious!!! I would have spanked her for lying and for every time she lied on top of it..take away privileges 1 by 1...She would learn very fast!!!!!!!!  I'm mom dad everything in my home and with a teenage son taller than me, I made it clear early on who pays the bills and the door is open is he doesn't like the rules.  He not only chooses to stay but, tells me how much he appreciated how much I've done for him and the way I raised him.  He sees how the other kids in school acts, what they are doing, and where they end up..My son is grateful for the life and discipline I gave him..he is a young man I'm very proud of..good luck!!!!|`|zqfs7A6Caa	If she is lying to get out of trouble, her punishment should be double what it would have been for whatever she was lying about. If her father gives harder spankings, maybe you should have taken a privilege for what she did wrong, and then have her father handle the punishment for lying.    Four swats does not sound like much of a punishment for lying. She needs to be made truly sorry so she will think twice about ever lying as a means to avoid trouble again.     Think about all the times lying may have benefited her. You need to overcome that by making the punishment more severe than anything she is used to.|`|afFUs27kaa	i personally have nothing wrong with a hit, i was hit when i was younger if i did something wrong...but also gotta remember children will lie, jsut as adults will because it is a sense of self preservation. she knows she has done something wrong but is willing to take the risk of lieing to get out of it. but with a little punishment hopefully shell learn when lying is ok and when it isnt.|`|zyxvVUhzaa	Hey there, i dont have children, but my mum had the same problem with my sister. My sister once lied to her whole year group about winning eleven million dollars in lotto and told her teacher that she was livng in a hotel by herself. We then had the problem of her safety because of the way the world is nowadays.  My parents found that one of the best ways to solve this problem was to take things away from her. For example, she wasn't allowedto watch TV or she couldnt go over her friends houses.  I guess you gotta find out what causes her to lie and then try and help her to stop. You'll realise that most children will lie to fit in or to gain attention cause they might feel they dont get enough attention at home.  Hope all goes well  xXx|`|SRuMAjSpaa	The spanking should work, if you swatted hard enough.  Did she cry?  And if she did, was it a 'sincere' cry, or more of an irritated/pissed off cry?  If it was the latter, then I would suggest harder swats or more swats.  Or both.|`|tcU1Xnftaa	Kids memory is very short I doubt she will remember why she was spanked an hour later. She will just remember that you're mad at her. Next time I would probably not wait. Since you knew she was lying you probably should punish her by sending her to her room right away.     Some kids grow out of lying, and I hate to say some get worse.|`|KBKvUwAlaa	Sounds like you got her attention.  Personally I would have given her more than four but that is your call.  You need to be consistent though.  Let her know that she will get a spanking every time she lies, and make sure you follow through.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	I personally do not agree with spanking unless all other avenues have been used and do not work (communication, time out, grounding, taking away something she loves).    Hopefully for her sake she does get the picture that lying is not acceptable but if she doesn't and you haven't already tried it, try some of the above suggestions.    My parents always told me that if I tell the truth the first time I will not get into as much trouble as if I lie and am caught, that was enough to stop us from lying (It has also worked on all of our nephews).|`|vGxipYJnaa	Spanking isn't effective with some children, especially older ones, because they know it's temporary.     Tell her no dessert for a week, or don't let her watch TV for a week, take away a toy etc. That way, every time she wants dessert that week, or to watch TV, she'll remember what she did and hopefully never do it again.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I would first start with taking away privileges at this age... TV, video games, toys, friends coming over...and at last resort use the spanking.|`|XxSj6AsBaa	A taste of her own medicine might just do the trick.  Purposely fabricate something she would really be looking forward to such as a trip to disney land or the like.  Go through with the whole thing, packing luggage and all.  Go as far as loading the car to get to the airport, then let her know how it feels to be lied to.  She will never forget this example and will h ave a lot of explaining to do to friends as to why this happened.|`|711KONwOaa	yes,a spanking would probley be the best punishinment here
