20090128131155AAFvNHy	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Abnormal activity explanation please?	Let me start by saying i don't believe in ghosts or anything of that nature. However, this happened to me and everyone that i've ever asked about it to see what they thought cant come up with anything else.       Once, when I was about 20 I lived in a house with my mother and my bff. we all worked at the same place, they worked on weekends and i worked during the week. It was Saturday morning, i slept in till about 10. Mom and Angela were at work that morning.When i got up i went into the kitchen and all the cabinet doors and all the drawers were open as far as they would go. I didn't think anything of it at the time, i thought Angela had come home and played a joke on me or something. I called her at work and asked her if she did it, and she said no. Then I called my mother and asked her (even though she works 30 minutes away) she also said no. There are 3 doors to get in the house. The back door is rusted shut, the front door can only be locked from the inside and when locked cant be opened from the outside. the side door is the only one we can go in and out of. However one of the cabinets is right next to that door and was open so that it was touching the door, so if someone were to be playing a trick there's no way the door could be closed and the cabinet door still be open the way it was. All the windows in the house were painted shut as well.      Can anyone explain this to me WITHOUT saying it was ghosts?   At the time i didnt think anything about it.

20090128131213AAA6lmS	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Statistics question based on a given sample?	For each day during the entire month of December, a local hospital recorded both the high temperature and their number of emergency-room patients.      a) Identify the variables measured in this example    (I already figured that they are the temperature and the number of emergency room patients)      b) What is the sample size of this example?  I think that it is 31 because there are 31 days in december which would give them 31 pieces of data?      c) What are the "individuals" on which the variables you identified in part (a) are being measured?  I am not sure on this one.      If anyone could agree/disagree for a and b and then help me understand and figure out c it would be great thanks!

However, I'm wondering if one could live in a world without ANY background radiation at all ( with normal electromagnetic - light, UV, radio, etc), could that be unhealthy? Would cells expect some and malfunction if there is none. Could it make growth quicker?

20090128134034AAs00hg	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How does changing the denominator of a fraction work? How does the numerator change?	I looked this up online to get a better idea with this, but they didnt explain how they got any of this.      The problem was 6 2/6 + 2/8. They obviously dont have the same denominator, so you have to change it, they share 24, so 24 becomes the new denominator.   This is what I dont understand, is why the website said the numerators change?   This is what it said: 6 2/8 becomes 6 8/24. 2/8 becomes 6/24? How did that happen???      The answer came out to be 6 7/12 -after being simplified that is-      I just really need to learn how this works, so if someone doesnt mind answering what you do to the numerators, thatd be great. Also to show me that part on another question      8 2/3 + 7 4/6= 8 4/6 + 7 4/6?

Given parametric equation K, with:  x = 5sint + sin5t  y = 5cost + cos5t    Calculate the exact coordinates and the value of t for the turning points (I think that's what they're called?). In general a turning point is a point where both dx/dt and dy/dt are equal to zero.    I had this question on a test today and I couldn't figure it out. Can't remember the answer but I remember that the derivative of either x or y looked like 10sin3xcos2x.    You don't have to give a complete answer. It'll be enough to show me how to get to the derivatives needed as a multiplication instead of an addition.    Free cookies for those who help me ;)

Hey, I just ran some calculations to prove that space habitation is necessary and I got back scary numbers.       There are 6,706,993,152 (July 2008 est.) people in the world   Source    https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...    There are 148,940,000.00 sq km of land, same source.       That means       (Area of land/number of people) will give us land unit per person or .0222066724 sq km of land per person on earth, about 5 acres.       (Number of people/area of land) will give us person per land unit 45.03151035 people per sq km of land.       At least 1.2 acres of farmland is needed to support a person  http://dieoff.org/page40.htm       Of course this assumes that all land on earth is farmable, but the CIA fact book mentions that only 10.57% of the earth's land can be farmed. 10% of 5 acres is .5 acres of farm land per person. Falling below the min. amount of farmland. But, I think I made an error. Can you check. I'm doing this for the Dupont essay contest. Thank you so much.

I do have my grade 12 however I was thinking about going to college and actually making something of myself. Most courses require the participant to have a grade 12 math credit, so that's what I'm doing. I've been out of school for roughly 15 years so I'm a tad rusty...      What I would like to know is can someone explain to me in simple terms how to calculate linear equations. I'm not going to post the questions as I don't want them answered. I may post them when finished to see if I did them correctly...      I realize that I can call the Centre of Education and have them explain it to me however I was already on hold for 45 minutes and when I went to the office the wait time was well over an hour...      So if someone here could explain it to me (simplified) it will be appreciated.       Here is an example question with answer. Can someone explain to me how they come up with this...      Thanks      5(r+3) - r =(r-5) + 4r   5r +15 - r = -r +5 +4r   4r + 15 = 5 +3r   4r - 3r +15 = 5 + 3r - 3r   r + 15 = 5   r + 15 - 15 = 5 - 15   r = 10

20090406091905AAcpFU7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Help with a physics problem please!!?	Sorry it's kind of long...      It has recently become possible to "weigh" DNA molecules by measuring the influence of their mass on a nano-oscillator. Figure shows a thin rectangular cantilever etched out of silicon (density 2300 kg/m^3 ) with a small gold dot at the end. If pulled down and released, the end of the cantilever vibrates with simple harmonic motion, moving up and down like a diving board after a jump. When bathed with DNA molecules whose ends have been modified to bind with gold, one or more molecules may attach to the gold dot. The addition of their mass causes a very slight-but measurable-decrease in the oscillation frequency. A vibrating cantilever of mass M can be modeled as a block of mass 1/3 M attached to a spring. (The factor of 1/3 arises from the moment of inertia of a bar pivoted at one end.) Neither the mass nor the spring constant can be determined very accurately-perhaps to only two significant figures-but the oscillation frequency can be measured with very high precision simply by counting the oscillations. In one experiment, the cantilever was initially vibrating at exactly 11 MHz. Attachment of a DNA molecule caused the frequency to decrease by 46 Hz.      What was the mass of the DNA?

(Points: 3)           It will warm the earth's surface as more heat is trapped by the dust particles.              It will warm the earth's surface as more lava is released by the volcanic eruption.              It will cool the earth's surface as radiation from the sun is blocked from entering the atmosphere.

I can't see a practical purpose for these muscles on our species (besides that we still tend to find them aesthetically attractive). Millions of years ago our ancestors walked on all fours and these muscles were used a lot, when we look at animals that walk on all fours: cats, dogs, horses... These muscles are always very well toned on them.      As bipedal creatures it seems like the only way to get any exercise to these muscles is some contrived motion specifically to stimulate for the sake of stimulating them (well, there is swimming perhaps..)      PS. I don't care if I offended any creationists. The things I pointed out again suggest that Darwin was right. No offense, God.

I have booked in to se my Dr on tuesday but I know what he will say. I have had a whole bunch of symptoms since I was 16 (I am 22 now) when my grandmother died and I became down and began binge eating on sugary foods. I still do this and now dislike myself quite a lot as I am about 6.5 stone overweight and have a borderline unactive thyroid. I went to 2 health food shops and they put a scanner thing on my hand and used that and my symptoms to say I have a very severe candida overgrowth.. i think one of them said 60%. However, I began to get very anxious while obsesivly doing the strict candida diet and afrter 2 months felt like I had no results even though I had lost 3 stone. I went to see an eating disorder psychiatrist and another DR who said that candida is a load of rubbish and that i has typical stress symptoms. I am in a vicious circle because I feel to ill to be determined to lose weight and do well in university... so I eat and put more weight on.. and feel more ill... here are my symptoms that I have had every day since I was 16..

I was in physics just a few seconds ago and I'm a little confused over vectors       When you add vectors by head to tail you get a resultant vector. In my previous experience the resultant vector is just the addition of vectors. If x(arrow) = 4 and y(arrow) = 3 then the resultant vector when added head to tail is just 7. The professor said to use the Pythagoreom thm and the resultant vector would be 5.       But is that for head to tail or head to head or tail to tail???       Another thing when two vectors are added tail to tail you just add right but when two vectors are added head to head you subtract??
