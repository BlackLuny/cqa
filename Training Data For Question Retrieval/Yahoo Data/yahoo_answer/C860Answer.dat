Goodluck!|`|bo3CuPzeaa	I am sixteen, and I have been working since I was thirteen, all you have to do is go to a pub or restaurant and ask them if they have some washing up that needs doing, then after a couple of months you will be moving up the ladder and will be able to cook food etc.   Or a paper round, although they are not very well paid, they will look good on a CV because it shows commitment and dedication.|`|X3RRybHWaa	its limiting at 15 as most shops wont take you especially high street shops so dont bother with those as u are not old enough to work behind the tills. I would recomend trying most local hairdressers or maybe small shops like pet shops.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Paper round? Local odd jobs? Helping with a milk round or other delivery drivers?|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|XCtjuhujaa	soz bud, u gota b 16 and have a national insurance card.

If you can't find someone willing to take your case on a no win no fee basis, it's because you don't have much of a case.     Just because something bad happens, doesn't automatically mean you're entitled to money.  And, heck, "emotional damage", well, here in Texas, I tell my kids, "Cowboy up.".

Also what is wierd is that my brother rents my basement and he files a 1040ez and his was delayed until the 24th also,Could that be why because we both used the same address. cause i filed hoh...|`|z2Yk76RAaa	Mine is the same Monica. Went from 2/3 to 2/10 to 2/24! This is just crazy. I am so upset I can't even see straight. I am currently on hold with the IRS and this will be the 5th time I will talk to them. I want answers!     Update* I just got off the phone with the IRS and they told me my refund was pulled due to a small error that they were able to fix in house and didn't need to contact me for. She said that it is now out of the error department and is back on track to be deposited. She also stated that the 2/24 date was a tentative date and it could be earlier. So that is all I have been able to find out; however, I have checked and double checked my return and there were NOT any errors on it, so it is bogus crap any way you look at it.|`|el2blDi4aa	never heard of that
Daq9gituaa	Your employer may not be able to withhold taxes for state A (your state) unless they have work sites in your state also. Your state probably has provisions for making "quarterly" tax payments. For example, based on 2008, your tax liability was $201 and you expect your earnings and tax liability to be about the same for 2009. You would send in approximately $55.00 in MAR, JUN and SEP to your states tax department for credit to your 2009 liability. You would pay up the balance you owe when you file for 2009. You have the option of how much you wish to pay ahead of time and it keeps you from being hit with a big bill all at once. Contact your states tax department to see if they offer quarterly payments or what methods they have available to you. Note that your state probably has a provision for requiring at least 75-80% of your tax liability to be paid in prior to filing to prevent you being penalized.|`|IKakoOfyaa	Just as you said, make sure your payroll department is aware that you are still responsible for paying state taxes on your income since you reside in another state and have them adjust your deductions accordingly.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	move to the state were your working?  and if u live in the state then u have to obided be that states law not where u work  (:

AA11105522	Well, I just want to say thank you to the person that decided to post this information!!!! BIG PROPS TO YOU! because I just listed a similar question before I found this and now that I've found this and see that others are going through what I am going through and by sharing your experience gave me some ideas of how to dig a little more with my situation and I was able to find a more solid answer then before. Originally there was a date on the IRS site for mines to be DD on 2/10/09, before today I'd never heard of the IRS changing dates on there site but I checked it and the date has changed from 2/10 to 2/6. I don't know when it will actually happen but just to see an earlier date makes me a tad bit more comfortable. I really need a vehicle for my kids and I to get around and am praying that the funds come through sometime this weekend. THANKS AGAIN TO everyone for sharing there unique experiences!! Have a blessed year and wonderful day! Remember everyone try not to spend it all in the same place, consider investing in something that will last you long term... ;-)|`|z2Yk76RAaa	I talked to the IRS 5 times and finally got a supervisor. Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted processing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?|`|lgSF2TH7aa	my hubbys says code 1201 call  blah blah blah- and it had been saying feb 10th, so not every one is getting it tommorow, its only $100 so no sweat here.|`|el2blDi4aa	good. the IRS site told me february 10th too|`|8sCIIx5Gaa	nope i got the 24th on the 29th a day before i was suppose to get the refund. that is quite a wait. Some thing must be wrong with my return i was accepted on jan 18th. that is just to much time|`|fFcnk6h3aa	Mine was updated from the 10th to the 6th direct deposit this morning.  I am so anxious too!!!|`|7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	I filed early; the first day they accepted returns to be filed.  My date was changed from the 3rd to the 10th.  I had an offset for back taxes.  This morning, my refund was deposited into my account.  Finally!  So, I hold out hope for everyone who is still waiting on their refunds.|`|wC0sxhJXaa	mine was filed the 18th of Jan and was orignally given a date of the 3rd then it was pushed back till the 10th...today I got the msg on wmr site that it was being dd tommorow and the reason for the hold up was they were giving us an extra 600 dollars because during the year (after the stimulus we got married and had a baby) so they thought they owed us more...in actuality they don't but hey they screw us so??!! maybe thats what is happening to alot of other people thats what the irs has said!!|`|6SpPtA5Waa	Well I went from the 3rd to the 10th and this morning  it is not updated with a dd message,  nope I am the big winner of  a new date the 24th.|`|eBF45WO9aa	I checked the website this morning and mine too said a dd on the 6th, this time I hope that its right it seems that most of us on here knows what all of us are going through and that we really need the money more than we ever needed  it any other year before, its funny how when you really need something so bad it never comes through but right when you start to forget about it or you kind of lose hope it pops up.
0bF97fOTaa	I have had the same issues...employers seem to think once they have a good admin, they can hire the others they need from the outside.    Sometimes I think it is because we are so good at making our bosses look good, they want to keep up there in that slot.
lxo2XaAbaa	When you make a house payment your payment consists of Principle (the money you are paying back), interest, taxes, and insurance.  An Ecsrow account is where they put the money you paid for your taxes and insurance, so that when your taxes and insurance are due those bills can be paid.  So, when you originally close your loan they need to collect enough money so that in November, when the property taxes are due, the account has enough money to make the payment.  They are allowed to have about two extra months in that account but if taxes go up or your homeowner insurance goes up, the account runs dry and they send you a friendly little letter that says Your payment amount has been changed to some new amount.      Have you ever wondered who get the interest on your money in those accounts?  Collectively all those accounts sit with the lender and they benefit, from having all that free money sitting in those accounts.  Lenders love escrow accounts for that reason and they don't have to follow up and make sure you are paying your taxes.   While they are in first position with the loan, the government can take the house if the taxes are not paid.  If that happens the bank will lose their investment.  So they watch that really close.  Typically Excrow accounts are not required if you put at least 20 percent down on your home.   Some people pay their taxes directly to the government and pay their homeowners every year.  Hope that helps John.    Not to be confused with the other typical definition of escow, which means "the neutral third party that prepare the documents and discharges the intent of the contract, in an unbiased manner, when you buy or sell a home."  That is an escrow company.  You will hear people say "my home is in escrow."  That just means that there is an offer and that things are in a final stages of closing the deal. .|`|NZuJR79oaa	Escrow works by you paying more every month on top of principle and interest to pay the homeowners insurance and taxes.    There are many state laws regarding how large the balance in an escrow account can be.  Typically if your payment was increased, the cost of your insurance and/or the cost of your taxes increased.   See if you can provide your own insurance.  When I did this after paying the 20% down on my house to not have to escrow I saved $600 per year.  Now my insurance company is trying to increase my yearly premium by a large amount. By saying the replacement cost on my $45,000 home is now $230,000, up from $183,000 I year ago. You have to keep the insurers in check.     With taxes, you can contact your local assessor to re-assess your home. they will come out and assess it, it takes about an hour, and they will come up with its worth.  most years they increase your assessment, which increases your taxes.     Also vote against millage increases.
Daq9gituaa	Here is an excerpt from the IRS web site:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    The tax programs (Turbo Tax) asks you to enter the amount you received from the Stimulus Credit which was received in 2008. It is using the figure you enter to determine if you recived the full amount you were eligible for or not. In your case, you apparently received the correct amount. The info bar on the Turbo Tax pages only reflects a possible refund or payable tax amount and is not correct untill all entries have been entered and audited in the program.    If you care to see what happened on you own, I suggest you go the IRS web site, click on "1040 Central" and the click on the 1040EZ instruction booklet. When the PDF file displays, go to page 17 and read the worksheet used to determine if your rebate was for the full amount you were eligible for.|`|el2blDi4aa	no|`|AA11128266	It happen to me also thought it was tax free.

wPL4VrPSaa	serach google|`|M2AiWt85aa	I think I would contact small, locally owned businesses who are willing to look "forward" into their marketing campaigns.      Like, the small daycare down the street.  Position yourself as an "independent marketer" and offer them your services for a fee.  Tell them you can create "X" for them, and put it on their website.    You can even take this a step further, and make a website of commercials for your city.  If you do this though, you should probably require that the business offer some sort of discount in the production.  (This will bring more citizens to your site.)  You might even want to allow users to "rate" the business.    Good luck, and you CAN create a niche for this idea!  Sell the idea to businesses as a way for them to stand out in this economy - and offer them a deal they can't refuse!

This would not be true of all complexes, if you do not want to do what is required you should look elsewhere for housing.|`|n0k2ArPwaa	What you describe sure sounds strange, but it raises some questions about where you live.    First off, who is requiring apartment owners to do this service work?  Is this a state law? a local town, or county law?    Has this been published in any newspaper?  Ask your landlord for a copy of the law or regulation that requires this.   Maybe somebody is just trying to put something over on you.    Next, are you receiving some kind of a subsidy, like free or reduced rent?  If that is the case, it could be a means to get you to "pay" for what you are receiving.

I imagine you should get yours next Friday, the 13th....OMG FRIDAY THE 13th!! Scary movie night!! LMAO.    ETA: First poster is correct.

In a nutshell, there are two types of group interviews: you face a group, or you are part of a group of candidates. It's probably the latter. The key to this type of interview isn't that you have all the answers, but how you interact with the group. Doing things like asking the quiet guy "what do you think?" are considered plusses.

wbJXqkVGaa	Howdy:) I agree with you.   They do some good work in the area of health (WHO), Peacekeeping, UNHCR, ...but when it comes to political issues such as the ones you mentioned, they are helpless. Remember how George Bush shoved it aside to invade Iraq and how Israel is in constant violation of UN resolutions yet nothing is done about that.   We are living in anarchy (no world government) and that is why the strong can do what they want and the weak suffer what they must.;-)    Very good Q!;-)|`|tDvyf3Q5aa	it's like a church advising governments to be good blah blah blah, but who cares. you can ignore the church unless when you need it to do something for you like funerals etc. that's what they are respected for. like a church, they also believe to be the most important union ever.|`|kgNkuNOJaa	Agree with Mary :-*|`|xE8orz6Daa	Doesn't really matter though.

However, whatever you may think of 9/11, 7/7 and the conspiracy theories that go with them. Israel is the suspected perpetrator in both according to many theories. Kind of obvious when jews were killed or injured during 9/11. The American and UK government along with the UN did nothing while Israel mass murdered innocent civillians. You have to ask the question...Why not? But lets be honest, most folk already know the answer!|`|w8KBasGYaa	A legal tool for the world powers to legalize their illegal actions.|`|VkXv4RInaa	its pretty much a joke.

The UN do quite a lot around the world, in terms of education, humanitarian relief and peacekeeping.  You are ENTIRELY right about their performance vis a vis Israel.  There are literally dozens of outstanding resolutions which Israel remains in violation of, and which the UN is factually powerless to do anything about because the US always blocks any proposed actions against that state.  Sanctions? They've worked elsewhere, but the US won't allow them against Israel.  Direct involvement, for example UN supervision of the border crossings? That has also worked elsewhere, but the US won't allow it for Gaza.  There is a lot of unity within the UN, and many agreed actions resulting in worthwhile outcomes, but the US has a veto, and the UN is powerless when that veto is exercised
LV28z713aa	I'm in the process of purchasing my first home, and my realtors have been a great help.  First and foremost, a realtor that is familliar with the area you are interested in, will know the community well and be able to tell you about its history and about the other houses in it.  A realtor will be able to take your wishlist and find properties that match your requirements. When you find your house, a realtor will help you write an offer, find what other similar houses in the area are selling for, and help you negotiate a fair price.  When you have an accepted offer, a realtor will help you coordinate with a lender, a home inspector, an insurance company, a title company/escrow officer and/or real estate lawyer and the sellers to make sure your house "closes" on time without any major hassles.  When you put an offer on a house, you must give a deposit along with it.  That deposit is placed in an escrow account (an un-biased middle man who will hold your money for you, or give it to the sellers if you break your contract). When all the home-buying work is done, there is a meeting with all interested parties where the escrow officer will distribute the money to the right people (bank to you, you to sellers, sellers to taxes, etc).  When all this is done, your escrow account is closed, which is why that final step is called the "closing".  Buying a home is really hard work and I am very grateful to have awesome real estate agents who were familiar with the area and the whole process to help us out when things got a little rough!|`|CvtDsOB4aa	I Agree With Mia  I Watch All Those Shows Also !

n0k2ArPwaa	Since you have a good relationship with your boss why not bring up the subject in a conversation.    You could tell him (her) that you're about to finish your studies soon and that you've been starting to think about what you're going to do after-wards.  (Put this way, you're creating a bit of doubt that you're going to want to stay on without threatening to quit.  This might give your boss the chance to tell you that they like your work and want you to stay on.)    As your conversation progresses you might mention that you like working for the company and that you're wondering what opportunities and future there is for you there.    You might mention your increased responsibilities and knowledge together with your upcoming degree and, perhaps suggest how these might benefit the company    One key point:  If you can suggest additional things that you can do for the company ... especially problems you can solve or expenses which you can reduce you will be showing that you are helping rather than creating problems.  On the other hand, if you simply ask for a raise because other people are getting more, or because the cost of living has gone up, you are, in a way, just creating a new problem for your boss to solve.    These ideas may help|`|e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	In your posting, you make a good case for why you deserve a raise. But consider that for most employees at most companies, the best they can hope for is compensation review and possible raise once a year.

YTqUDSpEaa	I got this for that error code. "1201 All other conditions not covered by a status code conduct account analysis"  so whatever that means...    I received a error code this morning. My original deposit date was supposed to be the 30th, then the 3rd and then the 10th. It was accepted on the 18th.. so I have been waiting wondering what is going on. Now this morning it says there was a error, my refund amount has been adjusted and it will be deposited tomorrow morning. The error had to do with my rebate from last year (stimulus payment)  I thought we got back $1,200. We got back more than $1,200. So all this time they held it up for that, BUT what gets me is I did my brother's taxes on turbo tax as well and I put in $300 for his rebate amount, IRS rejected it. So I called him and he said no, it was $600. I put $600 in and it was accepted. My problem is this..why the hell didn't they simply reject mine 3 weeks ago like they did his so I would know and fix it instead of sitting her waiting for three weeks.   I see a lot of people with a lot of complaints against the irs this year.|`|7LTtqr1Caa	I got the same exact message on my refund page as well- i called this morning and stayed on hold for almost an hour only to be told " we have been having allot of problems with the system and my refund is still be processed and if I don't have it by next friday- 02/13/2009 to call back at that time."

YFaOg5izaa	According to what you have put here, I believe that you will be ok, as you have opened up and have been honest despite your misfortunes.  If you were my employee and you had told me that, after several supervising meetings, if I felt that you were hiding something, I would go back to your Cv and contact the employers, or get the HR to do this. But this is what the security check is for. Everything should be fine.     You could inform your employer that you missed out some information. Write it down on a piece of paper and hand it to him/her.  Tell them that it just slipped your mind, as it was something you completely forgot about.

A financial bubble itself is nothing special. It occurs every so often. There are no policies that can prevent it. It happens with any market. The less regulations the more severe the consequences.   The main reason for THIS bubble in particular, the subprime mortgage bubble , were very low interest rates by the FED. In order to get the Economy going again after the dot-com bubble and 9/11 interest rates were lowered immensly. This made cheap money available encouraging many to buy a house, perhaps also because they believed that a house was, compared to stocks, a safe investment.   Due to a lack of regulations something called securitization came into existence - Banks could now sell on mortgages in large bundles. Now imagine you're a bank; You can issue a mortage - and sell it (with all risks) on. Where'S the point in checking wether the debtor can afford it? Just sell it to him!  So loads of mortgages were issued to people who couldn't afford it. Often the debtors weren'T even thoroughly informed about the mortgage they obtained in order to sell more mortgages. These mortgages payments rates of many so called ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgages) were set to increase - without the debtor knowing.  Now hre'S what happend.   People couldn'T afford the mortages anymore. Those who had bought the mortgage bundles form the banks realised that, the bundles they had bought for millions of dollars were worth nothing. They had to write them off. Needed new money - pulled it from the sotck market. so eveyone lost there.  Banks couldnT sell on the mortages anymore and themselves had bought bundles. So they lost there.   As a consequence they stopped lending money - so many people had to stop buying. More losses on the SE and so on - a chain reaction.|`|nhC39Lchaa	inability for one to do feasibility studies before investing in any business

Prices on homes have gotten so incredibly inflated over the past decade, that they had to come down.  You are just paying for four walls. The only reason we justify $300,000 homes is because of 30 year mortgages making the payment doable, and on the false expectation that home values will increase by 7 - 20% per year every year, while the mortgage interest rate is 6%.  Faulty logic.|`|1Ejsw7Yaaa	Sorry, but its a complete guessing game. Anything could happen. I guess it will continue to fall...a good bit more.|`|fCF02V87aa	My friend---if we knew the answer to that question we could become millionaires. I don't know how bad things are in England but they are awful here in the USA. As long as foreclosures continue---unemployment at record rates--and banks not lending I see the market continuing to drop. Sooner or later its got to level out--Property will never be worthless. Foreclosures have a big effect on everything---when they sell cheap---the values of the surrounding properties also declines.
Hx88UGlpaa	Greg...Chris C's post was a help....adding to that...first things first....the credit card debt...if it is not in your name, you need to find out if she put you on as an authorized user, if so, you are not responsible, if you signed on the dotted line to get the credit cards, yes you are responsible. If you did not sign, you need to contact each credit bureau and have them remove the incorrect information as in fact they are hurting your credit. As posted and as I mainly advise, bankruptcy should be your absolute LAST resort. If you make over the median income to qualify for a chapter 7, the only alternative is a chapter 13, which takes an allotted amount of money determined by the courts to pay for the debts. They would most likely have you sell the other home to pay for some debts, the chapter 13 plan runs either 3 or 5 years, depending on income. The payments are sent to the US Trustee of the bankruptcy court who then distributes the monies to the secured debts first, un secured last. While in a plan like this, anything financed you have to have the trustee approve. I'm not a fan of the chapter 13 as it leaves you with very little money to survive on. Debt consolidation, well...scam if you ask me..I'm not a fan of that either. As far as the vehicles, sell the beater and get the money to pay the debt if you are responsible for them. The trustees of the courts could make you sell the mobile home and pay off debts with the money. Best advise, you could contact a bankruptcy attorney to find out what your options are, most will see you free the first consult. You can check in www.cccs.org..which is a consumer credit counseling that I have heard is excellent. What you need to keep in mind...A bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years, the debts for 7...If the debts are not paid, they can garnish wages and or bank accounts up to 100%...sounds like you have done well, and know how to pay your bills and are just overwhelmed with knowing she has left you with this debt. Here is another website that I found excellent information for credit, debts and bankruptcy issues...  www.bcsalliance.com   a good friend led me to that link and it provides excellent information. Good Luck!!|`|3QsPl1uLaa	I do not see a problem. You have a judgment that shows the 15K in debt is all hers.Explain that to the credit card companies. So she has messed up your credit.

I would suggest you to go with debt consolidation website. If you wipe out all debt you can live debt free life.|`|8xDOEr63aa	Do neither. You are not bankrupt and debt consolidation is a con.    Did you sign up for those cards yourself? Are they in your name but you did not apply for those credit cards? You are not responsible for debts you did not sign for. Period.    If your ex-wife took out those lines of credit in your name without your consent she has committed fraud. If that has happened, here, you are not responsible for a penny of those debts!    You may need to file a police report on your ex wife if that is the case.    Sell the stupid cars, dude.

It also says to wait until Feb 11 to call the IRS if it hasn't shown up in my bank account. My bank is pretty fast with clearing electronic deposits, so I'm expecting the money tomorrow. This will make my wife VERY happy!|`|cqicMDDnaa	It depends on whether you are getting an exact DD date(Your refund is scheduled to be deposited on..) , or does the website tell you that you're return is being processed and to expect it by a certain date?     A lot of people are getting that message and their dates keep changing. Mine did that. It was first set by Feb 10, then by Feb 17, and now the site is telling me that it is actually scheduled for Feb 10. I will let everyone know if I get it tomorrow.     I can tell you this though. My son was given a date of 2/4. That is a Wednesday, and it did indeed come in on Wednesday. My bank does not hold our DD's so we get them right away as soon as the place sends them. When I asked about it being a Wednesday(cause like others, we were hoping for last Friday), I was told that the IRS can send them on any day they wish and not just on Fridays. They do send in batch, but the batches can be sent anytime, day or night.

8xMhLMoRaa	What are the typical questions you are thinking of? In general, your interviewer will want to know about your previous experience, how you work alone and how you work as part of a team, and how commited you will be to a company. Figure out some example situations that you can tell them about. The situations don't need to have actually happened, just pretend they did, and tell the interviewer how you dealt with them. Make sure you tell them about good and bad things that happened, they want to know how friendly you are as well as how you cope in a crisis.

This is a boost to the demand side, rather than supply side, of the economy.
RNqRnG86aa	In the Fair Trade system, social and economic development is made possible through an additional payment producer cooperatives receive called the Fair Trade Social Premium. This social premium is an additional sum of money above the Fair Trade minimum price, which is paid directly to producer groups by importers of Fair Trade Certified products for investment in economic and social development in their communities.    The Fair Trade minimum price is used by the producer to cover the cost of sustainable production, while the Fair Trade Social Premium is used by the producer cooperative to improve their livelihood with investments in the community in areas such as healthcare, infrastructure and education.
RliEKzuAaa	A+ will get you a helpdesk job. Don't kid yourself into thinking it's worth more, because it's not. CCNA is only good if you go all the way but there are plenty of unemployed Cisco techs. Right now the only chance at a decent IT career is pick up some Linux and .net programming / database administration.     IT is a volatile field. Don't kid yourself into thinking it's stable and readily available. Most of my friends and I are in the IT field at various areas and all of us have been hit with outsourcing and lay offs. Most of those jobs posted on monster etc right now will close in the following weeks because the position has been eliminated. Otherwise you will be in competition with the hundreds that are being outsourced left and right.     Network administration is being quickly shipped overseas right along with the helpdesk; programming in general is long gone. Yes, there are exceptions. Some companies are still domestic, but don't count on it and don't forget there's many others with the same or better qualifications who are unemployed. The ones who do get jobs are expected to turn out 3 times a normal human being should do (and I'm not kidding. I've had teams that are already hundreds of work orders behind be subjected to lay offs; the work doesn't stop coming when the team gets increasingly smaller.)    So you can try your hand at .net which is there, but you have to be ready to kill yourself over it as well. Or you can try to weasle your way into field services, which generally requires you to do your time on the helpdesk.    I trained CCNA techs as monkey labor because they couldn't get a job.    I'm not being harsh or bitter (ok maybe a little bitter), but I'm very much in the field right now, so is my husband, and so are most of our friends. We have a great spread of what's really going on in this world. It's not pretty and I don't honestly advise it. If you're determined to work long weeks squinting at a computer screen to be laid off on a Friday with no forewarning, then go for it.    I use to work in bar/restaurant. Went to IT. Going to RN now. I'm washing my hands of this cr*p.    Best of luck.|`|J9pIrpkBaa	I am doing my A+ exam next week.

IKakoOfyaa	Mine changed from the 10th to the 17th a few days ago and was also accepted on the 29th.  The status has not changed as of this morning.  It still shows the 17th and crossing my fingers it stays that way.  Many people are saying that every week, their refund dates are getting pushed back a week.|`|mtPZcGs6aa	when was your return accepted? Mine also changed from the 13th to the 17th,but I just checked,it still says the 17th :(...........my return was accepted on the 29th.|`|qfLGpEpXaa	Yesterday mine stated it was processing and would be dd on the 10th.This morning i checked and while yes i did incorrectly put in the amount of RRC they have corrected it (with an explanation) and are dd it on the 6th. Mine was filed on the 16th accepted on the 19th which because of the RRC mistake only caused it to be pushed back 1 week. I,like most of you have been sitting on pins and needles  waiting for this refund so hang in there it will either be here friday or soon thereafter.|`|ITHPxTdvaa	mine was changed from  feb 10 to we found a mistake with your return and we fixed it the found a mistake in my favor an is seculed to be dd on feb 6 but the monney is already in my bank
FwTKWcC4aa	FYI for anyone else out there reading this, if you want to stop advertisements coming to your email, there is usually an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.  If you click this, then it should take you to a page where you can delete your email from their list.     It takes a few days for the company to update their database, and it's a slow process, but it's a start!   (I'm only posting this because my husband had no idea about the unsubscribe and he was getting so mad that he kept getting junk email- so hopefully this helps someone!)

M2AiWt85aa	I could literally write a book about your question.  Part motivation, part work from home ideas!  I will try to keep this from becoming the next best seller!  :)    I saw the response from somebody about this not being the right time to start a new business.  Well, I agree because this is a very hard time to start something IF you do it the wrong way!  This is a wonderful time to start something IF you do it smart, and you do it smart!  (Yes, I know I put it twice!)    The fact that you have many years of sales experience is a major perk.  That does not mean that you need a job in "sales", but with any business, you really have two main jobs:  1.  To sell your service or product.  2.  To get new customers (where your advertising and marketing comes into play!)    Ask yourself these questions:  1.  What do you love to do?  2.  What can you help other people do?  3.  What are your hobbies?  4.  What are you doing when you start something at noon, and don't realize 5 hours have gone by when you finally look at the clock?  (This is a great indicator of something you love.)  5.  What is missing in YOUR daily life?  This means, what do you *wish* somebody would create (product or service) that would help you out?    This list could go on and on - but I think you get the main idea behind it.    Many people say to "do what you love".  I have always understood this, but never really understood why until recently.  I have tried many, MANY ideas of mine to make money from home.  I thought I really enjoyed doing them, but until recently, I didn't realize that I wasn't loving them enough to put the time needed into them.    I have finally found something (an idea of mine) that will help other people - A LOT - while helping myself.  However, because I am SO loving this idea, I am finding that the time I put into it is extreme.  However, time flies by so fast, and I absolutley love what I am doing.  If I just would have LOVED the other ideas this much, I might be a millionaire by now! :)    I understand you not being able to work for other people.  Trust me - I really get that.  You go about working for yourself by creating the "job" you want - and do it as cheap and effectively as you possibly can.    IF you still have your "employment" job - keep it!  For now, anyway.  You will need some money to start a website, order marketing materials, and other stuff that will come up.    Set goals, and make sure you achieve those goals.  Go to the business section of your local bookstore and browse the selection.  You will find MANY great books on working from home there.    Remember though - remain true to yourself and be creative!  You will find more success if you stay away from those "business in a box" ideas.    Congratulations!|`|AA11591747	I think, you have to register first.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	You need to look for a product that is in demand and start to market it.  There are trade shows for this type of venture.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	All this is only my opinion obviously.  I don't really think this is the economic climate to make that a good decision.  Many businesses that have been long established are failing now, which doesn't necessarily make it a good time to start a new business.  People are not buying as many things that they don't need, and trying to spend less on things they do need (you will probably be unable to offer them better deals, with the low volume you would be going through.    Making $50-60k is something that the average american will never do in their lifetime.  They may not even manage it counting a spouse working, as well.    Most small businesses can take a year or more to get established and start breaking even, IF they ever do.  Do you have the kind of investment money to not only put down for initial supplies, but also to keep yourself afloat for several years if this doesn't pay out?    It looks like you are looking for an easy way out, of which there is none.  People who make money with their own businesses need to have incredible drive and ambition, you need to really WANT to own a business, not just want to not have a boss, but still make lots of money.    The unfortunate truth is that very few people would continue working if they had no use for the income.  People need to work for money if they want to continue to buy provisions.  After 20 years, I would think that it has become glaringly obvious that you CAN work for other people, if you've done it that long, I don't know what the problem is now.    Anyways, I do wish you the best of luck with your idea, but I think that if you attempt to put it into practice with just the help of some people on yahoo answers, you are likely to be another statistic bankruptcy in the economic downturn we are currently having.|`|SBikhIzBaa	hehe,to be a self-employed  sometimes is not so hard if you find a rightway, as my  experience,to run a online shop is the most reasonable method than that ads union or click earning.In my country china, millions of young people who wanna to work at home, they just opened their own online store at www.taobao.com. U know it is a good way for you to import some hotsale items from china than sell them.It will be a good price advantage if you directly wholesale things from china.     I am a local chinese buy agent, i can do purchase for foreigners with chinese items to help their small business or daily life use,things could be from taobao.com and other china online shopping sites or china wholesale market or directly from factories.www.taobao.com is the biggest C2C online shopping site in aisa,it is just like another ebay,you can find cheap brand cloths,shoes,bags there,some are the order rest from china OEM factory,and some are 1:1 highly alike replica.

KaAXJJo8aa	Take the job for now because you might not find another job in this economy.|`|AHCelSY1aa	Nothing.

You can refuse but also risk being terminated.|`|SLy9xFwkaa	well it depends, is the change perminant? if so if you want to be an engineer then you need to go elsewhere to work.|`|8d71245589a5c5738df7b583c1ece4c0aa	Screw HIM!!!|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Tell them it isn't in your job description.

If a manager or supervisor asks you to do other duties you should do it and not second guess it.  I could understand if it against the law or endangers you in any way but its not going to its a secretary position.
OOkNg0IIaa	Yes, in general, paid surveys are real, but the problem is that there are far more sites "posing" as surveys out there than there are real ones. I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago. I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5. The next few months were more of the same. But I stuck with it and was patient. Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1. There are no guarantees with surveys. It's all about your demographics. Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find. The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list. Period. All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient. If it works for you, it won't work instantly. I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month." Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk. You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great. And if you don't you walk away. If you want to check out my blog where I track the survey sites that have actually paid me, feel free to visit http://www.thesurveystar.blogspot.com    Good luck!|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	I tried a few similar to it and was never paid.  It seems there are too many links etc for the surveys and then you have to wait for you payment  and it never comes.|`|3EqmcGYyaa	I tried it before and it just kept giving me links and links to go to....got way to confusing and not worth my time.

NZuJR79oaa	It depends. Some cities and states have laws concerning employers with over X amount of employees have to give any where from 1 week to 2 months notice.  Some union contracts include similar language.      In general though, they don't have to tell you until they do it.  In practice, most companies will inform employees once they are aware that they are closing down.  Also, you can generally see it coming.  There will be layoffs, cost cutting measures that go to extremes and a general feeling of doom around the workplace.      Always have an updated, professional Resume on hand and a plan as to where you are going to go to find a job in the event of loosing yours.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	In the state of Texas there is nothing requiring a business to give advance notice.

RliEKzuAaa	Deserve the promotion: point out extra things you've done, NOT job requirements. For example, don't say, "I've been on time almost every day." No, that's what you do to keep your job, not earn promotions. But you could say something like, "As time permits, I've been learning about the back end processes of xyz and volunteered to write documentation on it for new hires." Of course, make sure 1. you really have learned something/volunteered something and 2. it's pertinent to the promotion. Be creative. The point is to sell yourself without being conceited, and to differentiate between what's required as your job vs what you've done to be an asset.    Weaknesses are trick questions. You should find something that is of course truthful, but can also be construed as a positive, too. Also, show how you've attempted to correct it. Don't highlight something that would be detrimental to your job or promotion. But never, ever, say you don't have any or that you can't think of any. Wrong answer.    btw - do not answer a question with a question. That's terrible interview etiquette. It does not show you are a thinking person but is construed as trying to challenge them. I've had many friends fail job interviews for that reason.|`|jIccV2sOaa	Always answer questions with another question. It shows you are a "thinking person".|`|n0k2ArPwaa	1)  If you can't answer that maybe you should forget about wanting the promotion.  Seriously:  You need to believe in yourself and that's what the question is seeking to determine.      The answer must be in your own words but should convey the idea "Because I think I'm the best person for that job"    2)  Show some humility by stating "Well, I know I'm not perfect, but I don't think I have any important weaknesses that are important to this position."    Then go on to say, "However, some people have told me that I sometimes am a bit too....  Then tell them something that is actually a quality which would be considered an asset, like perhaps "persistent"  or "honest".   Expect, of course, that they're going to ask you why, so have an answer and an example prepared.

IKakoOfyaa	There is no rhyme or reason to the refund delays this year.    We e-filed, no dependents, took the standard deduction, no rebate recovery credit (which I understand, was incorrectly claimed by many people). Our return was accepted on the 29th and the WMR site showed an expected date of refund on 2/10.  This suddenly changed to the 17th.  I called the IRS and was told there was an error on my return, but they couldn't tell me what it was, although my refund amount hadn't changed.  I subsequently found out the error was on their side.  Their computers are arbitrarily kicking out correctly filed returns because of that &$^%@   recovery rebate.    If you call the IRS, wait until tonight (after 8PM).  You're more likely to get a CSR who will actually give you a straight answer and speak to you like you're a human being.  Good luck to you.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	mine too!!!!

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	This is very common.  It seems to especially come up with employers who have self-funded health insurance plans.  (Self-funded = the money to pay medical claims comes from the employer.  So, the employer is assuming the risk for medical expenses.)    You're lucky that your husband's employer gives you the option to pay a penalty and still be covered, if you don't take your employer's insurance.      With my employer, if my husband didn't take the insurance through his work, then he couldn't be covered on my plan AT ALL.  At least you have a choice between paying the penalty or taking your own insurance as primary.    Though honestly...it makes sense, if you think about it.  Especially for self-funded employers.  Why should your spouse's employer be on the hook for your medical expenses, if you can get primary coverage through your own workplace?  Employers have to make tough decisions these days.  Makes more sense to require spouses to go on their own employer's coverage, when available, rather than stop offering health insurance entirely.    Its not a "scam" - its making YOUR employer be primarily responsible for YOUR medical expenses.  That's not an unreasonable thing to ask, if you think about it.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	That may be illegal -  check with  your state's insurance regulators...|`|y2ZukikXaa	They can only force you to stay on the plan for the full year, but they can't force you to PAY for something.  At open enrollment you could just drop it.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Unless you are morbidly obese, smoke or have pre-existing conditions, you are way overpaying for health insurance.  Try getting a high deductible health care plan with an HSA if you are in relatively decent health.      To change your lifestyle so only one person has to work, you must cut expenses and (maybe) increase income.  Your main two expenses are most likely income taxes and housing. If only one person is working you drop your tax bracket because the top dollars are taxed more heavily due to a graduated income tax. Downsize your house to a smaller house in a cheaper area.|`|URO3gDXcaa	they can't force you to take out insurance with your company if you are already covered.  there is something wrong here.  call the state insurance department.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yep, this is NORMAL.  MOST group insurance companies charge extra, if the spouse has coverage available through their employer, but doesn't take it.      Why should HIS employer pay the cost for YOU?  It's not fair to the employers who offer BETTER plans, unless they do this.      Fair, though, isn't even "fair", because the vast majority of the cost, is STILL on the employer's wallet.  "Fair" will be if/when everyone pays for their OWN insurance.

0Umym3h9aa	Well that isn't really a reason to quit work. You could have simply fixed your breath problem. You seem to have a serious problem with bad breath, I suggest going to your local clinic or family doctor because it could be something in your stomach.|`|9iXGakohaa	It sounds like it could be a sinus infection or rotting of the gums. This is something your dentist can advise you on. They will be able to figure out the problem and also give ways to fix the problem. So schedule an appointment asap! Until then keep up the brushing (especially brush your gums), floss after you eat, and use mouthwash.     If you schedule your appointment soon enough you will be on your way to fixing your bad breath problem and back to work!|`|oDnEGXO1aa	Maybe you have a sickness in your stomach.. Try visiting your dentist and ask for advice|`|kgUzdfqVaa	Go to the doctor - there is obviously something wrong.You may even have some sort of infection.

These include the following:       Qualified Tuition Programs (529 plans)Earnings grow tax-deferred and distributions are tax-free when used for qualified post-secondary education costs.      Coverdell Education Savings Accounts Earnings grow tax-deferred and distributions are tax-free when used for qualified post-secondary education costs. May also be withdrawn tax-free for primary and secondary school expenses.      However, don't invest more in these than the child will need for college.  There are tax penalties for non-educational withdrawals.  Additional funds should be invested in a UGMA or UTMA.

BoAEgaAGaa	The IRS is verifying stimulus amounts before releasing the extra refund.  So if they verify that you actually were to receive this amount they will send it separately.  The IRS will be sending you a letter to explain any difference if they do not release the amount you thought you were to receive.      Keep in mind if you received the full amount in the check you received in 2008, you will not receive any extra this year.  Or if you did not receive a check last year and you qualify with your 2008 tax return you will receive the correct amount.

UjFKq4wpaa	I blame the media for much of what is happening today regarding the bids on homes and I am sorry to learn you are one of the home owners having to endure this.    Nobody knows for certain how the housing market will look like in 6 months.  However, there will always be a buyer for the right price, so be sure that your home is priced fairly.  The rule of thumb is if larger than 1,500 sq.ft., the price per sq.ft. is smaller.    My advise is to stage your home, make it look like a hotel (get the picture?).  Remove all clutter, call PODS or Pack Rats or similar and store all items that you can do without for a few months.  Keep in mind that most people like to just move in and enjoy the house rather than having to paint, change carpet or fixtures.  Listen to the comments and do your best to change those items that are the "buts" where you can.  Listen to your agent as well.  She should have a realistic $ figure to sell your house.    To avoid mud on your floors, go to Home Depot and buy disposable shoe covers.  Place them in a basket at the entrance with a sign "please cover your shoes if muddy".  And a second basket for used shoe covers.    Home prices under market value is the rule right now but the best houses, those that are staged, DO sell first.  Good luck.    ----  If the complaints are that the kitchen is smaller, it is because you have an additional bedroom, thus fit for a larger family.  I would not enlarge the kitchen.  You are likely to have had the kitchen totally unclottered (minimal stuff on counters) and draweres neat inside and with minimal stuff.  Staging the extra bedroom as an office or media/game room might help.    Are other houses selling in your neighborhood?  Any houses pending?|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I don't see it going up anytime soon.

It may take more than six months for things to rebound, but it can't get much worse.

Then if someone offers you less you can ask him why he's such a moron and when is he going to learn to read? Payback!    Good luck.|`|fCF02V87aa	It is the Buyers Ballgame right now----because of the state of things and the amount of foreclosures----the value of everything is down.

(what people don't know sometimes doesn't hurt them).  no one really knows.  i hear 2nd half of 2009 things will start to recover.  i've heard not until 2010.  some areas have actually seen home sales rise, which will eventually lead to prices coming back up.      have you thought about keeping the house and renting it out while you live the other one?|`|Qqz0H2hEaa	My definition of market value and yours are two different things.  If you have your home priced cheaper than other homes like your are SELLING for right now in your area then your story is very strange.  I would think you are being mislead on what the homes are selling for or on their condition, or something is faulty about your house.    If instead you are comparing your home price to what other people have priced their homes- I don't consider that market value.    If you have your home priced truly below market value then buyers would be fighting to buy your home.  Look at the market.  There may not be as many houses selling right now- but there are houses selling- and those are the ones you need to compare to get the true market value.

Many of the people who used to either go to the pizzeria or call for home delivery of a pizza are now getting their pizza at the supermarket and cooking it themselves in order to save money.

Normally when you clain EIC and child tax credits it bumps up your chance to get reviewed. I'm sure it will be fine as long as you didn't lie about anything on the return. Also, I've heard that the IRS is about 1-2 weeks behind in sending out refunds so expect delays.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	It could mean quite a number of things.    Usually, the computer processes the returns, it is more or less automatic. Anything that requires a "human" takes much longer.    So, occasionally the IRS does "random" audits (like every 1000th return). Or, the IRS has priorities that shift each year, sometimes a review of EIC is a priority.    Or, possibly, someone else claimed your kid after you filed. Or, if you claimed head of household, someone else also claimed head of household who apparently lives at the same address. Or, you owe back taxes, delinquent student loans, federally backed mortgage, or back child support, and they are getting a payoff amount.     Since the IRS has strict privacy policies, there is no way to know for sure, except to wait.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	apparently people with large refunds,dependents, and those that got the recovery rebate are getting "manually" checked..thus holding up the refunds.

The IRS does this with a certain number of returns every year.  Basically, it's a "mini-audit", for lack of a better term, to make sure your return is correct.  It will be compared to prior years, the info on your W-2s validated, etc.  There may be absolutely nothing wrong with your return or nothing on it to red flag, just the fact that you had the misfortune of having your return selected for this process.  If you do not owe any debts that can have refund monies used for payment or owe other taxes, your refund will be issued, it just takes more time.    The recovery rebate issue happened to many people, even those who didn't claim it, due to a problem with the IRS computers.  It is my understanding that if this is the case, refunds are being delayed by a week.    EIC is being closely examined this year, so if you claimed it, that may be why your return is being manually reviewed.    The fact that the IRS is manually reviewing your return should have no bearing on your state tax refund status.

Paycheck amounts range from "$5.00 to $25.00 for a 15- to 60-minute engagement," says Matt Wozniak, president and CEO of National Shopping Service. "The vast majority of mystery shoppers do not mystery shop for a living, although we have had a few earning over $40,000 a year. It's a great way to pick up a free pizza on your way to get the kids from soccer or get some free gasoline."  5. oDesk  Website: www.oDesk.com  Job Title: Various professionals    If you have experience in software development, Web design, language translation and other computer-based careers, oDesk can help you get hired for work at home.

Language Lab is looking to hire more English teachers.

HXW4i5Ajaa	A lot of this will depend upon the nature of the mortgage. What country are you in? I'll answer as though UK.    I don't think you can normally sign over a mortgage as such. There may be a special agreement with the lender, but I doubt it.    What you would normally have to do is apply for a new mortgage, and use that to pay off the existing loan.    That can have a number of issues.    If you  are in a contract period of the mortgage (Like a fixed rate period) then there will almost certainly be early payment charges.This can be more the longer the fixed period.    There may also be arrangement charges and fees for the new mortgage. You may even need a new valuation of the property.    Also with the current market, prices are falling. If the mortage is avove 75% of the value of the property, you may need to pay an indemnity fee.    Then there are legal fees. If you are taking a name off the mortgage, will you also be taking the name off the deeds?    While I doubt any one of those fees will be 5k, I can see them adding up to it in total without too much difficulty.|`|AA12349988	Depends on your small print - check with provider.

Mine was supposed to be deposited on 2/3, and now I have the 1301 code.  I've talked to the IRS 3 times, and they said that they don't know why.  They said it is "still processing".  They basically told me that they only know what I know from looking at the "Where's my refund" site.  I did my brother's taxes 2 days after mine, and he got his deposit last week.  I'm ticked!  Can't they at least have people that can give us more information after we stay on hold for 30 minutes?  Update us if you get your refund!

In order to qualify for a construction loan you are going to need 25% down before you can even get started    After you are complete you have to convert to a conventional loan, but your balance should be less then the appraised value, therefore no PMI.    If you are building yourself keep in mind that the bank is very strict about time lines, you still have only 6-9 months to get your property complete.
7hAT9iLQaa	We are both in similar situations!  I am even supposed to close on the 25th as well!  My scenario is differnet tho. i have a leak in the roof that can be repaired for 600 bucks or so.  The roof itself is ok, and the only issue is that one leak. i was told to get an estimate from an acredited company so that the lenders can look at it. with a FHA loan, they have the right to deny you the loan if they feel the cost of repair is too great- or so i have been told. i think with your situation (and i can be totally wrong), it doesnt have to do with the mold itself, but with the cost of repair. let me copy and paste the response i got from my hole from the lender: 'This appraisal is not acceptable at all.  This is an FHA loan these items need to be fixed otherwise we will not entertain this file.  Call me with any questions'.    can you beleive that!!!! The appraisal talked about the hole and this is what the lender said!  I am willing to fix it but i dont think that matters :(    good luck :-/
AA10934899	What do you mean, exactly? And, what state are you in?
NZuJR79oaa	They are required to provide you with a good faith estimate, which documents the fees they charge.  The total of these fees without points will range between $1,000 and $4,000. More is charged for riskier home buyers, first time home buyers, and those buying low cost homes.     Points are prepaid interest.  I recommend never paying points unless you are buying a home worth over $300K and you plan in staying in it for over ten years, and you are not going to pay down extra on the principle, at which point the lower interest rate MAY be worth it.  In general prepaying interest is a bad idea.      All fees are negotiable, especially the big ones.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Points are not prepaid interest.  It's a fee charged by the lender (1 point equals 1% of the loan amount) to lower the interest rate on the mortgage.    realtor.sailor

If it is, and you do - there's no "down payment" - it's added to her contract, and the additional premium is added into whatever type payment plan she has.

seIOpelgaa	Hiya, well Mastercard is based in the UK and this link takes you to their annual report for further information:    http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/...    Visa is a US incorporated company.  This link will take you to their SEC filings:-    http://investor.visa.com/phoenix.zhtml?c...    The reason they're on every card is that they each provide consumers, businesses and even governments with financial products using their own "brand".      As you can guess they are a sort of World bank in the credit business.  So if you were a financial business, Joe Bloggs Building Society, and want to do credit card business you might approach either and see who gives you (and your customers, though we all know customers come second!) the best deal according to what you are looking for.      In return Visa and Mastercard take care of the fiddly bits (and get paid for it, of course).  So while you might have an A&L Visa, it's actually a Visa credit card managed by A&L but taken care of by Visa.      Hope this explains.  I have tried to make it simple.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Nobody knows or cares where the Mastercard or Visa companies are located. Credit cards are issued by individual banks which are affiliated with the Mastercard or Visa networks. Cards with the Mastercard or Visa names are accepted worldwide.
NZuJR79oaa	No.  Most gasoline , natural gas, and oil is purchased on long term contracts.  Additionally, there is a cost to refining oil which is extremely high because our capacity for refining has not increased in this country since the 1970s.  Transporting the oil costs money as well.    I think they would prefer us to pay around $3/ gallon.  At four dollars we were taking action to produce our own oil reserves, at $2 and $3, not so much.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	They have shut down some of the oil rigs because we as consumers are not using as much as we use to.  By closing some of the rigs down they are not producing as much oil as they use to which in turn is raising the price at the pump.  It is all about profit!!!!! Opec wants to make more money (profit wise) so they shut down all of those oil rigs instead of leaving them open and have the price of gas go down.  They loved it when we were paying $4.00 per gallon or more for gas.
aqLLbzJQaa	Difficult to give a precise answer because council tax is based on a mythical 'rentable value' assessed by the local council - so a large flat/apartment in a desirable area of the city may be rated higher and therefore pay more council tax than a small house in a run down part of town.    Local councils are usually very good at giving out council tax ratings - so if you are interested in a flat/apartment ask at the local council offices for an exact charge.    Utility bills are also a bit difficult because they depend on how much of each service you use - in practice a small flat/apartment will probably be less than a house - but if for instance you live in a flat and keep the heating up high for days and days your utilities bill will be quite high - best way to get an assessment is to ask the previous occupant how much their bills were - or ask a friend who lives a similar life style to you in a similar flat.    ..

dJnRFpWWaa	I think its doubtful. There would be little stimulative effect to be obtained from extending the credit to home buyers who purchased in 2008. What you might want to concentrate your efforts on is the GOP Senators suggestion to get people who qualify refinanced into 4 to 4.5% fixed rate 30 year mortgages.     That would yield average monthly savings from between $250 to $700 per month in various geographic sections across the country. Collectively that would provide enormous savings and a percentage of those savings would be used to consume goods and services, a percentage would be saved, and a percentage would be productively invested in stocks and bonds.    I don't think this real estate financing proposal should be included in the current economic stimulus bill, but it is something that needs to be carefully and urgently considered. It won't stabilize home prices by itself. We need a foreclosure relief and mortgage debt restructuring bill to do that. But those two steps together would be very helpful to all homeowners, in my opinion.    To be more specific, I think a more logical starting point would be to begin with the second quarter of 2008, i.e., April 1, 2008. I don't know how they came up with the date of April 8. More importantly, if you can make the case that extending the credit throughout 2008 would provide an effective economic stimulus in 2009, then I'm sure the House and Senate  conference committee would give real consideration to such an extension.    Good luck. I hope you get your tax break.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Doubtful.  The intent of any expansion of credits is to stimulate homebuying from here forward.

It appears that you are going in to bat for your colleagues, if so then you must be sure that when the reaction comes they are 100% with you otherwise you will be dealt with as the 'whistle-blower' or 'ring-leader.  What you really need is for all the affected workers to  present a united approach. You should have a Contract of Employment and that should contain a section on 'Complaints Procedure'.

Trying to take on a group of superiors without some form of evidence, and, more importantly, support from other colleagues will leave you in a very vulnerable position.    In the first instance, look at the company grievance procedure and follow it to the letter if you wish to pursue any complaint.  You may have to make a separate complaint against each individual manager - it is unlikely that one all encompassing complaint will be sufficient to cover the alleged actions of each manager; they are very unlikely to be acting in unison.    If you are a member of a union, speak to your union representative immediately, you will need all the support (moral and legal) you can get before proceeding further.  Other options are to contact your local Citizens Advice for appropriate (free) assistance, or, if this is not possible, an employment lawyer.

Always make sure to verify a policy when making a reservation. When booking a car online, always review your rental terms and conditions, as some policies or aspects of it, may be location-specific.     None of the 8 car rental companies I checked, listed any vehicle restrictions related to the use of debit cards. There is an age restriction: you must be 25 years old to use a debit card. None of the car rental companies will accept debit cards in Canada.       Here are the basic policies I found, listed on the various company websites:     Alamo    When renting in the U.S., debit and check cards may only be used in conjunction with proof of a round trip travel ticket (airline, cruise ship or train) at time of rental.     A debit/check card is considered to be any non-credit card bearing the VISA, MasterCard or Discover Card logo.       For Almao, debit card policies listed no information as to the amount of hold required on the debit card.       Avis     Most U.S. locations also accept bank debit cards with the Visa or MasterCard logo as credit identification at the time of rental.   At an airport location you must also show:       A round trip airline ticket, e-ticket, or travel itinerary to or from the airport of rental, disclosing a return date and showing the renter's name       A valid U.S. passport or current U.S. military identification card. The name must match the name on the renter's U.S. issued driver's license       A current vehicle insurance card. The name and address must match the name and address on the renter's driver license; OR a current copy (within the last 60 Days) of your cellular phone bill, home telephone bill, bank statement or utility bill which shows your name and current address. Your name and address must match the U.S. issued driver's license in order to provide the renting location with proof of an accurate address.         Renting at an Off-Airport location you must show:       A current copy (within the last 60 days) of your cellular phone bill, home telephone bill, bank statement or utility bill which shows your name and current address. Your name and address must match your U.S. issued driver's license in order to provide the renting location with proof of an accurate address OR a valid U.S. passport or current U.S. military identification card. Your name must match the name on the your U.S. issued driver's license.       Debit card policies for Avis state that they may perform Debit Card authorization hold in excess of the estimated rental charges. When using a debit card at Avis there may be a minimum hold of up to $500 and a maximum hold of the estimated rental charges (if more than $500) will be placed on your account.     Upon returning the vehicle, Avis will process a release of any unused portion of the hold. Depending on your bank's procedures, the hold may take up to 2 weeks to be released by your bank.     Budget    When using a debit card, some Budget locations will check your credit with a national credit verification bureau. Other locations might not check your credit, but will require you to present a third form of identification:     For debit card customers renting at an airport location, one of the following is acceptable as a third form of identification in addition to a drivers license and debit card:     A round-trip airline ticket, e-ticket, or travel itinerary to or from the airport of rental, disclosing a return date and showing the renter's name     A valid U.S. passport or current U.S. military identification card     A current vehicle insurance card     A current copy (within the last 60 days) of the customer's cellular phone bill, home telephone bill, bank statement or utility bill     For debit card customers renting at an off-airport location, one of the following is acceptable as a third form of identification in addition to a drivers license and debit card:     A valid U.S. passport or current U.S. military identification card     A current vehicle insurance card     A current copy (within the last 60 days) of the customer's cellular phone bill, home telephone bill, bank statement or utility bill     Debit card policies for Budget state that they will generally require a hold of total estimated charges PLUS 25% or $300, whichever is greater. At select locations in the Northeast and North Central regions, the minimum authorization hold is $500. Budget suggests that customers look at the terms and conditions on your reservation confirmations for the deposit required at your specific rental location.

Ti0q1Btiaa	This may not  be what you're after, but let me give a simple example of team work.    When I worked on a sales floor, commission basis, the manager would have periodic contests.    For a given period, each salesperson would be partnered with another for a week.  The next week, each would have a different partner, until all had been partnered once, with each other.    At the end of the period, the sales of each team/partners were applied to each individual sales person.    The sales person with the highest total won a cash prize or bonus.    Can you see what this accomplished?    The lowest producer was paired with the highest producer at least once.    I can tell you that I pushed the hell out some of my partners to get on the ball, as I was too.    All of us pushed our partners to sell, sell, sell.    Management didn't have to do anything but stand by and watch the fun.

ZW0JHvdraa	Okay, I am going to offer you an honest answer based on my own experience, and on substantial research as well.    First of all, understand the difference between an online "JOB," versus a "Work At Home Business Opportunity," as there are distinct differences between the two.  An online "Job" (surveys, google, typing, etc) is just that.  It will not cost you anything to join, but your pay is based on various requirements, and you are working for an someone else.  A "WAH Business Opportunity" means that you can own your own business.  This ALWAYS requires an upfront fee, as well as monthly costs to run the business.    With that said, if you are in need of significant money fast to pay your rent, pay bills, etc., you should know that this usually does not happen overnight.  It takes time, a whole lot of hard work, and persistence.  Anyone who tells you that you can earn thousands overnight is scamming you.  If this was the case, everyone would be working online!  Common sense!      There are legitimate online businesses, but you absolutely must do your due diligence in researching first before joining any venture - especially now in this economy and hundreds of new scam artists everyday, looking to prey on the unemployed!      In summary, you need to have another resource of income to pay your bills while you are working online, as the latter will NOT pay your bills & put food on your table - certainly not right away.  Knowing the real facts up-front will put you one step ahead of the game, and will prevent you from either being scammed, and/or disappointed!    Good luck to you, and please be prudent in your research before commiting to anything!|`|uGrpNCS7aa	Yes.  It is True.     I am earning Rs.5000/- per month through this job.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	It was signed last night.    No one knows the exacts yet.    But it is a tax credit.   Basically you buy the house and then declare the credit on your tax return at the end of the year, just like any other tax credit.   As it stands the credit is 10% of your loan, up to 15k, it is not a specific amount.    The previous credit, 7500, which is active now, does not depend on purchase price, but there were strict income limits.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	It's hasn't been enacted yet.  Don't spend it.|`|mnnvnt61aa	If you are a homebuyer than you get 10% of what the house is worth up to $15,000 in your taxes, easy.|`|9wQBHmq5aa	But are those previously qualified for the $7500 housing tax credit grandfathered in to this new $15,000 housing tax credit?|`|X3xlImSEaa	Contrary to what the "Landlord" says, the $7,500 tax credit in 2008 tax law does limit the credit to 10% of the purchase price of a home bought between April 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009. It must be repaid over 15 years, interest-free, and is only available to first-time home buyers, or as worded in the law, you previously owned a principal residence any time during the previous three years. And while the credit does carry income exclusions, the exclusion does not kick in until reaching an adjusted gross income of $150,000 for taxpayers who are married and filing jointly, or $75,000 as the start of the phase out for single filers.    My understanding is that the $15,000 tax credit that has been passed only by the Senate would include any purchases made (not just "first" purchases or first within three years) and would NOT have to be repaid as a loan. However, with all the debate about the proposed stimulus package, I would not count on this credit if you are debating on whether to buy a home in 2009. It could change drastically by the time a compromise has been reached between the House, Senate and administration.    And while I agree that if it does pass that it should include a grandfather-clause to include those who qualified for the 2008 version of $7,500, I wouldn't count on that either. It would only seem fair, since that is a loan versus a straight credit, but it wouldn't surprise me if the Congress only includes new purchases for two reasons: 1) to keep the cost of the new credit down, as the stimulus is already reaching outlandish proportions; and 2) because they are more concerned with encouraging prospective buyers to act than worrying about what is fair for those who have already purchased.|`|xJi3ixgGaa	I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.

You will be paid back to $250k all right, the question is how much this money will be worth. The government is printing money right now. Consider this: if you bought 250k Zimbabwean bonds 30 years ago (in Zimbabwean dollars), you'd be paid that back today, but it would be worth a tiny fraction of a penny.    b. T-bills and other bonds are grossly overpriced right now. There is a whole slew of bonds (although not T-bills) that yield an effective 0% because they are sold at such a premium to their par value that the interest will simply make you whole without any profit. Thank to huge dislocations in the financial system created by the government.    c. There is no such thing as a riskless investment. Even buying gold carries risk. The only thing you can do is to manage risks and stack up odds in your favor.

nmozvlGPaa	Usually it's between 30 and 60 days after closing and here's why...    You pay the interest up to the day you close at the closing.  That means if you close on the 8th of the month, you generally pay interest costs to the end of that month at closing.  Then, mortgages are paid in arrears, meaning you pay for the month you just lived there (not the upcoming month).  So you live in the house for first full month and owe a payment at the end of that month.  That generally gets you between 30 and 60 days from the closing.    good luck!|`|AA11206283	30-60 days after closing.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Thirty to 45 days after closing.    realtor.sailor|`|UeLigNB0aa	30 days after closing|`|mnnvnt61aa	I bought a house on January 7, 2009 and my first payment isn't until March 1st, 2009.

If you close within the first few days of the month your payment will be the following month.  If you close in the middle-end of the month it will be the month after next.  So let's say you closed February 19th, you're first payment will be April.

Even if there is no loan involved there are still fees for processing the paperwork, recording the deed, etc.  Additionally depending on the agreement there may be payments to the buyer or to the seller to cover pro-ration items such as taxes, or annual fees already paid by the seller or to be paid by the buyer.

I'd open up two cards at the most. Maybe one secured card and one regular credit card.     The only two things that raise a credit score are 1- paying your bills on time and 2- paying off current debts. The old debts do need to be addressed, but don't think that paying them off will raise your score. It unfortunately doesn't work that way, despite popular belief.   Once you open your account(s), make sure you pay on time and if you can, pay in full each month. I always suggest that my clients buy everyday purchases (like groceries) with their cards. They are buying something they would buy anyway and the total doesn't get too high so it can be paid every month. Try not to carry balances from month to month if at all possible.    Personally, I wouldn't use the new cards to pay off old debt. Just start with the smallest amount you owe & work your way up. Try to settle the accounts and pay less than what you actually owe. Remember to request a letter or statement that shows the account is settled for your records.     Good luck!|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	start off with a max 1-3 cards.  too many won't help you. don't go applying for credit at every creditor you see. keep the inquiries to a bare minimum.  don't exceed half of the credit limit and pay your bills on time.      before you start rebuilding, i'd clear up any collections and derog first and foremost.  if that delays you applying for new credit, so be it.  it'll help your chances of qualifying for better terms.

You can find this time period for your state by going to the link below and looking under "Open Accounts."     http://www.creditinfocenter.com/rebuild/...    If your debt is older than the time period listed for your state, they can no longer defeat you in any court action because the debt is  time-barred.  --------------------------------------...  When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.    Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt (do not use regular mail) stating:    Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt, including a copy of the original signed application with my signature  --------------------------------------...  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector. It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.      When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.    Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation.

The tax on this amount is $2453.  This would then leave you with a refund of approx. $547.  This is if you have no other income, deductions or qualify for any credits.      As for claiming 2 on your W4, if you are satisfied with this refund then keep it the same.  If you want to receive a larger refund next year, then decrease the withholding to 1 or 0.

Bankers and lawyers obviously are contributing to society in order to make that kind of money, even if you don't think so. Although they aren't out improving life, in your view, I bet that the people who they help are incredibly grateful and think their lives have been improved.  It's not as though bankers and lawyers decide they want to earn money and suddenly do - you need to be good at your job and work your way up.  You can't exactly plan to "funnel out" people who are smart and earning a lot of money and force them to do something they don't like, for a lower salary.

e1jgTlEMaa	My job has a 360-degree review that is relatively useful, if time consuming.    You should set up a 1-on-1 with your manager and ask for some feedback.  Even if you don't think that the feedback is comprehensive, at least it will give you some insight into what your manager is thinking.    I've also seen people request informal feedback directly from their colleagues.  This sometimes works, but only if people feel comfortable enough to be honest.    Good luck!
6sTsIH05aa	You should be receiving your refund shortly, if you e-filed and instructed the IRS to direct deposit your money in your savings or checking account.  If there was no direct deposit, you should receive your check in about another week.|`|Cb64bfxeaa	Everything seems to be taking longer this year for a lot of people.

If you mailed it it will take about 5-6 weeks.
NrvrH4zQaa	On the bright side - several years ago I saw a study that showed that contributing to an IRA early in the year rather than April of the following year results in a portfolio tens of thousand dollars more at retirement.  Of course, this assumes that over time the portfolio has a positive return of 6 to 8%.  Whether that happens over the next 50 years is any body's guess.  You can set up a spreadsheet on your computer to prove it (and tweak the parameters).  Good luck.  BTW, you are NEVER going to pick the exact bottom, so stop trying!|`|dC6A5R5Saa	I think you perfected market timing, but only time will tell in the next few months.|`|AA10007793	You just defined market timing.

And the cost of compliance is less.
2N6oTOLQaa	First, you need to politely ask for as much info as possible. What is the schedule for cutting your hours and when will you be let go completely? When will your insurance benefits stop? etc. Also ask if you will receive any type of severance package.     Then, you need to start planning for life after this job. That includes 4 major tasks:    1. Look for a new job. Don't wait until you're completely out of work to start applying for new jobs. Start now and be aggressive. Your new full-time job is job hunting.    2. Look for ways to make something in the meantime. Maybe you can deliver pizza's in the evening or work at Wal-Mart or something. These may not be great jobs, but some income is better than nothing.     3. Cut every expense to the bare bones. Save every dime you can while you can. Cancel your cable subscription (keep the internet, you'll need that for job hunting). Start living on beans and rice and carpooling to save gas. Get drastic and build up savings like mad. Also, start selling stuff you don't need. Those old DVDs you never watch are worth a few bucks each on ebay. It all adds up.    4. Start living on a strict written budget. All your efforts from items 2 and 3 won't matter if you don't have control of your money. At the begining of each month set a written budget and stick to it. Everything that is a "want" is on hold right now until you get back on your feet no matter how good a sale may seem.|`|8uqbNrICaa	Ask your boss for a meeting and go over all your concerns. As for your insurance you should be able to get COBRA (if you can afford it) once the company coverage lapses.    Go to your states unemployment commission and start the application process now. States have different rules so I can't be specific here. For instance the state I'm in allows you to work up to 3 days a week and still collect benefits. It also requires a 1 week period where you don't get benefits. (the reason for starting now) While you're there go over the job openings they have.    Network, network, network ask all your friends, business acquaintances, and anyone else you know to see if they are aware of any openings where they work.    Then get dressed up smartly and go door to door putting in applications everywhere. You will get lots of "no we're not hiring" but persevere and keep going. This economy will turn around eventually.    Try cutting back now on wasteful spending so you can stretch your resources as far as you can.    AND -- GOOD LUCK!|`|UwTB8gM4aa	Under COBRA, you will have up to 18 months of health insurance.  The good news is that the premium amount for the health insurance will be the same (group rates are always cheaper than individual rates).  The bad news is that YOU will pay 100% of the premium.      Meanwhile start looking for a new job YESTERDAY!  The maxim that "it's always easier to find a job when you still have one" is absolutely true.    As for what you should ask your boss, start with this question, "What is the company offering in terms of re-training, assistance finding new jobs, severance pay, carrying benefits forward (and for how long)?    Good luck in your job search!|`|14b55b2c0493a3dba8b107800bc6ac4aaa	wow, sorry to hear that! Keep a positive outlook and defenetly follow what these guys above are saying! i would say the same things they said.      the biggest thing would be, for you to start looking as of right now and cut down on spending! Those two things will help a lil. good luck.|`|EVwllMNqaa	SORRY..No go way to prepare start saving money and looking for new job
8xDOEr63aa	No. Do not take out a loan.    Your startup costs are relatively small compared to other ventures. Get creative and industrious and find ways to make the extra $5,000.     Don't do debt. Why? Because there are few guarantees in business, but one of those guarantees is you are going to make mistakes. It is better to preserve your cash flow and not have it being siphoned off into loan payments so that you can overcome those mistakes you are going to make.|`|4hJJkfmpaa	i would talk to your banker and ask them what would be the best opion

Qqz0H2hEaa	Do not pay attention to what people have their house listed for.  Look at how much houses have sold for within the last three to four months.    In my area there are houses that are overpriced and sit for months on end.  And there are houses that sell in a few weeks.    You should be able to get hard data on recent sales so that you can make a good decision.  You should also call a different Realtor if you don't trust that one.  This time ask friends and family if they know a Realtor they trust.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Ask the Realtor to provide you with a CMA - competative market analysis.  This will show the price of comparable properties, bot for sale and recently sold.  This should be part of the Realtor's listing presentation.  If he/she won't find another realtor.    realtor.sailor|`|23SkYEw5aa	you should always interview at least 3 full time, LOCAL realtors.    If asked about what you believe the house is worth, say market value.  Don't give numbers.  Let THEM tell you what the house is worth AND WHY.      Part of the presentation the realtor does, is to explain how they arrived at their figures; and using the CMA is key.    I have no idea why he wouldn't show you the CMA.  You should have been able to review it.   Maybe not get a copy, but you should have been able to review it in detail with the agent.    The bottom line is not if the agent is dishonest, but that you don't like this agent or trust them.  So for that reason, your ONLY option is to move on to someone else.  PERIOD.|`|eytlIKITaa	Did the realtor do a cost analysis on your house?  I would contact a different realtor and see what they would price your house at.|`|UjFKq4wpaa	Realtors compare your house to recent sold homes, similar in size and features to come up with a fair market value.  The fact that there are other homes on the market for sale at a 20% higher prices, may not mean much really since they have not sold, asking price is a "wish" and not a fact.    Before making a decision, visit with a second (even a 3rd) Realtor and compare their figures.  Stick to facts not to what you, as a seller want to hear since that would be a mistake that may cost you not selling your house.      I JUST READ YOUR LAST NOTE.  THAT REALTOR SOUNDS LIKE A CROOK ALRIGHT.  GET REFERRALS FROM FRIENDS, FAMILY OR CO-WORKERS.  DROP THIS ONE!|`|hxG4zLX5aa	you can list your house for a million dollars- that doesn't mean that's what it's worth.  as others have said, he should provide you with a CMA.  the fact that he won't proves that he's a con.  you should definately check with another few realtors but they all get paid on commission so their motivation could be the same as the first guy.  you might consider having an appraisal done on your house to see what an unbiased professional thinks.  make sure he includes actives as well so you can see what has sold and the best competitive homes available for sale- not the highest priced.|`|ios63aq5aa	Here in England, there is an infallible rule of thumb when dealing with Estate Agents (realtors) or lawyers:    If you can see their lips move, they are invariably lying ;-)|`|cXtEx98Haa	Based on just what you have told us, I agree that it looks like he's trying to scam you or something, or maybe he's just an idiot.  Either way, realtors are a dime a dozen, sign with somebody else.|`|r67YzIv5aa	I expect seller's to talk to other agents when they are looking to sell, it just makes sense.  You need to know who knows your area better and how to get the most for your home.  If the agent did not show you the CMA, he's wrong.  I will bring a copy for the seller and one for me, that way they can keep it and see the differences between mine and the other agents.  Be careful, the agent may want the home for him/her self.
5EDNrOi3aa	I know how you feel, cause I actually had all these codes showed up last year. Only because i was randomly selected for my return to be looked at manually.

Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted proccessing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?|`|g8ZvrrHDaa	Yep, mine too.  It said by the 10th before.    BUT, my bank has already received it and is going to credit my account today when they update the deposits.  YAY!|`|mk5Mnaj4aa	Yes, finally mine was updated this morning too.  I was on the phone last night for a long time though and after many calls that were disconneted due to call volume, but the rep didn't even want to look at my account because it hadn't been three weeks.  Then I kept (nicely) questioning her about the changed dates and told her I was concerned I had made a mistake...she then finally looked at my actual "account" and was able to tell me it would be in on the 6th (a week after I should have gotten it).  But I am glad to at least have an answer and hope they get this all figured out so that all the filers don't have to go through this waiting game.  Most of us a hurting for our cash they are using...without interest I might add!|`|x9HeKIyxaa	Mine should have been deposited today and i havent seen anything.  Should i call my bank?
hc9PgibAaa	Sounds right.  Persons making less than $8000 are generally not even required to file a tax return because their tax obligation is zero.  You have a dependent and you are getting your recovery rebate and your EIC you are getting a refund because of your tax credits.  Depending on how much you make next year you probably won't get as large of a refund because you won't get the recovery rebate every year.    Congrats :)
c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	If you have earned income of 3600.00 you would owe 551 in self employment tax, get a credit for 50 percent of SS paid of it against your taxable income,have no tax liability after your standard deduction and 2 exemptions, have nothing withheld, not qualify for the child tax credit or additional child tax credit and have $1233 for an earned income credit. This means a refund of 682. In a nut shell.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	BTW, your "estimate" is only correct if the $3600 was from a W-2.  If it's self-employment income, you owe $508 in SE Tax and your income isn't 3600, but $3345, and EIC would be $1131.    As for your under-the-table-work this year, don't be surprised if you get a letter asking you to prove you actually had this income.  That is, produce the 1099-Misc, bank deposit slips or get a letter from the payer.|`|AA11173563	no because there is such a thing as self employment taxes as well|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	You're correct, a refund presumes money paid in.  You do owe self-employment taxes on the income you earned, but it would be a very small amount.  Wouldn't it be better to talk to a tax preparer and be really sure what your status is?    It's possible that returns are not needed, but only someone who is trained in the tax code can tell you for sure.  (You don't want a small thing to come back and bite you years down the road.)

lERouzRYaa	In the example you gave, they are saying that they are intrested in buying ONE (1) 2009 OR NEWER DODGE DURANGO SXT 4X4 OR EQUAL. The person who submits the lowest bid gets to sell the County the vehicle.    A Sheriffs sale is usually held at the Courthouse and can be for various things, properties with unpaid taxes, items including cars and trailer houses that have been confiscated, etc. I don't think that these sales are online or well advertised. They may be in the "Legal Notices" section of the want ads of your local newspaper. They are also posted on a bulletin board or other easily visible place at the courthouse. These are auction type sales where the highest bidder gets ownership of the offered item.

0JoWTQWoaa	It is possible to get your state refund before your federal. I have received both my state refunds (MS and VA).  I am scheduled to receive my federal tomorrow. I have always been scheduled for 2/6 though.  My federal refund was not delayed for any reason.    Okay you answered you own question with your additional details.  You received your state refund before your federal.  Due to the fact that your refund date has been pushed back, there may be an error on your return that the IRS is fixing.  Therefore, it is possible for you to receive your state refund even though there is a problem with your Federal.  Use common sense.|`|IqNLR5BBaa	I usually receive my state (SC) before my federal.
z2Yk76RAaa	I talked to the IRS 5 times and finally got a supervisor. Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted proccessing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?|`|SdTQVUaKaa	I too got the same answer as Big Slick. That there was an error and fixed manually and pushed back into the cycle. I was told yesterday I would have my refund next week, however, WMR states 2/24 as well. I've thrown my hands up in the air as far as a date to expect it. I'm already going through an eviction because of this, nothing I can do to force the gov't to pay my money back. Good luck to all.|`|QxWMc2Kdaa	Mine was filed on January 18th with a DD of Jan 30 per TaxAct.  When I checked WMF on Monday, it was showing 2/10.  When I checked it this morning, the date had changed to 2/6 saying that there was an error on the stimulus and that they had fixed it and I would be receiving my $$ on the 6th plus an additional $300.  Can't Wait.

No.2 The crisis in the banking system is due a sever loss of confidence. ALL banks are currently facing a virus like distrust of each other. Why? Bank A wants to borrow funds from Bank B but bank B doesn't know if Bank A will ever really be able to pay the money back. Its a classic Catch22 type situation dammed if you do & dammed if you don't.    No.3 The banking crisis is unlike ANYTHING EVER seen before in the modern history of financial markets. This is because we recently a few years back moved into a Global form of capitalism, ALL major banks have become inter-connected banking corporations which span the planet due to computer networks like the internet.    No.4 EVERYONE who works in banking is now at a complete loss as to how to fix this crisis, why? because its a mess based on first greed and secondly now fear. ALL the politicians, bankers, banks, & ordinary people are all out of their depth and nobody really knows how to fix this broken banking system. If we are not careful here in the UK we could still end up like Iceland or Japan.    No.5 whats also clear is that Gordon Brown doesn't have the answers but he's NOT pretending unlike David Cameron. Cameron has even less of an idea on how to fix things.

8xDOEr63aa	You are probably o.k. but just to be safe you can shop around for identity theft insurance.    Check out these guys:  http://www.zanderins.com/idtheft/idtheft...    When identity theft occurs, you are not responsible for repaying the money someone else stole in your name. You are responsible for cleaning up the bad information on your credit history, talking with the affected banks, burning all kinds of time and effort cleaning it up. But you aren't on the hook for the money.    A good ID theft insurance plan will assign a counselor to do the legwork for you.    The other course of action you can take is put a credit freeze on all of your credit agency reports. It will cost you about $20 to $30 total.    You contact the three bureaus here:  http://www.transunion.com/  http://www.experian.com/  http://www.equifax.com/    You won't be able to get new credit until you unfreeze them. But committing to a debt free and credit secure lifestyle is worth it.    It sounds like not even these steps will ease your worries. For you to be utterly miserable about this is not o.k. Your reaction to this seems to be a symptom of a greater problem that might need professional help.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Yes, you need therapy.
AA11627382	Pros :   Ithink from the Organisations point of view it was a very good deal since operating cost had skyrocketed due to the rise in Crude. For a flight be it overbooked or half empty the operating costs remain the same and due to the pre-recession tremors felt in the US market there was a marked decrease in consumer spending over the Ariline industry. IT gives them an option to share resources mainly Line personnel and the maintenance personnel , it reduces operational costs since it pools in Hangar spaces for Maintenance .Airlines spend huge amounts in leasing out Hangar Spaces at Airports as well The Customers get a good deal since they have a increased routes available throughout the north-american continent and the Atlantic/Pacific as well . The combined Delta-Northwest airline will be in a better position to steal away the most profitable fliers from rival airlines, namely, business travelers who fly across oceans often. Delta has a strong network across the Atlantic and a pretty good one in Latin America, while Northwest has a strong network across the Pacific.    Cons :    Who loses?   First, many travelers will see the cost of flying rise in the next few years because this merger will likely cause United and Continental to merge, too. The result of these mergers will be to reduce competition and allow airlines to raise their prices and cram their planes even fuller than they already are    The second group to lose is leisure travelers who collect Northwest frequent flier miles through points-based credit card programs. Many changes will water down the value of your points. For example, the threshold for redeeming tickets will likely rise from 20,000 miles (the current standard for members of Northwest's WorldPerks program) to 25,000 miles (the current standard for Delta's SkyMiles program), according to the Wall Street Journal. On the positive side, if you're a business traveler who flies, say, 100,000 miles a year, you may see more choices and better rewards in these mileage programs.    Third, fliers in Memphis will be hurt. They have had, until now, many flight choices on Northwest out of their local airport. The combined new company will likely stop flying many of these routes, encouraging customers to fly out of Atlanta instead. However, in a year's time, Southwest or another airline may move into the Memphis market,  Same applies for many small cities and towns as mergers result in less service to small markets    Delta and Northwest were unable to get their pilots to agree on issues about pay, hours, and seniority. So pilots are likely to have "work slowdowns" for years to come, as a negotiating tactic, which will annoy fliers as well as company bosses.     To put this issue in context, when US Airways merged with* America West, the airlines merged without sealing a deal with pilots. The result? The pilots are still fighting among themselves many years later.     On the positive side, Delta's CEO has run both companies at different times, and he has made a deal to boost the pay and perks of Delta's pilots, which may "buy" him their cooperation.
8xDOEr63aa	Have him pull his credit report to find out about other outstanding debts.    If the debt has been sold to collections agency, then the original company holding the debt is through with it. The company probably sold it to the collection agency for $.10 on the dollar.    My advice is offer them settlements. They will stake make a profit on the debt they purchased so they will be willing to do this.    Do not give them electronic access to your checking, do not send them any personal checks with your banking information either. These people are by and large crooks and they will clean you out.    Your boyfriend needs to get it in writing that they have made an offer that is a settlement in full before he pays anything. Photocopy the check or money order and staple it to the settlement letter and your boyfriend must keep this letter the rest of his life. Because they will try and get him for more $$$ later.    Do not pay any of this for him. This is his mess, he is responsible for it. This is basic adulthood stuff he should be willing to do... otherwise all you are is his mommy. I see a dark future.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	From a credit standpoint, once a debt has gone into collections, the damage has been done. The damage will not look any less severe if you pay it one way (in full) or the other (partial). Just make sure that you request something in writing that the debt has been paid in full in case you need to send it as proof to the credit bureaus.    Once it's been sold to a collection agency, it is off the books with the original creditor. At that point, you would need to work with the collection agency to settle the debt.     Pull his credit report from all three bureaus (Trans Union, Equifax and Experian) to see if there are any other collections in his name. Go to www.annualcreditreport.com and you can pull them for free. No scores (you have to pay for those), but you can still see the reports.    Good luck!|`|un67D8QTaa	call the credit agancy or union or the card company and they will answer

BK30XyGraa	There are no hard and fast benchmarks for when to make the shift from sole trader to limited company status and every situation is different. You must look at and consider what either option would bring to your business.     Being a sole trader is the simplest way to run a one-person business, you make all of the decisions and of course you get to keep all of the profits. If you are at a stage where operating as a sole trader is working for you then retaining that legal status may be advisable. However, as a sole trader you are personally responsible for any debts run up by your business, which could mean that your home or other assets are at risk. Upgrading your business status to that of a limited company will mean increased legal, financial and administrative implications.     However, if you want to expand, a limited company status offers protection of your assets should you get into financial trouble - your liability is limited to the cost of the shares. Trading as a limited company offers other advantages such as easier securing of funding from your bank, or issuing shares to raise finance. In addition, your business finances are clearly separated from your personal finances and it is often thought of as more prestigious by customers or suppliers.     Business Link for London has produced a fact sheet covering the various types of business structures, including the pros and cons of each:   http://www.businesslink4london.com/formi...|`|e49bc7cb6c53df85c09de682b62a95eeaa	I agree that a sole trader would be preferable.    There are a couple of points you might consider which could just make a company worthwhile.    If you have to commit to large payments up front, such as hall hire, then you could run the risk of a loss if you failed to sell places on the course.      Also in a limited company environment the workers could have shares in the company and paid their share of profits by means of dividends.    But I still feel that a company would probably be a unnecessary     complication for you.|`|at3fTytsaa	I agree that a sole trader would be easiest for you.

The IRS will review the case and issue you the rightful amount you are due.  If they do deem that you are the rightful person to claim the children, they will go after your daughter's boyfriend to return the money that he was issued incorrectly by claiming the children.    Just be aware that on a personal level, it could be very problematic once the IRS catches up to him.|`|GgzEUraraa	If he did not provide any support for them, than legally he cannot claim them. If you provided over HALF of their support, then legally you CAN claim them, but NOT if he has already claimed them. The law will probably not raise any questions if he claims them, but they cannot be claimed twice as a dependent (by you and him).|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Since they lived with you all year, you have the right to claim them.     What you need to do is send in your tax return as soon as possible. The bad news is that you cannot e-file. If you try to e-file, the computer will cross-check the children's social security numbers and reject your return because someone else has already claimed them.     Send in paper copies of your tax forms and claim the children just like you would if the boyfriend hadn't claimed them. The good news is you can still use tax software (if you choose) and you just print your completed and filled out forms at the end instead of submitting electronically.     When the IRS sees that 2 people claimed the same kids on their taxes, they will contact both parties and ask for additional information to prove who really had the right to claim the kids. When they do, you submit the information they ask for and you'll get your refund. They will adjust the refund for the boyfriend who illegally tried to claim the kids to reflect the fact that they are not really his deduction. If they think he intentionally lied about it, they may also charge him with tax fraud. But regardless of what happens between the IRS and the boyfriend who illegally claimed them, you will get your refund reflecting the fact that they really are your deductions to claim.    Obviously, the other bad news for you is that this whole mess will delay your refund. The IRS will have to wait to sort out who really gets the deduction before either you or the boyfriend get your refunds.    Also, if you are single, I believe you should be able to file for head of household status. Double check though that you qualify even though they are not techincally your children. If you're married, then you probably want to file a joint return anyway because MFJ is better than HOH almost everytime.

It should cover all the aspects you need to start a small business. That is,.the plan must contain a clear and precise description of your product or service, estimated start-up and operational costs, and complete details on how you will market your product or service.

These factors affect both distribution cost, and suggested retail cost in the different countries where Amway products are sold.|`|0849b668f5686ef8f66ab243f452a611aa	Yes, products are priced to be competitive with similar products in the same category in that country.

zmqN0M86aa	Cougarcub's right.  If you have already bought the house in 2008, you won't be eligible.  It becomes effective on the date the bill is signed (if it's signed, it still has to go through the senate) and is not retroactive.  You'll still be eligible for the $7500 tax credit though.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	The bill will not be retroavtive, but it sounds like you can refinance and use the credit.   It is not 15k, that is just the cap.  It is 10% of the loan, so loans under 150k would have a smaller credit.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you'd listen to the news, you'd know that it's just a proposal at this point.  Nothing has been enacted in law.|`|mnnvnt61aa	The $15,000 tax credit isn't a first time hoem buyers tax credit, it is simply a HOME-BUYERS tax break.  Any home buyer can get it.    However there is a $7,500 FIRST TIME HOME BUYER'S tax credit and if your wife wasn't on the deed with the old house, she technically didn't own a home, so it would be her first time.    Also remember the 7500 tax credit isn't free money, it is simply a interest free loan.  They give it to you in your taxes and give you 15 years to pay it back interest free through your taxes.  I'm not sure if the $15,000 is going to be the same.|`|6pdsC9REaa	It should be on the Presidents desk by Feb 17 to be passed into law...|`|xJi3ixgGaa	It is my understanding that it is NOT retro active.  The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter.  Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place.  The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.      HOWEVER this is where a lot of people don't understand.  Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000.  You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000.  You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10.  If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars.  For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.

I would lean towards reading on the subjects of a business administration major. You can start now at the library. If you really want to stand out, try accomplishing your goals without outsourcing your manufacturing to another country. I have not bought anything made-in-China since 2007. This is my second year in a row with the same resolution. So now I need tennis shoes. If you make me a pair, that would be good. I'd pay extra.

The exchange is done in electronic accounts, you do not have exchange cash, you just need an account with a trader.|`|0191j9waaa	it is working like following:    1. every bank have some different international curency reserves.  if you buy from them they can give you , but they have to get those money from relative countries, like us$ from usa, rmb from china. it is the bank where you purchase the money give you the money.    2. how can they get those money? they have two kind of ways to get that money:    one : they use international settlement money ( like us$, euro, etc ) to buy  the currency ( rmb, AU$, etc.) they need from relative countries' bank ( people's bank of china, bank from austrilia, etc );  second: they use gold to buy the currency they need.|`|MSO4B2tVaa	This is a loaded question. Forex is all electronic and over the counter. No central location. Forex dealers act as sort of a middle man between buyers and sellers.|`|jZMDYsVOaa	Forex traders trade exclusively "Over the Counter" (OTC), meaning that all deals take place between the buyer and the seller, with no stock-market mediation. This unique aspect allows the private traders, with or without experience, to trade in a market in which companies and corporations actively participate as well. This market's great liquidity allows the trader to withdraw his funds at anytime.    The buying and selling is done by the broker and any + / - is also done from you broker trading account and only profit is transferred to your account.    Regards
3ExcyAJaaa	Playing Forex can appear alluring, but the majority  of people who try it lose money.  All you have to do is do a web search on the words "Forex" and "lose" to see this is the consensus.    Forex is what we call a "zero sum" game.  You are making a bet with someone else about whether a currency will rise or fall.  For every winner there has to be a loser.  If you are smarter than the average player, you may make money.  If you are dumber than the average player, you are likely to lose money.  Most of the people making the "bets" in Forex are highly trained professions at banks and other institutions.  You are unlikely to beat them at this game.     Actually  Forex is not quite a zero sum game.  It's a slightly negative sum game as the Forex broker takes a small percentage each time in the spread.  It's a small amount but over a hundred trades, it ends up being a considerable amount of money.  So the average player is likely to lose money, and remember the average player is a highly trained professional and probably smarter than you.    There is a lot of luck in Forex, and if you play it, you will have some periods of time where you make money.  This is usually because you are having a lucky streak, not because you have suddenly become an expert Forex player.  However, most people are unwilling to admit their success is due to luck. They become convinced they have a system that works, and lose a lot of money trying to refine it.    I would recommend not trying to do Forex at all, unless you are a trained professional.  It's like playing poker with people better than you, with the house constantly taking a small percentage from the pot.|`|WgT5l14baa	Yes.  Forex is a good thing to have in any trading portfolio because it adds diversification.    You should probably not be dealing in forex because of the way you phrased your question.  Forex is a trading vehicle, not a long term investment.  In trading stocks, the stock market going up or down makes no difference.  If it's going up, you make money going long.  If it's going down, you make money going short.  To make money in forex, you have to be comfortable trading both sides of the market.  The fact that your question seems to equate going down with "bad" or the absence of money making opportunity concerns me.|`|0191j9waaa	do not get involved in it if you want to keep you money!  it is kind of money gambling!    do not waste your time checking or asking about it. do some actual business which you can see something!|`|VtBnLXQzaa	forex is definitely one of the options with vast potential in making money but only if you have the right skill, technique and strategies developed to profit from it. if you are still trying to figure it out, get into this site and register to download a Free Forex Ebook and a Free Demo account as well. all the best.|`|jZMDYsVOaa	I would assume that with the onset of recession (if/when it happens) there will be much more uncertainty in the market, which leads to a withdrawal of highly speculative money, which in turn lowers liquidity, and which increases volatility.

f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	It depends on how much the house is worth compared to how much she paid for it.  If she would owe income tax on the profit (anything over $250,000), then you should consider renting the house and letting her leave it to the children as part of her estate.  The house would be inherited at current market value.  If the children sell it after inheriting it, there would be no income tax.  You should consult a tax professional and/or estate lawyer.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if there is more than one child, why doesn;t she just sell it first and split the money that way? she may have capital gains taxes to pay if she has not lived in it 2 of the last 5 years|`|UDxL7lPqaa	She (and you) need to consult an estate attorney first.  There are legal, title and tax risks if it isn't done correctly.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Anything over $13,500 is taxable.    What she should do is sell the house herself. Then gift out in $13,500 increments to everyone of her children (and grand children) thus it's not taxable.|`|WgT5l14baa	This should be done with an attorney specializing in financial and estate matters.  The fee will be cheaper than the cost of making a mistake.  A lot depends on the market value of the house and mom's cost and her tax situation and your tax  situation.  It's really more complicated than it sound and if done wrong, your family could end up paying thousands in taxes that they don't have to.
44435ac38b755e42d6164067b0413d71aa	There's a ton of helpful information and suggestions about how to repair your credit at the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...    The basic way to do it is to contact the 3 big credit tracking companies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, and to file your side of the story with them.      You are entitled to a free annual credit report via the page sponsored by the FTC https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/i...  which is sponsored by the Federal Trade Commission.      Read the FTC pages, then do what they suggest - they are very helpful.|`|oojO4WAraa	contact Experian and TransUnion (the major credit report agencies), explain your problem and have the apartment complex tell the credit report agencies that their dispute with you is resolved.  Google TransUnion or Experian, they have 800  s.|`|2xO8AxYRaa	You need to get a letter from the complex stating that this was a mistake. Send a copy of this letter with a letter to all 3 reporting bureau disputing this, also send a copy to the collection agency. The reporting bureau will (should contact collection agency verifying the debt) this hopefully will fix the problem. If not seek out an attorney that specializes in FDCPA and see if he will take on this case. The main problem here is the proof that you need and that is the letter from the complex.    Good Luck
050f4f566669f66e5c10bb3cd194427daa	Actually, you're better off with neither. To really succeed in this profession, I highly recommend NOT obtaining a a degree in PR or communications. Instead, pursue a business administration degree with a major in marketing, and then take several PR and journalism classes as electives, or to obtain a minor. The reality is that PR pros need to understand and know all aspects of business inside and out, and no PR or journalism degree can deliver that knowledge.    Secondly, you really need to know how to write, and write well. You also need to know how to spell, and pay attention to detail.    Finally, be prepared to start off with a relatively low annual salary...probably in the high 20s or low to mid-30s. PR pros must pay their dues before working their way up to positions that carry more responsibility and have greater compensation.|`|kzDWhoi6aa	If you posess a degree - or any extra qualification - then you'll already be in front of of the crowd when it comes to hunting for jobs. My friend has a degree and he wasn't sure what direction to go with it, eventually he went in a completely different direction, he earns his keep from Google. Have a look at the site below.|`|PhyALUKJaa	You can earn a degree in public relations at various four year colleges across the country. Many larger public state colleges offer degrees specifically labeled as public relations while other schools offer degrees where public relations skills are taught while not specifically labeling the degree as public relations.     At a school where you can earn a degree in public relations you will most likely be part of a larger journalism and/ or communications school where degrees in broadcasting, print journalism and advertising will also be offered in addition to public relations. You will take many of the same classes a journalism student however your final or upper level classes will be more focused on public relations. Many people in Journalism often will switch to public relations in their career so earning a degree in journalism would not disqualify you at all for any pr position.    Because public relations is a broad subject you will find that many people do not have degrees in PR but succeed in the field. You need to know how to write and communicate effectively, strategically and concisely and this is a skill that many with other degrees have. Still a degree in public relations is the best way to stand out and shows you are very dedicated and focused on the specific discipline.    PR differs from other fields in the sense that experience, internships, etc. mean more than in other fields. PR agencies for example don't have development programs where they recruit at colleges and take a large class of entry level positions. You will need to have an impressive resume.    PR professionals should expect to earn starting salaries of around 27-35k, however promotions come quick and it is a relatively young profession. It is not uncommon to see VPs in pr in their early 30's.    Basics of the job include researching the field of the company you are working for/client, building relationships with the media, writing press releases, brochures.

l0uJlMaWaa	Typically the younger you are the more risk you can take.  The reason for this is because you have many years for the market to return.  If you are close to retirement a more conservative investment may be appropriate especially if you will need to use all of the money in a short time frame.    If you have 15+ years until retirement I definitely wouldn't make changes to your investments so long as your asset mix is comfortable.  Many experts (John Bogle) say to take your age and use that number as the percent you should be invested in Bonds (age 30 should have 30% invested in bonds 70% stock).  This is more on the conservative side but will allow you to see if your current asset mix is somewhere in the ballpark.      But to change everything based solely on what the market has done isn't necessarily what you want to do.  Keep in mind that stock prices are very low right now.  You are able to purchase more shares for less money than you could one year ago.|`|TOPJybbsaa	Everyone lost money in the past few months. But the market is low now, so it's a good time to switch from money market to stocks. You have a long way to go, and over the long term the market has return about 10 percent a year.     Since you are young and can take some risks, consider putting a very small amount, maybe only 1,000 or even less, into a new IPO that is coming soon. It's a start-up with good potential, and any start-up is risky, but your investment could grow 10 or 20-fold or more if it succeeds. You seldom are able to get in on a ground floor for such a small amount.

The rule of thumb is to have the same percentage as your age in bonds and fixed income and the rest in stocks.

Or it could be that the guy who just walked in the door is a personal friend of the manager. I would in a calm manner ask the manager to talk with you either before your shift or after it, and discuss your concern, let him know that you would like to work more hours and what you need to do to get more hours.  He will then be in a position to offer constructive criticism.  Remember it is in his best interest for his employees to succeed, so he will give you good advice on what needs to be improved upon.  It could be that he doesn't realize you want more hours.     Or it could be a policy to give people good hours starting out so they will stay, then gradually cut them back so that they have a staff of 20 people in order to have people available if someone doesn't show up,  this happens a lot in fast food places.

They process their DD's at night, so about 2 to 5 am Mountain time you will see a "pending deposit" w/funds available in your account. In the funds available, you should be able to tell looking at the available balance and your refund whether they are choosing to hold part or not.     So for example, let's say your refund is $2000. Tomorrow morning you look and your balance has increased by $2000, then they aren't holding any of it. But if its only increased $1000 they are holding the rest.

HFKr2vBsaa	If you quit a job, in the US many or most states, you will not be able to collect benefits plus you will have to explain yourself to prospective employers which can go badly if not worded well.    It is much better to be let go during a layoff because it's so common now. Or if you want to quit, go ahead and start looking for another job before you quit.  It is always better to have a job when looking for one.

Y7l9w11Maa	The key is in your own question... "..lease option *contract*.."    You may ask them if theyd be willing to take their money back (and as other answerers stated the renters rarely follow through with the option) and then as long as both parties agree, you CAN break the contract.    However...if they still have it in their heads they might want to purchase the house one day, there is no way to break the contract.  If you tried, they didn't agree and you went to court over it, you could potentially lose more money than what they paid for the lease-option.    If you choose to discuss this with them, they may be more than happy to have their money back.  (With the economy the way it is, they might need it.)  Simply talking it over with your tenants might be the best option.  If they don't agree, you're out of luck - either follow through with the sale or lose extra $$ (and potentially be forced to sell the house).|`|AA11206283	As long as that change is covered by the option, yes.

It is not a DIY project.    Honestly though, the odds of the renter exercising their option are almost zero.     Very few people actually improve their credit enough to qualify for a loan.    If they do not qualify at the end of the contract (usually 2 years) you get to keep the house and the money, pretty good deal for you.

I have been working at home successfully for the past 2 years so I know what works.    There are many work-from-home programs on the Internet today that will promise you the world, however most of these programs don't deliver on their promises. If you aren't careful you will end up joining a work-from-home program that just takes your money and leaves you with an empty pocket.    I know from firsthand experience which programs actually work and which ones will just steal your money. See, two years ago when my company was having layoffs I was worried about losing my job, so I started searching the Internet for ways to create a part-time second income.    After investing 8 months of my time and over $5700 in bogus money making programs I finally found a few work from home programs that actually work. Of the 28 programs I signed up for only one of them made me money. I have provided a review of this powerful system which you can check out.    I am now happy to say I no longer have a job with my previous company. No, I wasn't laid off, I retired just 6 months after I started using this system. I have been consistently earning between $15,000 and $22,000 per month using this work from home system.    Check it out and I hope this is the answer you've been looking for.|`|6sTsIH05aa	There are very few legitimate work from home jobs online.  Most are scams where they ask you for money up front.

There are so many confused folks out there thinking that if they type in search engines Work From Home Jobs they are going to find a JOB they shows them opportunities to work at home.  The only things on the world wide web you will find under that category are various sites promoting multi-level marketing business opportunities, direct selling, wholesalers, and other internet scams of companies that are not credited.  What I learned is some jobs that allow you to work from home have career demands of a computer technician, web server, networking maintaince, and don't pay much unless you are your own independent contractor and market your own skills.    I have been in the network marketing business field since I was 18 years old and I am not a millionaire but I wanted to be.  Upon my search for the right company I later learned that it wasn't just the company that had to be right and in good financial standing but myself be willing to work for my home based business.

This is the first thing that companies check for proof of address, so if you're not on it, you have no chance of getting anywhere because it's almost as if you don't exist in credit land.  Each local authority is different in terms of how often they update the registers, but this shouldn't take more than two months.  Since you don't actually have any debts, this might be all it takes.    Next, apply for a credit card from your own bank.  You might think that you don't want one for whatever reason - maybe the temptation to spend - but you need to build up your credit rating.  The reason why I say from your own bank is that it sounds like you already have a good relationship with them and they can see that there are wages going into your account on a regular basis.  And usually, the bank that holds your current account is not too picky - I got one when I was only temping.    If you can't get a phone contract, then you won't get store cards either so don't worry about that.  They do the same kind of checking to see if you're eligible.  I wouldn't sign up to catalogues on principle - as far as I know, the only catalogues which check your credit are those like Next that you actually have to pay for - so it's not worth it if you don't really want it and you're just doing it to boost your credit rating.    Other things that you can do is get one or two utilities bills changed into your name, and then you're building up a rating there - but remember that this will not give you instant credit; it will take a while.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	put yourself on the electoral register.|`|aJxAb1OCaa	get a co-signer, or put down a deposit.

4RjM5lElaa	Well, if your boss finds out you expressed interest he could fire you - it would be disguised as something along the lines of poor performance but the reality would be that he felt threatened by you.    Do not utter your interest in the job directly.  Be a little subtle about it.  How?  Connect with someone higher than your boss and ask if you could take him/her to a business lunch - and the subject is career pathing.  If you know of nobody in such a position, contact your HR rep and see if they can connect you with someone.    Now, oftentimes people will not be willing to meet with you but you will score an occasional meeting if you are persistent.  Also, buying them lunch is a nice enticement.    When you do get a meeting, be prepared.  Hopefully the person who agrees to meet you has a good history with the company.  Ask about their career pathing.  Point out something that they have done in the past that you felt was solid...be honest about it, come across as a brown noser and you are toast.  Then ask if they can offer advice to help you navigate the company waters - and tell them that you would love to move up one day, etc.  Do not mention your boss' job directly, you are merely looking for steps to take to get to that next level.  If the meeting goes well, ask if they would consider mentoring you.  If the connection is solid and they are in good standing with your company, they will help you get noticed.    Hope that helps|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	don;t say anything to anyone before the boss is gone - you could sabotage yourself -     "make sure my company knows that I'm interested in taking the position..."     higher ups may have no idea what you are talking about if you bring that up and YOU could be viewed as a bad guy trying to get rid of someone
Qqz0H2hEaa	I have seen it a real benefit for a lot of people- but it needs to be understood. Most people take the loan as a lump sum, live there rent free the rest of their life and when they die or move into a retirement home the mortgage company takes the house.  There is no recourse against your other assets if the house will not sell for the full amount owed later.    If you think of it as selling your house with a life estate then you will be ok.  If you think of it as a loan that someday you will pay off then you might be disappointed.|`|AA11173563	the first question is do you need the cash?

qsLhVZd8aa	Since my husband and I bought our first home in August 2008 I have to agree with you 100%!  I didn't hear about the $15,000 not having to be repaid, but that absolutely disgusts me!  Also the fact that ANYONE will qualify for it, not just first time home buyers.  Sure, people will start buying up houses to get that credit, things will go good for awhile, but the bubble will burst again sooner or later.|`|AA11173563	First of all the $7,500 is an interest free loan that is repaid over the next 15 years out of your refund since you will have mortgage interest to deduct. Now were you happy with your purchase? if so quit your B-----G. You may be able to streamline the rate on your home if it is a government loan FHA or VA. If you like this home pay your note. If you think you can do better then sell it and buy another home but ranting about what may happen does you no good at all. The $15,000 is not even in law and may never make it.   Good luck to you|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	your house was bought within the allowable time frame (after April 9, 2008) - YOU ARE ELIGIBLE    you do have to pay that $7500 back over 15 yrs - reducing your refunds by $500 a year|`|2N6oTOLQaa	2008 tax laws are final. Any changes they make can only affect 2009 taxes, so there's no purpose in waiting.     IF they make changes to the credit for 2009, its because they are digging deeper and taking more drastic measures to help the economy.     As far as it being unfair: life is unfair. Either get over it or invest in the Kleenex Corporation. You think its unfair that some people got a better deal than you? I bought my house in 2007, I didn't get any tax perks and now with the depreciation I've lost at least $20,000 and I would have to write my bank a check if I wanted to sell it. Quit whining.|`|f4kyqIILaa	So many people are complaining about this tax credit and acting so ungrateful. You're upset because you might have to pay your $7500 back while people who bought their homes in 2009 may not (may being the operative word).  What about those people who bought homes in 2007 and get squat?  Or better yet those who purchased homes before April of 2008?  How fair is it for them?  This is a program to nudge the housing market back into action right now.  It's not that the government wants to just give money to everyone who has ever and will ever buy a home.  I think you just have to plan well and take what you can get and be happy for it rather than upset that someone else got more.|`|FCGWARkQaa	When I read the title to your question I thought the answer would be: "No way - stop whining!  Life's not fair and you were aware of what the circumstances were when you bought."  However after reading the rest of your question I really do see how this seems unfair. You're right you did buy at a volatile time and buying things (LOCAL things) is one thing the economy definitely needs even though it can be a risk.  Maybe you're buying at that volatile time could mean you need the credit even moreso.  I'm sorry for your frustration, but glad you have a home and hope its one you will enjoy for years to come.|`|UPgPxXJjaa	I agree it's unfair.  We bought our home in October 2008.  However, they are considering revising it so that we don't have to pay back the $7500 either.  So it will benefit us if it passes.  Of course, we can't get double amount (the 15k) which we could ALL really use.    I think this is unfair on many levels.  This tax break only gives money to those who can afford to buy a home right now.  Many of the homes on the market are foreclosures or homes that people are being FORCED to sell do to job losses, etc.  This DOES NOT HELP CURRENT HOMEOWNERS ON ANY LEVEL.    What we really need is a stimulus bill that will help keep people in their homes.  How does this help the economy if people go out and buy homes only to be forced into foreclosure or early selling a few years down the road?    Some of the changes that would help us are lower interest rates and if they changed the loans from 30 year to 40 years for those that need it the most.   It would also help if we could refinance at a lower rate - say 1.5%?  Come on people, we CAN do better!!!
AA12198724	you could apply for cash assistance but it may be harder since you have an income. Also if you dont have it but I think you do have you considered section 8? And if you dont have health insurance then I think you can just apply for the entire public assistance package. Also if you really really really need money you can do what I did since I am kind of in the same boat. I started participating in research studies since they pay you in cash and its off the books unless you make 600 dollars in one study alone. Most of them dont even require medication. just check out the volunteer section on newyork.craigslist.org    I actually was approved for public assistance and I live with my dad but with an order of protection I only get like 176 a month on groceries. That should be more than enough you just have to learn how to spend it. Also what I did was I went to the job center at my school and they helped me get a better job and have time to take fifteen credits a semester. If your doing fafsa each semester and you live alone AND you have public assistance then you should not even be paying for school unless its private.  Also dump your phone bill and get a better cell phone plan.  You can do pay as you go monthly plans from AT&T so that when you cant afford it you can scale back and just switch back and forth between pay as you go and pick your plan. Trust me its much better and you dont have to worry about telemarketers or unwanted phone calls plus you will get all your phone calls.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Perhaps you need to work more and scale back your schooling.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	I'm surprised you get food stamps being a student    spend less on food|`|1NO10YfPaa	This depends upon the state in which you live; but, got to tell you, being young and not having a bunch of kids, there won't be much unless you have some sort of disability.

If you were awarded that right, then you should be okay, but use your return to pay back your support, so she can't take you to court to get it.

qgr6Q4qbaa	I think the rules changed recently (within the last couple of years) about small private pensions.  Some providers used to automatically use a tax code which gives the personal allowance - but this can sometimes mean people didn't pay enough tax because they had their personal allowance already set against another source of income.    Contact your HM Revenue & Customs office with details of all of his income (ie private pension, state pension, any earned income, interest on savings accept ISAs, and any other taxable income he receives).  You can phone them for advise or put it in a letter.  Ask them to check his tax codes are correct.    If the private pension shouldn't have tax deducted at 20% (tax code BR meaning basic rate), HMRC will tell the pension provider what tax code they should use.    If you wanted, you could also ask the tax office to check that your husband has paid the correct amount of tax for previous tax years.  If he paid too much, they will send him a cheque.  If he didn't pay enough they MIGHT collect extra tax from him in the future to make up for it - this article might be helpful though because it seems to suggest that if the pension provider made a mistake, they will liable to pay the underpayment of tax...http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/158...    Hope this helps.    Edit:  As the link is helpful, it might be worth sending a printed copy with your letter to the tax office, so they don't just try to collect a tax underpayment direct from your husband without considering collected it from the pension provider first.  (Normally, if the underpayment is 'recent' they nearly always have to collect it from the individual.)|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	Contact HMRC with details of both your incomes. If your getting more than your personal allowance then you have to pay tax.

You will have to mail in the 1040X (with any extra tax due) and as long as you do it prior to 4/15, there will be no penalties or interest charged against you for your haste.|`|DC4Civrvaa	Don't spend the money yet and file an amended return.  That way if you have to give some of it back you will still have it available.  Good luck!

AA11132354	Sure, it's a cashier's check they produced--with photo id.  Also Walmart will cash for $3 if it's under $2999.  And your own bank will cash it for free or deposit it without a Hold because it is cashier's check.  Better yet, use it to open an account, some are giving you a $25 or $50 giftcard for opening an account.|`|1DOtZOtRaa	I do not know if they will but I know Walmart does.
AA12255861	Yes, most of them these day are immediate or next day.  depends on YOUR bank how fast they process the payments.  But most banks copy the check electronically, send it immediately and the paper check is destroyed at the bank.  this cuts down on what we used to call FLOAT time, as it is nearly impossible to float a check anymore.  Year ago, before electronic banking it could take 3-5 work days for a check to come in so it allowed you to write out checks the night before payday or some cases a couple nights before, that is no longer the case. some stores even swipe the check like a debit and give  YOU the check back.  In this case it is the same as a debit.|`|ab1ee2fc3ce86c9f2f98d7bab32a0ffbaa	usually if they give you the check back the money is taken out at that time. if they take the check they usually will cash it in a day or two. debit/credit cards are processed immediately.|`|G9hY2LvIaa	It depends on the merchant but many are doing automatic deductions these days...this means they hit your account the day you purchase.|`|1kZenfZzaa	Yes, you need to have money in your account when you write the check.  Is that why you want to know?
01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	it will not be allowed, she will get a check in a few weeks|`|AA11284831	Yeah, it's a problem.  Your bank will almost certainly reject the deposit when it arrives since her name is not on the account.  Her refund will then be processed for payment by check in 3 to 5 weeks.    Your bank may allow deposits in your husband's name to go through but either you have listed your husband on the account as an authorized depositor OR the deposits are being pushed back in once they hit the item reject queue at the bank.  Mismatched items go into a reject queue and are manually reviewed by the bank.  The person evaluating it can either send it back to the origin or allow it to go through.  If the names are close they may allow it to go through but if they don't match they are SUPPOSED to reject it and send it back.  Banking regulators are clamping down on how these are handled and are burning banks whose item reject practices are too liberal.    A more pressing issue on YOUR end is that now someone else has the keys to YOUR bank account.  She might be a friend today but if you ever have a falling out over anything she has everything that she needs to drain your account from half way around the globe.|`|Cs8wsgvUaa	On second thought I am editing my answer.    I have heard the IRS checks the name to the bank account.  I have no idea if this is true or not. If it bounces back to the IRS they will automatically mail her a check to the address on the tax return

Until then, you can get accidental death insurance which covers almost any accident (falling off a ladder, auto accident, getting killed ) which is the  5 leading cause of death.

You can file as HoH if your dependent child lives in your home with you and you can claim the child as your dependent.  You can also file as HoH if you are supporting a dependent parent who does not have to live in your home.  But your fiance does NOT qualify you for HoH filing status!

5Gxll9Hkaa	Yes, you will need to list these on your bankruptcy (you are required to list ALL debts).  You will probably owe deficiencies on these two items (the difference between what you owe and how much the repossessing entity could sell it for).  Those deficiencies will be discharged in bankruptcy.    If your question is whether you could now get your house and your car back by filing bankruptcy, the answer to that question is, unfortunately, no.

TasV2KaRaa	so sorry to hear about your bad experience today, but i don't think it was discriminatory. i think you should always dress as professional as you can to a job interview even if that means buying one pair of nice slacks and wearing them to every single interview. jeans ARE NOT professional. and also, to show interest in the company you wish to work for most employers expect you to do some research on their company and that includes company policy. which in this case would've ben helpful for you. as long as she didn't say it out loud for everyone to hear then she was just doing HER job. hope this helps and i truly hope you find a job soon! best of luck!|`|iXGC0g8saa	Many peeps get stuck when they are trying to decide what to wear at an interview. Myself I'm from the old school, I contend that formal wear is never wrong; on the other hand, it doesn't really matter what you wear if you make all of your cash from Google like me. Check out the website below to learn how.|`|zVNun27naa	You should always overdress for an interview.  People will take you more seriously if you look professional.  You might not want to get a full on suit, but definitely buy a nice pair of dress slacks and button down shirts.  And make sure your shoes look nice.|`|7cxA70O0aa	...you probably wouldn't have fit in there anyway if that's the environment at that job...dont give up...but it might not hurt to dress up a little more for the next interview...|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	I have never hear of anyone wearing jeans to an interview. I wouldn;t have hired you either.  If you are interviewing for office type jobs, you will not be allowed to wear jeans to work, so until you are hired and know the dress code, you pretty much need to wear a suit and tie to all interviews.  That's life.|`|AA11424005	If you are man and do not wear a suit, white shirt and conservative neck tie to a job interview, you are an idiot.|`|dYYD4ibGaa	You got what you deserved.  You should dress to impress.  Jeans are great for a date - but not a job interview.  Quit spending money on jeans and buy a nice pair of dress pants, white shirt and a tie.  Knock them out...don't give them reason to doubt you.  If you dress to the most important meeting you will have like that - how will you come to work, in shorts and a tee shirt?   I actually got the same thing but it was because I was not wearing a suit...the sport coat and tie was not enough.  From that moment on - suit and tie - and like it or not that is the way it is.  You can buy a suit for 99$ at TJ Maxx  - spend the money if you want the job.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	I've never been turned away for wearing jeans but then I've never worn them to an interview.  Business casual as a minimum.  Depending on the position you're applying for a jacket and tie might be a good idea and it will never get you rejected in the waiting room.|`|aHmAZeoqaa	What's the way the real world works.  Learn from this experience.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Noooo, this has never happened to me because I always dressed appropriate for interviews. Sorry!|`|UaHZH9ifaa	yes wearing jeans is pretty much the worst thing you can do for an interview...you need to go in trousers, shirt, tie, etc
6YVckVa2aa	your friend had better make a phone call to irs number listed on his offset statement. He will owe the money. Sounds like he recieved his refund in error. If he doesnt give it back right away, he will owe late fees, interest and penalties.  I sure wouldnt mess around with that.|`|5EDNrOi3aa	No, he will still end up having to pay the offset. It just he received his refund before the offset was reported. They will most likely take it next year, if he doesn't pay off the offset.
xJi3ixgGaa	When did you buy your house?  The $15000 will only be for people buying a primary residence on or after the bill is actually signed.  Here is some additional information.    I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	No.    First of all, it is just a proposal.    Secondly, you would have to buy a house after 1/1/09 to qualify for it.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	It's a proposal subject to change.  Nothing has been signed into law yet.|`|HEzWkWS7aa	That is just a provision. I do not thinK they have voted on the Economic Recovery Bill that has come out of the house. If it does pass then yes you will be able to claim it as a credit on you return this year or next. I do not know?? It reduces the amount of your taxable income so you are right on that  This would be good for me too, I hope that passes since I could only claim 7500 this year I will be able ot amend my return to get back the full 15,000.  I hope this helps.|`|c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	Actually the $7500 is a credit that you receive, not a reduction of your taxable income. Filing this credit will delay your refund but $7500 is low interest loan from the federal government as of today. Things may change with a new stimulus package
i9EiwV34aa	How would you be able to file as unemployed? You are employed. The ONLY way you might be able to file as unemployed while working is if your hours dip below 16 a week AND you are earning less than 60.50 a week, which is what you would get from Jobseeker's Allowance, and even then you would only get a small amount to bump up your weekly money to 60.50.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if you WERE working 40 hrs a week, you might qualify for partial unemployment - try and see - every state is different    you might need paystubs for quite a few weeks going backwards showing the change in hours
0u6qy9Uuaa	The company will be fined $50 for each w-2 they did not mail by 2/2 - tell them that and if you do not receive by 2/15, write to the IRS and rat out teh company|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The IRS won't take missing W-2 complaints until Feb 15th so you'll just have to sit tight until then.    Although there are penalties for getting them out late, the IRS rarely pursues that as long as they get them out by March 1st.  Even then they rarely penalize the employer if the problem is limited to a few W-2s or unless there appears to be a flagrant or deliberate disregard of the rules.    The mailing deadline this year was Feb 2nd so it could still be on time once mail time is taken into consideration.  And are you sure that they have your current mailing address?  Out-of-date address information is the primary cause for non-delivery of W-2s and that is the employee's responsibility, not the employer's.|`|4GUDR4ONaa	From what I understand and have been told the IRS can audit said company and/or fine them for failing to provide an employee tax information.    Now whether that is true or not I honestly don't know, however I thought I would throw in the popular conception I have been told.|`|HcbS8Nymaa	Companies are required to send out your W2 forms by Jan 31st, I believe.  There's a number listed on here for you to call if you don't get your W2 forms and report it to the IRS:  http://www.filife.com/answers/how-do-you...|`|Lvzjb5rkaa	It is my understanding a W2 must be postmarked no later than Jan 31.  Try to find out if your address on your paychecks at that time (if you can) match your current address, b/c that is the address they will use to mail the W2.  If it got lost in the mail, you may also request a duplicate (but they are not answering the phone)!  Many front desk receptions have caller ID, try pressing *69 before dialing the number, maybe they'll answer.  By all means if none of the above work, REPORT THEM!!!

5gG2OfHIaa	The first step:   Deposit the money you have saved with a broker.  I would and do use a discount broker such as Scottrade, Schwab, or one of the other discount brokers.  Just pick one that is geographically convenient.  I would try to select stocks that are showing growth.   Right now these online educational stocks, and commercial airlines are performing nicely.  Your name, LUV, is the stock symbol for Southwestern Airlines which is a good company but I am not sure it is a good stock.  One tip:  if you buy a stock and doing some research and the stock drops dramatically on bad news, it is usually time to sell.  Please do not let your ego get between you and your money.  Remember, all stock market participants have losing stocks.  It is a flawed approach, I feel, to hold a stock until "it gets back to where I bought it."    Intelligent people think that way; but, it is a highly questionable way to think about stocks.  The market offers you a lifetime learning experience and hopefully some nice returns along the way.  Good luck.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	It's 4AM in Australia and I'm exhausted.    Okay then, (I assume you're from USA)    1. FIND A BROKER  First you need a broker.  You open an account with a broker that you store money and shares in (when you buy them).  It's sort of like a bank account.    When you buy or sell shares you pay the broker commission/brokerage to execute the trade.    I recommend scottrade as a broker because of their low brokerage fees.  http://www.scottrade.com/     2. INDEX SELECTION  If you want to do well in the long run, ALWAYS stick with stocks in  either the S&P 500 index or the NASDAQ 100.  Stocks outside these indexes relate to companies that are more likely to go bankrupt.  If a company goes bankrupt, its shares become worthless.    To find out the stocks in the S&P 500  go to http://www2.standardandpoors.com  - click; United States  - click: Indicies  - click: Equities Indicies  - click: United States  - click S&P 500  - click overview  - click consitute list  Now you've got in front of you a list of the top 500 stocks in the USA  - click Download table to make a copy to Excel    NASDAQ 100  You'll see straight away on the Nasdaq 100 chart that the crash in 2008 has happened and the damage is already done.  After the 1987 stock market crash, the market trended upward up until 2000-01.      http://www.nasdaq.com/dynamic/nasdaq100_...    Scroll down and you'll see a list of the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 list.    If someone or some news report recommends a stock that's not on either of those lists, don't buy it or you're taking a much higher risk.    If you're looking for something to invest in in the meantime while you're learning, I recommend IBM and Google shares.    3. EDUCATION  Avoid stock trading courses.  They're a rip off.  Instead learn from books.  http://www.amazon.com is a great place to search for these.    4. CHARTS  You need charts to see what your stock(s) are doing.  A free charting program is available from Google: http://www.marketbrowser.com/mbzzzvj.asp  I recommend starting with daily and weekly time frames for your charts.  Use a 20 daily or weekly moving average to filter out the volitility    A program that I recommend is Meta Stock: http://www.equis.com    Not all stocks pay quarterly dividends.  For example IBM pays dividends, Google doesn't.  These stocks are going up, so you'll probably make money on either.  Never buy a non-dividend stock going down.    You can do a Yahoo/Google search to find out if a stock pays quarterly dividends and what the annual yield is.      Finally, don't give up your day job even if you make a lot of money.  It may be many years before the market falls like it did in 2008, but a job (at least weekend or part time) is good insurance.    I can honestly tell you from experience full-time trading is stressful.  It's much wiser to create multiple income streams.    (Copy this and save to a Word document)|`|nz5p4NU2aa	Hi there, you need to open a brokerage account and deposit funds into it, TradeKing and Etrade recommended, and make sure you educate yourself so you know what you are doing.

Good luck.|`|a0b943926ff31dc5ae164f5e71cd6efaaa	i read this many many years ago and its a good place to start.    http://www.fool.com/investing.htm?source...    scroll to the middle of the screen where it says in the blue box 'investing education'. read all those, pay particular attention to their 13 steps.  its not an 'end all, be all' on investing, but it will give you more than the fundamentals. after you do it for a while you will see how some of the things they say are not completely accurate for a seasoned investor, but are totally reasonable for a newbie.    some advice;   1.) its investing, NOT gambling.   2.) dont put any of your money at risk until you feel comfortable doing so.  3.) dont take any 'hot stock tips' from strangers on the internet or elsewhere.   4.) learn from your mistakes. i make money, i lose money...i ALWAYS learn something new when i do either of them and constantly try to improve.  5.) and never...EVER....put all your eggs in one basket. diversify.
SEwqwjPkaa	If I were you, I'd stop banging my head and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. Choose the option for individual tax support and choose the options to get you to a live agent. Simply ask them what the delay is and they'll probably tell you. If they can give you an error code, you could cross reference that with the code listing below and that may even provide an answer for you. Either way, don't worry about it and call 'em up. No need to stress more than you have already. So sorry for your loss as well. I can't possibly imagine having to deal with something like that and still carry on my life as usual.

Tyq8OYm1aa	Only if it's written in crayon using block letters.  Otherwise, it would be beyond the reading capabilities of California state legislators.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	LOL . . . you can certainly try.  Unfortunately, we don't have the same power as State governments.  If they don't pay us, there's nothing we can do.  If we don't pay them, they can charge interest on the unpaid amount, they can charge fines, they can put us in jail!  So, although it sounds like a great idea, activist, rebellious . . . I wouldn't do it, if I were you!|`|a5b6eaf1e6e065c5886203f517c6f330aa	lolz...sorry but ur question just made me laugh.hey why not right? why is it that they have the right to do that with us and if we do that towards them they ruin our lives..lolz|`|DC4Civrvaa	Unfortunately that's the whole reason why they are issuing "IOUs".  They don't have any money.  So they need your money even more now than ever before.  That's what we get for hiring an actor to be our governor!|`|uu6JYenAaa	Sure you can, and they will send a sheriff to collect on that IOU|`|AA11132354	Send them HALF what you owe and set up a payment plan.

GutYNu9baa	What country will you be working in?|`|4OKE5zAlaa	The wage is $2.63 an hour, and we get checks once a week, but that is nothing compared to what we get in tips.    Here's how we do in tips where I work:    Weekends:  Morning shift: (either 9am-3pm or 10am-4pm) $100+  Night shift: (9pm to 4am) $130+ We get a crazy bar rush around 2am.  Dinner shift: $50+ (4 or 5pm to 9pm)    Weekdays are slower. The night shift usually will get around $100. Mornings, around $75+. Dinners are not that different on weekends/weekdays, maybe expect a $10 decrease.    On night shifts, one person closes the shift and stays until 7am. That person will make around 170. On morning shifts, one person opens the shift and starts at 7am. That person will make an extra $20 or so as well.    Business is slow around January-March so tips are a little less than what I mentioned. Summer is the best.    Where I work, we're open 24 hours.|`|UArqcGQJaa	I have waited tables for 12 years all over the country.  Weekends at a good restaurant should bring in 100.00 a night, give or take.  If you work during the week...(lunch or dinner)...the key is to open or close the shift, and after everyone else gets "cut" you can make a good bit of money, even on slow days.  Weekends are where it's at unless you are at a good location with some well off business people coming for a quick bite for lunch.  Bubba Gumps FL was great, Claim Jumper CA, Mangos FL.  Good luck.  If you have a good personality, and memory you can do really well.      Usually you will not see a paycheck.  It all goes to taxes, and you have to find out if you have to tip out the bartender, bar back, host, bussers etc.  This can take quite a bit out of your pocket.  Good luck!

You can also call the IRS to check on the status of your refund at 1-800-829-1040|`|wz9szz3Gaa	No they don't send them out at the same time give them a week or two.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	As long as they're not over 17, their birthday doesn't come into play for any tax purposes.    Federal returns are taking longer to process because of all the screwups with the stimulus payments.
GNmqM4OMaa	No, not in this kind of economic crisis. If you don't have the money for it without a bank loan, you should most likely save your money for things that are neccessary in life... like food.|`|VPycXVIlaa	No, in this economy you should only buy the things you can pay for outright. Taking out a loan for furniture at this time is not a good idea at all. Neither is putting it on credit card. Save as much money as you can until you can afford to pay for the furniture in cash.|`|AA10491661	save up pay cash. no payments. and no debt|`|G9hY2LvIaa	Do you own furniture or wears now? If so, is there anything wrong with them? If no, then be content with what you have.  If you want furniture or clothes, try saving up and paying cash.  If you already have these things (and they are in good condition) then wait and pay cash. Don't go to a bank and pay their interest charges.  New furniture may be a WANT, but not a NEED.  Good Luck!|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Why put your self into debt for wants?  It is better and less costly if you save up the money first and pay cash or if they offer 0% financing and you can pay off the loan before the interest kicks in.
ElcwxEajaa	I think I have the answer to why peoples taxes have been being delayed,  our returns are going to pay Obamas cabinet selections back taxes. Hail to the Chief|`|z2Yk76RAaa	I talked to the IRS 5 times and finally got a supervisor. Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted processing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?    Thanks for asking this question by the way, I was thinking of asking myself as the supervisor told me it could be anytime now since it is back in the rotation.    John, I was also told there was a glitch in the system, but it had nothing to do with mine, mine was due to the stimulus amount listed on my return.|`|fqj2oQHtaa	my direct deposit was set for the 10th of feb also...but today "wheres my refund" now says feb 17th....my direct deposit date has been pushed back 3 times now. I efiled using turbo tax on jan 26..irs excepted on jan 27 w/ a direct deposit date of feb 3rd..then pushed to feb 10th...now pushed to feb 17th. I called irs this A.M , they told me there were no errors or anything wrong with my return, they explained there were some "glitches" on there wheres my refund web site, thet glitches were causing invalid direct deposit dates. They told me the system has been fixed and the new dates given will be around the time i get my deposit. they told me stimulas mistakes on returns are NOT THE CAUSE OF THE DELAYS ALL...it is simply a system glitch. they explained the mistakes on the stimulas payments that alot of people are making are fixed almost instantly when they are processing your return and are not causing any delays like ALOT of people are saying is the cause...IT IS NOT! Confirmaed today with IRS !   And you can "trust" them...they know what there talking about!!...LOL ...I think if you spoke to someone at irs 20 times....they would give you 20 different answers to your question....you wouldnt hear the same thing twice!!!!!!!|`|G3P5htn7aa	Changed from 2/3 to 2/24 and still sitting at 2/24 as of this morning.  I'm sure keeping my fingers crossed though that it comes much earlier.  I'm on hold now with the IRS so we'll see what they have to say.|`|pF1oLaInaa	my brother is having the same issue- it has been puched back 3 times now all the way until the 24th. mine was pushed back once.     btw-mine was pushed back from the 30th to tomorrow due to me not adding the stimulas.    go figue!!
lgSF2TH7aa	1201 means you owe other taxes or child support they are off setting your refund.|`|l0rKjtUDaa	Check the WMR again today and see if that code changed. Mine did the same thing, but it changed and now my refund has been sent to Republic Bank (finally!)  Just waiting on them to DD to my account. Good luck.
tmXgAXm1aa	I did. I filed through tax brain and did the ral with sbbt but was denied. I was told it was now a rt. The irs site says deposit will go out on 2/6 and the sbbt site says they have recieved all or part of my return...blah blah blah.... and it will be sent to my bank. I used my pre-paid netspend card for that so I am hoping I will see the money soon. Someone said deposits actually are sent wed by the irs so we can have it friday but I don't know. I am waiting like everyone else....|`|aBRDy1q4aa	I have sbbt, my refund is to be deposited tomorrow.  sbbt rep says they have not recieved notice form irs yet (as of 1 hour ago).  my account on their websiute has not changed yet, I am hoping it will be in MY bank tomorrow so I can get my bills paid|`|yKZqJsgSaa	i called jackson hewitt the one who gave me the cash card ...and they go through sbbt...and they stated that the money will go their sometime today...hope soon cuz im off to cancun this weekend...|`|I5tcvNC1aa	I use them and it takes about a day for them to forward to my bank account.

You should have it by Tuesday at the latest, but there is the definite possibility that you'll have it sooner.
AA11284831	Not only that but it would be the final death knell for the auto and housing industries.  Imagine having to pay an additional $6,000 in TAX just to get the tags on your new $20,000 car.  Or how about the $60,000 TAX on a new home!  And since the tax doesn't increase the actual value of the items, lenders will NOT be lending you the tax so you'll have to bring that to the table at closing in cash.    The proponents of the "Fair Tax" seem to think that the savings in corporate taxes will trigger lower prices that will offset the cost on the consumer end.  But their assumptions are defective on many levels.      First off, it ignores the fact that 60% of US corporations pay NO Federal income taxes at all.  The US automakers are bleeding cash at an alarming rate and pay no income taxes presently so where are their price reductions going to come from??    Then they ignore the fact that corporate income taxes are a small fraction of the total income tax take.  Therefore even if corporate income taxes were abolished entirely there is nowhere near the assumed savings to result in meaningful across-the-board price cuts.    Then they assume that corporate tax cuts, where they do exist, will result in actual price cuts.  If Ford and GM are not cutting prices, do you honestly think that Honda and Toyota will cut theirs by much?  Hell no!  The savings will be distributed to shareholders, not given away to customers!    They also ignore the massive black marketing that the "Fair Tax" would trigger as consumers at all levels scrambled to side-step the overnight 30% increase in the cost of all goods and services.      Then they ignore the fact that it would be a major tax break for the wealthy who tend to amass wealth, not spend it all.  And when you give one group a break another group MUST pick up the slack.  That puts the burden square on the shoulders of the poor and middle class.    There's a good reason that the "Fair Tax" -- or variations of it -- have languished in committee for a decade:  It's a TERRIBLE idea that has NO chance of EVER becoming law.  It would relegate the US economy to third-world status.|`|NZuJR79oaa	No, in fact the fair tax would make the United States the tax haven of the world.  Hundreds of large companies and thousands of small to medium sized companies would move here from other countries.      Since the businesses would not have an income tax of 30 - 50% on income, the root price of items would decrease from current prices, then with the added on sales tax it would increase to around what prices are now., It just takes the tax out of a hidden arena and makes it obvious that this dollar amount is tax, THEN people will be more likely to fight against tax increases and fight for tax decreases. Govt will have to tighten up, and the projected 23% sales tax will eventually drop.     Of course two constitutional amendments would have to be passed for  this to work.  One abolishing the income tax and one giving congress the power to levy a sales tax.
Pjm9pg7iaa	They do this because they don't know what else to do. The Economics textbooks say that lowering the bank rate will "stimulate" borrowing and spending. Which will lead to more jobs and more income. So far it isn't working. But it might..|`|AA10259042	You have better sense than the government.  Dropping the rates is the only thing the idiots can think of to do.  Of course what they want people to do is to spend their money, not save it. Not only spend it, but borrow more and spend that too.  If it were not for stupid governments we would not have any governments.|`|4v270A8saa	Your actual question is lost in your rant and it appears you are mixing different sources of interest rates.    The discount rate that the fed sets for banks to borrow from their local Federal Reserve is currently waivering between 0-.25%.  The rates you get for your savings and CD's is still set by your local bank and represents how much they are willing to pay you for money that they will then lend out to others.  Since banks are hoarding cash and not making loans they don't need more money from individuals thus capitalism forces the rates down (supply & demand).    The feds lowering the discount rate is the only way they can say "hey banks we've got your back go ahead and make loans (and borrow via savings accounts & cds from individuals) and if something happens we'll loan you emergency funds at 0%.  The banks are saying "screw you feds, we're not loaning any money to anyone and by the way we need zero percent loans as a bailout too from the government".    The notes the Treasury sells to generate cash for it's uses do have lower rates but again that's not to benefit anyone those reflect what people are willing to pay for secure investments.  Savers like yourself are leaving banks and buying notes from the US Government (for safety) and thus you're driving down the interest rates yourself...again capitalism (supply & demand) at work.    Fluctuations in savings & cds are a selffullfilling prophecy.  You fear you're not making enough money or fear that your bank may collapse so you pull your money out and invest in Treasury Notes.  You purchasing T Notes drives down the price (the same price a bank would pay to invest in T Notes).  So a bank says "hey i'll by investments on the open market and save money, since everyone else is doing the same thing (capitalism) and driving the rates down.    Don't blame policy makers for the bad results of capitalism.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	So, the problem is that the airline have said that you didn't lodge a complaint, right?  Well, can you not just provide the insurance company with all the proof that you have that you did lodge one?  Normally, they give you a document with a reference number on it whilst you are stood at the desk initially reporting your baggage missing.  Plus, you must have copies of correspondence that you have sent to them since then.    You say that now the insurance company want a letter from the airline saying that they will not pay out.  Can you not come to some agreement with them where you will make however many attempts to contact them - either by mail or email so that you can prove that you have tried - and if you receive no response, it can be assumed that they are not considering your claim and will not be paying out?|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	I know nothing about travel insurance.  Sorry.    I would suggest you contact the Department of Insuance in your state for help.    A link is below for it.
C0tYtelFaa	Sounds like you are in a precarious situation..  Let's walk through a few things..    1) I would not talk to the collection agency anymore period.  You already have a period of 3 years without a payment.  Depending on your state, the debt may expire NOW or over the next few years.      2) The collection agency or original creditor may choose to file suit against you for collection of the debt.  In most cases, the collection agency is the one who makes this choice since most companies will rather pay someone else to do it.  If the collection agency files suit against you, you will be served with a "complaint".  From that complaint, you must issue an answer.  From there, the case is set forth for a hearing in front of a judge.  In your answer (if you are sued), you must contradict all claims to monies they say you owe.  Too many times, companies inflate monies that consumers owe because they will not fight back and challenge them on their figures.. Thus, if you had a legitimate billing dispute, which it sounds like you did, you need to challenge them and explain to the judge the situations at hand.      3) Depending on your state, your wages may or may not be garnished.  However, do not misinterpret this to mean they cannot seize monies in your bank account.  In mostly all jurisdictions, the plaintiff (collection agency) can file a motion to the court called " a writ of execution" against the defendant "you".  This writ of execution allows for different items to be seized.  Since you imply you are "judgment proof", you really do not have much to be concerned.      4) Regarding another contributor's concern about your credit.. Let me the first to alleviate that concern.  In most cases, CASH is KING.  The apartment complex may request a double deposit, etc.. However, if  you are listed as an occupant only, there may be no relevance in your credit score.  This is a gray area, depending on the apartment complex.      Finally, understand that most collection agencies, etc, will choose to file suit very closely after a debt goes delinquent.  You normally do not see companies filing suit against people 3 - 10 years after a debt has went delinquent.  What it sounds like happened is the collection agency was unable to collect from you, so it is referred back to the original creditor.  From there, the original creditor assigns it to a more aggressive collection agency, and so forth until they hope you pay.      Thus, this is the reason for the stoppage of letters.. Do not worry.. First thing I would do though is to look up your state's statute of limitations on collection of debt.  Then just lay low and ignore the collection agency's phone calls and letters.. The only letter to not ignore is the letter stating you will be sued..      Feel free to e-mail if you have further questions..|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	What this company can do depends on a lot of factors.  First they can't garnish your wages until they get a judgment.  This requires them to file suit in civil court.  At which time you have a chance to defend yourself.  If they do get a judgment it depends on your state as some states do not allow wage garnishment.  However, they may also be able to attach your bank account directly.  If they do this they can take up to the amount of the judgment at one time.  So one day you may find you have a lot less in your bank account, because they attached that money.  One thing you have to look at if they do sue you is the Statute of Limitations, you may be beyond the time they could prevail in court if they do sue you.    As to your apartment.  Most apartments require anyone who is going to be living there to be on the lease.  As such they will run a credit check on everyone.  Now, your bf might have good enough credit to counter yours, but you have to be aware that this collection account may cause an issue.|`|qBCGH52haa	Can't answer what will they do since I can't read minds, but if they so desired, they could go to court and get a judgment against you for the balance owed.  Once they have the judgment, they are required to work with you to make payment.  If you then did not make payments as agreed, they can return to court and get a second court order to garnish your wages.|`|ry4DKt0Qaa	If they stopped calling you, they started the paperwork to garnish your wages.  They will get their money and kill your credit score.|`|7e25ab13e48dd8ca1039f649017bf1d0aa	They could file a judgment for garnishment. But I really don't think they would. I worked for a collection agency. We had accounts for over $100K and nothing was done about it. We tried to collect on them just like a $100 account.   If haven't contacted you in 3 years, I really don't think they will. It will still be on your credit report. They probably wrote it off as bad debt. To you it may be a large amount. To the company it's pennies. I'm not guaranteeing this is what happened. But it could be.   Glad you learned your lesson. Credit cards aren't all that bad, if you know how to use them.

The biggest problem is to make sure the house and contents are insured for replacement cost, not depreciated value, and for rebuilding to current codes.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Get the minimum replacement cost policy.  It should cost no more than $50 - $75 per month with a $1K deductible. this will cover rebuilding the house and replacing probably everything you have as long as it is well documented.|`|AA10179458	I don't know the value of your home so it's hard to tell.

Plus inflation factor!|`|pRibsCSXaa	Ignore everything Natasha said, she's pretty much wrong on everything she's said.|`|AA10424307	Your home should be insured for no less than 80 percent of what's considered the "replacement value." For instance when you purchase the house you also purchase the land lot/ground it sits on. Say the land and ground along with the house is purchased for $200,000.  Even if your house burns to the ground, the land is still there, worth (again for example) $40,000. So you can assume to insure the house for no less than $160,000. Because it's RARE that any house will literally be destroyed (burned to the ground, heaven forbid!!); most insurances at 80 percent will cover your basic damages to repair/replace your losses.  Most H.O. policies are written so that the contents ("average stuff in the house") are automatically insured for ten percent of the policy value: A house insured for $160,000 would have automatic coverage on contents of $16,000. Liability is also included at the rate you choose for coverage (i.e., someone falls on your property and incurs medical damage, you can pay more for increased coverage or accept standard policy provision. See "liability" or "medical payments to others.")  Bottom line: You don't have to "choose" contents coverage; it's sort of automatic! Be sure to think about other things such as boats, jewelry, etc. which should be insured separately and premiums are high, if you're lucky enough to own such.
ft8t98Pnaa	try and avoid bankruptcy as much as possible.. you can only do it like once... Let them take your car if you cant afford it.. or try and sell it back to the dealership. see if you can get out of it w/o having a repo on your credit...      There are a few things you should research prior to deciding to file for bankruptcy. The first thing to look at is the many alternatives to filing for bankruptcy. Some long-time homeowners who have substantial equity in their homes choose to take out a low interest-rate home equity loan to consolidate all of their debt. Since the repayment term is typically 10 or more years on a home equity loan, and the interest rates are usually considerably lower than unsecured debt, the monthly payment on a home equity loan could be significantly less than the combined monthly payments on all of your debt prior to consolidation. This is only one alternative to bankruptcy, there are others and all should be researched to see if they would be more beneficial to you than filing for bankruptcy.    Another important thing to research prior to filing for bankruptcy is how the bankruptcy is going to affect your life. Naturally the bankruptcy will have an impact on your credit score but typically the higher your credit rating is going into a bankruptcy, the higher it is at the culmination of the bankruptcy process. Many things in life rely on your credit rating from housing (both home ownership and renting) to insurance (automobile and home/renters insurance use your credit rating to determine insurability and rates). Considering your future, life after bankruptcy, will help you decide if filing for bankruptcy is the best choice given your circumstances.|`|AA10491661	if you owe 20,000 and the car sells for 10,000, you owe the difference and they can sue you for it.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	try to make a payment deal with your car company anyway. theyd rather you pay ti off slow than not get the full value for it when someone else buys it.    thats what my dad did|`|NcFWcO3Laa	A bankrupty would wipe out  the debt but it would be foolish to go to that expense it this time.

g8ZvrrHDaa	I e-filed on Jan. 28th.  WMR never has told me when a refund WOULD be direct deposited.  Only the date I should have it by.  This time WMR told me I should have it by 2/10.  It's showing in my account for DD today, 2/5.    UPDATE:  Even though my bank says it's going in my checking account today, I decided to check WMR to see what it said...it's says "Your tax refund is scheduled to be direct deposited on February 6, 2009. If your refund is not credited to your account by February 11, 2009, check with your bank to find out if it has been received.

AA10368727	Yes.  You are required to report your income to the IRS.  The business owner should have requested your SSN before you even began work.  In order for him to deduct the fees he paid you, he has to issue you a Form 1099, which you'll then use to report your income to the IRS.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes - he's required to file the 1099 and you have to give your SSN. He should have collected it up front as a requirement for being hired.|`|YCjIqvXaaa	Yes u have to show your SS number. Any time that you apply for a job they ask for your SS number.
X6rFPI2laa	Yes, there is a time limit, and I just checked that yesterday with IRS.  The usual forms such as those for employees are due January 30, but some 1099's are not due until February 15 (actually 2/17 this year because the 15th is a Sunday and the 16th is a national holiday).  My question specifically dealt with the 1099-DIV form, so I don't know about the kind you would be getting.  You can call the friendly folks at IRS on 1-800-829-1040 and ask about your particular situation.  It may take a while and a bit of number-punching various options, plus some elevator music, but you will get to talk to a real human being, and the wait is worth it.
d0Yhl2pXaa	I love it when people anwer questions without any information to back them um.  Uh, probally not.... duh.    Ok, there are a lot of misconceptions going around about this. According to Senator Isakson's website, "The amendment would allow taxpayers to claim the credit on their 2008 income tax return." This means that you do not have to wait until 2010 to claim for the 2009 year. Also, it says that "Purchases must be made within one year of the legislations enactment, and the tax credit would not have to be repaid." I interpret "within on year" to mean one year before the date of enactment or one year after the date of enactment. But nothing has been finalized.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	1)  There is no law yet.    2)  Everything that I have read about the new tax items make them effective 1/1/09.    So....no, probably not.
aUQ1ridmaa	There are a whole lot of things that can come into play.    Of course you will need any document that was sent to you stating you earned income from somewhere.     Work would send you a W-2 if you had taxes withheld; if you will be paying the taxes they would send a 1099-MISC. (Working at a store VS selling Tupperware from your home.)    A bank or broker would send you a 1099-INT, 1099-DIV or 1099-B. (If you have investment income, or money in a bank account, such as you have an Individual Retirement Account or a savings account that earns interest.)    If you are going to be claiming any dependents (Anyone who lived with you, and you paid the support for) you would need the information from their social security card - Name, Social security number as well as their date of birth.    If you own a home and are paying a mortgage, then you would be sent a 1098 form, that shows how much of your monthly payment went towards the interest and how much was paid in real estate taxes.    If you went to college last year, then you should have a 1098-T form, that shows how much the school billed to you, how much you paid, and how much you received in scholarships, grants and loans. This can help in multiple ways, depending on your situation.    If you are going to tax professional, then you will need to bring in some forms of identification - they need to make sure you are you! Photo ID such as a state ID or driver's license, and a passport or social security card.    There are a lot more items that you might need to bring, but these are some of the most common. Just like snowflakes, every tax return is different, so you may be asked for more information than what you have in hand.    I hope this helps  Shannon C
IKakoOfyaa	If it's pending, it should post later on today or tomorrow depending on your bank's policies.  Call them to verify.    Almost everyone had their refunds delayed by a week this year because of the recovery rebate.  That had to do with the stimulus checks issued last year.  If you received the full amount due, you were not supposed to claim a credit or put the amount of your stimulus check on your return.  This confused many people and they entered the full amount anyway or an incorrect amount, causing the IRS computers to kick the return out for an error.  After the error was corrected, the returns were reentered into the system.  However, even people who filed correctly and didn't claim a deduction had their returns kicked out as well due to a glitch in the IRS computer system.    In other words, the favor the government granted us last year is coming home to roost this year.|`|ylvYl6fdaa	My bank still isn't showing a pending deposit but last week someone who banks with NFCU said theirs didn't show up until that Friday of the DD and wasn't able to get it until that Saturday.|`|l0rKjtUDaa	i don't think anyone "really" knows what the delay was, but congrats!!!!  finally folks are starting to get their money.

In most cases the mortgagee will not file for foreclosure until you have missed 3 payments.  Foreclosure can take anywhere from 3 months to a year and you can stay in the home until a final judgment is rendered and the property has been sold at a "courthouse sale."    realtor.sailor|`|QT0qTFyAaa	They could that's why you file bankruptcy, to protect yourself from them trying to come after you.

tA8T4QYFaa	The details of the plan haven't been released.    It's 10% of the price of the home, or $15K max. And it would be a credit vs. a loan (like the current $7,500).|`|Daq9gituaa	At present, do not count on any of the proposed provisions of Mr. Obama's 2009 stimulus program. The program is far from being finalized so nothing is set in stone at the moment. If the Home Buyers Credit does become part of the program, it may or may not be retroactive and the terms of the provision can be far different from one is presently hearing discussed. When all the dominoes have fallen into place then we can know what will happen. Until then, patience my friend, patience.|`|xJi3ixgGaa	I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.  Depending on your financial situation the prior tax credit may be better.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.
pt6wIlS1aa	No, not at all. It doesn't mean you're a shoe-in to be hired, just that you're one of the ones they really like. Realize, though, that they may have several other excellent candidates, especially now when so many people apply for every job opening there is.    But often people aren't excellent fits for a job, and those people do not get told that they are. So you can take their words as sincere. Good luck getting the job!

HFKr2vBsaa	The money you make will depend on the area you live in and whether there are a lot of IT jobs available.  I used to work for a recruiting company and it's a lot of 24/7 work for recruiters. You need to be able to talk to people when it's convenient for them so that means nights and often weekends.  Right now, there is a glut of applicants and too few jobs.  IBM is laying off as is a lot of other companies.    Biomedical seems to be the stable place to be, try looking to recruit there.
pt6wIlS1aa	I'd like to know of such a test, too, as I have the same problems with smoke.     IMO, smokers have no business living in a smoke-free apartment building. They shouldn't be smoking outside, either, as that restricts the non-smokers from using the apartment grounds, which is part of what their rent pays for. It means you can't even take out your garbage, can't clean snow off your car, can't sit in the sun or take a walk without being assaulted by smoke.

258c8918b8008933d8507500eed704dcaa	I believe if you receive a certain percentage or above of your income/support from your parents, then you can be claimed as dependent on their tax form.   To make sure what are the specific circumstances which differs in each state, ask your state's tax accountant for details.  good luck|`|0rAgtGNgaa	yes you can be claimed as a dependant if you have lived there for at least 6 months of the year.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	No, you most likely can NOT be claimed as a dependent.    You are too old under the Qualifying Child rule since you are not a full-time student.  (If you were a full-time student for at least any part of 5 months in 2008 AND didn't provide more than half of your OWN support then you would be a dependent under the Qualifying Child rule for 2008.)    If you earned more than $3,500 in 2008 you cannot be claimed under the Qualifying Relative rule regardless of how much support anyone else may have provided.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	I think you have to be going to school for them to claim you as a dependant over the age of 18.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Regardless of how old you are, your parents can claim you on their taxes if they provided 50% or more of supporting you in their household in the previous tax year.  Back years ago I claimed my mother, my daugher and I lived with her at the time.  My mother didn't work much so I was able to claim her at tax time with me checking "head of household" for myself on the tax form.  You have to be head of household and have qualifying dependents to do that.  But if you are going to school you can be claimed on your parents (or whoever claims you) taxes until you are 24.  But you can't claim yourself if someone else claims you.  That's what happened with me and my daughter.  She is now 27.  But I was able to claim her as a dependent while she was still in school until she was 24.  She's been claiming herself since she was 25 and I am only able to claim only myself at tax time. Hope this helps and didn't confuse you too much.|`|eca6e84f8c585231830041fd53f65d6daa	This is a tricky question since you are not going to school and you are younger than 24 years old, so in this case it appears that you don't qualify as a dependent. However, lets say your parents still provide for more than half of their support like shelter, food,  utilities, medical expenses, everyday expenditures, etc, then you will be considered a dependent in this case. So, in this case, you do not qualify as a "qualifying child" but you DO qualify as a "qualifying relative" only if you make less than the exemption amount of 2008. I think this year the exemption amount is around $3500. So in other words, if you made less than $3500 last year, AND your parents provided more than half of their support, you DO qualify as a dependent.    Since you make well over $3500, you do not qualify as a dependent. You file as single, which is good because when you are claimed as a dependent, you will not receive that much of a refund.|`|kRTSVuywaa	yes you can be claimed as a dependent if you are a full time student in college and you are making less than i think it is $3,500 in a year|`|HJcIKFOPaa	Your age and schooling (or lack of school attendance) has nothing to do with this quesiton.    The question is who provides more than 50% of your support. In figuring this you need to take into consideration, housing, transportation, food, utilities. Life necessities. You live at home...do you pay rent? If you are providing for your own entertainment and your parents are buying all the groceries paying the mortgage and the utilities, providing you with car insurance...then yes they can claim you!

Strengths and Weaknesses are internal and Opportunities and Threats are external forces that affect the organization.    My advise is to be specific and address very few points, if I were you I would jot down 5-7 points of each category and highlight and elaborate 1 or 2 points out of em! (remember you have only 2 mins 30 secs to explain each part). this way you can do a good presentation of 10 mins.  pls don't write too much, make it short and simple cos with too much of anything, you'd end up talking nonsense for 10 mins.     Concentrate more on the presentation skills, SWOT will not be that complicated if you give it a bit of effort and time.    Good Luck!|`|oCMrcnu0aa	I am guessing you know what 'SWOT' stands for.  Just in case, it means:  Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.    Find out all you can about the store.  Find out all you can about the market sector in which it operates, the economic trends, product trends, competitor activity ... anything and everything.  Brainstorm anything you can think of about that store in relation to its market.  Critically appraise your thoughts, flesh them out and allocate them to a list as a threat, risk or whatever.    Are there gaps?  Have you told the whole story?  Would that explain the situation to a Martian who just landed?  If not, flesh it out some more and don't be afraid to put some factors in more than one category.  A threat can be an opportunity to change for the better.    Think of people skills, location, reputation, customer base, product range, how resilient this product range is to economic downturns ... anything like that to show you can draw on available information, analyse it in a meaningful way and show creative opportunities (because if it is all bad news, they don't to hear it and you don't want to work there.)    Start your presentation with confidence and end your presentation on a positive note. Good luck.
NrvrH4zQaa	Any earnings from stock (dividends, capital gains) need to be reported regardless of the amount.  Your broker sends Form 1099-DIV and Form 1099-B to the IRS reporting your dividends and stock sales, respectively.  The IRS will match your tax return against the broker's info and if they don't match you'll likely get a friendly letter from the IRS.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Its not that you don't have to "file", you don't have to claim it as income...BIG difference.|`|vRswFr1Raa	idk
RkfIPD7Iaa	Just about any home improvement project between $1000 and $10,000 qualifies.  The tax break amounts to a 15% credit, making the work eligible for between $150 and $1500.  Basically making the goods tax free, is how I look at it.
T6nmD3X9aa	you made money, you have to pay taxes. If you have the statements from school, those are tax deductable and you can also apply for the education credits (for taxes, not school credits).

If the stimulus check is the same as last year as well, as long as you made over $3000 you will get that, but only if you filed a valid tax return.    Depending on your eligibility, since you made so little, you may be able to get an Earned Income Credit as well.|`|AV0eejfLaa	I would u might get a refund with ur low income and u being a student call a tax expert and ask there advice|`|81wShS3taa	Did you have any income taxes withheld?  If you can claim  your own exemption and had taxes withheld you should file to get your money back.  Education credits are non- refundable, therefore, filing for education credits with income less than $8950 will not increase your refund.  These credits reduce tax liability only and with income less than 8950 you will not have a tax liability to reduce.  If you cannot claim yourself you cannot use education credits. Kind of a catch 22.    Lee, Enrolled Agent    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

bFRVSDteaa	The IRS will confiscate your refund only if you have defaulted on your back taxes (or other obligations, like child support or student loans).  The fact that you have entered into an installment arrangement with the IRS to pay your back taxes, and are living up to the terms of that arrangement, means that you are not in default of those back taxes.    Thanks for living up to your tax obligations.  Your reward is that you will not have your refund confiscated.

They're giving out IOUs instead of refunds this year....seriously.|`|Daq9gituaa	There is no set rule as to which is received first. Some states will issue refunds before the federal is received and some may still wait until your federal file has been accepted before issuing a refund.

Regardless of what method the state may use, your tax filing is subject to audit just as the federal is if the figures are not in agreement.|`|2COcJhdtaa	Federal Income|`|kdNfrpcmaa	You may want to check this site out they have a estimated Tax refund calender.

DAMZKbpDaa	If you already filed without the W-2, you will need to do an amended return.     If it was the "tax professional's" fault, in other words, you brought the W-2 in and he or she forgot to include it, I would press him or her to do the amended return at no additional charge. You need to do it before April 15, to avoid penalty and interest, but you need to wait a few weeks to allow the IRS to process your old return.    If you didn't bring it in with you when you're taxes were being prepared, well, the tax professional still may do an amended return for you for goodwill.    Whether he or she does one for you or not, you still are responsible for getting the 1040-X amended return done, and paying what you owe to the IRS.    If you are thinking the tax professional should pay your due taxes, I don't know anyone in the industry (and I know quite a few people) that would do that.

Ive had my own small business as a web developer. When I was searching for a hosting company I did weeks of trying to find reliable and cost effective web hosting services.  After much research I finally went with lunarpages. There were a couple other sites out there that seemed to be good but what made me pick lunarpages was the majority of positive online reviews and the friendly customer service I received when talking to the lunarpages customer reps. For the past 3 years I havent had that many problems because the service has met all my needs. And if I did have problems they would always have a solution for it.      Through my business Ive created my own website along with many client websites using lunarpages. I have no complaints and my customers have no complaints with lunarpages.      Summary of just one of the hosting packages that I think will satisfy your requirements:  Basic Hosting Package: Unlimited email creation, creation of additional domain names are free, unlimited storage space, and unlimited bandwidth per month. And it costs $4.95 per month.    If you want reliable service, good customer support, along with cheap deals, go with lunarpages. For 3 years they havent let me down yet.

IKakoOfyaa	The standard deduction is upped by $1000 for joint filers (500 for single) who paid up to $2500 in real estate or property taxes. If you paid over that amount, you can still claim it as a line item itemized deduction. Topic 503 - Deductible Taxes, IRS website and http://taxes.about.com/od/deductionscred...    To answer your other question, many states collect property taxes based on the assessed value of real estate.|`|Daq9gituaa	Real estate taxes can be included as a deduction. Permitted deductions in all categories must be greater than your permitted standard deduction before they reduce your tax liability. For example, a single person under age is allowed a standard deduction of $5450. If that person owns a home that is mortgaged and has medical expenses, interest, real estate taxes, state taxes etc, and his total deductions are $7500, that reduces his taxable income by $2050.    Exception for people over 65 - seniors paying real estate taxes get a $500 addition to their standard deduction if they are unable to itemize deductions.|`|6sTsIH05aa	The taxes you pay on real estate can benefit you on your income tax return if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040.  You may claim the property taxes you pay and the mortgage interest.
Ib3aYExwaa	This is what is going on. Anyone who return was accepted between 1/16 and 11am on 1/22 was given the date of 2/3 (which is dd on 1/30). If it changed and gave the date of 2/10. YOUR RETURN WAS CORRECTED LAST WEEK BUT NOT IN TIME TO BE DD ON 1/30. MOST OF THESE WERE CAUSED BECAUSE OF THE REBATE LAST YEAR. WHEN IT CALCULATES AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET THE MAX IT ADDED THE BALANCE ON YOUR RETURN. (EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T GET A REBATE LAST YEAR). IRS HAD TO GO IN AND DEDUCT THE EXTRA AMOUNT AND RESUBMITTED IT INTO THE PROCESSING. ANY AND EVERY TIME IRS TOUCHES YOUR RETURN IT WILL CHANGE THE DATE. SO IF YOU GOT THE 2/10 DATE THAT MEANS YOUR RETURN WAS CORRECTED AND IT WILL BE ISSUED 2/6. ONCE THEY PROCESS THE AMOUNT IT (WMR) WILL CHANGE AGAIN. IT IS STILL A LOT OF TIME FOR THEM TO PUT IT THROUGH. NO NEED TO WORRY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE 2/10 DATE IF IT WASN'T ALREADY CORRECTED. OTHERS WHO GOT LATER DATES LIKE 2/17-2/29 THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THE REBATE AMOUNT POSSIBLE EDUCATION CREDITS, ETC. YOU WILL GET YOUR RETURN TOMORROW.

BoAEgaAGaa	You will file a Sch. A, itemized deductions.  If you have itemized deductions that total more than the standard deduction you are allowed for your filing status, then you can deduct the higher itemized deduction instead of the standard deduction.      Other items that are included on the Sch. A are real estate taxes, state and local income taxes or state and local sales tax, certain private mortgage insurance, charitable contributions, medical expenses that exceed 7-1/2% of your adjusted gross income, certain work related expenses that exceed 2% of your AGI, and many more allowable expenses.  Check out the Sch. A instructions on the IRS website.     If you purchased your home after April 8, 2008, and had not owned a home in the last 3 years, you could also qualify for a First Time Homebuyers Credit.  Check out form 5405 on the IRS website.

l0rKjtUDaa	Not sure what happened. all kinds of excuses are floating around, but truth is we will probably never know. I used TaxAct and was supposed to get DD on 1/30 but didn't. I have called the IRS 7 times and got 7 different answers (kept calling after the 3rd time just to see what they would tell me next!).  finally this morning i checked the TaxAct Republic Bank site and they do have my return.  big questions is now when will THEY deposit to my account.  At least I am one step closer! Hopefullly the problems the IRS had are corrected and we will all get our money when they are saying we will now.
tA8T4QYFaa	Did some of your stimulus get withheld to pay something else.
zQtXlxShaa	Hi,    Get rid of all Black Hat seo work you did and re submit after 10-12 months.    Thanks!
2wpD9NFdaa	My was accepted on the 27th and I haven't received anything yet.  I did get a call from them this evening and they left a message for me to call them but when I called it was after 5 so I have to wait until in the morning to find out what they want.  My co-worker filed hers the same day as me and got hers direct deposited on wednesday.  I think NC is the slowest state when it comes to refunds.  I think it took right at 4 weeks for mine last year.  Looks like I will have to wait even longer this year depending on what they called for.  Lets hope it is nothing major.  Good luck everyone.  I am still waiting for my federal refund also.  That has been a nightmare too.    ****UPDATE*****  I spoke with the NC DOR this morning.  Apparently I have a small balance with them of $50 and the lady wanted to argue with me that the balance would not be paid with my refund.  Anyway I got that straightened out by being transferred to someone with a brain.  She said I could expect my refund any day now........I guess that means soon???|`|XVYe1MnYaa	No refund for me either, I filed 1/22!|`|6Dd0DRX8aa	still waiting for mine, good luck, nc LOVES taxes !!!!!|`|mtPZcGs6aa	mine was accepted on 1-29,nothing yet.|`|irHk9X8laa	Mine was accepted on the 28th and i haven't received mine either.
xJi3ixgGaa	I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor.  The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.     It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	There is no final determination about this new credit yet.

I have a question for the H&R Block lady, however. We bought in Oct. of 2008. Should we hold off on filing to see what we get out of this stimulus package? I realize we won't get the 15K, but i heard about $1,000 credit for homeowners who don't itemize? and we also heard we might not have to pay the $7,500 back. that was the original plan from what i heard. Thanks!
8c13b1e1d6401ca48454fd7bf55d38faaa	What taxes are you talking about specifically?|`|AA11622701	All of them....except for the people nominated for cabinet positions by Obama.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Income tax? Approx. 49% of the working population pays income tax. The other 51% don't make enough money to have any federal income tax liability.       Social Security and Medicare Tax?  All workers who properly disclose income, besides some government workers under a different plan pay this tax.     Property Tax? All renters inadvertently pay this tax, as it is an expense to the owner, who covers this expense by increasing rents.  All property owners in counties and states that charge property taxes pay it. (Or the county will take their property)    Sales tax, every time a transaction is made.    Many people pay the death tax, especially small business owners.     Capital Gains tax,  Those who buy and sell assets outside of a protected account (401K, IRA, etc.)    Businesses pay taxes, but since it is an expense you, the end consumer pays the tax in the form of higher prices.|`|sbuNcsIwaa	well their are 300 million people so i would say 250 million do what they should and pay|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Everybody, in one form or another.     Everytime they purchase something, there is usually a sales tax.|`|6Dd0DRX8aa	everybody that buys something pays taxes
8c13b1e1d6401ca48454fd7bf55d38faaa	You only get what you are entitled to, nothing more.  Since millions of people have to PAY each year, some would be lucky to get back $50.    That being said, it really depends on what credits you qualify for, etc.  EIC, Good Hope Credit, Tuition Deduction....of coarse this depends on rather YOU are paying for school or your parents, and if they are claiming you on their taxes or not.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	There are no extra credits for a student being claimed as a dependent by their parents.  If you worked and received W-2s and the total wages in box 1 are less than $5450, then you would only be receiving a refund of the federal income tax you had withheld.  If you earned more than this figure you would not receive all the income tax as a refund.

No other credit is currently available.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	You should take the $7,500 tax free loan now. Assuming the $15,000 credit is passed, then you'll probably get both, but we'll have to wait and see.|`|d0Yhl2pXaa	Ok, there are a lot of misconceptions going around about this.  According to Senator Isakson's website, "The amendment would allow taxpayers to claim the credit on their 2008 income tax return."  This means that you do not have to wait until 2010 to claim for the 2009 year.  Also, it says that "Purchases must be made within one year of the legislations enactment, and the tax credit would not have to be repaid."  I interpret "within on year" to mean one year before the date of enactment or one year after the date of enactment.  But nothing has been finalized.
RkfIPD7Iaa	Every single American, bar none, pays taxes.  Income tax specifically?  Not all, about 1/3 of American adults don't pay any income tax.  But every American (along with those in most other countries) pays some form of tax.  Sales tax, property tax, transfer tax, duties, excise taxes.    Everyone.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Per person its about $3K for this stimulus. $900,000,000,000 / 300,000,000 people.    BUT this money is going to be thrown on to the national debt, since no increase of taxes goes with it.  Try $11,000,000,000,000 / 300,000,000 people.    But the real national debt has to include SS and Medicare promises.  So its closer to $42,000,000,000,000 / 300,000,000 people.
xJi3ixgGaa	It is for any person (not just a new home buyer) who is purchasing a primary residence.  It is not for investment properties.

To qualify, you must not have owned a home in the last 3 years, you must meet the income limitations, and it has to have been purchased in a certain time frame.  It also must be owner occupied; investment property does not qualify.

If you are going to rent you need to look into renting a house, so there is a back yard for the dog.   You may want to look into older neighborhoods, they have larger yards, at least in CA, where I am.

You will most likely have to ammortize the expenses and use them on future tax return as start up costs. The draws are just that. The money that you drew from had already been taxed or it may have been loan proceeds, it is not taxable income.

rFV3UDnTaa	As others have said here, yes, your bank can definitely turn you down for a loan modification. Even with times as bad as they are right now, some banks just  don't see the necessity of working with homeowners who are having financial problems.    I won't get on a soapbox here and start talking about how they caused this problem in the first place, but let's just say that with their culpability in this mess, you'd think they'd be more understanding.    Anyway, others have pointed out that you're going to have a much better chance of success if you have someone who is experienced in this in your corner.    That is most definitely true.    Attorneys can be great at this. For one thing, they know where the bodies are buried in all these bogus loans that many banks issued at the height of the mortgage boom.    If your bank turns you down, or even if they accept your request for a loan modification but don't lower your payments enough, a good attorney will go back, and back, and back again, and negotiate something that truly helps you out, and isn't just a Band-Aid for the time being.    There are two resources that I recommend you take a look at that will explain this in a bit more detail:    http://www.scribd.com/doc/11523856/Loan-...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXR0daP9h...    The first resource here is an article that describes a long modification process, things that can trip you up during it, and how to get around the obstacles that a bank is going to throw up in your path.    The second is a short video that also walks you through the process and shows you how other people have been successful in doing this.    But again, I consider hiring a good attorney who can work this out for you. Bear in mind, I'm not an attorney myself, and I'm not particularly fond of them.    But I do know that when something is this important -- like when failing would mean that you're going to lose your home -- sometimes you have to hold your nose and work with them.    Anyway, please check out the resources I mention above. And good luck to you.|`|AA11820201	You can accept or compare what options you have.  You may even qualify for a government program and get a loan modification through any of the program.    check the government programs and always ask if you qualify for one.  You can read the qualifications and the programs in www.HopeNowMortgages.com|`|e53c9d0a430028886bbc40cad4829d6aaa	yes they can and it seems they are doing it to 99% of the people. the only thing that i know personally has been done for 3 of our friends is they got their interest rate reduced for a period of time. we are trying to get our balance reduced because we've lot 180k in equity - from the legal stuff i've found they are required by law to modify your loan. contact your local congress person - or hire a professional. we might have to do that too.|`|TtVlPxFwaa	They can turn you down, however you are more likely to get turned down if you are handling it yourself versus using a qualified negotiation firm who is honest. Anyone who says they can guarantee results should be questioned. How can someone guarantee what someone else will do? They can't. But, even if you are turned down there is another option. The people at http://www.mortgagenegotiationcenter.com can help you with both of these solutions.

Did you select the direct deposit option?  All of this things matter.  If you chose direct deposit then it should have been deposited into your bank account 8-14 days after your return is "accepted".  Have you received verification that your return was accepted by the IRS?  Also, the state of California isn't issuing a lot of refunds at this time because of the deficit the state is facing.  This has nothing to do with your federal return though.  Good luck!
2N6oTOLQaa	Where you financed your mortgage is irrelevant. If you worked a seller financing deal, you really have a loan from the seller instead of a loan from a bank. For tax purposes, its all the same.     Remember, the $7500 tax credit is really actually a loan. You have to pay back $500 per year for 15 years in the form of higher taxes. However, if you need money now, its basically an interest-free loan with no monthly payments (just smaller refunds at tax time every year).|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	You may have to send in extra paperwork to the IRS to prove you actually bought a house.|`|qBCGH52haa	As long as you otherwise qualify, you should get the tax credit (remember that the present credit must be paid back over 15 years).
znr8SBiWaa	That means you did a RAL (Refund Advance Loan).  You'll receive the rest usually within 8 to 10 days, but maybe a bit longer because of banking delays.
2N6oTOLQaa	Each subscription service is free to set their own terms. We can't say what the polices are for the specific subscription you want because you don't mention what you are subscribing to, I assume its some sort of video game subscription but which one?

Hx88UGlpaa	Unless you plan on financing a vehicle, and paying high interest rates, your luck in finding a personal loan so soon after filing bankruptcy are slim to none. A tight monthly budget, a second job would help pay the regular bills...cut out anything you don't have to have, cable with premiere channels, anything extra on them get rid off...get rid of the cellphone if you  have one and don't need it, or lower minutes, I just did, saved me a bundle.

AA10980750	If your employer was deducting more tax from your wages than he/she was paying to the Revenue Commissioners, then your employer is responsible for the underpayment.   If your employer was not taking enough tax from your wage, then under the INCOME TAX (EMPLOYMENTS) (CONSOLIDATED) REGULATIONS, 2001:  "Recovery of underpayments.   39. (1) If the tax payable under the assessment exceeds the total net tax deducted from the employee's emoluments during the year, the inspector, instead of taking the excess into account in determining the appropriate amount of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point for a subsequent year, may require the employee to remit it to the Collector-General, and, where the inspector so requires, the employee shall remit the excess accordingly on demand made by the Collector-General."

You might find articles on SEO and try them but one can't be SEO expert by just reading articles.    I personally tried optimizing my website after lots of research on SEO and got my website penalized. Finally my friend referred a SEO company he hired for his website and i contacted them. http://www.solutionshall.com    Thanks!|`|LUoZC3ycaa	Hi,     To have your site appear for the above keywords is going to take a lot of seo work. SEO or search engine optimisation is a process of making your pages more search engine friendly and structuring it in such a way that gives your targeted keywords real prominence. Aswell as sorting out on page factors you are also going to have to consider off page factors. This mainly consists of you getting links from other relevant webpages. As well as increasing your link popularity this will also give you more keyword authority.    There is so much more to SEO than above and what I have given is simply a fraction. But a well planned and executed seo campaign will give your pages the best possible chance of exposure. As we are dealing with Google/Yahoo there is no way to guarantee results it will simply be a matter of working hard and tweaking your campaign.    It will probably take 12 months of good seo work to rank well for your chosen keywords but in the mean time you will still want to get traffic to your site.    The best way to do this is by using Google adwords. Adwords is a pay per click system that allows you to pay to have your site positioned at the top of Google's organic listing's.    However Google adwords is not always profitable and much will depend on your ability to create a good campaign and the conversion rates of your visitors.     With both SEO and Adwords you are going to have to do a lot of reading and trialling. It may seem difficult at first but with a bit of hard work you should be ok.     If you do not have the time you will have to hire a company or consultant to do the work for you, however a quality consultant or company does not come cheap and expect to pay between $500 and $1000 pcm.    Hope this gives you some insight and good luck.|`|LWtG5m3maa	While I agree with the first answer here are some additional resources.

If none is taken, hire a lawyer immediately.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	since the supervisor has brushed it off, you need to go above her head - this is a serious matter and management should be taking it more seriously - you can sue them if no one does anything about it - go to the President if necessary|`|xnBnbYBgaa	yes its sexual harrasment. tell your department head and tell them that you are going to file for sexual harrassment on her and that youre going to tell all that are concerned that youre going to let them know that, as the harraser's boss, did nothing but reinforce her behavior. that should get them off their butts as most health care places have enough risk of lawsuits and dont need the publicity of one of their own doing it.

b81H0vlYaa	I had that problem with an advertisement on another site.  What I did is gave them my phone number and said I would like to talk about this in person, well they never called me.  Maybe you could do something similar, like before you give me any money, I would like you to come look at it in person please call me, I know you are deaf but if you could kindly get someone else to.  Or even emailing them back and asking them some type of question, like you can pay me when you come to pick up the piano.  Being something big like that, it is not like you are going to ship it to them.    It doesn't sound legit, but I would hate for you to miss out on the sale, but it would be worse to be scammed.  Why would a deaf person want a piano?  If you really think you must go through with it, give him a PO Box, and say it doesn't have to be overnight.  You can get it sent pretty fast through the USPS.    You are right, do not give them that information they are asking.  Scammers have gotten pretty smart, they could probably cause a lot of problems with just that little bit of info.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I'd give this a really wide berth if I was you. Who has an account officer?? I wouldn't ever give my name or phone number or address to someone I didn't know, and I wouldn't trust anyone who asked for it outright like that either because I think anyone worth trusting wouldn't expect you to just give those details out. It is weird to not want to see it before buying it- especially something so big and unwieldy like a piano, unless they were a dealer or something I suppose but even still. It all sounds really automated too, and why should you remove your listing on the back of a promise made in as fishy a way as this anyway?|`|n0k2ArPwaa	Craigslist has reported scams using phony certified checks, I think.

Never, ever be 5 minutes late on a payment.  Cell phones, utility bills, will come back to haunt you, but you sound like you are ready to start right.  Good luck|`|ve1vK7KLaa	CAUTION------ "WEER" is trying to push you nto a loan!|`|pNy8lakjaa	If capital one doesn't work.. then I would recommend getting a secured card from Bank of America.     What a secured card is, you pay 500.00 to the bank and that is your credit line. They report this to the credit reporting agencies and boom after a year or so you have a nice good credit report that will allow you to do other things!
AA11607818	You can transfer an ISA, but only to an ISA provider that accepts transfers (some don't).  I reckon the set up for a year you speak of is a fixed rate account, ie so much % fixed for one year. I've had a variable rate ISA for years now.
AA11112154	I did this exactly one year ago. Same income, same amount of savings, same rate of savings too! My upper limit was 190K but I ended up buying for 201K in Boston, MA. Remember that upper limit and stick with it.    Get a free credit report with https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/i... You don't get a score but you'll know what's in your report. If you want to purchase the score, make sure it's from all three bureaus.    Sign up for redfin.com. You can look at what's on the market now where you want to buy (if they are available in your area). They can also show you houses. Depending on where you are looking, it may take 6 months before you find a deal that goes through. I started on Feb 14 and closed on Sep 29. The issue is that there are a lot of short sales out there and they take forever to close or they just don't go through so you have to start over. Redfin doesn't do short sale so if you don't mind the wait, you'll have to see a seller's agent.    Don't count on your raise. This economy is too volatile.    Now is a good time to look online and go to open houses. You may choose a Redfin realtor or get a buyer's agent. If I had to do it all over, I would go with Redfin.     Whatever you do, however much money you put down, make sure that you have at least 3 months of your house expenses (taxes, PMI, mortgage, car payment, student loans etc...) saved up. I ended up leaving work after 3 months of buying and managed to have 10 months of my household expenses saved. Now I'm in no rush to start working while I'm going to grad school... the only rush is that I'd like to start saving again.    Depending on where you are, consider buying a duplex or two family house. There may be some work needed but it can be good rental opportunity for which you don't pay more than what you'd pay for a condo/house of your own.    Buy something with at least 2 bedrooms and preferably 1.5-2 baths. It will be good for you if you want to take a roommate (which I did).    I hope this helps. And definitely wait to see when and how the $15K thing is going to take effect. I wish I could get that instead of the $7,500. It would go a long way.    P.S. Start looking at getting pre-approved for the lowest interest rate you can find. I was foolish and was loyal to the bank I got. The minute rates went down, I was too close to closing to find anything else and the bank wouldn't lower my rate. Get a pre-approval letter but keep looking for better rates as you get closer to picking a place. Don't feel bad about leaving the pre-approval broker.    Good luck!|`|NZuJR79oaa	Make sure you can comfortably put down 10% (better if its 20%) and pay closing costs (From $1K to $3K).  Negotiate on the closing costs.  There are several sites that describe what these costs are and where they can come down at.      Do not pay points unless you plan on living in the house for over 10 years and are not going to pay down any on the principle. What determines how much house you can afford is income, not savings rate or savings.  Buy a cheaper house on a 15 yr fixed rate mortgage if you plan on staying there a long time.  This builds equity fast, and you will own your house in 15 years not 30.     Pay a company like Identity Guard to give you your credit report and score so you can get everything neatened up, you don;t want any surprises when you go to buy your home.|`|ZNCGui3eaa	It is great to know that you are thinking about saving and investing for the future. My best advise for you is to talk with a financial adviser. Explain to him your situation and your goals. The first consultation is usually complementary and fee of charge. If you are serious about this, I strongly recommend:  George Papadoyannis, Ameriprise Financial in California.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	I would suggest getting a FHA loan.  They require as little 3% down.  In my RE market sellers often pay most of the buyers closing costs, especially if it a bank owned property (REO).    I would contact a few direct lenders in your area and ask them to pre-qualify you.  Countrywide Mortgage would be a good place to start.  They are competitive in most markets.  Right now FHA loan rates are around 5.5%.  Also the government is giving up to a $7500 tax credit for first time home buyer.  This amount has to be paid back at a rate of $500 a year but is interest free.  Also consider that the interest on the new home loan is tax deductible as well as the property taxes.  That can effectively lower for house payment by about $200-$250 a month.    My suggestion would get a good RE agent and start looking right now.....property prices are at historically low in most areas and the money you are now paying is rent is basically being flushed down the toilet.|`|AA11173563	minimum down payment with FHA is 3.5% of the purchase price. Any thing more than that is fine as well. Just do not deplete the rainy day funds in the process. Most seller will pay the closing cost these days.  $200,000 requires $7,000 down. Now as to the upper limit that all depends on what you owe monthly on car notes student loans and credit cards. If none of those exist then your upper limit may be at 175,000 depending on tax base where you are as well as insurance cost  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY
A6hfzPVNaa	If you entitled to housing benefit obviously council house or the house own by housing association is better since you paying less rent, or non.    The things is if you can rent a home privately you can chose the locations freely unlike council house or housing association.|`|OikNR8Ufaa	I know someone who rents from a housing association and it's a really good thing, new kitchens and bathrooms all the time and she can do whatever she likes to the place to make it her own.     I dont know much about council houses, but a baby was scalded to death in one just down the road from my mums because they failed to replace a dodgy boiler that was in the roof above the kids room, really tragic.     So in my opinion privately might be the better option, although they may be more inclined to suddenly hike the prices up, I dont know :) good luck, and renting is WAY smarter than buying right now :)
2N6oTOLQaa	I would set a price per bedroom, based on how big each bedroom is and what features it has. Obviously, a large master bedroom with a bathroom attached should be higher than a small bedroom with no bathroom. You have to work out something that seems fair.    In your situation, I would think that 60% of rent for the larger bedroom (for you and your BF) and 40% for the smaller one. Then split utilities equally per person so everyone pays 1/3 of bills like electricity, TV/internet, etc.|`|AA11112154	If the place has two bedrooms then you can pay half if the other person agrees. Just keep in mind that your agreement with the other friend must be clear because what's going to happen is that the friend is going to find it unfair because by you two paying half, he/she is paying more than you.    The fair way is to pay 1/3 especially if your room is bigger just as you pay 1/3 for utilities. It may not be fair for you but this one person has to suffer 2 of you instead of one. It's fair to them.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	It depends on the sizes of the room.    If they are more or less the same size, then split 50% for one room and 50% for the other room is fine.    If there is a difference in size, then this needs to be considered.  If one room is double but the other room is single, it's fair to charge up to twice as much for the double.  If they're both doubles but differing sizes, then as an example, if the rent for the house is 250 per week, then the larger room could be 150 per week and the smaller room 100 per week.  Just do something along these lines, taking into account the size of the rooms and how much the total rent is.    The bills should be divided per person, so just split them three ways.|`|sk46uigvaa	Whoever has the largest room with more facilities should pay more.

I've been looking for about 6 years for something that works ...  however i know of many ... can't say they worked for me but if you like arts and crafts i have several things you can check out just let me know ... there is also this thing i just started looking into its called www.adcarjobs.com but there is no need in my area for this ... it costs like $40 to start & you can fill out aps for companys or you can pay another $20 and you fill out 1 ap and they submit it to everyone on there list. some have fees so that helps avoid paying to submit your ap, but its still expensive to find out like i did theres no 'need' in my area .. i also found this thing where you take photos upload them and make $$ and the beauty of it is its FREE and you get 50% of what they make of your photo, like i said i just started so not sure how well it works, but there is some requirements to it ... like your pics have to be 4 megapixels or better to upload and on my computer that takes a long time, you also dont have to give them any personal info like for credit cards or banking, they will mail a check out but for US people you have to wait until you are at $200 before they will mail a check.  And you have to get model releases if there are any identifiable structures or people in the photo so i just take scenery and animal photos and to get started you have to upload a picture of your ID & 10 photos to go through there processing i dont know what that means either but so far i've been doing it for about 3 weeks and they have accepted about half my photos and i haven't figured out how they make $$ of them but i'll give you a link and you can check it out     good luck to you, congrats on the baby, & hope you find something that works for you.    link to photo thing, you mat have to copy paste it|`|Ilme3c41aa	Nobody looks forward to the idea of looking for a job, and the majority of us need all the help we can get. After being jobless recently I got myself a  fantastic job after reading the resource in the box below, I work for myself, making cash from Google!!!|`|vBvgqjjsaa	You said you can't afford to keep internet at your house however most at home work will require that. Try Alpine Access or oDesk.Both companies are really great!
NZuJR79oaa	The problem isn't entirely that the banks made bad decisions, a major factor was the mark to market law, which requires assets to be recorded as what they can be sold for today, not at the present value of future cash flows.  The federal government has laws as to what ratio of assets to debt banks can have.      Since people panicked about possible foreclosure rates becoming 10X what they are now in the sub prime market, the securities holding these notes became worthless because no one wants to buy them, even though they produce cash.  None of these banks became insolvent through cash flow, they became insolvent through these practices of marking assets to what they will sell for today, and not on what they make in cash flow.      Now was there some predatory lending? Absolutely. Were people given loans for homes they could not afford? Yes. Were people given loans who should not be buying a house at all? Yes.  But the majority of this problem falls on these government policies.      Also it was FHA and government policies to make home ownership easier for lower income people and those with bad debt that led to the banks making these loans to begin with.    Another major problem that is pointed out above is that our education system does not require personal micro-economics, which should be taught in depth in fifth, seventh, tenth, and eleventh grade. That way those who do drop out early at least have some basic knowledge, and those that graduate are in excellent shape.|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	We were the stupid ones, trusting anything the government had it's hands in.

They are banking on the fact that we are stupid and will let them continue in their evil ways.  First of all, we need to take back our identities.  Demand that Credit Reporting Agencies require written permission before they release any information to anyone whatsoever.  And make them liable for any misinformation or abuse.  Secondly, ensure that the laws regarding banking and finance are enforced.  Today, those laws have not been enforced and so we have seen a financial collapse.  Thirdly, it is a discriminatory practice to require all kinds of documentation for a mortgage from U.S. Citizens and then allow illegal immigrants and foreigners to get grants for down payments and no doc loans.  I believe, if there was a thorough investigation, the majority of the loans that have defaulted would be to gangsters and illegal immigrants and people who have skirted the law.  The remainder would be the innocents who have been screwed by the banksters and gangsters.    We need to get wise and get wise quick. When the majority of our private information has been outsourced by these banksters to foreign countries, the foreign countries now have the power to commit economic terrorism against us.  Think about it.  When foreign governments have all your personal information -- who you work for, how much you make, where you live, your mother's maiden name, your relatives etc., they have all the ammunition they need to commit identity theft and ruin you and the country along with it.  Don't forget 19 illegal immigrants attacked our country on 9/11/01 and started this financial crisis.  Failure to enforce our immigration laws and protect us from all enemies foreign and domestic has promoted all of this economic terrorism.  Failure to enforce our finance laws and our credit laws and our pension laws has permitted this crisis.  Add to that that the government has failed to live within its means and has gone on a spending spree at all levels while not delivering on its promises in any way, shape or form, has exascerbated the crisis.    I say it's time for Citizens to get tough, oust the do nothings.  Refuse a bailout because it is only going to cost every citizen -- we'll gain nothing and let the chips fall where they may.  We, the people, will survive.  Let the banks and companies struggle just like we do to survive and then we can build at home to renew ourselves instead of taking care of the world.  We, the people have the power if we'll only use it!|`|j6SUkE4Raa	my opinion is that if you dont have the cash upfront to buy  it,you cant get a loan under mylaw!

Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted proccessing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?

AA10934899	To qualify for any of the 501(c) statuses (the tax status that allows donors to deduct contributions and the business to be exempt from federal income tax), the business must be a legal entity separate from the individual. This may be a corporation or an LLC. The federal tax return is the 990.     There are state and local implications, too, such as state income tax, sales tax, property taxes, etc. which vary from state-to-state. Incorporation itself is a state function and the costs vary as to the form of incorporation (corp or LLC). Each state has an equivalent tax return and there are likely other annual forms to submit to various state and local entities (eg. exempt business property declaration).    If all you are is an "unincorporated association," for example, all you are doing is collecting money for a ski trip for your school band, you may not have to do anything at all. You would not qualify for tax exemptions nor qualify as a charitable deduction. Again, this varies by state.|`|COpP9JDqaa	All Non-Profits need to register with their state taxation department as a 501-C Organization.

z3TIcyI6aa	OK, there are two ways to do this.    1: You CAN claim JSA AND look after someone BUT you must still be looking for work as well. So you could claim JSA, care for your mum BUT work a part time job or under 16 hours a week    I did this when my mum got terminal renal cancer. I wasn't looking after for enough hours a week (to get carers allowance) as she had nurses and other family members.    So I took a job for 3 days a week AND looked after her as well. I was working full time before and then had to quit as she got sick and I quit BECAUSE she got sick, so you can still claim JSA immediately after quiting your job as it comes under special circumstances.    So yes you CAN claim JSA AND care for someone but you still must be able to look for a job and be available for interviews etc. This CAN be part time or under 16 hours a week.    OR 2:    Claim carers allowance full time. BUT she must be getting either Incapacity benefit (Or Employment support allowance for new claims) or Disability living allowance for you to get it.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    You say you stopped working?

xJi3ixgGaa	I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	No.    There is no law yet and the specifics are unknown.|`|7a8UzxkRaa	As of now it is not law.|`|6YVckVa2aa	the new economic stimulus plan has not been officially enacted.

You don't get to choose to pay when filing, that is NOT the law and is not your choice.   Filing Exempt or 9 allowances when you are not entitled to do so means you'll likely be subject penalties and interest.    This is being penny wise and pound foolish, in addition to violating law.|`|NrvrH4zQaa	The IRS considers this situation an underpayment and may charge you interest.  They want you to pay through withholding or quarterly estimated payments at least 90% of your tax obligation for the year, or at least 100% of your prior year obligation.  The current rate is 6%, so an underpayment of $9k (averages to $4.5k for the year) would be about $270.  The IRS will likely send you a bill after they get your tax return.|`|VI2dc4xcaa	As far as I know, and I may be wrong, there's no penalty if you pay what you owe.|`|6Cp41lb6aa	There is a penalty for owing too much (or not having enough withheld during the year).    If you owe more than $1,000, then the IRS has a test based on this year's return and last year's return to see how much (if any) penalties you have to pay.    If you owe less than $1,000, then just write the check on April 15, and all's well.|`|W9H8J76kaa	If you owe a lot, you can be charged interest.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	You'll owe it all at tax time.  If you can't pay, they will be angry.  Usually they want their payments quarterly to avoid unpleasant situations.|`|6YVckVa2aa	Jeff is correct. I just did my taxes, and saw this penalty warning come up on when doing my taxes. You should check the irs website to see what the penalties guidelines are, if you underpaid alot.
cLtzGveRaa	If all else fails... some good suggestions here, one definitely not so good, you can approach a reputable mortgage broker.  They often can get better results from the bank as they have better working relationships with them, and they will be more likely to work with you as well.    Take them the proof of payments and explain the situation to them.  Take your own copy of your credit report with score in with you so they don't have to run it if they cannot help you and talk to them about it.  Most will get into contact with their bank associates and see if they can find somebody willing to work with you anyway.    Credit unions can also sometimes be a good alternative.|`|ve1vK7KLaa	What is being done to you is unfortunate, but it is LEGAL!  If you look at it from their standpoint, it makes sense 'for them'!  They don't want you out searching for new credit, not as long as you owe them.  It is to their advantage to let pmts go unreported.  Sorry!|`|AA11173563	there is no law that makes any vendor report. The fact that you filed a BK is the main thing that is stopping you. Now if discharged for three years then FHA will do the note and the loan officer must get a pay history from them that's all that is needed as far as the mortgage pay history is concerned  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No law requires any lender to report to credit bureaus.  You can, however, dispute the "delinquent" status report.|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	They are horrible to deal with on credit issues.  They take delight in ruining one's credit.  Just keep all documentation organized.  They are evil.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	First did you "Reaffirm" the mortgage.  If you didn't reaffirm the mortgage they will not update the credit report because it is still technically in Bankruptcy.  However, if this is the case CitiMortgage is required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act(FCRA) to report true and correct information.  This means that it must be stated as "Included in Bankruptcy" and not "Delinquent"    Now, if you did reaffirm the mortgage and you are current they must either remove the listing(since there is no requirement it must be listed at all) or list that you are current.  However, they do not have to update it on a regular basis.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	If you have your cancelled checks, cashed bt the mortgage company within the grace period,  you can use these as verification of you current mortgage payments. The credit bureau is correct, if a lender refuses to report to a credit bureau that's their business and. The credit bureaus have no authorization to force a creditor to report to them. If you do not have can celled checks, look on the reserve side of your bank statements, most times that's where they are. You can also just use your bank statement, the exact amout of your mortage should be on all the statements. If all esle fails, call CitiBank and ask what department handles accepting mortgage. Ask them to carefullyreview their records, If it was some kind of mix up tranferring from the other mortgage to the current ine and get it in writig
