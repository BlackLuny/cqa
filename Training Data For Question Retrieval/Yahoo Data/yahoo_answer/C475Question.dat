20090131082823AADN6H0	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Home Centralized Heating Not Working, Any Suggestions Please?	Hi,      We are a first time home owner and we are living in the house for the 2nd year now.      This winter, the centralized heater has stopped working. We don't know what caused it.      If I turn on the fan on the wall control, it works. However if I put it on heating, it doesn't blow out any air cold or hot.      I checked the basement where the unit is located and I see no faults. The only problem I see is a clear tubing where some sort of water has collected and is leading to the outside. Unfortunately, the water in this tubing isn't draining. Could this be the cause of our heater malfunction?      Any experts can shed some light? We are slowly freezing in our house. We'd probably be dead if it weren't for space heaters.      Thank you and Please help this cold soul.

For the last week we have had extreme hot weather conditions, and my rhododendrons and camellias in particular have really suffered badly.   Some ( most ) of the leaves have been burnt and are brown, and what aren't burnt are really droopy and looking VERY unhealthy.   Sadly with our water restriction laws and no rain in sight for a few days I am unsure how they are going to cope, and what things I should be doing.      My question is, should I cut back all of the dead branches and basically strip the trees right back, or should I just let them go and hope for the best?   Is feeding them now the wrong time? ( we are in the middle of summer)      They have been in the ground for several years and coped with many summers before, but never have they been this badly damaged.
