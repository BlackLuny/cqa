xf7Gufk2aa	I've got one, had it for ages and I love it! I do find that when I first start it up and it asks whether I want to start in normal or flight mode it can be quite slow in responding to the 'ok' button but you can set it so that it doesn't ask this.<br>  <br>  It's a really good phone - filled with all sorts of fun tools and bits and pieces to play around with. Easy to text on, good for calling, the cameras really good. Oh and the mp3 player and music quality are awesome.<br>  <br>  Would definitely recommend it :-)|`|TW9gb3QDaa	i don't think so ive had one for a little while now and it is working great <br>  the only problem is that every now and again the number keys flash after you charge it but overall good phone
bRN1XNOCaa	flamethrower or ray gun...just get into the glitch with the flamethrower and you will get far...trust me|`|AA10341097	okay there are 4 key guns to describe. all of these guns you can only get through the mystery box in the "HELP" room downstairs<br>  <br>  FLAMETHROWER - The flamethrower only works well if you get into a glitch because then you have unlimited ammo and they cannot touch you but flamethrower is ONLY good if in glitch, otherwise, it doesn't kill them fast enough<br>  <br>  RAY GUN - The ray gun will kill any zombie in 1 shot but the problems with the ray gun are that it doesn't have that big of a magazine clip so you will have to be reloading quite a bit which leaves you vulnerable to hordes or zombies in the later levels when they comin at you fast and it only carries 100 total bullets so you're gonna have to get max ammo quite a bit or keep getting lucky at the mystery box<br>  <br>  MG42 and DEPLOYABLE BROWNING - these are the best 2 guns in my opinion for zombies because they have the largest clip sizes and the some of the faster fire rates. the damage is pretty good so if you hold both of those guns, you can do some serious damage|`|EXsmBrhbaa	flamethrower and ray gun if your going for the farthest level you can get to<br>  <br>  mg42 and browning .30 cal if your goin for fun and want lots of kills<br>  <br>  ray gun and browning .30 cal if you wanna get buck|`|L7edxm1waa	Hmm i would say spam the chest out in the help/hell door and get the flame thrower and get the ray gun too and it always help to have a buddy with a mower gun =) ( MG42 good mower)

885c0806c9b2d818c143ed380999933daa	Well, first of all, what you want is a "wireless device"; "Bluetooth" is the technology that comes with all wireless devices.<br>  <br>  I wish everyone would stop calling them bluetooth.......ugh!<br>  <br>  To answer your question, though, I would look into the Plantronics 925 Discovery model; the call clarity is superb, it's really stylish (if that matters to you), but the best thing I like about the device is that it's a "multi-point" device, meaning that, since I have two phones (one for personal use; one for business use), I can have both phones connected to the device to receive calls. Most other wireless devices don't have that capability.<br>  <br>  By the way, it's on my ear (in my picture).
pZGLhV2Waa	I would say the 400D is the better camera overall but it is an older model. The 400D has been replaced by the 450D and is more similar to that camera. The 1000D was designed to be a cheaper entry level model. It does have a couple of things the 400D does not have like live view. It is however a newer camera. If you can get a good deal on the 400D I personally would take it over the 1000D. If not the 1000D would be a fine choice.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The 400D is now an older model (released in 2006), so may be difficult to find. However, it's still a very good camera.<br>  Instead, I recommend either the 1000D or the slightly better, 450D (which is the update to the 400D).|`|d55HYaktaa	The 1000D (XS) is a upgraded and downgraded version of the 400D (XTi) at same time.<br>  <br>  They removed some features from the 400D (buffer for continuous shooting speed, 9-point AF) and added others (live view, digic III processor).<br>  <br>  Both cameras have the same sensor. The 1000D has a better noise removal processing, but the weaker antialiasing filter results in awful moir√© patterns.<br>  <br>  They created the 1000D from the 400D to compete agains the Nikon D60, because the 450D is more expensive than the D60.<br>  <br>  I think the 400D (XTi) is a better camera. But it was discontinued by Canon.
Pw1fCNvXaa	most point and shoot cameras themselves arent very good in low light, so i doubt any camera phone, however many megapixels or whatever features theyre touting, can perform well in low light without producing a lot of noise.

RCbtRF4xaa	I recommend Samsung Touch Of Color T220HD 22-inch LCD HDTV Monitor.This monitor is excellent for what it is. It's a good monitor and a decent HDTV at a very good price. There are some better monitors out there - even in this price range. There are much better TVs, but they cost more. But if you need a good monitor that is also a decent HDTV, this is your best option by far. Yes, the body and stand are a bit flimsy. There are no composite or S-video inputs - so you cannot use it to view VHS or mini-DV tapes. I have an old TV that I use for that. The power button does not really work; you have to use the remote. It's not as bright as LCD TVs. But none of that matters much to me. This monitor works great as a computer monitor, and it's fine as a HDTV. I don't really notice a different between it and the higher end 22" LCD TVs in stores. I am sure that there is a difference, but I don't care enough about the TV function to notice. The only thing that I really miss on this monitor is PiP (Picture in Picture). My old 17" Samsung LCD has that. It is really nice that the monitor comes with both analog and digital computer cables; nice touch. My 17" Samsung is 5+ years old now and works like new.<br>  <br>  Samsung Touch Of Color T220HD 22-inch LCD HDTV Monitor<br>  Price: $297.99 free shipping<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Touch-T220HD-22-inch-Monitor/dp/B0019HGTLC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236698778&sr=1-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Touch-T220...</a>

SoKd4jGAaa	The FX1e is a good camera, very good. Picks up low light very well, however it has a lower lux (6) and lower zoom rate. The FX7e is also very good having a lux of 4, it picks up skin blemishes much better and the colour is displayed very well and I would go as far as to say the FX7e's colour is better than the FX1e. I have recently sold my FX1e to get the FX1000e which is much better and is really worth it.|`|3CJAUyqPaa	The FX1 handles low-light better. The FX7 has a higher built-in zoom rate.<br>  <br>  I bought the FX1 on this "tradeoff"... I can get a lens for the FX1 to increase the zoom if needed - I cannot do anything to the FX7 to improve its low-light capability unless I use a video light.<br>  <br>  This does not necessarily make the FX1 a "better all around camera" but for my requirements, low light behavior is more important.<br>  <br>  You will also need an XLR adapter (check juicedLink or BeachTek, among others) to use pro-grade mics that use XLR connectors.<br>  <br>  Both are miniDV tape based prosumer cams - and require firewire connection to your computer for importing DV/HDV. USB won't work - and USB-firewire hub/converter/adapter/cable things won't work, either.

j5Apt8hWaa	The first touch screens tended to scratch over time.  There are protectors you can buy if you want to be super safe.  While touch screens are a big deal for certain people, I find using buttons to be faster for me and while touch screen iPhones, P&S cameras by Sony and Nikon look cool in adverts, they have their drawbacks ... other than scratching, they burn battery power like mad.<br>  <br>  Look at similar Sony or Nikon P&S cameras vs. their non-touch screen cousins and you will see that the number of shots per battery charge is much lower on touch screen cameras

It's only pro would be that it shoots in RAW, but you would always have to shoot in RAW if you want the best that it offers.<br>  <br>  A dSLR has much better ISO performance and allows you to buy additional lenses for it. The only con (for some people, maybe) is... buying good lenses for it will cost extra.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	Rebel XS is a FANTASTIC value...as long as you don't buy it for full retail price. I believe full retail for the kit with the EF-S 18-55mm IS lens is about $600, but I bought it on Amazon for about $500. There are deals to be had on this camera, so make sure you find them. <br>  CNET has a good review of this camera, so I'll just list the pros and cons as I see them. <br>  <br>  PROS <br>  -Phenomenal photo quality/color fidelity <br>  -Intuitive menu/user interface <br>  -Sensor cleaner <br>  -Lightweight, comfortable to hold <br>  -Fast autofocus <br>  -Basically non-existent shutter lag <br>  -Takes only about 1 second to turn the camera on and take a picture <br>  -Compatible with almost all recently (last 10-15 years) manufactured Canon lenses <br>  -10.1 MP is PLENTY <br>  -Poster size prints are excellent (as long as pictures are crisp) <br>  <br>  CONS <br>  -Relatively few photos per second (3 in ideal lighting conditions) <br>  -Multiple frames per second requires ideal lighting conditions <br>  -Lack of spot metering makes taking pictures with lots of contrast VERY difficult (i.e. sunlight through trees or behind landscape). This is my biggest complaint with the camera. <br>  -Not compatible with wireless remote control <br>  -Kit lens is not great in low light conditions <br>  -Lenses with image stabilization are very expensive <br>  <br>  Overall, this is, in my opinion a terrific starter's digital SLR. <br>  <br>  Canon Rebel XS 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-10-1MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B001CBKJGG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236701544&sr=1-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-10-1MP-Digit...</a>|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Depends on what you want out of your camera.

Most of these pictures were made with various Olympus DSLR models and Zuiko (Olympus lenses brand name) lenses.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robs-photo-memory/sets/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/robs-photo-...</a><br>  <br>  It is particularly noteworthy that the Oly "kit" lenses are usually rated better than those of most other manufacturers.<br>  <br>  There is some controversy over one of the innovations from Olympus. The design of the Four/Thirds sensor used by all of their DSLR cameras because of the small sensor size and Aspect Ratio of 4/3. But these same innovations make it possible to design the smaller lighter cameras and lenses they are renowned for producing.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a Four/Thirds forum where you can find out much more detail about the cameras from Olympus, Panasonic and Leica that conform to the Four/Third standard.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.four-thirds.org/en/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.four-thirds.org/en/index.html</a><br>  <br>  P.S. You might want to seriously consider the just announced E-620 as it has some significant "upgrades" to the E-410 and E-510.<br>  <br>  HTH.<br>  Email me if you want more details or specific information.|`|bmKhbWiTaa	Any camera deal that offers 2 lenses is a better deal. If you purchase a second lens later on, it would cost you a lot more. It now depends on which model you want. Most cameras have different levels of lenses: enter level and the better quality ones and the professional ones which will cost a lot more.   <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|pZGLhV2Waa	The Olympus is a good quality camera. They have been around for years. They use the 4/3 system just like point and shoot cameras. This allows the cameras to be smaller and lighter than other DSLR's that use a 3:2 aspect ratio like 35mm film. The only downside is that they use the smallest sensor of all DSLR's.

Change the emulation speed to Realtime auto *2 (fastest). Change sound output to digital stereo. Change NDS Cartridge backup media to Flash 512k (so it can save ingame).

Play a bit and save as soon as you can (to check whether it can), with whatever you assigned the x key. <br>  5. Quit the emulator! If you don't the save file won't be generated!<br>  6. Open the rom again. If the continue option is there, it should be. If it isn't or something went wrong, email me. Before you do that, check whether you've done the steps right.<br>  7.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The Sandisk Extreme III is an excellent card...however, this 30mb/sec 16GB version is probably overkill for the 450D. I would instead recommend the regular Extreme III SDHC card. It's plenty fast enough for the 450D (and it's continuous shooting) and is also cheaper and also available to buy with a micromate card reader, whereas the card you have linked, does not come with a reader (which you will need if you want to transfer your files). It's actually much faster to use a card reader, rather than direct camera to computer connection.<br>  <br>  Also, 16MB is a very large capacity...much larger than you really need for general day to day use. It's best to always transfer your images at the end of a day's shooting, so I doubt if you would really need 16MB capacity. A 4GB to 8GB card might be more practical.<br>  <br>  Each 4GB of capacity will allow you to shoot approx...<br>  920 high quality Jpegs or<br>  240 RAW images or<br>  198 RAW + Jpeg images<br>  <br>  So, do you think you would really need 16MB?<br>  <br>  p.s don't forget to always Format a brand new card before use and everytime you want to delete all files from it.|`|4GtrHkzsaa	Yes.  It will hold an insane number of pictures.  Just make sure you back it up so that if you lose the card, you still have the pictures somewhere else.

SKkE3fK1aa	What would you want? A smartphone or a cellphone? <br>  <br>  The 6210 is a Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 (S60v3 FP2) Smartphone powered by Symbian OS 9.3. <br>  <br>  The 5610 XM is a Nokia Series 40 cellphone powered by a proprietary OS from Nokia.<br>  <br>  Smartphones increase your productivity if have good apps for it. You can install a lot of application and games for it. The 6210 comes with QuickOffice (Word PowerPoint, Excel viewer), Adobe Reader (Adobe PDF viewer) when you buy it. It also has a good HTML Browser with Flash Lite 3.0 support if you wanna have a great mobile web experience. Also, the smartphone is practically useless if you dont get applications for it. Maybe if you upgrade your QuickOffice to 6.0 so you can view and edit 2007 word, powerpoint and excel documents? Also, getting an english dictionary and thesaurus with audio support is fine.6210 is also an N-Gage 2.0 compatible phone, so you wanna go check out their Next-Gen games first.<br>  <br>  The 5610 XM is a typical cellphone even with the music slider feature below the LCD Display. The 5610 is good for your typical cellphone features like Call, Text, Music, Video, Pictures, Bluetooth, Internet (WAP not WEB; WAP is the 'mobile web' and not really content-rich), and whatever you expect from a cellphone. You can also get apps and games for it but only in Java. You can't install any Symbian-based apps or games on it as it is NOT a Symbian-based smartphone, its just a cellphone with Nokia's Operating System (OS).<br>  <br>  >> Conclusion: Get the 6210 if you will get apps for it and willing to pay the price with the result of being more productive. You should only get it if you are really going to need smartphone features. Get the 5610 XM if you are just a consumer looking for basic features. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG GETTING A BASIC PHONE THAN SPENDING OVER A PHONE THAT YOU ARE NOT GONNA USE.<br>  <br>  >>> Also, it's like your choosing a DSLR camera over a compact digital camera.|`|N8fB7vJGaa	buy the nokia 5610. it hold an extra 4 gig memory. and the music is way betta (the quality)

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Cinema and movie theater are synonyms, so there isn't a difference.<br>  <br>  If you want 5.1, 6.1 or 7.1 surround sound you will need not just speakers, but an amplifier (aka receiver) too.  You can buy each separately or you can buy them bundled in what's called a "home theater in a box", or HTIB.<br>  <br>  As with any other electronics equipment, there is a wide spectrum of features available, with prices to match.  Since you already have a player, you want an HTIB based on a receiver, not a DVD player (as most of them are).<br>  <br>  In my opinion the best value for such a system is made by Onkyo.  For full HDMI use, check out the Onkyo HT-S6100 HTIB.  It's a 7.1 system.  You can get it online for around $600.<br>  <br>  Or, if you want to do it yourself, get the Onkyo TX-SR606 (~$450) receiver and a set of 5.1 speakers.  There are many out there, but in my opinion Polk makes a solid home theater set called the RM6750 that sell for under $250.<br>  <br>  There are less expensive options, but none that I know of that feature HDMI switching.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	Speakers are speakers - they all make sounds.<br>  <br>  But there is a bit of difference between Music and Home Theater speakers.<br>  <br>  In general: Music is about accuracy and home theater is about impact.<br>  <br>  You can get a great movie experience with a set of speakers selling for about $500-$1000 when properly setup and with a good subwoofer.<br>  <br>  But these speakers are ... less accurate, less detailed and do not work so good for music.<br>  <br>  Music speakers tend to be more sensitive and much more expensive than home theater speakers.  This is for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  WHAT SPEAKERS TO GET<br>  <br>  You should only consider speakers from .. a speaker company.  Ignore anything by Sony, Samsung, Phillips, Yamaha, etc.  These companies do not make good speakers.<br>  <br>  Look at Energy, Polk, Klipsch, Boston, Definitive Technology, Anthony Gallow, etc.<br>  <br>  Then - make sure to get a good subwoofer.  Unlike your 5 other speakers you can get a sub from a different company as you dont have to match the sub to the other speakers.<br>  <br>  Some very good subwoofer companies also make speaker/sub combos like "SVS".<br>  <br>  You want to get a set of 5 monitor-style speakers and a self-powered subwoofer.  This gives you a great setup to enjoy movies and an upgrade path later if  you want to improve the bass with a better sub later.|`|ysclTmCoaa	They are one and the same.<br>  <br>  I take it you're aware that you can't just buy speakers and link them to the TV/ Blu-Ray?

Launch the video editor or import utility and click "capture" or import. Some miniDV tape based camcorders can also capture stills to a memory card. Use the USB cable for this (never connect the firewire and USB cables to the computer and the camcorder at the same time) or take the memory card out and use a card reader. MiniDV tape saving to DV or HDV continue to provide "best available video quality" due to least amount of compression applied to the digital video stream. MovieMaker can deal with DV; cannot deal with HDV.<br>  <br>  Flash memory and hard disc drive camcorders use a USB cable to mount the memory as a "mass storage device". Copy the files; convert them to a format your editor can deal with. StreamClip and HandBrake are good utilities to start with. Flash memory and HDD camcorders save to very highly compressed MPEG2 (Standard definition) or AVCHD (MTS - high definition) file types. MovieMaker cannot deal with AVCHD files.<br>  <br>  Standard definition DVD camcorders require you to finalize the disc, take the disc out of the camcorder and rip the video using a DVD ripper (like HandBrake). No cable required. The ripper will convert the VOB file to something the editor can deal with. This is the worst possible video quality and should be avoided for any video you want to edit or otherwise transfer to a computer for any other use.<br>  <br>  For high definition DVD camcorder files, those are AVCHD - take the disc out of the camcorder and copy the video files from the disc to the computer - presuming your video editor can deal with the AVCHD format. MovieMaker cannot. Again, no cable needed.<br>  <br>  Some pocket cameras that take Motion JPEG video or .mov file types also use a USB cable to copy the video files - and they need to be converted, too. StreamClip or HandBrake - there are MANY others.<br>  <br>  In ALL cases (excluding DVD based camcorders), you need to also connect the power cable to the camcorder and a working AC power outlet. You do not want to run out of battery power when transferring files as they can corrupt the video file. With DVD based camcorders, you need to plug into power when "finalizing" the disc. Running ouit of power before that step is complete will result in a corrupted video file that will be very challenging to use for anything (ISOBuster can sometimes help).<br>  <br>  So...<br>  <br>  "Press one key" = miniDV tape.<br>  <br>  SD cards: Canon FS (standard definition) or HF (high definition - AVCHD) series camcorders.<br>  <br>  There's normally WAY more to selecting a camcorder - like your budget, what type of zoom you think you want, how it behaves in low-light environments, mic jack, manual audio controls...<br>  <br>  Good luck...

Then click in the box alongside "Display album artwork on my iPod", then sync and there you are.|`|8qKdoaNkaa	I encountered this problem when i first got my ipod touch<br>  Each individual song needs to have an album artwork,not 1 song in the album,it may appear to be in your itunes cover-flow but all the songs (accept the one you added) do not have artwork<br>  It may take a long time to add each individual artwork so maybe you can right-click an album and click get album artwork (this only works if you have an itunes account)<br>  <br>  Hope this will work for you

I love free HD with a simple outdoor antenna instead of paying and I get 25 digital channels free and that's good since I dont watch much. I just got a HDTV for my modded xbox 360 so I can play my bootlegged games. gears of war 2 is a good one.|`|f6dxZXPGaa	I have a Digital Satellite at home and it has about 1700 Channels...<br>  Most of the Channels are from Europe , Asia and few American , Canadian...<br>  <br>  I Don't watch much too , Only if there is a News or Sport
NUwdSa7Caa	yes they will notice|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	Yep|`|XKiMAh39aa	Yes it affects it in certain occasions but you cant stay forever invisible to them they will and will find you whatever you do <br>  <br>  for hunters they rely much on sound as for all for playable AIs because your outline gradually disappears if you walk(by holding shift while walking) crouch walk, or stand. but when this happens they rely on their sight to find which is more easy with your lights on<br>  <br>  in short you cant keep a low profile to all of the infecteds except for witches|`|dQj0wMRpaa	Standard zombies will notice lights, but it does not make much of a difference, they will still 'hear' you with your flashlight off.  The AI in that game are amazing they are designed to be alerted the same way predatory animals are.  The witch is considered a boss and has light programmed  as an "enraging" prompt.  The hunters are designed and programmed to stay as 'stealthy' as possible and usually see you  long before you see them with or without a flashlight.  Smokers are similar but try to blend in crowds farther away to 'tongue drag' single players away and weaken the team.  Boomers are very oblivious to light and noise and usually only attack once you've shot at, or stepped practically right in front of one.  Tanks are programmed very sensitive to sound more than anything and will come running from a long ways away towards the sound of your gun-shots.   (I figured for 10 points The least I could do is break each AI down for ya).|`|kDz9gcMuaa	They notice you anyway think about the films like resident evil zombies are menat to be able to smell live flesh.

Bricked=Broked|`|LNhsRsphaa	Bricked, is a term used to express when something "is as useful as a brick".<br>  <br>  When a PSP is bricked, it does not turn on, flicking the power switch to turn the PSP on, will result in the green power light illuminating for several seconds, then going out, but nothing else happens.<br>  <br>  This is caused by the firmware on the PSP becoming corrupt, either by when updating the psp's firmware, the process was intrupted, or simply through an error on the firmware causing it to corrupt it self.<br>  <br>  The firmware on the PSP is much like an operating system on a computer (i.e windows) when this becomes faulty and not working, your computer no longer works, until you fix it, by reinstalling the operating system, in the PSP's case, you can fix it by reinstalling the firmware.<br>  <br>  To reinstall the firmware, there are ways of doing it yourself, but its complicated, requires some research and possibly purchasing parts such as the well known pandora battery.<br>  <br>  A simple cost effective fix, is to visit a company such as <a href="http://www.psp-repairz.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-repairz.co.uk/</a>  who for a small fee, can repair your 'bricked psp' for you.|`|6H5IB26Oaa	He broke it in some way so all it's good for now is as a weight, like a brick.

dC7d5sy5aa	First check your TV as 720p and 1080i/p are all considered to be HD.<br>  If you have a 720p TV just stick with the component cables and do not go to HDMI. <br>  The following is a list from best to worst including their resolution capabilities for transport:<br>  <br>  HDMI (1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  Component (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  S-Video (480i)<br>  Composite (480i)<br>  Coaxial (480i)<br>  <br>  Save the money towards getting a 1080p TV.<br>  Once you have this then you can upgrade to an HDMI cable.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between expensive and budget HDMI cables. It revolves around the quality of the cable build and the materials used. The question is whether this will affect my set up. First you should determine the length between your source and your display. If this is less than 15 feet a "standard" cable will be ok. If it is more than 15 feet you are best to consider a "high speed" cable. Make sure that you buy from a reputable source and that the cable is marked with the HDMI logo and says that it is a version 1.3 (don't worry about a, b or c as these are only testing protocols) If you live in a coastal or high humidity area it is worth considering getting a cable with gold connectors. While this will not improve your signal it will stop corrosion degrading the signal over time.<br>  <br>  You can never improve a digital signal by using an expensive cable but you can certainly degrade a signal using an inferior cable.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	I suggest using an HDMI cable instead.<br>  Thats what I use. <br>  Also, an LCD is better, the plasma was one of the first generations.<br>  So an LCD is better, crystal clear pictures.<br>  I also would suggest getting a samsung, or sharp. One of the best brands out there.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|qaPyaFUcaa	The HD component cables that come with it are fine, they can output to all available resolutions.  However, most TV's will not accept 1080p through the component cables for some reason, so you have to try it first.  If you can get 1080p, that is the best resolution, so there is no need to buy anything else.<br>  <br>  If you can't get 1080p with component, either stick with 720p (1080i isn't as good for games) or get an HDMI cable for the 1080p quality picture.  HDMI is a digital connection so any cheap connector will work just as good as an expensive one, so just get a cheap one.<br>  <br>  For LCD vs. Plasma, that usually depends on the size of your TV.  Smaller flat panel TV's are all LCD and large flat panel TV's are all Plasma.  There is a gray area, say between 42 and 52 inches where you can get both.  As the other answerer said, plasma has been around longer, but that does not mean it's old technology, that means it's been through R&D longer.  Plasma TV's will almost always give a better picture than an LCD TV of the same size.

LvYOURPXaa	Hi,<br>  First off, "jailbreaking" your ipod device is against the Apple service terms and conditions, in which you agreed to abide by. Anyway, if you bring your ipod to the Apple store, they will know if it is jailbroken or not. Jailbreaking your ipod can really mess it up, and once you jailbreak it, you are no longer covered for it.<br>  <br>  Hope I answered your question?
QHqGpJZ5aa	Probably not, big national companies like Verizion usually don't haggle prices with individual people. What they offer is what you get usually.

xTioPxaVaa	Did the guitar work before you restrung it?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've got a loose ground wire inside the guitar.  If the ground came loose from the output jack, that would cause this problem.  I don't know why you can hear the guitar when you touch the bridge.  If the ground wire for the bridge came loose, it would still pass the signal from the pickups, but would tend to hum more.<br>  <br>  You probably should take the guitar to a good guitar tech and have them check it out.  It's probably just going to take a quick touch up with a soldering iron to fix it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken

mHD3Q7Rjaa	Please don't buy electronics off Craig's Llist. It is not safe nor is it reliable. If you need to buy an Ipod from a third party, you should buy it off Ebay. Ebay ensures authenticity and it also has scam insurance. If the product doesn't work, you can send it back for your money back. If you're buying an Ipod from third party because you can not afford one. You should look into buying from Apple. They offer Refurbished Ipods which are really good. I have one. It's a lot cheaper than the originals because they are the Ipods that used to have dents and scratches. They get sent back to Apple to be fixed and Apple can't sell them to consumers as new so they are called refurbished. They are reliable. They have one year warranties on them and they are the real deal.

But go for the D700 if you can afford it, of course. It's the best for weddings.<br>  <br>  The D700 is a full frame camera, not like your D70s that has an APS-C sensor (1.5x crop). Probably you will need new lenses for the D700.<br>  <br>  You will need a 70-200mm f/2.8 VR AF-S as a tele zoom lens for the D700, and a 24-70mm f/2.8 VR AF-S to be a wide/short-tele zoom.<br>  <br>  I think you already have a wide/short-tele zoom for your D70s, but it won't work fine on this full frame. Also, if you get a tele zoom for your D70s like the 55-200mm f/4.0-5.6 VR, you will have 2 bodys with wide/short-tele and long-tele zooms for each one. A full backup of all needed focal length range:<br>  <br>  D700 + 24-70 f/2.8 VR + 70-200 f/2.8 VR<br>  D70s + 18-70 (27-105) f/3.5-4.5 + 55-200 (85-300) f/4.0-5.6<br>  <br>  The D700 it's the best for weddings because it have a cleaner output when using high-ISO, it is smaller than the D3 and returns the same image quality less money. But you may get the D3 instead of the D700. The D3 is faster for sports - it has a faster autofocus, faster continuous shooting speed and connection for studio flash.<br>  <br>  Also you may get [some] SB-600 flashs to use as wireless-controled slaves, like the D70s does. Your camera can handle one group of flashs, D80/90 can handle 2 groups of flashs, and the D200/D300/D700/D3 can handle 3 groups (the flash exposure is configured for each group in the flash controller, not for each flash unit). The Nikon's creative lighting system is very good.<br>  <br>  btw... you may save money by replacing the D700+24-70mm+70-200mm by a D300 with a 17-55mm f/2.8 and the same 70-200mm f/2.8 VR:<br>  <br>  D300 + 17-55 (25-85) f/2.8 VR + 70-200 f/2.8 VR<br>  D70s + 18-70 (27-105) f/3.5-4.5 + 55-200 (85-300) f/4.0-5.6 VR<br>  <br>  But if you cannot afford this pro stuff, you may get just a D90 with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6. Also you should get a 55-200mm f/4.0-5.6 VR if you don't have it:<br>  <br>  D90 + 18-105 (27-158) f/3.5-5.6 VR<br>  D70s + 18-70 (27-105) f/3.5-4.5 + 55-200 (85-300) f/4.0-5.6 VR<br>  <br>  Also you may get just a D90 with the 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 VR instead of the 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 VR.<br>  <br>  The D80 or the D90 is at the same level of the D70s, just more megapixels, less noise and new features (like the software-based cromatic aberration and distortion correction of D90). The D200 and D300 has a better autofocus system and a better body structure. Also they work with tilt-shift and manual mettering lenses.<br>  <br>  The D40 and D60 are not better than your D70s. I think it's not worth for you buying these new entry-level cameras.<br>  <br>  Anyway, please tell us what lenses and flashs you already have, so we may give a better recommendation for you.

I was relatively satisfied, however I soon found that I basically I only used my iPod when I go places, not in my house where I have WiFi.<br>  As a result I chose to sell my Touch purchase a 120 GB iPod Classic which arrived in the mail a couple of days ago.  I enjoy having all of my music on one device, however I would have liked a cheaper, smaller option.  As you say, I definitely don't think a 32 GB Touch is worth $400, however I only have ~35 GB of music so I would have liked a 60 or 80 GB Classic option.<br>  In all I think it is up to the user.  If you plan to use your iPod mostly for music, go with a Classic.  If you want features, go with a Touch.<br>  Or if you watch a lot of video, and want a bigger screen, go with a Touch.  Keep in mind that it will run the battery down very quickly though.  It also depends of course on how much music capacity you want.  I would definitely not recommend the 32 GB Touch though, that's just a waste of money.<br>  Also keep in mind that you can save a significant amount of money buying refurbished.  I have purchased all but my first iPod refurbished and I highly recommend that option.  They come pristine and you still get a warranty.<br>  <br>  I live in Seattle where it has been snowing much more than usual lately and I can say I miss being able to check my iPod to see if there is school without having to wait 5 minutes for my computer to turn on.  The Facebook app was also very convenient.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|NQq8i7gsaa	definently itouch if your looking for more than just something to play music, it can have hundred of apps and even texting, so if your looking for a multipurpose mp3 player and whatnot the itouch is worth it.

I am also a the most CLUMSY person on earth and dropped it a few times and never had any problems except for maybe the corner paint scratching. the dares virtual QWERTY keyboard is amazing and i loved it. the dare has amazing features also. it has a txting feature where u can write it and it will change it to txt. pretty neat. but if you arnt alredy wiht verizon i would check tmobile service in ur area and if its decent get the G1. I have it currently and its awsome definatly a iphone killer.  hope i helped! email me if u have questions

It was amazing except that the touch screen did suck.<br>  <br>  they recalled it because it is capable of "catching fire". you can look it up in the reports. so now they don't sell it and many of us need a new phone. <br>  <br>  i really don't want to give it up... but i have to<br>  <br>  but if it makes you feel better, there are a lot of glitches. as with all phones, the first version isn't perfect. i know that this would would have broken in the matter of six months. my sister has already been through two. <br>  <br>  i suggest the lg incite or the propel|`|nKL7v9vbaa	My stepfather works for AT&T, and he informed me that there has been a recall on all Quickfire phones and that the company sent all direct sellers e-mails saying to "Immediately remove devices from shelves." I, myself, own the Quickfire and it's not the best phone I've had. Lately I have noticed a lagging problem and see myself having to double touch the screen in order for it to go. I told him, though, that I am not giving my phone back unless I have a legit reason. <br>  <br>  Anyways, one of the reasons for the recall is that this phone can be charged wrong, and negative effects can happen, such as implodes, apparently. Full reasons are not exactly explained. But, this is a nationwide thing.|`|e85803bf0a191397e1f247ae39618449aa	It has been reported that  AT&T Quickfire has been pulled off the shelves, sales have been halted, due to what AT&T is calling "quality issues". However it is still available online and the blogosphere is ablaze with rumors and puns. "The AT&T Quickfire was quick to crash and burn."<br>  <br>  The AT&T Quickfire was launched late last year as a messaging phone with a touchscreen.|`|mwhPcaYxaa	they recalled the phone because people don't know which way to charge their phones!<br>  <br>  I'm really upset about this, my husband was going to buy it for me this morning and they were gone!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I don't know what phone to get now, i think im going to stick with my razr until the quickfire comes back. if it ever does|`|UJZPNHpFaa	I saw that too....they took off alot of phones. Maybe they're just fixing something? I don't know keep checking!|`|AA10425912	AT&T has made a recall on the Quickfire because of reports of the device overheating when the charger was inserted the wrong way. Although it may seem like a consumer error, developers should create devices that only allow the chargers to be inserted one way, and one way only.<br>  <br>  They made a formal warning of this overheating hazard with the Quickfire and have made a cease of all sales of the Quickfire, although a reason for the cease of selling the Quickfire has not been made clear yet.<br>  <br>  As far as the other phones I find the LG Vu surprisingly cheap feeling as the case is made with plastic, unlike its Verizon and European counterparts, the Dare and the Prada. I would go with the Samsung Eternity, although it lacks Wi-Fi and voice-dialing. Technically the Eternity is not a smartphone, as with the Vu, but I find overall the Eternity is a better phone.|`|gaTVhsleaa	Be happy that AT&T did this.  I have had the Quickfire since only Christmas and the problems with it are ongoing.  <br>  <br>  The major purpose of the recall was due to its susceptibility to catching fire if charge the wrong way, but personally, that was the least of problems I encountered.<br>  <br>  The phones touch screen is hypersensitive at times, and other times it won‚Äôt detect anything.  It usually freezes and needs restarted.<br>  <br>  The battery life after hours of charging still is only about three days or so.<br>  <br>  My biggest issue with the phone though is the actual slider itself.  The panel on both of my phones (I had the one replaced after only two weeks) became so loose that every time you touch it, it makes a creaking noise.  This is EXTREMELY annoying when having a phone conversation with someone and constantly hearing this in the back of your head.<br>  <br>  Additionally, I recently began receiving text messages that were flooded with weird symbols (somewhat like windings) throughout the entire message, and at times, some new text messages would actually have sentences from old text messages inserted into them.<br>  <br>  This is the biggest disappointment I have ever had with AT&T and am hoping they can resolve this.  I def. do not want another one of these phones, and I am happy that they removed it and saved all of you from the torture its put me through.|`|tldey7Jnaa	its been recalled because it really really sucks!!!!!! it freezes! it has a poor battery life. But the main reason is because it can overheat and cause it to explode( right now they are blaming it on being pluged in wrong but the guy at att told me not to charge it!) any why for all you looking for a touch screen phone either get the eternity or wait a little while cause i heard there may be a phone similar to the quickfire but better coming out soon.|`|nvTqKZQGaa	Look the reason the quick fire is no longer on the site is that there are some issues with people plugging in the charger incorrectly and the phone is wanting to over heat. AT&T doesn't want anyone to have a device that doesn't meet the proper standards of operation. As soon as the issue has been correct they will be placing the quickfire back on sale.|`|WtCUYr1caa	i saw it on phonedog.com that there had been a nationwide recall<br>  apparently, people were plugging their charger in the exact opposite way its supposed to and it overheats and catches fire<br>  i went to the att store yesterday and asked what happened, the salesman told me the same thing. i also asked when it would be back<br>  the guy said the company just announced the recall on monday and tuesday and they were all pulled back. he had no idea when it would be back on the market and then proceeded to say good riddance because the phone wasnt good at all. i really wanted that phone but when the salesman actually says the phone was a piece of crap, i guess ppl shouldnt buy it, or figure out how to charge it first|`|goNkObn9aa	OK...here's the scoop... <br>  I have the quickfire cellfoen.. it works perfectly the one i have but who knows right? AT&T is ordering a recall on the Sidekick like Quickfire cell phone after it was found out that if the recharger is plugged in the wrong way, the Quickfire begins overheating which in a worse case scenario could lead to the thing exploding. <br>                                Hope the fix the problem|`|zJlpRZO3aa	There has been a recall on all Quickfires! :( I'm extremely upset because I was literally going to buy this phone next week for my birthday and now I can't.

ohq6qrFaaa	I think really it depends on the Audio Source. For example, a Cowon D2 can go louder than a Creative Zen. If you want loud volumes (which would damage your ears) then get a player with a strong amp, and buy a headphone amp and connect the two. This allows more power to be output to the earphones, increasing the volume. <br>  <br>  If you want loud music to hear it in loud areas, buy some noise cancelling in ear canal earphones, like Sennheiser CX300 or Creative Ep-630|`|0Ru9smefaa	Zune's PREMIUM earphones.<br>  <br>  They are very good.

edzU8VJiaa	No, it's because LG TVs have a reputation for poor picture quality.  Any LCD or Plasma TV will have somewhat poorer-quality pictures than your old set, unless you are watching HD, but some are much better than others.<br>  <br>  Before we bought our new 46" LCD TV, we thoroughly researched the Internet review sites/forums to find the best deal/quality; Sony came out tops, but was hugely expensive, and was followed closely by JVC (which is what we bought because we got a really great deal).  LG was slated badly on every site (and we looked at lots).  Some other brands of TVs have LG technology, too, so are just LGs under a different name.<br>  <br>  The reason they look good in the shops is because they are often running on an HD loop and not the standard programmes others in the shop are showing, and this gives a false impression of the general picture quality.|`|a91fdc98672c951bb2b3dbcd91d1b581aa	Granny is right should have done some more research there is a reason LG tv's always go on sale they are junk.  Simply look at these manufacturers.  It appears you are budget minded so mentioning Pioneer for the best Plasma is mundane.  Panasonic if you want plasma.  Now for LCD you have 4 I would highly recommend Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and in that order Samsung has the best LCD on the market by FAR!|`|Wf9FrzAJaa	I'd say you have something wrong with your reception, or your tv, or you're just seeing the difference between analogue and digital. My LG6000 37" is a brilliant picture - can't fault it.<br>  <br>  Don't forget that some things can look worse on digital than a good quality analogue - particularly fast action such as football here the picture can be a bit 'blocky'.<br>  <br>  However, your LG set also lets you select analogue channels, so you may find these better.<br>  <br>  If it still looks wrong, and you've adjusted all the options in the picture set-up, you may want to talk to the shop from where you bought it as it could be faulty. Hope you get it sorted :-)|`|FgTkF31iaa	yes
E02Tjv7naa	iPods DO NOT suck, and the answer to your question is most likely 1 of 3 things.<br>  1. how long is your backlight setting on? the backlight (when it's all bright) eats your battery really fast. I had that problem<br>  <br>  2. You said that you play games. Do you do them a lot? same as the backlight, although that eats more. that's not to say stop playing them, they are fun, but don't play them as often.  <br>  <br>  3. do you leave your iPod on when you are done with it? even if hte backlight is off, the dull light is on, and that slowly but surely takes away the battery.<br>  <br>  so, hopefully one of these is your problem, and i hope it helped!|`|VVqGQfJYaa	its broken!<br>  get a new one - possibly not an ipod, how about a zune?|`|oyljTnxPaa	Try lowering your brightness and volume and see how that works<br>  If you're doing multiple things at once (IE Listening to music while browsing photos) it will kill your battery much faster<br>  If that doesn't work, take it to apple and they can run a diagnostic and they will repair it if it's faulty|`|xXDkTJcWaa	This has been happening a lot for these users. Apple has a phone number you have for that. You can bring it it and they will give u a refund or fix your battery. The number is 1-800-MY-APPLE. Tell them this problem and they will fix it. IF u don't want to do that then just keep charging it, but your battery may be messed up.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  ~Jen|`|oUcvAXmaaa	My ipod usually lasts 3-4 hours. Either..you should get a portable charger because your computer is not giving it enough enery or you should complain and ask for a new ipod.<br>  I hope i helped!<br>  Good luck with everything!|`|LxoBEO5Paa	ipods suck. tada|`|rGupsyAtaa	ok for 1 you should turn off the brightness and turn off the clicking noise. 2 if you charge it for more then you should charge it then it will die much quicker. even though it says you should charge it for 3 hours you should check it every once in a while in those 3 hours and see if the charged icon is on it or after three hours if it really is charged. games take more energy then music and so do movies. my ipod classic takes like 1 hour or sometimes 1 hour 30 minutes. lastly if your using a lot of memory on your ipod like 90 % of it it will die much quicker|`|LjACB6nsaa	if you have the backlight on all the time turn it off, otherwise it is probably faulty. good luck getting apple to replace it.

3CJAUyqPaa	What do you mean by "used universally"?<br>  <br>  Not all video editors can deal with AVCHD compression - but a BluRay Player can play it.<br>  <br>  Not all video editors can deal with a.AVI file - but most Windows based editors can - not MovieMaker, though.<br>  <br>  Not all video editors can deal with .mov files - but Macs can...<br>  <br>  There is no "universal".<br>  <br>  Check the FAQ at vimeo.com for high definition video for their site - and YouTube. h.264 and 720p works great. It is a very easy change to make that a 1080i video... or if you want a standard definition file, an MP4 works...

Xg2WuQ0uaa	They do, but nothing high profile. The truth is that most of the games released on the PS2 now are going to be bad. They are made by developers that don't have the resources or skill to make games for next gen consoles (most of the time). <br>  <br>  Sometimes you'll see a late import from Asia that was translated, like Yakuza 2, or Persona 4 (both of which are supposedly very good). <br>  <br>  Just this week Totally Spies: Totally Party, and Trivial Pursuit (also on PS3/Xbox360) are being released. I wouldn't expect any of them to get good reviews...<br>  <br>  You'll see some PS2 versions of next gen games (Mercenaries 2 for example), but they are usually poorly made as most of the effort goes into making the 360/PS3 versions (for example...Mercenaries 2, which looked and played worse than the original Mercenaries).|`|pl2SocVKaa	yeah they do but they are starting to decline|`|pOi0wewIaa	Yes of course but they get less and less games as this year comes by.|`|JZMfUDylaa	not news ones no they go out for the PS3 but if your talking about the ps2 games that have already been out like Final Fantasy 10 then I don't think so but people get sick of those games and sell them on EBay or bring them to a game shop to be sold.

Unless you have money to burn. <br>  <br>  Facts.1. Plasma has a better picture than LCD.<br>            2.Plasma has faster refresh rate,than LCD (no Lag)<br>            3.Burn in no longer an issue for Plasma<br>            4. Wider viewing angle than LCD. <br>            5. Lower Cost<br>            6. They do use more energy.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled, with 1080P Hype, On a 42" and under, your eyes cant tell the difference between 720P & 1080P unless you are sitting within 5.5 ft. from the screen. On 46" and higher its 8.6ft.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled with 120Hz on LCD. Fact is a Plasma playing @60hz still has a faster refresh rate than a 120Hz LCD. Therefore any fast action(i.e. gaming, sports, action films) will be smooth. <br>  <br>  Plasmas now has equal lifespans as LCD, this one (PN42A400) boasts a 100,000hr life. <br>  <br>  Plasmas have a higher contrast ratio (Blacker blacks & Whiter whites)<br>  <br>  New Plasmas DO NOT have to worry about "burn-in"<br>  <br>  Finally, I researched these to death, after I did I ran back to Kmart, yeah, Kmart to get my 42" Samsung. $699.99  That saved me $1000.00 and looks every bit as good if not better than the 120Hz LCD I thought I wanted.|`|tapjeN7xaa	Go to bestbuy and ask them to let you demo your most video intensive game on each of them, that way you can compare them.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	For gaming I would recommend LCD that not burn-in,less power consumption and last longer.I suggest Samsung LN46A650 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color with Sports and Game modes boost on-screen performance and interaction with the latest gaming systems <br>  50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio<br>  Blazing 4ms response time<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413D94?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001413D94" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...</a>|`|5apGkgS9aa	well a palsma uses a lot of electricty (my bf a tv engineer) so either really get the best quality hd you can afford panasonic are a good bet
j5Apt8hWaa	EF-S lenses are those designed only for use on Canon entry and bridge level cameras using the APS-C sensor ... they cannot be used on Canon 1D, 5D or EOS 35 mm Canon bodies.<br>  <br>  18-55 is a wide angle to medium telephoto lens<br>  The 75-300 mm is a standard telephoto to long telephoto lens you can use for shooting wildlife and sports.<br>  The 55-250 mm is a medium telephoto to medium long telephoto lens, used more for shooting sports, but can be used to shoot wildlife as well.  Just remember that the longer the lens, the further the subject can be from your camera and still fill the cameras frame.<br>  <br>  <br>  Link to what focal lengths look like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tamron.com/lenses/learning_center/tools/focal-length-comparison.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tamron.com/lenses/learning_ce...</a>|`|7t4p5TyHaa	Well the greater the number, the greater the zoom will be. You may think sure, this number is higher therefore it is a better lens, but it might not help when you're in close situations; it might be too close to focus correctly.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd go for the 18-55 and 55-250 instead of the 75-300 so you won't have the gap between 55 of the first lens and 75 of the second. <br>  <br>  It really all depends on what you're photographing, make your decision from that.|`|KYAOIO7paa	Yes, they are all lenses, Canon EF-S series lens. Chose second option (18-55mm IS + 55-250mm IS). The second lens has Image Stabilizer(IS), Its all Canon set... before you buy check price... But more important to know your purpose... why you r buying a DSLR? what is your main motivation to buy, as a first buyer this package is good one. but never buy too many.. unless you know how to exploit them... good luck|`|WOiH4CGvaa	I would suggest not getting a two EF-S lens system, just get the one "kit" lens. <br>  <br>  Honestly the only EF-S lens worth buying, if you go with the Rebel or 30,40, 50, 60D series, is the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM, because there is no EF lens to take its place. <br>  <br>  Sounds silly, but if you stick to photography, the camera bodies, become "legacy" far quicker than the lens's do. <br>  <br>  You would be much better of buying EF lens's that will fit on all Canon bodies, than, the EF-S's that only work on the Rebel and the 30, etc. D series.
EzWtyaVLaa	you wont be able to for flex pay because t-mobile charges $30-$35 a month for their service (not talking about minutes) just to make the phone function. this goes for smartphones too.|`|P5rfNdFEaa	You need the Sidekick data plan so you would need a monthly plan.|`|d550e5dab8e088e0b1d9c88397b744faaa	I would suggest the Pre-Paid Sidekick plan. As a 15 year old, I find that it is a very good plan. Plan on bringing your I.D., Credit Card & that's about it. It should cost about $30.00 or close. They will give you a Pre-Paid Sim Card, it also should come w/ some money on your account. Either $15 or $30 w/ your SIM card purchase. Just ask for the Sidekick Pre-Paid Plan, a $1.00/day for Web/IM/Txt & $00.15 or $00.10/ Minute. But I highly suggest getting that plan.
j5Apt8hWaa	It is called formating ... once all your images are copied safely to your computer, use the format feature on your camera to format the card.<br>  <br>  That will refresh the card and write new file folders and a new image index file to your card ... ready to start shooting new images without the worry of corrupting the card, which deleting individual files can do.
2nXrQhkeaa	Eh, I think it just estimates the amount of battery differently. :D
VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels‚Ä¶. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Personally I prefer Sony.Try Sony Cybershot DSCW130 8.1MP with 4x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013TUG5G?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013TUG5G" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013TU...</a><br>  or more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D330405011%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fp%255F4%255F1%26bbn%3D330405011%26qid%3D1236643929%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A502394%252Cn%253A281052%252Cn%253A330405011%252Cp%255F4%253ASony&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|vumO06qFaa	I recommend Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011ZCDKS?ie=UTF8&tag=yahanswer-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0011ZCDKS" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011ZC...</a><br>  <br>  affordable price &Bestseller #1on Amazon.

Yxt6SzSuaa	I'd go with the Nokia. I know most people are gonna say you should buy the iPhone, but really, the iPhone ain't that great. Ppl just got sucked in by Apple's marketing campaign.

Mboh3eVCaa	The jailbreak with the 2nd gen ipod touch is not pretty at this point, I would recommend you wait until something a little better comes out.  The 2nd gen requires a different method than the other ipod/iphones and a jailbreak is basically still being developed.  The link the other guy posted is not going to work, and there's a good chance you'll just brick your ipod doing that.  You can go to <a href="http://redsn0w.com/" rel="nofollow">http://redsn0w.com/</a> or <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.iphone-dev.org/</a> to keep up with progress on the jailbreak, or to try the tethered methods.  These are the people that develop the hacks in the first place and the other people rip off later...|`|LczVFrzuaa	Unrar/Unzip it, and double click the "Cyw00d Jailbreak Helper.exe".<br>  <br>  SKIP STEP TWO, The Hacked .IPSW is already included in the folder.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=TB2N71ON" rel="nofollow">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=TB2N71ON</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Mark S. said I would probably rip you off with this program. It is just a GUI for redsn0w install, plus there is no real way to "Brick" your iPod since you have recovery menu's that nobody can access unless you rip the iPod apart and take the flash 3 memory out. Please, don't post unless you know what your talking about. Your confusing people.
3BO2mFZ1aa	hmmm, not really.  I can only think of one instance of where the game earns it's mature rating, where Lachance gets punished by the brotherhood.  Other than that its a pure fantasy game.  Sure the zombies and skells are realistic looking, and theres plenty of blood, but nothing to be having nightmares about.|`|7jyUI4EMaa	Oblivion is one of the best rpgs out there. ive never seen any bad reviews.|`|wrzUD1rMaa	Oblivion is really good. If you really like morrowind, it can be good or bad, depending on your opinon. There are major differences in oblivion and morrowind. There are not as many types of weapons, and there is no levitation in Oblivion, for example.<br>  But that doesn't mean at all that Oblivion isn't a good game though. Things like gameplay and visuals are awesome, and the personalities of the NPCs are amusing. Getting the expansions (Shivering Isles and Nights of the Nine) make the game longer and better. So I would recommend the Game of the Year Edition.<br>  On the black 360 Elite it hasn't glitched yet but it did on a white 360.

Select "Delete thread" and all messages to and from that person will be deleted.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, there is no way to delete one specific message without deleting the entire thread.

In the movie "Play Misty for Me" they showed a telephone with a valid telephone number on it, as the woman harassing Clint Eastwood dialed part of his number.  In most exchanges that number is not used any more due to the harassing calls to that number.<br>  So in all movies and television shows they use an area code followed by 555 and then any four digits, which will take you to directory assistance, for that area code, and your calling number will be displayed.

Granted, it's 1080p, but I have seen mounds of evidence/data which suggest the human eye can't even tell the difference.<br>  <br>  You have buyer's remorse.  I did too after my purchase.  You have a good TV that you bought at a good price.  Rest assured you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  P.S. Disregard what that person said about the reliability of plasma.  I honestly don't know where these morons get their information.  Plasmas are every bit as reliable as LCDs.|`|a91fdc98672c951bb2b3dbcd91d1b581aa	You did well with going for the Sansung but really threw your money down the toilet should have paid the extra for a 1080p.  Give it a few more years and DVD will be obsolete and Bluray will take over that is the one true format to view 1080p anyways if your not a movie guy fine a 720p will be fine for sports and HD viewing is only 720p anyways.  <br>  Enjoy your 720p.|`|AA10788612	That price is about average. But in order to take full advantage of Blu-ray & digital cable, you should have spent a little more & got a 1080p TV. Plasma tvs have not proved themselves to me to be a reliable as everyone thinks. Honestly, I don't expect you to get but a couple of years of use out of yours.|`|f8592bb83b6aa1529c793905ed478ce3aa	Unless you are right up with your nose on the screen it is going to be hard to tell the difference between 720 and 1080. I would have done the same and switched to the bigger one.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Did you look at the pictures of the two sets before buying the Samsung? If so and you thought the picture was as good as or better than the Sharp, then you made the right choice. If you also looked at the 1080p version of the Samsung and didn't think the picture improvement was worth the extra money, then you did the right thing there, too.<br>  <br>  But, if you just bought the Samsung 720p without looking at any other TVs and just took the salesman's word for it that the Samsung 720p was better for the price, then who knows if you did the right thing? Maybe the salesman was right. But, maybe he got a bigger commission on the Samsung.<br>  <br>  I once asked the owner of a vineyard what was the best wine on the market. He replied with a straight face, "Whatever you like the best." My point is that wine, stereo speakers, and TVs are the kinds of things that people have particular preferences for. And, the cost of the item can be a factor in what you ultimately purchase. But, you can't say that one TV is a better deal than another unless you have actually looked at the TVs and compared performance versus price.

Making the film produced a rather toxic waste stream and at over $1 a photo, digital cameras have become much more popular.
VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels‚Ä¶. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|14512ce63e83e4e4a2a4411804cb548faa	Sony Cybershot cameras are really cool. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665495060" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a><br>  This one has 10 Mega pixels, a rechargeable battery, and a huge 3 inch touch screen on the back of the camera.

You can take hundreds of photos with the Lithiums.  You will be much happier than with the rechargeables.<br>  <br>  Good luck in you search.<br>  <br>  Anna|`|1jFG5h1iaa	Smart, and fast 10 megapixel camera with the smallest body in the world for its class.

(Also seen on TV on Ashton commercials)|`|Eh0R7IjGaa	For quality cameras, you have to go Nikon.<br>  All professionals use Nikons, and they're great. They have superb quality, great battery life, and good zoom. You can get professional style, or more compact ones, if that's what you want.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for good battery quality/life, don't even think about Canon. In my experience, they're batteries are terrible. I've never had a Canon product that has kept a charge for more then a couple of hours. You should always remember, if you use a Canon product, to bring spare batteries with you.<br>  <br>  At the person who is against rechargeable batteries: what the hell are you on about?

So you're going to have to settle on something less than perfect.  :-)<br>  <br>  You several choices to make here.  The first is whether you want to buy bundled (aka HTIB) or piece by piece.  Home theater in a box options are easier, but you frequently sacrifice  sound quality and connection/expansion options when you go this route.  However, doing it yourself can get a bit pricey.<br>  <br>  Remember, you will need a Blu-ray player, a receiver, speaker cables, perhaps speaker connectors, HDMI cables for your components, speaker stands, and of course the speakers themselves.  An HTIB only takes care of the speakers and the receiver, so budget accordingly.<br>  <br>  As far as speakers go, you'll get the best sound if you buy individual speakers.  I bought a 5.1 Polk Audio set for under $300 simply because I didn't have the cash to go all out, but you can literally spend as much as you want on speakers.<br>  <br>  For HTIB I say you go with the Onkyo HT-S6100.  If you're going to DIY, then stick with Onkyo receivers because although they may not be the best, they are the best value.  The TX-SR606 is a good one.  Polk and Klipsch make some good, affordable speaker bundles.<br>  <br>  For a Blu-ray player I say you buy a PS3.

Dfr6uA91aa	A TI-89 Titanium emulator on the TI-84+ SE? There are a few things that need clearing up. (Furthermore, what will switching the case do?)<br>  <br>  First of all, do you mean you want the emulator on your calculator so your TI-84+ can act like a TI-89? Or do you want a TI-89 emulator on your computer so you can use it as if you were using a TI-84+?<br>  <br>  To answer the first question, there are currently no available emulators for the TI-84+ that support the TI-89. The only on-calc emulator available, Emu8x ( <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/13/132/132629.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/arti...</a> ) can only support emulations up to the TI-86. <br>  Also, I doubt there will be an emulator for TI-89, because those two calculators run on completely different architectures. The TI-84+ uses the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, while the TI-89 has the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It's kind of like running Mac OS X (non-Intel version) on a PC.<br>  <br>  If it was the second question, then an emulator like VTI68K can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/74/7484.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fil...</a><br>  <br>  Note however in both cases you'll need a valid ROM image for the TI-89 in order for the emulator to run correctly (or at all). In order to obtain a ROM image, you'll need to get it from your own calculator, meaning you'll need to legally own it first. Also, the distribution of ROMs is not legal. So the only way you'd be able to get a free ROM image is to download it illegally.|`|v8INGQ6taa	the 89

xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player. The easiest way is to burn the music to an audio CD and then rip it back to Windows Media Player or a similar program as an MP3. Or you can get some software to help you. I use TuneClone to do this. Though not free, it is very well worth a try.<br>  <br>  Below is its step by step tutorial about how to get iTunes 8 music converted to MP3:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-mp3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-...</a>

ThRPAGDyaa	Unfortunately this means there was water in your iPod. There was probably a chance that the water would dry and the iPod would go back to normal but now that there was some burning going on, if the iPod isn't working you've probably thoroughly destroyed it. You could try and send it into apple for a repair but most likely they'll send it back saying that you've broken the warranty by causing water/fire damage. If there are iPod repair shops in your area, you might try those, but at this point you'll probably have to find another iPod. :-( sorry, I myself would be beyond distraught.|`|ZYwTrAp8aa	put in in a container filled with rice for 24 hours..then try it again

dduWesM5aa	Definitely the Esp ec 1000. i own a schecter tempest custom, and it's a great guitar, but the stock pickups aren't heavy enough for me. i believe the Tempest Classic has Seymour Duncan sh-11 pickups, which are probably going to do the job for TDWP kind of metal (metalcore). but i would advise you to get the esp, because it's all together a better guitar, and the emg 81 and 60 set is going to be heavier than the duncans on the Schecter.
0tJx6OZraa	If the wireless connection asks you for a password that mean that this wifi connection is restricted. This means that this a home owned wifi connection and they do not want anyone else on the network. If this is your own router then who ever set up the router must have put in a password so ask them for the password. If this is connection from optimum wifi then you have to have an optimum account to go on optimum wifi.

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	At 19", a normal Progressive Scan DVD player should look awesome.<br>  <br>  When you say HD cables, are you referring to component cable or HDMI cable?  Component cables are 3 for video (Red, Green, Blue) and 2 for audio (Red and White).  If you are not using either HDMI or component cables, you are not getting an HD picture, or even Progressive scan quality out of your DVD player.<br>  <br>  Next, on your Fiber optic cable box, are you watching the HD channels?  The ones that actually read like ABCHD, ESPNHD, etc.  If not, then those are the standard tv broadcasts you are watching, not the HD broadcasts.  And by the way, you need HDMI or component cables from the cable box to the TV for this as well.|`|xnsoQzInaa	yes you need an hd dvd player and you need to use the high def cables.

Even if you switch back to att it will not work. <br>  <br>  Only an apple technician would be able to fix it but after unlocking it you lose the warranty so they will not fix it for free.
