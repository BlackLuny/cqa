443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	<----My love in life...golden retriever.<br>  <br>  Hi Cassie.....this upsets me so much, and my first inner thought is to yell at her because it hurts so bad to read her stupidity.  Okay, with that being said.  I adore YOU for trying to knock some sense into her.  Thank you so much!!<br>  <br>  Give her everything you know, printouts are best because if she won't listen to you "verbally", at least you will have given her paperwork to keep....whether she reads it or throws it away.  I suggest printouts on genetic problems, breeding too close, the info on HIPS/eyes/heart testing, allergies, and cancer.  Additionally, explain the problems involved in breeding.....birth problems, costs to care for those puppies, the overpopulation and how these (hurts me to know this) poor babies could go to families that won't care for them or wind up in shelters!!  Ugh, upset now....sorry!!    AND..........<br>  <br>  Do you mean to tell me that this poor goldie is TIED TO A TREE??   I'm pissed now!  And, I never even come close to saying words like that.  Okay....calm down.   BETTER YET...........show her my message!!!  Yes, please do.   In fact, show her everyones message of quality reading here!!!  <br>  <br>  Take her to a shelter, take her to a pound, give her books to read on specific topics of unsafe breeding and genetics.  Explain that when dogs are neutered their chances of getting cancer are less.  <br>  <br>  Explain the issue of "parvo" also.  If she keeps her golden outside (which is my biggest pet peeve....Read my message under my Avatar when you have the chance), there are more chances for them to get sick, an illness, parvo, or approached by other animals/prey.....that could possibly kill them.  <br>  <br>  GOLDENS are people dogs.....they don't like being away from humans, EVER!!!  They like to live with their humans, and not outside and away from them....!!  Tell her this!<br>  <br>  Continue to explain that this should be left to Professional Breeders and not BYB's like herself, and they work to better the breed, and their parents should always come from quality parents from Champion lines.  Professional Breeders ALWAYS aim to BETTER the breed, not just breed for the sake of $$, pleasure, and the fun of puppies.  There is a commitment involved here in so many ways.....not only the quality of puppies/parents, but also the doctors appointments, food, safety & protecting, cleaning the whelping area several times a day, the mother must be cared for, shots, and it's a full time commitment!!  Someone must be there to care for them 24/7!!<br>  <br>  Oh, whatever you do, please don't give up on this.....she doesn't know what she is doing, nor does she have the "qualifications" to breed from what you said.  She's doing this for the wrong reasons.<br>  <br>  FINALLY.......if their last dog got hit by a car, then they surely should not breed NOR should they have another dog!  That is ill responsible!!  They are not qualified, trained, nor are they looking at all the problems that will arise from this.<br>  <br>  I sure wish you well.......you go girl!!!   Don't stop what you know is "right"!!   Thank you!!!|`|eDySIDPQaa	It won't work, it will just make her want to get a dog even more..<br>  <br>  You have done all you can do, you have educated them and they do not want to listen.<br>  <br>  the best thing you can at this Point, is to sneak over to their house, and get that poor dog untied from the tree....<br>  <br>  it is not fair to the dog at all....<br>  <br>  Have you at least told them no dog should be bred till 2 yrs old, they are not mature till this age.<br>  <br>  Cassie, all you can do it keep educating, if they won't listen, there is not much you can do about it at all.<br>  <br>  Sorry, this is sounds like a real BYB is about to be born yet again..|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Do you think taking her to visit a shelter will work?

Fortunately we live in a free country, unfortunately sometimes this means that ignorant people do stupid things.  <br>  <br>  It is apparent that your aunt thinks she is going to make money off of these puppies.  You are not going to change her mind on the moral grounds.  But perhaps you can on the economic grounds.  Talk to her and maybe show her some proof of the downturn in dog sales.  That she will most likely end up not being able to sell the pups because in this down economy, people are not buying, in fact people are turning their dogs into shelters because they can't afford the ones that they already have.  She will then be stuck with up to 8 to 15 pups to care for.  Goldens have a tendency toward larger litters.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry that the poor dog is tied to a tree.  No dog should have to live like that.  Are their laws in your area regarding tying up dogs?  If so, you can report them.

m4uDn0ofaa	How do you know they were not fleas?  From your discription it sounds dead on to fleas along with the water turing blood red after they were in there.  It is possible that what you saw was the "flea dirt" that is left when fleas poop.  It's basically dried blood.  I would listen to what your vet.  It is a good thing you put your dog on medication for fleas and ticks, because there is a very small chance it could have been ticks.  Good luck and your puppy should improve soon.|`|3ln7uT3Haa	yeah like the guy above said, definitely ticks hey.

6SeWCfUfaa	It doesn't sound to me like they were fighting with each other.  It sounds to me like your G. Shep is protecting you.<br>  <br>  The chi was acting aggressively towards you and the G. Shep wasn't going to allow that.  This is not uncommon pack behavior.  And especially not with GSD's.  There will often be a dog within the pack that will not allow the other dogs to confront the pack leader.  To think of it this way, the dogs don't allow leapfrogging in the pecking order.  The G. Shep see's you as the pack leader, see's the chi as under him and isn't about to allow a confrontation between you and the chi.  In the G. Sheps mind, the chi would have to outrank it, before it should be allowed to challenge you.<br>  <br>  Does that make a little more sense now?<br>  <br>  The chi was out of line.  Growling at you was out of line.  Period.  My guess is that the chi is a typical spoiled chi that has probably been babied and gets away with a lot when it comes to you.  You're going to have to address that dogs behavior and make sure it never challenges you again.  <br>  <br>  That means, stop playing dress up with your chi and start treating it like a dog.  Or you will contine to have problems.  The G. Shep is not going to tolerate it if the chi continues to behave that way towards you and in a real fight, guess who's gonna win and guess who's gonna become lunch.|`|IS4ND9Sjaa	if they both are males and not fixed that could be the reason. most dogs fight for the alpha dog and wont stop to they get it. a chihuahua doesn't know it's so little and doesn't have enough sense to be afraid of a big dog. you may have to keep them away from one another if it continues or you might end up with only one dog so say. best of luck to you.|`|33PwXUblaa	Dominance may be one reason why they fight!<br>  A bucket of water or a hose can help you in this situation!<br>  NEVER GET IN TO "help"!|`|hjxIm8RWaa	I don't know why they might have been fighting, sometimes even dogs that are friends have fights, maybe your german shepard was trying to become the dominant dog, or else they were fighting over some food.

I would try yelling loudly at them, because you are the boss of the dogs, if they dont listen, I would turn the hose on and spray them with it, they wont like it and will stop fighting. If you are inside use a spray bottle with the nozzle loose so that the stream is sharp and spray that on them. Good luck with your problem, I hope your dogs dont fight any more.|`|Wt1pZpANaa	well if there both males its because one has to be the alfa male and honesly my dogs use to do the samething and the best thing is to keep them a ways from each other|`|hf93gjK9aa	I tried that once and got bit. I had a dachshund for a few years then got another dachshund. They were both females and constantly fought. I talk to the vet and he said they are trying to declare dominance. That summer I started back to school and stayed gone most of the day, because of me not being around they were forced to get along. Without even realizing that helped and they never had anymore problems. <br>  <br>  I noticed you said that your Chihuahua is a boy is your German Shepard a boy also? How long have you had the two together? Maybe the German Shepard felt the need to protect you. Every now and then one of my dachshunds will get a little sassy when I take her sweater off. <br>  <br>  Instead of trying to pull them off of each other, find something that makes aloud noise that will distract them. I would ring the door bell or I had this big bouncy ball that I would lightly toss at them. Some people would spray them with the water hose if they are outside. Good Luck|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I am guessing from the description that the chihuahua has been dominant over the shepherd, since the little one is two and the big one is one.  Now the older dog is feeling threatened by the younger one.  I am glad they have their shots.  Did they cut each other?  I wouldn't worry until they hurt each other.  I have a Jack Russell that will attack the larger dog if it sneezes. The other dog will raise his head and move away when this happens. I have to catch the small dog.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, your dogs will work through this by the end of a month or two, maybe even less time.  Are they neutered?  <br>  That will always help. Male dogs that are intact will be much more prone to fight.  <br>  <br>  Has your chihuahua ever growled or acted aggressive before?  Little dogs seem to get more agitated more easily.  <br>  <br>  I have used this site to help me understand and work with my dogs better:<br>  <a href="http://www.aggressivebehaviorsindogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aggressivebehaviorsindogs.com...</a><br>  The Yahoo Group called AgBeh is good, too. You need to follow the rules there, but going back and looking at the "sucess stories" is very helpful.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	when ever you hvae two dogs fight you get the water hose or bucket of water and throw it on them it shoudl make them stop. that is sad. if the chihuahua was mine he wouldn't have bit no one. I had one and if you teach them young they wont' bite i have a yorkie who was brought up with one of your dogs and i darn either of them to bite you have to be very firm twith them and nearly choke them at first while they are young and go after them you dont' hurt them scare them and i guarantee they wont' bite. but the best thing fighting hose and water. it will stop them immediately.

zzzd9tC4aa	I like the idea of a waterfall, but these are bearded dragon's not water dragons. I don't mean to sound sarcastic, but in the wild backs of Australia, beardies wont really encounter many waterfalls! A normal water dish will be fine. However beardies don't often drink from a bowl, unless you train them-which can be done. They absorb water through their skin to keep themselves hydrated, so once or twice a week you should give your dragon a little bath, luke warm, so he can bathe and absorb water-(this also helps with shedding). If you drip water onto your beardies snout, it will drip over his mouth and he should instinctively drink it. <br>  <br>  In answer to your first question, chlorinated water should be fine, it won't harm them. Also you can spray his salad with water, so that when he eats, he takes in water as well. But remember not to let your tank get too humid, this can cause fungal infections in damp areas-nasty.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Just a few thought for you. Lettuce? As in salad lettuce is bad for dragons, do not use if this is what you are talking about. Also you need a UVB light to run the length of his enclosure. Get a digital probe thermometer so you can check the temps and get them to the proper degrees.<br>  Waterfall? I worry about it providing too much humidity in the tank. Remember these are desert reptiles. Just a simple water dish would be fine but you gotta watch that humidity. Please rethink this. <br>  Why don't you go to beardeddragons.org and go in the forums and look at some of the enclosures. You might get some good ideas that will work for you and the dragon.|`|jDPULfjKaa	it's fine when the chlorine evaporates in 24 hours.

692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	They both smell.   Rats are the cleaner breed however, they cant stand to be dirty.  Rats can learn their name, and can also play simple games like fetch or hide and seek.  They can learn simple commands like sit, or fetch... also no.. really any command you take the time to teach they can learn.  They are very intellegent animals, and very loyal.  You can also litter box train them.  They will sit on your shoulder and watch TV with you, they are often compared to dogs when it comes to personality.  They are a much better choice when it comes to companionship animals.  But their life span is shorter, and they can get health problems like colds or tumors.  Since rat owners often get very attached to their dog like personalitites it is harder when they die.   I think rats are very adorable, however guinea pigs would win in a cute contest lol'<br>  <br>  But any how i chose rats!|`|N8HgRKnfaa	Guinea pig, def!<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs have more personality--and quite a lot.

They love carrots too.<br>  <br>  They're gentle to play with, don't usually bite, and are oh, sooo cute! We would sometimes put ours out in the yard in a cage with no bottom and he would delightedly munch the fresh green grass in the shade all afternoon.<br>  <br>  There's quite a variety of breeds to choose from and I believe they live longer lives than rats. I've never had a rat so I can't speak for or against them, but if you want a fun companion, get a delightful baby guinea pig!|`|wHtvhkMiaa	umm i dont like gunni pigs because when u try to hold them or when u try to pet them they go away and that sucks!!! so ret would be good!!|`|FWlSFpByaa	Guinea pigs smell waaaaayyy more then rats! it only takes the cage about 4 days to become solied and smell aweful! i had a guinea pig for 10 years, trust me i know lol, but sadly she passed in her sleep, and now i have 2 rats and they don't smell at all! I have 2 of them, and i usually change there cage within a week and a half, because its big so it doesn't need to be cleaned every other day! and i have never not once been driven to clean it cuz of the smell, sometimes i forget there there if they weren't moving lol<br>  <br>  DONT get me wrong, GP's are wonderful! but they do smell, i love my guinea pig till the day she died! and i still do, so its up to you!|`|6SxVuHjNaa	i agree with ddale

After he's not a total butterball, if he's not settling in still, stay in the ring and do a lot of transition work.  Correct transitions of all kinds require and will build a strong topline.....

JZ4vL90naa	a good immunization program is essential for your horses health, but just as in humans, vaccination does not guarantee 100% protection.  Immunizing your horse may decrease the severity of disease but  may not prevent it completely. This is due to many complicated reasons, such as differences in the virulence or severity of some diseases (such as influenza).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Your horse is injected with a sterile syringe and needle contained with an inactivated or modified bacteria or virus that is used  to avoid causing the actual disease in the horse. Recently intranasal vaccinations have been developed for immunization against influenza and strangles. Two or more doses are usually needed to initiate an adequate immune response.<br>  <br>  Once the immunization procedure is completed, the protective antibodies in the blood help protect the invasion of specific diseases. Over time, however, these antibodies gradually decline. Therefore, a booster shot is needed at regular intervals. Protection against some diseases such as tetanus and rabies can be accomplished by boostering once a year. Others require more frequent intervals to provide adequate protection.<br>  <br>  VACCINATIONS NEEDED<br>  <br>  The specific immunizations needed by a particular horse or horses depend upon several factors: environment, age, use, geographic location and general management. Your local equine veterinarian can help you determine the vaccination program best suited to your horse's individual needs.<br>  <br>  The following diseases are those most often vaccinated against. Again, your local practitioner will know what is best for your horse.<br>  <br>  TETANUS. Sometimes called "lockjaw," tetanus is caused by toxin-producing bacteria present in the intestinal tract of many animals and found in abundance in the soil where horses live. Its spores can exist for years. The spores enter the body through wounds, lacerations or the umbilicus of newborn foals. Therefore, although not contagious from horse to horse, tetanus poses a constant threat to horses and humans alike.<br>  <br>  Symptoms include muscle stiffness and rigidity, flared nostrils, hypersensitivity and the legs stiffly held in a sawhorse stance. As the disease progresses, muscles in the jaw and face stiffen, preventing the animal from eating or drinking. More than 80% of affected horses die.<br>  <br>  All horses should be immunized annually against tetanus. Additional boosters for mares and foals may be recommended by your veterinarian. Available vaccines are inexpensive, safe and provide good protection.<br>  <br>  ENCEPHALOMYELITIS. More commonly known as "sleeping sickness," this disease is caused by the Western Equine Encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus or the Eastern version (EEE). WEE has been noted throughout North America, while EEE appears only in the east and southeast. VEE, the Venezuelan variety, has not been seen in the United States for many years (however, a recent outbreak of VEE occurred in Mexico). Sleeping sickness is most often transmitted by mosquitoes, after the insects have acquired the virus from birds and rodents. Humans also are susceptible when bitten by an infected mosquito, but direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission is very rare.<br>  <br>  Symptoms vary widely, but all result from the degeneration of the brain. Early signs include fever, depression and appetite loss. Later, a horse might stagger when it walks, and paralysis develops in later stages. About 20-50% of horses infected with WEE die, and the death rate is 75-100% of animals infected with EEE. The mortality rate for VEE is 40-80%.<br>  <br>  All horses need an EEE and WEE vaccine at least annually. Pregnant mares and foals may require additional vaccinations. The best time to vaccinate is one month before mosquitoes become active. In the South and West it is necessary to administer a booster shot every 4 months to ensure extra protection all year-round.<br>  <br>  INFLUENZA. This is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the horse. Highly contagious, the virus can be transmitted by aerosol from horse to horse over distances as far as 30 yards (for example, by snorting or coughing).<br>  <br>  Signs to watch for are similar to those in a human with a cold (i.e. dry cough, nasal discharge, fever, depression and loss of appetite). With proper care, most horses recover in about 10 days. Some, however, may show symptoms for weeks, especially if put back to work too soon. Influenza is not only expensive to treat, but results in a lot of "down time" and indirect financial loss, not to mention discomfort to your horse.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, influenza viruses constantly change in an effort to bypass the horse's immune defense. Therefore, duration of protection is short-lived and revaccination is recommended every 3 to 6 months depending on the vacc|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Talk to your vet, if you bought the horse in your area, then check with the vets in the area and see if they have records on him. You should vaccinate them every year and some have to be done every 6 months. Again, ask your vet. If he came from a barn that required shots, check with them. Hope this helps!|`|hEXb1unraa	Buckinfun has some great resources, why Im answering this question so I have all this info in my saved questions.....thanks|`|px27V5N9aa	You can revaccinate him and start the whole series process over if you wish...to be sure it's done right.<br>  <br>  Vaccinate once then 30 days later revaccinate.  <br>  Depending on where you live will determine how many times a year you vaccinate.  I am in the southeast USA so I do it two times yearly.  When I was in the Northeast USA I did it once yearly.<br>  Coggins yearly<br>  Rabies yearly<br>  <br>  I only do Rhino and Flu if they are exposed to outside horses (shows or a public barn)<br>  <br>  Here are a few links about vaccinations<br>  <a href="http://www.horsequest.com/journal/health/immune.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsequest.com/journal/health...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dclahdvm.com/articles/vaccination.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dclahdvm.com/articles/vaccina...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spequine.com/horse_health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spequine.com/horse_health.htm</a>|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	If 9 months has gone by, it would be safe to vaccinate now. Minimal vaccines would be Eastern and Western Encephalomyelitis, Influenza, and Tetanus.  You may also need Venezuelan Encephalomyelitis, Rhino, Rabies, West Nile.  Now would be the time to vaccinate, before the skeeters come out.  Skeeters are the main vector (carrier) of the EEE/WEE/VEE and West Niles. Check with your vet for what is needed in your area.<br>  You need to vaccinate yearly.  Sometimes influenza can be given every 6 months, again depending on where you live. You may also be required to have a Coggins, if you haul your horse anywheres. Cost would be $70-95 for everything.
xC2qaiaQaa	Everyone else's answers are so confusing, so I am going to make this simple. The key to growing out a mane and tail is good maintenance. Get yourself a tail bag and keep the tail braided and inside the bag at all times. But leave the short whispier layers out of the braid and bag. You will probably need to redo the braid every week, depending on your horse's hair texture and thickness. Never brush the tail. Get a Very Wide Toothed comb and gently pick your way through tangles with the help of detangler. Until the mane gets long enough to braid, you should use a wide tooth comb on it to keep it free of tangles. you will also want to keep both the mane and tail clean and conditioned. Afer you shampoo them, put plenty of conditioner in and let it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing, this strenghtens and improves the hair quality. There is also a product called Shapley's original M-T-G, which claims to add 2 incches of growth to your horses mane/tail each month. You can find it in any horse store.|`|BKXMl8E8aa	Hey, well depending on what kind of horse you have, which it really does matter when it comes to the hair. Get a biotin product and that will help but it also makes the hooves grow faster too. Uhm... mane and tail conditioner lather it in without water gently brush through it and let it dry. You really dont want to keep it braided cause that's a fast way for it to get riped out like on fencing and stuff. You can use peanut hay that'll make it grow and make the horse really shinny and purdie but to much can make'm have a runny stool.|`|pTmrZicfaa	Keep them braided when they get long enough, and make sure his diet is well suited for him. My guy had no mane or tail when I got him 5 months ago... His tail grew at least 2 inches and his mane is almost all the way down his neck which is pretty thick =)<br>  Try not to make split ends when you care for the mane and tail. Brush your fingers through lightly to keep knots to a minimum to avoid more split ends later on. I use a rubber brush, you could use that very carefully too. Fingers are probably better if you want it to grow faster though.<br>  The key is always: Be gentle with it, keep knots out as much as possible, avoid split ends, and always put soft braids in (running braids and french braids are good if the mane is long enough)... Wrapping the tail is good too when they go out to pasture.<br>  But as Blair F mentioned, some horses won't have long manes or tails... I know a horse whose tail wouldn't go past his hocks!<br>  Good luck!|`|JZ4vL90naa	just let it grow and brush it or comb it so i doesn't get knotted and wash it but not during the winter|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I totally agree with "hahachick"<br>  <br>  I just came her to vouch for MTG.

Any breed can have that.  i have seen QH's with quite thin manes and tails.  Fresians have thick manes so if your horse is a friesian dont thin it out- if it is any breed and has a luxourious thick mane and tail, again, dont thin it.  If it's moderate, then you can take a fine-tooth metal mane comb (forgetting its usual name right now >.<) and you take the end of the mane/tail and twist the hairs around it.  quickly pull hard and it will thin it out.  it will hurt the horse if you pull slowly, but if you take it out quick, then thats good.  Don't tear it out like a mass murderer (bad comparison)!<br>  I hope i helped- thats a lovely horse.<br>  EDIT<br>  im being confusing.  Explain to me if you want a long or thin mane and/or tail.  If you want long, get a sleazy sleepwear hood and it'll grow (dont use the comb- that may or may not shorten it.) and for the tail, braid it loosely and put it into a tailbag.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	there's nothing really spectacular about it- it's just pretty much a normal arab pasture mane/tail, but the owner does take the time to keep them clean and picked/brushed out.<br>  Not all horses will have extremely long manes.

I have a 14 week old labby who i want to breed and now im debating to i buy a boy for her or just get a semen straw lol i want a second dog but yer. I would assess the situation. Can you house 2 dogs, can you afford 2 dogs what will you do if the dogs dont get along. Do you have the time to put in the training where its needed and do you feel that this will benefit the family. Remembering if it goes bad its not just you who suffers the pup will also be pushed off to another home. If your not sure what your dogs like with other dogs go to the dog park and find out. If all goes well then there is one good reason to get another dog!|`|sgEazAn2aa	well to see how yor dog is going to react you should just foster a dog and see if you and your dog are ready for this big step. That way you can test it and see how your dog will react but it wont be a perrnamint dog. Honestly think about how much fun you have with your dogs. And if you buy a dog your giving it a safe home and think of how great of an owner you were.
UIM8X38Oaa	It will most likely depend on the market by the time you are ready to purchase.  And as for a stallion probably 15,000.00 and up.  It depends on the blood lines.  And same with the mare.  I would say 7,000.00 and up for a good broodmare.<br>  Since you still have time until you are ready to purchase I would suggest you spend as much time as you can studying the breed and shoping around.  There is so much to learn.  Checkout this website below, they have some of the top of the line stallions at there farm just for one example but there are sooo many farms with great stallions check out the arab registry for starts.<br>  I <br>  www.MidwestArabian.com<br>  <br>  Become a member of the arabian horse registry if you are not already at www.arabianhorses.org  to learn about the seepstakes and futurity programs etc.<br>   <br>  Thanks for the question,<br>  I love my arabian horses.<br>  Jenny|`|vGTzWCjraa	I went to a invitation Arabian auction at a Arabian farm near home that was going out of business.  They sold their main stallion that had won world 5 or 6 times for 2.5 million dollars or so I was told.  He was the most breathtaking animal that I've ever seen and I'm partial to Quarter Horses.  Buy magazines for Arab breeders start educating yourself on current breeding trends.  What was popular 20 yrs ago is not what is being breed for now.  Get out to shows and talk to people.  Also a mare does need to be reasonably trained.  She doesn't have to be started under saddle but she needs to be good to handle.  People won't buy foals that come from a crazy mare.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	ok first of all an arabian broodmare with good bloodlines <br>  <a href="http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/classifieds/ad366938" rel="nofollow">http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...</a><br>  <br>  most are around 1,000!!! mostly because the market is down but thats good. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh well stallions are very very ONLY for the experienced but ok: <a href="http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/classifieds/ad287295" rel="nofollow">http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...</a><br>  <a href="http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/classifieds/ad325212" rel="nofollow">http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...</a><br>  good bloodlines:<br>  <a href="http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/classifieds/ad354523" rel="nofollow">http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...</a><br>  <br>  around 9-15,000|`|LrYcvGgiaa	A good broodmare should also have a show history, or have done something that would be a good reason to continue her bloodline.  <br>  <br>  Right now the market is horrible so you could probably pick up broodmares for under $2000, people are practically giving horses away (not exactly the best time to be opening a breeding facility).  Show mares with experience would be more than that though. $5000-10,000
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	The human fetus is asexual for a while - not a girl or a boy.  Every boy has a Y chromosome from conception.  The hormones are what cause the undifferentiated sexual organs of the fetus to become male or female.  The Y chromosome causes the production of testosterone, the X, estrogen.  As adults all humans have certain amounts of both hormones in their bodies.  One is more predominant than the other, thus males and females.|`|QbOYIixuaa	Yes all babies are girls in the beginning.

My science teacher told me yesterday that everyone started off as a girl..the reproductive organs, the DNA and everything else wasn't finalized yet so every boy was once a girl....creepy|`|8q82dLS8aa	Yes, we all start out as "girls" but guys develop a y chromosome later in the pregnancy|`|Q0umYPvAaa	Yes everyone is started as a girl but sometimes a Y chromosome gets into the mix to create a boy instead of all x's which creates a girl.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	He is probably in pain, or if he's taking pain medication that can be the reason for what you are perceiving as "sad" behavior.  His body is in shock and he needs rest - he's been through a very traumatic experience and has to heal.  He won't eat much if he's on pain meds either - and that is fine for a few days as long as he's drinking water.  He'll eat when he's ready - don't worry about that - and he won't poop until he's eating again.  You may need to walk him outside - or carry him out - to pee for a few days - just take your cues from the dog.  Watch for any vomiting or blood coming out anywhere it's not supposed to be and call your vet immediately if you suspect there is something serious going on.|`|9Hz5NekJaa	i have heard of dogs dieing from sadness a dog who doesnt have a mate(grl dog) dies of it cuz she needs to have a mate unless you operate her but anyways you can try buying another dog and make them interact with eachother or ask a vet wat you should do they might be able to make play dates with your dog and other dogs or you can make playdates your dog has to love something just try this its sad to see your dog sad i understand your pain i have 4 dogs i luv them so much but take my advice and sorry for what happend to your dog i hope he gets well|`|IS4ND9Sjaa	dogs go through depression just like people do. he may just be in a lot of pain and that's why he isn't moving or eating. when he has to use the restroom he will let you know trust me. if he's not eating it may be due to his level of pain. just remember when we don't feel good or are in pain we don't feel like doing much of anything. i know other people say dogs are dumb and have no feelings but i know that's a lie they feel just like we do. if you are really worried about your puppy check with your vet to see what they say. if you want to try to get him to eat then try to boil some plain chicken and give a little at a time to see if it will work. i hope your baby gets better soon. best of luck to you.|`|peB3XgiGaa	It can't kill literally, but if he gets a serious illness and doesn't have a will to live it can contribute to whether or not he gets better. Take him to the vet. If he's not eating that's a problem. Get him checked out!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	He knows he sick and hurt, he doesn't feel good.  Let him relax and heal.<br>  <br>  Follow your vets advice and if you have questions, call the vet.|`|xK8KR6Hjaa	I'm not aware of then dying explicitly from sadness, but severe sadness can lead to depression, refusing to eat, lethargy, etc. And the dog could just waste away. I wouldn't worry too much about this one since it has had a sudden severe injury. Try to keep the house calm and quiet, and cuddle and pet the dog as much as you can. Keep him warm, talk to him constantly. They need to feel secure and loved and protected. It could be a couple days before he wants to eat. By day three or four I would call a vet if he's still not eating. <br>  When my rabbit had surgery it took her a couple days to start coming to her senses. I would lay on the floor next to her for extended periods of time being very calm and just slowly petting her. She would just lay with her eyes closed. Once she started feeling better, she would jump up onto the bed when she wanted to be closer to me.|`|UDAWwyk8aa	SOOO SORRY! We had something similar happen to one of our dogs a long time ago. My mom went to the store and bough some liver  and she boiled it with a little bit of rice and bits of carrots and made our dog some home made dog food. My mom didn't add any salt or anything but our dog little by little starting eating it. My mom chopped up the liver in tiny little pieces and kinda mushed the rice and carrots in it. Dogs love liver and it has so many nutrients that he needs to get his strength back. He probably is in so much pain and feeling crappy because he isn't himself. I would try to pet and love him as much as you can and spoil him rotten. Not sure what a vet would say about my recipe but if he wont eat his regular food or treats he needs to eat something.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	You need to calm down.Your dog got hit by a car,how shook up do you think he is?He is the one that got hit.Give him a couple of days to re-adjust.He has stitches,he probably aches all over.Just keep talking to him and loving him,he will snap out of it.|`|HrewRe7saa	Sadness doesn't kill, but it can lead to things that will.<br>  <br>  You dog may refuse to eat out of depression, or other things of the sort.<br>  <br>  Also the wounds could become infected, keep an eye on your dog.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	Well, he just got hit by a car and he needs time to heal. Just give him your love and follow the vet's advice and in no time he'll be good as new.|`|bIaywrBCaa	He is in a lot of pain I am sure and that is why he looks so sad. The vet should have given you instructions on how to care for him. Keep water close by so he can drink if he wants. He will probably not eat for a day or so. He should be okay for not eating that long, main thing is to get him to drink. Can he walk at all? I wouldn't try moving him just yet. Lay him on a blanket or something where he will be comfortable and he may soil it so use one that can be thrown away. I hope he is feeling better soon.
pDWrOl8oaa	Obviously there is nothing you can do except get him to a vet when you are able. The sooner, the better.|`|AtiNu3Ovaa	Take him to the vet immediately. He needs at the very least xrays, and possibly surgery if the screw got caught up anywhere.|`|KZ7BeVRaaa	Look up the phone number of your nearest emergency vet and rush him there.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I think it is good food.  The dry has a lot of grain and peas which are not really that great for a cat diet.  I mean it is proportionately higher than some others.  They state proudly that they include four meat protein sources and the others are very far down the list.<br>  <br>  The only bag I have here is Wellness - that ingredient list reads chicken, chicken meal, brown rice......so that has a little more meat protein than the Felidae.   Wellness is fudging a bit by putting the chicken first as a wet chicken weighs more than chicken meal and the ingredients must by law be listed by weight. Only one of my five cats eats dry food, the others have canned and a raw meat diet I make at home.<br>  <br>  The Wellness canned does have sweet potato, squash and carrots - no rice as in the Felidae.  And the other canned foods I use (Instincts, Avoderm, Natural Balance)  also have the vegetables rather far down the list of ingredients.<br>  <br>  My cats don't like the Felidae canned nor the dry.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	I don't have a problem with Felidae. I used to feed it to my kitty but now she gets Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul because it's cheaper but still very high quality.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Some people don't like it because it has grain in it,but I think it's a very good cat food.I wish I could,afford to feed it,but I have 15 cats! If your cats are doing well on it,just pay no attention to what other people think.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	1. Because it has grains in it.<br>  2. Because dry cat food is linked to chronic dehydration.
4AfRTzRmaa	ok <br>  <br>  1. collection<br>  ~achieved by driving them into the bit, squeze with your calfs and lift your hands with the reins<br>  <br>  2.extension<br>  ~lenghing to the strides ex. extended trot<br>  <br>  3. Changes in speed<br>  ~when you get a good working trot, start posting slower and slowly get tension on the reing (dont pull too much you dont want your hands at your nose :))  to go faster you want to ever so slightly squeeze with your calves, that cues her to go gaster. <br>  <br>  4. jumping<br>  ~small jumps practice your 2-point :) over any thing, poles, small logs or nothing just ride in a 2 point. this opens up their back so you can let them jump freely. <a href="http://www.bmslab.com/images/up/iStock_horse-jumping.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmslab.com/images/up/iStock_h...</a> the rider here is 2-pointing very well. out of the saddle looking at the next jump. BUT remember dont LEAN!!! it may look like she is but, trust me she is not. have funn:)|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I was taught to slow down your trot (or speed up) slow (or speed up) your post. You can do things like trot 5 strides, jog 4 strides, walk 3 strides. Things like that to slow down, you can vary it to however you would like to do it, it seems to work pretty well. You can also do circles at certain speeds, make patters, you can get cones at a sporting goods store or feed store for really cheap. I like to make patterns for my students and ask them to extend or slow down at certain points, this gives you a visual and its fun to make your own patterns. I do mostly western or on the flat English so I cant really help you with the grids but I hope this helps!|`|vGTzWCjraa	Everything mentioned are great ideas.  I like to incorporate dressage moves to help my horses with flexibility and gait control.  You can find lots online and if you have a couple of extra $s try Amazon or such for used DVDs about dressage.  It really adds to whatever you want to do with your horse since it's all about control and using your legs not your hands.  It's helped me to train several horses to win national and state level awards.|`|AA10100463	Collection comes after extension. Extension is easy...use hands. Do not slow down..gradually increase speed...with rythm. When its time for collection use a beer glass. You can use a wide mouth if you like. First trials would confirm if someone hate the taste. If your farm is mechanized collection and extension can be achieved in one go...use the same equipment that is used for milking cows.|`|pTmrZicfaa	To extend you just loosen up and encourage your horse to go forward more. Not to speed up, but open his gate. You want to do the same with the collection, only reverse and get more contact on the mouth. It's really about encouragement and asking/proposing.<br>  <br>  When you want to slow down, tighten up your core and ab muscles, slow down your post and again, encourage him to slow down. Again, use contact on the mouth. If he slows down too much, add very little leg. Just enough to get back into trot. Keep contact on the mouth so that he doesn't think "Go into working trot". <br>  If you would like more activities, working on circles are a good exercise.<br>  <br>  Bending work: getting your horse to flex down and relax so his head goes down and he raises his back and bum slightly. Almost like he's leaning forward. Circle work should get him to bend. Do different sizes of circles too: one end of the arena, half the arena, and do them in different areas too. <br>  <br>  Serpentine is good to. Weave like a snake back and forth from one end of the arena down to the other. Figure eights and diagonal work is good as well.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can you can do leg yields on the long side of the arena. When you come around the corner, stay slightly inside of the arena wall, then start to encourage your horse back out to the wall before you reach the other corner.<br>  <br>  I hope that you understand these and that they will be interesting for you and your horse!<br>  And remember, you always want to encourage and propose something. He will understand and be much more accepting of what you are asking.<br>  I'm sorry I don't know much about jumping... I'm a flat work kind of gal =)<br>  Good luck!|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	for collection you can keep your posting at the same tempo, but check and release with the reins and and squeeze with your legs. you can do some stuff with trotting poles but i don't know if you would consider that the flat. to extend you can speed up your posting a bit, maybe squeeze your legs but keep the horse in check with the reins. try not to let the horse speed up, but to change the length of his/her strides. <br>  <br>  sometimes if you get a little bored and you have enough room, you could entertain yourself and keep the horse thinking by creating a dressage course or obstacle course and try to improve your time all by yourself. just make sure you're horse is familiar with the objects before you try to go fast.
B6zl0AJDaa	The best bet for putting your bridle back together is take a picture of it first, then print it out on your pc then put sticky notes on each part, ex:  right cheek piece goes to the right side of your crown piece so it would be #1, that side of the crown piece would be #2.  If you have a brow band then the right side of the brow band would be #3, etc.<br>  <br>  Best use liquid glycerin or a glycerin bar to CLEAN the leather first, then when it's clean, use a conditioner like Horseman's One Step.<br>  <br>  As for billet straps, seeing how English ones are ATTACHED to the saddle and NOT removable, I'm guessing you have a western saddle.<br>  Front off Billet:  Goes on the right front side of your saddle to which your front cinch is attached.  The flank billets are placed on the rear either slots or dee rings of your saddle to which your flank cinch is then attached.  ALWAYS make sure you have a connector strap attached from your flank cinch to the small dee ring on the center of your front cinch.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	oiler cleaner i use is neatsfoot! becarefull though it darkens leather. <br>  <br>  billet straps are not normally supposed to come off :( sorry they are under the saddle where you attach the girth]<br>  <br>  when you clean a bridle you dont have to take it off and put it back just clean the whole thing whole. :)|`|xzJi0bcSaa	well, if you take it apart, lay it out piece by piece in the order you took it apart. You can use leather cleaner, lexol works, Farnam works too. Take a dry sponge/rag and spray it on the sponge and work it in. Make sure you get any excess off and then put the bridle back together. Wash the bit with a little bit of soap and water and make sure you rinse it off well. Billet straps are on an English saddle and shouldnt be removed. The bridle mostly consist of cheek pieces, crown piece, brow band, throat latch, cavesson if its an english bridle, bit, reins, and curb strap if its a western bridle. Hope this helps!
tB7QK6BTaa	English are excellent low energy dogs, for those who like low energy, however, three puppies at one time is a big undertaking.  English are not the easiest dogs to manage, being somewhat hard headed, and they do best with experienced and knowledgeable handlers who understand the entire Pack Leader Energy equation.  Three such puppies raised without firm Leadership will most certainly turn into a nightmare.  <br>  <br>  If you are an experienced owner, and have the time and commitment, this can work out.  If, on the other hand, you are a first time inexperienced dog owner, I wouldn't suggest even one of these dogs as a starter dog, much less three.<br>  <br>  Good dogs are not about love, good dogs are about Leadership.|`|AA10112346	You need to train them alot they needs lots and lots of it.<br>  <br>  Kudos on doing this.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Considering that you've got the time and finances..

Just make sure you can afford their vet care and to feed them, and give them lots of love and affection otherwise it's not fair to them.
5I01tsgYaa	Dark urine usually indicates a high level of proteins in the dog's urine.  It's indicative of dehydration or a "malfunction" of the kidneys.  You're right.  Have your mom keep a urine sample to take to the vet and have it tested.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Ok, coffee color is probably more than just a bladder infection.  It's probably some sort of kideny infection or worse.  It's serious.  Get the dog to the vet right away.  No, don't wait till morning and no, the urine in the carpet can't be used as a urine sample.

As unpleasant as it is to have a live critter running amuck in your ceiling, a dead one methinks would be much worse.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Squirrels are rather large to not see them scampering about in your house. It is more likely a chipmunk or rat, rats can be dealt with by traps and poison. When using poison put it near water, for some reason animals that are dieing of poison try and go to water. A chipmunk can be dealt with the same way, they are just about the same size as a rat.<br>  <br>  Could also be mice or moles, traps as well.<br>  <br>  They don't stay in the ceiling, they come out for food and water every once in a while. Traps have bait on them.|`|7AI58IS8aa	omg i had the exact same problem like 2 years ago. We had like rats or mice in our ceiling, and at nighttime, I could always hear them running and squeaking.

If the animals are really a pest, then you should call the PEst Control. BEfore u do that, but those trap thingies for rodents. THey worked for us at our old house. ANyways, good luck!

Oiabe82gaa	For weight gain you need to feed a high fat diet. I use rice bran, as well as a 20% fat feed for working/hard to keep horses, as well as sugar beet and hay, approx. 12-14lbs. I feed this twice a day to my hard to keep Standard Bred, he is hard to keep weight on, and as I step his workload up I'll increase his feed!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|RloOJ43haa	There might be an underlying issue. It would take a vet check to tell for sure. You probably could up his hay to 4-5 flakes per day or free choice if you can.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	That is it? That is way too little of food for even a normal horse, and TBs are usually harder to keep weight on than most horses.<br>  <br>  First of all, increase the hay (slowly) to 3-4 flakes TWICE a day. 2-3 flakes twice a day is normal for most horses, and you want your guy to gain weight. <br>  <br>  I would increase the hay, wait at least 2-3 weeks and see if you notice a difference before adding more grain, as weight gained by roughage is better for their digestive system. If that doesn't work, increase the grain as well.<br>  <br>  Our TB is fine with low to moderate work on 3-4 flakes twice a day, and about 8 lbs of grain (4 am, 4 pm). My friend's TB is on heavy work (6 days a week riding) and gets 15 lbs of grain (half a safe energy source, half a fat source) and 4-5 flakes of hay twice a day to maintain a good weight|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I would rule out a medical problem.  He may just be like the TB we had in college.  He got fed grain twice a day and plenty of free choice hay while turned out in pasture and still didn't keep weight on.  It wasn't until we started exercising him regularly that he finally got to looking like he was gaining weight.  It may just have been more muscle development, but when he pulled a flexor tendon and had to be rested from riding, he went right back to looking unthrifty and skinny.  Course he was 17hh but this may be something for you to consider.|`|XL62syrCaa	Have you had a recent vet check done? Whens the last time he had his teeth floated?<br>  <br>  He needs to be eating more hay. Try giving him free choice hay (as much as he will eat) My 14.2 ate 4-5 flakes a day. He needs more forage and maybe some beet pulp. <br>  <br>  On top of the fact that he is a TB (they tend to be hard keepers)<br>  <br>  Make sure the hay is good quality and has plenty of nutrients (I like good green grass hay or orchard). Also if you can get him out on a pasture so he can free graze most of the day. Horses are natural foragers and are healthier when they are eating 24/7|`|CgEjK7NGaa	For weight-gain issues, definitely consult your vet first. He should be able to recommend a safe, effective feeding routine.<br>  <br>  He may also recommend bran, beet pulp, or supplements.|`|vBR9nB81aa	Your food amounts seem normal. You could up his hay to 5 flakes a day. 2 for morning and evening feedings and 1 for lunch. Consult your vet if you really feel the weight gain is an issue. If not, there is a great supplement that I have given many many horses. It is called Amplify and it is made by Purina. It worked significantly well in the Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds I used it in. I bought a tub for each horse and was satisfied by the end of it. It wasnt a supplement where I needed to keep them on it all the time. I do not know the circumstances of your horse or whatever but this is from my personal experience.|`|0d22uiaaaa	It depends on how long it has been since he has been wormed and what he looked like when you got him. Gradually increase the hay, I don't think that it is enough for a TB. They eat more than a normal horse does. Mine ate enough for two horses and this kept him in good looking shape, without overfeeding. If his ribs show even slightly, he is not getting enought to eat. If he has been wormed you will, just like I said, have to adjust gradually. It may take some time to get him in good condition and once you are there then you will know how much to feed him all the time.|`|GbtRPEuxaa	dose he have a blanket<br>  the best feed for putting weight on a horse quick is sterling complete feed<br>  its green pellets and  its very digestible for horses I have taken several skin and bone horses and stick them in a stall and pored all they could eat to them with alfalfa and in thirty days along with tube worming by a vet and teeth floating and lice dusting just and get them current on all shots minimum exercise the nice thing about sterling is you can not founder one on it I like to give a small hand full of calf mana it really makes them shine|`|0DhFhzDGaa	How slim is he??<br>  <br>  Some thoroughbreds are just built slim, and it can be unhealthy to force them to gain so much weight(like people-someone who can eat a lot but still be skinny should have to eat even more just so they can be fat...)<br>  <br>   Anyways I have a few thoroughbreds with a weight problem as well.<br>  <br>    I found that free feeding really helps with weight!!<br>   I was feding a thoroughbred I just got 4 flakes of alfalfa a day and grain, but he was just not gaining any weight. i put him in pasture where he eats 2 flakes of alfalfa and free fed on grass-he is way too fat!!<br>  <br>  Anywayz what diet works best with my guys is:<br>   free fed(2-4 flakes grass per day) <br>   1-2 flakes alfalfa per day(depends on how much work they are doing)<br>   flax seed with suppies.-I don't feed grain much anymore<br>   <br>    Also try rice bran watered down!! Really helps! ** i have never found beep pulp to help weight problems!!<br>  <br>  Maybe de-worm your horse again..sometimes they may spit it out but you don't see that. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	I would have some basic blood work done on him to make sure he's healthy. After that unless you have had him for a long time and know he's had a regular worming programme you should reworm him a couple more times cause things like the red worm can take ages to clear.<br>  <br>  I used to have a similar problem with my tb who wouldn't put weight on, he's now on 2 scoops of Alfa A oil, 2 scoops of sugar beet and a scoop of conditioning feed plus as much hay as he will eat and he's piling weight on nicely
tB7QK6BTaa	The answer will be as simple to attain and as close as your Vet.  Anything else is guessing.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Some of the things you need to look for are mange, ringworm and thyroid problems and allergies.  Mange is a mite under the skin that cause them to lose hair and itch and ringworm is a fungus under the skin that causes them to itch and lose hair but it usually has a ring look (circular) look to it.  Allergies also will make a dog itch and lose hair.  You need to take the dog to a vet and have it checked because if it is mange you need some medicine for it to kill the mites.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	hey! sounds like your dog has hot spot! The best thing to do for these if you dont want to go to a vet is shave or trim back the hair around the area, go to the pharmacy and buy an anti bacterial cream and apply it to the area. Betadine also help but can cause a little bit of scarring so i wouldnt recommed prolonged use around the face. They do spread so use gloves and practice good hygiene ie new disposable cloths for each area of the body. They are very common in dogs who like water such as labbys and golden retreivers! If not relief in 7-10 days consult your vet. also keep the dog away from other dogs!|`|3hyrFAeCaa	they could be hot spot you could try the topica medication walmart sells if that don't help go to the vet
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Love...fyi...smaller dogs do get low blood sugar level.  The pet stores carry "nuti-cal" for this very purpose.  She should be getting it at least every 3 days if not more...all depending on her weight.  Take some sugar (just wet your finder and put it on her tongue.  Do this about 5x.  Keep her warm and watch her breathing.  Make sure it is not labored nor too slow.  Just talk with her easy, hold her and pet her.  Keep her stimulated enough to keep her aware of her surroundings but not with too much stimulation.  If you have a syringe give her small amounts of water in between sugar licks.  Check her eyes if they are dilated at all get to the vet asap.  Check her gums if they are not pink but a pastie white asap to the vet she is not doing good, anemia is setting in and she will weaken quickly.  I realize not everywhere has a vet open 24/7 or an emergency place...so do the best with what you have.  If the sugar doesn't seem to change anything within 20 min. do it again.  Don't do it fast or act upset...stay calm because it will help your dog not to over react.  I will be praying for you both.  Good luck...let us know how it goes.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Has she been exposed to anything that could poison her like antifreeze?  She really needs to see a vet right away.  You could give her some Pepto-bismol only about 2.0cc to help coat her tummy but she needs to see a vet.  Chi's are so tiny and can't take very much.  Has she had all her shots?  Parvo is a nasty virus that they vomit with.  Hope this helps.  Take Care!|`|hxBwRt09aa	Vomit happens, occasionally. What did she get into to make her vomit? Is she just tired or is she limp when you pick her up? If you're afraid that she's dying then why are you wasting time posting this? Get your vet's office on the phone.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Has she been vomiting a lot or just once?If it continues,you need a vet.If it was once,she probably got into something she should not have.Her tummy is upset,I would not give her anything more than water for now.|`|HrewRe7saa	The vet really is the best option.  I wish I could provide a better answers or other alternatives.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	ok the first thing you need to do is check her reflexes. Can she hear you, see you etc. I would then drop something on the floor that would normally cause her to run and hide. If she runs and hides then it probably isnt as serious as you think. if she just lays there you have a bigger problem. Offer her water and see how she goes if she wont drink i would get a syringe and drop some in her mouth to check if she is able to swallow of course also check her breathing. also check her temp if you can. A thermometer up the behind for a minute if its a mercury one or until its beeps for digital. from 37-38 is ok. if she has just been for a walk or something not that long ago expect a little higher.anything over 40 is an emergency. Think about what she could have ingested poison wise. like ratsac, snail bate etc. If this is a possibility i would call the poisons line and ask them what to do. All in all though i would recommend the vet. I havent had a lot of experience with older pups just the new borns. If you need anymore help email me at beckelljess@hotmail.com|`|0ZrRRGmiaa	My chi went dead stiff too.... out of fright but did not puke. Another dog attacked him and he went stiff. My hubby ran him outside when it was raining and let the water splash over him. He resurrected quickly though, less then 5 minutes. I did call the vet and they said bring him in NOW, but then he went back to normal. I did get him checked the next day and he had been in such a deep shocked state his heart had stopped. He is fine now though and still going strong. I hope your chihuahua gets better!!|`|Wt1pZpANaa	just let her rest and make sure that shes breathing and yeah it would help to call the vet..|`|bIaywrBCaa	sounds like she may be having a seizure. First get some honey or syrup ir something to rub on her gums in case it is low sugar, then wrap her up and get her to a vet asap.
xHxKDQ80aa	I did payments for my reg. boxer. Which was awesome. Some breeders will let you do it but most will not. You could try a mainecoon rescue group, sometimes your local no-kill shelter will have some mainecoon kittens.<br>  <br>  Kijiji has breeders that you could find in your area :)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you are looking at a pedigree one, most breeders will charge about $600 for pet quality - for show quality it would be several hundred more.  If this is too high of a price you can look for a retired breeding cat for about 1/2 the price, or a Maine Coon rescue group or in the shelters.  The shelters have many Maine Coon look alikes for around $150.<br>  <br>  Look on Petfinder.com for one.  If you want a purebred, here's a website that lists breeders to contact.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breedlist.com/maine-coon-breeders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breedlist.com/maine-coon-bree...</a>|`|pDWrOl8oaa	And what makes you think you're going to find a solution on yahoo anwers. You should be looking for a Maine Coon rescue group or breeder, who I seriously doubt take payments.

7HxJvbjMaa	It sounds like she has allergies or fleas (or allergies to fleas). <br>  Will she let you put some olive oil in her ears? It'll help.<br>  Treat her with Advantage or Frontline (put it on top of her head, not between the shoulder blades).<br>  And sorry, but nothing by Purina is high quality... just my opinion. Try feeding her more canned food, it's better for cats than kibble. My cat gets a small can a day, 1/2 in the am and 1/2 in the pm supplemented with kibble.|`|d5LyTTVKaa	you just have an EVIL cat.. if your not attached to the cat i would get rid of it.....<br>  <br>  sorry to tell you|`|KZ7BeVRaaa	If your vet refuses to see your cat, find another vet.  That is beyond unacceptable, and she'd be in better hands elsewhere, anyway.  There are also ways for the vet to tranquilize your cat or calm her down (such as Xanax), which makes things much easier for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  Is the biting and scratching during petting serious, or is it only mild?  Cats will often give you "love bites" or play rough while you pet them without meaning any real harm.<br>  <br>  The earwax issue might be something that can be helped with medicated drops, or it may be something akin to earmites.  Have you tried dry shampoo for the dandruff issue?  If you don't already, I recommend brushing her coat daily to avoid excess shedding or matted hair.|`|pDWrOl8oaa	I suspect your cat has allergies. You can try switching her to a lamb/rice food (canned food is NOT better than dry food as one person said... dry food helps to scrape the teeth as they chew, canned food does not. A combonation of canned and dry food is fine.) You can also try giving her chlorapheneramine 4mg tablets. It's a safe to use antihistomine. You can give it twice a day. Also, you can try an outmeal based shampoo to alleviate the dry skin. Perhaps supplement with fish oil. And on the matter of the vet, you might try sedating the cat before a vet appointment. Some cats can not be forced into allowing strangers to handle them. Maybe you should just let them sedate her for exams. It's less stress on the cat and the humans involved. Good Luck!
tB7QK6BTaa	Feeding pets alcohol and/or drugs as a way of entertaining yourself at their expense is abuse, plain and simple, no matter how you paint it.<br>  <br>  Dogs are carnivores, as such, carbohydrates of any kind, particularly the high density kind that beer represents, are not healthy.<br>  <br>  On the other side, no, a beer will not cause an overdose, it would just be an ignorant thing to do.|`|AA10112346	Only on tuesdays.|`|zSpFXIrfaa	yeah u can give him a little.. not the whole beer tho. dogs have eaten pot off the ground before, its so funny xD|`|eBEfZO9eaa	You should never give animals alcohol, it can kill them.

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Not eating or drinking is quite common.  Vaccinations can make them sick, although, normally, they will not vomit.

AND NOT AT A VETS OFFICE??|`|ak9DrBSwaa	While a big advocate of vet care for small pets, I'm not inclined to agree with other posters in this case.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention the species, but it does sound like you know what it is and what the average life span for that type of hamster is and that yours is at the end of it.<br>  <br>  Wet Tail - 3 days without treatment, survival is unlikely even with a vets visit. I'm not sure I'd put him through a 4 hour drive each way when survival is unlikely. You could try the OTC wet tail meds, but thats really only useful for Syrians and only treats symptoms and not the underlying cause. The bottom of a hamster with wet tail is normally yucky, in addition to evidence in his bedding, so I'm not inclined with the info given to think he has wet tail.<br>  <br>  Have you checked his water bottle? Make sure that the end is not clogged, even if it appears full. A clogged bottle can result in a hamster going down hill rapidly; its one reason I like to have two bottles in our cages. You can check for deydration by scruffing your hamster and seeing how fast the skin goes down. If he appears dehydrated, look up the dose for unflavored pedialyte for hamsters.  (Pedialyte is a fluid replacement for human babies that you can find in most US grocery or discount stores).<br>  <br>  Underweight - see what you can get him to eat. Healthier is better, but this is one of those cases that anything is better than nothing if he's refusing his normal stuff. Hard boiled egg yolk is often a good source of protein for an ailing hamster.<br>  <br>  Making your pet more comfortable - be sure cage is out of drafts and warm or cool enough depending on where you are. Extra bedding to stay warm in is good. Easy access to food and water. Quiet area of the house, so he can rest.|`|TF75BDGNaa	i am so sorry :-( i think it is worth it to take him to a vet. if there is any way of him having a good happy recovery a vet will know. i hope will be ok!!!|`|Zf4Zoo6Uaa	hmm well this happened to my hamster not the same things but sounds alot like mine he didnt move and he was acting strange( he died 3 days later) and hamster usually have about 3-4 years to live so i dont know maybe
AA11887983	Probably more effective to scrape the dog's nails along the cement outside, manually.  <br>  <br>  Seriously, it takes so long to do a single nail that it is ridiculous.

The motor is very weak.  I don't even think it would work on small dogs like a chi or yorkie.   I know it doesnt' work on my dogs.

I used it on my dog and I hated it! The grinder takes like an hour to grind down a centimeter. The noise freaks dogs out and the grinder isn't that strong.

When he is done playing with it give him some love, cats are very proud when they are able to hunt an kill something.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	most cats slowly torture it to death. could take hours. they injure it so it cant run fast, they let it go and catch it again.<br>  one of my cats never kills them, he plays soccer with them. runs while whacking the mouse back and forth between his paws.<br>  im sure the mouse prays for death.<br>  <br>  they wont always eat it, usually they eat the head and leaver the body somewhere where you can step on it.<br>  cats have a sick sense of humor.<br>  a few unlucky cat owners find the dead mouse in the bed with them.<br>  some kind of cat warning , i guess.<br>  <br>  shoo cat into a room, close door. she will cry when she wants out.<br>  then you have to look for the body.<br>  <br>  found a dead bunny in the middle of my living room once.|`|fe4bb1e462c1b1964d0d8e86a7ed06d2aa	Objective lesson about cats # 1.<br>  <br>  When they bring a live mouse into the house they are not actually trying to play with it. In point of actual fact they are trying to train YOU how to catch YOUR supper. It is a very close bonding ritual. Cats often look upon humans as being, basically nothing more than stupid big kittens. We don't behave like a cat. We don't hunt. We don't preen. We don't go outside to ........ Get the idea.<br>  Just walk up to the cat and make lots of "Oh you wonderful thing", and, "Is that for me" noises. Broom and pan in hand. then see what happens. As for the dogs: the excitement of the 'hunt' in addictive.|`|IK6FZ5TPaa	Just toughen up and save the mouse!  Pick it up with like big huge oven mittens and through it outside, or something!  Make your cat stop torturing it!  The mouse is smaller then you, and is even more terrified then you are of it!  I mean, you can stomp on it, and the worst thing the mouse can do to you is leave a few scratch marks, or a scar from bitting you, or rabies.  lol that is pretty bad..but still..just get the mouse out of there.  The quicker you do it the quicker you can relax!|`|1EBn5A6daa	go in there and try and throw a blanket over the cat and mouse, see<br>  if you can scoop them up and put them outside then get your cat to drop the thing outside and get your cat back inside or wait till they kill the poor mouse and scoop the dead mouse up and take him out side.......good luck sweetie|`|VkXQq2y2aa	My cat, Cassie, always catches mice. <br>  She might eat it, she might not. Just go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  What exactly are you scared of?|`|10zHV2thaa	save the mouse save becuase its bad for the cat to eat not al of it will come out and that cause problems|`|fjLluy2baa	what a good kitty she will kill it when she is finished having fun
443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	Yes, agreed.....it drives me nuts!!  :oP<br>  <br>  Oh, and there are a few other things that drives me nuts also............there is NO MONEY to take our puppies, "all 10 of them" to the Vet for puppy checks!!  And, they are growing bigger, but we didn't "expect" that!!!  Now, we are tired from them and they pee all over the house and we don't have time to train them, nor take them outside....we're gone all day. <br>  <br>  SOoooooo, now we gotta take them to the local "Shelter".   <br>  <br>  :oP|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Yes, I find that attitude extremely annoying also.

iOJH7SP6aa	Both are great. Ferrets interact more can be litter trained so clean up is easier, and walked on a leash. They need larger pens and need more exercise, and they produce an odor that will never be masked even when de-scented.<br>  Rats are very smart, smaller and cheaper than ferrets. Their odor is less, so handling them can be easier. They don't live as long (good or bad in some cases) They (for the most part) cannot be litter trained. They are dirtier than ferrets and more difficult to bathe.<br>  My opinion tho, i prefer dumbo or hairless rats. Ferrets are high maintenance and they have a long life span which is more demanding.|`|554cbaad408d4cd105322cde412038daaa	Rats!  I have had two and they don't bite and are very playful and affectionate.  They are also cheap and easy to feed.<br>  The cons of rats are cleaning out their cages, and sometimes they leave little pee trails on you lol<br>  <br>  Ferrets are smelly and more expensive, they need bigger cages and are harder to take care of.  I babysat my friends once and the smell was so bad we had to put the cage in the guest house!<br>  <br>  The pros would be they are really fun and not as easy to lose and they are cuter in a way.|`|UFn9eMYvaa	They're both pretty cool. <br>  <br>  Ferrets stink, though, and are pretty high matience. I've never been bitten hard by a rat... and I've had around 6. I've never owned a ferret, but I know people who have them and they stink up the whole house! And rats are definitely smart and can learn.<br>  <br>  ...IMO, rats are better :]<br>  <br>  edit: I don't know about rats being dirty, mine are always grooming themselves. They even smell nice (well, not the cage)! It's really weird, actually.|`|25e1af43f9a5f89fb4d0499909160c98aa	ferrets are smarter and can learn, rats carry disease and are not very cute.|`|23YPEAqBaa	I am partial to rats.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Rats are very intelligent and highly social with humans.  They bond well and of course don't require a lot of cage space. They have VERY sharp teeth. They like to be with their humans so you have to deal with their excrement as they don't use litterboxes.  They only have a life span of about two years.<br>  <br>  I know nothing about ferrets (except I heard they are "like cats on speed") because they are outlawed in CA.  We never have them in our shelters here and I don't know anyone who has owned one.|`|JgC9a8m2aa	I only have experience with ferrets, so I can't say much about rats. From what I've heard, when it comes to personality, rats are similar to ferrets (not so much the wild and crazy part, just that they can be cuddlers, are very smart and loyal). But again, I've never had rats (have thought about getting some though), that's just what I've heard.<br>  <br>  As for ferrets, I think they're great pets - very loving, capable of bonding with their humans, some are very cuddly, they're fun, fun to play with, funny to watch, and the list goes on. The bigget con with ferrets is the expense - the vet bills can be killer. Ferret food tends to be pretty expensive, too. There's also time - they require a lot of time and interaction from their humans. You can't just lock them in a cage and let them out when you have a spare minute here and there. The cage needs to be cleaned weekly (with some daily spot cleaning and poop scoopin') and they should be let out of the cage at least 4 hours every day (and you need to spend the majority of that time interacting with them). I think those are the two biggest cons (time and money) when it comes to ferrets. Some people will say they stink, too, but if you take the time to do regular cage cleanings and properly care for the ferret, then you shouldn't have any major problems with smell.<br>  <br>  If you're debating between a rat or ferret, then I think the deciding factor will be money. Rats are going to be cheaper to keep and care for than ferrets.|`|CEgq26oHaa	In my opinion, I'd say a ferret.  I have owned them for years and they are very fun to own.  They will keep you laughing, and they love to interact with you.  They are easy to litter train, and not very high maintenance, other than cleaning out the cage and litter box.  I had this ferret one time that used to steal things from us and hide them.  Well for the longest time, I was accusing the kids of using too much toilet paper because we seemed to be going through an entire roll a day.  Then one day I was spring cleaning and decided to move my bed and when I did OMG...toilet paper on the rolls everywhere!  So, Not believeing that the ferret would actually do that, I set a roll on the floor and let the ferret loose. Within 5 minutes he was carrying the entire roll of toilet paper from the bathroom and hiding it under my bed.  I don't know much about rats, but between the both, I'd say a ferret for sure!<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***  If you bath the ferret at least once a month, and wash the bedding weekly, they dont' stink as bad as people think.|`|FhVobWpeaa	In my opinion ferrets are cute and furry<br>  rats well ewww the tails are like  ughhhh<br>  <br>  edit  you asked our opinion... <br>  now you qualify that.. hmmmmm|`|veuIjXq2aa	i think ferrets are better because they don't bite and rats can have diseases.
UFn9eMYvaa	Yup! I did when I was a (younger) kid. Like, they're a little boring but there's a bunch of plus sides to keeping them. The site below should tell you everything you need.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you about finding snails! Go out hunting when it rains. I don't really know... if you have swamps, lakes, or a forest nearby I guess you could try looking.|`|CEgq26oHaa	Yes you can.  when I was little I kept mine in a cardboard box with some grass and a small bowl of water for the snail to go in and out of.  My snail lived for about three years, and it actually had babies!|`|XuhQS9wsaa	Yes. If you are three. I didn't read past the question.|`|554cbaad408d4cd105322cde412038daaa	Sure! Just keep them with a stick and some moss and such.  Go snail hunting at night when it's moist outside near flowerbeds and look under rocks and such.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	Yes.  It would be the same as keeping a bug as a pet.

You don't find many Black & Silver GSDs anymore.  If you're old enough to remember RinTinTin, it is the same color combination.<br>  Are you buying from a reputable breeder? If so, the dog's color will be on his registration papers.<br>  I know I sound prejudiced, it's 'cause I am, but as much as I love all dogs, I think a GSD is the most beautiful animal on Earth. Most reputable breeders don't breed for all white dogs, they are not even allowed to compete in larger bench shows.  Obedience & other field trials are open to all colors.<br>  Sables are beautiful dogs too, darker than a B & T but enough reddishness, no one would mistake them for a Black.<br>  No matter what color the package is, if you purchase a well bred GSD, you'll have a wonderful friend for life.|`|9YyzSkXWaa	It looks black and tan - I was told to always check the puppies ears for what future colors the will be.|`|rBTxIbh0aa	looks like traditional saddle marks to me go to this site <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4germanshepherds.com/coat_colors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4germanshepherds.com/coat_col...</a><br>  <br>  it'll give u the name of the coat with pictures|`|veuIjXq2aa	most of them are brown and black, mostly black,|`|AA11887983	black and tan|`|F08HDRvraa	I think in the breed that is technically known as sable.
BWez86Ldaa	Rats just like to collect things, especially food! Trust me, the first time you clean up their cage you will find food stashes all over the place! :) Then again, some rats do this out of nervousness and in that case, he might not want to be out in the open much right now. Best advice I can give is to let them get acclimated to their new home for a few days, and during this time you can watch how they act to determine what is normal. <br>  <br>  More than likely, he's just doing the normal rattie thing and making a little nest of food and bedding. It's keeps them warm to have a big ball of bedding in a hut, and then he's got a stash of food. That little guy doesn't even have to move except to get some water! lol|`|KToEYmwWaa	He is basically thinking "Im going to take this yummy food and soft bedding and hide it away for later so that my little rat friend doesn't get it first"  Perfectly normal.  My rats are always stealing and hiding things from each other, yet they are the best of friends and love each other very much.  You are in for quite a bit of entertainment with your little guys.|`|sAcQTPkCaa	firstly rats should be with their mother for at least 6 weeks as they need their mothers milk and are normally weaned at 6 weeks, the pet shop or wherever you got them from shouldn't have given them to you till at least they were 6 weeks old. but i guess its too late now.<br>  the stashing food thing isn't a problem he obviously thinks its a good idea to do it and will probably get bored at some point.|`|WMIAv1N4aa	This is because he wants to take the food to his house or sleeping area most pets do it includind hamsters, however if you feed him fresh food then always take it out after 24 hours otherwise it will rot,<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|XurYYreBaa	Our rats do this too. Everybody has their own stash but they constantly raid each other's food too (no matter that the bowl is full).<br>  Our old hairless girl actually brings stuff *to* the food dish if I give her a treat & she doesn't want it right away.  She used to curl up asleep in the dish too.|`|S9jyc95jaa	Yeah, that's totally normal.  Remember Templeton from Charlotte's Web? :)  Rats love to hoard things, especially food.  I have a hard time determining how much food my rats have had, since they almost empty out their food bowl every time I put more in, taking it out and hiding it around their cage.<br>  <br>  They also pile substrate on top of the food in the food bowl.  To hide it, I guess.  Rats are just funny and weird that way.
rYdsywgyaa	Frogs breathe underwater through their skin.  Since their skin is semi-permeable oxygen from the water is transmitted into the bloodstream.  On land, they breath through their lungs.  The chest muscles are not involved, but they breath through their nostrils.  The nostrils close when underwater.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	kinda frogs mostly beath through lungs like people thats why they are amphibians they go from gills to lungs|`|LPFGUjFAaa	they have lungs, but they also get oxygen through their skin.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	They come up to breathe.After they have legs.
p3vjvzRPaa	It could be an infection or something has got stuck up under the skin (it can be easy for a grass seed or similar to find its way up there).<br>  <br>  Another possibility is an allergy.  I had a dog many years back that had an allergy that presented itself through her licking at her feet.  Sometimes to the point where she made the skin raw around some nails.  I've seen the same thing in other people's dogs since then.<br>  <br>  From what you describe is doesn't sound like an emergency, so no need for you to fret too much - he will be fine.   But very good idea to go to the vet so that you can sort it out before it becomes a big problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck with him.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	sounds like an infection or irritation. You will need a topical cream or antoi biotics. good thinking with the vet!

Also like "cookingaburrito" my cat likes to play with me hair when its wet. XP|`|el4DVHqhaa	a feather toy or catnip|`|qZoBg872aa	Well, I think my cats all have favorite toys. Actually, they have lots of favorites. We bought them this toy banana. I think that is a cute toy.<br>  Also those pet lasers too. When you click it, my cat just comes running after it. He loves it alot.<br>  Then there is this chicken, when a cat hits it, or it just shakes a bit, it makes a little peeping noise. Plus they all have got catnip in them, which they probably enjoy the most. Its so cute to watch them swat around the toys, and carry them in their mouth even.|`|LPhML0wpaa	hair elastics or as we call them ''mouse-ee's'' <br>  lol, she'll randomly take them and play with them for hours. running into walls and carrying them in her mouth to drown them in her water dish. x] <br>  shes weirddd...but i love her. :D|`|ld5Vuo1Vaa	My hair when it's wet.<br>  Weirdest thing I've ever seen, but he loves it.|`|iDyRd9Raaa	lol<br>  all my cat does is sleep.<br>  so yeah it doesent have a favourite toy|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Anything that dangles in the air that they could catch!

6SeWCfUfaa	My dog watches tv.  He barks at figure skaters when they spin lol.|`|7yRGUtgMaa	My dog watches TV<br>  I can tell by the way she reacts when certain things happen. <br>  For example: When I would watch animals planet she would bark at the screen at the other animals. But she does sit and watch. she doesn't have to bark.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Yes Leela watches any show with dogs and actually tracks them on the screen and responds to the sounds|`|a6an2aN0aa	My dogs get all miffed when there happens to be a dog barking or making other noises on the T.V., but they don't sit there and stare at it.<br>  <br>  My cat does though LOL!|`|a9e3fcf8acfc59be0e8921c7f0c639b7aa	My dog does not "Watch" tv but he does "See" it and most of my past dogs have done the same.

The dog I have now barks at animals. and does so even with the sound off.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	Yes, my proof is that his head will move with something that is moving n the screen and also he will walk right up to the screen and put his nose to it and move with the things on tv.|`|QEaoW8nUaa	My dogs love watching the tv :)<br>  <br>  Chris D, get a life!!

443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	***SALT***  ....that is the answer.   It's purely the salt on our skin that attracts the tongue of our dogs.  :oP|`|33PwXUblaa	Iggy nailed it!<br>  They look for the salt in us to lick! =)|`|eDySIDPQaa	It is the salt in our bodies is the reason the dogs lick our hands, legs, faces...<br>  <br>  Per American Veterinarian Association, it is the salt in humans bodies that causes our dogs to lick us.<br>  <br>  and if you have just had a rack of ribs, it could be that also LOL|`|GaL66jbQaa	My dogs do that a lot. I think submissive dogs usually lick their alpha's mouth but obviously your dogs can't reach.  This is a guess|`|AA12397986	They taste like Snausages
tWTJ4CSIaa	I know this may sound crazy, but a friend told me to wear my boots and stand in a bathtub with warm water in it.  Something about the water softens and molds the boots to your feet.  It is safe to put them in water too, don't worry.  <br>  <br>  I thought she was nuts but my ariat tall boots hurt so bad that I tried it and it totally worked!|`|vGTzWCjraa	No Arwen is right.  My uncle was an old cowboy and he told me to soak my feet in hot water with my boots on for a half hour each day for a week and the boots would stretch enough for my feet to be comfortable.  It worked wonderfully without stretching them weirdly or staining the leather.  Just dry with a cloth after and make sure you get the entire lower portion in the water.  So that way if you're boots might discolor from the water exposure they color evenly and you don't have spots.|`|epvjO1Ymaa	I agree with wetting leather, its a great way to get it to stretch and mould, make sure its warm/on the cool side cos boiling hot water makes leather harden. but you have to have time to dry them... (dont force dry them that hardens them too) if you dont then just weear them as much as you can, or deal with the fact that you'll have wet boots at the show or whatever lol<br>  <br>  Oh and if you have synthetic boots rather than leather they wont stech much but warm water will help them a little.|`|3pGKx9gEaa	You can buy stuff that stretches leather.  I have some in a red bottle.  Put it all over the boots, and wear them.  It may make your legs throb a little at first, but you must wear them when you get home...the whole time you are home.  Do LOTS of walking around in them.  If you have less time...wear them around under your jeans.|`|0cviGP2Haa	Put this in it every night:<br>  <a href="http://www.german-shoerepair.com/00109.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.german-shoerepair.com/00109.h...</a><br>  <br>  Then when you are done put these in:<br>  <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1-3725&ids=946342254" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1-3741&ids=946342254&bhcd2=1235713037" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...</a>|`|rTSwouqXaa	I just wear mine everywhere I go. That usually gets mine formed up quick...Although I will say that cowboy boots are a little more acceptable to wear around than english boots.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I totally agree with all the posters suggesting soaking in warm water.<br>  <br>  I used to work for the mounted Police, and that's how they stretch their boots too! It takes a few days for the boots to dry out though, and they should be dried naturally, then throughly conditioned.
X6X2jv2Qaa	this is guaranteed to work.  as long as you are consistent and keep at it, i promise you, that you, your dog, and your neighbors will be content.<br>  <br>  first.  make sure he gets plenty of exercise.  it seems like you are doing a good job with keeping him physically stimulated, so keep that up.  also teach your dog that it is not okay to chew your belongings.<br>  <br>  your dog seems to find you and your energy very reinforcing, so when you remove yourself from the environment, it is actually a form of punishment.  step one: find out what his favorite toy or treat is and give it to him before you leave.  avoid being affectionate when giving him this replacement stimulus.  step two: when you come home, you should not make a big fuss about it.  do not punish him if he jumps or barks or comes up to you, but instead, remain neutral and basically ignore him for about thirty seconds.<br>  <br>  take a day to practice these steps repeatedly.  leave the house for two minutes, then ten minutes, then half an hour.. and so on.  small steps are approximations and is a very good method of training and setting up your animal for success.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	try leaving a radio on for some company for him. this helped my little pup!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	He needs more exercise when you are home.  A tired dog is a good dog.  Maybe you can hire a dog walker to come take him out for an hour a day when you're gone?<br>  <br>  Shock collars are cruel.  If the neighbors press, say you're using one and it's not working ... end of conversation.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Well, it may not be the whole answer but it will be a big part of the equation.  Husky's are extremely high energy dogs, and the saying that a 'Tired dog is a good dog" is true.  This dog will need a great deal more exercise and Leadership very regularly. He should be getting an hour plus walk twice a day, and he should be completely able to count on you for that.  He should walk on leash and at heal.  A pack will increase the work load. (Proper dog pack, 10% of the dogs body weight), faster is better with huskies, try biking with him instead.  (Full running on hard surface is bad for the dog, hold your speed to a comfortable dog trot.)<br>  <br>  A tread mill can add an extra bit of exercise but by no means replaces the walk.<br>  <br>  If all that fails to make a difference, a static discharge collar is not near the cruelty issue you imagine it to be, provided you don't abuse it.  One way of abusing it would be to use the collar instead of the exercise.
pRfSBmAQaa	Dogs will sometimes lick their owners to show their submission. They also will lick to comfort you. Your dog might lick you sometimes to get a sort of approval to do something. For example, my labrador licked me this morning when I told her to go to her kennel - she was asking by licking my hand 'is it okay if I don't go to my kennel?'|`|MV1l9yGIaa	I believe it is love and also the salty taste your skin has. They do this to all humans and i do think it could be a salty taste as well as affection.|`|0S27EvfFaa	My dog does the same thing, they like the sweat on your hands and feet, its salty (eww) It is also a way for dog's to greet people.|`|jLNp2Rdvaa	you probably smell and taste like crap so they're trying to give you a bath so you stop smelling like ****|`|rBTxIbh0aa	your domaniant in the eyes of your dog the alpha if u will if u look at wolf behavoir licking is a way of asking for attention/food from an alpha...but ya it also means the puppy likes u ^^|`|gcZCUfeXaa	she likes you, shes greeting you and wants some attention . remember shes a puppy shes like a little kid.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I heard that sometimes they like the taste of salt that is naturally on everyone's skin.|`|dGsIWdP7aa	because she loves you. she also maybe is tiring to pick up your scent more or tiring to figure you out|`|C1y69RyCaa	ya the main reason they lick u is because of the salt on your skin|`|ZwZOmT4baa	She does it for plenty of reasons. Maybe you ate something she likes the taste of. Or maybe she is trying to clean you or she could just be showing you that she loves you.|`|FhVobWpeaa	sort of a greeting.. and yes she is tasting you that is one way of recognizing you.
UtHnh0aHaa	Basics:<br>  A single or combined flow rate of one or more filters should be able to pump all the water in your tank through them 4 times per hour as most good aquarists will tell you. Having stated this, extra polishing of the water is better for heavy wasters such as carp or koi. If you have a really  large tank, more filters (or more points of entry and exit to / from the filter are desirable to reduce the currents and soften the suction to the exits.<br>  <br>  I will point form benefits:<br>  1. The larger the filter media, the more beneficial aerobic bacterial colonies can stabilize on it (as long as it can remain aerated).<br>  2. Redundancy improves water quality.<br>  3. Redundancy improves safety. If one filter were to foul or fail, the other would support aeration and filtering until a replacement could be made (in a day or so).<br>  4. Filter characteristics can be alternated or specialized. In other words you could apply a softener to one and multiple sponges or floss and resin to the other to specialize each filter (one for softening, one for polishing).<br>  5. Heavily populated tanks need a stronger surface current to exchange the CO2 with the O2 at the water's surface. Two fliters can unify this flow more effectively.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that additional plumbing (tubes under the gravel) to extend the pickup points to the other end of the tank will direct the flow from one end to the other but also reduce it. This can be done in ellaborate aquascapes to reduce 'dead' spots where brown algae or anerobic sludge can form.<br>  <br>  I hope this is as complete an answer as you wanted.|`|ElyP5kLMaa	It is depen on ur tank and how much water flowing rate on each filters!!<br>  Yes always better with the filter can circulates more water inside ur tank, but you don't use a shot gun to kill a fly right!!! there a way to math it out!<br>  flowing rate on the fliter(in Gals) / tank size(in Gals) = 5-15 that is baelly the tank will need without blowing the fishes all over the tank<br>  Good Luck and Hope it helps!|`|UFn9eMYvaa	Depends on the type of fish you have and the size. Like others said, too much current is bad. But if you have, say, goldfish, or an overstocked tank, it's definetely a good thing!|`|91TxX375aa	Depending on the size of your tank, you should only need one.  You should ask at the local pet store to make sure, though.  Before you go, measure your tank.|`|P06xsw2taa	depends on the size of the tank.  anything over a 55 g i would use two.  I also like using two heaters on larger tanks.  But if the filter says it can handel you size tank then it is ok to use.|`|KGEDZFpRaa	depends on your tank size, but 2 filters can create a strong current and it`s making the fish hard time since the pump pull them to it..|`|8UZzt5eNaa	if you have a big tank, then two is the answer...but it won't help your electric bill|`|HztIRvx1aa	depends on the size of the tank|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Better, you can't really have too much filtration in a tank. Useless your creating tidal waves with the out flow lol. I would advise double filters for any tanks over 55 gallons. You don't necessarily need two filters, you can get one filter that's rated fro twice that tank size, its the same thing. Good Luck|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Depends. It's better as long as it doesn't cause too much current in a tank (Unless the tank needs it)|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Yes!!<br>  <br>  If you want to replace one of the filters or it broke or something then you have a backup, use both of them at the same time, they will both hold lots of beneficial bacteria.<br>  <br>  Also if you have two filters it circulates more water therefore you don't have to clean the tank as often, you still have to clean it once and a while though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you didn't mention the tank how big is it? if its small you can use two small ones i am not sure what you are doing its hard to answer this you are doing tropical? gosh this is hard.|`|Ti476VHkaa	If its a big tank then its good. If its medium or little you should only use one for it. Also you are spending more money.|`|i2cZDC81aa	It depends on the size of the tank.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	As long as the temps are warm enough that she can digest it alright, you should be fine this time. However, I would feed all smaller crickets or separate them- with too large of food, you increase the probability of impaction (ie constipation) which can be fatal.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	You need to find smaller crickets. They should not be bigger than half of your Geckos head size. This can cause severe problems! You will at least need to separate them for feeding. The bigger Gecko will, sooner or later, stress out the smaller one. They should be separated.<br>  Good Luck!|`|Pq8Zlo3Naa	dont worry mine does that its so cool!!!!!!!!!!! TO BAD I ATE THE GECKO|`|wLgGD63raa	First of all, you need to separate them. Juvenile leo's cannot be housed with adults. You really shouldn't house leopard geckos together as it is anyways. They are solitary creatures in the wild and will live happily on their own in captivity. It is in the best interest in the gecko to live on it's own as there are multiple problems that can arise from housing more than one leo per tank, such as aggression and dominance issues, malnourishment due to one of the geckos not getting enough food, and issues with leopard geckos breeding as a young age which, as you would imagine be a problem. <br>  <br>  As well as those things you also have an issue of not being able to monitor your leo's health as easily as you would if they were housed separately. It is difficult to tell which one is eating or going to the bathroom and it can sometimes be too late before you notice a problem.<br>  <br>  Also, the crickets -do- need to be smaller than the gecko for easier digestion. This is another reason you need to separate them, so you won't have to worry about the juvenile eating the adult's crickets. <br>  <br>  I would also leave the heating pad on, to help with the digestion, because yes, they do absorb heat through their bellies. The heating pad doesn't need to be turned off anyway. I've never had a problem with mine overheating. If you are worried about this, you can buy a thermostat for about $25 and you plug it into the heating pad to keep the temperatures regulated.
pDWrOl8oaa	If she was in heat and out of your sight for any length of time than yes, she could have been bred. There is no way to tell if she's been impregnated until about 4 weeks along. Then they can be seen by ultrasound. It's ok to have her spayed soon if she was just recently bred. The sooner, the better, actually.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	She should be spayed before she's 3-4 weeks pregnant - so do it very soon.  You cannot tell till about 3 weeks from being bred.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Nope.  If she's pregnant, you'll know it in a few weeks.  You really need to get her spayed, I'm sure you'll be hearing that a lot on here.  Hope you have homes for the kittens!

Get something more practical to teach him about collar wearing and only ever associate the collar with positive things.|`|3K2Ahivhaa	I'd say either nanook or axel...but definitely check out those baby name sites that let you search by meaning if that's what you're looking for|`|eznL5Zwvaa	How about sway.I do like axel.|`|OGQu0Eldaa	i love nanook|`|ZS6GHluraa	i like nanook or axel. something not so common : ) my dog's name is Mong. lol|`|SBCqVhOMaa	I don't think I can really help you, I named my dog Bob.|`|KQjBLyU3aa	i like axel for some reason, but chinook seems to fit more.
FhVobWpeaa	either solutiuon would probably work.  Driving to get pellets would give the advantage of more normal feed tiem if sensitive stomache is an issue.|`|DrXWucWpaa	If its just for tonight, then just a bunch of veggies and water would be fine for the night.  You could also add some (sugar free) cereal like corn flakes or wheat cereal of some sort.  No worries.<br>  :)|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I hope you are not out of hay as that should be the bulk of the rabbit's diet.  A couple of tablespoons of pellets a day is more than enough for a rabbit.<br>  <br>  The hay would be sufficient for a few days.  Too many vegetables might cause intestinal problems.<br>  <br>  I cleaned bunny cages at the shelter today.  Each bun got a couple of fistfuls of timothy hay, a very small bowl of pellets (some buns dump those over and don't ever eat them) and then an apple slice a piece and some cilantro (one of their favorite foods).  That's what was in the fridge for them.
ZxLzNWvkaa	you looking around 2000 to 3000<br>  it depends how long they keep your puppy in the clinic.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Every vet has different prices.   My dad's dog had surgery.  The U of M wanted $3000 and my vet charged $800.  Prices can vary greatly.  It also depends on if you are having a canine orthopedic surgeon do the surgery.|`|QEaoW8nUaa	Looks like you will be up for a lot. It cost us $700 just to get some Anti-Venom when my old pup was bitten by a snake. So probably a lot more than that.
xHxKDQ80aa	F1 is the first generation between a serval and a domestic purebred(sometimes a bengal). They are the ones that can reach 20 pounds plus. Sometimes you will see a F2 get to that size aswell :)|`|99iZK5Ixaa	The f1 is the biggest since it has the more Serval in it.
CEgq26oHaa	What I do is put up a gate that the dogs can see through and let them smell eachother through the gate.  If I can see that they are getting along ok through the gate, I will let them together in the same room.  Usually it takes my dogs about 30 minutes to get used to another dog and soon after they are playing together.  Your dog might be happy to have another dog around even if only for a week.|`|ZwZOmT4baa	What i did was i put my 4 week old puppy in my room and put a baby gate in the door way and let my 5 month old puppy sniff him. When it seemed like they were ok and weren't showing any aggrestion. I moved the gate and held my puppy in my hand and let my 5 month old puppy sniff him. It didn't take to long for them to get used to each other. My 4 week old puppy is now 14 weeks old and he loves my other dog. They get along great! Best of Luck|`|0S27EvfFaa	Too many well-intentioned people bring a new dog into their homes expecting that the dog will figure it all out on its own. My number one rule when introducing a new dog into a household is the humans have to know more than the dogs. We have to have basic common sense and be informed about dog behavior before we bring them home. Dogs are able to sense our state-of-mind and confidence levels, and if they sense that we aren’t in control, they will perceive us as weak. What you need to do is drain the puppy’s energy through exercise before it joins the older dog. Until she passes this stage, don’t allow the puppy to be around the older dog until later in the day, maybe 1 or 2 o’clock, after you’ve drained some of her energy. I would suggest bringing the puppy to a place where she can meet with other puppies or adolescent dogs. They will be “vibrating on her frequency” and better understand and match her behavior. Once the puppy is tired out by her new mates, it’s time to put her with the older dog. Be sure to monitor her. If her intensity escalates, take her out of the situation and wait until her energy is drained again before reintroducing her to the older dog.|`|AA11556697	have them meet in a place away from your old dogs territory...restrict where the puppy can go in the house, and pay more attention to your old dog.|`|dPgYjbd8aa	put them both on a leash have have puppy tied to something or have someone hold it and put a leash on the older dog. OR you can let them sniff each other and let the older dog show it around. the older one might growl or something but let them get to know each other but if they start fighting pull them apart and do the first Option|`|MV1l9yGIaa	Very carefully!!!!!!!!!! Older and more agessive dogs may hurt a pup. Try to see how the older animal reacts when you show hm the pup but, keep the pup far enough away and don't let it down on the floor or outside so that the older dog can grab it!!! OHHHHH|`|dGsIWdP7aa	put them near each other for a bit, not standing but about 10 feet apart. then slowly make them closer. if there is growling, then seprate them, and start over.|`|IFd94XDkaa	In my experience older dogs are pretty tolerant of puppies.  <br>  <br>  You really don't have to worry about your dog feeling bad because she thinks she's being replaced.  Dogs don't think that way.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	it pretty much depends on the dog. my older dog is very well socialized and will play with any dog that will let him. but if your dogs not to well with other dogs. have them meet at a park or something. make sure they go from nose to butt dont give them time to stare at each other. if they have time to stare in each others eyes. it could cause a fight. see how they do if they do good than they will be fine. if not than dont let the puppy in the house.
eBEfZO9eaa	Yes, it will very soon learn it's new name.  Just keep using the new name and he will get used to it.  We adopted our dog (we love him!) from the shelter and within days he knew his new name.  Just be really happy and friendly and keep calling him by the new name, especially give treats and he'll learn right away.  Have fun with your new dog!|`|kTBE4dYEaa	i was looking at adopting a puppy a while ago before i got my dog so i've researched this. yes you can change a dogs name, she'll probably continue to come to her old name as well but you can get her to come to the new one too. if it's a puppy it will probably learn faster but old dogs can learn new tricks too!<br>  <br>  with a lot of abandoned dogs they're not trained well so they probably don't answer to their name very well any way. but if they do it would make it easier if you gave her a new name that sounds like the old one. dogs answer to their name but if you call from far away or she doesn't hear you properly she'll catch the general sound and come, so with changing her name this will help but it's not essential.<br>  <br>  good luck! i don't think you'll have too many problems once your new puppy settles in, because the puppy probably hasn't been shown much love once she likes you she'll do her best to impress you and earn your praise so that should make training easy!|`|Q9pp5EgNaa	Depends how old it is. just keep calling it the name you want and it will catch on. fortunately when I adopted my dog, it already had a good name. and yes dogs will also respond to nick names but only if you say it to them in a positive way. like my dog responds to "buddy" when I say it in a happy way if that makes any sense...|`|mU4pXMIeaa	depends on the dog age. I know for me my pups name is ebony and she comes to ebs ebby etc but when we call her puppy we say it really loud etc so its not so much the name but the sound she is coming too. Just keep using the new name and when he/she responds make a huge deal out of it, cuddles treats etc you know the drill!|`|MV1l9yGIaa	If you get a book and read about dogs, they have the mentality of a 5 year old child, i suppose they will answer when called by their name. I have had dogs all my life and think that some are smarter than humans, just like the person who wrote and said DOGS ARE  RETARDED!! I think it's the other way around.<br>  yes, they are very smart. If you know nothing about them you should read and get info before you get one.|`|0S27EvfFaa	Dog's don't necessarily remember their names, they remember the tone of voice you use to say it, if your pitch is the same as the old name they will respond. although if they have had a name for a long time they will start to recognize it no matter how you say it.|`|imIe4gH5aa	it really doesn't matter what you call a dog, as long as it is the same tone of voice, it won't know any difference.|`|gcZCUfeXaa	U can change the name if hes younger than 4months. And of course they know their names their like people. you just have to get them used to it. but dont confuse them.|`|snqYiVniaa	if u call the name a lot of times it will get use to it and will recognize it.|`|2v3l5Xfiaa	Most dogs believe their name ist "No no no!"|`|1hciyvKdaa	Try to rename it something catchy, singsongy. Pep-si!!!! Tor-ro!!!  Ti-Ki, Something that it attention getting, vs something long and drool would most lilkely get the dogs attention. You can also say the dogs name then your new name together and after a few days drop the old name, and since dogs are really smart it should catch on easily.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	if you change the name they will recognize it very soon. they are very adaptable. and yes they know their names they aren't dumb like most people have thought. they know when you are calling them and they will answer by their names but most importatnly if you call them another name butthey know its them they want to be with you they will come but names are improtatnt.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	When our dogs were Pups they both responded to "pup pup pup" because thats what the breeders referred to them as. When we trained them some commands we used there proper names Demon and Titan my sister is the only one that calls them by their actual names but my Mum Dad and Myself use nicknames like Deeds, D, Tighty Whitey Denem, Tighty, Titsy (so mean!) etc and they still respond. When we use Demon and Titan they look more alert and come to us in alert mode as apposed to 'oh, its you' mode. They also both come to the sound of a whistle and the word "Here"<br>  <br>  So i think they'll answer to anything that you use consistantly with them, you name the dog Brian but keep calling him Brian or Dog it will learn to associate them as their name, like people do with their own nicknames|`|qgeI6Chxaa	It usually isn't too difficult to rename a dog, but it might take some time. Dogs do know their names, but they also respond to the tone of your voice and body language.|`|GaL66jbQaa	It just takes training he might not forget his old name.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	yes its very easy to change there name|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You can teach your dog a new name.  He's not overly attached to the first one.  A dogs name is more like a command than anything else.  Or should be ... when I say my dogs name, he looks at me, because that's what I've trained him to do.  He hears his name and looks because he knows another command will follow that.<br>  <br>  Dogs often respond to the owners voice, not necessarily what they're being called.  My dogs name is Joey so I wind up calling him Joe and joe-joe (and a bunch of there unrelated nick names like "fuzz-nuts" and pooh .. don't ask).  But he'll respond to those not because they're his name, but because he recognizes my voice and my tone.  They also read your body language so ... there's that too.<br>  <br>  But in any case, if you start using a new name with the dog, it will learn what it means.  Don't know if it will forget the old one, that would depend on how long he had it and if he realized that was his name.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	Just give it a treat when you call it by the new name.  Pretty soon it will come when you call it.  It may take a little longer for it to learn that you are calling by it's name and not just saying, 'Snacks.'  It may still respond to it's old name occasionally, but unless it has a name that is real common that shouldn't be a problem.  If it's old name was TV you might have a problem.  :p|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	My dogs know their names, but I also have several nick names for them, which they also respond to.<br>  <br>  I adopted a Chow at 2 1/2 years old.  His original name was Toby.  I REALLY didn't like that name, so I changed it to Blaze.  (as time went on, he acquired a couple of nick names:  Lazer and Lazer Beam) It took him about a week before he knew his new name.|`|FhVobWpeaa	You can change the dogs name.. it will take a while to start to associate itself to that name but eventually it will sink in.  If you know the original name you can speed the process by sayying the old name followed by the new name then after a few weeks just drop the old name.|`|u0JCNh8zaa	Our cat is a rescue and we picked a name that she had no way of associating it with whatever her old name was.  But there are a few things she answers to.  But we call her like 3 different things (we have baby names for her)  But she knows when we are talking to her and pretty much what we want when we say it.|`|CEgq26oHaa	Yes, dogs know their name and you can change it.  They will learn it in a couple of days or so.|`|IMussRPQaa	well it will take a while to reeber its new name but if u hate it that much then u can it will remember but wont forget its old name|`|LBg4DNpCaa	Eventually he will learn to know his new name.

pDWrOl8oaa	I work for a vet and we advise owners to keep their newly spayed cats from jumping and playing for at least 2 weeks. Monitor the incision, keep it clean and dry. She should be fine.

The thing is, pets are a lot of work even if its trained, there's feeding, walking, etc. and you don't want to get a dog and it end up having health problems then worry about a baby and not be able to provide for the dog or something.<br>  <br>  I mean, I hear about people all the time who got a dog or puppy and then surprise comes baby and they can't do it.<br>  <br>  Plus you don't want to get a dog and find out the baby is allergic.  I'd wait until the baby is born and you guys settle in with the baby, then get a dog.|`|zZrKhn9eaa	There are many good family dogs. Of course the labrador is the most common (and one of the best) family pets. They just have hearts of gold and will love to play with your child when he/she grows up. They do chew and eat everything. Labs make "My dog ate my homework" a very true statement.<br>  Huskies have always been a personal favorite. If you're wanting a guard dog though a husky isn't the right choice. They literally love everybody. They're not too big (usually 50 lbs max). And they are also very playful. But you should have at least a 6 ft fence because they tend to explore.<br>  If you like big dogs (and this is a big dog) Irish wolfhounds are very calm and graceful.. especially for their size. Some people might worry about such a big dog stepping on a child, but they really are laid back and excellent dogs. Their fur is kind of wiry.. some people don't like that for some reason.<br>  Scottish Terriers are awesome. They're smaller dogs,but not chihuahua tiny. And they are so cute and have so much personality. Scotties are just great with people period.<br>  Hounds (blood, redbone, black & tan) are great, but they drool a lot. Again though, great with people (not so much with raccoons, lol). They aren't always so graceful though. And they get pretty big.<br>  Some people like jack russell terriers. Personally, I think they're loud and high strung. But I've seen some that were good pets.<br>  Beagles are just wonderful. They don't get really big if you don't want a big dog. They're great with kids, very tolerant. And, well I can't speak for all beagles, but it's not like them to run off like a lot of dogs do.<br>  American bulldogs are another favorite. They're kind of protective.. but  still a terrific family pet.<br>  I can't give every dog an evaluation so a few others that you might consider:<br>  Collie<br>  Curly Coated Retriever<br>  Pug<br>  Golden Retriever<br>  Saint Bernard (that's if you don't mind big dogs)<br>  Corgi<br>  Poodle<br>  Samoyed<br>  <br>  A few to stay away from:<br>  Chow chow<br>  Pitbull<br>  German Shepard <br>  Rotweiller<br>  Dachsund- I know that sounds silly, but they tend to love one person and not get along well with other people<br>  Dalmatian<br>  Akita<br>  Doberman Pinscher<br>  <br>  *Now, to everyone who says that those are just stereotypes and just because those dogs got a bad rap it doesn't make them all bad. Well I agree with that. But sadly, people have been fighting dogs for a long time. Just because a dog doesn't have a history of violence doesn't mean it isn't in his blood. <br>  Read the story about the elderly woman with 4 pitbulls. They were always great dogs, but when one turned on her they all did... and they killed her.<br>  My uncle had 5 dogs. One day he comes home and sees that his doberman and akita tore the little yorkies to pieces. Gross. Those dogs never showed any bad signs... until that day.<br>  <br>  Now to my favorite and most highly recommended...<br>  <br>  A mutt! They're the breed of all breeds. Two dogs in one, what else could you ask for? Mixed breeds are great because you get the great qualities of multiple dogs. Just make sure you have an idea of what kind of mutt. A rotty/pitbull mix is eh, probably not the best for a baby.<br>  Another thing about mutts.. and this is just an observation, it could very likely be false... but it seems like the bad qualities of each breed are canceled out.<br>  For example: I have a chow/ husky mix. Chows can be terribly mean, but they are good guard dogs. Huskies are super friendly, even to burglars. So my dog turned out like a really friendly dog that loves kids, but hates UPS guys.<br>  And if you adopt a mutt, well come on... that's like adopting a kid. Now there's one less sad puppy sitting in a stinky kennel. And it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars like any purebred puppy would. (Yeah, they get expensive).<br>  <br>  This site might be of some assistance also:<br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I agree with Kelsey about Newfoundlands!

He still a puppy too, and i know it sounds crazy because he is a dog, but it could be from growing also.|`|B95Jmf9naa	My Boston constantly had the hiccups when she was that age.

x8Vgu6acaa	At my local shelter about 1/3 of the dogs there are purebreds.  <br>  I myself have adopted 2 purebreds from shelters.  I have also adopted mutts from shelters.<br>  <br>  Sometimes purebreds are mis identified as mixes.  And you are correct,  Mixes and purebreds are equally beautiful, intellegent and lovable.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Because that statement is false. Purebred most certainly end up at shelters. Right now out of 13 dogs...four of ours are purebred at our shelter. And just last week we had two more, but they were euthanized/adopted out.<br>  <br>  Many people don't see purebreds because they are adopted out quickly. It's also why many people assume all shelter dogs have behavioral issues, because the ones that don't are scooped up quick and the ones that do stick around for awhile.<br>  <br>  Mixed breeds end up at shelters more often because ALL of them are bred by irresponsible people who don't look into the homes their puppies are going to. We even have a "Morkie" right now who has small eye, a genetic defect that could have been prevented had the parents not been bred together. And who was the little dog sold to? A 16 year old girl who allowed the dog to piss/crap wherever it wanted, develop a serious eye infection and become matted to hell. I hate people.|`|33PwXUblaa	Purebreds are known for the standards of the breed and people assume they are better!<br>  Soime people also think purebreds are smarter and cuter and better!<br>  Purebreds do end up in shelters but are adopted easily!<br>  FOR SOME REASON! =)|`|Bw18seFqaa	purebreds do end up in shelters.. but they are often adopted out more easily, or a breed-specific rescue group ussually pulls them from the shelter.|`|AA11026827	There are plenty of purebreds in shelters.  Lots of times breed rescues will take the purebreds though.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Are you kidding? There plenty of purebreds in shelters!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Pure breds DO end up in the shelters!<br>  <br>  The majority of purebreds from responsible breeders do not end up in shelters because these good breeders often require a contract that the owner will return the dog to them should they decide to not keep it (but I said majority, b/c things may happen such as a run away dog or someone that just completely ignores the contract.)<br>  <br>  But that's a small percetage of breeders.  Most really don't care about the dogs they are producing or the people they sell them to.  And THOSE are the purebreds that will end up sitting in shelters.<br>  <br>  *I adopted a purebred lab from the city pound....and he wasn't the only PB sitting in there.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	For some reason, many people think that purebred dogs are "better".  They would rather pay money for a dog than adopt one that really needs a home.  They get certain breeds because they think they are cool, or cute, or somehow suit their needs.  Mixed breed dogs just aren't "good enough" for some people.  What people don't realize is that dogs are dogs, and all dogs are loving and loyal, and wonderful companions.  They don't have to be a specific breed to make a great pet and a wonderful friend.<br>  <br>  Also, if people have purebred dogs who they don't have fixed, unwanted breeding can occur, resulting in mixed breed puppies.  People will pay a lot of money for "purebred" dogs, and not so much for mixed breeds, so those end up in shelters.  Can't make much money selling Heinz dogs.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	What?  Plenty of pure breds end up in the shelter.  It's just that a lot of pure bred owners and breeders will "rescue" dogs in their breed and good breeders will always take a pure bred pup that they bred back instead of letting it go to the shelter.  No matter how old the pup/dog is.<br>  <br>  People who breed mixed breeds don't make the same kind of commitment to the puppies they raise and sell.|`|OFpl236faa	I know that around here, the rescues go through the shelters and take out the dogs that they think have a chance. For example, the Border Collie rescue goes through and takes out the Border Collies. A lot of the time, they don't get the breeds right for the dogs in the shelter because they just guess. I know that our local kill shelter tries to contact rescues to come and get dogs. Just an idea. I know I've seen my fair share of purebreds.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	there are purebreds in shelters, just not as many. there are so many irresponsible breeders & owners that they just let their once-was purebred mate and have litters that aren't wanted, thus, ending up in shelters. going from one home to another and back to the shelter.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!

People get two pure breeds, breed them in their back yard for profit, and don't watch the dogs.  Puppy mills are often stocked full of pure breed dogs (at least the paper work says so) that can and do end up in the streets and shelters all over as well.<br>  <br>  There are a few reasons you see more mixed breeds than pure breeds in shelters though.<br>  1) Reputable breeders keep tabs on their dogs.<br>  2) People who care enough to pay that kind of money for a pure breed aren't as often going to cast their animal into the streets.<br>  3) There are breed specific rescues that talk to shelters all over and will often get first dibs on a dog of a specific breed (often why you don't see smaller breeds in shelters as well).  People can call ahead about this sort of thing as well and get put on a waiting list.  These dogs won't hit the adoption floor.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, many more reasons than this, but these are the top three reasons that I've always thought were why we see mixed breeds instead of pure breeds in shelters.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	It would be wrong to generalize that Pedigree dogs do not end up in shelter, because some do.  Your observation that more shelter dogs are Mutts is valid though.  Strikes me as simple economics.  Pedigree dogs cost money, hence it's more likely that a buyer has put some thought into the decision and is better informed and equipped to follow through on the commitment.  Mutts are much easier and more likely to end up in a home on a spur of the moment whim.|`|CEgq26oHaa	Purebreds do end up in the shelters, but as another person said they get adopted out much faster.  At a shelter close to me they have breed specfic wait lists for people looking to adopt a specific breed if one comes into the shelter.|`|FbbZxFCbaa	cause people can sale pure breed dogs and get money for them and mix breed dogs you can't sale.so they put them in the shelters to get  rid of them.|`|Nj36OUPFaa	I always see pit bull's in the shelters :(!!!|`|1gbR22CRaa	People spend money on full bloods.

AA11887983	Probably a question for your vet.  Have your dog checked out.  If he has stopped vomiting for now, and is otherwise acting ok,  you can just pick up ALL food and water for the rest of the night.  If he doesn't vomit overnight, you can then start with a few sips of water every 1-2 hours for 6 hours.  If he keeps that down, offer 1tsp of bland diet, like boiled chicken and rice.  Gradually increase the amount and decrease the frequency of feedings throughout the day.  Then the following day you can return to regular diet if doing ok.<br>  <br>  If he is still vomiting, acting uncomfortable or unusual in any way, or you are concerned, find a vet tonight.  If you do not go tonight, and he is vomiting overnight, get to the vet in the morning.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GaL66jbQaa	maybe he's eating too much|`|CEgq26oHaa	Did you recently change his food?  Or, did he eat something he shouldn't have?  Sometimes a dog will do this when they get a change in their diet that is sudden or something doesn't agree with their tummy.  He also could have just eaten too much.  If you ever notice him eating grass, it's a sign that his stomach is upset and he will be vomiting soon after.|`|EyOzAeyraa	He might be allergic to the food you are giving him..... or the food might make his stomach upset..... +++++++ DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOOD TOGETHER!

GaL66jbQaa	I much much much prefer my local training club.  Petsmart teaching "certification" only requires that they read a book.There are sometimes good trainers but it is not consistent.  Ask your local kennel club who they would recommend.  My local training club is people that care about quality training and continuing education.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>|`|fgxajTiBaa	Lots of people will say Petsmart sucks! I'm sure. But honestly as a past employee there I will tell you what I think of it.<br>  <br>  At MY store, the grooming salon had a few people who were AMAZING groomers, one of them I'm sure could become a show groomer. She is known for her handscissor cuts and does a fantastic job. However, we also have a couple in our salon who do suck quite a bit. Petsmart doesn't much care about the quality of your grooming, just as long as you make them money. So it's a hit or miss. If you find a groomer you like you can request them.<br>  <br>  The training at my store is awful. I put my dog through it because I got a free class and honestly if I had paid the money for it I would have been seriously dissapointed. He already knew all the commands that I was taught. The only thing it was really good for was spending some nice one on one time with him and socializing him to other dogs. However, I do know that over in NY the trainer is spectacular.<br>  <br>  Every store will be different, every person in each store will vary as well. Your best bet would be to ask around to any friends/family if they have used the services before and who they liked/didn't like.|`|F08HDRvraa	My daughter worked at PetSmart a few years ago.  The groomers that work there are people hired off the street that are "trained" by a groomer that works there.  The same thing goes for the dog trainers.  I wouldn't waste my money.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	If you get a good instructor, it can be informative for some of the basic training for your puppy and it is a good place to start.  Food and clicker training is utilized and the dogs begin to socialize if they are eligible to do so.  Many of the tasks are fun and enjoyable for you and your dog.  It is, however, a very very basic class.  Dependent upon your goals of your training and what you want to accomplish, you may need to continue with a more advanced group.  It is an OK place to begin, very positive class.   good luck.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Problem with answering here is that the quality of the class is dependent on the quality and knowledge of the instructor.  Since there will be no way to homogenize the dog school world all you can do is try one, and if it's not working for you, try somewhere else.  Furthermore, a lot of time the success of dog school is a function of client instructor chemistry, in other words, the school you hate might be the greatest school someone else has ever participated in.<br>  <br>  The important thing to remember at all times about obedience is that it is not the dog that needs schooling and it is not the dog going to school and it is not the dog that ultimately is doing well or poor.  It is you!<br>  <br>  I hear people all the time saying, "We tried dog school but Rover is not so smart and keeps failing."  Rover didn't fail, the owner did.  <br>  <br>  Find the instructor who best helps you to understand what it means to be Pack Leader and how to Lead, and your dog will turn out fabulous.<br>  <br>  To quote Kilcommons... "Good Owners, Great Dogs"|`|fMRcX2WDaa	they are great! they use clicker training which is scientifically proven the easiest and fastest way to train a dog.

0bYcYz2jaa	Usually about a year old or so.  They are biologically mature after just about 6-8 months, but still are growing.  My brother's cat Frankie got pregnant very young and she is still pretty small (she's 6).

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	My opinion:  Not worth it - not without papers.  Without papers shouldn't cost more than $100.  They are trying to rip you off.|`|XagPxe7Faa	Cheaper is not always better.  Pups are expensive because breeding ethically is expensive.  Breeders have costs they have to cover.  I would wonder if a dog was extremely cheap if any corners had been cut.<br>  <br>  As far as if she is worth it, that is best for YOU to decide.  If you have done your research on the breed in advance, you should have a pretty good indication of this--you should know what constitutes a quality representation of the breed and what qualities indicate a reputable breeder.<br>  <br>  How does she adhere to the breed standard?  <br>  You should be aware of the breed specific issues associated with Yorkies--has the dog had the proper medical testing done to ensure she is not affected by them?  (Specifically, a simple "vet checked" is not good enough any more?)<br>  There are many red flags associated with Yorkie breeders?  Do any of them apply to the breeder you are considering?  (not papered would be the first red flag)<br>  <br>  These are some very basic issues that you should know backwards and forwards if you are considering getting this or any other Yorkie.  If you don't then you need to research them first to better enable yourself to make a wise decision with your selection.  If you are WELL VERSED on these issues, in detail, then you should be able to access the situation for yourself.|`|GaL66jbQaa	I wouldn't if she doesn't have papers.  <br>   <br>   <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a>|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	My personal opinion, someone asking 500 dollars for a "purebred" dog but with NO PAPERS isn't worth it!<br>  <br>  My boyfriend had bought me a yorkie for around that price, in my opinion its ridiculous to ask that much for a dog even with papers. Now if it was a reputable breeder that done health testing and all that, where they actually spent money in the puppies, going beyond " well the pups have papers, had shots and dewormed".<br>  <br>  My advice is go to a local animal shelter, tell them you are looking for a yorkie/yorkie mix dog. Many animals, many adoptable ones are "humanely ethunaized" each year because people go out and buy "papered" dogs, leaving the shelter ones to die.<br>  <br>  They might put you in touch with a yorkie rescue group where you can get a yorkie and you will save a life :).<br>  <br>  That's what I would do anyway. Talk to a local animal shelter tell them you are interested in a yorkie/yorkie mix or see if they can get in touch with a yorkie rescue group. There are yorkies out there that need good homes, that are mistreated and abused by backyard breeders and others. <br>  <br>  I waited about a year or so before I ended up getting my yorkie. He was the best gift ever. Sadly, he was stolen this september. He had papers but without them...people are stupid to buy purebreds without papers. To me, a dog is a dog, with or without papers. I didn't plan on breeding more dogs...why should I when there are so many out there right now!|`|ZwZOmT4baa	There are NO cheap yorkies. Believe me *sigh* <br>  but if they don't have papers for her she is NOT worth 500.00 <br>  they are trying to rip you off.<br>  I bought a yorkie for my mother at petland but he was very very VERY expensive. But worth it! The whole family loves him to death. In my opinion I don't believe you will find a "cheap" yorkie anywhere.

ZxLzNWvkaa	any kind of lizard can bite or be nice.<br>  depends if you piss them off  or not lol<br>  but usually there pretty good!|`|ltIuUBXNaa	1st thing is check out bluetognueskinks.net for a great feeding chart of veggies/greens which are good for them to eat and it also gives a lot of great advice. <br>  <br>  From personal experience, they do bite and they bite hard, my BTS (Yura) was under our tv stand overnight a few weeks ago, while trying to remove him from under it I was bit and he drew blood. He also hisses at me when I reach in to remove him from his tank, but once out of the tank he is happy and calm. Ok, bad news out of the way. For a baby the 20 gallon should last for a while, but as an adult he will need a lot more room. I have mine in a 40 gallon breeder and he loves it, in my opinion a 55 wouldn't work because they couldn't turn around in it well, too narrow for a heavy bodied lizard that doesn't have a good turn ratio. I suggest strongly getting a moist hide to aid in shedding. (take a tupperware with a cover cut a hole in it for him to get in, line it with spagnum moss and wet the moss, you will need to re-wet the moss every other day or so). I am about to switch Yura's bedding to shaved aspen as suggested by the website above. I have him on sand right now and it's not a worry about impaction that has me switching, it's the fact that sand gets in his eyes and his eyes crust over. Before anyone blasts me, I did take him to the vet and I have cream for his eyes, but it continues to happen so I am going to try something else. I had him at the vet because his skin wasn't looking right and his toes had some previous shed issues. We determined that he had a vitamin A & C deficency. He needed 3 weeks of vitamin injections and was told to change his diet up some. To make sure Yura got greens and a hopper. He still doesn't like eating the greens, but if I mix them into the small amount of cat food that get gets wach week he eats most of them. I give 1/4 to 1/2 a small can of moist food. Vet also said if you feed moist food to give cat food over dog food. Make sure that you feed them a pinkie or hopper once a week to help give him all the nutrients that they need (I started out with live prey but he would just kill it and not eat it. So now I get frozen ones thaw them and cut them in half, he eats it right up). Also make sure that you give supplements, I found that he really like the Leaping Lizards Electrolyte and Mineral Supplement (liquid that has papaya extract & tastes sweet)  They drink alot (10 mins or more at one sitting) so make sure that you have a large water dish in the tank. He also likes to drag his body through the water dish. I hope that you continue to do research so your BTS will have a long and happy life (can be up to 20 years if memory serves me) with you.<br>  <br>  EDIT--I also feed him cooked eggs and bites of meat that we are having for dinner (lamb, beef, chicken, veal, etc)|`|8i90ov0Gaa	In my opinion, they are probably the tamest lizard out there. I have owned bearded dragons, and I think blue tongues are even tamer. I've never seen one try to bite. I feed mine low fat canned cat food or scrambled eggs mixed with chopped vegetables and calcium, and they love bananas for treats, which they'll eat out of your hand. The minimum enclosure size for an adult is one with a floor space of 3 feet by 18 inches. Here's a good website for more info: <a href="http://bluetongueskinks.net" rel="nofollow">http://bluetongueskinks.net</a>|`|wLgGD63raa	Blue-Tongue skinks are extremely docile lizards, I have never heard of any of them biting. They have quite the personality too, if you handle them enough they can begin to recognize you and will sometimes associate certain items with food. I have heard many stories about BTS associating the refrigerator with food and will often times, if let out to roam around the room will go and sit by the fridge and wait for a snack.<br>  <br>  There are multiple different species of blue tongued skinks, but the most common you will find in the pet trade is a Northern. They can grow to approximately 24 inches<br>  <br>  Their diet consists of both vegetables and meats. Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and dandelion greens should be staple. In addition to greens, a vegetable mixture can be offered consisting of carrots, squash, lima beans, peas, corn, etc. <br>  Fruits should be offered as well. Insects such as crickets and mealworms are enjoyed, and a wide variety of meats including chicken, turkey, eggs, and rodents can also be offered.   <br>  <br>  Meals can be a 50-50 mix of animal and vegetable matter, or 40-40 animal and vegetable matter, and 10 percent each of fruit and grains. For example, you might provide some cooked ground hamburger and/or a sliced hard boiled egg, and mix that with an equal amount of vegetables. Add a smaller amount of fruit and/or grain, maybe a small piece of banana and a bit of oatmeal. Mix this together thoroughly and sprinkle a vitamin/mineral supplement on top.<br>  <br>  The ratios can vary, but variety is the key to a healthy skink. You can also mix larger amounts together and freeze for future feedings. It's not necessary to use the four food groups at every feeding, but try to include as many different types in each feeding as possible. <br>  <br>  A full grown adult Blue Tongue Skink needs a fairly large enclosure, with a minimum size of 55 gallons kept in mind. Larger is always better, especially for these Skinks. Wood or mulch type substrate works very well, as does carpet. A few branches should be included, however your skink may very well not climb. Provide a hide box at all times for the comfort of your skink. Basking temps should reach over 100 degrees F. The cooler zone should be around 85 degrees. Place caves on hot and cool sides of the enclosure. You will also need to get your skink a full spectrum UVB bulb as this is essential to it's health.|`|nJszzqRCaa	im not quite sure about the blue tonged skinks but i have a blue tounge and he is bout 30 cm long and he eats hamburger mince, crickets, snails, grapes, caterpilars and yeah but Do NOT give them LETTUCE it can kill them :(     :D goodluck
zOU5fNHWaa	If you are trully dedicated to finding your baby you will have to take drastic messures. keep a SUPER close eye on the doors when your family is walking in and of the house. Second ask everyone to leave for a few hours. Then starting closest to the door you choose...start taking **** out side. Small thing first that there is no possible way the hamster can be hidding in..food..trash can, that sort of thing. Ibviously you wont have to empty cabinates that are out of reach for it. but floor cabinates are a must, once emptied search the wall of the back of each cabinate as they sometimes have holes for pipe access. Then start on the funiture. anything with fabric must be thruoly seached as they offten have small holes in the fabric where the seamstris got lazy, usually right on the bottom to. If youve even had a cat you know animals love places like that. You will have to risk spider bite and stick you hands in these holes in the couch and eazy chair Most calmly and slowly as not to scare the little guy who is probably already scared. Keep a bucket close by incase he makes a run for it.Once you are absolutly!!!! setain hes not in there take em out. Its a long slow prosses of elimination. its a ***** but if you can keep consentration and not accidentaly let him out in a piece of ufrniture then you are eliminating all other places to hide. Good luck!|`|QND80n2Saa	lol,sorry not laughing at your story,but i also have a dwarf hampster,well 4,but ive 1 named nibbles too,he escaped before as well...........<br>  anyway.........<br>  you need to put one pile of food in every room & bedding beside it,it may take a couple of days before he should find it.you'll have to keep checking if hes been at any of the piles,you'll notice his poo.............o good luck,theyre such fast little things........<br>  you shouldnt keep dwarf hampsters in cages with bars cos theyre able to squeeze through,you need to get a plastic cage........goodluck|`|kC7U3VK8aa	this happened to me a few years ago, we eventually found him in the wardrobe, he had made himself a nest out of a t shirt which had fallen off the hanger onto the floor, you need to be really quiet and you will probably hear her scratching about , especially at night as hamsters tend to be nocturnal.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	I lost my pet rat once for days and then my dog kept sniffing on the side of our couch.  I could tell he was after something. So I searched in the couch and found my rat.  <br>  So try putting a cat or dog in the house. They will sniff it out.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	my brothers hamster is always behind the dryer or under the frige.  look there.|`|mXJ3xutKaa	trap it nicely|`|swTjhCznaa	just wait.  you'll find your hamster|`|wyAbkG3oaa	My hamster escaped once. A syrian, and they are hard to find, so you need to set a trap. This is how to do it, and it will not harm your pet. Get a bucket, put some sawdust and some food at the bottom. Build up books on the outside like steps. so your hamster will climb up, jump into the bucket for the food, but she will not be able to get back out again. All you need to do is make sure she has a soft landing with her being so small. Good luck. Oh and you might want to tempt her with a small piece of biscuit instead of normal hamster food because they love biscuit.|`|K75OmKHzaa	A cool thing to do is put a bucket in each room in your house and fill it with food - then get a ladder and hook it onto the bucket or small container.  Your hamster will climb up to get the food but won't be able to get out again - that's how I caught my dwarf hamster when she went missing :)<br>  I know your hamster hasn't taken the food that leads up to her cage, but it's possible she's gone exploring.  Good luck, I really hope you find her! xxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|rUGZ15Eraa	she'll come up btw all you ppls above great answers!but i have a trick too honey do you have a friend who has a cat or dog?well i'll tellya my cat found my gecko, sisters snake, and my hamsters alive!i know it it sounds crazy but heres my way:<br>  Let it smell the cage<br>  keep on lesh at all times<br>  no heeling let er' run loose on the lesh<br>  <br>  Tip:<br>  my cat is good but it takes a while cause cats tend to be lazy <br>  dogs are quck all most to quick so keep tight|`|Do7DFmXXaa	What Alice Y said, use that trick.<br>  <br>  Also, your hamster may be near a radiator, since they sometimes try to use them as a water source (pipes), and the obvious heat source. The bucket trick is most likely to work, use that :)|`|3zVz6Vg7aa	I think leaving the food out is a good idea.  You could also try a HavaHeart trap.  That would catch her alive.  I have one for mice and it works well.|`|orWh2mG6aa	When my hamster got out it ended up being in the couch. Our couch was leather and it had that semi see through material underneath. If you have a couch like that shine a flashlight in it. It may be in there. I hope you find it !|`|RIO8DEthaa	Perhaps, set a trap, and or use the game of mouse trap. It will not hurt the hamster but rather trap it and then you can get it back|`|eAhPup5baa	hamsters usually escape into wedges <br>  <br>  <br>  just put litte treats ment for them everywhere around the house and keep a close eye for her.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope you find her honey!|`|qyuOcOGaaa	Try sprinkling flour in your house, up the stairs and in each room. It will leave its paw prints! My friend lost hers and she found it by doing this<br>  hope this helps|`|X0f444TOaa	Under appliances and big objects, fridge, shelving units, stove - anywhere she can hide.|`|VsPcHASnaa	I have a hamster too.<br>  i always find mine either behind the washer or dryer or behind the stove. <br>  hope it helps:)|`|AA11097657	Mine was in the attic.<br>  <br>  She would climb down the inside of the wall and come out near the pipes in the bathroom at night to feed.|`|5efcbc663b7fc36633fcb20f8ab06f77aa	You could buy a humane mouse trap, ita a wox with a door at one end and a switch at the other, when it goes for the food at the end it steps on the switch and the door closes.<br>  <br>  or get a box make a small hole in the top, put soft badding and strong smelling food inside and put a tissue over the hole and make steps going to the top of the box, we did this when ever our hamsters excaped.<br>  <br>  If she is still in the house she should be fine as long as she doesnt chew anything dangerous, but if u put out strong smeling food (penutbutter works great with catching mice) she will be more attracked to that than thins like wires, they are great hidrs so you proberly wont be able to spot her so a trap is your best bet. Also i would get her a new cage.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|z5hrgF45aa	do u have a chimney. mine went up the chimney it was white before came out dark grey after 3 days. i suggest leave the cage open and keep fresh food and water. when the holiday food is over it will return.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	she probably crawled in behind something.  Check behind the washer/dryer, refrigerator, or other large (warm) appliance.  Check carefully of course.  Don't squish her.|`|HIav9sVuaa	well ur just gna have to keep leavig food around the house im sure shes nt outside unless u left the door open she must be still in he house somehwere she cud of crawled into somewhere maybe|`|WBf2V8vSaa	keep looking for her, and do not give up hope.

1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	I have a pair of winter breeches, and they kept me warm down into 30 below weather- the brand is irideon. Kerrit ones are cheaper, but not quite as warm.<br>  <br>  Long johns- I would never wear- I tried that one winter and the two pairs of pants (long johns and breeches) rubbing together when riding tore up my leg, and ruined the long johns quickly. After that winter, I scraped up money and bought a couple pairs of winter breeches.<br>  <br>  Bit warmers- use your hands or keep the bridle in the house, no need to spend the money.<br>  <br>  hand warmers- get in the way of your flexibility- I don't use them.<br>  <br>  as for gloves- ariat winter ones are nice, or get snowboarding or snowmobiling gloves- they are extremely warm (and have grips). Just go to your fleet farm (or tracter supply, or whatever other farm store you have) and pick up a pair- most have a "good to __ temperature" ratings on them.<br>  <br>  If you need all of this cold weather attire, I am assuming that you are doing your work outside- and if it is that cold, the ground will be hard and possibily slippery, which can cause quite a bit of damage to the horse's legs and joints, just from the impact.|`|JFuVm9k5aa	the best underlayers i have is the underarmor "cold gear" they are THE BEST!!!! i wear them and just my jacket and im cozy in the single digits!!!!<br>  <br>  i have about 4 sets of the long sleeves and the pants. it is expensive but so with it. i'd say arounf $100 for one set but really you only need one if you wash them<br>  <br>  <br>  gloves. ariat "ice breaker" underlayer and then the ariat insulated leather riding gloves for riding, for tacking etc. i like the ariat ice breakers and the the carhartt insulated gloves.<br>  <br>  <br>  here are links...<br>  underarmor cold gear<br>  <a href="http://www.sportsunlimitedinc.com/coldgear.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportsunlimitedinc.com/coldge...</a><br>  <br>  gloves:<br>  carhartt...<br>  <a href="http://www.carhartt.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10101&storeId=10051&productId=96565&langId=-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.carhartt.com/webapp/wcs/store...</a><br>  <br>  icebreaker-<br>  couldnt find em :/<br>  <br>  riding glove-<br>  <a href="http://www.ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pcid=8&cid=5&scid=143&pid=239&psid=750" rel="nofollow">http://www.ariat.com/products_detail.asp...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ALSO for socks get something with a HIGH wool content like these:<br>  <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/default.cfm#/Womens/Socks/_/_/305/" rel="nofollow">https://www.smartwool.com/default.cfm#/W...</a><br>  <br>  i also wear a thin "undelayer" sock then the wool and an insulated boot in real cold weather <br>  <br>  <br>  for the hnd warmers..gloves<br>  for the bit warmers, what i used to do when i boarded my horses was make some instant oatmeal and put it in a baggie (sounds gross, i guess) and then use it as a hand warmer until i got to the barm and put it on my bit. its cheap, easy and very effective. it molds to the bit so it gets it toasty. if not there is a herm sprenger on you can buy in the dover catalog.|`|0cviGP2Haa	Go to <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com</a> and order a free catalog they have everything you'll need and more. <br>  You can also order a free catalog from <a href="http://www.smartpakequine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartpakequine.com</a> or just browse the internet and order there.<br>  Hope this helps you out.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I like hand warmers and foot warmers, I use those thin gloves that are spandex and then hunting gloves/mittens. They are gloves that dont have the top third or the finger part and then have a part that covers your fingers, like a mitten. I put the warmer on the top of my fingers in the mitten part so I can hold the reins. There is a leather patch on them and I lunge with them and they seem to work just fine. If you are just lunging, I would wear big warm winter boots with thin socks and another thicker pair. I also wear sweatpants under carhart overalls and a t-shirt, sweat shirt and warm jacket and a warm hat. :)  I live in North Dakota/Minnesota and its cold here. The bit, I usually warm it in my hands or if you bring it home and keep it warm make sure you put it on right away. I usually lunge in a halter but, when I ride occasionally (in the winter) we have a heated tack room (the only heated part on the property) where I can put my bridle to warm up. Hope this helps!
rjtyFbjlaa	I have a 100% inside dog at the moment (I can't really let her out), and I use puppy pads. About 85% of the time she pees on the pads, the other 15% she pees next to pad or somewhere near the pad. You have to stay on your puppy as far as disciplining her and be patient, think of her like a child. You may feel guilty (I do), but you have to show her that peeing off the pad is bad (show her the spot, tell her no, and lightly spank her), and that peeing on the pad is good (show her the spot, tell her good girl, and give her a treat). Also make sure you buy the pads that are scented; something about the smell makes the puppy want to pee on it. <br>  <br>  I will admit that my puppy refuses to poopy on the pad, but I have just learned to deal with it (I keep antibacterial cleaner in the house at all times). I know though that when she IS let outside, she goes outside. You may have to do a combination of outside training and puppy pads to eliminate most of the accidents.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	well I think my husband and I got lucky, Our pup was completely house broke 4 days after we brought her home. We used the potty pad the night we brought her home because she was just too cold outside. She would just huddle up to our feet to get warm. We put it right next to the door. She used it that night and once the next day. But we took her outside every hour and gave her a treat and a good girl when she went. After three days of that she started going and sitting by the door when she needed out and if she needed out really bad she whined to get our attention faster.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Never have and never will.

Just a scheme to push a crap product on people that don't know any better.<br>  Late Entry : dearie, if you don't wanna hear "opinions", just don't ask.

The kitchen of all places...<br>  <br>  It's a lot easier (and so much cheaper,) to just teach your dog to do its business outdoors.<br>  <br>  *I lived in a second story apartment with two dogs.  We adopted and potty trained one while in that apt.  It IS possible to outdoor potty train in an upstairs apartment....I've done it!|`|1StA2Bklaa	In my experience with them, my pup would always pee on the corner, and the rest would get all over the floor.  So it defeated the purpose of them.  It sucked because we bought a box of 100 thinking it was going to work.|`|yQSu7v22aa	I did get them as my father in law used them with his dogs but they didn't help and I gave up on them.  I just had to spend weeks keeping a close eye on my pup and if she started circling and sniffing the floor I got her out QUICK!|`|wSw8xThlaa	With my puppy it was easy they absorbed every liquid and it wasn't a problem until I ran out of them. But buy them they'll do the trick.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I use them for my dogs while I sleep in day.  I work nights so I am asleep all day, so they can't get out.  They do really good with them.  Even my 9 week old puppy, I don't keep him crated, so I will lay a pad down in the room he stays in and 99% of the time he will go on it.  It just saves me from having to clean up some messes.  I didn't even have to train mine they just went on them if they were down. Sorry but not sure why your puppy is not using hers, I have never had that problem with any of my dogs.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Throw them in the garbage and train the pup to eliminate outdoors.  Why would you want to teach any dog that it's OK to potty in the house?  If you start with the potty pads now, you will have a never ending battle when this pup is 2 years old, and still going to the bathroom all over your house.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	They are a waste of time and money, they are a source of confusion for your pup.<br>  <br>  Your dog should be taught from the beginning that the only place to eliminate is outside.<br>  <br>  You will need to take her out 10 minutes after each meal and every 1 1/2 to 2 hours around the clock until she gets the hang of it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	I have never used them, and would never use them..

fOLO4TNhaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  A prong collar has prongs on it that digs into the dogs skin as the dog pulls, while a choke chain tightens as the dog pulls.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	No, a pinch/prong collar looks like this: <a href="http://leerburg.com/fit-prong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/fit-prong.htm</a> and will give the dog a correction that feels like a minor bite from a more dominant dog<br>  A choke chain is just a smooth chain that simply tightens around the neck and can actually cause far more damage than a pinch/prong collar when used incorrectly.|`|GaL66jbQaa	No pinch collars have spikes that point in towards the neck  .  I think both are unnecessary.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	No, not at all.<br>  <br>  A Pinch is built to imitate the natural correction a dog receives within the pack, the nip on the neck from mom or the Pack Leader.<br>  <br>  A choke doesn't invoke that natural primal instinct the dog has to learn what the correction means.<br>  <br>  Either work, on bigger dogs the Pinch, in my opinion, is superior because it's a way gentler correction and less likely to cause throat damage.<br>  <br>  Any training collar requires knowledgeable and responsible use on your part, far more important than your choice of training collars is knowing how to use the leash and make a leash correction in the first place.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No, they are not the same.  A choke chain is a smooth chain that tightens around the dogs neck when it pulls.  A pinch or a prong collar has prongs on it that dig in a bit when the collar is tightened.<br>  <br>  People will tell you all kinds of things about choke chains and prong collars - I have found appropriate use for both.  But, both require skill to use properly and should not be used by people that haven't been taught how to use them properly.

Either way, Google them to see the difference and get some good help on how to use them.<br>  <br>  Basics:<br>  <br>  Choke collar for basic obedience with a strong willed dog, must be put on correctly or it will not only hurt the dog but not work.  Used mainly for teaching 'heal' and used to correct quickly and the leash needs to be relaxed to show the dog it has done the right thing.<br>  <br>  Pinch or Prong collar is for expert training on dogs who have shown some traits that need working out, this has to be fitted to the dogs neck size and needs to be worn with another collar and leash as well, something the prong can 'ping' off leaving you with a loose dog.  They are designed to act the same as 'bite' that another dog would use for correction.<br>  <br>  If you have a dog with issues, please at least ask the assistant at the dog store for advise and help on fitting and using these collars.  They are not for every dog or Owner and need to be used correctly.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|vaEkSkNnaa	Why use any of these types of collars.   If properly trained you should mot need anything other than the usual leather or material collar.   Try putting one of these `prong` collars on yourself and gently give a tug (or like some  ignorant folk do)  give a hard pull and see  what you feel about the use.   It is in my opinion a cruel thing to use.   With proper training you wont need one.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Which twin cities? There are a lot of places called the twin cities, which I recently found out. The one I know of is in MN, but there is one in OH and NY as well :)<br>  <br>  Just search for ____ (your city) and horse rescue. Or your state and horse rescue. They should pop up.<br>  <br>  You can also ask your local humane society- they would know of places nearby as well.|`|wADItPRyaa	You might also ask around at local stables and tack & feed stores. Not all rescues are reputable operations, and you're more likely to find a good one you will enjoy helping out at if you go by word of mouth rather than relying solely on a google search.|`|vGTzWCjraa	Talk to your local animal shelter or google horse rescue and your state.

GSf09ALBaa	The grass being sprayed is not the problem.  That was 3 days ago.  It is safe after 2 hours.  Throwing up and black stool (blood in stool) and 14 years old means he is in serious need of a vet.  Get him there as soon as you can.|`|F08HDRvraa	Definitely take him to the vet.  The problem may be the poison sprayed on the grass, but at age 14, the vomiting may be coincidence and something else may be going on.
tWTJ4CSIaa	Hunt seat Pleasure is just as fancy as english pleasure... it is just judged slightly differently.  In the hunt seat classes, you want literally a "hunt seat"  that is, you want to ride like the hunter riders.  (If you are familiar with hunter jumper flat classes, it is very similar)  In general, it means a more closed hip angle, bring your upperbody forward a bit and sit more foreward (NOT on your butt).  You still want to hold your heels down and shoulders back.<br>  <br>  You also want a more foreward canter (faster and more open stride than the english pleasure canter) and a quick snappy trot.  <br>  <br>  They may also ask you for a hand gallop, at the hand gallop you should extend the canter and ride in a 2 point (like you would for jumping).  <br>  <br>  The horses are judged on their movement as "hunters" (Flat knees, fancy movers etc.)  and you on your hunter equitation as described above.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Hunt Seat Under Saddle (Hunt Seat Pleasure) usually does not consist of going over jumps. It is like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auh_3BEOpSQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auh_3BEOp...</a><br>  <br>  Sometimes it does though, depending on the class. But Hunt Seat Pleasure should always be flat.<br>  <br>  You use a Hunter's Saddle. I'm not sure if you're allowed to use a Dressage Saddle or not, but I'm pretty sure you have to use the Hunter's Saddle. <br>  <br>  No, it isn't like an English Pleasure class. Hunt Seat Equitation is basically like Hunters (Jumpers except not timed) without the jumps. So it's showing off walk, trot, canter, hand gallop, etc. and all the things involved with Hunters just flat. While English Pleasure is more fancy and a whole other class.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Not stupid  :-)   You don't know if you don't ask.   Here is a good article on what is expected.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_seat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_seat</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lec.edu/pdf/equine/events/IEA%2010%2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lec.edu/pdf/equine/events/IEA...</a><br>  Hunt seat is an equitation class.. basically the rider is judged more. English pleasure, the horse is judged more|`|pYF9KnNeaa	You might want to check with who is putting this show on because judges can differ.  But, generally speaking, there is not much difference from western pleasure, other than the tack. Horses are judged on their abilities to be a pleasure style mount. Horses are asked to walk, trot, canter and sometimes hand gallop both directions of the arena, to stand in a line-up, rein-back and possible other movements at the direction of the judge. Your horse should work with a smooth regular gait, a natural willing and responsive headset; not necessarily fully flexed at the poll depending upon breed, conformation and style. They should show a forward - going way of impulsion and conformation consistent with a smooth and sustainable ride such a s a well-sloped shoulder, good pasterns, and a supple back with well-developed hind quarters. The demeanor of the horse  should be  happy and obedient.|`|KeQOHakpaa	hunter pleasure is a class judged on how the horse moves, behaves, keeps it's headset, picks up the correct leads, and it looks like a pleasure to ride. so it literally means what it is. usually you will find these classes at breed shows, and no you will not be going over jumps at all and you won't have to go into a two-point unless they ask for a hand gallop. then you will have you go into an almost two-point. then the equitation class for hunt seat is just called hunt seat equitation. you are supposed to use an english saddle in most of the hunter pleasure classes, but i have been in classes against people showing in dressage saddles and it's fine. so i would look at the show rule book if they have one available and see if they have rules pertaining to the tack for the different classes. <br>  <br>  here's a video of a hunter pleasure class-<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nAbqpjCq4&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nAbqpjC...</a>|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Hunt seat pleasure to the best of my knowledge, is on the flat, which means no jumping. I would bet you could show in your jumping saddle but Im not sure since all the shows I go to have english pleasure and english equitation. Hope this helps!

ITnQEUQTaa	Yay!!!  you said check chain :-))  You are officially my new hero.<br>  <br>  Yes, of course they are a really useful tool when used by someone who has actually done a bit of research.  <br>  <br>  1) They must be placed correctly (chain anti-clockwise when facing the dog) so that it can loosen instantly. <br>  2) They should be the right size (6-10 cm bigger than the dog's neck)<br>  3) Only worn during obedience work and used correctly then.  <br>  4) NEVER leave a dog unattended while wearing one..  <br>  <br>  It is the NOISE of the chain that checks or reminds the dog - not ripping it so hard that the dogs chokes.<br>  <br>  I have attended two different types of training organisations with my dogs over more than 20 years - one used vocal commands and praise, clickers and food treats and the other used verbal and visual commands, praise and a check chain.  <br>  <br>  IMO the 2nd method was far better for both my shelties and staffords. The pups seemed to pick it up more quickly and much less chance of those stubborn staffs just 'tuning out' for the day!!|`|XEbe4Votaa	I'm not a fan of choke/check chains.  <br>  The first problem is that they're quite difficult to use correctly with many dogs (or for most people).  <br>  <br>  I also find that many dogs who need a training collar are not at all suited to a choke.  And, on the flip side, the dogs who do well on a choke usually do just as well on a regular flat collar.  There aren't any cases where I really feel they're necessary - so I don't bother with them.<br>  <br>  Do they work in the right situation? sure they do.|`|Bw18seFqaa	they can be a valuable training tool if used properly.<br>  <br>  No one should use one until shown how to properly fit, put the collar on, and use it...  there is a right way, and many wrong ways, to use a choke collar.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Of course they are okay if used correctly. <br>  <br>  For the people that hate them and find them unncessary.....I'd love to see them train a dominant dog dead set on killing them without using a prong collar! Wouldn't that be a lot of fun?!|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Training collars are not just okay, they just plain make sense.<br>  <br>  You hit the nail on the head, Correctly.<br>  <br>  I use Pinch myself, but have had just as much success with Chokes, I just believe the Pinch to be a more natural device.  Neither is 'cruel', just a training tool.<br>  <br>  No training collar should ever be used as the dogs primary collar, and no training collar should ever be used to tie the dog.  Training collars are for training, put on for lessons and walks, then removed.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	I use a prong collar on my dog and it is certainly used correctly and works great.  We take the collar off as soon as he comes in the house after his walk so it is never left on.  I feel they are great if used properly|`|wJS6O9U1aa	Yes, they are fine, We use one on our biggest dog because she has snapped 3 normal collars and figured out how to do this weird twisty thing to get out of them but, she cant get out of the choke chain.|`|ZwZOmT4baa	I personaly dont use them for my little one's but if used properly they are ok (even though most people don't use them properly)|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Alot of trainers actually recommend you use them. We have them on our dogs because they are the only collars that are designed big enough! But yeah, they're great if used correctly!|`|GaL66jbQaa	Fine if used properly but most people don't use them properly|`|nmercOm7aa	I would rather use a martingale collar. It tightens for any side and releases automatically form any side. A choke chain only works on one side. The martingale also only tightens a set amount so you can't tighten too much.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	They are a valuable training tool if used correctly, both in fitting the chain and the technique used.  If done correctly they are a "check" chain, that is they check (correct) the dog's incorrect response.  If used incorrectly, put on the wrong way and jerked and pulled on, they are indeed a "choke" chain and will have a negative training response.<br>  <br>  My last Obedience dogs were trained using a check chain only.  The male was the Club's highest scoring Obedience dog and the female was the Club's best Obedience dog.  Both of these dogs started their formal training as adult dogs (around 3 years of age).<br>  <br>  Currently I am training my daughter to train our 11 month old Malinois.  He has been through the socialisation puppy classes and now he has started "informal" formal training using the positive reinforcement method solely.  I am also in the process of getting a training harness for him (non-pull Sense-ible harness) as, while he is going very well, when he first gets to class he does pull and he is a very strong 28 kg dog - alot for a 14 year old girl to handle.<br>  <br>  Once he has the commands pretty well down pat and he is mature enough, I will introduce the check chain to "fine tune" his training.  In other words he will receive "reminder" checks rather than "training" checks.
AA11375099	The smartest cat I ever had was a siamese seal point.  He almost was trained to use the toilet, but my other cat refused so he would not.<br>  <br>  My cat now is called Jeff (his first owner named him) he is an orange tabby and weighs 15 pounds.  A few months ago my wife had a mastectomy and Jeff began to curl up next to my wife where she had the surgery done.  He will curl up in a ball and just purrr and purrr.  My wife usually falls asleep to his purring.<br>  <br>  When I go to work, I feel like Jeff is taking care of my wife for me by sleeping with her when she is fatigued with cancer.  I would not want to go through breast cancer without Jeff our loving cat.  He really takes care of us and I believe he was a gift from God.  He will come into the living room when I  am watching tv and  meows for me to come to bed.  He likes us all to sleep together.  <br>  <br>  We are both so lucky!|`|NIYYN6tpaa	My cat takes showers with me and he thinks he's a dog......When he hears a noise he gets up to see what the hell that was......He sleeps next to my head on my pillow weather I like it or not|`|V8rV38yfaa	Like yours but I do not have any other animal ither than my cat.<br>  <br>  It walks as if its the king of the house.<br>  <br>  Its magnificient.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	One of my cats is a haughty old man. He's ruled the roost for some ten years now. At first, he's a scaredy-cat; when we got our dog, he must lived upstairs for months. (The dog is restricted to the main floor.) It was funny; he was frightened of the dog as a puppy who was smaller than he was. Then, all of a sudden, he began venturing around the main floor and lounging on the table. (At this point, the dog was probably about 100 pounds.) Now, he regularly bullies the dog. He gives a "come hither" meow and approaches the dog, so, naturally, the dog turns around and wags his tail and whatsuch. ..then the cat smacks him in the face, meows angrily, rubs his head on the dog's muzzle and licks him. Then repeats the process. He totally toys with the dog, and by now he once again owns the house. If he isn't on my parents' bed, he's monopolizing the kitchen table or the living room love seat. He's very whiny, he's constantly demanding attention, petting, food, so on and so forth. Besides badgering the dog, he doesn't really get into any trouble. He doesn't knock anything down or destroy anything, and couldn't care less about my pet rats. He lives to be served, he can't be bothered with silly things like rodents.<br>  <br>  My other cat is a little deviant. He's about four years old, maybe. Unlike my older cat, he's an avid "fan" of all small animals. He likes to watch the birds and squirrels in the yard. He's restricted from my room without supervision, as I just know he'll eventually try to get his paw through the wire bars of the rats' cage. (And something bad would happen. I'm thinking they'd bite him.) (When he shows too much interest in the rats, I wave the spray bottle. He's only been sprayed with room temperature water a few times, but he remembers.) He hates being cuddled and hugged, but he's still my snugglemuffin. We regularly have to squish him, he's too cute to resist. He's constantly getting into mischief, whether he's knocking over full cups of coffee (a favorite pastime) or worming his way into the cabinets. You can hear my mom hollering at him daily. He never really cared about the dog; I have a picture of him just sitting and glancing at the puppy on the first night home like it meant nothing to him. He does love human interaction, though. He has this cue that he wants to be petted (he rarely meows) in which he does this funny head-dip. It's hard to describe. In the middle of the night, he roams the house looking for us (although we're just upstairs, same as always), giving this deep, soulful, sad meow like we've left him all alone. As soon as he finds someone awake, he rushes over to be petted and loved on. My mom likes to say that he left the womb too early; he just loves it when people form a tent for him under their bent legs, under a blanket. He likes safe, warm, small spaces and if he sees someone with a blanket, he's likely to try to lift it up with his claws and paw at it until someone makes a tent for him.<br>  <br>  My dog is a dork. Most of the time, he's sleepy, lazy, mellow and a great pillow. The rest of the time, he's a booger. You know, begging for food, bugging someone to play, whatever. He typically has very good manners, though. I can't recall the last time he swiped food or objects, despite the fact that we're constantly leaving socks and trash and cups and stuff on the ground, and I often leave food in reach. (Almost everything's in reach, he's tall enough to easily rest his head on all the tables.) Last week I left a plate of breakfast sausages and syrup next to him in the couch, and despite his obvious, slobbering interest, he didn't touch them. He isn't destructive. He doesn't require much energy. He obeys commands well [from me]. I just love his wrinkly, sad face and floppy ears. He's excellent on walks. He's SO happy to see us when we come home, he's so wiggly and elephant-eared and excited, he has to run off to find a toy to hold in his mouth while we fawn over him. He doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body, he LOVES people and dogs and everything in between, just loves. He's also an excellent guardian; if he has reason to believe there's someone or something outside, he's bark, howl and growl like a beast. (Once he actually meets the person, he is so delighted. He just has to make sure they're safe first.)<br>  <br>  My older rat is like a combination of my older cat and my dog. He's fat, lazy and highly food-motivated, like my dog, and very cautious in new situations like my older cat. He's laid-back and soft. <br>  <br>  My younger rat is more like my younger cat, kind of fearless. He has no patience for sitting around for cuddling, he'd rather treat me like a jungle gym. He's incredibly soft and very inquisitive.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	I have one who is a great loving cat, loves to play (especially with your feet) He is a therapy cat, we go around to nursing homes to visit and he is harness and leash trained<br>  My other cat loves me and only me and will not come out if other people/animals are around (except for my other cat)  He loves to be pet (especially while your going to the bathroom, i don't know why)  But is deathly afraid of other people, animals (any could be a mouse he'd be scared) new objects (like me wearing slippers) going outside, this is a big no no, if you want to attempt suicide go ahead and try to carry him out the door.<br>  MY cat who just passed was a lap cat, she loved cuddling and being with you.  she knew when you were on the phone and wanted your attention AT THAT MOMENT she loved strange noises, like my cell phone ringing, and was a very intelligent cat.|`|QaepwQFhaa	My cat is weird.

She sleeps in the bathroom sink or on my face if the bathroom door is shut. She beats up my two dogs, both huge chocolate labs, and she falls down the stairs often, yes, falls. She will wait for you on the edge of the counter for you to get out of the shower and she likes to drink out of the faucet in the sink rather than her bowl. Her favorite toy is the laser pointer, ahh the laser pointer. I'm homeschooled so she will come up on my desk and lay under my desk lamp, usually right on my keyboard. Her favorite treat is tuna juice, when she hears the can opener, she comes running. Wow, I love my cat! LOL. She's waiting for me to make my bed so she can go to sleep, she wanted to say hi first! {{uy7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y7y...|`|LPFGUjFAaa	i used to have a very intelligent black and white cat, scamper.  she killed things like birds and shrews in my back yard, but she somehow knew that all the animals that are inside were off limits. i never had to worry about her eating my hamsters birds or fish, she never paid any attention to them.  even when snowball (parakeet) bit her on the nose.  she died a few years ago...police car hit her...what are the odds a black and white would get hit by a black and white?  we got a new kitten last year.  she is a bit, well odd.  we call her the ninja cat. she seems to be able to defy gravity. unfortunately for my old dog, cockatiel, leopard gecko, corn snake, fish, and chickens, she likes to cause mischief.  <br>  she isnt mean to by bird, but she stares at him for hours.<br>  <br>  wanna see the list?  in my 18 years of life i've had...<br>  fish- 100+<br>  robin- 1<br>  frogs- 4<br>  parakeets- 3<br>  cockatiels- 1<br>  Australian shepherd- 1<br>  black and white cat-  2<br>  guinea pig- 1<br>  mountain beaver- 1<br>  screach owl-  1  <br>  corn snake- 1<br>  leopard gecko- 1<br>  salamander- 2<br>  hamster- 3<br>  dwarf hamster- 1<br>  ring-neck phesant-  4<br>  chickens- about 60<br>  hmmm....addicted much?  ^_^|`|NY4ahjfaaa	Well lets see I have 3 kittens and a momma cat.

When i first got him, he hid in my apartment for like two weeks before he would come out and let me pet him (he was a kitten, and had been raised around people, he wasn't feral) He also howls as loud as possible, like someone is torturing him - except he does it for no apparent reason in the middle of the night when you're trying to sleep. (his favorite time to do it is about an hour before the alarm clock goes off).<br>  <br>  Masaaki really likes water. i tried to get a squirt gun once, to squirt him when he howls - except he LIKED being squirted, and it made him howl more - then he would roll around so you could squirt his belly too. He also waits for me to be done taking a shower so he can climb in the bath tub and roll around in the water.<br>  <br>  I discovered he HATES peanut butter. I used to put some on his paw at night when he started howling, so he would spend his time cleaning his paw instead of howling. it worked, but it also made him paranoid about the peanut butter jar. to this day, all i have to do is show him the jar and he will run and hide (quietly) for a couple of hours.<br>  <br>  Masaaki is a really finicky eater. He will eat cat food and that's pretty much it. he doesn't like half of the cat treats i've tried to give him, i attempted to give him cooked chicken once and he glared at me like i was out of my mind... same reaction when i tried tuna. He does, however, really like popcorn. he will do tricks for it. If i make some, he will come over and roll around and paw at me to try to get me to give him a piece.<br>  <br>  He has discovered that pawing at me is an easier way to get me to pet him - since when he howls he might get peanut butter... so he has started pawing at me and then he rolls around to act cute, trying to get me to pet him.<br>  <br>  Masaaki always hides when anybody comes over (even if it's just the pizza delivery man - he'll hide under the bed for like an hour after the pizza guy has left). For a long time my friends thought my cat was imaginary because they never saw him.<br>  <br>  Then I got my 2nd cat, Akira, who is totally the opposite. Akira likes people, likes attention, likes treats, hates water, loves company (he has spent time flirting with all of my friends. it's funny - he actually does tricks just for my friends to show off when they come over) doesn't howl...  Akira also really likes to dive under blankets and rugs. Sometimes I will find him hiding under a blanket that's been left on the couch. he'll just be under it taking a nap. it's really funny to see his process for getting under them. he'll kind of take this funny running/diving leap at them, shoving his head under the edge as fast as he can, so that he can get under it. He also really loves to chase your toes under the covers when you're sleeping. he hates having his feet touched, but will tolerate it when i clip his claws (Masaaki loves having his feet pet, but will try ANYTHING to get out of his monthly manicure when it's time to clip his claws).<br>  <br>  you would think two wildly different cats like that wouldn't get along - but they're best buddies. they curl up together and nap together, wash each other, play chase, share toys, and chase bugs together. Masaaki will chase bugs for a few minutes, but Akira is the real exterminator. I haven't seen a spider in my house since I adopted him. (i had been trying to get Masaaki to eat them for me for ages before I got Akira).|`|TK1QQSeFaa	Oh my gosh can you say dream question???<br>  <br>  My cat Kiwi is the sassiest girl I know. I wrote a descriptive essay on her for my English class and wrote 6 pages in about 20 minutes. Anyway I'll  try to be brief...<br>  <br>  Kiwi is by my side all the time. In the morning we share cereal and we even get ready together (she is a long hair). She has about 20 different meows which all mean different things and she loooves to get scratched. She has a special bond with my dad and can even say his name when she wants him. His name is Alan and she says "maaaalan" but it's pretty clear :) She also knows the chairman's name and does a good impression of Rod Stewart. Kiwi is fairly overweight but she was that way when we rescued her and she doesn't seem to like diets. Anyway it is typical for my less sensitive friends to make remarks about her weight and when they do she walks past them and sits with her back to them with her tail wagging.. it's quite funny. Finally, at night she sleeps under the covers and licks my hand until I fall asleep :)<br>  <br>  hmmm looks like I'm destined to be an old lonely cat lady... works for me! haha|`|93r3nCM1aa	My cat is a pig. He's not overweight, but he always acts like he's about to drop dead of starvation. And he refuses to eat his food unless I'm watching him. He'll wake me up in the morning by jamming his cold, wet nose in my face and then rub up on my face until I get up and feed him. But once I feed him, he won't eat unless I watch him. If I go back upstairs to go to bed, he'll follow me up there and meow all the way up. <br>  <br>  He knows he's not supposed to get up on the counter, so he'll wait until I'm not looking, then jump up there, and then jump off when I turn back around. Sometimes I'll catch him in mid jump and he does this really weird flip around and lands back on the floor and pretends like he wasn't doing anything wrong. <br>  <br>  He likes sleeping right above my head, and follows me everywhere. He follows me to the bathroom, downstairs, in the closet, into the kitchen, etc. In the morning when I take a shower I leave the door cracked open to prevent steam and he comes in and sits on the toilet and waits for me to get out of the shower and love him (and then he proceeds to jump into the shower and lick the water, which is a little bit weird.)<br>  <br>  And like I said, he's a total pig. His name is Mooch because if you have food, he will do anything to get it. It doesn't matter what it is, he wants it. I've personally had him steal lettuce out of my salad and eat it, simply because he was adamant at eating what I was eating. I could tell he didn't like it, but that doesn't matter. If I'm eating it, he demands part of it.
AA10545740	The picture is bad but little white spots are typically the sign of Ich. I would recommend turning the temp to 86 degrees. That's what I was always taught and what I have done numerous times with my own tiger oscars when they got ich. In the past, salt was actually a last resort. I never added anything more than I had too. The Temperature was usually the biggest contributor. Keep going with the water changes. Your doing good. And BTW, your tiger looks pretty healthy.|`|mFsKnHTWaa	Its sounds like you pretty much have it under control. The picture was a little blurry but yes it does look like ick. Adding salt is pretty much the only thing you can do to cure any fish illnesses worth trying to cure. A lot of the conditions fish get are fungi and salt usually eats it away. You will not see results right away and you have to be consistent with the treatments or he can get worse before you know it (even though it sounds like your on the case already). Well good luck! hope it works out for you.|`|589c0be44e080f2889dcc72588d0ea80aa	i don't know but it kinda looks that way..|`|dD08pRIwaa	It's pretty hard to tell from the pic.

tB7QK6BTaa	There is no magic.  He' acting exactly like a Lab Puppy.  If he gets worse and more problematic it is 100% your fault, training and socialization are your responsibility.  This is not a breed thing or an individual dog things.  The great dog down the street is not a lucky occurrence, it has a great and responsible owner.  That is the commitment, anyone can be a great owner, it means fulfilling the dogs needs.  Walk the dog, train the dog, these are daily commitments, and if they are not more important than any show on the tube, or any phone call to a friend or any computer game... then perhaps being a dog owner is not the best choice.<br>  <br>  Join an obedience class to get started.|`|GaL66jbQaa	<a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>|`|yhDw9Teraa	If he jumps up on ,say "No!" and point your finger at him .Then turn your back to him show no interest .After a minute or two ....doesn't  matter how long as long as it isn't a second walk out and then walk back in happy cheerful.Just repeat,create times for you to practice this method with your dog, this should work on a puppy like that.<br>  Also reward him with treats and say "Good Boy ". <br>  What also would work is a horn ,honk the horn when he jumps or bites.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
pTCcbKeDaa	pretty much any rabbit will be nice if raised correctly. i have two dwarfs, an albino, a flemish giant, and a cinnamon. in the past i have also had a mini rex and a lop. they have all been well behaved bunnies. for your son, you might go with a mini-rex. they are small, do well indoors, and are as soft as velvet! enjoy your bunny!|`|oGVWdnHraa	Rabbits are not great pets for kids, they require A LOT of attention, are very fragile and easily frightened. A rabbit that is stressed/frightened will more than likely attack or he/she could become very withdrawn, neither of which is very healthy for a rabbit. But if you are willing to teach your son not to chase the rabbit or pick it up (because if they kick whilst he is holding on tight, it could break its back, or fall and cause other injuries) and if you allow it to have free roam of your house (keeping them outside makes them VERY antisocial) then sure go for it. <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> The best breed to get would be a Dwarf Lop.

4TcgAVgEaa	Baking soda will not harm the fish (just be sure to rinse it off well!) I usually use it to clean decor once in a while.<br>  <br>  Snails and pelcos do not feed on algae, unless desperate. So do not listen to any algae eater advice.<br>  <br>  Brown algae is nasty stuff that grows in low lighting. Green algae is much more beneficial to the tank (oxygenates the water) It requires lots of sunlight and a powerful hood however.<br>  <br>  I find that a dry paper towel works well on flat leaves, and a bristle brush on smaller leaves. You may not like this, but one of the best ways to prevent algae is to get live plants. They use up the nutrients and gases in the tank, "starving out" the brown goop.<br>  <br>  Either way, your tank will be a bit of work.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just read the top answer. NEVER NEVER use soap. Soap film is practically impossible to rinse completely off and is very toxic to aquatic life. Do not let it near your tank! A diluted bleach solution is ok because it will evaporate entirely.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	It's a huge pain, btu it still seems like a lot less work than having live plants! When I had my aquariums, and I am by no means an expert, I used the algae killing solutions as directed, and also had some snails and Plecos, but when the plastic plants, gravel, etc., still ended up getting pretty dingy, I waited until I was doing normal tank cleanings or water exchanges, and pulled the plants out, and scrubbed them as well as I could, usually with a super scrubby sponge or a toothbrush, first with regular diluted dish soap, then with a very, very diluted mix of bleach and water. Then rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse, until you're sure that it's all rinsed off of the plants, so you don't make your fishies sick! It seemed to work OK in my tanks, and sometimes I even used to "algae-blocking" tabs as well, which made at least a little bit of difference.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Are you using a household light like a reading light or a desk lamp?

Maybe has some Great Pyrenees in him.  Either way, he is the most amazing dog I have ever had.  If he is a mix of either kind, they are very smart and make great family members.  I don't know what I would name him.  My friends tell me mine should have been named cotton ball or q-tip.  He looks like one. His name was Charlie, but I have changed it to Marlie.

zeTGmB3faa	The chances are no more than normal at a year but your concern will be if she can take care of them. Most likely she will, but not all cats have the mothering instinct. In this case you would need to take over their care and feed every two hours and stimulate them for bowel movements around the clock. Start reading everything you can about mother cats with kittens and taking over if mom is not able too.<br>  I hope this is her last litter as it puts a strain on her body and adds to the over population of unwanted and homeless kittens.

Perhaps you should remember the phrase "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"?|`|TJGje2blaa	She'll most likely be fine.|`|oT71QN8Raa	First of all...most cats do not have a mother/other females around to "show" them how to take care of kittens.  They don't have families.  Once kittens are 8-12 weeks old, mommy boots them out.  And they do not instinctly just get pregnant to make up for kittens that die some where else.<br>  <br>  Most cats will instinctively know how to care for their babies.  I did have one cat growing up that had no friggin clue...basically she was worthless...but it had nothing to do with her age.  She was just a dumb cat.  As for the one-year-old thing...I had barn cats growing up who constantly had babies from the time they were 7 months old (not my fault, parents wouldn't spay them and since I was a child, theres not a lot I could do to change their mind) and none of them died while giving birth.  They did however have very tiny babies, but all babies were healthy.  Really, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Cats know what they are doing.

This is not a breed for the average Joe dog owner and if everyone started to get one to copy the President then there would be loads more BSDs out there needing to be rescued.<br>  <br>  Why don't we just keep them our little secret, hey?|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Just because they are the right breed for you doesn't mean they are right for everyone......why do you think there are so many dog breeds?|`|d01EV6npaa	michelle is actually allergic to all shedding dogs so they cant get one. if she wasn't that would be an excellent choice though. good thinking.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I guess its because they don't want one.|`|cSBZQfaIaa	why americans are so stupid and dumb? yesterday i watched on youtube an american girl saying that europe was a country and that they speak french there, then she got scared when she was told that there was a country in europe called Hungary, know you are discussing what DOG Obama should pick...don`t you watch the news? have you seen how bad is your country nowadays? You literally cause me vomits..so futile...|`|SnAsZapMaa	Why doesn't "Obama's" WHAT get a BS?<br>  The apostrophe in that sentence indicates that "the Obama" owns/possesses the next object - the Obama's valet? - the Obama's chauffeur? - the Obama's bodyguard?<br>  <br>  Or did you actually mean "the Obamas", as a plural?<br>  <br>  Anyway, no-one - not even you - can own a "belgian sheppard". There is no such thing as PARDing sheep, and so no breeds were developed to perform it. But there are several genuine sheep-HERDing breeds - the Australian Shepherd* (actually, it's an Iberian Collie), the 4 varieties of Belgian Shepherd, and the German Shepherd Dog. There are also some sheep-guarding dogs that have been given "Shepherd" as part of their name - eg, the Anatolian Shepherd, which is actually a mastiff, not a shepherd.<br>  <br>  And why can't Yanks - especially the ignorant Yanks! - get some balance in their lives?<br>  Next you'll be expecting to vote on who your Governors and Senators, etc, should marry, and which (if any) church they should attend and what they should buy as their private transport!<br>  Nah, let people have their privacy, and let them make their own choices about things in their personal lives.<br>  <br>  No-one in my country cares which breed our Governors General or our Prime Ministers or our Leaders of the Opposition or our Chief Justices own. Most of us know that Britain's Queen owns Corgis - mainly because they have a habit of nipping the Royal Guards. Few know that her father (King George VI) & uncle (King Edward VIII) had GSDs (but the Poms called them Alsatian Wolf Dogs back then), or that before becoming King, Edward was a successful competitor in the English GSD ring and then became patron of its English club.<br>  <br>  A person's choice of pet is a purely personal thing. So personal that I require each person to choose their own pup - and one chap who was 2nd in order-of-pet-choice was so disappointed when the lass with 1st choice picked "his" pup that he left, pupless, convinced that nothing else would do. And then came back and offered the lass twice my price to pick a different pup and let him have "his" pup.<br>  <br>  In addition to which, the pressures & activity of the life of a US President are such that holders of that office should NOT get a puppy until they leave office - even getting a laid-back mature dog while in office is tough on the dog. And few people would accuse any of the Belgian Shepherds of being laid-back!<br>  <br>  And as herding dogs herd and hunting dogs dogs hunt, what do your "rescue dogs" rescue? There is a big difference between a Search&Rescue dog and a rescued dog.<br>  Also, punctuation is hugely important to meanings - a Belgian shepherd and a Belgian Shepherd are not the same thing. Nor is a white house the same thing as the White House.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Why don't you go and get a Boxer?

Birds personalities are much like humans, you just can't tell until you have the bird.<br>  <br>  My experiance with Amazons has been good.  All are very good talkers and with enough attention and love, they are the most affectionate and gentle birds.  Just remember that if you get one, it will be like having a child.  You need to give them a lot of attention and toys.  Amazons, like the Greys and bigger parrots are very inquisitive and are good thinkers.  You have to keep them mentally stimulated.<br>  <br>  If you get a hand-raised one, it should be a fantastic pet.

1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	It isn't necessarily teens- it is the informed vs the uninformed. For instance, the thought of testing products on animals is a bad one and brings up negative feelings. However, if that testing was for a vaccine that could save millions of lives, would they switch their mind? One example would be the rabies vaccine- that was tested out on lab animals first- much better than testing it out first on your pets (or even humans). Another would be every other vaccine you have ever gotten, or that your pet got- they were all tested on lab animals first.<br>  <br>  There are strict guidelines on animal testing- there must be an obvious benefit (ie- harm a few to save a million), and the procedure as painless for the animal as possible. You do not get approved for animal testing on useless things, and most companies that got the bad rap for testing on animals do not test on them anymore because of that publicity (such as cosmetics).|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Because they are misinformed about today's rules and regulations with animal testing and the benefits of animal testing. (Yes, I am FOR animal testing, as long as the animal is NOT in pain and is NOT going through unnecessary procedures.) There are many laws to prevent animals from being in pain, being tested multiple times for the same experiment, etc. A lot of the pictures that you see PETA carrying around during their protests are actually pictures from the 50's, 60's, and even 70's. In 1985, the US government actually passed rules and regulations on animal testing to help prevent pain and suffering in the animals.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Its because we think that it is cruel to test things on animals that could cause them to suffer a painful death. We see animals as cute fuzzy things that need to be loved not tested upon. Not to mention with technology today there should be other ways to test products without torturing animals.|`|v1tePj44aa	Because most of us see the way the world hurts everyday and want to stop it.<br>  <br>  The others are the lucky idiots who just care about the price tag on their cologne/perfume, and where they'll shop next: Aero, AE, A & F, or Hollister?|`|ANiMHgb0aa	because they are killing innocent animals that could have otherwise lived happy lives just because some old lady can have her cherry red lipstick and know for sure she's not going to die just like some animal did so she could have it.|`|iNYDUFdGaa	because they like the cute little bunnies and they dont want them hurt even if its for something good like curing cancer.

He hated baths and absolutely hated the hose. <br>  <br>  So you may just be surprised. If it's hot enough at your vacation house, once she figures out the water cools her down, she may just go for it.<br>  <br>  If not, if your dog likes being around you, you can get into the water, and call her to you. If she trusts you enough, she'll go. :]|`|SBCqVhOMaa	My dog hates being sprayed with a hose and also hates baths.  He loves the lake though.

Please, do some research on the natural habitat of your pet and try to make it's cage as close to that as possible...<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  No need to throw it out, there's plenty of potential pets that it would be great for, take it out and put it away somewhere until you get something that can use it. And in the future, please research your pets needs before purchase... there are many different websites available as well as books that any good pet store should carry for new owners. A few hours or (even better) days spent researching the natural history and needs of your pets can do a great deal towards extending their life-span and making them a happier, healthier animal.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I would not throw it out, Just don't use it for the bearded dragon.

They are REALLY healthy for them and my bearded dragon LOVES them. In fact, he now refuses crickets. If you get lobster roaches, they practically reproduce over night and they don't smell nearly as bad as crickets. Plus, all they need is a container with a screen on top for air, water, food (pizza crust, bread, oatmeal, dog food, fruits, anything), a heating pad, and egg cartons for them to hide in and you are good to go. I know Im not answering your question, but it might give you something else to think about.<br>  I get my roaches at aaronpauling.com. They are by far the cheapest I have found. I got a 100 mixed count of the lobster roach, gave them a few weeks have some babies, and now i have a steady snack source for my beardie. Its a lifesaver and the best part is that if they escape, america is too cold for them and they will just die!<br>  <br>  If you still want to find locusts, the only thing I can do is recommend going to repticzone.com and asking on there. A lot of the people on there are breeders so they are bound to know where to get some.

FhVobWpeaa	This is animal abuse report them to the authoriies immediately.  by not doing so you become an accomplice...|`|IK6FZ5TPaa	Do something about it, but make sure that nothing happens to the animals, and that they have a place to stay if they get taken out of their homes.  And make sure that they are together!  It hurts me so bad when I know that a family is being taken apart, whether its a dog family, cat family, human family, or all families!  But you should at least call the cops and let them know!  The dogs could die, and the poor dogs are probably scared to death being there!|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	I don't think the fact that one of these people are from the south, but regardless of where you live, there are agencies that will take your complaint and deal with this situation.  Animal abuse/neglect is illegal and should be reported immediately.  I just pray they don't have kids.|`|YOb8NPvRaa	That is animal abuse and it's your moral obligation to report it.

Animals are like kids they don't respond well to anger and yelling.  Firm and consistent repeats are what usually do the trick to get them to behave.  If the dog eating the cat food bothers them so much feed the cat in a different area.  I put my cats food up on the dryer while they're eating that way the dogs can't get the food.  <br>  <br>  You should never use a belt on a dog that is not discipline it's animal cruelty and really you should talk to animal control to see what the laws are.  I know that it's hard to interfere with someone else's animals but no animal deserves to be beaten.  As for your dog training you don't have to hit a dog to make it behave.  Try googling "The loved dog" I think that's the name it's a way of painless training taught be a woman named Tamra Gellar she has wonderful ideas that honestly do work.  Good luck and do what your heart tells you.  Remember the dog can't speak for itself.|`|imIe4gH5aa	so you have watched this for a year ? you are just as pathetic as they are. Call the RSPCA NOW and report them for animal cruelty. Videotape it if you can.|`|0cviGP2Haa	Call the ASPCA animal police if you have any locally and submit anonymously or call the cops and do the same. Don't let the animal suffer.|`|Hk8PcUR6aa	This couple has some very serious issues that are unresolved!  If there were children, some of this behavior would be exhibited there too.  To beat and scream at a pet is inexcusable!  They are not "misbehaving" just to get back at the person.  They are simply acting like a dog or like a cat.  I would not be able to witness this abuse without saying something to them.  This is abuse plain and simple.  Do you enjoy visiting with the couple?  Perhaps you could find out why they have pets if they annoy them so much.  And, maybe you could suggest finding another home for the pets.
svrFBaENaa	If you have males guppies in the tank with her, she could be stressed due to harassment. Male livebearers tend to be all over females that have recently given birth. If she doesn't look sick.. no loss of color, no damage to the fins, no open wounds or white patches, then there's not much you can do. Treating for the wrong thing can often be worse than not treating at all.<br>  <br>  Check your water quality, make sure it's good. Take a sample to a pet store if you don't have the testing supplies, they should be able to test it for you.<br>  <br>  If you have enough room in your tank, you could try getting one or two more female guppies to take some of the pressure off her.

nMuDw3Nzaa	I'm sorry, but not liking a rat tail seems kinda dumb. Nothing against you.  Their tails may look wierd but they aren't they actually feel soft. It is like saying you hate bald people.  Rats are too good an oppurtunity to pass up and I really think you should get them but if you don't want them, then You shouldn't get them.  It would be stupid to do so if you decide you don't want them.<br>  Once you get a rat you wouldn't mind their tails.  I mean, when they are crawling on you and it whacks you in the mouth while you are talking, it isn't very comfortable, but you get used to it.  When you put them on your shoulder (or some rats climb there when they want a ride) they normally wrap their tail around your neck if you are reckless, but that is only for balance. If you are careful and they don't feel like they are about to fall off they won't.  Oh and until you get used to it, it tickles when rats ride on your shoulder.<br>  Younger rats have slightly pinker and thinner tails, and softer. When they are full grown their tails look darker because they have darker fur on them, but One of my rats is full grown and I don't think his tail is gross.  If their tails get dirty you can take a clean, unused (and hopefull never used) tothbrush and lightly bath their tail, but don't scrub! their tails are like snakes and if you rub or brush them the wrong way it doesn't feel too good.<br>  <br>  Please don't let this stop you getting rats.|`|nwH5ax40aa	No u don't "clip" their tails, cruel. they need them to balance.|`|IyfspYM8aa	I'm sure that once you had a rat, you would get over the tail.  I actually hated snakes until I met a kid who had one and now I think they are adorable.<br>  <br>  And if you are using a good breeder, they will let you hold the rats and get comfortable with them.  If they do not let you do this, go to someone else.|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	That is so mean! Why would you not want them just because of their tails? They are some of the best pets anyone could ever have! Why did you even get them in the first place if you don't want them now!? Who gives a **** if they have weird tails they're just tails right!? DO NOT clip them how would you like to have part of your body clipped off!? How stupid! I love my 2 boys they are the some of the sweetest animals you could meet!|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Ahhh no dont clip their tales thats mean!!! Its not like clipping your nails their tales have feeling and when its gone they still feel it and they need it for balance to run!!! I would suggest a guinea pig as they dont have any tails.

Of course the breeder would let you play with the rat before you buy it. how else would you know which one to pick? I am sure you would not harm an animal but rats need lots of care and love and how are you to give them that if you don't want to pick it up because of the tail? People may say that rats are dirty creatures that spread diseases but once you meet a real rat you will change your mind. Rats are smart and mine probably is cleaner then my own dog.|`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	rat use their tail for balance and to control their body temperature, if you don't like anything about an animal don't get a pet, you will eventually get sick of him/her and not care for them. Don't get rats, because even if you feel ok when you hold them, you will still get them for the pressure of giving them good homes, find another pet that suits you. Rats are fantastic and I wouldn't trade my ratties for the world, they deserve the best just like every living being. Also, I'm glad you asked BEFORE you got your rats.|`|nNGrfHdTaa	I dont see How a tail is scary But I can understand If u are scared of Rats in general,<br>  The media Says that rats are nasty Little critters that Stink and Spread Disease,<br>  Theese are wild and sewer Rats there talking about,<br>  Pet rats are MUCH Nicer and  are actully Very clean,<br>  <br>  DONT CLIP THERE TAILS THATS MADE ME SO ANGRY SOMEONE WOULD SAY THAT!!<br>  >:[<br>  <br>  I would maybe start if with a Hamster And Maybe get a rat After x|`|Rfj2ULibaa	Unless you want them 100% don't get them.  Period.  End of discussion.|`|BWez86Ldaa	That's kind of silly, but it's alright! Personally I love our rattie's little tails, they occasionally swing them around to get their balance when we pick them up, it's adorable. There's no way I would suggest you get pet rats at this point. <br>  <br>  You can not get a rat's tail "clipped" for any reason other than injury, and certainly you wouldn't intentionally injure a rat to make yourself more comfortable. Rat's use their tails for balance, and when that is taken away it's extremely upsetting for them. Their tails are kind of like our toes, could you imagine losing your toes? It would completely throw off your balance and recovery would be very traumatic and difficult.
Rw7gi86Naa	Cats pupils will dilate for different reasons. Obviously pupils react to light, but they will also dilate when something of interest comes into view, like while they are hunting or about to pounce on a toy. They will also dilate if they are scared or surprised. As the pupils get larger more light, and essentially, more visual information is available to ensure an accurate attack. Our pupils also dilate for the same reasons|`|O71xlcG3aa	I think they are just like our pupils.  They get big in the dark to let the light in and small in the light to keep excessive light out.  But I've never heard that they change due to their mood.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	pupils are large when alert, hunting, playful mad. or it is dark.<br>  <br>  slits when relaxed, or it is bright.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	When my cat gets scared, her whole eye is black...the pupil gets so dilated.

rDl9XR76aa	haha... actually your theme kicks ***.<br>  <br>  totally find the ceramic stuff to shove in there like beer cans and motors and stuff like that (ceramic or plastic! Noooo metal)... Even do the bullet hole stuff that you see on the back of cars... haha... hilarious.<br>  <br>  I think you should fill it with good ole country boy type fish too... like some of the catfish and crawdaddys, shrimp, snails...etc...

Like a leaning one... Picture the movie Cars.. when Mater is at his towing place, the wood framed entrance is about to collapse...

Are you asking about plans to build a fish tank or set up a fish tank?|`|z69rzdJZaa	Use a regular aquarium and build a lopsided wooden frame for it. Hang a pool light over the top and use the proper bulbs in it. I am guessing the sw is salt water?<br>  Ceramic beer cans for decorations.<br>  If you could find a decorative fired ceramic boat motor, that would be perfect in the bottom of the tank, too. Oh, and a ceramic shotgun would finish the decorations. <br>  Never use copper, or any metal that will rust.<br>  Cut yourself a Plexiglas or real glass top to keep evaporation down. <br>  Use some of those bullet hole stickers in the top and on the front of the tank.<br>  I have no idea as to what kinds of fish, but I would put several large snails in, and shrimps or something to live in the beer cans.

I think that the reason they say it's best to wait until the 2nd heat cycle, is because they're a little older & the motherly instincts are stronger.   It may take a while to know if she's pregnant or not.  Count 63 to 66 days from the first time they mated & keep it on record for a possible birth.  In the meantime, make sure she has a high protein, high calcium diet.   I think she may have to be pregnant for a month or more before the vet can tell, but call them & find out for sure.   If she is, keep close tabs on her up in the delivery time zone, for as young as she is, she may not know just what to do.  Forget what you should've or shouldn't had done & just focus on the immediate thing, which is her pregnancy and health.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	"alot of poeple have been saying im a mean person and dumb person because my animals bred together. well it wasnt a planned pregnancy. dogs" "Mean and dumb" pretty much DEFINES unplanned pregnancy  in bitches of any species.<br>  <br>     Animals are not toys. Pets have no right to humane treatment because they are not human.

Ms8b2kISaa	You're pretty much just going to have to wait! Since you took him to the vet, and there's nothing wrong with him, and he is healthy, there's no reason to worry. You didn't say exactly how old he is, but generally speaking, a dog will reach his maximum height by around 6-12 months of age, and then begin to "fill out" to their maximum size, reaching it by 12-18 months of age. My dog is a Pit Bull/Boxer mix (you can see the odd shape already, I'm sure!), and he looked like a deer until he was almost a year old. He was all legs, with the deep Boxer chest, the big old Pit Bull head, and an itty bitty waist. He's since filled out just fine, and now is quite the handsome boy. Give him some time, and make sure you feed him a puppy formula food until he is at least 1 year old, which will also help, since it is fattier and more nutritious than food for older dogs. Good luck!

They will make sure that the dog is well placed. <br>  Good luck!|`|kTBE4dYEaa	my puppy sounds like yours too! you need to remember that dogs need to be mentally challenged as well as physically. right now i bet she's biting everything and starting to jump on everything and oh boy do i know it's insanely annoying! you need to play games with her that mentally stimulate her so she doesn't want to attack everything she sees! this also means she gets to be close to you and she'll learn to love you, which is fantastic!<br>  <br>  try tugging on a rope with her, put a pen in an empty 2L coke bottle and rolling it around with her, get her a soft toy that has a rattle in it. these are the things my puppy loves best. a great way to get my puppy to entertain herself is i have a stuffed toy she likes tied to a rope hanging off the roof on my veranda that is hanging about a hand space above the ground so she can tug on it and jump on it and play with herself while i'm sitting down.<br>  <br>  a good way to get your puppy to be quiet is to play with her so she'll forget what ever is annoying her. also if she whines at night turn a radio on quietly, i think it makes them feel less alone and interests them so they fall asleep, this worked really well with my dog. <br>  <br>  i think what you really need is to spend some time playing with your puppy and let her get to know you. then it will be easier to train her and she'll enjoy being trained because she's spending time with you and being mentally challenged.<br>  <br>  if you know any well behaved older dogs ask if you can take your puppy over for a play date. the older dog will tell your puppy off when she's too rough and teach her what is and isn't acceptable. my uncles dog stayed one weekend with us and since my puppy sits quietly by herself without a problem and she doesn't mouth too hard.<br>  <br>  if you find you still can't stand the puppy take her to a refuge and let someone else have her. the sooner you do that the better so she can settle in somewhere else. i hope i've helped and you try some of the things i suggested. if you want anymore help send me an email.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i forgot to mention in about 2 years she will grow out of having so much energy and become a dog, so don't think all this crazy energy is a perminant thing. and if you need more help take her to puppy school, they'll help you out heaps!|`|LHSrsHIQaa	Well, the average joe would probably tell you, "Well, sell it if you don't like it." But I won't tell you that ;). I had a dog once, and he was SO energetic it was hard to keep up with him. But when you are buying a dog, you have to be prepared for that, and I'm sure (like I said before) you have thought about it once maybe about taking a break from her, but you seem really attached to her. What I would do would be to start taking her to puppy training classes, she might need a little restraint, you know? Usually feeding and walking isn't enough for a little puppy. They're like kids, believe it or not and you need to spend time with them and spread them your love <3 . It seems like you are a busy person from my observation and what I would suggest is possibly talking to a Lhasapoo expert who can help you how to have time for you, and your puppy. Hope this helps!

kR8Ur3Jxaa	time out! It sounds ridiculous but it works. My first recommendation is to ignore the behavior completely, but it that does not work send him to time out. I put my arm out and point to the laundry room and say "time out" in my sternest voice when my dog has done something really bad. He'll walk over with his head down and sit down and wait for me to shut the door. Dogs hate to be shunned from the "pack", it is the harshest punishment.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	This is a dominance thing and indicates that in the dogs mind there is some doubt as to who is the Pack Leader.<br>  <br>  Kilcommons recommends 20 downs a day as just a regular part of a dogs routine, I'm not sure that's necessary, but the advice is relevant, a real simple solution to all such problems is to immediately put the dog into the 'Down'.  The reason I recommend this route is because down is naturally submissive, and therefor is a powerful way to address dominance problems.  But as with all things, constancy is everything, you have to do it every time, you can not accept the behavior one time and down the behavior the next, that would only convince the dog that you were psychotic and unfit for Leadership.<br>  <br>  Never let the dog succeed in getting what he;s after with this behavior, down the dog, when the dog is calm and submissive, then reward with what the dog wanted in the first place.|`|vVZLFPtRaa	Mussel alll the way cheep 4.20 our so Pet SMART .....

JgC9a8m2aa	I'm not going to go into my big spiel on animal testing, so simply put - I only support animal testing when it comes to medicinal testing for humans and animals. I do not support testing cosmetics, cleaning products, and all that other unnecessary stuff on animals. The unnecessary testing is cruel, but I believe that the testing for medical needs is needed, at least until a better way for testing is discovered.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just thought I should add, after reading the above answer, that I do understand how wonderful animals are. I've always had multiple animals in my life since the day I was born. They're family and they mean everything to me. I also lived in the country for almost 20 years, surrounded by farms, open fields, long country roads, and lots of wildlife (not to mention lots of stray cats, which we always fed and even took in all the ones that hadn't turned feral). But I also understand that the animal testing I do support has done some good, and not *only* for us humans. How do you think our vets know as much as they do when they care for our beloved pets?|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Experiments done on animals is okay by me if the animals do not suffer. Within reason, I think that the many lives that can be saved by testing animals makes it a viable alternative to human testing. The day when we have more public testing on humans is not far off. Many people feel that being paid to be human guinea pigs is acceptable already, wait until times are real tough in amurica and see how many people apply to be tested or experimented with.............cheers|`|YiLCxNkCaa	Absolutely. I also think murdering/eating animals is cruel. That's one of the many reasons that I'm a vegetarian.|`|UXfvkl9gaa	well i definitly dont like it and plus they do it on rats and i love rats.they shouldnt risk lives of animals just for use if they like it they should test it on there selves,see what it does to them.|`|K8WKKMLQaa	okay...look lady, first things first most animals are total freeloaders....so i think testing is payment for just living off my income through food and vet bills.|`|Y8jRshiraa	depends<br>  on what yr<br>  doing<br>  <br>  would you<br>  rather have a<br>  100 mice die<br>  of being tested<br>  or 100 humans???|`|vGTzWCjraa	I personally feel that because developers are so quick to buy up farms and open areas to build more cookie cutter housing and industrial parks we have a generation of kids that really have no idea what animals are worth.  Because they havent' gotten to have interaction as easily with animals or be able to drive down a country road and see farm animals and wildlife they are indifferent to animals and don't realize what wonderful creatures they are.  My family has ranched the same area for over a 100 yrs so was brought up to believe in the circle of life theory.  But at the same time to value life immensly.  There are other more humane ways of finding cures to diseases and if scientists are unsure whether a product should be tested on a human it most likely should not be tested on an animal.  <br>  I have several family members and friends that are vegans so understand your point of view.  I too am very disturbed by animal testing.  It's hard to make people like that understand how great animals are.|`|7mB4mGy6aa	Yes I do that is why I am a vegetarian

Is it to see how long the fish will live or if you can create an environment for them.  While you could toss in 5 guppies none will live for very long.  As Lanab stated you need a larger number for a base.  A soda bottle isn't a good idea, however if you must, only two but you really need a small sub filter for water/air movement.

93r3nCM1aa	Sounds like it might actually be ringworm. It's hard to tell without a visual. Ringworm is supposedly contagious, but my kitten had it and none of the other cats got it and neither did I, and I didn't do a darn thing to try and clean and sterlize the house.<br>  <br>  Ringworm is a fungus. It looks kinda like round scabs that might flake off or create little circular bald and rouch spots. I'm not sure about redness and pussing though...hmm.<br>  <br>  Look up some pics of ringworm on the internet, or send me a pic and I'll see. If it turns out to be ringworm you should buy an antifungal shampoo from the pet store and use an antifungal cream or lotion on it (you can actually just use people treatments, since they are the exact same things).<br>  <br>  Here's some pics of ringworm:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petalk.com/tinea-capitis-ringworm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.petalk.com/tinea-capitis-ring...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catsofaustralia.com/images/ringworm-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.catsofaustralia.com/images/ri...</a>|`|53748744cddefdf672838d27d8300662aa	Some possibilities include the following:<br>  Food, flea, or other allergies<br>  Ringworm (contagious to other animals and to people) <br>  Cancer<br>  <br>  At least call the vet and describe the sores.  Even if your cat doesn't have to go in for this problem, now is the time to discuss financial arrangements for any emergencies that might arise while you are unemployed.<br>  <br>  Eating a spider doesn't cause sores.  Some spider bites might, but a brown recluse bite would have killed the kitten.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	call around to local vets and humane societies and ask if they will do a low/no cost visit, explain your situation or make out a payment plan.

You could purchase an antifungal shampoo and bathe him as directed on the product. You could apply miconozole cream for athlete's foot, but you'd have to keep him from licking it off. You could try to talk a vet into letting you purchase some Interceptor. It's a canine and feline heartworm preventive that (studies have shown) will help eliminate ringworm. You could go purchase a blacklight and see if his skin glows under it. If it does than he DEFINATLY has ringworm. <br>  Or, you could eliminate the trial and error and dig up some cash for a vet visit. No, animals don't get long term skin infections from eating a spider.|`|KGEDZFpRaa	it could maybe coz by eating the spider, as u know kitten tend to play with and even eat aything that are strange and not as usual food that we gave to them, they like to explore new thing, once i had a kitten who ate a coacroche, luckily it doesn't give any effect..<br>  i think the best way to heal ur kitten is u should give him milk n be caress by his mother,  the best milk is from his mother but if it doesnt have one, u could try other milk that we give to babies.. cat saliva can cure wounded cat, so let ur kitten lick by other cat or his mother..|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Sounds like it could be ringworm, the other cats may eventually get it if it is or he could have a skin allergy of some kind. anti-fungal creams will work for this but you have to be careful using human medication on animals as we have diffrent PH in our skin to animals and it can make things worse.

If not, try to work out  a payment plan with the Vet for your cat's sake. You owe him that much!  Have you tryed blotting the sores with Hydrogen Peroxide on a cotton pad or cotton balls?  It's a great way to clean the sores & maybe get rid of any impending infection. You can buy it cheaply at the Dollar store. Do this twice a day at least. If you live in an apartment or house that you're renting, call your landlord ASAP & tell him/her about the recluse spider. You coulkd be in danger too!!!!

The same as above.<br>  Give him something better to do!|`|b5SauM1saa	well to get it to stop barking at night, try letting it out for a pee becuz my dog barks at night when he has to pee its only a fact and try it and if it doesn't work, look up how to train your dog tips on google|`|aR6e3WLoaa	i have to be real firm with my dog.|`|VpXrsxGGaa	slap it and give it tough love thats how dogs learn|`|8C3sKueHaa	1. try a muzzle...<br>  2. be strong.. if it does something wrong say NO! and then put it in a crate or empty room alone for a little bit.. or you can get something called bitter apple and spray it on the things that is chews up the taste should keep it away<br>  3. i'm not really sure maybe she's just bored.. so try entertaining her and playing with her more to get her more tired so she dusnt wander off and get into trouble just because she's bored..|`|qtSCHV5haa	put it to sleep not really id just send it obedience school or google some training tips.
rGMv0AMtaa	Eventually.<br>  <br>  The worms feed off of what the cat intakes for their diet.  If it gets to the point where there are so many of them, the cat could starve or slowly become malnourished.|`|FarHrhg9aa	Well the thing is if ur cat is a mice hunter or goes outdoor alot chances are she may get it from other cats or from eating or killing a mice. I recommend you should take a shower for her. If this "round worm" you refer to is called ringworm, (if i am correct) then you should use Bath Salt and apply it on the ringworm or use lime or lemon.|`|pDWrOl8oaa	Roundworms can cause serious issues, tapeworms are less likely. You should purchase some wormer and routinely deworm your pet.|`|DREPOcuGaa	yes they can kill your cat....take her to the vet and he sould have some meds for it|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes it can kill|`|F32uPjAraa	Yes they can be fatal.
0747fea6c45bf75b7874aeb315e68a95aa	The purpose of the shots is to protect him from diseases that other animals may be carrying. You are right to worry about him getting sick. The person you should be asking this question of is your vet. The vet knows what shots were given, which ones are still left, and whether the pup's immunity would be adequate at this point to be out in public where other dogs and wild animals have been.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Just wait!<br>  You never know!<br>  Let him get his next shot then wait 10-14 days for the effect to kick in a THEN it's safe!|`|ZwZOmT4baa	It's very safe for your puppy as long as he is current on his shots. He sure is old enough to go. My puppy loves the park and he is 14 weeks old he is current on his shots and hasn't got sick from going to the park or the dog park. The only problem i have with taking my puppy to the dog park/ park is that we can't stay for long due to the fact that he isn't fixed yet XD<br>  <br>  Your pup should be fine|`|MV1l9yGIaa	NO!!!!! NOt if the pup dosen't have all the vacinations it needs, NO, NO, Never!!!|`|Tnw9Ypl9aa	every once and a while yeah, but make sure he gets enough exercise, like in the house|`|QwRaFHZdaa	I think its okay.|`|C84qyM24aa	yeah its fine|`|b5SauM1saa	im a dog expert and no its not okay because it might get sick so just wait till your pup grows a bit, try taking him out for a walk around the block right now since he's little and after 8 months try taking him out again<br>  <br>  (and when i said 8 months i meant the months (dates) not years of ur dog) <--- just in case u misunderstood lol but of course u probably wont misunderstood, if you need anymore dog tips plz keep in touch, bellajuve@rocketmail.com|`|ixppeOfiaa	Dont let strangers pet him. Unless you want him running up to people and asking to be petted when older. Also make sure he doesn't meet any older dogs as they will try to dominate him since hes young then again don't let him see any strange dogs they may have flies or worse. Make sure hes always on leash. I wouldn't take him unless you want to attract a huge crowd of people asking to pet him.|`|SLov9sJgaa	I think it would be okay to let him go out and exercise. You just might want to keep a close eye on him and make sure he doesn't get into anything gross, or around other dogs. (until he gets all of his shots)<br>  <br>  As long as you are careful and play it safe, he should be fine! :)|`|mU4pXMIeaa	NO NO NO! not until all shots are given and a clearance is given by the vet! i know its annoying cuz you want to show your beautiful pup to the world but its better in the long run if you wait!|`|XbpQkEYlaa	I would probably wait until your puppy has all his puppy shots, and then bring him out on a walk to the park.|`|yhDw9Teraa	No,I would think not .Just wait to get his shots then he is a go.|`|jysSutSvaa	Definitely wait, you never know.  Its better to have your puppy completely protected.
2OL1VFxnaa	my kitten had all the same symptoms.  I took ranger to the vet and it turns out he was one of very few kittens not ready for a solid diet. I had to feed him milk and soft food for a few weeks.  I would try a vet and if you cant afford a vet then get her some kitten milk and soften up her hard crumbles with hot water.  Try this for a couple weeks and if it doesnt work, i would find the monies for the vet.|`|kC7U3VK8aa	i have a three month old kitten and to be honest with you she doesnt have anything like this, i think you need to take her to a vet.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	thats a dealbreaker cute or not.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	eww not normal, go to the vet.|`|swTjhCznaa	that doesn't sound normal.  Ask a vet|`|DjQQosqjaa	hahaha seepage...<br>  <br>  use a cork...|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It could be a parasite or some medical condition. She needs to see a vet.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	go to the vet for sure but sometimes this is because they don't have enough Fibre in their diet. Switch to something with higher Fibre.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Take her to the vet. Sounds like she may have an irritable bowel or colon. Mucus occurs many times due to an irritant, possibly worms or the food she is eating. Don't give milk, fish or organ meats Try canned cat food with turkey or chicken, no gravy and no chunks. <br>  The vet is important because if something is wrong, it will be much easier to treat now than later.|`|AA10313901	Sounds like colitis (in a human it would be called Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS).<br>  <br>  You need to take the kitty to the vet so they can test a stool sample just to be sure.   You may simply need to change her food to a sensitive-stomach brand.   ...Check with the vet to be sure.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	This is not normal call your vet and at least ask about this he may want you to bring kitty in to be seen or kitty may just need to have it's anal glands cleaned out, it doesn't usually happen at that age however.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	POOR BABY...take her to a vet ASAP...also while your there...fix he or she...please =)
Bw18seFqaa	Monkies and Apes are NOT good pets! They may be intelligent.. but that actually makes them very complex little creatures! They may be cute too.. but they are terrible pets.<br>  <br>  Also monkies and apes are not cheap.. depending on the specie, you can pay anywhere from $5,000 to well over 50,000!.. Chimps are one of the more expensive ones to obtain! Not including the costs of permits, shipping, and the supplies you need for a monkey or ape.<br>  <br>  <br>  Monkies and apes are aggressive.. they bite, scratch, pinch, hit, slap, etc.. you cannot "train it out of them".. its part of their social structure and how they communicate. Some primate owners had to be hospitalized because they recieved serious injuries from their pets! It doesnt matter what home they are in.. even people who are experienced with primates still suffer injuries! Even the most affectionate primates are still aggressive!<br>  <br>  Primates are very dirty animals. They cannot be housebroken or potty trained. You cant expect them to keep a diaper on either. They are notorious for smearing and throwing food and poop. <br>  <br>  Primates can also carry very nasty diseases, including HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Tuberculosis, Herpes, etc. Some of these can be passed along from a bite!<br>  <br>  Primates need special care.. they require special diets, stocking up on bannanas will not be enough! They also need routine veterinary care.. and zoonotic vets do not come cheap! They need constant supervision and mental stimulation.. a bored primates can be very dangerous and destructive!<br>  <br>  <br>  These creatures can live well over 25 years.. some live over 40 years, depending on the specie. This animal is a life-time commitment. You cannot just get rid of your primate when you tire of it, nor will you be able to leave it in someone else's care if you want to go on vacation. They rarely adapt to another family, even with someone experienced with primates. Zoos also do NOT take people's unwanted pets.. as they often lack the social skills to integrate them with the other primates.|`|gZrxE2aOaa	lol idk but that'd be such a cute pet if there not all crazy...google it :D look at your local circus listings, classifieds even specialty pet shops.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hope you get a money :D
kC7U3VK8aa	if she hasnt been neutered she may be in season, she could be calling  for a mate|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, Cat meow is talking and try to rely message to you.  Is she meowing near a door or window?  Is she fixed?  If not, that is the biggest reason, she wants to prowl and find a mate.  Getting her fixed will help.  If she is fixed, getting a mate will help.  You can also try playing with her before going to bed.  Feeding her a small food will make her sleepy and time for a nice long nap until you wake up.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TJGje2blaa	She's a looking for a little loving|`|LFeEoHj3aa	UGHH...how old is she? She's probably in heat!!!<br>  <br>  GET HER FIXED ASAP!<br>  <br>  Ways to tell if shes in heat...<br>  <br>  1. She is over affectiate to her favorite human.<br>  <br>  2. She rolls on the ground and howls weird sounds...like a deep meooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww.<br>  <br>  3. She rubs her butt on things.<br>  <br>  4. She sometimes sprays a liquid telling males shes ready.<br>  <br>  5. You see strange toms around your house. <br>  <br>  6. She is always spending her time by a door that leads outside or window.<br>  <br>  7. She'll hump inanimate objects, HAHABABABAHAHA|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	The simplest answer might be that she is indeed in heat, especially if her meowing is combined with efforts to get out, possible spraying (females spray too), and male cats hanging around your house or apartment.  If she is fixed, then there are some other problems that you might want to look into: food and water, clean litter, or some kind of a health problem, like a UTI.|`|6qh6sRX9aa	She's definately in heat. Probably her first one, too. Keep her away from males until you can get her fixed. And do it fast.|`|vLU5f5SJaa	IN HEAT...My cat did the same thing, it will stop but a couple of weeks later itll do it again until you get it fixed|`|YeGw45b4aa	usually cats do this when they are in heat
5TM9P8tsaa	*I never separate mine. But I live out in the country. They all get along fine. I guess it would depend on the amount of chickens, if you cage them up or how big is the barn.|`|rQlzfHqraa	It depends largely on three things. 1) The size of the enclosure as a large one allows the little chicken to keep away from the bullies. 2) Bullies. The larger the flock the more bullies will be picking on the little one. 3) Structures. Structures like a tree that little chick can escape into, a dog house to jump up on, some high grasses or bushes to run around. A half grown chick will be able to fend for itself and the more help from the above the better. They will impose the pecking order on a newcomer.|`|AA10356572	about 5 months.. any sooner and it will be bullied<br>  <br>  here is a great link on pet chickens, it might give you other tips<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pets-Chickens.76299" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pet...</a>
svrFBaENaa	Could be Velvet. It's a parasite that latches on to the scales of the fish. It's usually light brown to yellowish in color. There are several methods of treatment, the easiest being raising the temperature in the tank and adding aquarium salt.. more advanced treatment would be using copper. I do not recommend copper unless you know your math and chemistry as too much of it is highly toxic.<br>  <br>  Good thing is Mollies can handle lots and lots of salt in their water. If you have other fish in your tank, I would make sure they can handle salt as well. I've also heard Malachite Green and Formalin work well against it. You can find that in Quick Cure that you can get at walmart. It's highly contagious and chances are your entire tank is infected even if you don't see any signs of it yet.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	velvet get some meds for it and keep an eye on the other fish<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish
AA10332192	It all depends on the frequency of feeding and the type of food.  Food in a Betta takes about 6 to 8 hours to pass through.<br>  <br>  If you feed large volumes of food multiple times a day (a No No with Bettas) it will defacate frequently.  If you feed a proper amount once daily you fish will go once daily.<br>  <br>  There should never be excess food in the tank, that means you are over feeding.
AA10332192	It is fine is used in the proper low dose.  It will also benefit the fish by reducing its osmotic load and keeping some parasites at bay.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	yeah it is perfectly fine!

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Prices vary, but a general price is about $100 to $200 for a female.  Call your vet and see what they charge.<br>  <br>  My vet charges $125 for spaying and $75 for neutering.  The price is probably a little higher now since that was 7 years ago!|`|bMhBlWRuaa	well if you go to banfield and get the insurance ($500 A YEAR) it comes out to $350 with the medicine<br>  it covers EVERYTHING|`|LSxBwiFSaa	If you think about it, it really doesn't matter.

Each vet is different.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	This is the kind of question to ask when phoning around to local vets. We don't know the answer.|`|kTBE4dYEaa	i suggest calling your vet and asking them over the phone.<br>  <br>  just in case you're worried though i did work experience in high school with a vet and i saw a lot of desexing operations and they're virtually bloodless and totally pain free. i was also surprised at how quick and easy they seemed. i'm getting my puppy fixed when she's old enough and i wouldn't do it if i thought there was anything bad about it. so if you're worried don't be :-)|`|Nhje1U06aa	usuallly $200-$250 . they have low cost programs . I go to my local shelter its called Morris in  and get a spay /nueter   certificate  its only $40 and the dr has  a $10 copay for pain medicine- The only negative is you need to find a participating vet that takes the certificates So far I have had 2 dogs and 2 rabbits done with this program|`|MvOxmKqTaa	Call your local humane society or animal shelter and ask about help paying for the spay. They will tell you where to go for the best price. Congratulations on making a smart, healthy choice for your pet. Good luck!|`|AA10233185	Usually an APL (animal proctective league) in your area will do this for a very small fee.|`|HVGOe7HJaa	well its cost me $250.00 but u can prob with most vets work out a payment plan!
0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	most puppies get worms from the mamas milk. A good breederill provide you with records. you do not have to take the puppy to the vet for worms, they sell worm meds at the local pet store and/or feed store and some walmarts carry meds like that if its in a area where there a lot of farmers. there are meds that will treat all the worms puppies get so buy that one|`|GaL66jbQaa	take her to the freaking vet|`|Mkl0bBmbaa	deworming meds bought at local stores dont work and they can harm a dog , if you just got the dog it should be taken to a vet for wellness check up , take a  fecal sample to the vet with you so they cant see what worms your dog has and treat ,|`|XbpQkEYlaa	You should bring her to the vet and tell the vet everything that has happened.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	they are suppose to get dewormer every two weeks for two months starting at four weeks. go to the vet and get dewormer dont get the stuff at walmart it doesn't work and it can be dangerous.|`|ivejg4whaa	De-worm her right away or she will get sick.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	i would consult a vet and possibly re worm the pup.
ANiMHgb0aa	its a great first show! they are for people who are still learning in the horse business:) they are usually a lot of fun and whats great about them is that you can take the most inexperienced horse out there and have a great time before taking him to a  real serious show. anyways... haha they give out ribbons for your age group in dressage, jumping, or whatever course your going to be in in the show. Good Luck! and i hope you get a blue ribbon at your first show:))|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	A schooling show does award ribbons just like any other show.<br>  <br>  Schooling shows are just shows for beginners.  It is basically a lower level than state or USEF shows, but is the same sort of set-up, a bunch of classes and a judge to determine the best.  Usually the riders are beginners or the horses are young and untrained, which keeps the competition to a minimum (which is good for a first show!)  Most people start out with schooling shows and then work up to higher level shows. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|vGTzWCjraa	A schooling show is a great place to work on posture, hand position, head sets, leads - anything that needs work.  You can ride with two hands and not get penalized.  Take advantage of all the shows like that you can before moving on.  Even seasoned horses and riders sometimes go to work on trouble areas.  They often do give fun ribbons out.  Maybe some tack which is always nice.  You can never have too many brushes or buckets.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	at my barn they have organized schooling shows as a friendly show for students from my barn and another barn down the road. the ones i go to are really low-key you get the kids in jeans and sweatshirts and breeches and show coats, and there are ribbons. the two classes our shows have are pleasure and equitation, but there's a little jumping as well. i don't know if our shows are the same as yours, but it's pretty much a beginner's show to start with before you get to the bigger ones.|`|JZ4vL90naa	well its a "practice" show for novice riders and advanced riders schooling green horses green horses are horses that are not fully trained|`|gbd4PMwfaa	A schooling show is usually smaller and it will make for a good first show. The judge is there to help you and to tell what you are doing wrong and how to fix it. Because it is a learning experience it often doesn't require full out show attire but maybe a polo and clean breeches and boots if you ride English or a polo and clean jeans if you ride western. There are ribbons awarded for whoever did the best in the class.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Schooling shows are training shows- they don't count for year-end awards, but you do get ribbons and placings, just like a normal show (1st, 2nd etc). They are usually a little more lax in judging and tend to give you helpful hints. Schooling shows are also cheaper, which is a huge plus to me :)
tB7QK6BTaa	Advice on getting a Beagle, or any other breed is...<br>  <br>  Do your breed research, know and understand any dogs heredity, make sure you can deal with the issues related to that genetic code.<br>  <br>  For Beagles, they will "Bay", they will "Dig", that's not a bad dog, that's just a Beagle.  A Beagle is a scent hound, and it will want to track, and it will want to let you, the Pack, know it's on the trail, it's found something.  It does this because that's what Beagles do.<br>  <br>  As to dogs and kids, more and more I work with dogs that need remedial attention because of the abuse suffered at the hands of kids.  People don't have very well controlled and disciplined kids anymore, my experience with dogs who come to me because... "It's so aggressive, it snaps at my kids." Is that the dog is perfectly fine, it's the kids who need remedial.  It's got to the point where I don't even like to see a dog go into a home with small kids anymore.  In fact I will not adopt a dog into such homes myself anymore.<br>  <br>  So the question then becomes, "Are your children good with and good to Beagles?"|`|AA11788494	I have a beagle mix and he is the best dog ever.|`|XbpQkEYlaa	In most cases, beagles ARE good with kids! Beagles like being social with humans, children especially. Well bred and socialized Beagles can be very gentle with little kids. But Beagles also enjoy activities like playing with the ball. Always remember though that you have to  learn your child to not disturb the dog when its eating, as they take food seriously or give the dog scraps from under the table because of its 'cuteness'.|`|Nj36OUPFaa	Yep i think they are, my mom got my brother a beagle/ pug mix ( puggle ) shes about a year now and is totally great! Verrry lovable dogs. But she always has her head on the ground when he takes her on walks because they have very good nose's.. kinda annoying but you cant dislike a dog for that.|`|se4oHdTLaa	We have a beagle named Queenie, she let us know very early on that she was gonna be queen..lol. She is the most loving, gentle dog, she is also hyper & a digger. We're lucky she doesn't bark much, usually just when she wants something but never at strangers...she is a little shy. She requires lots of hugs & cuddles & that's just how we love our little queen!<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)<br>  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX...|`|MvOxmKqTaa	Beagles are the product of how they were raised, just like all dogs. My beagle, Taffy, is great around anyone that gives her any attention. Be aware that beagles are baying, digging dogs. Make sure your neighbors are understanding or far away.|`|zQRUo0hdaa	I know that beagles are hunting dogs so they like to catch animals...
9kceDOTraa	This does not sound like something that's in the water to be honest.  This is something hitting a specific species, which suggests to me, a pathogen, OR, you just got a group of genetically defective fry.  Depending on the hybridization odds, or how genetically related the males are to the females, this could be a case of a line too far inbred.<br>  <br>  It would be helpful to know how old this female was that bred, has she bred before, and with who if you know.  I really doubt this is a water quality issue or you'd see it effect the other species as well.<br>  <br>  It's probable that this was just a bad group of genetics is what I'm guessing, because odds are, you do not know how far down the line this bloodline has been inbreed.  Generally, about 4-5 times inbreed, you start to get some genetic defects, and without knowing how closely related these are, my guess is this is just a group that got some bad DNA is all.  Wait and see what happens next breeding.  Keep me posted please.|`|YXJWN2luaa	just curious. what kind of test kit r u using? and did u seperate the two species. and what is the temperature. did u have them close to ur light and is ur light on 24\7? p lease get back to me. i would love to try to. help. hmmm. r u using the test stripes or the.master test kit. and say if ur tests r accuarate. my only guess would be from agression from.the others. the seperater does not provide a lot of space. i watch the baby cichlids pummel each other at work and its usually one particular species . they will usually dart around erratically n die. sorry i couldnt b more help to ya.
Bw18seFqaa	try a cold compress on her teats..<br>  <br>  do not attempt to milk her..   expressing milk only encourages milk production!  Avoid nipple stimulations, as that also encourages milk production.<br>  <br>  Until you can get her to the vet, there's not much else you can do.|`|99iZK5Ixaa	You could try to milk her like a cow. It would get rid of some of that extra milk and make her more comfortable. You keep doing that until she goes to the vet.|`|AA10233185	I would take her to an emergency vet. If you told this vet the one you are scheduled for on Sat. about her condition, if they cared they would of had you bring her in. I would find another vet. Sounds to me like the person you talked to doesn't care.|`|yhDw9Teraa	They can start on solid food because they are 7 weeks old .Though they need their milk and she needs to feed them.All i can say is stroke her while she feeds or keep her happy get her mind off of the pups feeding .
CbMpae1Haa	My dog had the same problem and for my dog it was the food he was eating. My pug has a very sensitive stomach and I basically had to get the all organic dog food. It could get expensive but people usually want to give their dogs the best...and I would rather pay for the food than pay for the expensive medications that the vets decide to rip you off on. My pug also has allergies to most of the dog foods that.s why i have to go organic also. So most likely it's the food, if you change the food and it still continues then there must be something going on in his GI tract. Hope I helped a little.<br>  <br>  J|`|oGVWdnHraa	Imagine if your mother never took you to the doctor when you were sick.....why the hell would you get an animal if you are not going to take it to the vet!!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	She may have a blockage, which is causing the vomiting.   There really isn't a safe home remedy if you don't know WHY she is vomiting.|`|ij0hp4T6aa	Vomiting is usually caused by inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and often happens when dogs eat grass or spoiled food. Uncomplicated gastritis, where the dog is alert and has no fever, is best treated without drugs. <br>  <br>  If vomiting continues more than 24 hours, or if at any time your dog vomits and acts depressed and unresponsive, veterinary attention is needed. <br>  <br>  Step 1 <br>  The digestive tract needs complete rest. Allow no food or water until your dog has gone at least six hours without vomiting. <br>  <br>  Step 2 <br>  Begin with very small amounts of water at frequent intervals. If there is more vomiting, go back to stage 1 for another six hours. Do not be discouraged. The stomach often needs complete rest for twenty four hours or more. Offer water every 15 minutes or so. Give a Poodle sized dog one teaspoonful at a time, a German Shepherd about two tablespoonfuls. Over a period of a few hours gradually increase the amounts offered until your dog's thirst is satisfied. If you wish, give clear liquids such as chicken broth or a little Jell-O. After at least 12 hours, when your dog's thirst has been satisfied, you may begin giving small amounts of food.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bland diet for vomiting dogs<br>  Mix one and a half cups of cooked white rice with one half cup of cooked chicken or turkey meat (no grease, no skin).

A large dog can have as much as a tablespoonful. Over a period of twenty four hours, gradually increase the amounts being fed until your dog's hunger is satisfied. Do not rush things. If vomiting occurs now, you must start over from the beginning.<br>  <br>  Step 4 <br>  The following day, begin mixing the bland diet half and half with your dog's normal food.

If you are talking about the canine teeth (fangs) then yes both wolves and dogs have them.  <a href="http://www.pictures-of-puppies-and-dogs.com/images/anatomy/dog_teeth.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pictures-of-puppies-and-dogs....</a> <br>  Humans have done lots of tinkering with the build, coats and size of dogs but there is no difference in the basic physiology of a wolf (canis lupus) or a domestic dog (canis lupus familiaris).  Canids have 42 adult teeth in their mouth<br>  <br>  This is from <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/changed.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/changed.html</a><br>  Dogs are so much like wolves physiologically that they are frequently used in wolf studies as a physiological model for wolf body processes (Mech, L.D. 2003. Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation). Additionally, dogs and wolves share 99.8% of their mitochondrial DNA (Wayne, R.K. Molecular Evolution of the Dog Family). This next quote is from Robert K. Wayne, Ph.D., and his discussion on canine genetics (taken from www.fiu.edu/~milesk/Genetics.html).|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	All canines have the same number of teeth and formation .In prehistory it may have been the wolves of those times teeth were larger given the prey they have to catch but in general the wolf of today is l can assure you the same as your pet dog except that nearly all dogs need a scissor bite bar a few of the flat faced breeds|`|xJMhQAhfaa	In general all canines have similar teeth configurations and all canines have canine teeth (fangs) used for grasping and holding.<br>  The difference between wolves and dogs are not the teeth, but the bite strength. A wolf has about twice the bite strength of the strongest dog.<br>  Dog around 500-750psi Wolf 1500psi|`|3zv2bbolaa	Domestic dogs have smaller teeth than similar sized wolves.

Dogs and wolves have 42 teeth but the diffrences are very noticeable. Wolves have sharper teeth than dogs teeth.

Just so you know.<br>  <br>  Side reins don't force your horse's head into a certain position, they just provide steady contact on the bit to simulate a rider's hands. You want to use the bottom ring to encourage both horses to come down and reach for the bit.|`|AA10247494	I was going to answer but I see GOODD has posted a great answer so I'll just throw in my two cents worth.... Go with the lower rings for both horses.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I have that exact surcingle... as a side note... I hate it.  Mine slides all over the place.  I have used it with  my side reins and I put the side reins on the lowest loop.

UZYT8eMwaa	If you can maintain the proper temperatures then just heat pad is fine.There really isn't a right or wrong as long as you maintain the proper temperatures, humidity, and light cycle, safely for your snake. You will need a source of daytime lighting which can be provided by using a reptile daytime spot light. This can also provide a source of heat and a basking spot. You may also wish to provide a nighttime bulb (A blue or red ,including infrared) or ceramic heater emitters to maintain the temperature at night without the bright light which would disturb the snake at night. Do not use a white light at night! If using light bulbs for heat, be sure that they are placed in such a way that the snake cannot contact any hot surfaces. You can also provide heat through under tank heaters and specialty reptile heating platforms. And of course you can use any combination of these, if it you need or want to. Be sure to use a thermoregulator to allow for better control over the temperature.|`|Q4pUDkyHaa	Professional breeders keep their ball pythons in rack systems in tubs.<br>  These are heated by belly heat only, and there are no provisions for heat lamps.<br>  Anyone want to tell all the professional breeders that they're doing it wrong? Ball pythons do better without bright lights.<br>  Also, heat lamps make it difficult to maintain the right level of humidity. It's hard enough in a tank, but with a heat lamp overheat, it's much dryer than it has to be.<br>  Think about it, why would a nocturnal animal need a basking light?|`|nHp8zzkjaa	you should have both.<br>  heat pad on all the time to keep constant temp and light on during day to get higher temps.<br>  They should be on the same side. this is so the python can go to the other side of tank if it gets too hot.

If you add a heat lamp get a 50 watt night light (red or black) and put it on the same end of the tank but off set them. but depending how big the tank is i would have the light on one end ... the heat pad off set like in the middle and then have a cool side... where the water should be.|`|ynqFrXjtaa	Not real sure about a python.  But for our gecko, we have the warming pad at one end of the tank under the sand with his tunnel to crawl into.  The heating lamp is at the other end on the sunning rocks.  There is some cooler spots to go to.|`|iKoxz7w4aa	With most snakes and nocturnal lizards you can use a UTH (under tank heater) or heat tape only. Attach the UTH to a thermostat and check your temps several times to be sure you are achieving and maintaining the proper range. My balls are much more active with UTH only heating, as are my night-time geckos. You can still have a day/night cycle with lighting near the enclosure or a daylight bulb in/over it without the headache that a heat lamp can cause. If you have daytime active animals (those requiring UV lighting) then a heat lamp is needed for basking, nocturnal animals heat themselves from the warmth left in the ground after the sun goes down so do not need a basking area (it usually just stresses them).|`|sSJ8zfebaa	no need for lamp-heat rise so snake will move over undertank heater when he wants

She is a well experienced dog owner, with years of training experience, and thought it would work out well. It didn't. Her wolf puppy killed her cats after turning 10 months. She took him to a training specialist to help with this. At 16 months,  the pup dug out of her yard to kill the neighbors 3 cats ON the neighbors porch. The neighbor would have shot the dog that night, if he wasn't so fond of my friend. Sadly, when the dog dug through the next time, there was a toddler visiting. The good news is the child is ok. Needless to say the dog was killed that night. This dog was well trained, well socialized, unbelievably devoted to his owner, and had friends who were children. None of that mattered when 30lbs of fresh meat was next door, running and squealing. Don't do it!! It's cruel to the animal, and dangerous for everyone else. Wild animals are meant to be wild. There are thousands of them turned in to rescue each year, because they just cannot live a domesticated life!|`|taLD45Sqaa	I can't comment from experience on the wolf part but I know that the Siberian part is work enough and many people think my dogs are part wolf anyways..... and they're not. Please ask yourself why you want a wolf hybrid in the first place and be honest because you will only be lying to yourself! Siberians themselves are hard to handle and take much dedication and time. They are awesome dogs, very smart and beautiful but they dig, run away when loose, are terrible off leash, stubborn and therefore hard to train, chewers because they get bored easy and you can't wear them out.  They can be aggressive if they are dominated, they need a clear pack leader that provides much guidance and they benefit greatly from training. Hopefully someone can fill you in on the wolf part!|`|U1RcZjqJaa	My friends had a wolf hybrid and he kept getting out of their yard. He ended up getting on the freeway one day :( so I think that if you are going to own one you need to make sure you have a very secure yard.|`|jaGwCbruaa	I've lived in Arizona where having a "wolfdog" is part of the element. They are beautifully physically (hey wolves are awesome looking), but their temperament is meant for the wild.<br>  <br>  But every dog is different. So out of a litter of 10 pups, 8 who might not live in the wild, this person is trying to make his own money.<br>  <br>  Living in the real world ... and working in zoos ... wolves are a totally different animal from domesticated dogs.<br>  <br>  A wolf hybrid is from a not respected breeder of dogs - plain and simple. <br>  <br>  Breeders can be good and most don't have a clue to what they are creating except their own money-making schemes.<br>  <br>  Malamutes and husky's are totally energy. You cross that with a wolf, well you better have lots and lots of land and a lot of patience to really  train the dog to not run off. <br>  <br>  Neighbors complain about chickens, lambs missing? That's where the training comes in.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be harsh.<br>  <br>  But I've had enough of people trapping and making their domesticated dogs breed to make "coydogs." ... for their profit.<br>  <br>  One more answer.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	We've got a siberian husky.

Just think about it... the creation of a creature that is neither domesticated pet, nor wild animal? Belonging in neither world? Not as tough as a wolf, but not able to be happy living with humans like a dog?<br>  <br>  Jeez... just get a DOG! Why the hell do you need a "wolf hybrid"?! It's just STUPID...<br>  <br>  Add: and TRAIN a wolf? WTH? That's like saying, "I'll get a litter box for my pet lion."|`|HuJmTs8xaa	I would advise 100% against that. My sister has had a wolf hybrid and a siberian husky. She gave the wolf away when she was a puppy because she read when they grow up, they are known to attack anything that runs by, and our little brother was a toddler at the time. Her Siberian husky is a horrible dog. We haven't been able to give her away, because no one wants her. She viciously attacked our other dogs numerous times and one was almost paralyzed. She doesn't show much affection and she's very weird. She is basically a real wolf bred over a period of time and she still has the mind of a wolf, and wolves or any other dog with the behaviour or mindset of one should not be pets. If you have your heart set on getting either, I would stronly advice you to only get one if you don't have any other animals and enough yard space and time. The weirdest thing about our siberian is that she loves to stay in her cage in the house for hours and hours just to watch our cats go by and things like that. She's very weird. Good luck.
xmoNQ2rPaa	Re-seal it. If you are not comfortable doing it yourself, call a LPS and see if someone there is willing to do it for you. I had to re-seal my 90 gallon aquarium and the owner of my LPS did it for me for $5.00.

SGwxaTIGaa	It's a bit hard to see but can you see her gravid spot? (a dark square just above her bottom fins) it can be hard to see because of her colouring. That is where the babies are kept, platys are live-bearers (give birth to live young).

You'll find out for sure in a week or 2.  Be prepared you'll start having new fry in the tank every 4 weeks for 6 months with just one mating.  Then in 2 months the fry will start reproducing also.  You'll end up buying tons of more tanks like I've had to do, and you'll be back on here asking how to stop it.  You can't, unless you totall yseparate the males and females before they're old enough to breed.

Maybe it's because I rescued him or because I'm a female. I'm not quite sure the exact reason, but I do know that some cats prefer to be left alone while others will be overly friendly. <br>  <br>  Seems like Sylvester is very attached to you. The other members of your family might not be as receptive to his loving as you are and that might be why he clings to you.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	My kitty follows me around everywhere, too.

You are his "Lady Friend". Cats think that we humans are just a wee bit dim witted. Why else do we throw food away in a garbage bin. They treat us as if we are to simple minded one in the family.

Are you going to continue to foster? If so I would keep the vaccines current.|`|AtiNu3Ovaa	Vaccines are needed on an annual basis. Cost depends on whether she is going to be indoor or outdoor. Indoor cats only need the basic upper resp vaccine, which runs aroun $70. Outdoor cats require the upper resp, as well as feline leukemia. For the combo youre looking around $100. Rabies is recommended for both indoor and outdoor, since you never know what critters may end up in your house. That done in combination with either combo is about an extra $30. These are ballpark prices, all vets may charge higher or lower. <br>  <br>  Kitty would probably like some toys. Other than that, and the unexpected accidents, i think youve got the general idea!|`|9EKecl3Daa	Cats should have shots every year, along with a check up, usually about $80.00 once a year. I would also keep a few hundred dollars set aside in case they get sick. Apart from that they are pretty self sufficient. they will tell you when they want petting and when they don't they'll let you know.

This is what we did before the vet)<br>  Place hot wet washclothes on the wound for about 30 minutes (replace cooled off washclothes with another hot washcloth). The heat of the water draws out infection.  Then cover with a clean cotton bandage.  I know this bandage staying on is close to impossible with a dog but any attempt is good.   <br>  <br>  To start the process, the vet is a good person to talk to. Explain what happened, explain the wound and just ask how much the bill would most likely be. Ask what their payment plan options are (every vet I have been to has a payment plan option). Ask what the other options are to stitching and/or surgery.  <br>  <br>  Your rott is not going to be taken away because some pitt attacked her in the front yard.  <br>  <br>  Next I'm guessing the vet will tell you to call animal control or he/she will call because the Pit Bull doesn't have any records of rabies shots so no one will be sure if your dog has been contaminated.  The pit bull will probably be put into quarantine to see if symptoms of rabies appear.  Your dog may need additional treatments because the history of this dog is unknown.      <br>  <br>  You're facing a very grown up situation here. I don't mean that to sound sarcastic...I'm being serious.  I know this is going to be difficult and uncomfortable.  I'm sorry you have to experience this.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I think the shelter will be more offended when those wounds get infected and your rott loses her legs.  Vet her or give her back, for crying out loud.  She is in PAIN.  Have you ever been seriously bitten?  Puncture wounds hurt like hell!  If they'd known you were just going to leave her with open wounds they would not have let you have her in the first place.  I'm glad that you really seem to love your dog and want to take care of her, but open puncture wounds should not be ignored.  She needs medical attention, both for infection and for pain management.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	You can use alcohol and peroxide to clean and close a wound, but make sure the dog can not lick at the wound spot (since its on its leg), which can cause infection.<br>  <br>  I know you said you don't have money for a vet, but it may be a good idea to.  Dogs have diseases just like humans, and since you don't know if this dog has been vaccinated for them (for rabies, parvovirus, parasites, kennel cough, etc), the bite would have made your dog at risk for getting this!  <br>  <br>  Call local vets and ask how much a visit will cost.  I know some vets set up payment plans now to pay off medical costs for pets during these hard times.  Just call until you find someplace that will work with you.  <br>  <br>  Then, put your foot down with your mother.  SHE needs to take this dog in for tests and vaccinations for not only the safety of your dog, but for the safety of YOU!  Dogs can transmit diseases to humans as well, and for instance rabies, it is lethal once humans begin to show symptoms.  I'm sorry you have to fight with your family on this but this is dangerous for your mother to put others around her at risk.  Shame on her. :(|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Denying your dog proper medical care will result in the dog being taken away.|`|26PPwzrWaa	All dogs are capable of biting. My lab mix is what bit me, not my chow/lab mix or my dane. But guess which two would not be covered by insurance and which one would? <br>  <br>  Clean up the wound. Although at this point, you need to call the vet. <br>  <br>  Giving her away, puts liability for them to come back and sue you/your mom if you knew. <br>  <br>  Just keep them apart, and start learning dog behavior: <a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a>|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I take it you don't like Pit Bulls.  <br>  Your description of a dog fight is... ermm.. unusual.  The Pit was gnashing her teeth??  In a dog fight??<br>  Who started the fight? Your cross breed or the Pit Bull? <br>  <br>  The Pit Bull sounds a friendly dog to be licking your dog's ears and sitting on her.  Dogs don't smack eachother with their tails either.<br>  It seems your dog likes this new dog because she certainly would not allow the Pit to groom her and sit on her if she didn't like her.<br>  <br>  You are projecting your dislike of Pit Bulls onto your dog.  I hope you treat this dog your mother has taken on with kindness.  It's not the dog's fault it's is a breed you don't like.<br>  <br>  If your dog does have open wounds then you are responsible for providing veterinary care for her.  Failing to provide proper vet care is what can have your dog taken from you.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I don't see why you believe someone will take your dog away if you take it to the vet.  You couldn't help it if the dogs got into a fight.<br>  <br>  Pit bulls get a bad rap.. but not knowing the history of the dog your mom has taken in can be "iffy"... Pit bulls are normally just like all other dogs, and can be loyal companions if raised from pups... they are protective.  If a pit bull (or any other dog) is never socialized with other dogs or people, therein lies a problem... it's the human's fault, NOT the dog's.<br>  <br>  Anyway try neosporin on the dog.  It won't burn.  If she will  let you cover the sores up without ripping gauze off, then wrap her leg for a day or two (but keep applying the salve)
KZ7BeVRaaa	Have you been around any other animals during your time away from Fluffy?  Strange scents, particularly of other animals, can put a cat on edge.  Things like aftershave and cologne won't mask the scents, so perhaps you could try to keep a few outfits at your mother's (that are also washed there, to avoid other animal scents) and shower there before approaching Fluffy.  That might help to diminish any scents that are causing her anxiety.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't fret too much, because the problem will likely work itself out once you've moved back in and both you and Fluffy are adjusted to the change.  Good luck!|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	It takes cats time to accept people. They always act harsh towards those whom they dont recognize.

They have done this since they were 5 months old till now 1 1/2 years. Humping, snorting, jumping, teeth showing, but then they end up licking each other's tongues. Also they take turns getting on their back to be submissive. Some dogs even bark when they play. If one dog is controlling the other dog and making him shy away that is not play. My dog does this with my sister's mini pin. Since this is my dog's house, the mini pin ends up spending all the time up on the couch away from my dog and they have to be separated when they eat or they attack each other. The mini pin used to bite my puppy when he was very young and the mini pin was bigger then.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Both dogs are exhibiting dominant body posture in this clip, the JRT more aggressively so, but neither is the innocent victim.

Wow. I've seriously never even thought about it! Let's see:<br>  <br>  Food- About 15-30 Australian Dollars(AUD) a week. It really depends on the cost of meat that week, and how many different kinds we buy and break down ourselves on shopping day. <br>  Toys- AUD$1.50 a month. Tennis Balls are all that Stollie wants, Nipper doesn't do toys. I replace them monthly, because he's feral with them and they don't last any longer. Oh and a one of cost of AUD$2 for one of those extended ball flingers. Because he drools, and it's just gross. <br>  Accessories- We've had the same leads and collars through several dogs, we favour Choke Chains, but collars etc. Aren't too expensive. <br>  Bedding- Umm.... They sleep on hessian dog beds with metal frames. They're cheap, and the idiots like to chew bedding. The hessian gets replaced once every 2 months or so, and that's about AUD$25 per sack.<br>  Vet Bills- I honestly don't know. I don't pay for vet care, my parents do. I would say about AUD$100-AUD$200 a year, what with check ups and booster vaccines, etc. Neither of my dogs are neutered yet, and I haven't looked into prices. <br>  Flea and Worm treatment- Fleas is monthly drops of that Frontline stuff, worming is every three months on worm tablets/ chews. These are another expense I'm not too sure about, couldn't be any more than maybe AUD$30 every three months, I should think.<br>  Registering the dogs is between AUD$10 and AUD$35 a year, for where I live.<br>  <br>  I never took either dogs to puppy classes or obedience classes, I've taught them basic obedience. I will be getting a trainer in, and I can't see that being cheap at all. <br>  I clip their nails, and groom/bathe them myself, which isn't too hard once you know what you're doing. Only one of my dogs actually needs clipping, the bigger dog wears his down on his own. If I think of anything else, I'll add it. But I think that's about it. Honestly, though, the financial cost of a dog pales in comparison compared to the mental and emotional one. Dogs, especially puppies of a larger size(once they get to about 6 months), are frustrating and exhausting. They can wear you down without even panting. They will, however, need and demand you for their entire lives, which makes it all worthwhile. XD

ZD4qrJ8qaa	a lot of times the shelter will vaccinate the dog.  They might even spay the dog.  One thing you need is chew toys.  puppies love to chew.  Shoes and furniture legs, wood molding are common targets.  a bed and if you are going to crate the puppy a crate.  Personally I had a bed for my pup and I used baby gates to lock her in the kitchen at night.  I put a wind up clock in her bed at night (to mimic the beat of her mama's heart/  I went through a lot of beds.  She kept chewing them up.  After a while she settled down but went through many a chew toys before that happened.  Puppies can not hold it all night long.  You need to get up (the amount depends on the age and size of the dog) to take pup out.  its almost like having a new born baby at first.  Lets of work and little sleep but it is worth it|`|fgxajTiBaa	First of all, thanks for adopting!<br>  <br>  To me I don't have a preference between male or female. Males will not spray if you get them neutered, which the shelter has probably already taken care of.<br>  <br>  Usually shelters have the first set of shots given and you have to get the boosters. It can vary between vets but an average price for each vaccine is $20.00. Office visits can cost about $40.00. So you could be looking at around $80-$100.00 for the boosters.|`|AA12148328	The cost of the first shots are usually included in the adoption fee , as is the spaying or neutering . Most shelters wont let you adopt unless you agree to do the operations before the dog is 6 months or so . <br>  The shots if I remember right are just the puppy shots , I think the rabies is for one year . The next rabies is usually for four years .I also think the pups are wormed too .<br>  I do know when I adopted a shelter pup , I singed a agreement to have the spay done , the cost of the spay was included in the adoption fee , at a discount .<br>  I don't know where you live , so just call the shelter , or go there and ask what their guidelines are for adoption  .And what is included in that fee as to shots  and etc.|`|GaL66jbQaa	spraying is mostly a training thing . usually shelter dogs are up to date on shots. puppies need shots ever 3 weeks for the first 6 months I think<br>  <br>  Crate<br>  leash<br>  collar<br>  blanket<br>  food<br>  chew toys<br>  appointment to see the vet<br>  bitter apple spray<br>  first aid kit<br>  a book about training puppies<br>  newspapers or peepads<br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't list dishes because for the first month my dogs are hand fed during training games or fed their food in toys<br>  <br>  download Before Getting your puppy<br>  <a href="http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html</a>|`|AA10356572	if you get the dog neutered he wont spray, <br>  females cost more to spay than a male does to neuter.  most shelters have the pets vaccinated ect first.<br>  generally it is cheaper to adopt than to get one "FREE" and have all the medicat done to it on your own.<br>  here is a great link on how to select a puppy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Selection-and-Purchase-of-a-Dog-or-Pup.80243" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Selection-a...</a>|`|OFpl236faa	The shelter is going to require the dog be fixed. I find boys more goofy and outgoing. If you potty train correctly, boys do not mark in the house and some people teach their boys not to lift their leg at all. Girls can be a little more moody and more serious. If and when you get a second dog, I always find it better to get a dog of the opposite sex. Since you are only getting one dog, male or female doesn't really matter. Just depends on the dog. Most shelters do vaccinate, but it depends on the shelter really. Some will even spay and neuter a dog, but depends on the age and if they do the early spay/neuter. Depends on the shelter also. I always find it best to rescue, so way to go there!<br>  <br>  I find that a crate in very helpful when bringing a puppy home. Helps with potty training, dog can sleep in it at night and gives puppy a place to be when you can't be watching it.<br>  <br>  You'll need leash (or a couple since puppies chew), collar, bed, chew toys (a must for a puppy), bones, toys, food, treats for training, clicker (makes it fun to teach your dog new things).<br>  <br>  Puppy vaccines aren't all that expensive and at that age, puppy probably won't have the whole puppy series of shots. Just talk to a vet about it. Also ask the shelter for a record of anything they have done.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well a female wont spray like a male but if you don't get a female spayed in time they will run off on you. males only spray if they are not neutered in time. also when you adopt from a shelter they make you sign a contract saying you will get the dog spayed or neutered with in a certain amount of time.<br>  <br>  as far as shots go they are up to dated on they shoots. that they are old enough to get at whatever age they are. if its 8 weeks its not gonna have its rabies because they cant get that till 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  if your gonna get a puppy you will need to potty train it so you will need a crate to put him in. that is big enough for him to turn around and lay down in. it will need plenty of bones and toys to chew on so he doesn't chew on your personal belongings. collar, leash,food and water bowls.<br>  <br>   puppies are a lot of responsibility they are just like having a one year old child running around. they get in to anything and everything. they need plenty of exercise. you will need to have lots of free time to spend with him and train him properly.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	You need decent food! i use barf patties (biologically appropriate raw foods) for the wet and advance bikkies for dry. As far as male and female goes it doesnt matter because you need to get the animal desexed! Spraying will not be an issue provided you get it done asap ie 6mth old. Vaccines, these are genarally done at 6, 10 and 12-14 weeks this varries depending on the vet. They then need to be done annually. It depends on the shelter as to what the dog comes with but if all vaccines are all ready done make sure you get a card with treatment history!|`|AA11556697	i have always adopted.... to ge your pup situated you will need food, leash, color w/tags, cage/crate, toys LOTS of them, teething toys called nyla bones...<br>  <br>  ask the shelter your adopting from what they gave to the dog inregards to shots, ask if he has been dewormed and tested for heart worms..<br>  <br>  usually you will get one free vet visit with the adoptions this is usually good for  1 or 2 more shots also make sure you get a persciption for interceptor or heartguard (these will both prevent heartworms in puppys which can be deadly) <br>  <br>  is the puppy spayed/nautered? if not does the adoptions place pay <br>  for this? or will you have to have he/she fixed with your own ?|`|rBTxIbh0aa	well females are the easier sex to train and are actualy more protective then most males....males do tend to lift there leg but if u get a male and get him fixed befor hes old enough to start lifting his leg to pee it actualy makes them realy easy going and almost as easy to train as a female but for a first time owner ur better off going with a girl ur best bet to find out if u need to get shots for ur puppy would be to ask the place when u get her some places give the shot and some dont so u'll need to ask shot prices very on were u live but it normaly cost between 20-30 dollars some times less|`|bwTOwlWBaa	I heard males are calmer.  I've had 3 dogs, 2 boys and one girl. Im sure its not always the case, but in my experience thats how it was too.  <br>  anyways Im sure they do already have their shots. in fact I dont think they usualy sell them without being fixed to. at least the place I went.  You could always ask too.|`|MV1l9yGIaa	Most shelters have already given the necessary vacines to the animals. You will need to get shots for the dog every year and also heart worm meds. Animals are expensive to keep. If your not ready to get to the vet's office every year or so than forget it.|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	The spraying thing is only for cats.<br>  <br>  I think females are better. I have 2 girl dogs. <br>  <br>  If you want to know what shots they have and what they still need, just ask them. Then find a cheap vet clinic close to their house so you can get their other shots later on. <br>  <br>  Get a kennel, and comfy blakets (inside), and cover the top up with a blanket also. It makes them feel safe to have a little cozy cave. Get some chewy toys, a food and water bowl, a lease, a collar, a tag with their name on it and your number (they have machines at PETCO, Petsmart and Walmart. Get a dogh brush and puppy shampoo. And some CARPET cleaner for when you are potty training.|`|kTBE4dYEaa	female dogs who have been desexed (do this at 6 months old) are very loyal and make great pets. some adopted pets have had their vaccines but others haven't so you'll need to ask at the adoption centre. if she's only 2 months you'll have to get her second lot of vaccines when she's a few months older they're a few hundred dollars from memory.<br>  <br>  you'll need some toys like rope ones to play with, maybe a stuffed toy with a squeak thing in it. lots of towels to mop up all the pee she'll be doing everywhere! a radio is great to have turned on the first few nights she sleeps at your house, it settles them down and makes them feel more comfortable so they don't cry, this worked great with my dog. have a look at those dog training websites too before you get your puppy so you know how much work you're getting yourself into! good luck!|`|9YyzSkXWaa	I would say research at www.akc.org or www.dogbreedinfo.com and also read a book / tips by Cesar Milan ( www.cesarmilaninc.com ).  His obedience and dog psychology are first rate and a major help in taking care of your dog's needs.  Good luck!|`|3K2Ahivhaa	Most shelters will only let a dog go to a new home if they are up to date with all their shots.|`|07JZyIeSaa	Ok to answer your first question, it doesn't really matter what sex you get, females make mess too (remember they get their girlies as well) and male dogs are great if you desex them when they are little, they are less rough and not so territorial that way, its always best to desex your pet unless you want to breed them of course.<br>  <br>  Now for the things you need, you will need to get some flea treatment and worm treatment. These 2 things u usually would need to give the dog once a month to stay healthy, also you will need to take it to the vet to get vaccinated. Sometimes the shelter or pet shop will sell you the animal already vaccinated, if so they would have a record of it so they can give it to you so when you see another vet, the vet will know what past treatments it has have.  However you still need to get booster vaccines for them every 6 months or so. They are about $30-$50 dollars everytime you go, so it does add up but its better to do this then have a sick little poochie.<br>  <br>  Also, you will need to microchip your dog at the vet with your details just in case it gets lost, also you need to register it with the local council.<br>  <br>  Handy tips, i always found that the most effective way in toilet training a dog is buying those toilet traning pads from pets shops etc.. basically there is a scent that attracts them and they do their business there, and trust me, it is going to leave a lot of little suprises for you. Also, try and teach your dog to sit, stay early on with little treats, its better for discipline if u teach them early.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|RZesFdBgaa	dogs are not like cats, they do not spray, an unaltered male dog may pee on stuff, but ive had female dogs that marked as well.. make sure the personality of the puppy matches your house hold not the sex or color.. you might want to think about getting an older dog that is done with all the puppy behaviors, like chewing. also an older dog will likely be potty trained and know a few commands like sit and such.. if your getting a young puppy i would recommend a crate or some kind of way to contain the dog when your not home or unable to watch it...puppy classes are a great way to learn about your dog and you'll have a trainer to answer all your questions.  just remember that a cute puppy doesnt always make a wonderful dog.. i would hate to see the dog end up back at the shelter|`|jysSutSvaa	If you're adopting a pet  1- ask if its already spayed or neutered and ask if it already has its shots.  2- if its from a shelter, again ask them those things or if it doesn't have those, then ask about some kind of voucher or something to get their shots and spay/neuter.<br>  <br>  In my experience- male cats spray.  Male dogs simply mark their territory.  The best thing you can do for any animal is to get it spayed or neutered, neutering at a young age helps prevent them having the urge to mark everything up.  <br>  <br>  anyway, as far as shots go, it depends on where you go n stuff, but you're going to want to keep your animal updated every year or so on their shots too.

Cats (and dogs) have little glands on either side of thier anus. When a gland gets infected it can burst open, or rupture, and become much larger as an open wound. A wound like that will not heal on it's own, or even with topical first aid. You can must get antibiotics ASAP to prevent the infection from spreading through the tissues. If the sphincter muscles of the anus become affected than your cat can lose control of it's bowel movement and the infection can become systemic. The best thing for your cat RIGHT NOW, is to make sure she gets veterinary care. If you are not a vet, you have no business performing any type of surgical procedure.|`|uoxpn8JZaa	please please take your cat to the vet... she needs antibiotics and professional treatment. Having the alcohol poured over an open and infected wound must have been excruciatingly painful for her!

Its worth it for your cat, there's no other humane way to treat her wounds, especially with 'at home' remedies that's for sure!

The breeders are really doing an educated guess, as nobody really knows what will happen before the dog turns 2 years of age, and the new owners can get it tested to see if it actually is good enough to breed.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	A good GSD breeder would NEVER breed for white. White coloring in a GSD is an automatic disqualification in any reputable kennel club.

Anyways, I just found a really good site for you, because you are so keen on getting a White German Shepard Dog (even though a mixed breed would give you just as much love as any other dog... grumble... grumble...). So, I am asking you to rescue your White German Shepard Dog. This way, you can still have one, and you will be adopting!!! I really, deeply, seriously hope you choose to adopt. I did (through a rescue group, like this one), and I am very happy with my decision. Seriously: adopt. <br>  <br>  Here's the link: <a href="http://www.echodogs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.echodogs.org/</a>|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	it depends on what the breeder means by pet quality. <br>  <br>  sometimes a dog is pet quality because of dropped ears, a spot on the coat, or a missing tooth. <br>  <br>  sometimes the dog is pet quality because the dogs whole structure is incorrect, its temperament is seriously flawed, etc.<br>  <br>  a pet quality dog SHOULD, always should have the EXACT same health guarentee as the show quality dog. the dogs hips should dtill be guarenteed, everything.<br>  <br>  <br>  the only reason the dog should cost less is because the breeder cannot use the dog for showing, and cannot hold it back for breeding. Everything else Should be the same. If it isn't, refuse to buy from that breeder.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: "Do pet quality dogs, look like the dog breed? Are they bigger smaller? wrong body shape?"<br>  <br>  it could. Or not. <br>  <br>  for example. My chinese crested is pet quality because he is missing a tooth, and being a powderpuff crested, missing teeth is a DQ. <br>  <br>  every thing else about him is exactly the same as his show quality littermates. <br>  <br>  BUT, on the other hand, sometimes poorer quality breeders won't properly research a line, and will have a litter with some throwbacks(undesirable traits that they tried to breed out, that pop up again). <br>  This pup can be seriously messed up. can have poor structure, be too small, be oversized, incorrect tail set, anything....<br>  <br>  <br>  hopefully even a pet dog will "look" like its respective breed....again, if it doesn't, walk away.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly though, you don't have to worry, seeing as how ALL white GSD's are pet quality. <br>  White is an automatic DQ, so they certainly aren't show dogs, and white GSD's can't work worth a darn either, so they aren't working dogs, all you have left is nothing but pet quality dogs.|`|aded53c56a7a761539a670660f5c26d6aa	Why don't you just adopt..... $800-$1200 to purchase a dog while there is a dog that looks like a white German Shepherd Dog about to be euthanized in the shelter.

The AKC does not allow white GSDs to be shown. Generally, a show quality dog is one that closely conforms to the breed standard--whether they are "prettier" is a matter of opinion. A pet quality dog does not have good enough conformation to be shown. This could be for any number of reasons, like a disqualifying color or an unstable temperament.<br>  <br>  Basically, though, if you like German Shepherds buy a real one from a reputable breeder. Don't waste your money on a non-standard variation. (Unless, of course, you find one in a shelter). Don't support breeders who ignore the real breed standard.<br>  <br>  edit: The term "pet quality" can mean a lot of things, depending on the breeder. Just ask why a certain puppy was classified as a pet.<br>  <br>  edit 2: You do realize that the White GSD is not a separate breed, right? They are purebred German Shepherds, just a different color. The health statistic you cite is probably from a white GSD breeder trying to sell their product and must be taken with a grain of salt.  White GSDs are fairly new, so there hasn't been time to evaluate every genetic disease they carry. But there is no reason to expect that they would be any healthier than a regular GSD. It would probably be just the opposite, actually, since white GSDs were bred from a small population of regular GSDs and are almost certainly quite inbred.<br>  <br>  edit 3: I'm not "making this all up." I don't mean that your puppy will literally be inbred, I mean that the white GSD started from a very small gene pool. If you go back a few generations, they all have the same ancestors. This is what causes the many genetic health problems in dogs, and the problem will be compounded in white GSDs. Intentional breeding of white GSDs started in the 1970s, so there haven't been many generations yet--that's why only 57 diseases have been observed so far. <br>  <br>  Also, the American White German Shepherd Association is an organization of breeders trying to promote white GSDs. Any information you get from them is likely to be biased.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Pet stock dogs are registered as non-breeders and if that restriction is violated the puppies from the breeding are not registrable.<br>  <br>  The difference between the two classifications is conformation.  Pet stock dogs have features which do not fit the conformation ideals for the breed.  However, when classifying puppies this is not an exact science, I have a pet stock Bitxh Dane who grew up to be nearly a perfect model for Great Dane conformation and form, the breeder misjudged the puppy, it happens.  I don't breed and have no interest in the conformation ring, so my dogs are always pet stock.  Sometimes they will have visible conformation issues, sometimes as in Seiko's case, they're conformation perfect.  Also, some breeders will register dogs as pets even if the conformation is there if they do not have enough "Qualified" breeders looking for their stock, this helps protect the line from mills and unqualified back yarders.<br>  <br>  The lack of public knowledge about the two levels of registration is something that BYB's take advantage of and is the source of the line, "Oh both parents are registered but we don't register our puppies because we sell them as pets."... call that one, ask to see the papers, in Canada non-breeding registration has a green border, a puppy from that litter is not registrable, and the breeder you're dealing with in that case is not legitimate.<br>  <br>  Non-breeding registered dogs are intended to be fixed, and failing to do so is a compromise of personal integrity and honesty.<br>  <br>  For a pet owner, I see no argument whatsoever for buying breeding stock.  The pet registered dogs are great pedigree dogs, perfect for the home and non-breeding life.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	White GSD'S are unacceptable to the AKC therefore you are not getting show quality, unless your breeder has established its own registry and its own shows.The difference in show and pet quality is basically nothing, only that it may have a minor but acceptable defect and you have paid extra. Yes you can breed them|`|oGVWdnHraa	A pet quality GSD is a dog which conforms closely to the breed standard, a pet quality pup does not.

Im just curious as to why you wouldnt move to a bit if he bolts with you, I have nothing against hackamores and I love using them! :)  I use this type of hackamore, <a href="http://www.horse.com/Fleece-Lined-Hackamore-WBE12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Fleece-Lined-Hackam...</a> I really like them and its mild. I use it for my gelding when I give lessons off him. It keeps the kids from pulling on his mouth since he has a really soft mouth and Id like to keep it like that.

The aspirin will help relieve some of the pain.  My puppy did the same thing.  He will sleep a whole lot and that is normal, just let him sleep it off and try not to handle him too much.

ZuH73QvWaa	Hmmmmm. I would get him re-checked at the vet again. What you had suspected as mites may have been something entirely differnent (food allergies, excessive amount of protein in the diet, fungal infections, dry skin etc.)<br>  <br>  I would have a very good look through his fur once again, mites can often be quite hard to see. If you are a hundred percent sure it could not possibly be mites, then it is most definetly one of the above. However, if you do manage to find those nasty little beasts lurking in your rat's fur, the best way to treat it is by using Revolution: for puppies and kittens. Right now I am using it for my rats and a lot of the scabs are healing up quite nicely in just under 2 weeks! Yes, it is made for dogs and cats but also works very well on rats. I am positive that it will not poison or harm your rat!<br>  <br>  If you do decide to use Revoultion, give your rat 0.03ml of the medicine every 2 weeks (this is what my vet had told me). He also told me only to do 3 doses of 0.03 ml but if you want I would just do it until the mites are completely gone. <br>  <br>  All you need is a syringe. Which you will fill with the required amount needed and then apply to the back of your rat's neck.<br>  <br>  For further imformation please refer to this website (highly reccomened):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ratfanclub.org/skin.html" rel="nofollow">http://ratfanclub.org/skin.html</a><br>  <br>  I hope your rat gets better. Good luck!|`|BWez86Ldaa	I agree with C. Go back to the vet and see what's up. For now, though, you can use some Neosporin on the scabs and see if he quits scratching (I was personally advised by an ER vet that neosporin will work just as well on cuts and scratches as anything they can give you). Good luck!|`|zW5OWgXtaa	You can try giving him a bath, or go to the vet and have them check him out for free. My dog used to ich for some reason too, we took her to the vet and they didn't see anything. Your rat could have fleas?|`|8NEU9A4Zaa	A healthy dose of rat poison should do the trick.|`|YqVtOSWwaa	How sure are you he had mites? Were you directed by a vet at all? If you did see traces of mites, that may have been, but what you described sounds more like an allergy.<br>  <br>  Often in the case of an allergy, the lesions occur from skin irritation, not just him scratching constantly. He may be allergic to anything from his bedding, food or something you spray in the air. It may even have been whatever you used for the mites.<br>  <br>  I suggest you take him to a vet, or at least, give them a call, and describe the situation. If you want to stop the scratching, you need to figure out the source of the itching, and remove it. And a vet will help greatly.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	You might try decapitation.  That will certainly curtail the scratching.

Bnkx4Wozaa	You are correct! Cats and dogs are very different when it comes to trainning. Dogs adhere to their owners command, which they see as the pack leader. Therefore, they are more likely to follow vocal commands. Cats however, do not and they need to be motivated to do it. When you want a dog to do a trick or two, you command him, but when you want a cat to perform, you suggest! :)<br>  <br>  Clicker trainning is one of the most effective method in *trainning* cats. There are other methods than can be considered. Just remember that cats need to be motivated and rewarded in order for them to perform for you!<br>  <br>  Read more about it here:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/clicker-training-your-cat/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/clicker-tra...</a>|`|dsNGz3V4aa	Yes, you definitely can train them to sit, fetch, roll over, do simple tricks. Dr. Sophia Yin has really good tips on training cats to do these things. I'm not sure what her website is, but if you look up animal behavior she is a well known behaviorist and awesome at training. Good luck|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	Take care is absolutely right, it's a question of motivation.<br>  <br>  You're in charge so the dog tries to do as he's told.<br>  You try the same thing with a cat and he'll just stare at you then go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  I only train my cats to not do things (like not clawing my bed). I tell them no and make sure they have alternatives. I have a cat who loves to play fetch, but I didn't train him to do that. He likes to chase his toys and he knows I can throw his toys for him, so he brings them back to me. <br>  When I was a kid we had a young cat and a young dog at the same time.  The cat watched me train the dog to sit on command. This training included a lot of treats. I noticed that when I'd go to get out cat treats that cat would frequently sit down. So I started telling him to sit before giving him treats or opening a door for him. He did it every time. I can't take any credit for training him, he just saw that the dog got something nice for putting his butt on the floor.  This seemed like an acceptable arrangement for the cat, so he did it too. <br>  <br>  With enough patience on the part of the human and the cat, they can be trained to do a lot of things, but you have to approach cat training differently from dog training. You are not the boss with a cat.<br>  I've seen this guy live: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yysiOeVZsw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yysiOeVZ...</a>   There are lots of videos of him and his cats.  They can be trained to do a lot, but it can't be easy.|`|MLC97M1Baa	It is possible yes. Go on Karen Pryer clicker training, and you will see. :)
AA10247494	What breed do you have? I've got an Appy mare with the same problem. Here's how I do it (I don't have any pics) step by step.<br>  <br>  First I wash and comb the mane down and pick the desired length. I usually go for eight to ten inches. <br>  <br>  Second I use a yard stick and pushing it down from the top of her neck to the desired length I flatten the mane down as much as possible against her side and use a good pair of VERY SHARP scissors and then I cut just below the stick in a straight line down the length of her neck.<br>  <br>  Third I go back and ensure the evenness of my cut before I remove the stick.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and brush out the mane and let it dry. The top layers will have more lift than the bottom layers giving the mane a slightly layered look with out using thinning shears.<br>  <br>  If you want to add a more natural look (if it's still too bulky... my mare doesnt have this problem) you can (after the above steps) go back and mash sections of the mane down and working 4-5 inches up from the end take a razor at a slight angle and run it down to the tips of the mane. Work in sections and this shave small amounts of hair from the top which will eliminate bulk and make it look more natural.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Most of the time when people use scissors it turns out awful.  I used thinning shears on my mare when her mane got thin and they worked great!  If you don't have thinning shears, I guess you could use a SHARP pair of scissors like thinning shears and use one blade to cut the hair by running the blade down the length of the hair.  But if you want a natural look, I wouldn't go cutting the hair.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|d1PLrU2zaa	Don't whatever you do cut it with scissors. I t is extremely difficult to make it not look awful when you cut it like this also it will make the mane far to thick. This is coming from personal experience.|`|fQxSClHKaa	i just cut straight across.<br>  but then again i braid for english shows.<br>  here's what it turns out like - <a href="http://s204.photobucket.com/albums/bb142/kaylie107/?action=view&current=100_3577.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s204.photobucket.com/albums/bb142...</a><br>  good luck !|`|9BNHNcDbaa	i pull my horses mane, or use a razor meant for their mane at the tack store, it is specially designed for trimming the mane good luck, and dont cut it with scissors|`|GksOStrsaa	Scissors DON'T work. If your horse's mane is already thin, try blading it.|`|BREi7qw7aa	uh.. i wouldnt do that.. it usually turns out horrible. i suggest pulling your horses mane, it looks alot more natural|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I second the above answer, thinning shears.<br>  <br>  Pulling the mane isn't mean though... horses don't even have nerves in their mane!<br>  <br>  I have a special comb that takes hair out without thinning the mane.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Use thinning shears or something. Don't just cut it with scissors but if you must do it vertically.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Insert your thumb and forefinger into the loop ends of the scissors. When you spread your thumb and forfinger apart the blades of the scissors will open. Lay your opposite hand flat on the top of the horse's mane. Position the blades of the scissors just beneath your bottom finger. Close your thumb and forefinger to close the blades of the scissors (don't cut your hand) and the hair will be cut if you're using sharp scissors.<br>  <br>  A cut mane doesn't look natural, it looks cut but when it's braided for a show you can't tell if it's pulled or cut and your horse doesn't care either way. I've always cut the mane and bridle path for my current horse. He looks like a donkey because the hair is so thick but when he's braided he looks great. Just cut the mane and don't worry about it.|`|sLhwyMw9aa	i have used this method on both my horses, use a pulling comb and back comb the hair to the length you want then use a good pair of scissors and cut the ends off only do a small amount at a time this way you will be only making the mane shorter and not thinning it.<br>  i used this method as one of my horses did not like having his mane pulled and it saved big arguments with me and a 16.2hh horse|`|AA11570905	IF I use scissors I use THINNING shears.  I have a kit like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=SLT771075" rel="nofollow">http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.as...</a><br>  and use the thinning blade to trim the mane.  You just hold the mane down and scrape the blade over the hair in a downwards motion.  It looks very natural when I'm done.  I NEVER pull my horses mane.  It think it is mean and it just grows back all over again.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	you don't cut with scissors if you want it to look right.  I have never seen a scissored mane that didn't look absolutely hideous.
pTmrZicfaa	If you do roach it, just clip his bridle path with clippers and keep going... It's really easy.<br>  <br>  I don't think he would look as good because he doesn't really have a good neck for it, but I saw your other post about how his mane is really thin... <br>  <br>  If you want to thicken his mane up, this would probably be a good way to go as it usually makes manes thicker.<br>  It'll take anywhere from 4-8 months to grow back pretty much normal... Depends on the horse and his diet.<br>  <br>  However, if you are showing western I would not recommend doing it. All the western shows I've seen have horses with manes that you can put in bands.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you do decide to roach it I recommend: Not showing if the judges don't like roached manes, and also looking into exercises to help bulk up your horses neck.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ikBEORfqaa	he doesn't have the neck for it. it also takes forever to grow out. still, you should do what YOU want. cut first with scissors then roach with clippers. you don't want to clip straight across or it'll look terrible. you need to shape it. same size clippers all the way - #10 blade. a friend roaches her horse's mane. she does a mohawk. he's got the neck for it and it suits him, plus she gets a big kick out of it. people often forget to have some fun with their horses.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	I wouldn't do it. <br>  <br>  Roached manes look best on horses with thick, curved necks.  <br>  <br>  Good looking roached mane:<br>  <a href="http://www.willowsedgefarm.com/images/Ole_formal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.willowsedgefarm.com/images/Ol...</a><br>  <br>  Bad looking roached mane:<br>  <a href="http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/pictures/files/3/5/5/8/009_9_533677.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/pic...</a><br>  <br>  I don't think your horse has the neck for it.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	It looks to me like that first horse's mane is much thicker then your horse's. You should also note the conformational differences between your horse and the pictured horse - you may not like your horse with a roached mane at all. <br>  <br>  I've roached my friend's horses mane before. You just shave the entire mane off, and it sticks up as it grows. I've also roached the manes of several Mules. <br>  I used my clippers that I use for everything - it has an adjustable blade, but I can't remember which setting it was on. <br>  <br>  I take lessons from a Quarter Horse judge, and have gone to several clinics held by two other QH Judges. All three of them tell me they DO NOT like roached manes. They prefer shorter manes, exactly how short depends on the horse's conformation, etc. and they like the manes banded. One judge told me a lot of times roached manes make the horses neck look thicker or taller, which makes them look awkward. <br>  <br>  If I owned your horse, I would not roach his mane.<br>  If you show in Western Pleasure, I would just cut it.|`|CwAVLsJdaa	The first picture looked to me like the mane was to the off side of the picture,humm...,as for your horse,I just got a quick glimpse before the advertisement came up but it looked like he had a thin neck,not good for a roached mane.I don't particularly care for the roached mane and other judges go for the short trimmed straight mane but I don't care for that either,lol.I like the long mane on any horse,gated,arabian or quarter horse|`|geeSX6HHaa	A roached mane is mostly for horses with a lot of curvature to their neck.  Such as a saddlebred or a dressage horse has a roached mane.<br>  Most Quarter horse judges are not AT ALL fond of the roached mane.  They like 3 inch long manes that lay flat on the horse's neck.  But if you did want to roach it, what I would do is cut it flat across at about 2 inches long, then carfully clip the rest down being sure that you do not make any big gashes in the hair.<br>  <br>  Very cute horse by the way! :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|bVLwH4jlaa	It is sad that your horse would be judged on the state of his mane. The civilised world bases the quality of horses on their health, performance, and most of all happiness. <br>  <br>  If you are so wrapped up in something as simple as a mane then please shave it bald. <br>  <br>  If you are in an area with a lot of flies and such then please take care of his grooming and fly-repellent routine.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that our horse has a complete and thorough health program long beyond aesthetics.|`|I8Tahe4Jaa	You just asked this half an hour ago. <br>  <br>  People can still see your other post and will answer it if you give them time.
KEYgd73saa	If none of the stores in your area carry them, it'd be worth a try to simply ask the managers at some of the privately owned stores (not Petco/Petsmart) to try to get some in with their next shipment.  They're usually happy to try, especially if you show that you'll be a repeat customer.  If not, consider joining an aquarium society!  They usually have monthly meetings, and you'd surely be able to find somebody willing to trade/sell some of their RCS.  Sioux Falls Area Aquarium Society ( <a href="http://www.siouxfallsareaaquariumsociety.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.siouxfallsareaaquariumsociety...</a> ) would be a good starting place.  Usually, you can find the shrimp for about $2-5 retail, though you could probably get a better deal from a private seller.

The judge will be harsh and sentence her to nine life terms!!|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	She loves you :)  She takes comfort in your stuff, so when she wants a comfy item she choses yours for comfort... its like a security blanket really.  I had a cat once that would pee on my clothes if i left the house for too long, she would take my clothes from a pile mixed with my sisters and pee on them.. her way of saying im mad at you!|`|GSkA8wh9aa	Very normal for a cat that is treated well,healthy, loved and LOVES you! I have several like this and it's too cute!|`|yDOTQcZIaa	that's very cute.  she loves you too much. she wants to keep everything that smells like you.<br>  I had a cat, that liked one of her toys too much. she would pick it by her mouth and put it aside in a cornor.<br>  I don't know it is normal or not. but it is very nice and cute.<br>  good for you.|`|HryNywibaa	ya. she probably just is having fun. she probably like biting them and running around with them. it's absolutely normal because my dog always steels my stuff to. And it's ok if she lay's on ur printer she probably finds it comfortable over there. so dont worry about it at all.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	She just loves the clothes because the clothes smell like YOU!!<br>  <br>  My cat use to steal our tea towel, boxer shorts, bread and run around the house with them. It was like she was bringing them to us.<br>  She finally grew out of it.|`|kXdXJKEMaa	yea it is since shes an inside cat and she cant go outside (if she was outside she would hunt things and show them to you) she will get the next best thing to show u what she has caught clothes!|`|oYB9tJrLaa	I would have to say this is normal...<br>  <br>  I have 4 cats and they all have to get into something of mine, the youngest one will grab my slipper and walk around the apartment with it.  I don't know why she does it but it is funny to watch.<br>  <br>  It is just a part of you and when they have it, it makes them comfortable.|`|VVSGFDJkaa	No, I don't think so. Maybe she wants to make a bed from them. My cats never steal my stuff, they just pee on it.<br>  <br>  Your cat must love you!|`|7a72aa876dc8936d9e84970589ec105faa	My cat does on occasion and so does my dog, so I don't think it is unusual|`|ZvOXs61caa	LMAO. SHES JUSTT LOOKING FOR A COMFY PLACEEEEEE!
mOayTJDmaa	If you can see that at a week, you have good eyes.  Separate them and see what they become.  If they are all males, then you know how to tell them apart early.<br>  <br>  Thanks, I'll have to look at my babies closer. (it's not really a fin though)|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Those are the males. You can also tell the females by the gravid spot. That's the dark spot near the tail on the bottom of the belly.<br>  <br>  The males should grow faster if they are seperated from the females. Don't know why it happens, but it does.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	You know why she is crying? because she knows you will give her food. Just ignore her cries.<br>  <br>  As long as she is a healthy weight, you can leave food in the bowl at all times (I would always keep my cat's bowl full, and he was a good weight). The first day or two she may scarf down a bunch, but after that she should only go to the food dish occasionally. Note, you can't do this with an obese cat.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she is rapidly gaining or losing weight, regardless of what you do with food, or she is eating a lot more and not gaining weight, I would bring her into the vet and get her checked out- a blood and urine test to make sure that there is no problems.|`|djLDZXoZaa	i feed my cats half a cup of dry food a day each.  i recently put them on a diet though.  every other day i give them a fourth of cup in the morning and split a can of wet food between the two of them at night. <br>  <br>  if your kitty is eating so much, maybe she is sick?  call your vet please!|`|LrYcvGgiaa	I measure out my cats daily ration of food and put that in his bowl in the morning... he just eats it through the day, and no matter how much he bothers me for food I don't give him any extra.  If I fed him everytime he cried, he'd weigh a ton. <br>  <br>  Is she gaining or losing weight?  If she's gaining stop feeding her so much... if she's losing you might want to take her to the vet and make sure there isn't a health issue.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Well, usually I fill my cats food in the morning and it will last until about 6 or 7, when I refill it again for the night. They practically free feed, whenever the foods gone, I refill it. They are both picky eaters so they are not overweight. lol. :)|`|fIsjIMZHaa	My cats have unlimited dry ( I leave out about a half a cup each a day) they usually don't even finish that then they get wet food every night.  If They eat so little because they are on a very high protein food, fills them up faster.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Twice a day is ideal.|`|lcriDvMKaa	Hey,It really depends on how much your cat weighs.My cat is an indoor cat and he's turning one in march.He's 6kg.I feed him twice a day morning and night and fill the bowl to the top.Alternatively you can leave  a full bowl for your cat to go back to any time in the day.If your worried about feeding her too much choose the indoor cat biscuits it has a lower fat content as indoor cats don't exercise as much.I use whiskas.<br>  <br>  Giving her a few biscuits when she miaows is fine too,i usually give him about 10.<br>  <br>  Good luck im sure shes just being greedy|`|5mPUumWvaa	An auto feeder isnt a bad thing but honestly get her a special  plate (or bowl) and a designated spot for her and give her enough food for the day.  We do this with our cats and they get a few scoops a day.  If you work during the day fill up the bowl with enough food to last her and shell be fine.  That way she can eat when she pleases and she wont wine.  Cats will not over feed themselves, my one cat is plump because of lack of exercise, and the other one who is active is at an ideal weight.  The only food we keep in moderation is their wet food, which they get a small portion every morning (the little stinkers can trick my mom into giving them more after my sister had them already) Just make sure she has clean water and fresh food and shell be a happy kitty!|`|NNxLypgaaa	I put food on her plate whenever it is empty. For dry food, it is usually 1/3 cup a day; for wet food, she eats about 2 small cans a day.<br>  <br>  Maybe instead of feeding her every time she cries, you can play with her instead. Maybe she just wants your attention. At the very least it will distract her.|`|LHSrsHIQaa	Well, maybe she isn't hungry, but it DOES seem like she is genuinely hungry! Maybe she is getting tired of her food, maybe she is pregnant? Many cats I have known get hungrier when they are pregnant. I'd go talk to your vet about it, because they usually know what to do when this happens. Hope this helps. If your cat turns out to be pregnant, congrats! Good on ya :D|`|TK1QQSeFaa	half a can of wet food twice a day but only for 20 minutes each time. <br>  <br>  if your cat is whiney you can leave about half a cup of dry food throughout the day but don't overfeed them!|`|6sJhoXAAaa	My cat eats dry food, so we keep the dish full and she eats when she wants.|`|pDWrOl8oaa	My cats free feed. Maybe you can give her treats between meals.|`|NY4ahjfaaa	I just keep my dish filled all the time. My cat is very petite and eats at will.|`|ddAftoU7aa	I have 2 indoor cats and I keep their bowl full for them. Neither one of them are overweight at all and since they know their food is always there they don't cry. I had a previous cat who I did the same thing with and she was never overweight. I personally think you should keep food out for them ( dry food of course) and let them choose how much they want to eat. If you do notice her gaining weight they do have weight control cat food. I feed them the Purina one dry cat food and they both seem to be happy with it. Just had them checked 3 months ago and they are happy and healthy.
e9gXZsKxaa	He's still getting used to his surroundings, it can take up to a week. Healthy bettas can go without food for weeks, so he's not starving, don't worry. In time he will come around and eat, eventually. Bettas have tiny stomachs, look at it's eye, that's the size of his stomach, so feed accordingly. They only need like 3 pellets a day. Fast one day out of the week, this is good for their digestive system. Give them blanched peas twice a month, peas will help aid in digesting the foods consumed. Variety is important for bettas to thrive, once or twice a week, as for treats, they love bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, baby crickets, fruit flies, and baby guppies.|`|uCKx3Kylaa	usually the betas dont like flakes honestly. try buying granuels or pellets. that is generally what they are fed at the petstore. you could also try feeding freeze dried blood worms. but only as a last resort for that is all they will eat usually once you give it them (it spoils them)|`|dD08pRIwaa	Don't worry this is normal. My betta didn't start eating untill four days after I brought him home. They need betta food not flakes because they are carnivourus and need more protien. That's probably why he didn't like the flakes.They also need more air than others so he will float at the top with his mouth at the surface.|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	you got the wrong food.<br>  you should buy betta food that says BETTA FOOD right on the bottle.<br>  dried red grubs worms is the stuff they like..|`|P06xsw2taa	Go to the store where you got him and ask them what they where feeding him.  Also he should be in a tank 3 gallons or more with tank mates.  he might just be depressed about not being around other fish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	All of my Betta's did this their first week with me, but now they gulp down food like there's no tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Just be sure that their tank is heated. They are tropical fish and their temperature should be maintained between 77F-82F. Colder temperatures could cause refusal of food.|`|AKfZDADmaa	feed him twice a week
8hkr6ZyUaa	no matter what people tell you at the stores<br>  or here<br>  <br>  ammonia will be a problem if you have a filter and it's not cycled<br>  <br>  how do they breathe?<br>  i was quite fascinated with this when my dad got me a betta<br>  i stared at it, wondering why there was 50+ bubbles everywhere...and if he was gonna die<br>  <br>  they have a labyrinth lung<br>  so they stick their mouth out the water<br>  take real oxygen in<br>  and create a bubble<br>  sometimes bubbles come out the gills while they eat <br>  or out the mouth otherwise<br>  <br>  My betta used to go up every 1-2 minutes (especially when the filter was off while I was medicating him) <br>  at night, when he'd rest, he'd get up and go every 5-10 minutes<br>  they can store oxygen longer if they aren't moving around<br>  <br>  eventually, (if your filter has an air pump) he will come to lessen his need to go up for air because he will be able to breathe underwater like other fish<br>  my betta uses his gills more often to get oxygen underwater<br>  and he spends most of his time exploring his tank<br>  <br>  they really do love the space. They love caves and silk trees and bloodworms <br>  <br>  umm as for the uncycled tank, fin rot is a betta's worst enemy<br>  i suggest you add in some salt, stress coat to a 30% water change every day<br>  You know why? Unless you test the water every day you really won't know when an ammonia spike will happen<br>  and Mr. Betta can withstand so much pain he won't let you know by acting spastic<br>  it's better to AVOID fin rot and ammonia....then have to resort to medication/turning the filter off<br>  don't do 100% water changes, stresses em out|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	um i have to say he's fine there is no amount Bettas go up for air so if you are still worried put in a aerator and that is all you can do but cycle it that will help|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Bettas use both their gills and "sip" air at the top of the tank.  Bettas have a special organ, referred to as a labyrinth, that allows them to do this.  So, this is normal for betta fish to sip air at the top of the tank, and I wouldn't be worried about it. ^.^<br>  <br>  If you want, you can have an aerator to increase the oxygen levels of the water in the tank.|`|asXq2cFDaa	They have a labyrinth organ. They use this to breathe from the air, unlike most fish they need to breathe air, no matter how much oxygen is in the tank. It is perfectly normal, mine go up at least once every few minutes, normally more.
0YzP6iOTaa	I felt them moving when she was about a week away from birth. It was too cool, I would lightly lay my head on her tummy and they would kick my face LOL|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	usually around 7 or 8 weeks, soon before they are born.  Just place your hand on her belly and you should feel them wiggle :)|`|KZ7BeVRaaa	Based on experience, I'd say about 2/3 of the way.  <br>  <br>  According to the webpage linked below, fetal movement is easily felt by the 7th week of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Cats-1606/cat-pregnant-1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/q/Cats-1606/cat...</a>|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I could feel her kittens about a week and a half before she had them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  I hope they all are born healthy and well =]|`|gyWCBQm5aa	i didn't even feel my cats kittens moving when she had hers so i would say they are due any day now
10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	Yes. Fleas are intermediate carriers of Tapeworms. It will take about 7-10 days for the worm to attach and start adding proglotteds (the little white 'specks' you will find in the poop). If you pet has fleas you really need to get some frontline and apply it as often as your vet recommends. The you need to clean your house and yard. There are many dusts and sprays that you can buy, however I would only by what your vet recommends. Do not waist your money at Wal Mart/Kmart/Target etc because these medicines are not strong enough to fix the problem. also flea bombs only cover part of the house. You need to make sure you clean furniture and under the furniture. If one flea is left behind then they will come back.
AA11887983	They need to have vitamin c supplements, such as the type added to the water, with the water changed DAILY.  The person who recommended putting it on the food is incorrect.  That is not the recommended way to supplement.  Most pigs will still drink the water.  <br>  <br>  Feed timothy hay, guinea pig pellets, broccoli, green peppers, spinach, kale, cabbage (raw),  parsley, oranges, kiwi.  <br>  <br>  Avoid too many fruits, cereals and sugars.|`|NeymQe9raa	Nothing from the onion family,potatoes,grapes/raisins,nuts, cabbage is supposed to be in their diet. Just imagine what cabbage does to you..it makes you gassy right? Well imagine that in their little stomachs. The vitamin C drops you put in the water are actually not good for GP's because the smell makes them not wanna drink their water and then they get dehydrated...instead get children's vitamin C tablets(only 100% though) and crush it up and put it in their food(I'd say about half of one a day). FEED your pigs cut up Green pepper...they will go bananas,parsley too..cilantro and they love love love celery leaves. GP's usually will not eat anything thats bad for them.|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	Here is what they can eat-<br>  <br>  Carrots <br>  Celery(cut in small pieces though like you are doing)<br>  Lettuce<br>  Cucumber<br>  Broccoli<br>  Cabbage<br>  Apples(not too much)<br>  Oranges<br>  Bananas<br>  Spinach<br>  Grass<br>  Strawberry's<br>  <br>  They can't eat-<br>  <br>  Almonds<br>  dairy products<br>  Wheat (like bread)<br>  Meat<br>  Potato(starch will kill them)|`|AA10972366	THEY LOOOOOVE TIMOTHY HAY!!! ((GET IT FROM THE PET STORE))
ak9DrBSwaa	Hamsters naturally HORDE their food. There name is actually dervived from this behavior. Limiting their access to food would be irresponsible and cruel, since they need to practice their normal behavior.<br>  <br>  Tumors are not uncommon in older rodents. A life with lots of exercise, appropriate size cage and good quality food is the best thing you can do to keep your pets healthy, but is not a guarantee.

ANeF59yMaa	Yes, the rabbit's teeth grow every day. <br>  <br>  But u dont hav to go to the vet every month to hav it filed.<br>  <br>  U hav to provide ur rabbit with HAY. <br>  <br>  Hay is very very very important.  not only it files down th teeth, it is also a gd source of fibre fr th rabbit. and hay is th main meal fr rabbits whereas pellets are like McDonals fr rabbits. <br>  <br>  You do hav to go to th vet once/twice a year, if u can afford, to hav it checked. sometimes, their molars grow too fast n it may need to be filed if u hav been too late, not giving it hay..|`|oGVWdnHraa	Yep they do continuosly grow, but if you have a constant supply of hay and wood chews the teeth should stay down, but there are some cases where this isnt enough for a bunny and they do need to go to the vet for treatment .....just keep an eye on your buns teeth, check them every month or so to make sure they are still good :)|`|AA10972366	Just keep chew sticks and chew toys in the cage for the rabbit to chew on. You can get them at PETCO|`|FfBll2n8aa	Yes, the teeth grow continuously- but only become a problem when they are not aligned properly - ie your bunny has crooked teeth, or his jaw doesn't close straight against the other.<br>  Rabbits need teeth that keep growing because of the food they eat - bark, hay, dried grasses, sticks etc, in the wild. Their teeth would wear out if they stopped growing!! You may not know that other animals such as horses and cows also have teeth that continue to grow.<br>  Anyway, if you are feeding your rabbit correctly, with lots of hay to chew on (and chew toys and even apple tree sticks/branches), your rabbit will wear it's own teeth down without any help. The way they come together when the rabbit closes it's mouth or grinds it's teeth actually wears the teeth down to the correct length automatically.<br>  If your rabbit's teeth are not straight, however, then they can grow very long, and cause your rabbit a lot of pain in the mouth, and stop it from eating. If you take your rabbit to the vet for a check up occasionally, this can be checked. If they aren't aligned properly, they are either filed, or sometimes even clipped off with pliers. It looks brutal, but the nerves in a rabbit's tooth are different to ours, and they don't feel the pain that we would.<br>  I take my rabbits for a check up yearly (unless they show signs of illness and need more regular checkups). This is a good way to make sure the teeth are growing in the right way.<br>  Chances are there won't be a problem - although the dwarf breeds seem to have a problem with teeth more often than others, in my experience.|`|EgRt4LMfaa	our had hers clipped off in the back. she was put to sleep for 10 min. you cant see the back (it takes a tool) -if they drool or their chin is wet take them in asap! <br>  good luck|`|C93lTJozaa	put some wood for him to chew on , This will help.They will keep growing if he dont wear them off on his on,  You can cut them off It hurt me to do this But it helps the rabbit|`|v1tePj44aa	Notice the adorable nose wiggle that gives bunnies their character? That's because they're constantly gnawing down on their teeth. You do need to take them to a vet occasionally to get the teeth filed though.
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	You use both. Without the heat lamp and a temperature gradient through the cage, your beardy won't be able to thermoregulate and digest food. Without the UVB, it'll be unable to metabolize vitamin D3.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should also be getting a book on the care and maintenance of bearded dragons?|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You have to use both. They need the heat lamp for basking and warmth and the UVB for digestion. Why don't you go to some different sites and do some research. Try beardeddragon.org which is a really good site with loads and loads of information.|`|zzzd9tC4aa	use BOTH. The heat lamp helps your dragon digest his food and I think it gives them some minerals. However the UV-B gives the dragon Vitamin D3 which they would usually get from the Sun in the wild. You can buy a UV-B that runs the whole of the cage, or you can buy these special mercury bulbs which emit UV-B as well as heat.<br>  <br>  If you use a UV-B that runs the length of tank, make sure your dragon can get within 6-12 inches of it, so that the UV can have some effect.|`|jDPULfjKaa	You need both!! A heat lamp to create a hot side, and to warm the reptile so they can digest.

We Have put the lamp at the end of the tank and they love it.haven't tried the other.|`|tgROmqffaa	Your gonna need both of them.  I would also reccomend a UVA light.  The UVA and UVB lights imitate the natural vitamins given off by the sun.  By using both of them it will help your bearded dragon stay the healtiest and have the best looking skin.  You'll also need a heat lamp.  The heat lamp provides heat so that digestion and absorbtion of energy can take place.|`|O4hLFvXkaa	Both or your lizard wont get the nutrition he needs. Point the heat lamp at the side of the cage so the heat will go through the glass.
rDl9XR76aa	Actually, the cold will not kill them. Goldfish are coldwater fish, and actually prefer it cooler than tropical fish. The light being on 24/7 though will cause them stress and will kill them. Not to count it is making algae grow. Fish are the same as any other animal in the world. They prefer the day and night cycles each 24 hour period.. So if your not good about waking up at the same time or remembering to turn the light on, you can get a timer from any petstore or even online. Set it and it will turn your light off and on for you at the same time each day... which will be good for your fishies. :-)|`|nHp8zzkjaa	They will be fine if it gets to cold they will go into hibernation.

They would even be OK if the water froze a thin skin of ice.(Any more would damage the tank). The algae is caused by too much light and probably too much food. Goldfish's digestive systems slow way down in water temperatures below 50F. Start doing small water changes and if the water temperature is below 50 don't feed them at all.<br>  Basically you have the ideal fish for a chilly room. Just remember that their appetites go down with the temperatures.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Goldfish enjoy colder temperatures, and unless you like Eskimo conditions in your home, room temperature should be fine and you can turn off the lamp.  <br>  <br>  If you're worried, you can buy a thermometer and keep track of the temperature in the tank.  Depending on the type of goldfish, here are a good range of water temperature:<br>  <br>  Fancy goldfish: 60 F - 75 F<br>  "Long" or "Feeder" goldfish: 55 F - 75 F<br>  (some may be able to tolerate colder temperatures, but I think these are safer ranges, especially if they're kept indoors)<br>  <br>  In terms of the light, your goldfish with be fine without it (as long as you don't have live plants, which need daily light).  I hope this helps!|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	ideal goldfish water temps can be anywhere from the upper 50's to the mid to upper 60's.<br>  <br>  i doubt your room is any colder than that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you can safely turn your light off, it wasn't doing a whole lot to keep your tank warm to begin with.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	You have nothing to worry about, goldfish are coldwater fish, unless your house under 50 degrees (which I doubt), you have nothing to worry about.

asEeCmzraa	Oh, wow... What a terrible, terrible experience for you and your dog. <br>  <br>  However, hard as it may be, don't dwell on it. The dog is most likely already over it. Dogs aren't the same as humans- They don't have the ability to dwell on past experiences, especially one off things such as this. Thi was a horrible accident, sure, but for the sake of you and your dog, you need to move on. Just remember that nothing happened, and that it will not happen again. In the future, when in an elevator, shorten the dogs leash. Make sure he is sitting directly by your side. Stay calm, don't tense the leash, don't constantly reassure the dog, because it will stress him intently. The bottom line is, don't make a big deal of the elevator. If he hesitates, wait until both he and you are completely calm before getting on the elevator.<br>  <br>  I haven't had such an experience, but my dog has suffered after an incident involving a dog attack- Because I can't get over it. I cannot walk him outside of my property due to my anxiety and stress over the attack- And worrying that it will happen again. Don't let your dog suffer due to your anxiety.|`|OxoumjYJaa	OMG! I would have screamed my lungs out with fear! D:> It is the most horrifying experience ever! I was afraid the dog got killed when i was reading it....I am SOO HAPPY that your dog is ok!! Just be Glad your did not get killed since that could have broken his neak and killed him! <br>  Congratulations on having your dog healthy! :)|`|aded53c56a7a761539a670660f5c26d6aa	You can be thankful that everyone is safe and healthy. You now have a life changing experience under your belt that will prevent this from happening in the future. Keep these things in mind and with time you will get past it.<br>  <br>  And, your dog will be just fine, too!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Woah,that is awful!! I'm glad he's OK.Just make sure that he is completely in ( or out) of the elevator whenever he is with you so the leash doesn't get caught again.|`|f51e153f58b38b1f8b2b26277a23a4bcaa	Wow that is so scary! Thank goodness he is okay!  You can get over it by telling yourself, nothing happened, he is okay!  I don't mean "nothing" happened, but I mean that nothing happened to your dog, the leash broke which was saved the dog from being strangled. Sometimes our fear is greater because of our thinking, such as thinking of what "could" have happened. But calm yourself down by dwelling on what did happen, that your dog ended up safe and then the next time you will be very cautious in elevators with your dog.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	hey accidents happen, just think of how lucky you was|`|EeJMITyCaa	I'm just happy that your dog is safe. I hope your dogs doesn't develop a fear of elevators at this experience.
xHxKDQ80aa	Have you tried cutting out meat protein entirely? Have you tried Natural Balance Vegeterian? <br>  <br>  If you are not willing to try that, I would go for a Duck formula like Rice and Duck Simple Solutions Wellness or maybe a venison formula. Lamb tends to be a protein that takes longer to digest and even then some dogs have problems with it.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I think with the quality of Kirkland brand food you are going to be feeding your dog more and a lot of empty calories, which could make your dog fat.<br>  <br>  I know with money tight and the economy being as terrible as it is, it may in the long run cost you less to use a slightly more expensive food because your dogs allergies could get so severe it could go into anaphylactic shock. <br>  <br>  I am a student working for minimum wage and I know what you are going through because my dog doesn't have allergies, but has bad gas on chicken or turkey diets. Although, working in a pet food store does help my situation a little better, the mark up on the foods I buy are not that much.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your choices :)|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I can really relate to what you're going through. My little dog has the same itching problem as yours. I have tried all different brands like you and still have had no luck. But the lamb formula does seem to help some but not completely. The oatmeal baths do seem to give some relief however. Good luck.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	My dogs eat both chicken and lamb( and beef, fish, pork and kanagroo).  Yesterday they had half a raw chook each with some lamb heart!! The day before was a pork hock and tonight is roo chunks with beef kidney.  I too have an 'itchy' dog and any commercial foods at all send her over the top.  Even if she has small amounts of leftovers or a training treat she can end up with bright red lips and underarms!!  Preservatives seem to do it too.... <br>  <br>  All RAW is not created equal - how long did you try it for and what did you feed?    Some dogs can't tolerate any enhanced meats or preservatives, others will react to vegetables and grains etc (which are unneccessary anyway), most pre-packaged raw contains unnecessary and unsuitable ingredients and are ridiculously expensive. <br>  Forget the pre-made stuff - buy from the butcher instead. <br>  <br>  ** I just did some quick calculations from the site you posted ie lbs to kgs, US$ to Australian etc and I spend less than half that amount to feed my dogs and cats.  I know that many people I chat with on rawfeeding groups etc pay no more that US$1 per pound to feed their dogs so again, less than half the cost.<br>  *** I also found it interesting that the site disputed 'certain beliefs' about feeding vegetables and supplements but provided no evidence other than 'it is good for them'.  hmmm<br>  <br>  A lot of supplements can cause problems of oversupply or be made with inappropriate things too - eg cod liver oil, added soy or flax seed, or kelp causing iodine problems.  The only thing you may need to use is omega 3 fatty acids IF you can't access pasture raised meats.  Either use fish body oil or some canned mackeral or sardines in natural oil once a week or so.<br>  <br>  Ground raw will not provide the teeth cleaning benefits of whole or 'big' raw feeding and often contains far too much bone.<br>  <br>  If you feed a diet based around real meat, edible bones and organs your dog's skin and smell WILL improve.  Processed crap-in-a-bag (whether raw or cooked) is NOT the answer for a dog with these skin issues - the poor thing will be miserable!!<br>  <br>  Please feel free to contact me if you would like any information or support.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Try California Natural or EVO.<br>  One is a low allergy blend and one is no grain blend.<br>  They are good dog foods.|`|26PPwzrWaa	How long did you give raw or any other foods? <br>  <br>  I would go back to raw because you can feed him either meat base and control what he does get. <br>  <br>  Have you checked him for fleas, mange, etc. <br>  <br>  What did you feed on raw? <br>  <br>  Out of the foods you mentioned, all have grains except orijen. Have you tried Taste of the Wild, Evo, Before grain, Solid gold barking at the moon. Other grain free foods? <br>  <br>  Given each a min of 4 weeks and preferably 12 weeks. <br>  <br>  Raw took a good two to three weeks before things STARTED to turn around, and everything got worse before. Espcecially their fur, ears, and breath. Not to mention loose stool. <br>  <br>  For raw, did you remove the skin and fat from the meat and were you feeding any bone/bone meal? If not, loose stool will definitely result. <br>  <br>  Go back to raw if you are willing and keep plain mashed pumpkin on hand for loose stools. And dogs are perfectly capable of starving for a few days so whatever you choose, your dog can hold out. If he starves to the point of more than 5lbs weight loss, get to a vet and have bloodwork, etc done.  <br>  <br>  I also suggest not going with any grain food. Stay Atleast grain free. TOTW is grain free, and decently priced. Only problem may be the availability. If TOTW is a no go, look into premade raw: natures variety, urban carnivore, to see how he digest it. Give it 12 weeks please to see how the itching goes. <br>  <br>  If you want to verify what I am saying, take a visit to this forum: <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a><br>  <br>  Please take into consideration what I have stated. <br>  And as for the type to go for, you can go for lamb, but it is not meant to be a long term meat base. For allergies, you may want to try a different meat base for a few months. If no luck, go with the chicken.<br>  <br>  Add: Have you tried going with raw meaty bones and organs, not premade? Where you can control what your dog eats. <br>  <br>  With the food you mentioned, the flaxseed could've definitly triggered it. And the vitamin K worries me, they dont specify if its menadione or natural. They should be using fish oil, not flaxseed for the omegas though. Flaxseed can trigger allergies. <br>  68 a month...*gasp* eeek!!! I dont know what I would do with that kind of bill. I would be living on the streets for three dogs at 68 each. <br>  <br>  What kind of orijen did you feed? And this question has nothing to do with which kind, but how much of it did you feed as well? And what weight do you estimate your dogs ideal weight to be?<br>  <br>  Have you also tried a different base other than chicken grain free like wellness core ocean variety or orijens fresh fish? It could be the Cooked Amino acids from the meat base he's been getting.|`|EQydFhzmaa	My dog likes Pedigree lamb and rice dog food. I don't know if it will help with the itching, but he likes that flavor. Perhaps, your dog may have allergies, maybe even to wheat or something (that's in the food) - just a suggestion. I also heard that a dog can develop allergies if you feed them "people" food, although I seriously doubt this because you are so careful with his diet already, and don't want to compromise his health or anything. It may also help if you bathe your pup with oatmeal dog shampoo - it is soothing for the skin. First and foremost, you should always follow the directions your vet gives you, but since you seem to be at your wits end, you should consider trying something different. Oh, one last thing, we mixed together both dry and wet food for our dog for a little while, because he didn't care for all dry at first. <br>  <br>  I believe this is the oatmeal shampoo my grandmother used for her dogs: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3635635" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> I hope it helps. Best wishes!<br>  <br>  I just read something you said, and Pedigree is a really inexpensive, good quality dog food - plus it helps get dogs adopted.|`|IPlvWyDFaa	We have 4 shepherds and cook our own food for them (lots of chicken, vegetables, etc.) and we also give them Blue Buffalo dry food. You might try that brand as our dogs love that food. I would very much suggest that you go to one of the natural food stores and get some pure fish oil. Give your dog about a teaspoon of fish oil daily on his food  and I think you will find the itching and dry skin clear right up - and - his coat will be beautiful.<br>  <br>  As to the chicken or lamb - they are both good for your dog, ours however, don't like lamb too much - but LOVE chicken.|`|cZm1prgXaa	I think you should try California Natural.  They have all kinds of proteins and no corn.  It's the low allergen food made by NaturaPet.  If he has an allergy, it might be chicken because it is the major protein source in most foods and it is a very common allergy.  Corn is also a major allergen that is present in most grocery store foods and Science Diet.  I wouldn't use Kirkland, it's low quality.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	if the dog food you are currently feeding has corn, wheat, wheat gluten in it, one of these ingredients may be the reason your dog is itchy.<br>  <br>  check the bag.  if kirkland has any of these ingredients, i would think twice about giving it to the dog.<br>  <br>  i do no think it matters about the flavor either way.<br>  <br>  have you tried low dose benedryl on the dog ?  maybe ask your vet about it.|`|kqreMM73aa	I have 2 chihuahuas myself both on Science Diet and they love it.

She was 12 at the time and we were having health issues.  We switched her food and she lived another 3 years with no problems.  I don't know if it was a coincidence or if it really helped.  The only kind of food my dog will eat is Ol' Roy, Kibble chunks and chews.  It has different flavored pieces.  And yes, I know it the cheaper brand at Walmart, but I have to feed him.  I tried everything.  Good Luck on your search for the food that's right for your dog.
IDeVMB8Kaa	Keep her away from other cats and indoors unless you want a litter of kittens.  Female cats in heat are sneaky and diligent watch closely when  you open doors.  The cat knows how to take care of her heat cycle.   Some females like mine find an occasional tummy rub comforting.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	If you want kittens, let her out.  If you don't, be very careful about not letting her sneak out when you open doors and windows.<br>  When it's over, get her fixed (assuming you don't want her to have kittens).  If she's tearing everything up, you might have to keep her in the bathroom (or another room where there isn't too much to damage).|`|NNxLypgaaa	Actually, you can spay her while she is in heat. The vet may charge you a bit more for it though. Fortunately, heat cycles do not last too long (a few days), and I would set up an appointment for her to get spayed next week to prevent this in the future. Plus a spayed cat has fewer health risks!|`|ky3pQS4jaa	Well there are more then one thing you could do. If she/he is not fixed you could fix her/him. Or you could give her some distraction like giving her a toy or a tasty treat.  If she is allowed outside there is another idea.

You need to keep her inside and get her spayed as soon as possible.  By not spaying, you are putting her at risk for pyometra (infection of the uterus) which will cost a lot more then just simple spaying and could also result in death if not taken care of in time.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Yes, there is something you're supposed to do. Have her spayed.<br>  <br>  Fixing your female has a lot of health benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra.

YnCUyvK7aa	My turtle's tank just started getting this stuff a few days ago.  But I've dealt with it in the past too.<br>  <br>  First,scrape off what you can.  You can use a soft sponge made for an aquarium to wipe it off the tubes and the leaves of the plants.  Use your gravel vacuum to get all of what you've scraped off out of the tank. Any that you leave behind can start new cyanobacteria growing.  Do this again every time it starts reappearing.  <br>  <br>  A reason you might be having so much trouble is lack of water movement.  It sounds as if you're only using an undergravel filter in the tank.  Cyanobacteria doesn't like a lot of water movement, so if you had a powerhead, you could aim it at the areas where the most cyanobacteria grows.  Even a hang-on power filter could help if you don't use 1 of these.<br>  <br>  Your nitrates are high if you have live plants in the tank.  They should be taking up the ammonia and nitrate, so the fact that you have 20-30ppm, you really do need to cut back on how much you feed [note I say how MUCH you feed, the total amount that goes in the tank is more important the the number of times you feed, so if you only give a tiny amount, you can still feed 3 or more times a day, and still not feed as much as some people feed once a day].  Phosphate is the major nutrient that you want to control, though.  If you have, or would change your filtration to a hang-on power filter, there are chemical pads you can put in your tank to remove any phosphate.<br>  <br>  Cyanobacteria isn't as dependent on the amount of light as algae, and with live plants, you're limited on how much you can cut back anyway.  In fact, the plants should out compete the cyanobacteria for nutrients, and help in its control.  But they need to have the upper leaf surfaces clean to use the light for photosynthesis and growth in order to remove the nutrients.<br>  <br>  Depending on what plants you have, they could benefit from a filter other than an undergravel.  Undergravels can create too much water movement around the roots, and the plastic plate can trap a lot of food and waste underneath, and this can be part of what's creating your high nitrates in the tank.<br>  <br>  Not much is going to eat cyanobacteria for you though, so it's up to what you can do mechanically [cleaning], and chemically [removing nutrients] mostly.  If there are larger rocks or ornaments in your tank, you can take these out a clean them with hot water and an old toothbrush.  You can add salt or bleach to make the cleaning even more effective.  But it's best if you use bleach not to use it on a porous surface.  Plastics, rocks, etc. are okay and can be rinsed well enough that you won't get any bleach in your tank.  If you're really worried about that, you can add a few extra drops of dechlorinator, but I've never found it to be necessary.<br>  <br>  As a last resort, you can add an antibacterial medicine to the tank.  This should be your last resort because it will not only kill the cyanobacteria [it is a bacteria, which is why you can't use an algae killer to get rid of it] but it will kill the beneficial bacteria that cycles your tank.  And if there's a lot of the cyanobacteria that dies, this can release ammonia and remove dissolved oxygen as it decomposes.<br>  <br>  Cyanobacteria isn't an easy thing to get rid of, but it is possible.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	ya prbly overfeeding....bleach water/ baking soda+water paste scrub and rinse...gravel replacement is all i can think of to clean it:P...8 hours? must be really dim:O and it doesnt matter how dim it is just a little light is all it takes for plants of any kind|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	its a bacterial problem, you will need an antibacterial treatment.
91bhiXTVaa	In my experience it's very hard to incubate eggs.  I tried incubating 40 eggs, about 10 never developed because they were infertile or shaken too hard during shipping, 20 died during incubation for some reason or other and the last 10 were peeping in the shells, ready to hatch, when the incubator malfunctioned and killed them all.<br>  <br>  The cheapest incubators I've seen run for about $15 + shipping on ebay or eggbid.com.  These hold 2-3 eggs but have no thermostat for regulation, so I've never considered them reliable enough to use.  The kind I had are styrofoam with a thermostat for temperature regulation.  These run about $40 but I would spend another $40 on an automatic turner.  These can be found cheaper as used models on ebay, eggbid.com or craigslist.org.  If you buy a used model, you MUST buy a new thermostat to use with it.  This is what killed my ducklings.<br>  <br>  Ducklings can be skittish by breed (wild mallard ducklings are known to instinctively fear humans, if a wild one mated with the breeding stock) or if they aren't "adopted" within about 3 days of hatch.  <br>  <br>  The options I would choose (if it were me) are:<br>  <br>  1. Decide what breed of duckling I want, find some friends who will chip in to buy ducklings and order them from a hatchery catalog.  Hatcheries usually have a minimum order of ducklings, usually 10 per order to keep them warm.<br>  <br>  2.  Look for newly hatched ducklings on Craigslist.org.  These would imprint well and be more sociable.<br>  <br>  3.  Find ducklings you like from the feed store lot.  Maybe the friendliest of the bunch, or the prettiest.  They wouldnt be as friendly as the above methods, but you could save them from the fate of being unloved ducklings.|`|r7I7FoNMaa	You got a good answer from Charles.  Do hold them often and cuddle them.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Given you lack knowledge of hatching eggs you should buy the ones you mentioned. They will settle down and be friendly. Along with free access to drinking water and duck crumble feed you can give them some scratch feed from your hand. when they are comfortable with you it's time to pet them and pick them up.  Move slowly and quietly and they will be fine. If they are confined off grass take them out to your lawn and let them eat grasses and find grit.

K4WJYkk5aa	If you are consistent with the training you can do it all at once.  Just be patient with dog.  Habits are hard to break but dogs are smart and they catch on quickly.  Good luck!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Depends pm the age of the dog.if the dog is young it can only cope with a few commands or lessons a day as it is short on concentration.You have to decide do you want to house train him first ot teach basic Obedience as you cannot hit him with all these issues at the same time.Even an older dog will not be able to cope with too many instructions.<br>  Obedience training is not limited to doing it once a week at an Obedience class.You have to practice every day and no More than 10 minutes a day that is all a dog can cope with.If you wish to get your dog to be correctly trained on your commands it is not up to the dog to decide when and if he is going to obey it is up to you to train the dog to accept your commands and most people use either a clicker,food or anything the dog likes.This is a reward system and eventually once the dog is fully trained you will find you will not have to use these 'bribes' or 'rewards'

tB7QK6BTaa	She could just be a nervous and insecure dog, which can be addressed with behavioral training; however, I would always get things like this Vet checked first to rule out health issues.  One doesn't want to jump to conclusions that it's a psychological issue and thereby put the dogs health in jeopardy.  Could be a hearing loss problem, or ear infection problem, or even simple sinus congestion.  It is always best to rule out the health reasons first.|`|AA11160437	I think there may be something wrong with her ears like an infection I think you should go see a vet to be sure.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	it sounds like she is depressed. depending on the age of your dog i would take her to the vet.

I would still go to the ver and check hormones etc.
P06xsw2taa	your first problem is putting other fish in the tank with the gold fish.  The goldfish puts off so much ammonia that it kills all its tank mates but other goldfish, and it will kill itself if you do not change the water often.<br>  <br>  a good bet is that the catfish died and the gold fish ate it.  they eat anything and everything.|`|qzf7A7dKaa	If you have an internal filter that actually goes inside your tank, have you checked inside the filter?  I had the same thing happen with a molly and a few days later I found him inside the filter.  The top of the filter is open (the way it is made) and somehow he got inside the open top, which still puzzles me because of the water flowing out??  Just thought that may be worth checking out if you haven't already.  Otherwise I would say he got eaten!|`|8UZzt5eNaa	it's here with me, i'll send it in UPS or FEDEX tomorrow|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Goldfish will eat anything, so if your catfish died, they will eat it...|`|Ti476VHkaa	Ha maybe you should feed the gold fish more often.

After you do that, the very best thing to do next is to spay and neuter.  Thank you for doing it, and the shelters will thank you also.  <br>  <br>  Wondering, how can you prove they are "purebred" without "papers"?  <br>  <br>  There are just too many dogs living in shelters, on cold cement floors, and unloved with virtually no one to care about them.  This is why we say.....don't BYB, and please leave the breeding to the Professionals that breed for quality and improvement, and the dogs are tested for eyes, hips, and heart.....and genetics.  They also come from Champion lines in Show, Agility, Therapy, etc.   <br>  <br>  Every dog deserves someone to love them, so please try to just find them a good, loving home.|`|aded53c56a7a761539a670660f5c26d6aa	Without papers? I'd say sell them for $0. But ask for a small adoption fee of some sort to pay for cost of vaccines and deworming and also to weed out the "crazies" looking for a free puppy. They are worth as much as the next mutt or "purebred" puppy without papers.<br>  <br>  I hope your dog is spayed before she has more puppies. There's tons of dogs in the shelter being euthanized because litters like yours are taking up potential homes.|`|Bw18seFqaa	there's no such thing as a "toy" chihuahua.. the only come in ONE size.<br>  <br>  Since you dont have papers, you cant proove they are purebred.. you cannot call them purebred.<br>  <br>  No shots?  Free...  they are only worth what vet care you put into them.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	They are normally sold for about 100-200 without papers. But it really depends on what testing was done on them, how well they were bred, temperament, markings, etc. Why don't they have shots??? That lowers the prices too so you're looking at about 0-100 per pup. <br>  <br>  Some naive people will pay a lot for those, but  more and more people are getting educated, so.... I'd say putting them up for adoption on craigslist is best.|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	A pure breed "toy chihuahua"??

dE5fs9yzaa	The problem is that the fish have grown up and matured. Cichlids are territorial and you've gotten one that is really dominate. If this continues, the only thing to do is separate them.

MSKS4h1Iaa	The yapping depends on how well you train the dog. The problem is that a lot of people get a small dog, and think it doesn't need to be trained because it's so small, and let it do whatever the heck it wants. Being good with kids is another factor in how well socialized and trained a dog is.<br>  <br>  Westies are small, and I hear they're good for elderly. Pomeranians are also small and furry, if your grandma doesn't mind grooming. My grandma adopted a cocker spaniel mix from a family that was going to bring her to the shelter. She could start at the shelter. A typical adoption fee for a dog there is about $70.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	the pomeranian is furry lovable and a best Friend indeed.<br>  <br>  Pomeranians can adjust to new owners better than some of the other smaller breeds like the chihuahua, they end to like one person only in their lifetime|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	That's going to be hard!  ALL furry dogs require extensive grooming.  Small dogs usually don't do well with small children and most small dogs are yappers.  Small dogs also are prone to several health issues like bad teeth, luxating patellas, hypoglycemia, tracheal collapse.<br>  <br>  A Bichon comes to mind, but they need professional grooming monthly and brushing several times a week.  I don't think it would be good.  I just can't recommend a Pomeranian.  They are not good with kids and most are VERY vocal.  Not to mention the extensive grooming and shedding.<br>  <br>  If Grandma wants a dog, take her to the local shelter and let HER pick one out.  That is something that Grandma needs to do herself.<br>  <br>  You are a very thoughtful grandson.|`|UXfvkl9gaa	if u want a smaller dog that likes kids and dont yap i would go with a boston,pug or a shih zeu they are all very loving and have a record of not barking so much as most the littler ones.a boston and pug arnt all jittery and more small dog like as the other ones and plus the pugs are cute (i dont realy think shih zeu's are cute unless they have a good cut) have a nice day and good luck with your pup.|`|VDAKIrPraa	i own 3 shih tzu's. my mom who is 78 lives with us and if it were not for the dogs, she would be lost, these dogs are small,compact, they are smart, and the only thing they require is love. they are couch potato dogs, love to nap, love to lie in the sun and just snooze away. its a very easy dog for someone older to handle, they are very easy to train from puppy stage, this would be great for your grandma.<br>  <br>  check out www.sunvalleykennel.com<br>  that is where i purchased all 3 of my dogs, she is the best breeder i have ever dealt with. you can trust her and the quality and care of her animals.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|WPCATkoYaa	Shitzus are good.

13xTQ5lsaa	Those type of fish hanging around the surface is a bad sign.  It could be low oxygen, but it sounds like it is more likely ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate poisoning.  How long has the tank been running with fish in it?  Were most of the fish added at the same time?  It doesn't sound like the tank is cycled yet - 6 newborn fry will add to the bioload - but it shouldn't add so much that it shocks the tank (although they are messy - they are really tiny).  If the tank was established - did you add any medications that might kill the nitrification bacteria?  How often do you do water changes?  Do you have any test kits or know the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels?<br>  <br>  The cloudiness could be from a bacterial bloom (if it is just cycling now) or it could be from over-feeding.<br>  If it is ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate poisoning, you will need to do an emergency large water change (around 50% - try to make sure the new water is the same temp and ph as the old), and you may have to do a 25% water change daily for the next 2 months until the tank finishes cycling.<br>  <br>  Like I said earlier, those type of fish hanging near the surface is a bad sign, but when they are swimming up and down against the glass, they are usually just playing in the currents, especially if they are doing it around your bubble wands.  You will also want to switch your fish back to the flakes (consider switching to spirulina flakes after you run out of what you have now - it is much better for these fish) and feed the shrimp only as a treat (kids eat cookies a lot better than they eat broccoli - but it is not a reason to feed them only cookies).  Livebearers are omnivores and need a substantial amount of vegetable matter in their diet to be at their healthiest.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ***Addition***  I just wanted to clarify a few things I said (as I read it - and the other answers - I realized there was a possibiltiy for confusion.  The fish you have do like to stay in the upper levels of the aquarium - but I assumed from your description that they are hanging out right AT the surface and not moving much (almost like they were trying to get to the air).   Swimming around a few inches from the surface is normal.  I'm glad you are going to get the water tested - that is the best way to figure out if you have a problem.  Please ignore the jerks on here and don't let it bother you!  The rest of us really just want to help!|`|yE2vM76naa	That many fry wouldn't be enough to throw off your cycle in a twenty gallon tank if you have had it set up for a while.<br>  <br>  But it does sound like they are stressed. <br>  Check the ammonia....wasting food in the tank contributes to it....and as always, when in doubt, change some water (after testing)|`|mOayTJDmaa	You have fish that naturally stay near the top of the tank.

If it does, it probably has ick. I had a betta that had ick and it did that.  You can find treatments at any petstore.  Firstly do, do a 30% water change to clear up the cloudyness.  Did you cycle your tank?  If not, look at this link:<a href="http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_fishless.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_fish...</a>|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Unfortunately some people live to be hateful. ignore them! You are trying to do what is best and that counts. You have more then enough aeration in your tank. Some fish are just more comfortable at the top of the water...like guppies and such. They will swim around the whole tank, but you'll find that they spend at lot of time at the top portion. If they are eating well and show no signs of fungus or parasites, then you'll be okay. It does sound like you might be overfeeding a little bit. Cut back on the amount and feed them once a day, what they can eat in a couple of mintues. As for feeding what...quite using the cubes, go with the flakes and brine shrimp as treats.( Are you talking about food blocks? ) Good luck. ;-)<br>  I've been in fish for over twenty years and never heard that about the glass and fish looking for bubbles to breath.
nwuL7M7saa	Examining teeth is one of the best ways to determine the approximate age<br>  of a cat or dog.

It is reccomended a gallon per inch of fish you have so if you have six neons in your tank that are an inch each you only have room for four more inch long fish.

5VXsgfLGaa	That might be gas bubble disease. I had a fish with it, but he also had dropsy and ick at the same time, so he died... I don't know which of the three caused his death, but check all the nitrite, PH, ammonia, and any other levels... If the water is too hot or cold, that might also be something.<br>  Sorry about your fish, I hope he gets better.
tShDXmgbaa	With over 3500 species known to date and cichlids still being discovered...there is no true answer to this questions. The best way to avoid deadly aggression between cichlids is to put mild cichlids with other mild cichlids or put aggressive cichlids at a ratio of 1 male to 3 females and you will need lots of tank space as well as rock/decoration work.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	In general, Africans are more aggressions. But, some of the larger South Americans (Wolf cichlid comes to mind) will rip any cichlid a new one.<br>  <br>  Go either dwarf south american, or just a few small african species. If you do african, you need to overstock it JUST A LITTLE so the fights are spread out an not lethal. Also, you should have a 55 gallon minimum for most africans.<br>  <br>  For south american, you wont have much problem with firemouths, acaras, salvinis, keyholes, and a few others. Those arent dwarf species, but they stay relatively small compared to the rest. The only dwarf that comes to head is the Ram, but they require extremely good water quality.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	The Mbuna African Cichlid species are the most aggressive. This is personal experience. Sure it depends on the size of your tank, there should only be 1 male per 3-4 females but they can be hard to sex. I personally love African Peacock cichlids for their beauty and yes they are still tempermental but IMO not as much as the Mbuna. <br>  <br>  I actually mixed south american,dwarf and peacocks together with little problems at all. Many people will discourage you from doing this but you should only do that after you've researched and had them for awhile. Just make sure though if you do decide on the Africans be sure to have lots of hiding places,rocks, caves. <br>  <br>  Avoid getting too many with the same look, color,markings, etc. They say not to overstock your tank but with Mbuna's you have to! It's been my experience when you have lots they are less likely to pick on the same ones. Just remember with overstocking can come great responsibilty as far as water changes go. You may even need an extra filter.<br>  <br>  So if you don't want alot of fights then you may want to research some South Americans. They really are less aggressive.|`|9kceDOTraa	Thank you Ryok for being more comprehensive.  Aggression in itself has so many different facets, you can't evaluate aggression just on the face value of the word itself.  You have to consider all aspects.  My first wonder on your input however is just what do you mean you are going from tropical to cichlid?  Cichlids are tropical fish.  Like Priss said, you need to understand something.  The word cichlid is a generic term.  You have cichlids from North, Central, and South American, Africa, as well as Asia, and numerous hybrids running around out there.  Not all of these display or use aggression the same way.  By comparison to typical community fish, you could say cichlids are by far aggressive, but you need to examine that a bit deeper then just face value.<br>  <br>  African cichlid aggression varies so much, I wouldn't even try to put Africans in one catagory.  Many Haps and Peacocks are physically aggressive and your tank size impacts how they will display it.  In a proper sized tank, long and tall for Haps and Peacocks, you could see little to no aggression at all.  However, larger sized Haps and Peacocks, like with most all Africans, generally don't tolerate other males very well.  For example, in my 180 gallon tank, 6 x 2 x 2, the male Nimbochromis Venustus will not tolerate another male in that space at all, YET, Protomelas Steveni, another Hap, has no problems with even 2-3 other males in there.  You need to know the species.<br>  <br>  Mbuna are another group of Africans as well.  They do not dwell higher up in a tank, as they are  called Mbuna meaning "rock fish"  They tend to dwell in the substrate area, and generally, mixing Haps/Peacocks with Mbuna isn't as much of an issue if you have a tall enough tank.  However, Mbuna among themselves is a problem if your tank isn't long enough.  Again, males and tank space, with species all play a role here.  So it  varies on many factors: tank dimensions, gender, species, and general temperment.<br>  <br>  Most South, Central, and even the few North Americans, get MUCH larger in size as a whole then Africans, but African aggression is usually defined as relentless harassment, where the American type cichlids use brute force in a fight.  It's a completely different type of aggression.  Relentless stress may not be as physically damaging, but the overall toll of that stress over time, will kill fish by weakening them.  But basic good old blunt force trauma or sheer physical force on attacks by the American types, deliver a killer or knock out hit in one shot.  They usually don't harass continually.  It's a different type of aggression.<br>  <br>  In general, there are milder types out there you could go with, but just try to limit the number of males in any one tank, and do not mix the American types with Africans.  Water chemistry being opposite needs, as well as sheer size don't usually mix good enough to try this.  I do not have enough working knowledge to comment enough on the few Asian types out there, sorry, but you can do research at several sites I reccommend.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nycichlids.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nycichlids.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com</a>|`|rKuDDohDaa	African, no competition there.<br>  And if you research carefully you could get a beautiful Malawi cichlid tank with all the fish being compatible with each other.<br>  You will also need a lot of rocks and no plants for your tank|`|MPX0f5jzaa	South Americans are waaaaay more aggressive.|`|92a1746f913197cd94d15ffe1736b2bfaa	depends completely on the species and tank size.  for south americans, if any pair up the male and female become more aggressive, sometimes towards each other.  You can fit more africans than s. americans in a tank because many males keep harems of females, instead of becoming a pair.  might be more variation between species of s. americans, than africans, as far as aggression goes.  also don't confuse aggression with appetite.  Oscars, (don't know if they are central or south), are pigs and will eat anything that looks like it might fit in it's mouth; but a red devil is much more aggressive, but not known to be such a pig.  I should add, especially for s. americans, any cichlid will be somewhat aggressive towards its own species.
w1lh1INHaa	It is a hold over from kitten hood.<br>  <br>  Because we humans socialize them when they are young, they actually never stop being kittens.  It is ingrained in the species to purr when they find the nipple, as it lets mama know the are thriving and getting milk well.  Mamas purr so the kitten knows where mama is because they are blind for up to the first 10 days of their lives.  So, yes, it is an expression of contentment.<br>  <br>  Cats will also purr when they don't feel well in an effort to feel better.|`|KxAmrVBfaa	I think its a cat's way of showing like they are content <br>  <br>  Like for a human..I love someone brushing my hair or running their fingers along my back and the feeling you get when someone is doing that is absolute heaven and content<br>  <br>  I think its the same for a cat|`|EYjsBzsYaa	Cats don't only purr when they are happy.

The shedding processes can take up to 14 days. So the snake not eating for two weeks is probably because he is going to shed. Once you see the eyes get cloudy don't offer food because it adds stress to an already stressed snake. The first sign of a shed would be a pinkish belly. Once the eyes get cloudy its only 5 to 7 days till he sheds. The last step is the eyes will clear. When the eyes clear you only have 1 to 2 days till he sheds. Try to take notice of the shedding process early so you could raise the humidity. Keeping the humidity high will help the shed come off in one piece witch is health for the snake. Good luck.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Move the hot side up to 90 degrees and the cool end to the mid-low 80's for during the day and drop both sides about 4-5 degrees at night. Keep the humidity at 70-80% for shedding and at 50-60% on a regular basis. Feed your snake after it has shed and maintain the correct humidity regularly or your snake will dry up and become dehydrated. If his eyes have cleared, he should shed anytime now. If you have a problem with the humidity, mist the cage with WARM water and cover 3/4 of the screen top to prevent the humidity from escaping. Make sure you are using a substrate that promotes humidity when it is misted.|`|5Wuoi5bsaa	hes in the hibernation most likely its winter nothing to worry about if goes on to about a month get it checked out fast!|`|NLAek2bJaa	It is most likely because the temperature is not high enough for him.

My ball stopped eating for nine months just because she did not want to eat. No worries. Change those settings and give him time. Im sure his skin will come off in no time, then you can try feeding them that night when the skin is off or wait till the next day and I bet he will be hungry. <br>  I dont even keep mine at a proper humidity level but she still sheds just fine. Tropical rare snakes are critical when it comes to humidity but ball pythons are not so dont worry if you do not get it perfect!

aNsVtcrZaa	Simple hamster tips (Dwarf and Syrian alike)<br>  <br>  1. Make sure your hands are freshly washed before you handle your fuzzy one.  If you smell of any type of food you will get nibbled on.  ((Using the same soap often helps as well, they will associate your scent with cuddles))<br>  2.  Provide a special treat ((Raw broccoli works well)) for when you have your hammie out in your hand.  Give this as positive reenfocement.  Being picked up = treats.<br>  3. Never wake your hammie. Only handle if it is already out and running about. <br>  4. Never Grab.  Use both hands to gently scoop your hammy up.  OR you can use an empty toilet paper roll.  Place the roll inside and when the hammy crawls in, take out the tube and gently slide him out.  **I had to do this with an agressive male.  He would never bite when i combined all of these techniques**<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|CexnhuDUaa	If it's one on those 'Dwarf' hamsters, they're very territorial, and aggressive.

vGTzWCjraa	I'm not from California so don't know any breeders.  But one option for a companion since you're not looking to breed is a rescue program in your area.  Beagles are often misunderstood and I've seen several her in shelters.  It's good for the karma to adopt a stray anyway.

But really, why would you want to get rid of lizards? They eat the bugs and spiders around your house, and it's not like they're harmful to you! Whatever you do, don't use poison or anything toxic. Don't use cats. Let them stay, they're helping you out.|`|F32uPjAraa	Why would you want to do that, they keep the insects at bay. Unless you're talking about lounge lizards, if so, then you will need more than a repellent.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	Mouse traps!|`|gp1ZqQvBaa	Bug Repellant<br>  Look for the areas in and around your house that are frequented by lizards. Generally, they are found in the places with the heaviest population of bugs. Since lizards feed on bugs, you need to get rid of the insects first, to keep them out of your premises. Spraying bug repellant will kill the insects, thereby reducing the number of lizards frequenting the area.<br>   <br>  Electric Lizard Repellant<br>  Another effective way to get rid of lizards would be to use an electric repellant. Plug in the repellant. When it is switched on, it will begin to emit a high frequency sound, which is not audible to human ears. The lizards will detect the high frequency sound easily and find it quiet intolerable. Eventually, they will stay away from the place, where the repellant is plugged in.<br>   <br>  Tabasco Sauce-Water Mixture<br>  Fill a spray bottle with water. Add two teaspoons of Tabasco sauce to it and shake the bottle well. Now, spray the sauce-water mixture in the areas where you often find lizards. Do this for a couple of days and soon, you will find your home to be free of lizards.<br>   <br>  Flypaper<br>  Flypaper can be as effective in getting rid of lizards, as they are in case of houseflies. Keep the flypapers near the tube lights and bulbs, where you can find bugs. When the lizards visit these places, to feed on the insects, they will get stuck on the flypaper kept there and be trapped. You may then throw away the lizard, adhered to the flypaper, out of your house.<br>   <br>  Cardboard Box<br>  A bit of quickness will help you a great deal in throwing the lizards out of your house. As and when you spot a lizard, try to corner it. Once you have done this, trap it immediately, using a cardboard box and place a lid on it. Carry the box with you and release the lizard several meters away from your house. <br>   <br>  Tips<br>  Repair the cracks in the corner of the windows and doors of your home. This will minimize the chances of lizards entering your house, as they generally get in through small cracks and holes. <br>  Cover your windows with metal screens. <br>  Patch the small openings in your house with sealants, so that the lizards don't get through them.|`|9RH0ZkSXaa	i suppose the kindest thing to do is get rid of your insects if you can. put fly guards on all windows doors etc to keep bugs out - also citronella candles act as a good repellent. then if you find a lizard, catch it and put it outside. no food - no lizard. most lizards you get in your home are handle able such as anoles and geckos.<br>  <br>  or learn to live with them and appreciate the good they do - but be careful with small children around if you catch them running over things your not happy about as the carry salmonella on their skin<br>  <br>  or be horrible and get a filthy scabby nature destroying immigrant fur ball cat responsible for destroying the majority of wildlife pretty much every where its found - you will also have to play with it stroke it feed the bloody thing and provide water for it let alone the vets bill when the stupid thing gets itself hit my a car, shot by a youth, and is dumb enough to eat something toxic<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  <br>  (keen reptile enthusiast and owner of water dragons, anoles, boas and royals)|`|aNsVtcrZaa	IF you do decide to use insect poison, and you do have cats, please be advised that if a gecko eats a poisoned bug, it too will soon die.

When rats are happy, they chatter their teeth very quickly (the rat version of purring :). Because their eyes are connected to their bottom jaw, when they chatter, their eyes look like they buldge in and out a little. This is called eye boggling, and is a good sign.<br>  <br>  As for the blood, poryphorin is exactly what it is. There is NO disease! All rats have poryphorin, and excrete it in times of sickness or stress. Your rat is most likely stressed, which is very normal for any new pet. She needs lots of time to slowly adjust to her new home. In a couple weeks, the poryphorin should not appear visible any longer.<br>  <br>  What exactly do you mean by her hardly being able to walk? Something like that is not normal at all, and is probably something serious like a stroke or seizure. Can you specify to what you are talking about? Is she limp, or is she just tense and shy? Rats freeze when they are frightenend. You need to give her multiple places to hide to make her comfortable. Her fear is one of the things which stress her out.<br>  <br>  Also, is she alone? Rats should NEVER live alone. This is unatural, and negligent of their needs. They are social animals, and depend on other rats for constant comfort, grooming, playing,interaction, etc. No matter how much time you plant to spend with her, you will NEVER replace another rat to her. Please, if you wish her to live comfortably, go back to where you got her, and get her another female, preferbly one she was already living with so they know each other. <br>  <br>  Single rats take 3 times longer to get used to you because they are unsure of anything being alone. If you have a pair of rats, they will reasure each other, get used to you quicker, and settle their stress and poryphorin.|`|UXfvkl9gaa	well my male rat has the same outbreaks usualy when its bath time he bleeds out of his nose and eyes.it is a deseas but if hes well taken care of it wont hurt him.i have known rats with it and they died because of poor care.take care of him and i dont believe hes gonna die,and from the sneezing hes probaly alergic of his bedding try trying a diffrent kind.

UtHnh0aHaa	It is not a question of watts although that will directly affect your intensity. It is always a question of required colour spectrum for the inhabitants you keep.<br>  <br>  LED's do not have sufficient spectrum or intensity to support the corals you wish to keep.<br>  <br>  24 inch florescent tubes will supply the spectrum - use one or two of type with an actinic spike on the curve for your blue requirement. I would use 6 or 8 regular compact florescent on a vanity socket for your white light penetration and modify the canopy to allow for the additional headroom required. The ballasts on the compacts will supply enough heat to wrap a water line around each base for supplimental water heating. This will extend the life of the ballasts. Alternately you could use low voltage halogen spot lights instead of the compacts.<br>  <br>  You may have to engineer a solution that is beyond the design of your current system. This means replacing the canopy or having it modified to accomodate your requirements. I have used halogen lights on the front face of the tank at night when I'm not viewing the tank. This required a retraction rig to lift it above the canopy into a shroud housing for esthietics during viewing hours in the daytime.<br>  <br>  Anchoring your hard corals on a pedestal would bring them nearer to the surface reducing the intensity required to illuminate them. The soft corals or live sand would accept less light at the front the bottom of the tank and still be healthy.<br>  <br>  I always recommend consultation with your local marine specialist. We need to encourage them to continue be there for information and supply. Even if you choose to buy some of your components as pre-owned items because of budget restrictions, your consumables are the bread and butter of you local operator.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Its not the wattage that's important, its the lumins. Thats why MH is so good.<br>  Well, luckily for your your tank is only 20" deep. That helps. Regular NO florescents are out of the question. You could go with VHOs, or power compacts. I don't care for T-5s personally. I don't have any experience with LEDs, so I cannot comment on them. <br>  If it was up to me, and I couldn't use MH, I would go with PC lighting. The put out alot of light per watt, and they last a long time. You really want to put as many PC bulbs over your tank as you can fit. You can mix daylight with actinic and 50/50s to get the colors you like, but you want as much as possible.
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Yes, they can and many do.  Cats are motivated to spray principally by a desire to: (1) denote their turf, (2) exhibit their studliness, and (3) be a pain to get your attention.  Motive number 3 comes into play whenever the cat feels its precious self is being neglected, such as when its owner(s) changes jobs, has a baby, or what have you. Neutering supposedly reduces the incidence of spraying, particularly if undertaken before the cat reaches puberty, but is not always 100% effective.<br>  <br>  Here's an article with the facts: <a href="http://www.catsofaustralia.com/cat-spraying-urine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catsofaustralia.com/cat-spray...</a>|`|b7e5d16fdf01ca92417f762dc4d6df63aa	Yes, You better don't let both together or else your house will get strong Urine smell.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Yeah they can, but it's less common after they are fixed.<br>  <br>  All cats are different.<br>  Some do it regardless fixed or not,  some never do it again, some have never done it, and some only do it when they are stressed.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  =]|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	yes.<br>  <br>  if neutered as kittens, before 6 months, they will only spray if something very upsetting happens. like stress from a new pet, or being abandoned.|`|NNxLypgaaa	Yes they can.

Mum already has a row of them on her body and seems to be coping with feeding them fine. Just make sure the Mum is well and well fed and the babies will be good too. Congratulations.|`|BT5otMrxaa	You should get you dog fixed after the puppies are weened.  This way your dog will not have anymore puppies.  A female dog and offspring can produce 67,000 puppies in six years.  This year in the USA over 3 Million cats and dogs will be euthanized because of overpopulation. Each year, about 25 million puppies and kittens are born in the U.S, far exceeding the number of available homes and overcrowding our nation’s shelter system.  Also get shots for you puppies too!|`|EeJMITyCaa	No, if the pups are getting enough milk you don't need to anything but make sure that the puppies are kept warm and that the mom is feeding them and not being aggressive towards them. Bottles are just for if your dog isn't feeding them or if she has too many pups to feed all of them.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	No, you do not need to bottle feed.|`|MIKbrpSeaa	Hi, u need not to to buy a bottle to feed them as we know mother's milk is best for babies as such the dogs milk is best for pups remember and dog will feed her puppies and first of all don't go near dog for few days just feed that dog .If u go near that it may bite .Be careful and after few days u can feed them.<br>  <br>  All The Best :)|`|GMmS5ajDaa	If they are feeding ok... you dont need to get a "bottle" just make sure the mum has plenty to eat and drink. Keep them some place warm and comfortable and leave them be. Mum may get a little defensive if you try holding them. <br>  <br>  Actually probably a good idea not to handle them as the mum may reject them. Just check an eye on her every few hours to ensure the puppies are being looked after. <br>  <br>  CONGRATS!|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	not if mom pup is letting them eat just make sure she lets them eat ever 2-3 hours for 10-15 minutes and watch the puppies see if there bells are swellon that will let you know they are getting enough milk from there mom|`|105x2C3saa	bottle? vwhat does that suppose to mean .__.<br>  anways.. just keep them in a warm place, they'll be fine :)
AA11457471	Pugs, in general, are very prone to allergies. <br>  <br>  If your dog develops no further problems overnight & her eyes are still swollen in the morning take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  You can flush her eyes with contact lens saline solution or first aid eye wash. DON'T use any Visine type products.<br>  <br>  Watch for any facial swelling or difficulty breathing as either of these reactions are a life threatening emergency.|`|RGqs6ySGaa	i have a puggles name axel. hes the boss. lol<br>  but take him ASAP to a veteranarian. or pet hospital. <br>  but puggles are great dog's arent they???|`|jaGwCbruaa	If it happened suddenly, first questions:<br>  <br>  1. food change?<br>  <br>  2. any new sprays in the house? including hair sprays and floor cleaner "swifters" even new carpeting.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of environmental reasons for dogs getting sick, SOME of them are our own changes in the house. <br>  <br>  Think back to what changed for you first and then it might be an allergic reaction to what changed.<br>  <br>  But your vet will/should ask these same questions. :)|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	sounds like pink eye or maybe just a eye infection but with out treatment she could go blind
cGRyDCpQaa	It all depends where you live, what type of feed you purchase, who you hire to do maintenance, and if you're boarding or not.<br>  <br>  For one horse, per year, we board for $4,500. This covers hay and grain prices. They also water and turnout upon request. I have access to full facility and they provide stall shavings. It's a cheap barn for the area.<br>  <br>  We pay around $360 to get two shoes reset, and $180 a year to get his hooves trimmed. Our farrier is really cheap.<br>  <br>  We pay $70 for dentist.<br>  About $210 for worming.<br>  & at least a couple hundred for shots.<br>  $600 for someone else to clean the stall.<br>  <br>  There's the chance that anything can go wrong at any time. You need money for emergency vet bills (& vet bills in general of course,) which can go over $1,000 in a short amount of time. It all depends on the vet themselves and what ends up wrong with the horses. Our vet charges $100 just to look at a horse.<br>  <br>  If you're taking lessons and showing expect to pay a lot more as well. You'll also need money for barn/upkeep supplies, and tack if you're riding.<br>  <br>  If you're unsure you won't be able to financially support the horses, don't even get them. & if you don't know much about horses, then leave it up to someone who knows what they're doing.|`|iynxbd9Daa	ummm... quite a bit.<br>  if your not sure your financially stable enough to own a horse (let alone 3) then you probaly shouldnt.
735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I don't know how much land you have, but I suggest that you compost the manure, then sell it.  I have seven horses. I have mountains of compost. I also have several acres of market gardens, so we use what we produce.  You can compost by making a large pile. It needs to be turned over to mix air back in and needs to have enough moisture.  Adding weeds or spoiled hay will give needed carbon to use with the nitrogen in the manure.  <br>  <br>  Here is a good article about the reasons for composting:<br>  <a href="http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/horsecompost.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/horsec...</a><br>  Less odor, less bulk after composting, better for garden use.|`|GIAwQrH3aa	bury it lol|`|OxoumjYJaa	>.> This is gonna be the weirdest Question i have ever answered....POOP?! >.<<br>  Ok....well go to craigslist.com and then post an add saying Free Horse droppings/dumlings/poo/poop/tatter tots/stinkys/sht/crap/dumpping/ what ever <.< <br>  Some people even burn the poop!<br>  Or you could smash it in your face? <.< Sorry...i could not resist! x]|`|jK6PzGM4aa	sell it to people who want it for their garden<br>  <br>  or who knows, these days you could probably sell it on Ebay.

YnCUyvK7aa	Don't feed him feeder goldfish.  They aren't very nutritious, and contain a lot of fat, which will make him gain more fat in return.  That would be the same as you eating ice cream as the main part of your diet.  Feeder fish in general aren't a good choice, as they're not well cared for, and any diseases or parasites they have will be passed on to your puffer, especially if you don't have him in a moderate to high salinity [you should keep them in a brackish tank, not freshwater].  If you wanted to breed your own feeders, that would be better.  Both guppies and mollies will breed quickly and will tolerate the same salt levels your puffer needs, so they won't die within a few hours if they don't get eaten like a goldfish will.<br>  <br>  You can also give him frozen fish, shrimp [with the shells on will help keep his teeth worn down] and any seafood that's raw either from the pet store or from the supermarket.  Live snails or ghost shrimp are another food item you can breed yourself.<br>  <br>  Usually how much the fish will eat within a few minutes is a good way to judge how much to feed.  But with puffers, you also can look at their shape.  You want their bellied to be rounded but not to the point that they look obese after they've eaten, and you don't want to let them get to the point where their bellies look sunken in.  That can be a sign of underfeeding or internal parasites.  And because they're messy eaters, you want to get any leftovers out of the tank soon after they've eaten or the extra food will increase the ammonia levels in your tank, and puffers are sensitive to ammonia.|`|AA11708471	feeder fish are not proper fish food|`|nbtVuFVNaa	...wats well grown? in inches? snails r best...either buy them or go to a petsmart and ask them for the free snails roaming about their tanks...we will be happy to give the little pests to you:D...no goldfish:O bad diseases...minnows if u really want to other wise snails and other crustaceans:D
lTsDwY9Paa	Sounds like she's in heat. Get her spayed and you'll never have that problem again and you won't have to worry about kittens.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	yes - you need to get her spayed and i promise she'll stop making all those funny noises and rubbing her butt on things!<br>  <br>  =)|`|Yzjlxctbaa	Is your cat spayed? If not, it sounds like she could be in heat (Ready to mate; have kittens). That's the same exact way my cat acted before she was spayed. All the loud meowing, and funny butt walking. Then she would just stop after a little while, and go on as if nothing happened, until it started all over again. If you take her to the vet and get her spayed (If she's not already spayed, that is), I promise you the all strange behavior will stop. Good luck! :-)|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	She is in season!! or on heat. She wants a boy to come her way. These are sure signs and she probably is hanging her tail to one side too. You could have weeks of this!<br>  You need to get her desexed asap. Some vets wont  spey her while she is like this, and would rather wait for her to stop showing signs. Speying them while they are in "heat" is a more risky surgery but it can be done.|`|28WPZ06Jaa	It's very possible that she is in heat. I have a female cat that just got spayed, and when she was in heat, she was doing the same sort of stuff. Get her spayed. If she's already been spayed, then I'm not really sure. You should call your vet's office and see what they think.<br>  Hope I helped.
8Rn2pX4jaa	It depends on how deep the mud is in your paddocks and what your ground is like.  We live in the Northwest where we have a lot of rain and clay ground.  Managing paddocks is more difficult that just putting down hogs fuel because the ground gets so soft that it all turns to mud.  <br>  <br>  So... here is our solution and it is a lot of work.  We removed the mud with a tractor (or if you do it when the ground is hard you can skip this step).  Got down to hard ground and laid down some pebble gravel.  The kind used in drain fields.  Then we put down a layer of landscape fabric, and put crushed gravel on top.  On top of that we put some hogs fuel or shavings to make it a little softer on their feet.  We put that at the really muddy areas (where you feed or where they come in and out).  <br>  <br>  It was a lot of work, but where we live it was the only solution.  I have heard of people putting lots of hogs fuel (wood chips) down and if you have really hard packed clay that might work.  I have heard of others that have done what we did above, but instead of gravel on the top layer they planted grass.  That takes a year to get the desired result and you have to keep your horse off of the paddock till the grass grows.  Not very realistic for most people.<br>  <br>  Good luck... mud is the worst part of owning horses!|`|AA10247494	How large are the paddocks? First of all the paddocks need to be drained or allowed to dry and then leveled off with a tractor or dozer (if a fairly large paddock, 1/4 of an acre size approximately) or a shovel or small tractor (if a small paddock) with a slight grade towards one side or towards one corner for future drainage. Then in the case of a large paddock I'd plant some tough burmuda if possible and keep the horses off of it until it grows in. It'll prevent washout and keep it from getting too muddy. If it's a small paddock I'd consider a base layer of small pea gravel and then a layer of sand and then something like wood shavings. Or you can get a the recycyled rubber they sell for playgrounds (Lowes carries it in 50lb bags) and use that over your sand or gravel. It stays good forever and washes. Many people use it in outdoor arenas.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Depending on where you live and the depth of your aquifers, excavation can be under federal, state, or local regulation.  We did excavating 3 feet down, laid geotextile, and layered large rock, smaller rock, gravel and then agricultural lime over top inside of and all around our run in shed.  It is the only way to drain the ground and prevent mud.  You can also use pea gravel as the top layer. You should also then have a heavy duty compressor to level the surface evenly. If you put clay or sand at the top, it does sink into the rock and clog the drainage over time, but using a geotextile barrier can help to reduce that.  Organic materials decompose and can turn back to mud.  I'm only addressing the creation of mud free areas.  My pastures have hills so they drain naturally.|`|px27V5N9aa	Have a couple truckloads of sand brought in and dumped in the middle of the paddock to create a hill like area.  <br>  Rake it out to make it flat enough for the horses to lay down but keep it up high enough so it doesn't get flooded.<br>  Do this in the summer when it's dry.  Once you do this, the spring time will provide them a spot to get up out of the mud (feed them their hay up on this hill)<br>  <br>  For now...you can get a few sheets of OSB board for them to stand on while they eat their hay.<br>  I got wood pallets, screwed them together then I laid the OSB ontop of that and screwed them into the pallets.  I made like a huge deck.<br>  This is where they eat their hay and stand to get out of the mud if they need to.
ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	a vet needs to diagnois your dog for heart worms.  Since he's been off heartworm medicine for 6 months , he needs to be checked for the worm before he's put back on medicine to prevent them.  If put back on the preventive medicine and he has the worm, it could kill him.  I would think that for 150$ that would of been one of the tests.  One sympton of heartworms is a deep cough.|`|qioH81tiaa	Prevention - a few dollars a month.<br>  <br>  Testing - $150<br>  <br>  Cure - $500 upwards.<br>  <br>  Thus the old adage, and ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br>  <br>  No, there is no way to treat or test for this yourself.  By the time you see any symptoms, your dog will be too sick for any treatment to work.  And it will die a very slow, horrible death.  Yes, I'm being harsh - and on purpose.  Find the $150, get the blood work done, and hope your dog tests negative.  Then find the few dollars a month for the pills.|`|NbvTyN7saa	There is no easier or cheaper way to get rid of heartworm. There are a variety of herbal remedies that can replace the meds but they are not cheaper and need to be prescribed by someone who has a clue.<br>  <br>  If the vet said your pup is fine, why are you looking for solutions to a non-issue?  It seems everything is fine.  Enjoy and save up for the meds so that you don't have to stress out like this in the future.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	This is discouraging.  Really, the cost of heartworm preventative is so much less than the cost of treating heartworms if your dogs should get it.  Although, ironically, sometimes the treatment is the preventative.  But, $500 to treat heartworm, quite honestly, if the the dog tests positive and you can get it treated for that much, that's a bargain.  In a lot of cases you're looking at more like $1500. <br>  <br>  But the hard truth is that, if your dog has heartworms and you do not treat it, the dog will die.  That is a certainty.<br>  <br>  If the dog is negative, figure out a way to get it it's monthly pill.  It is THAT important.|`|cqLYkuz8aa	The test for heartworm is a blood test. The test is generally done at the vets office and is usually not that expensive. Treating heartworm is very expensive and hard on your dog. The best thing you can do is prevent the disease. Get your dog back on whatever your veterinarian recommends for heartworm prevention if you live in an area with heartworm|`|sQOXjKFNaa	If you are truly honest.  It takes 8 months fro your dog to contract heartworm.  Before that the script. is to treat with heart wrom pills. This will kill the microflia before it gets to the heart!|`|ZNyDWdMNaa	Heartworm preventative is actually FAR cheaper than treating the disease & its complications.  In fact, almost any standard preventative treatment  (vaccinations, spaying/neutering, etc) is MUCH, MUCH cheaper than treating the problem that you didn't prevent.  <br>  <br>  If you want to have a dog, please make a budget for the basic preventative care so that you don't have to see your vet except for annual exams. Pet ownership is a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  If your EXAM alone was really $150, that seems rather high.  Are you sure there weren't other regular services included??<br>  <br>  Please don't complain about the high cost of pet ownership-- most people really can afford the basics if they plan.  IE, how much do you spend on extraneous things like cigarettes, eating out, going out to movies, bars, etc???  If you cut back slightly in those areas, you will be able to pay for the basics that your dog deserves.|`|1xRGDQm5aa	No there is no other way than to go through with treatment, if your dog does have heartworms.  I worked at a vet, and know it can even cost you up to $1000 at the most when you include each shot, hospitalization if needed and meds.  This Treatment is a process, and depending on your dogs severity if having it, cause be tasking and costly.  Some signs will include weight loss, loss of appetite, and deep breathing.  Having the worms takes a toll on the dogs energy level, cause him to have a decrease in appetite.  You should definetly have him heartworm tested at your vet no matter what the cost is, because it is well worth it.  Only and only if your dog does not have heartworms, can you put him back on the heartworm pill.  I would def suggest you get your dog back on them, because you wouldnt want this to come down to him getting the worms, its well worth it in the end.  Try getting estimates from other vets in your area, to find the cheapest one. Good luck, hope this helped!|`|iFWUhpiOaa	The chances of your dog having heart worm would depend on where you're located. If there are alot of mosquito's out your chances would be better than if there aren't. Either way I'd say your chances are slim that your pet has heart worm. They get it from the mosquito who has bitten an animal that is infected with heart worm. Usually Heartguard has a buy 6 doses, get a dose free. That would cover you for 7 months if you could come up with the cash. Heartguard also keeps your pet from getting other kinds of worms, so it's a good investment if you can swing it.

I'd ask around at the SPCA or animal shelter and see if they have any contacts you can get in touch with.<br>  <br>  No matter what, the bond you forge with your cat is far more important than its breed.  Make sure the cat chooses you as much as you choose it.  <br>  <br>  I've had great luck with male and female cats alike.

Their fur or coat as it should be called does actually act as much insulation from the elements in domesticated horses.  The horses in the wild do quite well because they're allowed to keep in shape.  Domesticated horses are only given sporadic workouts so do not function as efficiently.  Hope this explains some.|`|2Y5W0t1Naa	They definitely do.<br>  Heres a pic of a horse after a race.<br>  <a href="http://anhidrosisinhorsestreatment.com/images/equine_diez.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://anhidrosisinhorsestreatment.com/i...</a>|`|xHxKDQ80aa	Oh my do they sweat. <br>  <br>  Most animals can't sweat like that but even cats and dogs "sweat" in their own way...|`|0cviGP2Haa	they sweat like freaking hell trust me..
6L0tVhn7aa	Sounds like Cyanobacteria which as the name suggests is a bacteria and not an algae. As to how to combat will depend on a few factors...what filtration system are you running? how old has the tank been set up as a marine tank? how many powerheads do you have and what are their rated LPH/GPH output and how much water does your tank hold (dimensions if you prefer)?|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You have red slime (Cyanobacteria). DO NOT STIR IT UP!!! that just spreads it all over the place..<br>  You need to siphon it out. Check your nitrate levels, and make sure you have plenty of water flow. If you have fish to feed, cut back on it.<br>  Do some water changes, and siphon out as much of the slime as you can. What kind of filtration do you have? Why do you have gravel? That just traps detritus and causes high nitrate levels.|`|LHSrsHIQaa	Well usually the growth of algae is started when the tank is placed in full sunlight. If that is the case, you need to wait until your next time of tank cleaning and move the tank somewhere else. You could check with the people who sold you your fish and you could ask them also if your fish or filter would have anything to do with this. Hope this helps!|`|z69rzdJZaa	Check your water. If you don't have the test kits, take a water sample to your fish store.<br>  Do you have snails? Especially sand sifter snails?<br>  Are you doing your weekly 20% water changes?<br>  Are you over cleaning your filters? You should just slosh the filter media in salt water ( I use some water that I have pulled from my tank, that way I am not wasting that expensive salt!) Never rinse in tap water! You kill too much good bacteria.<br>  Do you have any macro? It is seaweed looking plant life. I get a few spots here and there, but nothing severe.<br>  How long has your tank been set up?<br>  What kinds of fish/ sea life do you have in it?<br>  What type of lighting do you have on it? Normal algae control is by turning the lights off and reducing the time each day the lights are on, like instead of 12 hours a day, cut it down to 8 hours a day, until the algae is under control.<br>  If your tank is geeting sunlight from a window, you can put a heavier curtain on the window or put a sheild on the side of the tank that gets the light.<br>  Hermit crabs only eat algae if they are starving, so don't depend on them for that.|`|vVAwFgcJaa	Cyano is a real pest! Syphon as much as you can, do regular water change, reduce feeding. <br>  Check your filtration. Make sure it does the job. <br>  <br>  I got rid of that problem by doing this and using Metal Gone. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with that!
a2cjwMKcaa	If you want to breed the White Clouds then go and buy second tank, a 10 gal will be fine and fairly cheap. Put some white clouds in, add 1/2 a tankfull of Java moss and wait. They are really easy to breed, but it wont work in a community tank, everything you have apart from the WCs will eat the eggs and fry. You can leave White Clouds in the tank with their fry, they wont eat them.<br>  <br>  Also watch the Angles and Silver dollars, they will get MUCH bigger and may eat teh smaller fish.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|gHKJmygoaa	you should remove them to a tank with the same conditions, or even better, you should put the adults into a separate tank for spawning, then remove the parents from that tank and raise the fry in that separate tank. <br>  <br>  Also, you should get at least 5 more tetras because they are schooling fish and need other tetras to thrive.|`|LHSrsHIQaa	Whoa, this is certainly a tricky situation for you! First, I would go to Google and search White Clouds Breeding Symptoms or something to see if what you are observing, is actually them breeding. When you see the Female get large with her babies, get a space divider for your tank and put her in that side by herself. That way, when the babies are born, you can remove her and put her in the other side and they won't be eaten. Also check out other ways on Google that might help you to care for the little ones if that is the case. Hope this helps. If the Female IS pregnant, congratulations! You are taking wonderful care of your fish, my friend!|`|RGqs6ySGaa	just make sure there is no fin nipping if there is remove the culprit permantely to another tank.
vGTzWCjraa	Try browsing through www.chickencrossing.com.  They have a section on Road Island Reds and mentioned that they're not always the friendliest birds.  Could you possibly run a panel of wire to divide your coop in two?  Maybe seperation is the only solution.  Try this site and it might have a discussion board to help more.
L0mVDp5Yaa	He probably just crawled through something greasy or oily on his adventure around the house.  They are small animals, it doesn't take very much grease or oil to get their coats to do that.<br>  <br>  You can wipe him off with a warm (not hot) water dampened paper towel, or you can buy wipes specially made for cleaning hamsters at a pet supply store.  They'll be "deodorizing" but it should do the trick.  A lot of pet stores also have dry foam baths you can buy for your hamsters.<br>  <br>  Another thing you could do is buy Chinchilla dust for it, put it in a small dish in his cage, and let him take a dust bath.  This is what dwarf hamsters really like, and it keeps their coats in prime condition.|`|UXfvkl9gaa	its because the oil from your hands it happens to my hamster too,and she dont look to pretty after words.
TU6NZTtQaa	Absolutely!  I do it all the time.  They're useless for commercial properties though; you've got to call the emus in on that one.|`|J6v0DRquaa	No. They may help move stuff around to stack up stuff in a specific way.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there are so few of them left and we let them build houses, there won't enough houses built.|`|VTNXxBnfaa	The elephants were not designing the house, or deciding how to put pieces together.  I suspect they were doing heavy lifting, holding heavy things where the trainer told them to, things like that.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Dammit!  I got tricked by a troll!  Good job.
YZhZc43uaa	no, it shouldn't kill him/her. It will hurt though. Most scorpions available in the pet trade are fairly harmless (think like a bee sting) and very few in the wild can cause serious harm. <br>  <br>  The only two I would be worried about are "death-stalker scorpions" and "yellow fat tails" which can cause severe nausia, pain and on occasion death. It might kill the person if they are:<br>  Allergic<br>  Very old and frail<br>  already very sick from some disease<br>  <br>  So I would not put one in someones shoe because it could do some damage. You could possibly even be charged with assault. Its a mean thing to do to the person as well as the scorpion and could wind you up in jail or with a heavy fine. Maybe even in trouble with PETA.|`|dWR4amlGaa	small ones are extremly dangerous.. i wouldn't do it, that and either way you would have to rush the guy to the hospital and if he doesnt have insurance it can be quite a  costly/painful prank... that and he will most likly crush the scorpion so all in all... DONT|`|ONJEMakqaa	yes they will most likely die and you will be charged with first degree murder, even if it was a "joke".<br>  <br>  and if they live you'll be charged with attempted homicide.|`|guLruSbqaa	lexi is right if it stings the person you could face charges. Why do you want to harm this person?|`|snM3heVIaa	No, the person stung will probably not die. It will hurt like heck, but that is about it. <br>  Will the person kick your butt for putting it in there shoe? If so, then ya, you'll be in trouble.
8NSh1D4Maa	I think feeding a proper diet eliminates the need for a 'special' diet in pretty much all cases.  Most truly quality foods are allergy-friendly and designed to support and promote general health.  You'll see 'special' prescription foods for weight loss, lactating females, hair and coat condition, digestive health, and all sorts of other conditions that shouldn't need 'special' foods.  Your pet's fat?  Feed less, exercise more, maybe switch to a senior formula (which most all premium brands make).  Pregnant/lactating?  Quality puppy formula.  Poor coat condition?  Feed something that isn't junk!  Digestive issues: Shouldn't occur on a quality diet unless your dog has allergies to a food ingredient (solved with a quality limited ingredient food) or there's something major going on that wouldn't be solved by a diet change to begin with!  There are very very very few conditions that would benefit from a special 'prescription' diet, and a wide range of truly good quality non-prescription foods to choose from that are appropriate for 99.9% of dogs at least.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You touched on a good part of it being by feeding a good diet to start means far less of a chance of needing a special diet.  The other main reason is expense.  It does cost a lot of money to develop & manufacture RX formulas.  Natural Balance does have 3 allergy formulas.  The small companies spend enough developing a premium food  for the average pet & don't have the funds to develop then the cost of  food for the consumer would have to be sky high for them to break even.|`|mdrbkT9faa	blue buffalo :)

qBAHaGK0aa	i had the same problem. hamsters like to chew, get it a chew toy, most good pet stores sell good wooden ones. my hamster personally favours "snak shaks" (they are like wee hiding places, made from fresh alfalfa and golden honey and 100% edible) "Krazy carrots" (made from sisal, meant for rabbits, but my hammy likes hiding behind it to chew it) and "playstix" (flexible hideouts for small animals, made from willow, so great for chewing). (all available from petsathome, or equivilant)<br>  also, chew treats are a great distraction, (available from most good supermarkets in the petfood aisle) those by "boredom breakers" usually go down well (: but any designed for hamsters or small animals work (:<br>  <br>  good luck (:|`|g8qHXXxtaa	it's probably scared if its only been a few weeks.<br>  <br>  i'd buy a ball for it to go on and let it into that ball A LOT. give it treats, make it as comfortable as it can and when it gnaws at cage, open the cage, pick him up and put him in the centre of the cage and close it again till he stops. He should learn and if he doesnt, he will most certainly give up! :D<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! xx|`|QuUoDkBLaa	have you got a hamster ball for her?<br>  if you don't want to get her out and keep an eye on her constantly then get one of these which lets her roam about whilst she's in the same room as you!

(girl, no need for more baby hamsters!) If possible, get her a roomy cage with lots of things to play with. REPLACE THE CAGE!!! The bars can get rusted, and eventually possibly kill the hamster. Aquariams would be the best bet for you. They cannot be gnawed on, and they're expensive, but they last FOREVER.

FfBll2n8aa	It completely depends on the nature of your female. Females, generally, are more territorial than males, and will be harder to pair up with a new rabbit. If she's spayed, this will reduce her tendency to be territorial, but it won't remove it completely, and in some females (like one I have) they remain quite aggressive.<br>  If you get another, it should not be too young - I wouldn't get one under about 3 months of age. Small babies are easily injured by a large rabbit. You're right in considering a young rabbit though - one that has not yet reached puberty (younger than five months) is probably most likely to work, and you'd be better off buying a MALE. Another female could be just the beginning of a lot of problems for you!<br>  When you introduce them, you will need to supervise very closely, and the two will need to be kept separate except for when they are being introduced. You will need to introduce them a number of times. With some of my rescue bunnies, I've had a match made in a day with more placid rabbits, but others have taken literally MONTHS to stop trying to bite each other, and some just never seem to want another rabbit around once the original partner is gone.<br>  You need to take it slow, and make sure you don't EVER leave them unattended until they are at the point where they are eating together, and grooming (either each other or themselves) in the presence of the other. Grooming and eating (from the same bowl/piece of fruit etc) is a great sign. Be prepared for it to take a while, so make sure you have somewhere to accomodate the new rabbit until things are settled.<br>  It can be surprisingly tricky, and sometimes really easy - it's always different - you just need to be alert and watchful. The most important thing is to NEVER just put them together and "see how it goes". That's a receipe for disaster.|`|v1tePj44aa	It depends on the tempermant of your rabbit.

This large number of conditions helps you understand why a quick diagnosis may be difficult to make and various diagnostic tests may need to be performed. The most common conditions causing licking and scratching are color-coded gray in the table (some may be more common in certain geographical areas).<br>  <br>  Goto the source added<br>  |`|xu7vQPMkaa	Parasites that cause diseases in dogs.<br>  One of the main problems that dog owners face is battling internal and external parasites that plague their pet. <br>  <br>  Some external parasites are Fleas, Mites, Lice, and Ticks. If your dog is constantly scratching itself, particularly around the ears and the chest area, than it probably is infested. External parasites don't just make your pet embarrassing in polite society, they can damage its coat and lead up to all sorts of diseases, even prove fatal in some cases. Regular brushing and grooming can help control the presence of external parasites to an extent. Consult your veterinarian and he will advise you of a proper treatment to follow. Numerous sprays, shampoos, and medicinal washes are available in the market to combat external parasites. You will also need to spray your immediate surroundings to kill the parasite eggs and prevent the parasites from breeding.<br>  <br>  theres more info on this website:|`|AA11212076	most likely an allergy--could be from a new shampoo to a new food--best thing to do is take her to the vet to be sure it isn't anything like the mange.|`|G11IZ2HLaa	think food allergy...get her a new food.  a very good kibble like Blue Buffalo or Wellness..get rid of the corn...other than that..it could be grass type allergies.|`|Ao6UQ7wYaa	Go to a vet.

Nv3eQenUaa	I know how it feels to be loved by a dog.   I have two myself.    There my kids since I don't have any.   Having your husband sick and your dog sick are scary things to happen. I would feel the same way.    When that happens I talk to God.    I pray.   He listens.  He calms me down.   He shows me the path and the answer in good times and bad times.    So just pray.   Parvo can be troublesome especially in puppies so young, but it can be overcome.    It will take a lot of trips to the vet, some medicine, a lot of faith and prayers.   I am sure you have plenty of the last two.   You have mine also.    So believe and it will happen.    <br>  <br>  Jesus grace these puppies with your healing kiss.   Comfort the caregiver of these animals with your peace and answer.   Let her give you her  woes, doubts, andall her loneliness so she can have your surety, strength and love.

Be careful with some of the advice you pull off of the internet and always look for a second opinion if you are in doubt!<br>  <br>  Meconium from newborn kids is typically blackish and looks alot like the meconium a newborn baby passes.  This is normal and usually stops in a day or two.  The newborn that is in the house with you may have passed some before he was born (in utero) and this may not necessarily indicate a blockage.  What you're seeing on the healthy kid is probably very normal newborn stool that the mother hasn't cleaned up yet.  If she doesn't, use a warm wet rag and clean it up before the kid gets a caked up rear end.<br>  <br>  The only time I've given a goat an enema was for bloat in a 6-month old kid, definitely not a newborn, and you have to be very careful with the amount you're administering.<br>  <br>  My main concern with the weaker kid is if you gave the doe a BO-SE injection prior to her kidding.  Is the weaker kid able to nurse?  Does either kid have a hunched appearance, weak muscle tone or swollen joints?  Any of this can indicate a selenium deficiency that needs to be treated immediately.  This deficiency can prevent the kid from nursing properly and getting enough colostrum to get off to a good start.  If your kid(s) are showing any of these symptoms, you need to talk to your vet about starting a round of injections to correct the muscle damage.<br>  <br>  Are you giving the other kid a colostrum replacer?  If he/she hasn't had colstrum from the doe, then you need to feed this, not just a milk replacer.  Newborn kids need about 48 hours of colostrum before they start on milk.  You can also give a dose of pro-bios paste after a couple of days to help develop the rumen and I recommend an electrolyte booster that you can mix in with the colostrum.  <br>  <br>  If the kid isn't defecating, then it may not be eating enough, either.  Newborn kids should get about 2 cups of colostrum a day spread out over 3-4 feedings (every 6 hours or so).<br>  <br>  Typically with multiples, there is a weaker one, which often needs more attention and individual care.  Don't give up on it yet, because if you can figure out the cause of the issue, you very well may be able to correct it.  Feel free to email me if you need more info.
AA11901352	Goldfish need a balanced diet.  When choosing a fish food choose one with high protein (48% or better) and low fat (5% or less)<br>  <br>  You can supplement their diet with things like Lettuce, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, spinach, peas, Watersprite, seaweed, cukes, kale, chard, broccoli, lima beans, green beans, etc. and feed aquatic plants (e.g. duckweed, azolla, salvenia, etc) or hair algae daily.<br>  <br>  For their Carotenoids which are a family of pigments the fish can't make themselves and are obtained as part of the diet. These pigments result in red, yellow and orange colors. Fish have cells called chromataphores. Those cells convert lutein and carotenes into astaxanthin which is the red pigment. <br>  sources include, brine shrimp, krill, spirulina, marigold flowers, paprika, sweet red peppers, yams, carrots, pumpkin <br>  <br>  Watermellons and oranges are also good as well as proteins like chicken (chicken livers) beef (livers and parts) and pork  as well as worms and bugs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try to keep your tanked goldies off pellet foods that float.  This causes bloating.  Sinking pellets are fine|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Use the bloodworms as a treat. You can include frozen or live brine shrimp. some people use slices of veggies.

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	When you say 'comb forever', how long is that actually? When I first got a good de-shedding brush for my dog, I brushed him for nearly half and hour and still was getting hair. However, after that first brushing, I usually now just do it once a day for a few minutes. He still sheds, but not very badly. Plus, he's a golden retriever, which are a high shedding breed. Is your dog getting bald patches? If he is, you probably should take him to the vet, because that would be too much shedding.|`|KxjUim7yaa	If it is excessive there may be an underlying health reason. Get a complete physical from your vet. In the mean time try some Salmon oil It is great for the skin and hair.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	That does seem like a lot of shedding for a bulldog.  How old is your dog?  The older a dog gets the more it sheds.  My sister has a long coated chihuahua which is 12 and you can't do anything to stop the shedding(you pet him and hair is always flying).  She took her dog to the vet for a checkup and the vet just told her that it is normal for dogs to shed.  She is going to take him to another vet soon.  You might want to at least call your vet and tell them your dogs degree of shedding and what to do.  Extreme shedding might be a symptom of a disease.  <br>  <br>  Could the shedding be because of seasonal changes?  It might also be something to do with his diet,  maybe try the Eagle Pack brand or some other brand and see if that changes anything.  Stress might also be the reason, but I think you would have noticed already if your dog was overly stressed.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	I had the same problem with my border collie. I put him on omega oil.

If so, you have no worries.
gBIrmaOXaa	Your neighbours dog will not be part of the pack unless they are in regular contact with them separated by a fence is no contact. Dogs need contact to establish their pack and the pack order can change for example if you removed the ''top dog'' and brought him back a yr later he would probably not be top anymore as the 2nd in command would have taken over. The dominant 1 will always take top as he or she will be the 1 that warns, tells off and generally guides the others.<br>  If you had regular contact with dogs out of their home pack ie on a field where they can socialise then a different pack would be formed in a way, this is not the same as a home pack but an agreement between the dogs would be understood or fights would break out. <br>  If you observe when dogs meet a dog for the 1st time you generally have 1 that will stand tall, bold and fearless and maybe growl or tell the other dog off and the other that will show submission, if this doesnt happen and both dogs are dominant a fight will break out, this is working out in an instance who is top.<br>  Hope this makes sense.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Your family,living under the same roof,you and the three dogs are the pack.Hopefully,you are considered the pack leader.Dogs do need to know who is boss.If you are not prepared to be boss or leader,one of those dogs will.Only people and other animals in their dwelling would be considered part of their pack.Great question.|`|8GE0SEZzaa	Dogs consider their packs the people they constantly see and associate with.

0m6BgESXaa	Ruthann, the Shiloh is not an AKC accepted breed.<br>  <br>  The GSD's history really isn't based on any breed of dog by the way.

That breed was created out of old collie stock -- real herding dogs from Germany.

I am appalled that the AKC has allowed them into the show ring, because they exhibit all the things that the original breed was against. I have little faith in AKC now. The Shiloh Shepard was a Malamute mix which is way too big in size to be an effective guide dog. This was created back in the 1960's.

A veterinarian is the only one who can tell you what's going on with her.|`|9792216a2cc25dd4a287bf44f01ec326aa	I hate to tell you this but, i had a German shepherd , my best buddy put down this year for the same thing. He started with itching and losing his hair first on the legs then butt. I took him to the vet several times and she kept putting him on antibiotics and steroids. It kept going until it started on his face. (hair loss ) she said she had a dog that had been dropped off there treating him for the same thing and she did not know what it was. I had suggested maybe diabetes after he passed. She said no. I had spoke to my family Dr. of this and be thought it was some type of brain disorder than worked on the nervous system because he became weak in the hind legs. I wish i could tell you but, i tried everything and when he no longer could function like he used to i had to let him go. He lost control of his bowels and bladder also. I hope your situation is different and all i can tell you is what i have. You may ask the vet if it is diabetes, mine may have been wrong but i went to goggle and typed in canine diabetes and all the symptoms were there .That was after he pasted but i would run it past your vet and the brain and nervous system possibility, I wish you the best.

In fact, when breeding dogs, it is best to breed every other day to allow the semen levels to come back up.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	The correct answer is that males produce millions of sperm each day.  They do not ejaculate all their viable sperm with each ejaculation.  <br>  It can replenish it self quickly!  <br>  <br>  The reason for not allowing several breeding in one day is not in consideration for the male but for the female.  She will only release X number of eggs during her heat cycle.  She doesn't release all her eggs all at once.  She will release them though out her most viable breeding time.  So to get a viable pregnancy it is best to allow breeding with a period of time ( every other day) so when she does release her eggs they will more likely be fertilized!<br>  <br>  Bio lesson over!|`|oiBGMHcBaa	WHAT?

The other people apparently don't know about cockatiels, and they don't know that sixteen week old tiel is a four month old tiel. When you first get your pet home you should leave it fairly undisturbed for a few days while it takes in its new surroundings and gets used to them. If you have bought a tame baby the only thing that you will have to do to begin a rewarding pet relationship is to gently take it out of its cage and play with it for short periods several times a day. There are 2 good reasons not to overdo it. First, the baby should not be separated from its food and water for extended periods. It is still growing rapidly, eating often, and sleeping more than an adult bird. I would suggest keeping early play sessions under 15 minutes then returning the baby to its cage for at least twice as long as it was out. Second, it is tempting to lavish a great deal of attention on a new animal for a few weeks while you are very excited about having a new friend, then, just as it becomes accustomed to a high level of human interaction, sharply reduce the amount of time you spend playing with your bird as other things in your life reassert their usual priority. If you can, its best to figure out what level of interaction you're likely to be able to sustain over the long run and start as you intend to go on. <br>  <br>  These play times are a good opportunity to introduce the up command which will be important throughout your bird's life as a means of keeping it tame and reminding it who is flock leader in your house. It is very simple. Just put your extended finger crosswise against the bird's chest and say "up" or "step up" in a firm but not aggressive voice while gently pushing up and back. The bird will lose its balance and step up onto your finger. Soon it will respond to the verbal command without your having to push against its chest. Laddering is an exercise where you have the bird repeatedly step from one hand to another. A few minutes of laddering each day not only helps foster a cooperative attitude from your new pet, but it also helps in building a new relationship. <br>  <br>  If you have an older, never tamed bird or a lapsed hand-fed you will have to take things much more slowly. The initial period of adjustment will be a bit longer and the taming will go much more slowly. I begin with a good wing clip since a non-flying bird can't run away as easily and is more dependent on me. Then I start by simply holding my hand inside the cage while talking to the bird in a soothing voice. It doesn't matter what you say -- you can read the paper, recite poetry, discuss politics (if you can keep your voice calm ), whatever. When the bird has settled down from its initial reaction to your hand you can either end the session with a bit of praise for the bird or you can move your hand a bit closer and keep talking. Just be sure to hold your hand still, the bird will never settle down if you are wiggling it around. <br>  <br>  After you've made progress with the hand in the cage you will want to get the bird out to interact with it outside its secure territory. Some birds will come out on their own, others are cage bound and will not venture outside the only oasis of security they have ever known. If your bird will come out you may be able to get him to step onto a spare perch so that you can move him to a small, enclosed room where the two of you can be alone in an environment where the bird will be inclined to cling to you as the only familiar object. If not you will have to towel the bird to get him out of the cage (gently cover him with a medium size towel so that he can be handled without fear of being bitten, because the bird's eyes are covered it can't see any danger and is more tolerant of handling). This is best done in a steady, no-nonsense manner that is neither aggressive nor so timid that you fail. Do not begin unless you are sure that you have the stubbornness and the patience to maintain your efforts until your bird is out. If your bird is extremely nervous you will do nothing but take him out and then return him to his safe place. If the bird accepts the toweling without panicking carry him to a small, enclosed space such as a shower enclosure, a small hallway that you can block off, or a closet that isn't so cluttered as to be dangerous. It must be out of sight of its cage. Personally I've always used the shower enclosure. The point is to get the bird into a place that's too small for it to be able to easily run away from you. <br>  <br>  Since you are the only familiar object in the area and it can't see its own territory it will be much more responsive to taming. Continue to talk to your bird and, when it seems calm offer it your arm, or a spare perch and begin to teach the up command. Never end the session until some progress has been made -- at least a reduction in nervousness -- but don't drag it on. Short, frequent sessions are best In time you will be able to pick the bird up on your|`|Ox44WJUjaa	Mackenzie R.R: your answer is nicely copied (word for word) from the national cockatiel society's website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cockatiels.org/articles/behavior/training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatiels.org/articles/behav...</a><br>  <br>  so if you want more info about cockatiels in general the national cockatiel  society website has lots more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.cockatiels.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatiels.org/</a><br>  |`|AA11067291	2young
hC4Z8HIbaa	I am impressed that your college allows small animal pets. I am a college student myself, but I was not allowed to keep animals. I ended up moving off campus because I decided I would get them even though I wasn't allowed. You are lucky you can keep animals without any repercussions.<br>  <br>  Before you decide to get any animal, make sure your roommate is someone you can trust. I know it may seem like a good idea now to get an animal, but what would happen to your rats if you have a fight? Where would your rats go if you decide you do not want to continue living with this person next year or the year after (keep in mind rats can live up to 3 years)? All these issues need to be considered and discussed before any animal is brought into the dorm.<br>  <br>  When you do get rats (which you must always get in pairs, never get a single rat), please consider adopting from a rescue or shelter. Pet store rats can tend to be aggressive if not socialized properly and tend to be more sickly, specifically with respiratory infections and diseases caused by bad genetics (cancer for example). Purchasing from a pet store also supports the unethical breeding of rats for live feeding purpuses. Rats from a shelter or rescue have most likely been checked by a vet for any current diseases and are typically handled often, meaning they can be more friendly than a rat bought from a pet store.<br>  <br>  Your next question is a very good one, and a very tricky one at that. I think it would depend on the location of the other girls dorm. If this person lives close to you or is soemone you visit frequently, I would say you should quarantine. If this person lives in a different part of the building and is someone you do not see often, I would think it would be safe not to quarantine. Same-air quarantines are not ideal, but can work in situations like yours. Basically, you would just have to not let the rats close to each other (as in being in the same part of the building) and if you do visit that person, make sure to wait 3 hours before returning to your room to ensure that all potential diseases on your person die before interacting with your rats again. But the only sure way to prevent any disease from spreading is to keep your rats in another building for at least 3 weeks without any interaction with them. This will allow any diseases time to present themselves. This would be something as simple as fleas or mites, or something more severe like a rats-only deadly virus called SDA. I would recommend purchasing two rats from the same place, as they would already be exposed to the same things and would not need to be quarantined from each other. If you do buy rats from two different places, you would need to quarantine them seperately.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend checking out the website below if you haven't already. It is an online rat forum that I am a member of. I highly recommend it. You can find tons of information there, such as the best cages to use, the most preferred bedding, and the best quality rat diet. They have an adoption section, so you could search for some available rats in your area. Hope to see you there!|`|xQtnTKCAaa	Don't get a feeder rat. Like the previous commenters said they wont be healthy and they are probably inbreeds which wont live as long. It would probably be best to get them from a breeder were you know they are healthy. Also feeder rats could have a disease that could get passed on to you, your roommate or anyone else that comes into contact with the rat.|`|BySzZAddaa	i wouldnt get the rat if it was for feed this means it would not have been looked after proparly because they would used to be fed to snakes or something and they may have disease so i would go for the more expensive high quality one sif i was you .|`|entB7tPQaa	Actually, sometimes theres rats at shelters. They are cheap and your giving them a home. Whatever you do, don't buy them from the place that sells them as feed. The rats are probably unhealthy/inbred, and they won't have good/healthy/long lives. I think shelter is the best way to go. ;)|`|y284dVYcaa	I've raised rats for a college lab. I suggest you get the youngest rats as possible. I believe it is likely that the rats from the "feed" rat center are more than likely as healthy as anywhere else. It's good to get them young and handle them so they will be tame. They can be a lot of fun.<br>  As far as quarantining them, probably shouldn't mix them with other rats until you see how healthy they are. I wouldn't worry too much about that.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Sometimes breeders will offer a discout if you buy 2 or more rats :) Because it is def not worth buying from a pet shop, I have 3 from a pet shop, they all had mites up until about a month ago (ive had them for 2 years!) they were so bad that the treatment went on for over a year! ($$$$$) and they have all had mycoplasma (its been going and coming back) and my two females now have tumours, which well bred rats dont usually get :( So trust me, it will be cheaper in the long run if you buy from a breeder!! Also, a shelter is a good idea as the person above me suggested :) And quarantine is a good idea if someone else in your dorm has a rat/s, 2 weeks should be enough quarantine time, but if your really concerned, perhaps 3 :)|`|PGkbPBZmaa	Well, breeders usually don't price their rats much higher than $15.  Who is going to take the rats next year? Are you guys going to the same college again, and are you rooming together?<br>  <br>  If you get both girl rats from the same litter there is no need to quarantine, just don't let them socialize with the other girls rat.
H06PtiIAaa	No seahorses need a species only aquarium as they dont swim well and cant live with fast swimming big fish that can easily damage them.    Also seahorses arent the easiest to feed so they need an aquarium with a good filter with a slower outflow over a spray bar.     Live brine, they dont mix well with other fish is what im saying.    Trust me i own hippocampus kellogi.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	No.    The seahoses are very poor swimmers and wont handle the current or find food in a big reef tank.    They are very difficult to feed, especially if kept with other fish.    Better to try and keep them in a species only tank with very gentle current flow.

Somebody else should be able to give a better answer.|`|tM2Qf7uBaa	Seahorses are best kept in low turbulent, species-only tanks.  This has mostly to do with them not being able to compete with other tank inhabitants for food.  It would be very hard to properly feed seahorses in such a large tank.  Even if the tank was for seahorses only, the food would be too widely dispersed for them to eat, especially if they only respond to live foods.  It may be possible in this size if they are readily accepting enriched Mysis shrimp, where they could be target fed to insure that they are all eating, but it is a lot of work.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	i dont beleave so|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	depends on how crafty you are, there are ways to give seahorses a fighting chance in a community tank but for the beginner i have to agree with everyone else , maybe a jaw fish or a mandarin  but no fast fish
YNusCvP5aa	Yes.  As long as the food you offer is alive, a Leopard Frog will go for them with gusto.    That said, I'd recommend offering a variety of food for your frog over time; crickets, worms, moths and flies.  You're limited during the winter, but during the summer you can add that variety to their diets by catching insects here and there.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Offer him a variety of live foods. Crickets, mealworms, or waxworms are all readily available at pet stores.     If you are talking about the frozen blood worms than they are really not a suitable diet for frogs.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	he might not eat something that is not moving.|`|edIUAbCxaa	yes. that'll work just fine.

sbB0TpGXaa	You can ride in cold weather without hurting your horse.  But there are some guidelines to help prevent your horse from getting sick.      1.  start out walking!    Walk for the first mile to mile and a half to warm up your horse.  Then you can speed up a little.    2.  Do not stop for long periods.  This allows your horse to cool down too fast and can lower their immune system.    3.  For the last half hour of the ride slow to a walk again.    4.  When finished sweat scrap your horse if it is wet.  THEN brush hair backwards to stand it up so that it acts as a better insulator.    These are the basic guidelines we try to follow when trail riding in cold weather.  When we trail ride we ride for 10 to 15 miles.  We ride nearly 500 trail miles per year on gaited horses.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Some common sense and basic knowledge is what determines how hard you can exercise yourself, or your horse, in cold temperatures.  A good warmup period will get the blood circulating more efficiently, and the heat produced when the muscles metabolize will assist in warming the blood that is circulating.    In cold weather, the air is dry, and this taxes the respiratory mucosa which can't keep up, and passages dry out.  Air breathed in slowly is warmed by blood circulating in the nasal and throat tissues, and moistened by mucus secreted by the mucosa before it enters the deeper airways.  When breathing is sped up, as it is during exercise, the air is not warmed or moistened as effectively, if at all.  So your mother is right when she says cold air is bad for the horse during exercise.  If the horse has any respiratory condition such as RAO, this becomes even more important to consider.  Humans often can reduce this impact by wearing scarves or gators over the mouth and nostrils during cold weather exercise.      Periods of more strenouous exercise should be limited, and alternated with periods of walking and allowing the respiratoy rate to return to normal.    A full half hour of trotting in 10 degree temperatures on a horse that has not been well conditioned in advance may not be advisable.  If your horse begins to cough or struggle with breathing in any way, always return to walking.  A horse that has been conditioned properly might breathe at a rate that is half that of an unconditioned horse, in addition to functioning with a heartrate that is significantly less than it would be in a horse that is out of condition.      So, a horse can be worked in cold weather, but how hard depends on various factors, with the major ones being cardio-respiratory conditioning, and the presence or absence of any respiratory (or heart) disease or disorder.  If your horse is sweating during cold weather exercise, he is not conditioned well enough for the amount of exercise you are asking him to perform.      Sweating occurs when the heat produced by the rate of cell metabolism is not being dissipated by the level of exercise being performed.  In hot weather, this can be an advantage.  But in cold weather, it isn't.      Cold air is usually dry air, which means the evaporation rate increases in cold weather.  Sweat evaporates and cools the body too rapidly, further dehydrates the respiratory tissues, and puts your horse at higher risk of becoming ill.      Often the damage done to the lungs, for example, won't show up that day.  But you will have started the process that develops into a chronic, debilitating respiratory disease.  If you pay attention, your horse will tell you how he is handling the cold.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	well if the cold is bad for as humans probably for animals too|`|fcRsuRdXaa	I ride all the time in cold weather. But just be careful to not work him too hard, and be sure he's been properly warmed down. Keep a blanket on him when he's out in the field, and after you ride, put on a cool down blanket. Don't feed him immediately before or after you ride, because that can cause improper blood circulation. Keep a cool down blanket until he's back to his normal temperature, and make sure he's not sweating or steaming at all before you put on back on his turnout blanket. If he gets water under the blanket, it'll make him colder than no blanket at all.   I've never heard anything about cold air damaging lungs, but you could check with your vet to make sure.|`|GpMRWESUaa	No it's not bad for him. Just take your time warming him up (walking/jogging). Also take your time cooling him out.|`|ewwfcDDyaa	We do lessons, jump and hack in 20 F! There fine! You could use a cooler when you ride, but the only problem is that its really hard to talk yourself into taking it off. it keeps your a** real warm! LOL|`|Iuiiuyazaa	The cold is fine as long as its not under like 10 degrees. Your mom's right because if its in the single digits it could make it really hard for your horse to breathe when you're riding him and it would also make it relaly hard for him to listen to you and focus so your workout would be pointless basically. But over 10 degrees should be ok as long as you have a cooler or a quarter sheet to put on him
nZBVbVbkaa	It doesnt really matter. I feed my bearded dragon in the same cage, that way he has to look for his food (as there are places where the crickets can hide) rather than have it thrown out in front of him. As long as the substrate you have is non hazardous to your fire belly then its fine as well. But if you dont want him jumping about and knocking stuff over in his tank, it might be an idea. Just check the substrate as the main thing|`|pj3gNSN5aa	yes|`|TLWZFrYzaa	I have NO idea      http://zims.isis.org/aark/YOTF%20Campaig...|`|vtpO7ppoaa	yes because you dont want to mess your cage up with cricket parts|`|44gTtORXaa	It depends on what kind of substrate you are using.  If you have small pebbles, sand, or bark,  then definitely.  If it ingests any of those it is potentially deadly.   If you don't have any dangerous substrate, feed it in the same cage.
VDP3pNCPaa	Well, there are two approaches.  The gradual approach, and the "here they are, get used to it".  It is now too late for the gradual approach.<br>  <br>  That Deliah went back to the room she was recovering in probably is an indication that she is unsure of her new home, and wanted to go back to where she felt "safe".  A bit of time should solve this 'problem'.<br>  <br>  There are two things at play here.  Deliah is getting used to the new surroundings, and there needs to be a pecking order established between both of them.  There can only be one alpha cat.  Time will sort a lot of this out.<br>  <br>  But kittens play rough.  Sometimes it seems very rough.  But a lot of it between the two of them is bluff and bluster.  Unless blood is drawn (extremely rare), let them work it out.  Hissing and growling is common.<br>  <br>  When I got my youngest kitten, it seems like she was picked on all the time.  She would make the most pitiful sounds when that happened.  But when I watched closer, within seconds she would be after the cat that just put her in her place.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	a 5 month old boy following a 5 month old girl is not cute. you<br>  will see why in about a month.<br>  <br>  get the both fixed. like, now.<br>  <br>  other then that, if they do not draw blood, or pull out fur, they are playing. establishing a pecking order.<br>  cats can not get along until they decide who is in charge. they dont hold elections, they beat each other until one backs down.<br>  <br>  other then getting them spayed/neutered, i would not worry.|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Cats are naturally solitary creatures.

If they haven't been neutered yet that could explain why the boy cat is so interested in her!<br>  <br>  Give them time and space, they need to sort out the pecking order.  Try to stoke them together, so their scents mix, and they get used to the new scent.  Cats are very sensitive to new smells, and need to get used to them.  They both need reassuring that you love them, so try to love and play with them evenly.  I'm sure they will come round given time, even if they just end up ignoring each other!|`|a6EndAPiaa	You did the right thing by isolating them.  Keep them isolated and change their rooms at least one a day.  They just need time.  When you do introduce them keep the times short at first and monitor them.  Keep building up more and more time and they will be fine.<br>  <br>  I have had cats who only tolerated each other and I have had cats who love each other, play a lot and cuddle together when they sleep.  It just depends on the cat(s) in question.  Some cats prefer humans and just do not like other cats.  Other cats prefer humans, still other cats seem to love both equally.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Uy79dKEmaa	Hi, I just had to respond because I've got a Samson and Delilah too!  Mine are littermates, so they already loved each other when I got them.  Yours most likely just need a little time to adjust.  They will work things out, but keep a close eye on them to make sure any fighting doesn't get too violent!  When kittens play, they play rough sometimes.  It is quite normal to having chasing, pouncing, wrestling, swatting, and even some hissing.  You can usually tell if it's getting out of hand by the sounds they make--I think you'll know it when you hear it!  Give it a few more days to a week and I'll bet things will calm down considerably.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

eyKx05LKaa	Please do not buy seahorses, if you are just starting out, which it sounds like you are.  They are very hard to keep and die very easily.  The water parameters have to be just right, you can't have any current, etc.  Only a very experienced person with saltwater tanks should keep seahorses.  Wait until you have some experience, and do a lot of research on seahorses; buy some good books, go to a dealer and ask alot of questions.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Raiden -  that's terrible to suggest using Molly's to cycle a salt water tank faster.

First and I would like to stress this one word, PATIENCE.<br>  <br>  First step for your tank is figuring out where you are going to put it. Remember with a salt water tank, you are going to have to leave room behind the tank for access, filters etc. About 8-12 inches. (This will also help to protect walls from salt evaporation. I'll explain later) Once you have that, we are ready to start.<br>  <br>  Do you have a local fish store to trust? One that relies on good fish keeping and good advice to stay in business. Find one even if you have to drive a few miles out of your way. They can be a large asset when it comes to fish.<br>  <br>  Since you want to raise clown fish you have afew options. You have your tank, but do you have what you need to go into in.   <br>  <br>  To start, you do not NEED a protein skimmer if you have good filtration and are willing to care for the tank. They are prefered but, my 30 gallon has never had a skimmer or power heads and still doesn't.<br>  <br>  For a beginner, I would suggest dolomite (Crushed coral) for the bottom of your tank (Easier to care for). If you are not going to be runninga protein skimmer, this will make cleaning SO much easier. You will also want to get a gravel siphon for cleaning (these can range from a couple of bucks to upwards of $50. You don't need anything fancy, just a siphon). A heater is a must $10-15), thermometer $1.95 In the tank only a floater of one that attaches doesn't matter. It should be placed the farthest from your heater as possible.) A hydrometer These can run from a few dollars and up. Just a floating hydrometer is fine. around $4.00. Some packages of salt you will purchase sometimes come with a hydrometer, so this may help. Instant Ocean makes a quality synthetic salt. ($22.00). (When you start moving up in the salt water I would suggest switching to Red Sea Salt.) Power heads are beneficial, but at this point not necessary. They can be added on at any time. Get a quality Dechlorinator. (DO NOT USE start right or stress coat in your marine tank) AquaNova + is a good dechlor and it also adds back trace minerals to the water. you do not need anything else chemical wise for your tank at this time.  One  5 gallon bucket. $2.29 each at home depot or walmart.<br>  <br>  Ok I think we are ready to start. Be sure your tank is clean. You can use a salt water mix to clean your tank. There is also an aquarium cleaner you can buy but for your tank, a mix of 1/2 cup of salt dissolved in a gallon of water will do. (no specifics here.) Clean the tank rinse and let's get started.<br>  <br>  If you chose to use the dolomite you do not want to use more than will cover 1 1/2 - 2 inches across the bottom. (Sand will require the same) Use a kitchen sive and clean the gravel by rinsing it. Dump the gravel into the bucket and swish the heck out of it. Drain the cloudy water and rinse again.<br>  <br>  (You will only do this if you are using dry dolomite. LIVE dolomite and live sand do not get rinsed)<br>  <br>  Pour the gravel into the bottom of your tank. Doesn't need to be perfect or flattened yet since you are going to be dumping water into your tank and this is going to dislocate it anyway. Using your 5 gallon bucket, fill just about 4 gallons or 4 1/5 depending on how much you can lift. Add the required amount of Dechlor and then the salt. (Usually 1.5 pounds or 24 oz or 3 cups  per 5 gallons, however I have never used that much to obtain a 1.022 gravity in my tank.) I start by adding a cup and a half   mixing to disolve (and I use hot tap water here about a gallon then add cold water) I will check the hydrometer to see how far off I am and either add more salt or more fresh water. Since you are setting up your tank, obtaining an exact 1.022 is not that important right now, getting close is. Continue dissolving salt and new water until your tank is about 3-4 inches from the top. Attach your filter (be sure it is rinsed well as well as the filters) if you choose to use a rear filter. Even so a back pack filter also needs rinsed. Now we have water movement. <br>  <br>  I did not mention anything about live rock or any other items for your tank yet. At this stage since you REALLY should not try to cycle your salt water this early with live rock.  It will die off (This is what most people think creates a quike cycle, it doesn't)  If you only knew what things grow on and in the rock, don't waste your money now. It really isn't needed. Now that your tank is running. Check the water with the hydrom
9kceDOTraa	Odds are not likely, but there are some situations this might work.  I don't advise it though.<br>  <br>  In a larger tank, something in say 75 gallons and up, if the Malawi's you want to get are Mbuna, you could get this to work.  Larger the tank the  better, however Mickey covered a major point here.  Angelfish tend to need waters close to that of typical South Americans, which is the exact opposite of what Malawi's need.  You MIGHT be able to hit a somewhat middle ground of like 7.6 or so on the pH, but the pH isn't so much what concerns me as the hardness.  Your GH and KH needs of the Malawi's is WAY high to that of the Angels and is extremely difficult to hit a middle ground there, such that you basically are going to  have to keep either hard or soft water, and one of the two won't do so well, which ever you choose.<br>  <br>  The aggression levels though, like I said, you could skirt this fairly easy using a deep tank and keeping your Malawi's as Mbuna, but no Peacocks or Haps.  That's the key in the aggression aspect.  Mbuna dwell almost only in the substrate area and Angels would dwell higher up, and not interact much with Mbuna.  You need to consider that the term Malawi encompasses Mbuna, Haps, and Peacocks.  Haps and Peacocks would tend to dwell in the same regions Angels would and aggression with these types would be a problem.  Still, you're left with the fact your water is going to basically be hard or soft, so it's really tough to do this.  All in all, I wouldn't try this.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	No, the Angel will get ripped to shreds and the African Cichlids need a higher PH. The Angel fish is a New World Cichlid and the Malawi's are African Cichlids, they never mix. Unless your talking about the African River Cichlids, they can mix with new worlds Because the PH is closer. But Malawi's can only be kept with Malawi's, there's tons to choose from though so you won't get bored lol.  <br>  <br>  Again even if you have a Angel fish that can be kept in an 8.0 Ph level they still can't mix with African Cichlids. They are not near aggressive enough and with those long flowing fins, instant death. Good Luck|`|AA11556697	Prob Not, angles are chiclds but the water conditions are not optimal for angle fish... chiclds PH should be around 8 temp in the 70s angles should be about 6.5 PH and in the 80's in temp... PLus the fact Malawi chiclids are aggressive, what are relly fish you can add are these guys....Just google Mono Argentus they looks like angles but i acually think they are nicer...|`|McuWTmpvaa	yep, just add double dosage of tide
LOH6UVh7aa	Normal names are  boring. People want to have fun with names & make the name stand out. If they are showing,  then the different names will stick inside the judges head. If everyone named the same 'ol names then there would be a lot of horses  with the same name.|`|7bbfUYUOaa	A lot of horse names are in recognition of the parents.  That way, just by looking at a horse's name, an experienced buyer/breeder can recognize the bloodlines.  All of my horses have names like that on paper, but that isn't what we actually call them.|`|rTSwouqXaa	If your talking about registered names then that is easy. Traditionally you name a horse after aspects of the dam and sir side of the bloodline. Its a way to identify the breeding of the horse with out looking at the papers each time. As far as the personal (barn or show names) some people name their horses after the animals personality or a particular trait, others....well others I think have a book of stripper names that they pick from.|`|LLnNjH94aa	It's almost always show horses that have to goofy names, and I think it's just an attempt at being unique.  It would be awful hard to call races if all the horses were named Chris, and Charles.|`|sUN7TVtzaa	most  race and show horses have names that are a combo of their parents. this is also their registered name. this way people can tell what famous horses are in the horses bloodlines.I'll use Barbaro for example and Eight Belles too. their baby might be named Babaro's Belle, you see? and i hink i is kinda fun to try and combine the parents names too! but most horses have a barn name that people in the barn call him by. like Barbaro's Belle would be called Belle around the barn or it could be something totally different like Samantha. it depends on the horse and the owner|`|EghHVkHEaa	Many people want the horse to have a meaningful name-- something powerful and appropriate for what they hope will be a winner. The names of the sire and dam of the horse and other famous horses in the pedigree are also taken into consideration and may be influential in the horse's name.     For example, offspring of Storm Cat often include 'Cat' in the name. Horses with Seattle Slew in their ancestry will often have a 'slew' in their names.    Hope this helps.|`|DLxh9CANaa	The worst group or breed registry that I can think of when it comes to this is the Lippazan Registry. THAT group has a rule which states that every horse registered with them MUST have the name of one of the 4 original foundation sires' families on both sides of its pedigree, and in both parts of its name. The 4 original families were Conversano, Pluto, Neapolitano, and Siglavi. It's common to see names like " Neopolitano Conversano Siglavi II" because of this in that breed. Imagine what the announcers at shows have to go through to get their tongues around names like that, when they announce class winners !!! One of the strangest combinations of names which I have ever heard was "Pluto Siglavi Conversano III", which I heard at a breed expo once.     I agree with you, horses should be given simple names which are easy to remember, but not everyone thinks that way. The Jockey Club and the American Trotting Horse Association both have strict rules about how many letters a name can have, and what or who horses can be named for and still get registered. Most of these horses are named after their parents, at least to a degree, and a lot of them don't acquire their registered or racing names until they are sold at the yearling sales. ( Barbaro's youngest brother, who is a yearling this year, still hasn't been named- and he most likely won't be until he starts his formal training next spring. He's just one example, but there are others. ) I think there should be rules requiring every horse to have a barn name or every day name, and a registered or competitive name. That would keep things simple. Names of famous horses shouldn't be used more than once.     That's my take on this.|`|IUwfdjQCaa	because they don't|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Just like in show dogs or show cats, horses have "show names" and "barn names" - in registries, since they often don't allow repeat names, people are forced to get a little creative to come up with something unique so the registry will accept it.  At least some registries, like the Thoroughbred registry, re-release names after the previous horse has died (they have certain criteria before it can be reused.  Sort of like the rules for recycling phone numbers after someone stops using one).  Because it's not practical to actually call the horse that on a daily basis, they get normal barn names like Charlie or Bandit or whatever, and the show name is just used at shows.    At non-breed shows, people can just make up whatever show name they feel like without having to worry about if someone else already used it or not.  I know some little girls who will change their horses's show names almost every week!  And, some people will choose to just have their horse shown as its normal name anyway, and that seems to be increasingly popular.  You'll see horses shown as just "Sabrina" or "Austin" or "Bandit" or whatever.    I think the dumbest sounding registered names have to be the Quarter Horses - totally hokey and weird, and they try perhaps a little too hard to combine the names of the sire and dam so that it just makes no sense.  English, dressage, eventing, etc, seems to have at least more normal, simple, or elegant sounding names.|`|VmZKZjP1aa	It's both tradition and so people can recognize their lineage.     Some name horses unique names so they are notices at shows. Plus, if you name the horse regular names, like Bob,  at a show/race there is a chance of there being 4 other Bobs.     It also shows Lineage. If a horse is from "Dash To Fame" who is a very famous race horse, people want others to know their horse is from his lineage. So they would add "Dash" to their name. etc.     Most people have a shortened related name or even a totally unrelated "barn" name for their horses. I had one who's registered name was "Grand Master Sexy" we called him Rocky.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Because long names have special meaning's behind them, most of them arre named after their Damms and Sires|`|AA11570905	When you are registering a horse with an association the name must be unique.  That has made horses REGISTERED names more and more weird sounding.  However, some people think that they need a fancy sounding name for showing too.  For some reason they think that "Constant Surprise" sounds better than "Trixie" on the loud speaker.  Personally, I think it is stupid, but that is just me.  I have one registered horse...his name is "Peppy's Muscle Man"  I cringe every time I have to say such a stupid sounding name.  I call him "Bucky".  He was called "Bucky" all during his short show career too.  My two other horses are named "Blueberry" and "Tavis" and my donkey is called "Hank".  I don't need stupid or fancy sounding names to make my horses special, they are that already.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I think it's cool that horses have show names and barn names.  But some are a little "interesting"  I know there is a race horse whose name is Hoof Hearted.....try saying that 5 times real fast. LOL    My horses full name is Galan de la Fogata...spanish name.  It is translated to either Ladies Man or Hero of the bonfire.|`|P3iDm6zCaa	My friends horse is called paddle pop. His mother was called ice cream and his father sundae.  His brothers and sisters are named like that too.  I know it's stupid, I'd much prefer my horses name (Trixie) to something long and stupid like that.  But it's their choice.|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	I know a lot of horses with weird names (like "Ross dress for less" aka "Ross", "Ossobucco" (which is also a special meat cut), or "Not my Husband's responsibility" aka "Red"|`|9HzUpl7naa	i was walking downt town one time and i saw three horses named nuggets,trotss and pama (pah- mah). scary, i know.|`|5e0nEtZtaa	Horses need unique names as their registered name. Most registries, such as the Thoroughbred registry which registers all race horses, make sure that no names are repeated. Every decade or so, the names of horses that have a long time ago are freed up again, but the names of famous horses like Seabiscuit are never made available again. Names are often indicative of a horses parents, as it is a selling point for foals to be related to famous or exceptionally talented horses in their recent ancestry. It shows that these foals might have similar potential.   Since names are seldom repeated, they can get a little odd. It is harder than you think to find an original name and get it approved. However most people shorten the names. Like my horse is Sheza Payday Rocket. We just call her Payday. At my barn all the horses have more "casual" barn names.|`|d2Obe0aJaa	Sometimes its because of the parents names, or sometimes its the owners preference to have a horses show name like that. Personally I like those goofy names, its fun making the ring annoucer pronounce the names. For example my pleasure horse name is Slicks Too Blue try saying that in a rush.   Other funny names that shown against are He's A Shy Zip, I'm The Boss Too, Kit Kat Boom Bar and Lost River Can Do|`|UFhrD7DWaa	When horses are registered you have to have a little bit of each of the parents names. Some breed registrations are strict than others. The barn names can be whatever you want them to be though|`|0bA8EyT9aa	Lost of well bred horses have names that resemble their parents    Race horses have funny names and none of them can be the same so there isnt much chose    and all the others, Are just fun to make names for!!!
