Wii is stupid. my friend had one, she had to keep moving it cuz it didn't respond to the remotes, even after she got new batteries.|`|71ee92efa23f9d9280d502160680d17faa	It's gonna be tough since you're both into different things.. <br>  can you specify a bit more on what you both like?<br>  <br>  *ALL SYSTEMS HAVE A DDR OF SOME SORT, SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TITLE IN PARTICULAR*<br>  <br>  <br>  Wii has something for the entire family, you might like it.. not too sure about your brother..<br>  It has promising future titles, (ssbb , anyone? >_>)  and gives you a great fun work out, (not for the lazy couch potatoes)  <br>  not to mention it's going to have wii-ds interactivities soon! ^^<br>  really awesome if you own a ds.<br>  <br>  <br>  the 360 has more fps and sport types.. I believe it has more online,, but I can't say for sure since I don't one one.<br>  <br>  You'll have to look up some games for both.. talk with your brother see which one interests you both most.|`|9p3x3tfzaa	They are both AWESOME! (Get both :)|`|iOfKCQARaa	The wii is good for all ages. So this way you can play with your bro and parents. Xbox is mainly for war games and to use online. So if your looking to spend time with family, Id go with the wii.|`|e9TFDJhnaa	PS3 has DDR.|`|f6RCFUNwaa	I think wii has a DDR game...<br>  It really depends on what you're looking for. If you want high processing power, fantastic graphics, and Halo 3 (A MUST for 360), you have to get the 360. If you don't really care about grahics and just want good, different and fun games, get the Wii. I personally like the wii, but that's just my opinion. If you have an HDTV get the 360.|`|kWxUuKqFaa	The Wii has a bunch of games you both could probably enjoy together.  The 360 is actually more limited in terms of multiplayer games (other than online play).  It is cheaper in price as well.  If anything, it all comes down to whatever you both think you'll enjoy.  Talk to him and ask him what type of games he would enjoy playing.  When you go to the store next time, take a look at all the games for the Wii and 360.  Make a note of the games you'd like to play on both consoles and choose the console had more games you both agreed on.  Good luck and I hope you and your brother choose something you'll both have fun with.|`|rMGzWX9kaa	Wii is so cool, but it depends what kind of gammers u guys r<br>  <br>  like if u like fighting, shooting, or llike DDR, or Guitar Hero<br>  <br>  but Wii is way more interactive, and active, like Sports and stuff.|`|AA10107263	depends on what type of games you like. ddr is available on the wii.|`|1238789e334a45fa97db7ec7ab1d7d36aa	It depends on what kind of person you are.  Since you said you want to get DDR, you are probably the kind of person who doesn't like complicated lengthy Shooters or RPGs.  This means you should probably get  a Wii.  If you do like hardcore shooters and RPGs, then you should get a 360.
phDAigvjaa	To build body points, you can gather resources (climb trees, etc), or go fishing. If you're at the 3rd island, I'm surprised you're not at 10 already just from running around. <br>  <br>  If you need an energy boost, sleep on a good bed and then drink guarana or coffee beans
ssOjcCjsaa	By far Battlefront 2, because the graphics are better, you can fight in spcae, play as a jedi and there are lots of different mode of play.|`|XMgFY6iBaa	Alright one has well a couple good maps.

v0QyUWjRaa	Fifa 08 is alot better... there is some differences on there.. pro evo 08 is ok..good believable graphics unlike fifa with unreal shots<br>   .. but i'd stick to fifa|`|ce81310db946fb5f8b48f7f6f5648df1aa	Pes 08, and I work in a computer game store.<br>  For the record, I hate football and football games, so I;m being objective here. If you;ve played Fifa 2006 or 2007, then you;ve already played 2008 without touching it. Pes 08 is at least slightly different to the last one, but not by very much.|`|TiWPUfdlaa	Of course Fifa 08 is much better than pes 08. To be frank, I'm an Fifa addictor and I've been loyal to this game for over 10 years. Compare with pes or pro or winning 11, Fifa game has more feature and thus it's more interesting than the others
AA11579244	yes didt you hear about the disk that were wrong xbox will replace it for free but that was before 12/31/07 so your out of luck you can still try but will have to buy a new one but i also had an xbox that did that to so dont be scard and take a chance i dont think it will but if im you i go and get mine replaced if like Halo 3 that much

This is just like the three legendary beasts from Gold/Silver/Crystal, except there's only one. Now's the time to put the Master Ball to use, because if you see it and lose it, it's hard to find it again. However, you still can find it because once you see Latias/Latios, you'll be able to track them down in your PokeDex.<br>  <br>  cause latios and latias on diamond you have to trade

Ks84gB0waa	Sure. It's a racing game. Everyone likes racing games. I like racing games, and I'm particularly susceptible to violence.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	I think its kinda lame for an 11 year old. My 2 year old is fanatical about cars... The movie is kinda geared towards younger kids.    At 11 a gift card to a game shop would be a wonderful gift.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	I wouldn't buy into the kid's predilection for violent games, but he probably needs something skewed a little older than "Cars". Try "NASCAR '09".|`|oTWnXvFxaa	I don't know if Cars would be a good choice of a game.  If he likes violent games, I would go with Call of Duty Modern Warefare (19.99) or Call of Duty World at War (29.99), at Gamestop.  Check with his parents first though to see if it's okay(I'm assuming it's for a birthday party).  Or you could even ask for an idea from the parents.|`|K2UfEst3aa	If he likes violent games then no he will not like this game. Its a cartonish racing game. If you want a racing game get something else they re not violent but are not babyish either. There are a bunch of semi violent games that he would like out there that you would also like. The legend of Zelda games for example. Its just a guy slashing swords through people, it does not show any blood and the things hes killing are not human. You should look at the Rating on the games i think a game rated T for Teen would be allright for him. But if you want to go younger there are games out there he would like. Try game stop there reps no the games and will tell you if t is to violent for you or to babyish for him|`|KSsa2ljaaa	i should imagine if he is a 11 year old he has seen the movie so he could enjoy the game as it is a racing game and anyways the ds isn't really made for really violent games, all you have to do is look on the shelves and you see games such as imagine fashion designer, so no i don't think this a bad game to buy for an 11 year old boy.|`|ejkRZ6ypaa	forget about the idea. you should get him something like pokemon diamond or pearl instead.|`|WUwplkozaa	get him a good racing game if your going to get him one.

Send it on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th week so you won't have to <br>  pay for food the next month <br>  <br>  Get Ducken <br>  ----------<br>  You must get five diamond marks on the lid of a cup jelly. Then <br>  you will get a fun can. Assemble the doll inside and then sell <br>  it. Next, go to the Torble mountain expedition and find the strong <br>  glue.

Knitting? Sewing? (Needle) felting? Decoupage? Origami? Welcome to the wonderful world of crafts!|`|p34CLaTcaa	Knitting is by far the most fun and easiest craft for teens. Yarn is super cheap too! If you wear your scarfs to school like I use to do, people may order some for themselves :)|`|oCcn4lAMaa	Learn how to make figures out of polymer clay. It's fun, challenging, and very rewarding.|`|ZNbwtVw0aa	I would vote knitting.  I find it very relaxing, but I also enjoy the challenge of using my brain and my hands in a different way than I normally do.  The wide variety of options for what you can make is amazing.  And it's a great skill for making homemade gifts...great for Christmas presents and other special occasions!   There are lots of online resources to teach you how to knit or to show you new skills when you are advancing your techniques.    Example:   http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/learn...
1Mc6BOvKaa	If the item is Recorded, the sender will have a tracking number. He can use this on the Royal Mail website to locate your parcel. It is possible the item has been delayed, so don't worry just yet, but do try and find the tracking number.    Bear in mind only the sender can recieve any compensation if it comes down to it.|`|yJ3GpnXAaa	Just a small point - it's not the seller that says '1 to 2 days delivery' but eBay.  They automatically put that on the details when the seller selects the postage service they'll be using.    If you bought the item later in the day on the 26th, the seller wouldn't have been able to post it until 27th at the earliest.    Sellers have seven days to dispatch items, so add the 1-2 days for delivery and that will give you an idea of when it should have arrived by.    If you're concerned, contact the seller and ask them to track the item online.  It could be that the postie tried to deliver to you but couldn't get a reply, or something.|`|InLhfJ6Daa	Probably on the way, they can't answer for late delivery. You have to wait 10 days before raising issue with ebay.  I suggest you mail the sender if not with you by 8th day.  Normally there is a good reason.|`|EFQ80Jjqaa	Don't worry.  Shipping can be delayed! He has probably sent it, but he can't control how fast the Post Office sends it to you.  I was once suppose to get something about 5 days after buying it, and didn't get it for 2 weeks!|`|zL8dqzW1aa	There is still a chance it has got lost in transit. Give it a few more days then contact the seller, if still nothing then report to eBay.     Sometimes things do come through late even though the description says something else. That's where you can leave feedback :)|`|k6CSa9caaa	I wouldnt worry if its only been 6 days. If it starts running into weeks then get onto him/her.

171da76f96b54e55b0d3aadbcb2827a4aa	Joann Fabrics will carry them as well as any large fabric store.  Hobby stores like Michaels usually also carry them.  As mentioned above Walmart often has them in their craft section.|`|qxAcwDsjaa	they have it at walmart. in the craft section|`|5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	The answerers are right, but you can also make your own "fabric paints" by adding clear "textile medium" to ordinary acrylic paints to make them a bit more flexible when dry.  (That's what "fabric paint" is actually).    You can find textile medium near the acrylic paints (of any craft, hobby, or art supply store) since it's one of the various clear "mediums" that can be mixed into acrylic paint to change its characteristics.

aTqtdDwjaa	the smithy lets you make about 15 upgrades on troops, now i haven't played the game for a year, but i believe that revoking would be the same thing as downgrading, so if you had upgraded the axes, you did all 15 upgrades, and you realize you want to upgrade cavalry, you can downgrade something and then you could upgrade cavalry.

cZ2dq8jKaa	basically, any civilization that you play can get a different looking titan, but it's nowhere near as powerful as the titans in the campaigns.    how do you get it?    firstly, play a regular game, against computer or internet, doesn't matter. can be deathmatch, supremacy, conquest, etc.    -reach mythic age first  -research titan gate at town center   -a symbol will appear underneath godpowers when research is done  -you click it, then click anywhere on the map to place a titan gate, then you need villagers to 'build' the gate to dig the titan out (15000 HP gate, i believe)    the gate can be destroyed by the enemy, and once it is, you can't get another one, so use it carefully.    that's it! :)|`|1IzphjzKaa	That is one of my favorite games.  You get like 3 different titans had the end of the game.   Like if you just play against the computer age fast cause they added another age.  So when you get to the last age i cant remember what it is called).  You get like this tomb and then you have to put villagers on it to dig it out and then you get this huge titan to kill there village.  It is really hard to take down.|`|5v182WOLaa	you get the titan of which ever god you using

AA11850311	now I did play Bustin Out on xbox, but it should be the same on PS2.  In free play and story mode, once a baby turns into a child, it stops growing.  They never grow into a teen or adult.  That only happens in Sims2 for PC and Mac.  In free play you can only have 4 sims per house.  Once you have 4, you will not be able to have a baby.  The kissing a lot always worked for me.  To play in bed, you have to have the expensive red one with the heart shaped headboard.  Vibro-matic something?  Have one sim select to vibrate the bed, then have their partner get in the bed too.  I only had that result in a baby once.
ncCWnApDaa	Actually I'm not convinced blu-ray will take off at all, hard drives are getting ever cheaper and broadband is becoming faster and more common, to me the future is all about download-able content not disk based media, I doubt very much Microsoft or Nintendo will be embracing the Sony made blu-ray for their next consoles, as for PS3 not selling so well and losing many exclusives, in a funny way this may be a good thing for them, they had 2 completely dominant consoles so maybe they where getting a little to sure of themselves, hopefully being in 3rd place will shake them up, I mean look at Nintendo they fell behind before but used that experience to try something radical, I'm not saying Sony needs to Copy the wii, they just need to come up with something that is original and appeals to a wider audience than the PS3.|`|OwMcAay7aa	that's a tough question...and we cant really say. well just have to wait and see. but i predict that it will go better for sony this year.|`|ZRKVSyJnaa	Well I've had the PS3 since it came out, and I think that it's better than the 360 for the most part, i know people who have both, and they all think that ps3 is better. I think that it's mostly the economy right now, and people don't really have the money to buy a $400-$500 machine, especially when i got it, it was $600 for the 60gb (what I have). If we didn't have the economy that we have now, I think that ps3 would be neck and neck, if not more, with the xbox 360, mostly because the xbox 360 got a head start
pvAX7Gvzaa	Hi Katie    It is an okay game. I have it and i would recommend buying it. Although it can be quite tricky in places and there are the odd trick question.

But i would recommend buying it, and im sure that you are more than capable :)    hope this helps|`|TQzcsixBaa	It is challenging. Some are just jig-saw puzzles (there not alot of them, but some puzzles are like jig-saw), the other puzzles are logic, problems, and games that give you more information that you need, that you get distracted from the real information (I forgot what those riddles were called). It's really challenging, like I said before, but I cheated to beat the game, since I wanted to see the galleries.

C8NkAhYpaa	Xbox 360 i think is easier to use and yes i have both but not really much of a difference. Just get the one that your friends have the game on. but online perks for xbox are better just because there seems to be more players on live and they are not as deep into the war as the ps3
TQzcsixBaa	Press "B" to pick up items. You can press "A" on fruit trees and sell them for 100 bells. Red turnips could give you 16,000 bells if you watered it for a week.    White turnips. They area the most important way to earn bells. I bought 50,000 turnips that costed 95 bells each turnip, which was a total of 4,750,000 bells. but my Nook's said he was buying turnips for about 500 bells each, and I got 9,500,000,000 bells. That's amazing isn't it? But start out by buying at least 25,000 turnips, and Joan sells the turnips less than 100 bells. If you have rare items that you get on holidays, you can sell them online (not with real money), just go to an animal crossing fansite, some people would be happy to buy your stuff.    Too bad I spent all that money on money trees and 1/6 of the the trees grew :( I had to reset, it was disapointing.|`|8mQdCKHCaa	check out http://bestbuygames.net  click on cheat codes  It's on page 4

So you can pick which one you like best.     http://www.xanga.com/DenKirson|`|Gi0jEqaSaa	Mosin, no question!|`|mYcphPdtaa	I like the springfield, good sniper rifle.    Haven't used the mosin though as much, so if you are disputing between these two characteristics use the mosin for normal core and the springfield for hardcore. The use of stopping power though makes the springfield a good all round sniper rifle
aWEhIhN4aa	Well you can't play Fallout 3 online. When you beat it...it's over. The reason why people love Fallout 3 (myself included) is that you can play it over and over again with different characters and get a new game every time. Certain things will happen differently depending on what you do or don't do. Well in my opinion Fallout 3 is the best RPG made to date. Oblivion is another RPG for 360 that you can play online.    I'm guessing you've only played this game for 10+ hours max bc this game is so addictive when you start to explore the wasteland. Maybe you should just rent it and play it for a week or so.|`|6YeexwvAaa	Incredible game. However, when you beat it, it's over. I recommend doing a bunch of side quests and let the main story kind of come to you. You can't go back through and do any missions of any sort once you finish the main story. However, what is the coolest is the fact that if you choose a male or female character, that opens up different options and dialogues. Additionally, play once through as an angelic character, and the next time you can go through without a conscious. Many options....very good stuff. The DLC for Fallout 3 is ONLY for the 360 or PC, and it's supposed to be pretty cool.    Overall, incredible game - get it.|`|8VXh7u3Aaa	buy halo3 or gears of war2 because they have better graphics and u can always play and beat other ppl on xbox live|`|xzEeSmHPaa	If you like this I would assume you would Like Halo 3. Fallout 3 is good the first 2 or 3 times you play it, but after that it gets bland and tasteless. I bought it and now i regret it. The 60$ price tag isn't worth it. There are a few games I recommend Like: Halo 3  Bad Company  Call Of Duty 4 or world at War.    I've played all of these and the online features make them worth Every Penny.   Hope This HELPS!!|`|KG5qh0yWaa	To answer your question, no there really isnt any extra gameplay or anything. when you beat the main quest line there are multiple achievements for 360 users and already some downloadable content, but as far as the main quest is concerned it ends and thats it   hope this helps|`|gbBVscbJaa	Its doesnt just stop when you finish you can have different players and it depends on what you do in the game.                Good Luck on your choice and have a wonderful day!
bl0H3DFhaa	halo 3|`|Npi4QR7Maa	First of all, the locusts in Gears of War are just the names of the alien soldiers.     Gears of War for me I like the story better than Halo. The online, I think is better than Halo because it doesnt lag as much and it doesnt have all those stupid 10 year olds who run up to you scream that they "T-bagged you."|`|slDXd84saa	well, Gears 2 is a VERY complex game, but once you get used to it, its not hard. Locust are just nick-names given by the humans, like elites in halo, or Krauts in WW2, Halo 3 is for me, is the overall best, its not even complex at all.|`|hDVJjpyHaa	well gears of war is way better in graphics, it is more interesting, but yet i prefer Halo 3 because, A. you will play it more, B. more interactive, C. you can make your own maps.  The bad thing is about gow 2 is that you will play it for a week then get bord of it.|`|eaFqyJpIaa	Halo 3|`|3qFJOhA0aa	if you like a lot of gore including witnessing and controlling chainsaws cutting straight down the middle of the locusts (human sized mutants or aliens) and blood everywhere (and i mean everywhere) then get the GOW2|`|tuH32dcIaa	Call of Duty 5: World At War|`|HEb2nmxVaa	1st of all "locust" are their name and they arnt bugs the are sorta human looking but with rockskin and are bent on killing off humans    halo 3 and gears of war 2 are both good but i personally like halo 3 better    halo 3 has forge, and alot of game types    all gears of war 2 has is horde (basically u fend off wave after wave of locust), warzone/execution-basically the same thing(both are teamdeathmatch), guardin,king of the kill/annex(also basically the same thing), and wingman(2 player team deathmatches)    gears of war 2 has a better story but online isnt as good (they are fixing it) as halo 3|`|BSTWYNcwaa	Halo 3|`|gbBVscbJaa	You are probably shocked but i have played gears and well kind of enjoyed it! so say you should get gears 2!
2Qr8vcAfaa	Don't take this the wrong way, but your stats aren't good enough for Pest Control. You're likely to get abused by higher levels (it's not nice, but that's RuneScape for you).     This is a boring way to train, but it's effective. Rock Crabs... They're a low level with high HP, so give lots of XP - which is what you need if you're going for 70. You won't get any good drops, but it's hard to get a balance between XP and drops.     If you are looking for money and XP, then the best balance is some form of giants... Hill giants, moss giants etc. Since you're a member, they aren't as busy as F2P but are still busy - this does make it slower XP. But hey, you get big bones. :)     You could try the security stronghold, second level - flesh crawlers. I've not tried this method on P2P, but on F2P you get around 30K XP an hour, which is quite good.     Don't go for anything like lessers or other high level monsters, purely because you're a lower level and won't get as much XP, and will find it hard to make money (since the cost of food will be quite high).     These aren't the best methods, but I hope they helped.|`|OwMcAay7aa	what game?|`|dYYDXKGkaa	i know what u are talking about you are talking about runescape    for members pest control     for non members the security dungeon maybe?|`|ptUzxATQaa	you should fight lesser demons

UPHf7kgbaa	It's difficult to answer without knowing what your adventurers will be facing to get to the villain.  A properly equipped level 4 villain by himself is an appropriate encounter if the party has been heavily depleted by several encounters on the way there.  However, it wouldn't be appropriate for a fresh, full health group.  If you're going with a fresh group, then you are better off going with a well equipped baddie of  level 6 who knows the terrain and has several tricks planned.  I wouldn't go too high on levels, though (a level 7 wizard stands a chance of killing a party member outright with a well-placed spell, for example).    Further, a villain can even be a 1st level mastermind who, while canny and clever, surrounds himself with thugs and hired help to do all the fighting.  However, the traditional expectation is a grand finale with an experienced baddie with tricks up his sleeve.    Finally, a good villain can be one that scales with the party (e.g. even if beaten and killed, he has paid in advance to have someone raise/resurrect him, or if placed in jail, he later escapes).  Eventually, the party gets the satisfaction of making sure this villain doesn't get "another" chance when they catch up.  But along the way, you'll get a feel for what level he needs to be (was it a climatic battle or a complete cakewalk the first time, etc.)|`|kIqq7yIAaa	match the challenge rating to the party's mix of characters    this shouldn't be more than a couple of levels higher  of course villians have minions to contend with too  so things should be interesting, lively, and a good challenge    if the party is certain to defeat him toughen him up some  let him slip away while the party beats up his minions  and he can then come back later to haunt the party  especially if they really beat him down too easily
pcBmyGTZaa	They are both too different, really. Saints Row is like GTA (kind of) and Gears is totally different.

It took 20+ minutes to setup a game and then once the match is over you have to do the whole matchmaking process all over again.. It had a good single/co-op story.

MKZyKVWLaa	If you still have an account from the first time you bought the original World of Warcraft (and remember the name/password), then you'd only need to purchase The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King to be up to date. Both games come with a CD key, which needs to be applied to your existing account.    If you can't remember your name/password, you're going to have to go out and buy The World of Warcraft Battlechest, which includes the Original World of Warcraft and The Burning Crusade (as well as the CD Keys for both, allowing you to create a new account).     If you do remember your name/password, all you need to do is go to wordlofwarcraft.com, and it will allow you to download whichever games you have activated on your account. If you've only purchased the original, it will only let you download the original.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I've only ever seen the original game as being sold with 5 discs, but I've seen a few people posting saying they have brought versions where there's only one disc, and having trouble with it.

Also, if you already had the game, make sure it's not still installed on your computer.|`|iBQJPx1Aaa	maby|`|Sga6uU4Zaa	Did you buy the expansion by accident?

One is the original which is just called World of Warcraft. Than there is Burning Crusades which is the first expansion, than there is Wrath of The Lich King which is the brand new expansion pack. Maybe you bought the expansion pack instead of the real game first :/|`|199db98c8937bb675dcbaad5b1130dcaaa	Here is the answer to your question, and it will be the absolute best answer you shall ever receive!!!    There are several variations of World of Warcraft available on the market. Compare the following data to figure out if you bought the right disc:    1. World of Warcraft Trial Version- contains 1 disk, comes in a sleeve, costs about 1.99  2. World of Warcraft game- Contains ~5 discs, comes in a box, costs about 20.00  3. World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade Expansion- Contains ~5 discs, comes in a box that says "Burning Crusade", costs...I believe $30  4. World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King Expansion- This box is a lot of blue and has a picture of a cool undead guy. This is also the wrong version.    If you bought either of the expansions the game will not work without owning the original version. If you did buy an expansion though, you can just buy the game online from blizzard and download it over the internet (although this will take a decent amount of time).    Hopefully I answered your question.
AA10069380	First off buying WOW and TBC together in the battle chest saves a ton of money good going. And might as well get WOTLK aswell while your at it so you don't have to worry about it later.    So back to your trouble. I am guessing you started with WOW. If so try it again if it does not auto start open my computer double click on the DVD-ROM drive and that should start the install if not then you have a bad disk. Get a new one. If it works then do this for all 3 games.    Also check out this web site. So you can check to see if your autorun has been turned off.And how to turn it back on    http://autorun.moonvalley.com/enable.htm    I hope this helps.|`|QWw26AXFaa	For one, why did you buy BC and WOTLK? you can't use them till you are the appropriate level, but whatever    And have you tried to go to your "my computer" and then manually starting the download by right clicking on the drive and clicking install?

I was a nerd too man. its okay. Infact, I played pokemon and yugioh too! You should play Runescape. It got really addicting even though the graphics werent the best it was really fun. Its more fun if u have ur friends play too. its free too. you can level up your character and fight other players. trade and get money and much more. www.runescape.com    If you can spend some money buy Guild Wars. the graphics are the best ive ever seen in any video game. you create ur own character with I believe 8 characters. I have the first game so I know in that game u have a Warrior, Archer, Necromancer, Mesmer, and Elementalist. it is sooo fun. Its online and u just pay that 20-40 bucks on the game and u can play free for the rest of ur life. IT IS THE BEST. I guarantee u ll definately like it. I was on 4 HOURS A DAY!

ncCWnApDaa	It returns you to Hyrule castle again, I'm afraid there are no unlockables to the game for completing it though, even a gallery or sound test would have been better than nothing, you could collect all the bugs if you want.|`|2dPqad7Eaa	Yep sorry man. Theres no reward but you can fight him again if you want.|`|dHQtZEZNaa	I watched my brother beat the game. What happens is it returns you to just before you fight Ganon. Probably so you can find all the heart containers, or something like that.

Cloud Strife FF VII  Vincent Valentine FF VII  Dante DMC    All are good. I would say Altair from assassins creed as well but the game was a bit too repetitive for me.
lIn8Xhfzaa	here in my hands i have the Nintendo official guide.  Watt can help you see the blocks leading to the blue door and the shiver city warp pipe.  i think u know how to get to the blue door. if you don't, i can tell how to.|`|RSbn5STjaa	Easy: go to the City Hall and exit out the back, go down the stairs to the left. Off in the distance You'll see a large rock. Behind that rock is a smaller rock with some moss that looks like a picture of a car. Pick that rock up and throw it into the lake that's off to your left. When the water splashes into the air, it will form a mist that will condense into a cloud that looks like a pointing hand. Run in the direction the had is pointing for about 2 miles. There, you'll see a sign post and at the base of the post the sign that fell off. Pick up the sign - underneath it is a hole with a piece of paper. Now this paper has a code on it, something like 77E6%%QBRF (of course it's different for every player) OK ... so find a typewriter in the library in the main house and put in a piece of carbon paper ( you should have it in your inventory ) type the code on the paper and then hit tab-backspace-9-9-space-tab 4 times. In the glove compartment of the car that is now parked under the tree out in the field you will find a key to the blue door.
wM5z8HD6aa	You have to by a Club Penguin toy at Disney stores or Toysrus. When you buy that toy you click on "Unlock Items" on the homepage. You type in the code you see on the back of the coin which comes with the toy. I bought a 6 dollar toy and got to unlock two items. Toys range from 5-15 bucks. I reccomend you get the action figures.

dKsQktrjaa	Glitches? Don't -.-. Save up some points from killing in the start room. Then go buy the HELP room and get a better weapon from the random. Then, buy the upstairs from inside the HELP room NOT the main room. WHen you go upstairs, go into the little room with that lets you look over the balcony. It has a doorway where the zombies come in and one window they come in. its a very good defensive point.|`|0C2DAt6caa	Stay in the start room and only use your knife for the first 5 levels (you get more points). Open the help room on the 6th level but don't open the upstairs. If you aren't by yourself then have somebody watch the help room while another person covers the start room.
imMmbFSlaa	No, that is not true.    The Sims 2 uses different graphics than the Sims 3 will have, so the programs will be different. No sims 2 expansion pack will work with the sims 3, though they will create new expansions for the sims 3, some of which may be similar to the ones for the sims 2.|`|gg4NMdqWaa	idk|`|62ca1a09937292cf311358116b02a9d1aa	Probably not.     I'm assuming you can't because you couldn't transfer from Sims 1 to 2 , so why should you from 2 to 3?     The Sims 3 is supposedly independent from the Sims 2 , a whole new game.
0uttyT8Vaa	you either have to complete the game or delete your current data.    hop this helps!!!|`|g36eAdaxaa	you cant.gotta restart the whole fraggin game or delete data.then start again from a new game

Create a folder called MUSIC (if you want to put pictures just open up your PSP folder and create a folder called PHOTO.    3.Now find you music and drag it into the MUSIC folder. it should be there    4 or drag any photo/picture into your PHOTO folder . (located in PSP folder)    Hope that helps . :)|`|gHiWayjoaa	its best if u keep the music/pics in a folder. Then u can try dragging it into the psp folder.|`|kDrjtu0Saa	search on google

tBnJqnZDaa	You can search for cracks and keygens, but there is a high possibility that you can download a virus (unless you know how to defeat and stay safe from them).    I don't think there's a way... otherwise, you buy the game. You might already know that you can only play the game about six times with the additional wildcoins. I think buying the game is your only option.|`|NRhrO833aa	Unfortunately, as with all Codes, it would require a digital purchase for the Code. You can also buy the game from your nearest game retailer for a copy of about $9.00|`|oWUgnajdaa	I would go to piratebay.org. They have almost every game/serial key ever.
ncCWnApDaa	Well first be sure that the game allows online play first, I know that wii sports does not, not sure about the other 2, Brawl and Mario Kart wii have online play as does CODWAW, you need to exchange friend codes with other users once you have an online game, and then choose the online mode from the options of that particular game.|`|7xfRPfQZaa	some games you just can't go online with.check the case if it says "Wi-Fi".if it does,then look for "Wi-Fi"in the game.  if you rented the game then you have to just look in the game for "Wi-Fi".

You need to understand football.   I'll just give some tips.  1. You need to find a team that SUITS you. Don't just pick your favorite team unless you know how they work and so forth. Don't use a style of play that does not fit that team in real life.    Example: If the Team in real life is a Passing team, Go with the pass more then the Run.     2. Audible alot to figure out a Defense. I like to use something that makes me recievers switch to one side to the other to see if they are in Man or Zone Coverage, Then Reset the play. Then tell that reciever to run a route that will best suit that type of coverage.    3. Know your backs. If your Runningback is a Speed back, Try to use alot of Sweeps and Counter Running plays, Or pass it to him. If he is a Stiff Arm, or Power Back, Do alot Iso, and Straight up the middle type things.     4. Same with Recievers, If you're reciever is a route runner, Make him do alot of cuts and stuff to lose the defender, If he is a Spec. Catch or something of that nature, Throw it deep in 1on1 Coverage.    5. With Defense, I always use "Play Type" when choosing my plays.   If you have fast corners, I love to Use a "CB BLITZ ZONE" Usually, a Quarterback will never see that coming, Only use it through if they go in something with like 3 Recievers or something, Most likely they are going to go back some and wait., Which will give the corners ennough time to Sack him.    That's what I love to do. My team is The Bucs. Oh yeah, Use you're tight end almost more then you would your recievers. Tight Ends can be your best friends in the pass plays.|`|I8laNaM8aa	id say do some cross routes and mix them up for offense don't be one diminishable cause bot or person will know how to play you. so get some runs in there take your time and check the whole field when you pass. i take more chances with one on one coverage then i do with double teams. and if you have a feeling they are coming with a blitz throw a quick out or run the ball. hope this helps

YSmYkc5Yaa	No oddly enough you can't. The RockBand guitar isn't compatible with Gutar Hero, but the Guitar Hero guitar works with Rock Band.    I have them both and have tried it.

Ta7aaDxnaa	Really simple. Do a finisher so that the flames are high up. Then grab and drag your opponent to the flames.|`|gzRZlfpLaa	Get the temp up to 300, then you start a strong grapple (hold rb and right stick in any direction) then , if your meter is flashing you can hit finisher button to do it, if your meter is not flashing you can drag him by using left stick,then do any move and you will throw him out. Basically just get it to 300, do strong grapple,it will tell you what to do under your name
2qmB4pdkaa	Your sister is more advanced than my 2 year old daughter, but here are some of the things we do.    Construction paper, glue, cotton balls, beads    Glue cotton in the shape of a snowman onto the paper, then use beads (or anything - fabric, yarn, be creative)  to give him a face and buttons.  I just draw the hat and arms.    Draw something like a house or car or boat or person onto a piece of paper.  Glue cereal (fruit loops or cheerios or something) or macaroni onto the outline.    Anything with glitter.  I saw this in a magazine and did it for Christmas and my girl LOVED it.  Blow up a balloon kind of small so it's more of a globe shape than the pointy egg shape.  Dip cotton string (I bought it at walmart in the craft section) into plain white glue, and wrap the balloon.  Leave lots of openings - you're not making a pinata.  Then sprinkle glitter (I used silver) onto the glued string.  Let it dry overnight, then pop the balloon.  You end up with a really cool glittery globe.  Or a bunch of them.    It's cool that you're doing crafts with your sister.  Have fun.|`|PSaXvIyWaa	You can also try these sites, I use them all the time for homeschooling  http://www.first-school.ws/theme/alphabe...  http://www.tlsbooks.com/preschoolshapes....    Have fun|`|oZdIsSSEaa	Try out this website:  http://www.makingfriends.com/precrafts.h...  (Easy paper crafts that use just a few supplies, most of which you will already have on hand.)    You can make musical instruments:  staple two paper plates together and fill it with beans.    You can also cut out differenent magazine pictures and let her make a collage.  My three year old loves doing this, especially when the pictures are of other little girls/princesses.  She likes the cutting and gluing aspect.    You can buy some wooden boxes, birdhouses, etc. at a craft store and paint and decorate them with various things.. buttons, pom poms, sequins.    Make valentine cards. You can do the handprint thing with red paint, stickers, ribbon, glitter etc.  You can send them to loved ones, family and friends.    Don't get too complicated, because at this age their attention span is not that long and easy things really capture their attention.    Have fun!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	crayons  finger paint  glue  glitter  paper  doilies    make some valentines...(use your head, you don't need a website to tell you what to do..)|`|Vfio3ABeaa	you could make finger puppets.    i do this with my cousin all the time.    if u don't know how to do it, here are some instructions.      1. Measure around your finger with paper. when it gets all the way around, tape it, and take it off.    2. Color some characters or paint some, or you could make some from construction paper. you could use googly eyes to make them more fun.    3. Tape or glue the characters to the paper ring.    4. Make a puppet show or maybe play dolls with them. something that a 3 year old would like to do.        another idea for a craft is to make doll furnature.      i hope you find something fun to do|`|w1kgu0hOaa	Make a scrapbook, but on a show, macaroni art|`|SuMwWNfyaa	http://www.freekidcrafts.com/    http://familycrafts.about.com/b/2005/05/...      http://kidscrafts.suite101.com/article.c...    you could get a cardboard box,cut out some windows,get some crayons,and color it.|`|n99NOgHJaa	How about making a giant poster of a seen made from you hand prints.

dhJZ6LR0aa	that is your way around, try looking for the hieroglyphics on each island    1. First Island - Shipwreck Lagoon - On the beached ship.  2.

Airplane Island - Skull Rock Jungle - Next to the Skull Rock.  6. Airplane Island - East River Plains - Near the quicksand.  7. Volcano Island - South River Jungle - Next to the river.  8. Volcano Island - Volcano Jungle - By the Hot Springs.  9. Volcano Island - Geyser Plains - Next to the Volcano Overlook entrance.    once you find all of the stuff go into the volcano and make a steel hammer and chisel (their is steel on the top of the volcano) make your way around till you reach the other side of the glacier (the one blocking your path). us your hammer and chisel to hit the glacier, this may take time to get right. the glacier should fall on the geyser and presto.  its a fun game, but i don't have it for wii
GqHHVzf0aa	You have to deposit 10,000 bells into your bank account. If you do, you will get the shopping card in the mail. It can be used to buy the items at GracieGrace that are too much to fit all the bells in your pocket. It also can be used to spend bells directly from your account at GracieGrace. If you use up the card, you can go to your ABD and have the card reissued. If you put 1,000,000 bells in your account, you can recieve a gold shopping card.

qEnjogBsaa	The next addition to the Grand Theft Auto gaming series, releasing on 3.17.09, is brought to the best handheld gaming device, DS. It is going to be the first Grand Theft Auto game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Though, this will be the fourth Nintendo GTA game. The game was first announced at the E3 Nintendo Press Conference 2008 on July 15, 2008. The game has several new features such as touch screen mini-games for things throughout the entire game. There is one that is brand new where you use certain tools open cars and then break the alarms with a machine. After so, the player may enter a car. Another one, announced to be the first playable part in the game, is a special where you must leave from the inside of a car sinking into the river that divides Liberty City (NYC only version) from Alderney (GTA 4 version of LC). After leaving you meet a special man who is known to be a cop named Wade Heston. Wade is one of those cops who seems to be really nice so Huang becomes friends with him. This is the first mission titled "Yu Jian". It is more likely to be called a mini-mission or an opening sequence.    Lots of great returning and related features from GTA IV include the map (besides the fact that it's in Black and White now) and the PDA for the clock, contacts, and emails. Another one would be that pedestrians get into fights on their own, fights with you, use their cell phones, and interact commonly with all their surroundings. A brand new feature includes using your PDA/cell phone to call Ammu-Nation and send weapons straight to your safehouse (awarded to the player in the first real mission, Streets of Rage). The greatest feature (which cannot be revealed here on Wikipedia until the release of the game) is the red stash box. The only thing that can be told on Wikipedia that won't be a violation of Vandalism is that it used for taking drugs.    The game is expected to be released on March 17, 2009 in North America and March 20, 2009 to Australia and Europe. The game was rated 18+ by the BBFC (UK, Europe) and M by the ESRB (North America).|`|pjgQAXM7aa	Yeah there actually is going to be a new one.

Ip1vFFtZaa	i got a memory card for this just because its so much easier it takes forever to recover a gamertag...  so whenever i went to my brothers for gaming and drinking id put it on the memory card... no problems|`|3eQhA8nraa	if you want to transfer game save data, then no, recovering your gamer tag isn't enough. you can take your gamer tag with you to you gf's xbox, but your save data won't come with you. you could bring your hard drive. if you just want your gamer score then, recovering your Gamer tag would work. i think you would be better off taking your hard drive with you. that way you get your dlc and your save files    your profile would stay on your gf's hard drive if you recovered it, even if it was not connected to xbl.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Your maintenance costs (i.e., lost gold per turn) are the cause of your problem.  Furthermore, you are probably not generating enough revenues (i.e., gained or generated gold per turn).<br>  <br>  The solutions are as follows:<br>  <br>  (1) Build Courthouses, which reduce maintenance (i.e., lost gold per turn) by 50%.<br>  <br>  (2) Build Banks, which increase revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 50%.<br>  <br>  (3) Build Markets, which increase revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 25%, and allow you to add up to 2 merchants to the population of each city with a market.<br>  <br>  (4) Build Grocers, which will increase revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 25%, and allow you to add up to 2 merchants to the population of each city with a grocer.<br>  <br>  (5) Build the Wall Street National Wonder in your city with the highest revenues (i.e., gold per turn), which will increase its revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 100%, and allow you to add up to 3 merchants to that city's population.<br>  <br>  TO FIND OUT the amount of your REVENUES and MAINTENANCE COSTS for each your cities, press the <F1> key.  You will see a display with each row representing each of your cities, listed in chronological order by the date when they were founded.  Among the columns are GOLD, which shows how much gold revenues are generated per turn by the city, and MAINTENANCE, which shows how much gold is lost each turn because of maintenace costs.<br>  <br>  (6) Choose one of these civilizations as your starting civilization:<br>  <br>  (6A) An American civilization will allow you to build Malls in each city, increasing revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 20% (instead of Supermarkets, which add nothing to revenues).<br>  <br>  (6B) An English civilization will allow you to build Stock Exchanges in each city, increasing revenues (i.e., gold per turn) by 65%, instead of Banks, which only increase revenues by 50%.<br>  <br>  (6C) A Holy Roman Empire civilizaiton will allow you to build a Rathaus in each city, reducing maintenance (i.e., lost gold per turn) by 75%.<br>  <br>  (7) Try to be the first civilization to research each of the 7 religions.  Then, when a Great Prophet is born, use him to build a religious World Wonder.  The following world wonders correspond to each of the religions:  The Temple of Solomon (Judaism), The Church of the Nativity (Christianity), The Masjid Al-Haram (Islam), The Kashi Wishwanath (Hinduism), The Mahabodhi (Buddhism), The Kong Miao (Confucianism), The Dai Miao (Taoism).  When you have these world wonders, the city in which they are built receives 1 gold unit (revenue) per turn for each city into which that religion has spread.<br>  <br>  (8) Add as many merchants to the population of as many cities as possible.  Each merchant adds 3 gold units (revenues) per turn.<br>  <br>  (9) After you have added the maximum number of merchants for a city, add as many priests as possible.  Each priest adds 1 gold unit (revenue) per turn.<br>  <br>  (10) Add Great Merchant super specialists to the city with the largest revenues (i.e., the most gold per turn).  Each Great Merchant adds 6 gold per turn to the city where it is located.<br>  <br>  (11) Add Great Prophet super specialists to the city with the largest revenues (i.e., the most gold per turn).  Each Great Prophet adds 5 gold per turn to the city where it is located.<br>  <br>  (12) Add Great Artist super specialists to the city with the most revenues (i.e., the most gold per turn).  Each Great Artist adds 3 gold per turn to the city where it is located.<br>  <br>  (13) Build as many temples as possible in as many cities as possible.  Each temple that you build in a city will allow you to add one priest to that city's population.<br>  <br>  (14) Build as many cathedrals (Jewish Synagogue, Christian Cathedral, Islamic Mosque, Hindu Mandir, Buddhist Stupa, Confucian Academy, Taoist Pagoda) as possible, particularly in your largest revenue-generating cities (i.e., cities with the most gold per turn).  You can only build cathedrals in at most 25% of your cities, because you must build 4 temples in the corresponding religion before you can build a cathedral.  Each cathedral allows you to add up to 3 priests to the population of the city where it is built.<br>  <br>  (15) Build the Versailles World Wonder in a city centrally located near other cities that have high maintenance costs (i.e., lost gold per turn).  Versailles reduces maintenance costs (i.e., lost gold per turn) in the city where it is located, and also reduces maintenance (i.e., lost gold per turn) in nearby cities.<br>  <br>  (16) Build The Temple of Artemis Worldl Wonder in your city with the highest revenues (i.e., most gold per turn), which will increase revenue (i.e., gold yield) from trade routes by 100% in that city, and adds one free priest to the population of that city.<br>  <br>  (17) Build The Great Lighthouse in your largest coastal city, especially if you have many seaport cities, because it adds 2 trade routes to each coastal city, increasing revenues (i.e., gold) in coastal cities.<br>  <br>  (18) Build Angkor Wat World Wonder in your city with the highest revenues (i.e., most gold per turn), which enables you to add up to 3 priests to the population of that city.<br>  <br>  (19) If you have created one or more of the religious world wonders, build missionaries for that religion until you have spread that religion to every accessible city, including cities in other civilizations, since every city to which a religion is spread will add one gold per turn to the city that contains the corresponding religion's world wonder.<br>  <br>  (20) Later in the game, when you have researched Corporations, spread Sid's Sushi Company (by building Sid's Sushi executives and sending them on corporate missions) to as many cities as possible, including cities in other civilizations, especially if you have many coastal cities, and you have plenty of Fish, Clams, Crabs, and Rice.  Sid's Sushi Company is one of the best corporate generators of revenues (i.e., gold per turn).<br>  <br>  The above 20 suggestions are good strategies for reducing maintenance (i.e., lost gold) and increasing revenues (i.e., gold per turn), but I could add many other suggestions which might fill a manual.|`|anZxIVTDaa	Please read this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=169521" rel="nofollow">http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread...</a><br>  Im pretty sure every question or concerned is in this very thread concerning inflation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=166231" rel="nofollow">http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread...</a><br>  And this to(also its quiet the same).<br>  <br>  Here are some key statements that are in the threads.<br>  <br>  ""Inflation increases every turn.

Inflation isn't helping, but if the sudden addition of new cities on separate continents is what sent your economy into the tank, its more a problem of distance from your palace than it is inflation.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in keeping those overseas cities for yourself, you have three options.  (Reasons for keeping them include going for a domination victory, inability to give them to a friendly civ and/or create a new colony with them, or maybe they have some really useful wonders in them like the United Nations or the Pyramids.)<br>  <br>  Option 1:  Build either the forbidden palace or Versailles in one of those cites.  That will immediately drop the maintenance down to almost nothing, and you'll be back in business.<br>  <br>  Option 2: Switch your civic to State Property.  There are a few down sides to this, but the maintenance problem will go away immediately.  <br>  <br>  Option 3: Switch your civics to whatever ones generate the most gold in your home cities, do what you can to maximize gold in those cities (meaning, change your city assignments to have your people working the commerce generating tiles) while you immediately start building courthouses in every single overseas city.  Once the courthouses are up, you should be able to ease up your gold emphasis in the home cities, and then come up with a plan for what you are planning to do with those cities on the other continent.  <br>  <br>  If you are getting close to the domination victory, and can't switch to state property for some reason, then build those courthouses and keep taking enemy cities until you reach the domination limit.  If you can switch to state property, DO SO, and then keep taking enemy cities until you win.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep those cities, because they will one way or another help you win the space race, then build courthouses and one of the two wonders I mentioned above.  After that, you can go about your business as usual.  If you've already build the forbidden palace on your home continent, make a note to yourself not to do that again.  If somebody else has already build Versailles, take a look at the victory advisor screen (top cities, wonders window) and see if it happens to be in a city close to where your new overseas cities are.  If so, I would recommend sending your troops over there ASAP, and capturing it for yourself.  Hell, it was war that got you into this situtation, it can also get you out of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  On a related note, I often find that the solution to making enough gold to support new overseas cities is to have a couple super commerce cities on my home continent.  I prefer to have a couple cities with lots of cottages and all of the commerce multiplying buildings in it (Market/grocer/bank and library/university/observatory).  If I'm lucky and have a religious shrine in one of those cities, I'll also build Wall Street in that city.

Apparently The Sims 3 is EAs final chance (I guess they aren't doing too well and if this game doesn't pull them up like they are hoping it will then that will be it for them). As bad as this sounds I DON'T GIVE A S**T! The bottom line is that you promised us a solid, specific date. If you aren't a strong enough company anymore then your games can be sold to other companies that are stronger. I really don't care about EAs prosperity. You said Feb 20. I EXPECT FEB 20! Why didn't you get off your asses and advertise from the start if you anticipated this problem all along.    BS. That's all it is. I REALLY want to just not buy the game, but one sale isn't going to make a difference, so why punish myself more than they already have. Jerks.|`|glynFK9haa	I'M WITH YOU!  I WAS LITERALLY COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS AND THERE THEY GO SHOVIN' IT ALL THE WAY TO JUNE!!!!!!!|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	I AM PISSED!!! The sims 3 is delayed its coming out in june. :( First Harry Potter and the HBP now this? This is not my year.|`|oldd21fDaa	OK look if it was really being delayed don't u think the actual SIMS 3 site would have said something. In my opinion it is just a rumor because i have only seen one site with that one it. I think it will come out on its original release date, so stop worrying|`|aTU2OeOKaa	I am very annoyed, but if this delay is to repair the game, I am alright with it.    This must be better than buying the game feb 20 and it dies on you straight away.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	IM SO PISSED  i can't believe that.  June 2nd is now the date. it's on the sims3.com  i'm sooo mad.

It may not be delayed though, as it still says on the website 20th feb, but it is one of the news articles from august. But, I'm sure if it was delayed they would have taken it down.|`|S7LzXrHaaa	If it is going to be delayed, yes you will be bummed because you feel like you can't wait anymore. However, they delay it so that they can add somethings or fix some bugs, so that when the game finally does come out it will be a higher quality, and you will enjoy it more. They might be delaying it because there is some controversy about not being able to create meshes and other custom content and some people are upset about that...Hopefully they will decide to release a Sims 3 Body Shop.|`|hFZf27dlaa	Yeah, We will only find out if it will be delayed on February 3rd according to EA.     But also they said that they weren't going to release a body shop.|`|hzaOQ8CEaa	Hahah! I'm flippin mad!! I was countin down the days also! I read it was delayed for marketing purposes so that makes me even mader! It wasn't feld back to fix problems...    I waiting for home on ps3 for like a year before that finally came out cuz of delays..and that ended up sucking so i thought i'd wait to the sims three which was comin out three months later...and now this?!? and they tell us three weeks before it's supposed to go out? why not just wait till we go to the store to buy it to find out *sarcasm* haha    Also why soo far back? why can't it be like march or even arpil? Whatever the world sucks...|`|6Bvjqetqaa	[url=http://www.petitionspot.com/petitio... Sims 3 Release Date[/url] - [url=http://www.petitionspot.com/start-a...

27cd00537a4c79f450c26015e47d2f6baa	You'll have to get the original Sims 2 disc or get Sims 2 Double Deluxe in order to play the expansion packs.  I don't know where you can get it for free (I wouldn't recommend downloading it anyway, it might mess up your game).  If possible, see if you can borrow the original sims 2 from a friend -- load the disc and the expansion packs, and then you can return the original game to your friend.  That might be a better alternative than downloading it illegally or buying the first discs.

This includes all the Monarchs as well as every other monster with an effect.  There are certain exceptions though.  Exiled Force, for example, you can still activate because its effect resolves in the graveyard and not the field.  You will tribute Exiled for the cost of his effect, then his effect resolves while he is in the graveyard.  Any effect that activates on the field will be negated.|`|lS2BWfjWaa	monarch effects are negated by skill drain. best not 2 include them.   if u use skill drain, use huge beatstick monsters like goblin attack force, mechanical chaser, giant orc, etc|`|gOCpCVhLaa	Yeah the skill drain will screw you over on that effect but on another note cards like Catapult Turtle have whats called an ignition effect witch mean the effect can be activated but the damage it causes will not resolve.

I found a news story from earlier today saying the India court said the Scrabulous developers, the Agarwala brothers, can keep a web site and the game as it is, but they cannot use the name Scrabulous or any other form of the word Scrabble. So they are probably busy changing their name on the web site. Scrabulous addicts can use Wordscraper on Facebook - another game by the same developers. It's entirely customizable and you can set up the board, letter distribution and values to be the same as Scrabble. But they are still missing the blank tiles, which they promise will be coming soon. Once you get used to the different look of the board, Wordscraper is just as wonderful as our good old Scrabulous.<br>  <br>  I still do not recommend Hasbro's Scrabble on Facebook.

If you want more crazy more content and in my opinion more fun, go for Burnout.  I havent played GRID, but my friend said it was good. Also DiRT looks good aswell.

You could try the PCGS web site or look at auction sites such as eBay or Heritage Coins.     On hind sight what you may have is a civil war token.

However, there are some dedicated Eldarophiles out there who have done comparative studies of samples of Eldar language to try to make them conform to some sort of vague rules.    By and large, matters such as the names of Craftworlds are up to you, though, as the extant vocabulary is so small.  If you post on the background forums of some of the larger communities, like http://www.warseer.com or http://www.dakkadakka.com you'll probably find someone who can guide you through what little is really known; but if you want to cut straight to the chase it might help to know that Biel-Tan and Saim-Hann are both named for the pre-Roman festivals of Beltane and Samhain.  Look up some other Celtic/Saxon pagan festivals and fiddle with the word order until it looks right and you won't go far wrong!|`|ZHXKTID1aa	There is no such thing as an Eldar translator. If you ever see any craftworld name it will be tottaly made up.

cVQkkl34aa	Since the VIP passes are now sold out, you probably won't be able to find them that easy, should you happen to find them, they're gonna be ridiculously expensive. My advice to you is to just buy a 3 or 2 day pass, it's alot cheaper and when it comes down to it... your gonna get to see the same exact bands that everyone gets to see and you'll still have the chance to meet bands. The VIP ticket is really a waste of money, I think, and you'll have just as much fun if not more if you jus pick up a two-day pass. Don't miss out on Bamboozle just cause you can't get a VIP ticket!|`|aiMMmsWOaa	Try using ZebraTickets - http://www.zebratickets.com/search.php?q...    You should be able to find VIP Tix for at least one of the shows somewhere.

Sa prise en main est instinctive, son répertoire de jeu est incroyablement vaste et diversifié. La Nintendo DS a révolutionné la manière de jouer et établir de nouveau critères en matière de ludisme. Je connais beaucoup d'adultes qui profitent de la DS de leurs enfants.|`|5awBFGV8aa	Je suis accro aux consoles portables et j'ai donc acheté la DS dès sa sortie. Et revendue 1 mois après car à l'époque il n'y avait que 3 jeux dispo et j'ai perdu patiene :D<br>  <br>  J'ai donc acheté la PSP dès sa sortie, et j'y suistoujours autant accro presque 3 ans après : les jeux d'actio / aventures, de sport, de courses... sont franchement superbes<br>  <br>  Il y a quelques mois j'ai retenté le coup de la DS : ouais, c'est vrai que j'ai passé un temps fou à voir ma masse cérébrale augmenter sur "cérébral academie", c'est vrai que je faisais mon entrainement occulaire presque tous les jours, mais à part ?a.... Tous les autres jeux sont nettement inférieurs graphiquement à la PSP, et l'écran tactile est alors très peu utilisé <br>  <br>  Je dirai que si tu veux une console pour adulte pour tous les jeux et pas seulement des entrainements et tous genres, ce n'est pas la bonne console ^^|`|RrmkaKJlaa	Il peut etre très bon pour les enfants ou adultes...si vous choisissez biens les jeux pour aller avec.  Je trouve que c'est une des meilleurs consoles portative, car il y beaucoup de choix de jeux acceptable.  Bien sur, ca dépend de l'age, mais voici quelques exemples:<br>  Brain Age, Brain Age2, Sudoku, Crosswords DS, FlashFocus, Quick Yoga Training, et y'en a bien plus.

I don't think they actually distribute the demo to individual people.  <br>  <br>  Most of the people I see getting free demos before the games come out (for example, with my friend 2 weeks before GH3 came out), get hooked up by someone they know, who works at a gamer store, like GameStop.  If you know someone there they might be able to get you a demo.

DyfBde83aa	You don't need to spend a lot of money on a kit. All you need is two needles and the yarn.  They can be borrowed or your own.   It's best to learn with a light color yarn because it's easier to see the stitches.  It's also easier to follow directions online or from actually having someone teach you hands on, than from written instructions.  That way you can see how to move the yarn and needles, and you can ask questions.  Perhaps you could ask the girl who was knitting the scarf to show you.  <br>  An excellent website is www.knittinghelp.com for instructions.  They actually have little movies that show you how to do it, and you can stop it if you need to.<br>  You can get the yarn and needles at Michaels, Joann's or even Walmart.  A good yarn shop can show you, too.  Good luck and Happy Knitting|`|eAlFbYQYaa	I don't know how to knit, but I did learn how to crochet from a DVD called "I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting" with Melissa Leapman. It was fantastic.

AA11799965	u cant catch pokemon in the pyramid, but the hack version might be able to catch|`|AA12036288	I never even played Emerald. But maybe.|`|AA10097570	Not sure which one you are referring to, but here are some hints/cheats...    + Trading  When you trade when it says SAVING DONT TUN OFF POWER after the trade after it is done turn it off straight away you will both have the Pokemon it works   9 out of 10 times it will work     + Train POKEMON TO LV HUNDRED  Please rate me.. all you have to do is go to a daycare leave it there and get busy with something else like beat the elite four, train Pokemon , when it grows to Lv 50 take it to the elite four and make sure you give it an Exp share make it 70 then for my cheat mohahahahhaha THen give it the exp share while it's battling in the elite four so it can get double exp points ^_^!!! Then when it's hundred SAVE then say Few   And make your whole party hundreds     + Rare colour  Has anyone caught a rare coloured pokemon? If not look on the water around pacifficlog town and if your lucky you will find a rare coloured magicarp. My one was yellow.     + Safarizone cheat  Press a b up down right select at the same time it does work I tried!!!     + Emerald Secrets  Mirage Island Berries:   On Mirage Island, there are these berries that you can only get there. Take that one berry and plant it somewhere else, because you may not come back in a really long time.     Unlock the 3 Regis':   Place Wailord at the position of your first Pokemon, and Relicanth as your last Pokemon, then reenter the innermost chamber. "Desert Ruins", "Ancient Tomb", and "island Cave" will then finally have opennings. There will be more Braille writing. I forgot what it said though, sorry.     Get Rayquaza:   Go to the Sky Pillar that Wallace mentioned. Then reach the interior and go to the top. Rayquaza will flee to Cave of Origin (At least I think). Then when you get to Rayquaza, he'll flee again back to Sky Pillar. Enter the Sky Pillar, but just to tell you, from when he fleed, there was a huge earthquake that made so many cracks, and rocks appear. So you'll need the Mach Bike to navigate them all. Just reach the top and battle, and catch.     Double Trouble:   Be careful when two trainers are facing each other. If you go into the middle of them you might have to battle both. Try just going in front of one of them and you might be able to avoid. Some other trainers like Team Magma await you to climb a staircase, when one waits horizontally to it, and the other faces vertically to it. Those are unavoidable.     Mirage Tower:   Exploring the desert might let you be able to enter Mirage Tower. Navigate the cracks with the Mach Bike and reach the top. Use Rock Smash to break the rock and take one of the fossils. If you want the other one, go to the Fossil Maniac's house and enter the Desert Underpass. Take the fossil there, that'll be the other one that you didn't get.     + Lots of money  Interviewer Gaby & TY. They give you around 7000 with the Amulet Coin. They only go in route: 111, 118(across the water) and 120 IN THAT ORDER!     P.s: to get the AC, defeat petalburg gym leader and talk to mum     + Grow your Pokemon up to lv 100 without a gameshark or action rep  Well get a acro bike and put the two Pokemon you want growing to lv 100 in the day care then above the sandstorm theres this muddy hill you can't get up it can you.   Now this is the good part put your game boy advance on charge or put new batteries in.   Now get some object like the corner of a tv or a book to keep the up button up.   Make sure you just keep going up the mud hill and back down if you go up youve got the wrong bike.   Leave it overnight   Then you go get your Pokemon out the daycare and they should be goddamm high.   It also works for breeding to.     + Infinite safari steps of some sort  Go to the place you want to go and get on the bike that bounces. Bounce. Pokemon will attack! Have Fun! :]   P.S. You are wasting steps but thats why I said " of some sort. "   P.SS Some girl says "If I don't get any Pokemon I will wast my safari time." or something like that. She's not taking any steps!     + To get past traniers without a battle  When they look away walk I repeat walk by them,running draws there atention     + How to get shedinja  Ok go to rustboro city and catch a nincada and have only five Pokemon with you including the nicada leave one empty space in your party.it dosent have to a Pokemon ball.now raise nincada up to level 20 and it will evole to ninjask.in the empty space will be shedinja.have with your new wonder guard.i think this Pokemon will be useful at the battle fontrier.i hope I helped.     + Get a girl starter  Now, this cheat may take some time but it is definitly worth while! Now to get a girl starter keep starting your game over until you get a girl starter! It may take about ten or more tries but keep doing it and you will get a girl starter!     + Fishing rods  To get the old rod, go to dewford town and talk to the fisherman near the gym. He will give you a old rod. To get good rod, talk to the fisherman on route 118, east of mauville city. You must need surf to reach him. Talk to him and you will get good rod.   To get super rod, go to mossdeep city and go north of the space center and go into the house. The man inside will give you super rod.     + Ez Way To Get POKEMON!!!  Ok I found a REALLY good way to get the pokemon.Ok when you find the Pokemon that you wun't throw the pokeball (it works with all the balls to but back to the point)when the ball get to the Pokemon it will bouns 4 time so press down 4 time along with it and then it will go right,left,right go along like right left right at the same time.It Really works.(works like 90% of the time but it's worth it.)     + Easy pokerus  Just put in catch trainers Pokemon and have 1 space in your team

ickyq53aaa	Right now I am playing The Secret of Evermore on a SNES emulator that I have on my NDS.  I have been buying games, but only used ones.  I just bought Super Mario Galaxy for 24 bucks on ebay.  I love old-school games, the nostalgia really gets me.  I don't care so much about how realistic or fantastic a game is, game playability is what it is about.  A game has to have either a really good story, or some good comedy if they want me to follow the story.|`|OwMcAay7aa	1. well i play both.    2. it depends on what the player likes best. i like both realistic and non-realistic games.    for the guy above me:    thats an april fools joke.|`|yVWKiTwTaa	well this is really just a matter of opinion, as everyone will like something different. nostalgia games, i just finished zelda the wind waker a few weeks ago. and im with you on fantastic graphics but in a fantasy world. have you seen there is going to be a movie for the ocarina of time? you can watch the trailer for it at myspace, search for 'hero of time'    i hate to say it because im a long time zelda fan but it looks awful.
pdEEIDQdaa	Why you would ask this in the Video and Online games section is beyond me.    But if I were you I would just go and buy the books. All four of them. The movie left parts out and changed things up. Typical of movies to do this when they're based off of books. The books are far more descriptive and interesting. In the future movies, even more might get changed or replaced, so to get the most from the story it's always best to start from the source material. Watch the movies afterwards.    It'll take a few years for all of the movies to come out anyway. Do you really want to wait that long to know how it all ends? :p|`|0Z7sxpbcaa	the movie was horrrible  yes read all the books    twilight,newmoon,eclipse,breaking dawn      the kristen stewert did a horrible job as bella.   the movie is so not accurate  i was dissapointed
SGoR53YJaa	i think its the same as long as you didn't hack the game.  and yes you have beat the game if you defeat the final bowser.  you should get all the stars and shoot yourself to the top of the castle and reunite with yoshi.
4uYAkBtEaa	Hm .. you must be talking Sephiroth? The guy from FF7 ? haha  Yes, I know he's extremely hard. A few years ago, me and my friend both tried beating him. We came SO CLOSE he was on his green bar but we eventually died.  I gave up after that D:  I know my friend's brother beat it without any tricks, so it's possible.  Just keep trying : )
2Qr8vcAfaa	Like tha_family said, lootshare is an okay way to make money with high level friends. You'll need around 2 level 80's to help you with the cockroaches though. If you've got friends that will help, go for it - otherwise avoid high level monsters.    Since you're a "low level" non-member, there are only two monsters you'll be able to kill that give you a decent drop to XP ratio. These are hill giants and moss giants. They're busy on F2P (and on P2P) but they are the best balance.     Best of luck training, and don't give up just 'cause it gets busy. Try not to get too annoyed either. ;)|`|DujXZCd9aa	Lesser Demons. I trained on Green Dragons if you were member.|`|lhuJ5K5caa	For non members moss giants are the best if you've completed the dragon slayer quest as they're located on crandor island. If you havent done the dragon slayer quest then kill lesser demons. Go onto rune tips and click on bestiary to get a full list of monsters avaible to attack on runescape|`|58jHO9tsaa	I would suggest killing either hill giants (level 28) or   moss giants (level 42) they do not have the best drops but they drop "Big Bones" 100% which is a great way of making money in non members world|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	I'd go to roaches or mossies, killing things on f2p is not a huge source of income. Nonetheless if your determined to make money this way (as opposed to say wcing or mining) roaches drop rune skimmys and noted ores (mith and addy) and mossies only profitable drop are big bones which if you have enough time to get 25 tele walk back get 25 tele walk back etc. is a decent choice for your level.|`|DP3WRLIaaa	U choose:    Lesser demons:   - Money, Gold ore, Uncut gems, Jug of wine  - Steel scimmy, axe, longsword   - Steel full helm, Mithril chainbody, Mithril sq shield, Rune med helm, Black kiteshield and Iron kiteshield   - Fire, Chaos, Death    Moss G:  - Money, B bones, Steel bar, Spinach roll, Coal, Uncut gems  - Magic staff, Mith sword  - Black sq shield, Steel med helm, Steel kiteshield  - Air, Earth, Chaos, Nature, Law, Cosmic  - Iron/ Steel arrows|`|dYYDXKGkaa	are you a member and if you are lootshare at roaches near edgville with some higher lvl friends or something in that nature|`|DqI6vI6Qaa	Besides goin to Clan Wars or Castle Wars... I'd hafta say lesser demons or moss giants|`|WJX00yYKaa	If ur that high become a member its only like 10$ because theres really nothing to kill if u that high and a non member.|`|BRA5df2waa	-moss giants in crandor  -cockroach workers in stronghold of safety  -bounty hunter in wilderness  -white knights in falador  -black knights north of dwarven city  -hill giants in varrock
2Qr8vcAfaa	Like you've already been doing, making steel bars is a great way to make money when you have lower stats. If you're going to become a member soon, then I would suggest making cannonballs; more smithing XP, and more money.    Mining is an "okay" way to make money - it's not as fast or as easy as Smithing, but it can be done. Since your Mining level is 53, iron is your best chance to make money. You'll get it fast, and have a higher Mining level than others. Don't get coal, since most people have 70+ when doing this, so you'll find it harder to make money.    Since I'm not aware of your other stats, I'll just say that cutting yews is a great way to make money for members and non-members alike. I say that 70+ is needed, since this is when they get faster. If you want to do this, then cut willows up to this point (just don't expect to make any money from willows).     One method that's not as great for non-members is fishing. Sure, you can fish lobsters (they get fast enough around 50) but the bank trip it long, so I don't usually advise this. You could go for trout and salmon. They won't sell for much, and might take a while to sell, but it's easier than others.|`|IhUYV9xwaa	Steel bars are your best bet for profit with your stats. If you don't feel like mining all the iron ore and coal, you can buy them off of the G.E. When you buy one iron and two coal, you make about 100gp per bar. When you buy one iron and one coal (which is illogical but still...) you turn a profit of around 300gp. When you buy the two coal and mine the one iron yourself (my method, helps raise mining and smithing levels while still turning a good profit), you make about 200gp per bar. That adds up to 200k for every thousand bars, which should take you a few hours at the max to mine and smelt.|`|dFRgSbTaaa	ummmmm kill zombies at the stronghold of security take the herbs that them and the flesh crawlers drop you will get 20k-50k per load|`|8nOjM549aa	Sell your body as a prostitute.|`|QvtspYqsaa	check this website out http://runescapebestonlinegame.info/    they have ads and it helps out alot!|`|G7YBTbN7aa	Fastest and easiest is through grand exchange from my experience.  Just use this guide: http://rsparty.up.to/  I'd recommend it, i made over 18m in my first week using it|`|dm3Aiu46aa	mining is a good way to make money but you can also kill hill giants and sell there big bones...... you wouldn't believe how much they can go for. also they drop roots and those can be sold for a lot of money too.|`|AA10116317	Mining the rune essence and selling them in bulk at the bank.  It is easy because the bank is near the mining place where you talk to that wizard dude and he telle's you to the ores.|`|UUjH1qHhaa	Start not playing runescape. -.-|`|XoiQJWo1aa	If you go buy some runes and enchant them so they are full attack power aim them at yourself and die,  Quit runescape fag,

b6f230f54f67b22cbe07843096af3e2aaa	Hey, I love DDR Max, it's the first dance dance revolution game released on the PS2.  Dance Dance rebolution is a terrific series.  Although I prefer some of the later games in the series, there are some solid tracks on this one and you will definitely get a lot out of it.  I prefer SuperNOVA or Extreme 2.    There are no real hip hop tracks, per se, but here are some R&B or pop tunes you might enjoy exploring:    Kind Lady  I Like to Move It  Baby Baby Give me Your Love  Jam & Marmalade  Stomp to my Beat|`|5ad9dc4222beee4d16027d09f956bf12aa	Well, DDR MAX is the sixth mix in the series, excluding Club Verisons and Solo Editions.    Heard of the Stone Bros.? Maybe not. The Stone Bros. is actually Naoki Maeda, DDR's famous artist. Their song on this game is Let the Beat Hit 'Em. There are two other versions: the BMDXII Mix and the Classic R&B Style. It classifies as R&B and another, Super Star is some Rap with a bit of techno beats.    Now, here's how gameplay works: Just hit the arrows into the stepzone.    Now, on your final stage, if you recieve a AA or AAA as a grade on a song on Heavy (Maniac or SSR), you will be prompted to play an Extra Stage. The Extra stage is the song MAX 300, the first of the famous MAX series. You will play this on Maniac, 1.5x scroll, reverse, and a no recover bar. Any percentage of the life bar lost cannot be recovered.    Succed in MAX 300 and you will be prompted to play a second Extra Stage, called the Encore Extra Stage. This is Candy*, on 3x scroll, reverse, Sudden death, Maniac.    Any bad judgement on this and you will fail.    Well, I hope you have fun. Good luck with MAX, and MAX 300.|`|10d0543a19e890c62968d2a5ebd1ede4aa	I like     Extreme 2 better     AND I LOVE SUPERNOVA THAT GAME IS AWSOME       but MAX is also a awsome game.    just that supernova sounds better     |`|95d3f5a4d66b0f103be6c88c45b9c98aaa	There are all kinds of songs on the CD.

If:  Shooting and intense (very bloody) also multiplayer --->Gears of War 2  Tricks and competition --->Skate 2  courageous and intense (very bloody) --->Left for Dead    My opinion is   Gears of war 2 since it has great multiplayer games also there are hidden collectibles throughout the single player campaign.    However it's your choice so you can try new types of game play :)|`|mYcphPdtaa	Gears of war 2 = I love it to bits. Awesome game, now that they have had an update it is even better. Hard to get to grips with, but very gory and a very good FPS, story mode is awesome    Skate 2 = played demo, is ok just very difficult, you cannot just pick it up and play like the Tony Hawk games    Left 4 Dead = If you like zombie games get Dead Rising. This was ok, just not my forte so to speak. Ive heard mixed reviews from friends about this|`|NW8upSg5aa	If you haven't played gears 1 get that before you get the sequel. if you already played the first gears then then the second one is the best choice for you.    Left for dead is awesome if you're a 1st person shooter fan, and specially if you like valve's stuff. on versus mode you get to play as a zombie, and that's my favorite part.    Skate 2 doesn't really require you to have played the first one. it's an awesome game. it looks beautiful. and the tricks are very easy to pull off, unless you're a tony hawk fanboy, in which case they are apparently impossible.

rnVdxXotaa	It could be a let down since it looks like its the exact same as resident evil 4 except it has coop. But resident evil 4 was a great game but resident evil 5 doesn't look like its added anything better other than better graphics.

I would give you the exact name, but the game's at my cousin's house :( Sorry about that...    Remember, though, that you have to be in the Titan Age to build the Tower. So you must be advanced to that age.  If you are, then find your town center and find the Tower button, then choose where you want to place it, and start building!    After it's built (which will probably take some time, so get A LOT of laborers, workers, etc working on it), then on the screen, will be a small portrait of your titan. Choose it, and he/she will appear at your Tower within a certain amount of time.You can then let the titan go wherever you please, crushing other teams, conquering stuff, anything.    Note: the Tower may not be at the town center, but I have a very strong feeling that it is. If it isn't, you might have to keep looking. The only thing is that you HAVE to be in the Titans Age to get the Tower.    LOVE THAT GAME!    And hope I helped,  ?Peace.Earth.Love?

If you are on the PS3, if you change your tag to the following,these text affects will appear.

Or, if you are wanting it to be part of your pattern with the thread, try this.  Use a complimentary color that will stick out from your other colors.  Put it in with your thread and leave it as a base thread.  The color will not show until you want it to.  Then, wrap your letter color in the same pattern around your other thread. Make sure to hide it according to the letter.

xyOcnQjpaa	take it to apple store and have it replaced if still under warranty. Anyhow, you shouldn't have turned it on yet until absolutely certain that it is dry... You might have damaged some of the circuits on the board... What normally works when you spill water or get a electronic wet or moist is put it in a bowl of rice and cover it, and leave it over night.

YcMQfNBCaa	BAsically fighting does not always guarantee that you turn evil. If you fight evil characters, then you gain good points, which turns you good. In order to get evil points, you must kill random characters and do evil deeds.    As for the question on battle system, it uses a series of "rolls" of a computer dice to generate the chance to hit or miss, to block or get hit, and many other things. IN order to defeat your enemies your skills need to be high, and you need to have luck. Lol

96e7a04207fc1f35f5e43db7ecffc86eaa	To be honest I don't actually know, and i can't imagine $ony freely distributing information like that.    My best advise is (throw your playstation in the bin. I HATE $ony, they ripped me 200 on a mini-disc player that broke within 3 month) use Acronis DiskDirector V.10.    It can format partions 'on-the-fly' can do anything(within reason) to a HDD and has about 100 types of file systems that are unlabled, so i guess it would be one of those. If you can get hold of a PS2 HDD and plug it into your pc, and use Acronis to identify it, make a note of the type, and use that.    Being $ony (they are REALLY awkard, I hate micro$oft too, but the x-box really is a better console) it possibly needs a certain set of files upon it, or the PS2 will reject it anyhay(I don't know this to be fact, but i have played with $ony file systems and copyright/protection routines before and it wasn't fun!)     Besides PS3 out soon anyhow(i'd avoid that too. Damn $ony to the ends of the earth. and back again.)|`|813e3e1e08ccea80a1ce496bd81fbe6baa	You don't, because you can't.

Empieza introduciendo primero un dedo (entra y sale, entra y sale...); luego trata de meter dos dedos. Ello facilita mucho la dilatacin. Te dira que sin necesidad de meter el tercer dedo ya puedes penetrar.   Mientras le introduces los dedos con la otra mano trata de incetivar el placer en su zona vaginal, pues ello favorecer tambin a su dilatacin anal. Debes ser cari?oso, all ella se sentir segura, pues para muchas mujeres la penetracin anal es un pecado.|`|79dbe21336d124d406fee00e586e6cb8aa	ponele bastante gel o crema y mandale fruta hermano|`|93acb95ec46e2464490f442db4418739aa	tienes que hacerlo con mucha paciencia, y  ella tiene que estar bien excitadita, yo comensaria masajeando su orificio con los dedos, con mucha suavidad, una buena lubricacin, luego introduciendo de a poco tal vez no lo logres de primera, pero tenle paciencia, dale tiempo, si es realmente tu novia y la quieres.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Ok, Victor.       Antes que nada, ella tiene que estar completa y absolutamente de acuerdo, tal vez ella lo esta intentando nada mas por darte gusto, platiquenlo muy bien y checa que si este de acuerdo.      Si esta bien de acuerdo lo que te sugiero es lo siguiente:       Ella debe de estar bastante bien estimulada (excitada), esto lo haces con todos los juegos previos para poder lograrlo, comienza con una penetracion vaginal normal y durante este lapso puedes comenzar a estimular su ano con los dedos, sin penetrarla, unicamente en los alrrededores y en la entrada del mismo.   Despues, dependiendo de que tan dispuesta se encuentre puedes iniciar introduciendo uno de tus dedos al tiempo que continuas con la penetracion vaginal, debes de checar las reacciones que ella tenga para saber si continuas o no.      Este es un proceso que lleva su tiempo, recuerda que el ano es un orificio que no esta hecho para esto, ademas de que por desgracia nuestra cultura latina nos hace pensar que el sexo anal es unicamente para relaciones homosexuales entre hombres, por ello es que las damas se ven en cierta incertidumbre, te reitero, platiquenlo.     Ahora bien, si ella ya se siente lista para una penetracion anal con tu pene, deben de hacerlo con una lubricacion perfecta, te recomiendo que utilices lubricantes a base de agua que los puedes conseguir en farmacias o sex shops. comienza poco a poco, con ternura y con mucho tacto. Debes de respetar en todo momento el que ella diga "no" y no insistas, de lo contrario corren ell riesgo de que no quiera volver a intentarlo nuevamente.     El consejo principal es la higiene, despues de que utilices tus dedos o pene en el area del ano, de NINGUNA MANERA debes de introducirlos en la vagina sin antes lavarte perfectamente, de lo contrario corren el riesgo de que ella contraiga una infeccion bastante delicada.     El otro consejo que te doy es RESPETO, si ella ves que no quiere o no puede por cualquier razon, no insistas, corres el riesgo de que te mande al diablo y despues no podras ni por un lado ni por otro.    Mucho exito y suerte, saludos...!|`|7999673286b420e8db2052f8fbe8149caa	ponerle crema o gel. si es muy peque?o tienes que trabajar de a poco, con un dedo despus dos.|`|820bfb5e5b2bd44b2fcf0bde3c253c89aa	Primero que nada tenele paciencia y no la apures,y si ella realmente queire tener sexo anal contigo se va a relajar y no va a estar tan tensionada, yo creo que esta tension le hace que le duela, a por supuesto tenes que lubricarla bien. suerte|`|f272399fdeb762469f372322c8504b4faa	No la inicies...  Deja que ella te inicie a ti.    El esfnter anal tiene terminales nerviosas que por afinidad y cercana al canal vaginal despierta sensaciones nicas en las algunas mujeres.    El ano para poder ser penetrado sin dolor ni desgarros debe estar ben relajado, consiguete bastante lubricante ntimo ipoalergnico (no uses vaselina o glicerina -los resultados finales sern sucios y temibles-) deja que ella misma se lubrique no escatimes en cantidad (deja que ella misma descubra su cuerpo con sus caricias)    Si gusta del sexo oral (y te esmeras en ello...) puedes al tiempo que la haces gozar excitar su ano con tu dedo ndice (bien lubricado) si ella se "cierra" no la fuerzes sigue en lo tuyo...    Tarde o temprano estar tan excitada y su ano tan relajado y receptivo que empezara a buscarte, dejale que ella elija la posicin que quiera y marque el ritmo (no le apuris) sed paciente tened en cuenta que cuanto mas agradable la experiencia para ella tanto mas le gustara repetirla luego.    Unos consejillos de ultimas:    Una vez que eyacules no abandonis la cama en busca de una toalla para limpiaros (si es que la necesitis), tened la precaucin de tener la toalla a mano antes de empezar, pues nada hay mas que le moleste a una mujer que el hombre se levante a limpiarse mientras ella le queda mirando como el to se va a lavar el adminiculo...    NO le hagas el comentario tipico, Tia te a quedado el culo de la ostia... menudo agujero te he dejado...    No hagas alarde de tu logro, endulzale los oidos con lo que desea escuchar, sigue sus se?ales.    No lo comentes con tus amigos.

Woodcutting, mining, and fishing are the main money makers. But you can always find other outside the box ways of making money. It takes time.|`|32d480916cc4b91b7d982ba35e734fe7aa	Go to the general store and buy 50k worth of lobbies (lobsters).  You can sell them for 250 - 300k each.

The easiest thing with the diner dash games is to treat every level like they have "sittings."  Try and wait for the line to fill up before seating people.  For example, if you have four tables, wait until four groups of people are in line.  Then, seat the four people, and that way you can make good chains.  Try and seat similar people, such as all people who can tolerate noise, all people that eat slow, etc.  Also, the best way to make loads of money is the seating.  You can rack up serious points fast if you just concentrate on seating people with the same color as the chairs.    Thus, the key to winning the game is:    Planning on how to seat people.  Chaning bonuses.    Yay!  Any further questions, please ask me.
AA10704364	Well, this is a game I learned in California.  It's good for all ages.    Prepare 3 inch x 3 inch pieces of paper.  - many more than you need.  In advance, on each paper write the name of a celebrity that the kids would recognize:  singers, actors, dancers, sports figures, etc.  Don't forget cartoon characters too.    Scotch tape one name on the back of each person.    Here is the game:    Each kid has to guess what the name on their back is by asking questions.  The answers can only be 'yes' or 'no'.  Nothing else.    The game can either be played one on one, or have the whole group in a circle and one person in the middle asking the questions.    This is a fun game and it's very interesting to see how people think & formulate questions.    If they guess the answer they can get another name to do it again.  It's a great ice-breaker when done one-on-one.    You can have prizes or not.   (We do not give prizes.  )    Enjoy.
b6f230f54f67b22cbe07843096af3e2aaa	I have the same problem with my family, and I'm a professional (dunno how old you are, but it seems like you're independant).  It's hard to explain to people from a different generation, or even to some in this generation, that video games or "electronic entertainment" is becoming more of a form of media or story-telling device than simply something to kill time like Pac Man.    I think it would be best if you just left the Wii at home.  I might be a source of tension over your visit that might ruin the holiday for you and your family.  On the other hand, I think it would be mature if you defended your positiona nd let them know how you feel about your hobby.  We're all entitled to a hobby and entertainment.  Just don't let it slip to your aunt that you are low on funds!    I think it would work well if you brought it, and let them experience it for themselves.  Although, some people are totally unwilling to try it out, as it is still considered immature to play video games.|`|5eae77bab188e568b1654094b7868146aa	just bring it..its christmas..    or if you are getting more presents over there then dont bring it .|`|9b01e8d45d452aa5ce362ea245d4b873aa	Since you'll be in your Dad's home you should live by his rules and leave the toys at your home.  And since you already mentioned being low on funds to your Aunt, you'll lose all creditability with her if she sees what you did spend your money on.      Try and remember what Christmas is all about the birth of Christ not Santa.  The Christmas tree is symbolic of the Cross Jesus was crucified on.      If you just enjoy your family's company in a non electronic way, you'll have many more fond memories of your visit than is you fight with them.      Of course you may want to start being honest with them and let them know that you're interested in Wii and games and that you hope to be able to bring that next time you visit.|`|63e7b3f2a9a6435c2b9ebb64f6095e51aa	i'd keep it to myself and when i get back to my "home" then i'd play it like carzy and not run the risk of getting yelled at|`|cac77bd179afba2d620bf5a12d789cd9aa	honestly i would bring it and show it too them.  when they see what it can do they will be amazed.|`|f0ca9b53366d81ca65d7959bedb9fcf9aa	If you were low on funds this month how did you afford a Wii?  If you really think that it's going to cause problems I would just leave it.  Also, if you are an adult why would you have to justify where and how you spend your money to anyone?
b6f230f54f67b22cbe07843096af3e2aaa	Civ IV is a pretty good game.  The recommended settings are for optimal performance, so it would run slow on your machine -- possibly too slow to even make it playable.   There are ways to tune down the graphics settings in the game options, but that might not be an enjoyable experience for you.    I think if you were still interested in the civ experience, you could find an old copy of Civilization II, to game that revolutionized the genre.  There are still lots of copies around, and that would be best.  Civ 3 was kind of eh...

vtJDHJDYaa	Approach Sephiroth to begin a pretty awesome cutscene. Afterwards, you'll receive the FENRIR. This keyblade is pretty powerful in conjunction with a Negative Combo ability--every attack will be a finishing blow! Pretty nifty, and it has good range and looks cool.     You can now try completing the Paradox Cups in the Coliseum or continue your journey in The World that Never Was. If you choose the Paradox Cups, The game's final (and possibly hardest) challenges await you now. The Paradox Cups are essentially the same battles you've fought in the previous cups (with one exception), but the enemies are much harder. The Pain and Panic Paradox Cup should be open at this point. To open the Cerberus Paradox Cup, you need to reach level 5 with Valor, Wisdom, and Master forms. To open the Titan Paradox Cup, you need to reach level 5 with all your summons. To open the last Cup (which is different than the Goddess of Fate Cup), you'll need to reach level 7 with Valor, Wisdom, Master, and Final Forms, as well as your summons. The final Cup is the Hades Cup, and it's brutal. It's 50 rounds long, and the rounds get exceedingly difficult, especially towards the end. Talk to Hades in his chamber to access any of these Cups once they're unlocked.|`|tW8sPpDFaa	I don't understand what you're saying. If you could provide more information I would answer it.

Try going to cosplay.com forums~ You'll probably find what material is usually used for the Lulu cosplay there. :]
mYcphPdtaa	The newest one (i cannot remember the name) has dolby audio, so therefore is the better one. However it is very expensive. The different between the x1 & x3 is wires. That is all.    I have the wired headset and it is awesome. On my games i no longer look for people, i listen for them. So stick with the ones you got as they are a very good piece of kit!

Makes things easier. When the game comes out, you go to the same store you ordered it from and pick it up. Also, you have to pay FULL PRICE of the game subtracting what you downed when you preorder. Normally the down payment is $10. So when you go pick up the game, assuming it's $49.99 plus the tax making it about $54 if you are in california, you would be paying about $44 when the game releases.|`|dYYDXKGkaa	yes that is full price because preording is just like reserving a copy of it and you just go to the store when the call your or email you yea u just go to the store and pick it up

mGKQY6OPaa	if ur alliance... do dwarf  if ur horde... do orc..  i would say go horde for orc cuz they r the best hunters|`|XSiuRFRVaa	tanaris, or skywall works its a super awsome realm... and i would make an orc or a dranie sorry i dont no how to spell it... but yuppe thats about it     hope i helped....... :D|`|RI1brp91aa	An Alliance night elf    OR     a horde blood elf    Realms:    boulderfist (pvp)  cairne (rp)  tichondrius (pvp) |`|AA10745085	Usually the Night Elf is a good race...because of thier shadow meld racial ability.

Also at level 18 if you have warsong gulch points you can get this really good bow.      Hope this helped.|`|w9Nu1URYaa	Try night elves because they have a racial passive of being fast and dodgefull, and that's what you need as a hunter!!  and you have more control over the skills because you can see them better!      and the realm, i would suggest a private server:  just change your Realmlist.wtf that is located in your Data>en** folder   into the server you like to play.  i like to play on Wowbeez.com    just sign in and change realmlist into : set realmlist wowbeez.com    that's it, and you can play for free!!!    And BTW ive got a night elf rogue lvl 80!|`|QRTN3Ee9aa	If your going to join a Europe server, I highly recommend that you join Eonor. These are some reason's why: Best battlegroup misery,Guilds are Friendly but always active, its easy to make money at lower levels and higher. Easy to get a group for raids, dungeons or even quests. Alot of raids on opposite factions.     Also if you're a Orc Hunter you will have a bonus crit rating with your skinning rating aswell. And people would rather invite a Orc to a party than a Tauren or blood elf.
KXiwLOtOaa	I think it is much to violent and scary ....they should put in a feature where you can convert the creatures to the good side instead of killing them
l27zURMnaa	I believe as long as you own the original it is not illegal. however to illustrate the point that they wont do anything. I DOWNLOAD COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL ARREST ME NOW.  pretty much if someone created an emu for a 360 or ps3 they would do something about it, however because the n64 psx nes sega etc aren't bringing in the cash they don't care. project 64 is imo the best I use emuparadise for roms they have a pretty good selection  dont worry man your fine

2OPaqkLcaa	Sounds like you need to install the video drivers for your specific video chipset.    If you are not sure what sort of video chipset you have...    Click start, click run, type dxdiag and hit enter.    Switch to the the display tab.    Under device it will tell you what type of chipset you have.    -----    When you reformat a computer the normal steps after you install the OS are to install the Motherboard drivers, Install the latest version of direct3d, then install the latest version of the video drivers for your specific video chipset.    If you reformat and reinstall windows, it will install some generic motherboard and video drivers just to get the ball rolling.    The motherboard drivers might have been included with a disk that came with the computer. It is not necessary to install them, but recommended. If they are not installed some elements of the system might not perform as well as they could, or you might have problems with some of the hardware being recognized correctly.    Anyhow, at this point I would go the following site and follow the steps that will ensure you have the latest version of directX installed.    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113    After that you need to download and install the latest video drivers. These are the files that actually control the video chipset. DirectX will use these files to communicate with the video chipset. Video drivers are specific to a series of chipsets, so you need to know what the chipset is, Most likely it will be either an Intel, ATI, or Nvidia chipset. Once you know what chipset it is you can go to the manufactureres website locate the latest version of the drivers, DL, and install them.|`|XSiuRFRVaa	i no watu mean about being crazy about it haha i love it, maybe you arnt putting the right disk in because, i lost my sims pets and it will only work if u have the right disk mabye thats it :P    hope i helped :D

PBLP6ndSaa	its ok. its not that hard to get on a mac but there are steps.    first of all download crossover games - use a torrent coz its free and all works well as far as i can tell.    then do a torrent search (i dont think it really matters which site you use but i used thepiratebay). search for "counter strike: source for your mac" and download it. it takes f'n ages (like 3 days or something) but it worked great for me once it was done.    once it is finished i think you open it with crossover games which is quite easy and then it does a windows install wizard and its all easy as pie. just dont move the files around in the folders once your done.|`|pOMd7c8Xaa	I would just install xp on it.

2Qr8vcAfaa	When you're a member, you get the ability to raise the following skills; Agility, Herblore, Thieving, Fletching, Slayer, Farming, Construction, Hunter and Summoning. As well as this, you get to access new areas of the map and extra methods of training existing skills, and even more quests to do.    For an in-depth guide of these skills, it's best to go on www.tip.it (it's a site I use and I've found it very helpful). You'll be able to look at ways to train these skills, the best methods of training, and also the benefits they bring. On the site you'll also find a quest guide, which will give you a walk through of the new members quests (as well as non-member ones).    I would say that RuneScape membership is only worth it if you know what you're doing. For new people, it's best to stick with non-members, as you aren't able to fully appreciate the benefits that being a member brings.     If you know what you're doing on the game, and know the things you need to do in the month (this isn't a necessity, but it helps make membership worth it) then I would say go for it. If you're still relatively new to the game and aren't that much of an experienced player, I would avoid membership and save your money.
NJvEycP1aa	There is no way anybody will give you their registration key without some means of payment. Spore can only play online, so there isn't any difference if you say you will play offline. That's not how it works. You say you bought it from the Salvation Army, which definitely isn't true, seeing as the Salvation Army help out the poor, and your saying you have a computer. FYI poor people don't have computers. Also, the Salvation Army wouldn't be selling video games, let alone Spore. If you really did buy it from the "Salvation Army" a.k.a. Limewire then ask them for a code, don't go on Yahoo! answers

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.    The campaign map on Empire: Total War is re-created from real satellite images for accurate and realistic gameplay. The map features North, Central and South America, in conjunction with the Caribbean Islands. The Middle-East, North Africa, Europe, Russia and parts of Asia are also included.    Empire: Total War was scheduled for release on February the 6th, but unfortunately they delayed it to March the 3rd.
AE3lv4pRaa	Hi,    To become a rockstar,i can tell you some steps:-         1. Learn how to play an instrument or take vocal lessons.       2. Practice, practice, and practice and keep believing in yourself. If you lose hope in your talents, you'll never make it anywhere. Sometimes you think you lost your talent, but you should just take a rest and come back later to try again.       3. Form a band, or you can work solo.       4. Write your music.       5. Record some of your music, after you've memorized the lyrics/notes by heart. It's a good idea to make a CD with your tracks.       6. Allow your closest friends to listen and consider your music       7. Let a group of people listen to your music after you've made changes; watch their expressions. If there's a lot of concerned faces and shaking of heads, tweak a little more of your tunes.       8. Play at gigs. Sometimes they're hard to get but you need them for exposure.       9. Create a band/artist MySpace to reach more people and help create a larger fan base.      10. Hand out CDs of your music to people you know/meet or even to strangers, this might help you get more fans and/or get a record deal.      11. Record your band's music on a video and upload it on Youtube. Make sure the video is "cool" and will appeal to many people.      12. Tell your friends to recommend your music to as many people as possible; the effect will snowball, and you may have an even larger fan base.      13. Try to get a recording company to sign your band, but make sure it's after you have played at venues and have an acceptable number of fans.    I hope that these tips will be usefull to move farword!    thank you!|`|9ocKwWvFaa	Songs sound so cool!

Since you're a member and a "low level" I would suggest Rock Crabs. Sure, they're boring and don't give good drops... They're great XP though. :) I wouldn't suggest AFK training, no matter who tells you to do it.     Alternatively, you could try flesh crawlers in the second level of the security stronghold.

You earn credits (money) by playing free virtual games with other players. You can spend that money on rooms, clothing, and furniture.  You also do quests, when you follow tasks and win a prize. It's pretty fun. Even more fun when you have friends on there to hang out with.:) And it's free!
