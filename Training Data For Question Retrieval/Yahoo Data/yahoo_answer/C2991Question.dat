20090225152343AA6cJ0w	Environment;Global Warming	Is global warming a myth or a reality?	I hear so many differing opinions on this, it is very confusing.      On the one hand, I understand people's frustration with this issue being used as a political tool...but let's face it, everything gets politicized nowadays.      On the other hand, is rejecting this based on politicization smart? After all, if we move forward with heads stuck in sand, doesn't that just harm us in the end? While actually doing something about global warming only serves to help everyone in the end? Or is this merely a tactic to create a new industry for profit?      Let me know people! If you have links, that would be great too.      Educate me!

20090225153831AAiqskx	Environment;Other - Environment	How many endangered animals do you think I could jump over in a jeep?	In order to raise money for some animal charities, my friend has devised the following fundraising charity event;      A number of endangered species are captured and taken to a disused airfield. They are then secured (humanely!) and spread generously along a runway, just in front of a large wooden ramp. In our trusty jeep, we will speed along the runway, up the ramp and attempt to hurdle as many of the endangered species as possible.      People give money to charity based on our courageous and well thought out stunt.      What do you think? How many species do you think we should go with? My friend suggests around 40, but I'm thinking that's somewhat ambitious - we're trying to save animals here, rofl!
