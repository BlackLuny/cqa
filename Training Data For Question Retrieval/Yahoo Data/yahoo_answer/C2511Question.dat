20090225151801AAQrYwd	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hey! Twilight fans and Twilight haters! Read this and what do you notice?	Here I go, comparing three suspiciously similar characters from three very well-known books. First up, Edward Cullen from Twilight.      Edward Cullen- Twilight   Appearance: Described as having amazingly good looks    Temperament: Very kind and thoughtful.   Love interest(s): Bella, who he later "kills" by turning into a vampire, and is mortal.   Life condition: Immortal, never-changing   Popularity: Non-existent. Considered a freak.   Age: 17, really 110 (about)   Family: All immortal   Misc: Takes girlfriend to secret place in woods for first day together.      Jesse Tuck- Tuck Everlasting   Appearance: Described as having amazingly good looks    Temperament: Very kind and thoughtful.   Love interest(s): Winnie, who is mortal.    Life condition: Immortal, never-changing   Popularity: Lives in forest. Would have been popular, most likely.   Age: 17, really 109    Family: All immortal   Misc: Takes girlfriend to secret place in woods for first day together.      Dorian Gray- The Picture of Dorian Gray   Appearance: Described as having amazingly good looks    Temperament: Very kind and thoughtful at first, then very cruel.   Love interest(s): (can't remember name), who he later kills indirectly because he breaks her heart, and she is normal mortal.   Life condition: Immortal, never-changing   Popularity: EXTREMELY popular among upper-class English society.   Age: Doesn't say, about 17 or 18 at start of novel.   Family: None in book.   Misc: Is very vain, essentailly sells his soul so he can have good looks forever.      Odd similarities, am I right?      I personally think that The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best books ever written, Twilight is very good, and Tuck Everlasting is okay.         I always look for similarities between books. Don't get me started on "Harry Potter" and "Charlie Bone".      I was going to add Cedric Diggory from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to this list, but decided that there weren't that many similarities after all.
20090225152115AAQjXYF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The book thief by markus zusak.?	yeah. well i had to read a historical fiction book for school. it was a real good book. cried like a baby at the end. few questions. after papa nn mama nn everybody died, did liesel live with ilsa hermann? and if not, where would she prolly been. and what did you think of the boook?
20090225152735AAVCcZ1	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Whats wrong with my essay?	New stack attack. That’s what they called it. It was true in a sense. It does attack in steps which will stack up until all the fat builds up to block the heart. It will be a slow and planned attack but it will come. No-one is to be blamed but the attacked.      What is my obsession with the new stack attack?       First, I am stifled in this boredom so much that the phrase “ I am bored” sounds oppressing. I itch at places. My surroundings seem to be wavering. Claustrophobia is what I feel. I am wondering, if I’ll be able to take this much longer. I am staring at this piece of paper and i am not thinking.  Instead, I am just following the wagon. I am not on it. I am trailing behind just to get a glimpse of a world that I may never enter. It looks like a godly place but then comes a boulder. The wagon stumbles and I stop. Why should I follow the wagon?       It was nothing special. The question haunts me and proves my sheer stupidity.      Second, I have a problem. A very big problem. I can’t seem to grasp it. It stands so close to me that I can’t identify it. My eyes blur from trying. I shift and turn but that doesn’t help. I ask people who I assume care for me. But they say nothing or they lie. They talk without knowing anything. They want to have the control over me but those days are over. I am strong and I have taken my rightful place. My foot is stuck and I will be hard to budge.      Third, my confusion of my seemingly normal life take over. Where should I go? Why am I here? The more I change, the more confusion clouds my aura of being. Did I really use to be that person? My past engulfs me making me feel like I was more of a ghost in this world than a real person. The places I grew up in seems like figments of imagination I came up with. I question its existence therefore my existence too. Thinking of my past brings on a feeling of wistfulness and sadness that I stop questioning its existence . Sometimes, my wish is to go back and be that little girl of eleven with ice-cream in her hand and laughing hysterically which clutching her itch tie. But then how could I wish that. I was ignorant and gullible. I didn’t know the things I know now. I wasn’t dumb then, just ignorant. I was ignorant to a point where I didn’t know Africa existed. That alone makes me frown at my child self.       Whom should i blame? Right now, I am betting on the school system. I was taught ridiculous skills. I was taught that there was a god and that he’ll listen to you. But when was he during the worst days, no years of my life. Maybe he went deaf for a awhile or I was too quiet in my pleas. Am I wrong to stop believing? All these questions are yet to be answered but waiting for them to get answered is a waste so I might just go lay down.
20090225152007AA4qWxO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Heroism and Bean Filed question?	Heroism"       Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind, and in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual's character. Now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than any one else. Therefore, just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past: then they see it to be in unison with their acts. All prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then the prudent also extol.       "Bean Field"       When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture, and even I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.       Which of the two essays reveals a more romantic, warm, down to earth voice? Why?       Which writer is more focused on nature and which on human behavior? How do you know?       Describe what you did and didn't understand about these 2 passages. Could you figure out what certain words meant even if you hadn't seen them before? If so, what strategies did you use to understand these passages.       Yes, I know theys are homework questions but I've read the two excerpts three times and still can't seem to answer those questions. I really just don't understand what they want me to write. Can someone please help me? Best answer will be picked.   Thanks so much,

20090225152219AAqoEAr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this short story, Salvador Late or Early?	Salvador Late or Early    Sandra Cisneros       Salvador with eyes the color of caterpillar, Salvador of the crooked hair and crooked teeth, Salvador whose name the teacher cannot remember, is a boy who is no one’s friend, runs along somewhere in that vague direction where homes are the color of bad weather, lives behind a raw wood doorway, shakes the sleepy brothers awake, ties their shoes, combs their hair with water, feeds them milk and cornflakes from a tin cup in the dim dark of the morning.       Salvador, late or early, sooner or later arrives with the string of younger brothers ready. Helps his mama, who is busy with the business of the baby. Tugs the arms of Cecilio, Arturito, makes them hurry, because today, like yesterday, Arturito has dropped the cigar box of crayons, has let go the hundred little fingers of red, green, yellow, blue, and nub of black sticks that tumble and spill over and beyond the asphalt puddles until the crossing-guard lady holds back the blur of traffic for Salvador to collect them again.       Salvador inside that wrinkled shirt, inside the throat that must clear itself and apologize each time it speaks, inside that forty-pound body of boy with its geography of scars, its history of hurt, limbs stuffed with feathers and rags, in what part of the eyes, in what part of the heart, in that cage of the chest where something throbs with both fists and knows only what Salvador knows, inside that body too small to contain the hundred balloons of happiness, the single guitar of grief, is a boy like any other disappearing out the door, beside the schoolyard gate, where he has told his brothers they must wait. Collects the hands of Cecilio and Arturito, scuttles off dodging the many schoolyard colors, the elbows and wrists crisscrossing, the several shoes running. Grows small and smaller to the eye, dissolves into the bright horizon, flutters in the air before disappearing like a memory of kites.       it kinda makes me sad, but im obsessed with reading this lol idk y tho      if you dont get some parts just ask and ill try to explain

I like to read, it makes me really happy, and i haven't quite figured out why yet. Sadly, ive read every book in my house, and I'm stuck on ideas for a new book. Some of my favorite books ive read, most recently are from stephanie meyer. Not for the vampires she has in her most popular book series "twilight" and not for the aliens in "the host" but for the real life applications. Ive attempted to read a book mainly about aliens or vampires and i just cant.   so i guess im looking for something with fiction in it, but it still has meaning to the overall book, and is actually entertaining to read.   help?

20090128150723AAEtqXz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Ok, does this sound like a good book?	It is about two twin daughters who are born to King Neptune and Queen Miranda of the sea. They are rulers of the Pacific Ocean and are of course merpeople. When Miranda gave birth to thses two beautiful mermaid princesses (Who are twins but don't look alike) she names the first born "Cordelia" (COR-DEAL-YA) who has bright blue eyes and wavy blonde hair. (Not as a baby of course.) And she names the second one who is born exactly a minute after Narissa who has dark brown wavy hair and green eyes. (NA-RISS-A) Cordelia is born at 12:00 and Narissa at 12:01. So Miranda has a sister named Mecanes. (MECK-A-NIS) Mecanes wanted to marry Miranda's husband, Neptune, but he married her sister. So now Mecanes is all mad at Miranda and that night starts a terrible storm. The storm is powerful it killed many people in Aquarius. (Place in the Pacific Ocean) And that night Miranda was next to Cordelia and Neptune was with Narissa. So Miranda swam away as fast as she could with Cordelia and Neptune the same wit Narissa. So they were seperated and never saw each other again.       One day, Miranda saw a beautiful shell on the beach. It was purple and white and pink with little cheetah looking spots. So Miranda didn't want to bring Cordelia on the beach, so she put Cordelia in a basket on the side of a boat and swam up to get the shell. While she was getting the shell, the boat was driven away with baby Cordelia in the basket. So Miranda is so angrey that she throws the shell far into the ocean. But she has a key necklace which catches on to it. So the shell has the key in it and was thrown so far no body would ever see it again. One day, Neptune was out looking for food for Narissa and Narissa was stolen by a robber from Pisces. (Bad part of the Pacific Ocean.) That very same night, he goes to play poker with a bunch of other mermen. (Who are like drunk and robbers.) But this robber loses the game and has to give the winner Narissa. When the winner of the game came home and went to sleep, his wife didn't think it was right. So when he was asleep, she swam up to shore (mermaids turn into humans at night when on land.) And in a hurry to get back home, she put her on a doorstep of a house.      So Cordelia was taken in by the family that owned the boat and Narissa was taken in by the people who found the crying baby on their doorstep. The Knight Family replaced the name of "Cordelia Fins" (which they of course did not know about) and made her name "Carly Knight. The other family replaced "Narissa Fins" with "Makalya Hernandez.      So when they both are sixteen Makalya moves to San Diego, California where Carly lives. They both meet and find that they have special powers. And they both end up falling through portals and ending up in Aquarius where their parents are. In those sixteen years Miranda and Neptune had found each other. But Mecanes is still out there, wanting revenge. A lot of interesting thinks happen in the book. Kind Neptune is almost murdered by an unworthy butler of the castle, Carly falls in love with servant, Makalya and Carly meet many new friends....so trustworthy, some not. They end up having to fight Mecanes, Mika (The jappense woman who gave Narissa a home but turned evil) and Namrem (Which is merman spelled backwords and also is the girl's uncle who has turned to the "dark side") And they have to destory a floating ball of evil made of air? And their aunt who tried to kill them?      Does it sound good?

20090128144905AAQfbGg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Third entry for my story ( I STILL NEED A TITLE!!) ?	June 20th      Father introduced our new sorcerer. His name is Leo. I am quite intrigued by him. He is tall, as all sorcerers are. Yet he is different. I have seen many sorcerers in my day ( well all of my sixteen years) and all of them are very skinny. He wasn't fat, yet he wasn't skinny. All sorcerers have grey hair, he has brown. I thought he wasn't a sorcerer, but boy was I wrong. He showed me the first spell a sorcerer learns, he can make a symphony out of bugs. YES BUGS! It was very gross and peculiar at first, but very pretty. I didn't think this was magic, but it was like he controlled them, he told them when to go and they listened.         Today I had to get fitted for my wedding dress. No, I am not getting married. But since I am not growing anymore ( The family elf Doctor, Merlin, says so) , they decided to fit me. It is white and has a long train in the back. the sleeves are made of lace, and the fabric is a very soft silk. It is so beautiful, yet I felt a sadness when I wore it. I was told that my mother sewed it a couple days before my sixteenth birthday. she was going to give it to me, but then she got sick, with the Black Death.           Oh how I hate the Black Death there is no cure, and once you get it, there is so treatment. You are watched by an elf nurse until you die. First, you get very weak, to the point where you cannot walk. Then you almost become brain dead. you cannot speak, you cannot move, nothing. Then all symtoms go away. Then, you die, and when you do your face becomes a sickly black color.         I hope Father doesn't get it, or me, or Sarina. If we did, I don't lnow what I would do.

Hello, i had another yahoo account but i can get into it. anyway im back with my wacky ideas for books. heres 2 i thought of. tell me which is better and which would you read. any suggestions would be accepted.      Idea#1: A florist in brooklyn named abraham is a normal guy during the day. he keeps his flower shop neat. his assitant is a young girl named sheri. she just joined him at the flower shop. at day abraham is tender and nice. his mother died from blamaspasm in which your eyeballs have seizures or spasms. At night he goes to the cemetary that he works near and digs up a recently deceased corpses. he will then have conversations with them and act them out, he will feed them, and when he is done he dances with them. he doesnt have sex with them as he is not a necrophiliac. Abraham is aware of what he is doing but cannot stop. i cant reveal much more but thats it for now.      idea#2: A man is in jail for grand theft auto and he gets hit and sexual abused by the other inmates. he is in a coma on the shower floor and in his mind, god appears to him. god tells him to "use the pure souls to do away with the wicked" When the man gets raleased from jail he breaks into kids houses and recruits them. he tells them thatthey will be saved and god will love them. when these kids follow him, he has them kill people who have done sins. i cant reveal more.      please let me know what you think, which one i should finish, any suggestions, which one you like better. i am 13 by the way and i published only 30 books roughly 300pages in each. please let me know what you think

Sonder swung his warhammer into the belly of the creature. Its icy fat closed around his hammer. Just one monster left. Only one and he could shine in his blood-earned freedom. Only one. It would not be as easy as the other two, this one was the group leader, Four months moveing though frozen tundras to even get a whiff of the icy creatures stench. How long before he found the last?    Sonder drew his hammer from the icy trolls stomach, he drops it onto the tundra as it slightly cracks through, as he says: "A blunt bloody hammer makes for a difficult draw," he said quitley to himself.    Sonder, walks through the dreary freezing cold woods with the crunch of dead roots and weeds sticking the the tundra. He finds himself standing right there infront of the icy troll with his back turned facing the ground. Sonder tries to approach the scary looking beast at quitley as he could "crunch" Sonder steps on a twig, the icy creature turns its cold, stone shaped face around, long with his big chubby body. The troll withdraws his might stoneaymore, and bashes at right at Sonder. With his quick reflexes he dodges the bash and hides behind a tree. The troll did not see Sonder run to hide, Sonder is tired, his muscles are filled with pain the icy air is crawling down platebody, under his tunic down his back he must kill this creature. " come out come out, where ever you are! said the troll in the most disgusting scariest voice Sonder has ever heard. Sonder was shivering, not only from the cold but the fear. Sonder took out his croosbow which was strapped to his back and..wham! Sonder hit the ugly creature right in the left leg. The troll made a ear bleeding screeech. Sonder dropped his bow and clamped his hands over his icy ears. after Sonder recovered from that the shriek he picked up his bow and shot him in the legs. Another ear splitting screech. Sonder withstanding the screech runs up to the beast. The beast jsut opens his eyes and see's Sonder just in time and smack!... the creature shoots out his hand and swipes Sonder right in the ribs, Sonder goes flying back back into the woods that surroded them, he went so far he lost sight of the fowl creature, though he could still smell the disgusting smell. Sonder gets up dragging his swords against the tundra as he walks back through the forest in attempt of finsihing him off. the swords makes a deep trail trough the tundra. Once sonder finally gets a visual on the creature. He only had two crassbow arrowws left and he sued them so he had to go for a head on attack. the creature was ready this time but sonder had an idea. Sonder came running ups traight fooling the creature ( ice trolls lack of intelligence ) then  he swiftly turns to the left the creaute has very very bad reflexes then Sonder slashes into the calf of the troll and the troll falls to the ground a puddle of blood lay under him then off to the left of the troll there it is.. half the trolls leg alay on the ground. Sonder finsishes off the troll with a stab trough its skull with his sharp dagger. He cuts of his head and walks back to the castle down south, with his noble stead. Sonder's quest was a victory.

20090128165523AAVmPAn	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I can't remember the title of a book I read a long while ago and I would like to read it again.?	It was a fantasy book about a guy that lived in some forest with his mom. She had wings and he was at the age that he should be getting them soon. There was a fire and the mother died. He then went through the forest with a man he met. There were people that were killing others, they were wearing masks that were evil. The two of them go on and are trying to tell people about the evil people with the masks. He eventually gets his wings, very few males have them. I think I remember something about a king. There is a war between the good people and the evil masked people. Towards the end, there is a ceremony for the newly winged character to become a "man" but the other male with wings in the community does not want him to become one. Eventually he gets through the ceremony. In the end, the man he was traveling with dies.      I know it may sound weird, but I absolutely loved the book. I read this book probably between 2002-2004 but it wasn't in the greatest condition then so it is possibly a bit older than that. Also, I'm not completely sure, but it may have been part of a series.      Please let me know if you have any idea what the title of the book is or if you may know an author.      Thanks a bunch :)
20090128155022AALTdlE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this story line sound good?	Four teenagers. With their own horrible backgrounds, come up with a plan. they want to commit suicide. Not just because of the problems theyve all faced, but just to send a message to the ones who have permanently damaged their lives. They want to make an impact on their community. They dont want others to suffer like they have and they dont want the ones who made them the way they are to act like nothing was wrong with the many mistakes they made. Therefore, the teens decide to jump, off a four story building, to show others how important it is to care, to treat each other descently, and to understand.         The story set-up will kinda be like this:   Prologue.   Part 1 First character's story   Part 2 Second story   Part 3 Third story   Part 4 Fourth persons story   Resolution.   Epilogue.         how do you think this will be? btw:Please, please, dont steal my idea though, it really is one of those ideas where the person has gave everything inside them to come up with.

I thought I was because Alice saw Bella jump of the cliff… then I know she told Rosalie…      Was it then Rosalie who told Edward.       Then I know he called Bella’s Jacob answered, acting like Carlisle and Jacob told him that Charlie was at the funeral. Confirming what Edward heard.       Anyways… just a bit confused, because Rosalie was saying sorry and crap, should it mainly be Alice’s fault. Even though Alice wasn’t’ entirely to be blame, Bella did jump of the cliff :P       Just need some clarification!! That would be greatly appreciated.       Ohh I was soo happy when Edward came back, but the pain and heartache he put Bella through was soo unfair!!!

20090128180944AA3PuWk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me with my book! Please...?	For years I've had book ideas in my head but never had the motivation to focus and actually write them down.       I also know that once I start, it would become (and have to be) an obsession. I'm the sort of person who stays awake all night to finish something I've started, even if I have time the next day to do it. I read all 4 Twilight books within a week and it consumed my every thought during that time (saw the movie for the 2nd time last night so it's returned to my thoughts again!).    I read all 7 Harry Potter books in 2 weeks and grieved their disappearance when I'd finished the last one.   I don't do things by halves!   It's because I recognise this single-minded preoccupation in myself that I procrastinate when it comes to starting something I enjoy doing. I KNOW I'll become manic and fixated on it and rob time away from my family and friends to feed it.      But, finally I have some time to be obssessed by a project and have thought of a concept that has really inspired me and managed to tear me away from Twilight websites! It's something I really want to write and that I would want to read.      Problem is, I can't get my head around a setting for the concept. I have the characters in my head and the emotion of the story, I just can't piece it together in a way that makes the story interesting, believable and relevant.      The basic idea I have is (surprise, surprise) a love story. I'm a sucker for heartbreaking love stories and I know I want the love story to be the central thread the story is created around.      So here is the nucleus of my story, I just need some help with the setting and conflict.      Girl and Boy (18ish, strangers to each other) have grown up knowing they will have an arranged marriage - some sort of political agenda?      As they get older they (girl especially) rebel against not having a choice in who they marry and they want to marry for love.      Girl meets boy in neutral place that doesn't give away who each of them are. They fall in love over a few clandistine meetings without knowing who each other really are (the "who they really are" part is one of the things I need help with and will be dependant on setting).      Girl is given birthday gift of a glimpse into the future which predicts that disaster (to her family or herself) will occur if she marries her betrothed.    She takes this to mean that the arranged marriage is cursed and she must avoid it at all costs which ties in nicely with her wanting to choose anyway.   Until she knows who the betrothed is, she won't be able to figure out what the disaster will be if she married him and so she can't go to her parents to dissuade them from an arranged marriage. She must hold the secret until the puzzle makes sense in order to avert the disaster and save her family/herself.   INTRODUCING HEARTBREAKING LOVE TWIST    When she is introduced to her betrothed, it is the boy she is in love with.    She can't marry him because he is the betrothed one, but she can't be with anyone else because it is him she loves.   They are now able to spend lots of time with each other under the pretence of getting to know their betrothed before the wedding, but instead they fall deeper in love and at the same time recognise the reason why the union will end in disaster (insert your idea here!).   Seeing no way around the problem, Girl flees in hopes that Boy will forget her and marry someone else.   Anguish, despair, tears etc etc etc for month on both sideas.   Boy believes Girl mustn't love him and so agrees to another betrothal.   In the mean time, Girl discovers a solution to quandry (insert idea here) and rushes back to find Boy, only to be told he is to marry someone else.   More tears, angst, self-torture etc etc.   At altar Boy realises he can't marry anyone but Girl and walks out on marriage determined to end his life.   At 11th hour Girl and Boy manage to get to each other and vow to never leave each other but to work together on solving conflict.      End book 1.      Book 2  - working together, Girl and Boy try to avoid the future shown to girl and allow them to marry. In process Girl and Boy must separate AGAIN for the sake of the bigger picture. Perhaps girl must pretend she will marry someone else for political strategy with Boy watching on helpless?   Book 3 - conclusion and Girl and Boy FINALLY get it together.      Um, er, that's it.      That's what I have going round and round my head and I'm desperately trying to mold it around a setting and conflict I'm comfortable writing about.      So far I have considered and 90% discounted an Indian setting (arranged marriage) because I'm not comfortable with writing a Bollywood novel which is how I imagine it would turn out.       The other option is a fantasy land in days of yore a'la Lord of the Rings. However, I'm not a huge fantasy reader and it doesn't appeal to me to write something that I wouldn't be attracted to read myself.   The thought of creating a whole other world is quite daunting and I'm rubbish at invent

20090128172457AA4zVBr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	This book that I can't remember?	Okay so I saw the book and movie for this name that I can't find.  I tried googling bits and parts of what I remember.    So there is this scrawny kind of kid who is disabled and I remember that he ends up sitting on his friend's shoulder.  His appearance is really tall and kind of hefty.  I remember in one scene the two of them get chased by a group of kids that don't like him so the only way to save themselves is if they walk through the river.  I want to remember the title of this book but I just can't.  Also in the book, the scrawny kid wants to become something in the medical field and he eventually dies in the end I think.  In the beginning he is flying an airplane he built.  If you could tell me what book this is that would be a great help.  Thanks!

20090128160414AAUfNWx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is this poem stating?	MY mother bore me in the southern wild,     And I am black, but O, my soul is white! White as an angel is the English child,     But I am black, as if bereaved of light.  My mother taught me underneath a tree,     And, sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissèd me,     And, pointing to the East, began to say:  'Look at the rising sun: there God does live,     And gives His light, and gives His heat away, And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive     Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.  'And we are put on earth a little space,     That we may learn to bear the beams of love; And these black bodies and this sunburnt face     Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.  'For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,     The cloud will vanish; we shall hear His voice, Saying, "Come out from the grove, my love and care,     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice."'  Thus did my mother say, and kissèd me,     And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,  I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear     To lean in joy upon our Father's knee; And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him, and he will then love me.

20090128193414AA9QnEV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Another book idea/let me know?	okay let me get straight to it      Idea#1: a cruel man is mean to his family and his workers. one day he dies from a heart attack from yelling at his worker who bought him a decaf instead of non decaf. he wakes up in a white robe and is in a blank room. his hair is gone. he walks through a door into an old style courtroom. their are ghostly figures sitting in the pews. the judge tells him to come foward and sit down. he has no judges as no ghost wanted to be his judge. they go through a file of his life, discussing all the mean things he has done to people and how unfair and cruel he is to the world. the judge after seven chapters determines that he should be sent to hell. he doesnt cry or anything. the judge asks him if he is sorry for what he has done. he then makes a great speech that i didnt work on and then the judge sends him to what he thinks is hell. but because he has apoligized, he goes to heaven.         Idea#2: The story takes place in russia and the main charecter is a child who only has his mother. this book shows how the harsh conditions and enviorment in russia can change somebody. a boy yet to be named, lives in russia. he is a sweet little boy when he is young. i wll make each chapter a year of his life, he will grow up and turn bad because of the problems in russia. he will grow angry and frustrated.      Idea#3:  this short story is about an assasian yet to be named that feels that he gains energy from killing his victims. he feel that he will turn god-like if he continues killing. i might have him die in the book or live not sure.      ok i know these ideas arent the best check my other posts. please choose   which is your favorite   which can be turned into a movie   which should i start writing first   suggestions   title for each idea   thank you all

20090128184927AAYrb4x	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight vs Harry Potter. Which series is better?	LOL!!! Made you look! Don't worry, I use the search bar. They should never be compared. I'll add some FACTS below. (I'm all for proof) I agree that everyone has their own opinion, but people who say that Twilight is more popular than Harry Potter and that HP fans are "jealous" are ridiculous. Again, sorry for wasting your time, but please don't report me. BTW, only give thumbs up to fellow answerers. There is no right answer, (duh, not a question) so be nice. Have a happy day!

20090128213223AAc81ye	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do u like my characters?	irst we have Joe. he is a "genuine good guy. he is in his late 20s.he is short and muscular but overall average looking. his big heart makes up for his shortcomings. he loves sports and he works the night shift at one of the largest banks in the country. soon he will be laid off but is afraid to tell his girlfriend as their relationship has been strained lately. he loves lorelei with all his heart and she is number one in his life. he knows she treats him like dirt but loves her too much to let go. his short stature gives him low self-esteem so he keeps the sexy lorelei on his arm like a trophy. he doesnt think he can do any better than her.       next we have Lorelei(Joe's girlfriend) same age as Joe. she is tall and skinny and hot and she knows it. she has long ravenous brown hair and a curvacious body. she is snobbish with expensive taste. she loves guys with money which Joe has very little of. she was an adopted only child of parents who spoiled her and Joe has also been spoiling her for the past 7 years. but she is having doubts about the relationship as Joe has little time to spend with her mostly due to his strange work schedule. she has tried to leave Joe a couple of times but he begs her to stay. she feels guilty so she sticks with him. things had been so promising when she met Joe. thats when he was a pre-med student. she works in a grocery store and hates her job. but she likes the new manager and his large salary. she is constantly pointing out to Joe that other men would be better candidates than him. she also has a mouth like a sailor      then we have Ally. she is in her mid 20s. 4 years younger than Joe and Lorelei. non-smoker, light drinker(due to an incident on one particular occassion) she is short with a sexy body and a great personality. she likes to have fun and loves music. she has light brown hair and eyes like emeralds. she has a pointy nose and perfect teeth. but she is constantly chewing gum. she has a tattoo on the small of her back. her nose is pierced and so is her right eyebrow. she doesnt have a thing for pain but likes expressing herself through her skin. however she is not planning on doing anything else to her body. she is a sweetheart. kind, caring and loving. she is a cocktail waitress at a strip club. the job is fun and the money is great. she is not greedy as she gives Joe the money back when she tips him. this is what makes her unique along with the fact she is sweet even though she has the piercings. And while every other guy is lusting over her body, it is her big heart which Joe becomes attracted to. she works a lot as she is trying to pay her rent as well as make enough money for next semester's tuition plus she has a lot of credit card debt. she has a history of bad relationships as she is a terrible judge of character and would like to meet one "genuine good guy". the younger Ally will give Joe the kick in the pants he needs to do something he really likes.       are these strong characters and what else do u want to know?   also which one is your favorite so far?   im looking for ways to build on these characters so tell me your opinions or ideas to make these characters stronger and this story better

20090128210608AAgr4ky	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Within this story which of the 7 deadly sins is the most apparent?	As I woke up, I shielded my eyes from the sun that poured through the oak window. My body laid in crisp white sheets as flashbacks rushed through my mind.    "'…Do you want to?'"    "'…I don't know, I don't think we should.'"    "'…We'll be fine, don't worry.'"    I pushed myself up against the bed's backboard and rubbed my temples, I felt nauseas and sore. I climbed out of my warm bed, wrapped a bed sheet around my body, and twisted it into a knot above my chest.    Items seemed in disorder as I walked through my loft bedroom. While glancing over the rest of the loft, I spotted a folded piece of paper leaning against a vase on the dinner table. I unfolded the paper and began to read the note.                                "Dear Sherry ,    Thanks for a great night. We should do it again sometime.                    Ps. welcome to the world of AIDS. "   Thump thump, thump thump.    I felt numb; there was something in my throat that I just couldn't   swallow. The note dropped to the table, knocking something to the floor. My eyes never wandered to the floor, my heart ached to much to care.   Once again, flashbacks raced through my mind from the beginning of the night to the end.    "'…Would you like to dance?'"    "'…Maybe the next song'"    "Tommy? Tom? Tomas? Timmy? Troy?" I repeated to myself trying to remember his name, for the alcohol fogged my memory.    "'…Hi, I'm Tristan.'"    "'…Hey, Nice to meet you. I'm Sherry.'"    I paced around the loft as tears moistened my cheeks. The bed sheet fell to the floor as I walked to the bathroom and started the shower. Immediately, steam filled the tiny plain room and fogged the mirror.    I closed my eyes as the water poured from the showerhead onto my face. "I can wash it away, everything will be alright." I kept repeating these words, trying to fool myself into believing them, even though I knew it wasn't true.   When I was in the shower I felt pure. Turning the knob all the way to the left was the hardest thing to do, my moment of purity was over and I was insecure about everything.    I stepped out of the shower; right foot, then left and wiped the mirror clear of fog. While checking my reflection, in the smudged mirror, an unclear figure crept behind me and passed through the door. Puddles of water formed under my feet as I followed the figure through the doorframe.    "Who's there?" I received no answer.   Thump thump, thump thump.    My heart raced. I peeked around the wall, which separated the bathroom from the living room, and held my breath. The floor crept under my feet as I approached the dark figure. My hand shook as I reached for the overcoat that covered a body.   One, two, three. Swoosh, the overcoat fell to the ground.    Beep, beep, beep. "Good morning New York City, you're listening to W.T.B.A and it is 7:00 AM. It's starting to feel a lot like winter with a temperature of 34° F, time to take those winter jackets out of the clos-"    I slapped my hand on the off button and the alarm clock fell to the floor. My body jerked up and I scratched my neck gasping for air. Confused and unsure of myself I got out of bed and inspected my loft. I glanced at the vase and to my surprise, there was no note waiting to be read. My eyes wandered around in concern and fear that someone was lingering within my loft but I was alone.    The days of my past haunted me. Tristan, a demon from my past , never left me alone: not even in my sleep. I thought about that day frequently, the day I met Tristan.    "Sherry!" Lisa Shouted. "Sherry wait for me!"    I turned around and saw my best friend Lisa charging right at me.     "What's up Lisa?"     "There's a party at Kenny's place tonight, wanna go?"    "Sure but I have to be home early to study for my chem. test tomorrow. Come by my house around 7."    Lisa smiled and winked, that was her way of saying "I'll catch you later."     Lisa showed up at my house right on time. We got ready and headed over to Kenny's house for a party we jokingly said "we would never remember." As soon as we walked into his pent-house he embraced us and introduced us to Caption Morgan, a drink I couldn’t refuse. After 7 drinks I was sick and ready to leave, but then I met Tristan. He seemed like a nice guy, he was tall, dark and handsome. Everything a girl looks for in a guy. But there was something strange about him.     "'…Would you like to dance?'"    "'…Maybe the next song'"    When rejected, Tristan became someone else, someone I didn’t want to know.   I didn’t stick around for the next song I was ready to leave. The garage for Kenny’s pent-house was dark and humid. A sinister feeling gathered in the steamy air. Footsteps echoed as I walked to the Exit door. My heart began to beat rapidly when I discovered the echoed footsteps were not mine. I glanced over my shoulder and found no one pacing behind me. I turned the corner in front of a Honda and looked into the round mirror that was mounted onto the wall above me. In the mirror I spotted a man clad in black, crawl behind the H

20090128185417AAaJ0gc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read a story like this (Section of Story Added!)?	It's called "I'm Kinda Loving You".    "So, basically what it's about is a girl who's not used to the whole "High-School-Sweethearts" thing. She actually hates the simple thought of it. So she doesn't date. She just doesn't.     Then...HE comes.    This guy David. He walks through the door, just like everyone else, sits down at a desk, just like everyone else, talks to Franki, just like..well, some people, and absolutely blows her mind away, like no one else before. Out of fear of falling in love with this kid (which she's basically borderline of doing), she tries to hide her feelings best as she can. She tries to play "Hard-To-Get" and completely sucks at it. Tries to ignore him but doesn't want to just completely shut him off, yet she doesn't want to get close either. Franki's one confused girl who thinks she might love this David guy, and completely and utterly hates it."      Haha, I just thought of making a story like this..  I might change the plot a bit (maybe a lot) but this is the only solid thing I've made up so far. Soooo, would you read something like this?!      Thanks in advance for all criticism!

First here is the summary, A young girl named Beth Madison turns into a vampire on her thirteenth birthday from a family curse, she is shipped off to a vampire city found under the ground, and her best freind seems to have another secret, he is a vampire slayer along with his evil brother. It is from her point of view. Here is the prologue:      One day my teacher had asked me a question, a very difficult question no doubt, even though I didn’t know that then, it was supposedly related to a book we were reading, a science-fiction. “Now class if we had a choice of immortality or the life we had now, which would you choose?” She had asked. My answer was the obvious answer any human would have picked; immortality. I had only thought of the positives of being able to live forever, not the negative side. If I had thought of the possibilities of being immortal, would I have still chosen it? I ask myself. Day after day I still ask my self this question.

20090128205822AAVdW2P	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Do I even possibly have the slightest chance?	Okay so I really have this insane passion for music, but there are alot of stipulations upon this passion of mine.      I have been playing the piano ever since my freshman year  of highschool and I did okay, not necessarily great, because I was working with a private piano teacher for a couple of years and then I stopped over the spring because she had to move. Anyway to make a long story short, I have been learning alot by ear and it has been very hard,  am still just not that good.      The thing is I am a junior in highschool now and I still love playing the piano, but I definately feel as if I am not good enough for music school. I can't really read any sheet music and I haven't really had any good ground with music theory.      But would it be too late to make a turn around?   Could I still be able to work hard enough to end up pursuing my dream still?       Or should I just face the fact I could not be able to do in a realistic viewpoint?

20090128194939AAnSd4l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Macbeth experts please help!?	I'm writing an essay about Macbeth and the topic is to discuss Macbeth's reliance upon the supernatural to determine his destiny. So basically, my thesis statement is going to be "Macbeth's reliance on the witches' prophesies led to his downfall because he grew too ambitious, he was ill prepared for war, and...   Or should it be "Macbeth's reliance on the supernatural makes him too ambitious because he kills anyone in his way, he does not prepare for battle, and...   I cannot think of anything for the third part, someone please help me! I'm not looking for you to write the essay for me, I just need a boost from my writer's block! Any suggestions as how to reword my thesis would also help.   Thank you in advanced

He has various adventures throughout the series, one of which involves him going to Mars and meeting Moon colonists/farmers there (who farm 'mungos' amongst other things), along with a group of Martians who have been fighting with the colonists.    The series is written slightly tongue-in-cheek. Was published in the 70s and most likely is out of print. The series makes subtle prods at the Apollo astronauts for being backwards technologically.

When the children were at school the parent’s house caught on fire. The house burned to the ground, and their parents had died. They had no choice and were forced to live in a foster family. Although they did not like this they had to do their best. Their social worker tried to do their best to find a family who would take all three of the children. They finally found parents. They were filthy rich. But the thing was they didn’t want them they wanted them to be like slaves.     The oldest one was Gabriella Brooks. She was 15 years old and had long brown hair. She always wore her hair down, except for when she knew she was in for an adventure. She always had some special talent so she always new when she was in for a big adventure. She is slim with tan skin. She always wore dresses. She loved dresses she never really quiet knew why. Her favorite dress was a long pink dress with white flowers. It had puffed sleeves. It was her favorite because her mom had made it especially for her. The second oldest is Adam Brooks. He’s 12 years old. He has light brown hair. He had tan skin. He was slim too, but very tall. He loved to play sports. His favorite sport was golf. He always loved to play it with his dad. Now, Adam had something very special also. He had a cross necklace. It was very special to him because it was sent down generation to generation. He always wore it ever since he got it on his 6th birthday. It was a tradition in his family to give it to your son on their 6th birthday. Now for the youngest of them all, Lilly Brooks. She is 7 years old. She has short brown hair, and blue eyes. She is tall with very light skin. She was very young but very smart for her age. She loved to sing. She got her wonderful voice from her mother. Lilly always wore a ring that she had got when she was first born. It had the words” LIVE, LAUGH, LOVE’ engraved onto it.   Now one day when he children were in the library in they’re foster parents house Adam had found a book. A book that looked very old. He pulled the book out of the shelf. It was so old it had gathered dust. He brushed the dust off and looked at the title. The title said” The Great adventure of ___________” I wonder what this book is about. Adam thought to himself. While the others where discovering the rest of the library he decided to read some of it. As time went by Adam got more and more interested in the book.” Gabriella! Lilly!, Come check out this book its really good.” Yelled Adam. Gabriella and Lilly came rushing to him. “Hey, Gabriella help Lilly read this aloud.” Adam said. So all three of the children were reading the book aloud. All of a sudden Gabriella stopped reading. ”Oh no!’ Gabriella said in shock. “What’s Wong?” asked Adam. Gabriella Grabbed a ribbon from her pocket and pulled her hair back. “Oh no!” said Adam. “We are in for an adventure aren’t we?” asked Adam. The children held each others hands. They did this to make sure whatever happens, they are all going together not one left behind. They continued reading while holding hands. They read two more paragraphs and then the book started to shake. Lilly screamed! The children all held their hands even tighter. Soon, they began to shake. They had began to get sucked into the book. They all screamed. And in a second they had completely disappeared and entered the new world of __________.
