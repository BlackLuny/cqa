20090306160157AAz9qrQ	News & Events;Current Events	Hey obama fans not such a good public speaker Huh?	President Barack Obama doesn’t go anywhere without his TelePrompter.      The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president’s prepared remarks follow him wherever he speaks.      Resting on top of a tall, narrow pole, they flank his podium during speeches in the White House’s stately parlors. They stood next to him on the floor of a manufacturing plant in Indiana as he pitched his economic stimulus plan. They traveled to the Department of Transportation this week and were in the Capitol Rotunda last month when he paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln in six-minute prepared remarks.      Obama’s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual — not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events, large and small.      After the teleprompter malfunctioned a few times last summer and Obama delivered some less-than-soaring speeches, reports surfaced that he was training to wean himself off of the device while on vacation in Hawaii. But no such luck.

I haven't listened to him in years, but I am starting to tune him in again. I even saw CNN talking about Limbaugh. Never before have I seen so much concern about someone that isn't in politics.      We saw how they got fanatical with that plumber guy... think his name was Joe. You think it is those who expose them the most is who they go after instead of trying to explain things? I'm thinking they must not have an excuse for their actions.

I have been looking for an audio clip of or highlights from Kevin Rudd's speech that he made on August 7th (or maybe 8th) in 2008 at the Beijing Sofitel reception for Australian Olympians.  It was played a lot in the media at the time, but a search of the archives I can think of haven't had clips.  Even news pieces that include audio grabs would be useful.

I've read news articles over the internet and newspapers in which Russia moves towards aggression against the U.S. Is this something to do with Georgia? There was an article about some Russian guy predicting the collapse of the U.S. What's up with the hate? As an American, I think that most Americans don't really care what countries think about us because we know that America will always prevail and do what's always right. I just want to know the root cause of the seemingly aggravated relations of the two countries. I don't want another Cold War happening in such a difficult time for everyone.

I have read post calling this lady a gold digger and anxious for her husband's insurance policy.  You all are pathetic.

This man has lost his life, his parents have lost their child and his wife is a widow in her twenties and their  daughter is fatherless at 3 and all you can comment on is how his dad and wife don't respond to the situation the way you feel they should.  I pray this fate doesn't fall on your ignorant souls
20090307002254AA31POm	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Your thoughts on my response to the editor for a newspaper?	here is the article in our newspaper        http://www.presstelegram.com/search/ci_1...       please take the time and read and keep in mind i am doing this for high school government class and we get 50 ex points if it gets published in the newspaper       theis is my response      Ok ,let's change the terminology to civil union, as it's less controversial and best describes what we are fighting for. i oppose the govenment haveing the authority to legislate personal social decisions, i also oppose discrimination. those who oppose “civil union” are acting purely out of prejudce and bigotry to deny the benefits of state sanctioned monogamy based purely on the gender of the people involved.  its gender based discrimination, pure and simple. when you look at all the arguments against civil union, only the purely religious ones are even rational. we don't forbid people who are old/young  that are infertile from getting married, so it's not about procreation.  and though the religious arguments against are true as far as they go, our constitution forbids the government from acting based purely on religious grounds. if the only reason for something is religious, that cannot be enacted as law. the only question is how long it's going to take people to realize that prejudice, hatred and bigotry are inherently worse than any expression of love ever could be. domestic partnership are still legal in califonia, the churches need to stop wasting their money into Prop 8. If they want to ban gay marriage from the churches  let them, but we need to stop churches from corrupting are laws. the Declaration of Independence and Constitution have  phrases like "All men are created equal" and "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness". Why not let me have my happiness if it doesn't interfere with yours?

20090307130947AAmxfLX	News & Events;Other - News & Events	Put a hold on bank account to find out who is in charge of money at job?	My situation is that I work for private owners who have one private jet and i' been a first officer for going on 5 years and only make 30,000 euro while my captain who is been there 3 years makes 55.000 euro....The owners who own us make so much they don't even know they own us and on top of that we do many overtime shift and i do not get pay for. I already got screwed years back because the owners bought new aircraft and I didnt have enough hours logged on so they had to hire captain with enough hours, i dont even know who to ask for a pay raise , we have a flight manager but all he does is tell us where to go and when to be there other then that we get paid by wire and we do not know who is in charge of money, there was one woman who was human resource when i first started job but she been gone for years... We just had a new baby and my wife can no longer work, we sometimes fly the main owner but im scared to ask he is very powerful and is always too busy when we fly him.      I was thinking of putting a hold on me bank account so when they pay me next by wire it won't go thru and I can get the person who is in charge of money to notify me, this is only thing I can think of.
