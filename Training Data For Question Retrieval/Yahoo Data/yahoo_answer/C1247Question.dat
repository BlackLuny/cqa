I figured out a part of this problem but I can't seem to figure out the area equation for this problem Please help me..      You want to fence in your rectangular garden  and have $9000 to spend. One side (one of the x sides) needs a stronger fence to keep the cows out--materials will cost $10 per foot for this side. The other three sides can be fenced with less expensive materials at $5 per foot.       What is the area equation of the problem? Find the dimenisons which will maximize the area enclosed in the garden.      I found the cost equation for the fence and it is 9000= 15x+10y. but I don't think that has anything to do with finding the maximized area.

For an online class were supose to estimate our VO2 max.  I don't fricken get how you can multiply the gender at the end, if female=0???? Im I a retard???      PAR = Physical Activity Rating (mine is 8)   A = Age (in years) (im 25)   BMI = Body Mass Index   % fat = Percent body fat (multiplied by 100; e.g., 25% × 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25)   G = Gender (0 for women, 1 for men) (im female)      Formula Using Body Mass Index   First, determine your BMI using the following four-step formula:   1. Convert your body weight to kilograms by dividing your weight in pounds by 2.2.   Body weight ____145______ lb ÷ 2.2 lb/kg = body weight __________ kg   2. Convert your height measurement to meters by multiplying your height in inches by 0.0254.   Height ___64_______ in. × 0.0254 m/in. = height __________ m   .V   O2max         .   .   (continued)   3. Square your height measurement.   Height __________ m × height __________ m = height __________ m2   4. BMI equals body weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2).   Body weight __________ kg ÷ height __________ m2 = BMI __________ kg/m2   (from step 1) (from step 3)   Next, calculate based on this value for BMI:   VO2max = 56.363 + 1.921(PAR) – 0.381(A) – 0.754(BMI) + 10.987(G)   VO2max = 56.363 + (1.921 × ______) – (0.381 × ______) – (0.754 × ______)   (PAR) (age) (BMI)   + (10.987 × _______) = ______ ml/kg/min   (gender)

Using f(a) + f`(a)(x-a) for a = 0,    I calculate L(X) = 1 - (1/2)(X)      However, when I plug 0.9 in for L(X), I get 0.55 which is not even in the ballpark of sqrt(0.9), which is roughly equal to .9487.

So I have been looking at other people's questions and answers about evolution vs creation on here and decided to ask my own. Everyone is so fixed on the idea that evolution is true, and seem to be very stubborn about anything against it. But evolution supposedly occurred gradually over millions and billions of years, right? But, there aren't countless amounts of the "missing links" or transitional forms in the fossil record to back any of that up.      I have heard of some missing links that were supposed to be true, but that they were found out to be fake, a true animal, changed to appear as a transitional form, and etc.       And please, be civilized and intelligent with your answers people. I'm not trying to attack evolution, or open an opportunity for others to bash on evolution or creation. I simply want to know what others think about this without having everyone freak out and start being rude to me and other people.
