20090222154119AA6hi5J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question: Does this mean he would want to date me in the future?	I met this guy 3 years ago, and we became really good friends. The last few long term relationships he has had were with girls he has been "best friends" with. In fact, I really liked him, and he recently started dating a girl he kept referring to as his "Really close friend". Well, him and I were talking the other night. And randomly, he goes "You know I really suck at being close friends with a girl. There are girls I am KINDA friends with. But VERY few I would consider that close, best friend. And you are one of those girls.". Sooo, does that mean anything??

20090222154105AA85lOr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just tell him? =[?	So, i met this guy afew days ago   I met him through friends   Im really shy   so when i was talking to him he was saying stuff like "don't be shy" and he told me a bunch of reasons why i shouldn't stuff like " i made it through to the speech arts finals because of my confidence "   So that was the last time i talked to him. I only talked to him once.   So i was at my friends ( the one who I met the boy though)   I asked my friend to ask him what he thinks of me   heres the convo   Her: what did u think of her   Him;shes very shy   Her: yuh, but once u get to know her shes really nice   Him: yuh I thought so      So i like him, and i don wanna tell him cuz i JUST met him, he might get freaked out. Should i get my friend to tell him for me so that I don't g through too much pain ? Im not very bad looking I usually get a 7, 8 or 9 on scale of 1-10 for my looks. I dont want him to like me for my looks though just my personality and hes that sorta guy that ONLY looks for personality.my guts jut tell me somethings gonna go wrong.

20090222154433AAxrc1n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I "put out to soon" and now he is not interested!?	ok, so here gos.  I met up with someone on facebook from when I was back in Elementary school.  I was 2 years older than him so knew him a bit but know his family well and everything.  Now we started flirting a bit...then the sexy texts....then phone calls.  He said everything I wanted to hear and then some!  Now I thought EVERYTHING was great!  He even told me he used to have a crush on me back in school.  Well anyways we met up and I slept with him!!!!  I TOTALLY SCREWED UP!  For the month we were chatting and everything he would call every day or at least text and the day after we slept together he did call.   SO STUPID ME went back on my birthday when we had plans on going out and just had sex then I left!  This was OVER A WEEK ago!  He hasn't called, texted, or ANYTHING since!  Why do I keep letting men "burn" me like this!?  I REALLY liked this guy!  Is it to late or is there a chance?  I did text him on Wednesday and he texted back....but it was VERY casual.  He told me for my b-day we would go out...and everything.  I knew  he had to work the night before (overnight as he is a cop), so a week prior gave him an out saying we could get together a different day cause I didn't want to infringe on his sleep.  He said "No, no problem...I will just be a little tired".  SO on my way there he is telling me he is tired, and does not want to go out....etc.....BUT STUPID ME went there and got him laid!!!!  Am I THAT DESPARATE for attention?  Should I just let it go and take it as an OOPPPS on my part?  Should I get back to him if he decides to call?  Should I get revenge, if so Is there any way to get revenge for BURNING me on my birthday?  Should I try and play hard to get?  ANY AND ALL SUGGESTIONS are welcome!

20090222154605AAPpYJi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think my girlfriend is cheating on me. How can I tell if she is?	My and my girlfriend have been together for six years, and I trust her very much. For the past few weeks however, I have been thinking maybe she is having sex with someone else. I have found someone else underwear in her house but she says her brother left them there. I have found texts messages on her phone saying thanks for the great time last night from random guys and she said they are from people she "played cards with". Also I once saw a man with his penis inside her and she said, "We were just changing and I fell on my hands and knees and he fell penis first into my..."(you can fill in the blank) I have no  idea who this guy was but when I said okay I believe you to my girlfriend he started humping her, like he had trouble getting off her or something, for 15 minutes. So now she is mad at me for not trusting her. What can I do?

20090222154805AAHgs2k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am so unbelievably confused. Help please?	Okay, me and this guy have been hanging out for weeks now, and I've liked him for as long as I could remember.  We live in different towns and I only get to see him on the weekends.  He texted me one weekend and asked me who I like, and I told him that I liked him.  And he said he liked me, too, and that "we should do something about this".  I said "Okay, suggestions?"  And he asked me out.  Now ever since we started hanging out after that, things are extremely awkward.  When we're alone, we're all cuddly and close, but when there are people around, it seems like he wants nothing to do with me.  I like him so much and last night I told him how awkward I felt when we were together and around people and he said he "knows how I feel".  I asked him if he just wanted to be friends and he said that would be cool.  I'm dealing with the King of Mixed Messages and I don't know what to do.  Help please!

He said he wanted to show me something and then dragged me off upstairs which was closed, then he started to put his hands down my shorts and i told him to stop A LOT of times and pushed him away, but he kept going, i was pretty drunk and didnt really feel strong enough as he kept pushing his hand down, i persisted for a long time and then wen he started doing it i just gave up. he asked me to give him a ******** and made out it was only fair that i did, i was crying and did agree to, but as soon as i started i didnt want to, it made me gag as he kept pushing it further in, then i pulled away and he waited till he was going to come and shoved it in my mouth again, it tasted gross! i got up and ranaway before he could catch me again. Was all this my fault? did i lead him on and not protest enough to stop him?
20090222155759AAyrY1L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the SHY GIRLS, would you act like this around a guy you like?	There's a girl that I have a crush on right now.  I've never spoken to her, but we've had some of the same classes at college and I know from some people that I've heard talking about her that she's shy and has never had a boyfriend(she's gorgeous though).  But anyways, whenever I've seen her when we workout at the same place or in a store I've noticed that she seems to try to avoid looking at me when I'm looking in her direction, but only when I pass do I catch her looking quickly at me.  So if your a shy girl do you purposely avoid checking out a guy that you find attractive if you think he's gonna notice it?

Then one day i was sitting and she came and saw me. she reached her hand out and i held it and she did not mind at all. then were standing talking real close and she was talking to my friend and she gave him a side hug and her body was still facing mines. when i ran out of things to say she said she'll still stay even though im retardedly shy :[ then she gave me a hug again. whenever she sees me she would smile.   does she like me???

Now, a year later I still like him and he says that he is over me.      We went to a dance together as friends and while slow dancing, he closed his eyes...then we hung out yesterday and he kept putting his arm around me and he pushed my head back onto his shoulder. He also gave me a random neck massage for a second...      He is a "ladies' man" and is pretty playful with a lot of girls, so I don't really know if I'm any different.   It may seem obvious that what I SHOULD do is ask him, but...   Do you think that he likes me?
20090222155414AAGVBoV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I tell my mom?	Today my two little sisters told me that sometimes my dad will go into their room and touch them. Like when he wakes up one of my sisters as he is shaking her he will touch her in inappropriate places. My other sister said that he did it for the first time today but he wasnt waking her up he just was in her room and she woke up cuz she felt someone touching her. Now i'm 18 and have moved out and he has never did anything like this to me. But my sisters friend also says that he has done it to her to (but she tells a lot of stories, so i'm not sure i can believe her). I know i need to tell my mom, i'm just not sure how. My dad got laid off, so they are struggling to pay bills. My mom is working none stop so she has been really stressed lately, and my aunt and uncle are getting a divorce after 25 years and she's upset about that, so i'm afraid my mom wont be able to handle it. How do i tell her?
20090222155518AA0EvbV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would u consider this stealing?	4 xmas, my Gfs mom bought me a concert ticket to a show me and my Gf want to go too. So she bought my Gf a ticket too. well since then, my Gf has been the one keeping both of our tickets in her room.          other night she had some freinds over and we were all drinking. well i ended up having to much to drink so i started not feeling good and i told Gf this. so i went to bathroom and i ended up falling asleep in there the rest of the night lol. i didnt mean too but it just happened.         well she got pissed i never came back out of the bathroom the rest of the night so she grabbed my shoes and threw them out somewhere. granted they are only $100 shoes. so they definately werent anything special but still. that doesnt mean i want her throwing them out somewhere and losing them.       morning she says she doesnt remember where she threw them. anywho, i was mad, so without telling her, i took both our tix and took em home with me. later on i called her cuz i knew it was wrong of me taking hers as well. so i told her i had em. and i told her i would give hers back. but the second i mentioned i was going to be keeping mine she got livid and started bitching me out and saying that if i kept it, it was stealing. How the hell would that be stealing? it was MY gift.  and if me keeping that is stealing then how the hell is her throwing my shoes out and losing them not be stealing then.

20090222160443AAHrcYD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DO YOU GUYS THINK THIS GIRL LIKES ME OR NOT?	We're in high school in New York. We met 4 weeks ago over the phone from a friend, John, who is in my grade. We talked for hours and 500+ text messages since we met - but that was weeks ago. Anyway once when we were on the phone she invited me to her house like 5 times sorta kidding, I was like, "sure." i had a nickname. we flirted i guess. Right after we met we went somewhere, me, our friend, her and her other friend. She really really wanted me to go i mean really but we didn't say anything because i was mad and she was shy that day. but that's old.      a few weeks ago her friend Kim asked me if I liked her, and I said no because I thought she had a boyfriend, and she said, "No she doesn't have one," seeming as if i should ask her out. she was mad at Kim for a while (and me too but then appologized immensely) when i told her that.

20090222160233AAmPCnV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Nervous to date again?	Okay here is the down low. My ex broke up with me about 3 and a half months ago. He basically said he did not want a relationship and was in one less than two weeks later.I found out he cheated on me with a freshman in college and I am about to graduate college. I lost my virginity to him as well. Also he broke up over text messaging. When he sees my friends, he texts them saying her sees them. His new girlfriend even texts them. I want to date, but I am a bit nervous.
20090222160715AAgMjiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm mad at myself for liking him, for being his puppet[long]?	Right. I'm really timid, and shy. But decent looking. This guy, Jon, was the obnoxious class clown. He'd always tease me though. I had a guy friend Chris who I always talked to, and sometimes skip class with. We were really close. Jon sent threatening messages to Chris and told him I was too good for him, and he liked me, weird things like this. I never even really knew Jon either. He started to make fun of Chris, and things got really out of hand.      But I always secretly liked Jon from day 1, opp. attract and I thought he was funny. Things happened between me and Chris, we're no longer friends. But I'm mad at myself for liking Jon. He got what he wanted as well; me and Chris are no longer friends. I sold myself short because I liked Jon as well. Whenever Jon sees me he always looks at me like he likes me, and I'm also wondering how can you like someone you don't even know, me? I like him because he was funny, but I never talked. What would his motive be for threatening Chris out of my life?

I run a website called WaitForMarriage.com I am looking to put together a few testimonies of why people have chosen to remain abstinent until they are married and put their testimony on the website anonymously. Would anyone be willing to give a brief story of why they choose to remain pure? The top 3 will be put on the site as an article! You can write about why you are choosing it (if you are unmarried), or why you have remained abstinent in the past if you are married.
20090222160351AA1FfbJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does he HAVE to see him?	My 11 year old son has a different father then his siblings, but for 11 years I've thought his father was my other kids' father. We recently found out (through a DNA test) that was not true. My son HAS met his biological father, but he's only seen him one time after that. Very recently we moved near where his biological father lives because of my husband's job. Now my son's bio-father wants custody. I'd be happy with him seeing his son. But my son doesn't want to. He says that his dad died a year ago (that is man who fathers my other children except for my twins, who are my recent husband's. It's confusing I know. See, I was married. Had an affair. Got pregnant, thought it was my late husband's. never considered he was the guy I had the affair with. A few months ago the guy I had an affair with pops up-by now my husband I cheated on is dead and I'm remarried-and says he's the father. After a DNA test, we find out he is) and he doesn't have to see the man. He says that his REAL dad is the one who raised him for 10 years and if he does have another dad, it's his step-dad. He has told all of this to his bio-father.      His bio-father, however, is saying my son HAS to see him, at least sometimes, like once every two weeks. My son is still saying no. So his bio-dad is saying if I don't force my son to spend time with him, he will take me to court and take my son away!       Can he really do that? Does my 11 year old son HAVE to see his bio-dad if he doesn't want to?      If it helps we live in California now.

I haven't heard from him in more than two days and we were texting constantly. What do I do?

The last few long term relationships he has had were with girls he has been "best friends" with. In fact, I really liked him, and he recently started dating a girl he kept referring to as his "Really close friend". Well, him and I were talking the other night. And randomly, he goes "You know I really suck at being close friends with a girl. There are girls I am KINDA friends with. But VERY few I would consider that close friend. I consider you one of them you know.". Sooo, does that mean anything?? And also, is that a way of him saying I am his best friend?

20090222161843AA1gM1T	Family & Relationships;Friends	Wanting to see a friend more often (Just as friends) but she has a boyfriend so would it be ok?	There is a girl who is a really good friend and we enjoy each others company ALOT but things kinda get in the way and we hardly see each other because I'm home schooled and she goes to a "normal" school and she works at a super market in the evenings.      Would it be wrong to ask if she would want to hang out (just as friends, I don't have a thing for her) as she has a boy friend?      I'm asking cause it's kinda sad and funny how we don't see each other, we bumped into each other around Christmas time and she wouldn't let me go lol and we just talked for like two hours. It's sad cause she didn't know I had a one year old younger brother which is also kinda funny in a way.      So do you think it would be ok to ask if she wants to hang out? Just as friends.
20090222161721AAJFjLp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people have arranged marriages, they suck!...?	My parents arent the most friendly people they had an arranged marriages, and they dont have many friends because they dont like going out with one another, I have become shy and anti social because all throughout my childhood I never had any exposure to anyone except them, and I grew up alone because I have no brothers or sisters(even though I really want one). I have alot of friends in school my parents let me invite them over and they let me go out placed with them, but they dont ever talk to them, by talking to them I mean they greet them but they dont ask how they are or how their their parnents are, they dont really have any manners. I know them being anti social is because of their arranged marriage, i know it's a weird connection but it is. I really am alone and I hate their arranged marriage, I know someday they'll probably make me get one but I want to marry someone I love and someone I want to spend my life with, I'd rather marry nobody than marry some guy I dont like. But because I'm so shy I doubt a guy will ever like me.      I know some arragend marriages work out but in alot of them, the adults fight and they make the kids miserable.       Why do people have arranged marriages?, isnt the whole point of marriage to be with someone you LOVE forever?      How can I escape getting an arranged marriage?

20090222161242AANWixs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this dude want??? Should I keep talking to him?	This guy that I've known for almost five years calls me. To give a little of our background, we were just sleeping together and then I quit when I found out he had a girlfriend. Then I cut him off and didn't really keep in touch with him (we called each other every now and then). Then we started back talking at the beginning of this year and we ended up sleeping together one time, but then I told him I didn't want to continue in a sexual relationship as I didn't want to get hurt again. He was ok with that. Not that I want him to stop calling me, I just want to know what he wants. How could I tell without asking him?? He calls before he goes to sleep about 2-3 times a week, and since we go to the same school he always waits around for me to see if he'll see me. He hasn't asked me on a date or anything though and he hasn't asked me for sex, so what could it be????

20090222161308AAmTS3i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I be a better girlfriend? :-(?	I love my boyfriend so much, we have lived together for 14 months now, I'm 19 he is 25, I have adopted his son who is 4 from a previous relationship and I am a proud mummy now too. I do everything for them both. But  he makes me feel so stupid sometimes, sometimes I  feel like I stress him out so much, he isn't very open with his feelings and doesn't like to talk about things, I am a very open person and need to know I'm apreciated and cared about. it causes so many arguments and stress for me that I just don't know what to do any   More, I try to explain my feelings sometimes and he just says I don't wanna talk about it. It hurts me and he is pushing me away and I'm scared because of our son. All I want is for us to live peacefully but I know it won't happen unless I try to just shut up and get on with it. How do I turn feelings that I'm useless into positive things. I need any advice. Anything to help me get some inner peace at least. I know this all sounds a bit confusing, I'm tired and emotional. :) sorry. X x

20090222161200AAboSeL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I convince my husband to kick his son out?	Here's the scoop.  My husband of one year has a 34 year old son who is a Meth addict.  He's currently homeless.  No job.  Kicked out of the military.  My husband feels sorry for his son's homelessness and so informs me that he's bringing him home to stay with us for a few months.  He's skinny as a rail, unclean, unshaven, and has track marks on his hand and up his arm from shooting up (fresh marks). I told my husband it wouldn't work out for his son because he's basically a street person and that's his lifestyle.  I told him that his son has to shower every night before bed. (He's been here for a week and has showered once.)  He's eating us out of house and home!  He helps himself to all the groceries and is doing nothing in return but staying in our guest bedroom and sleeping all day and night.  The bedroom looks like a bomb went off in there.  My husband gave him money for a haircut and also for cigarettes.  I don't trust the guy and only see him as a parasite using his father's good will.  None of his other family members want him around including his mother.  How do I convince my husband of one year that this isn't going to work?  I fear for our marriage?

Then they end up scaring the hell out of him.

20090222161334AApUjQq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Lose carrer? (10 points for best answer. answers)?	Last summer my friend Penny(16 at the time) went off to Spain with her family. While there she met a 20 year old girl named Carrie and the two ended up dating for the summer and Penny lost her virginity to Carrie. Then school started,Penny's junior year, and it turns out that Penny's new student teacher for English class is Carrie. Carrie told Penny that nothing else could happen because shes her teacher now, but she eventually gave in. If they get caught could Carrie lose her teaching license? Do you think the whole situation is messed up?

20090222161224AA82xwK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We're taking a relationship break for a week or two; what do we do in the meantime?	We've hit a stressful time. We seem to do nothing but argue, and his parents are treating him like he's twelve again. Contrary to popular belief, it seems, he is twenty and I feel that he needs to find the balance between our relationship and his relationship with his parents.      I proposed a small break. Just so we can talk without the complications of the relationship title, and maybe he'll feel safer telling me things that he otherwise wouldn't.      But what are we supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?   I don't know how you go about with the self discovery and relationship patching.      I love him very much, and he loves me, but I feel like this may be the last ditch effort to save our relationship. If we can't get it right this time, we may never untwist the problems.

20090222161751AAk0Oq1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WTH HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok, so there's this guy that I hang out with in my group of friends. We all hang out because we are all in speech. So whenever I see him, he makes all these sexual jokes like he wants to screw me, ect. I'm kind of known as the flirt in the group, but I don't have a boyfriend. I'm kind of the boyish girl in the group. But I definetly don't dress boyish, just act like some of the guys. So, he and I get along great, but he is in a little bit of the popular crowd at school, and I'm just average. He acts different around some people. Like at school he doesn't really flirt with me. But he always like touches me. But like last night, I had onions for dinner (I know I'm an ***) and he was like your breath smells bad, and he and I kind of banter back and forth. He also sometimes touches me like he like put his arm around me for like 1 minutes last night and was like massaging my shoulder, and like always steps on my heels in a joking way. Only 1 person I know says he likes me, because no one knows I like him, and I don't ask.I have no idea if I'm pretty or not, some of my girlfriends say I'm gorgoes, but then again they are friends. Haha so only a couple of guys and like adults and my friends say I'm pretty. He's a but of a flirt too, and it's wierd because right when he and I got tight, his gf and him broke up. I'm like outgoing and so is he. So what do you think, do you think he likes me? By the way we are both in high school. But we are like kind of hot and cold. Like sometimes at school, we hardly even talk but when we are out we are like super tight. What do you think-does he like me?

(hes popular, and im normal but pretty) so we dont run in the same groups. and he then moved and said srry, in a not srry way, and he asked me my name and that was it that day. then another day he said something to me, and again i thought he was picking on me.. so i said to him "whats ur name again" and he said "am i really that unimportant to u that u dont know my name?" i dont know if he was just playing with me when he said that tho. AND then another day when i think he thought i wouldnt hear he told his friend that "the only thing that makes me sad is claire." *claires me*   i then looked over at his friend then him, and he was just like "ohh" when he saw that i heard. So what does all this mean? does he like me? cause i kinda like him, i just dont c him much anymore...

She filed for Alimony, they were married for 8 years but they had been together for almost 10plus years, she did work at first but lost her job at the beginning of their marriage. They don't have a prenup and I wont say how much he makes but it is millions since they have been married. He never likes to talk about this with me and I dont pry because I let him handle this with his ex and their lawyers but I am curious as to how much she will actually get?

He is shy and earlier this week he was at the volleyball game and i saw him there. we weren't talking to each other and we were keeping our distance. I was looking at him, and he turned around and notice i was looking at me. When He saw me looking at him, he turned around looking shy. Then, me and my friends left the gym and went to the cafeteria. His friends came a little after we did..? So anyways.. He saw me, acting like he didn't. then he kept looking at me, and i was looking at him. When we saw each other we turned our heads back around and talked with our friends. He looks at me if I am talking with my friends. But when I talk to his friends or look at his friends when they are talking, he acts like he is out of the conversation. problem: hes in 7th and i am in 8th. help please?

Hey everyone, I've been getting really close to this girl over the last few months, we talk practically everyday and she seems very attracted to me. However, she has never had a boyfriend and she is known as a very outgoing girl. At first, I didn't take her very seriously and I kind of turned down her requests to hang out and stuff but I have become really attracted it to her and I want to start hanging out and start a relationship. The only problem is, as I've show more interest for her, she has kind of closed the door a little. For example, if I hint to her that I want to hang out she seems more hesitant and a little reluctant. Does she just want to be friends, does she actually like me or is she just playing games?

Its been three days, and he still hasn't called. Did he just use me, even thought thats not who he is according to all of our mutual friends?
20090222153158AA1iNfX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are your opinions on young love?	If you don't know what I mean by young love... I mean kids who are getting into relationships that are under the age of 15.       Do you think that it is their choice and they should have a relationship if they wanted to? Or, do you think that they are too young?  Does it matter as long as you are in love?      Of course the chances of heartbreak may be higher... but you can get heartbroken at any age. I'm age 13 and a lot of my friends are going out with guys already and getting their first kiss... blahblah... I don't mind but their parents don't know... and they think their parents would kill them.

20090222122258AAnWQtY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Have you ever had a friend who was 'magical'?	I don't mean like wizards. Have you ever had a friend who performed random acts of kindness, who could make friends with anyone, and who was a truly good person? Who things just seemed to happen to? Kind of like the ex-boyfriend in That Summer, or Stargirl in Stargirl, if you have read those books.
20090222105659AAuUVP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I write him a little message?	Here's the story:   In December 2007, I met someone on the Internet and we talked a lot about "serious" stuff like politics, economics and such. He wanted to be a politician and my fields of studies was related to that so I really liked talking (writing messages) about that with him. We both knew what we looked like because we'd seen pictures. However, he was the classy kind and I, at the time, was more hippy-ish. When we met at the end of December, I wore jeans with a hole in them and a grunge-looking jacket. We haven't seen each other since. I know one of the reasons was the clothes I was wearing (It may sound superficial but I understand him about that).      I wrote him a message in June 2008 asking him if I should do smtg we had talked about, back in the day when we did talk. He didn't answer anything.      Yesterday, I went to the movies with a friend. And then I saw him. My heart started speeding up so I didn't want to say hi cuz I knew my voice would be high-pitch lol. So I just passed by and take magazines beside the place where he was standing but without looking at him. Then I turned around and talked to my friend. She said that the guy stared at me when I got closer to him to get the magazines. That he stared at me from the top to the bottom. As if he was waiting for me to say hi. (but I never made eye-contact with him so he could prolly think i just didnt see him. but he did, i know that for a fact. heh.)      Now I'm wondering... Should I send him a message asking him like were you at the movies yesterday i think i saw you blablabla... Or should I just not? If HE didn't say hi (even tho he saw me), should I just not bother sending him that little message?      Taking into account how it ended in December 2007. And the msg he ignored in April 2008.      I hope those who answer this have read the whole text...      Thanks!

20090222103201AABK40T	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please give me advice on my situation!?	Okay so this has been an ongoing situation since I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. From the start my parents never liked or accepted him as my boyfriend. We've been living together for a year now. Every time I go visit them or hang out they lecture me about him and the way we live. I came from a spoiled family and am now living in I guess what you call lower class. They lecture me about everything. But I have 2 cousins. One already had 2 kids before marriage and did drugs and all of that and the other is pregnant before marriage. They don't look at them and all. My brother even says crap to me. Me and my boyfriend just came back from spending a few days a my grandparents for the first time. They like him and respect him! They support us more then my parents do! My grandma says that she even hates the things my mom says about my. Me and my boyfriend even talked about us getting married by Justice of the Peace so I can go back to college for free. My boyfriend supports me and we always think about out future. He wants me to go back to college and get married soon. But it seems like my parents don't care. Im almost 20 and my brother is almost 18. He's going to college in a few months. They should be focusing more on him then me. And they always want me to come back home. It's really sad that my grandparents support us more then my parents. It's so aggravating!   So can you please give me advice on everything and advice on the Justice of the Peace marriage?

20090222133815AAp1e5q	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help - Messed up relationship! Am I making the right decision?	Well, I have been in this relationship a little more than 3 yrs. We do not have kids together. I have been through hell and back again. He had a slight drug and major ahlcohol problem. He stopped the weed smoking completly, but he continues to drink beer. He drinks from 12noon to late at night. However, in the past he was drinking sun up to sun down, just as long as he wanted to drink that day. Don't get me wrong he had his days where he is completly clean. But, who want to see someone live like that. Not only that, we went through the abusive stuff too, where we were fighting. Now I am at a point where, I just am sick and tired of his stuff. I tried everything from going to AA/Ca/NA  programs to Sunday service with him. This morning I decied to throw in the towel. I am offically fed up. I found him leaving the house this Sunday moring at 8:30 am. He has no job right now. I heard from his friend that he was at a "hang out, smoke house". So I drive by. He is coming out of the house smelling like smoke and Gin and carring a beer in his hand unopened. So, I waited for him to come home for Sunday service, and only to find him coming out of a smoke house?    Is God trying to punish me. Why can't I have a regular relationship like everyone else?  I have to work this hard for love. If that is the case, then I am washing my hands clean.     In the past I posted a similar question, but peopl to me to try and hang out and he will eventually work stop. He needs support, blah blah. Now this is effecting me.    What now? If I wanted to leave today with little or no money how do I get out, and how without him knowing?

20090222154609AA4wQI0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told a girl I dont know that I liked her over the Internet (MOST STUPID THING I KNOW :P)?	Yes it was very stupid I know.      She replied and said it creeped her out a bit but she seemed happy enough to reply.       Were at different schools and Ive seen her on the bus a few times so she would probably recognise me.      I'm not sure if she knew who I was when I sent the message.      She replied and said it creeped her out a bit.      Back to school on Tuesday so if I see her do you think I should say it was me that sent the message, or should I not say and just start speaking to her (knowing that she could easily recognise me from my profile picture)?      Confidence and stuff isn't an issue, it's a long story why I did it over the Internet      Thanks

20090222114728AABPJli	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he know he's been making me horny?	my guy friend who is also my ex-boyfriend has been making me horny lately and making me "want" him really bad. one time he told me he has the balls i'll never get from anyone because i told him he was scared and didnt have the balls to try some sport. he said he would show me. he also talked about how his dick is big and how everything people said about it is true. now that made me go insane and now he's got me thinking about his dick. he also calls me hot and says "your welcome my lady" and flirts with me. when we were texting he asked me "what do you wear and watch when you're alone?" he also is rude and cocky sometimes which really turns me on for some odd reson. he never said or did stuff like this to me before. he's making me really really want him but my friends keep saying i shouldnt be with him because he's bad. he asked me to be friends with benefits.    i'm just wondering if he knows that he's doing this to me. he is like a big perv and everyone says that but he won't admit to me that he is so sometimes he seems clueless but i dont know if it's an act or something.   what should i do before i end up saying or doing something i might regret? this is starting to get bad.
20090222110504AABZ4lu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bartender that has a crush on me?	So last night i went to the bar with my friend, it's the bar we always go to but tonight there was a different guy working.   we talked to him a little bit but not an unusual amount he's pretty cool as a bartender and stuff. when we were leaving he was asking us about where we were going and he was like oh you should come over and like gave me his number.  and he kept telling me to call him and gave me a hug and stuff.   so like he seems like a cool guy but i'm not down with his type. i mean he's like a 30 year old bartender working at a college bar. i assume that anyone who i'd be involved with who was 30 (which i wouldn't it's way to old) is like done with college and makes probably 80k a year. not in a greedy way, i just need people who have stability in their life.      so anyhow now i'm too embarassed to go back to this bar. i'm definitely not going to call this guy.      maybe it's not that big of a deal... lol      i just want creepy guys to stop hitting on me. help.
20090222131058AAs4Rxb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's ok for a guy to use you for your body as long as he is good looking right?	WARNING: I KNOW THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL WOMEN, JUST SOME!!!!!      Some women complain about how men only want sex and what not and set up rules for how long they will wait to do it with a guy but will jump in bed any good looking guy within a short amount of time. Then have nerve to get mad at some guys when they try underhanded techniques to get into their pants.      It's dumb, my cousin came down her once and talked to a girl who wanted to do it with him, but then he tried to do it with that girl's cousin and she found out about it and got mad at him and stopped talking to him. He came down here two days ago, and just yesterday after months of not talking to her or seeing him she had sex with him.....Wow.      My question is, if I am not fortunate to be born good looking (which I wasn't) I should have NO sex drive right? Because apparently you can only lie to girls and cheat and act like a player if you are good looking. Isn't that right women?         Stay Cool            Kaine

I thought to myself, wow, hes really cool, I would love to hear what he has to say about some other issues. Soo, I added him on myspace, sending him a message and asking what he thought about something.       He hasnt responded, and its been almost a week. He has been online, and has been commenting other people, ect. What I dont understand is why he hasnt responded to me... If he doesnt want to talk to people he doesnt know... then why did he add me?       On top of that, Im certainly not ugly and im a  little younger than him so its not like Im some creeper he just doesnt want to talk to.....      What do you think?

20090222125906AAOuzke	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Should I Say/Do About This?	There's this girl I used to be best friends with, but I stopped talking to her cause I think she's a *****. She's always talking crap about me to my boyfriend, and it gets me annoyed that she's talking badly about me to MY boyfriend. I told him how frustrated it makes me to know that they talk, and he gave me advice saying "Oh, just lose all contact with her. Block her, don't talk to her."   So today is my birthday, and I get a phone call from her, so I was wondered what she wanted, and I picked up. I figured she was just trying to be nice and wish me a happy birthday, ok, it's not like I'm having a conversation with her, no big deal. Which she did, all she said was "Happy birthday." So I thanked her and hung up.      She just told my boyfriend "I spoke to her on the phone, she sounded like a man." Now my boyfriends pissed at me because I ignored his advice, and enabled her to contact me. He was like "Wtf, does my advice go through one ear and out the other? I care so much, that I don't want you to have any problems, big or small, cause small things can build up, so what's the point of me wasting my breath trying to help you, if you're just gonna ignore what I tell you? Whatever, you want me to care less? Fine, wish granted. I'm not gonna offer you advice unless you desperatley need it."      He's also upset because he's already really mad about work, and this situation is just making it worse.      Wtf, what should I say/do?

20090222110343AAH0h8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Do I Do About This Creepy Guy, Short?	I've known this guy for a week solid. I met him at a party and was a little overly friendly because I was a bit tipsy. I didn't do anything inappropriate with him though.      This guy called me last night and asked me what was wrong, why I was acting like such a b*tch to him. I do admit I did send out mixed signals -- but that was because I was drunk. I saw him last night at another party and he came up to me and said: "We need to talk."      I acted like I didn't hear what he had to say and walked away. I do feel like a b*tch but he creeps me out a lot. I was with other girl friends and they said the same thing.      Advice!? I don't want to be mean to him but I think he gets the wrong idea. UGH WHAT TO DO?

20090222121429AA07nkd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just give up?	I just went on a cruise, and met a girl who I hooked up with.  I really would like to follow up in a relationship with her, but she said she wanted to just stay friends with me because she has a boyfriend back home.  But I mean, she must have some feelings towards me if she was willing to cheat (completely sober).  I was wondering, should i just give up on her, because I don't really want to just settle as friends.. she lives close enough for us to visit each other, but I don't know what I should do.  Please don't say there are plenty of fish in the sea and I should give up because I only knew her for a week.. I want real answers because I'm really upset about this.
20090222124740AAJXY9L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I dump Him? Men YOUR OPINION MATTERS!?	My BF & I have been having some up & downs lately. Last night he thought it would be funny to tell he had sex with another women to get a reaction out of me. Obviuosly it worked. I reacted very badly and he's lucky I didn't dump him.. I wrote him the note below to let him know how I'm feeling. He's a Spanish man & everything is about respect. I don't want it to sound like I'm bashing him or putting him down. Just that I need things to change for me to stay in this relationship.       BRUTAL Honesty Appreciated.       Today, I've been thinking about our relationship. I think I finally realize you don't feel the same way about me as I do for you. I don't understand why. I've seen the letters you wrote to Stephanie and it was full of " I love you" & "I miss you" I would give anything for your to write me a note like that. Or kiss me & tell me you love me.. From what I can gather, she played hard to get. She made you work for it. Basically exactly what you do to me. I'm very open. If I love you, I want you to know I do. It is pointless to play games. Games hurt people.       I've been debating whether or not to stay in our relationship or to break things off and attempt to be friends with you. Just because we're having a baby together doesn't mean we have to be a couple. I want to be with a man who smiles when he thinks of me. Who is excited to be with me. I'm excited to spend time with you. I smile when I think about you. I have a life of my own, I just enjoy making room in my life for you. Just when I think I've had all I can take (example last night) then you do something that makes me love you even more. You smiled when you saw me next to you this morning. You hold me all night. One minute I think you love me, the next it feels like you can't wait to get away from me. I don't understand the constant up & down.       Please don't misunderstand me. I think you are great guy. If I didn't think that I wouldn't allow you to be in my life. You do A LOT of little things for me that make me incredibly happy. I know you care about me, but I believe that you are not in love with me.. That's really hard to accept.       I promised you I would always be open and honest with you.. This is what has been going on in my mind.       P.S We're 28 & 30 We've been dating for 16months.

20090222110455AA3uga2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is love necessary for a healthy life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.
20090222120748AAtLFB6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What 'might' be going on in his mind?..if anything at all?	The guy who i like ALOT moved to a different state a month ago. I dont know if he likes me or not because he replies to all my emails but he is kind of private and rarely talks about his personal self. he talks about everything else in the world BUT himself. He does flirt time to time but not all the time or very often.       So in order to see how he would react, i randomly told him about this other guy who likes me alot....of course i dont like him back but i just wanted to see what he would say and react to it. I mentioned about this guy who likes me in an email that i sent him(we usually communicate through emails).....when i did receive his reply, he said NOTHING about the guy who likes me....like he spoke about everything else....the email was long...but didn't even mention his name or said anything about him.....what is this suppose to mean?....whats going on with him?      (oh and if you want to tell me that i should not try to working anything out online, please dont bother answering...he visits this state often so i can work this out if i want...)

20090222131724AACrJvP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Isnt it weird if you're 20 something  you dont have a bf?	Sorry if it sounded rude in any way.      Its just that I have two close friends. Both 21 turning 22 soon. They never told me if they liked any guys in hs or college. Never sounded curious. DOES NOT SEEM LIKE LESBIANS we are close buds in our group of (girl) friends and were were friends since hs junior yr and pretty much the ppl I hangout with.       One of em told me she hasnt like a guy in 6th. It such a lie and its sounded like she was too shy to tell me.       For the other girl I dont think shes gay cuz she wrote on her myspace one time about finding mr. right. but shes definitely not putting  herself out there enough for guys to notice her.      Yes I am worried about them in a weird way. Btw, how do lesbians act around you maybe cuz I dont know any lesbians and I cant tell for girls. I have gay guy friends only.

Do you think he's ashamed of me?   Because everytime our friends came over, he'd ignore me completely.
20090222111218AAU94wc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend getting Booty Calls AFTER our dates ? Weird clues ?	IDK i feel in my gut that something is up with my boyfriend   on valentine;s night he said he felt sick and offered to drive me home at 9:30 pm after dinner   i said no i would take care of him   next day he was suddenly better   then this saturday he took me to dinner, we watched a movie, made out and then he suddenly announced he would drive me home at 11pm   he said since he is selling his house , he has a 9 am showing to wake up for.. i live 15 minutes away and dont have car, he did joke tonight he/we should buy me a car.      Anyway, I was all ready to stay and please him and make out more.   he was telling me Im so hot and sexy and he adores me and then boom decides to drive me home...      since he had been sick the week before it had been nearly two weeks since we REALLY made out.      am i being paranoid ?   Im just sitting here feeling like the night ended too early.   he is 40 and played catch with his son all afternoon, he kept yawning that he was sorry he was tired.   im 31 and look and fele young and have so much energy.   is he just older and thats why its normal for him to turn in early for bed ?          * 14 hours ago   update*******   i first posted this last night   he never called me when he was supposed to get home at 1130 pm (i asked him to)   he emailed me at 9 am today that he was awake and rushing to get out of the house for the showing...(huh he is usually up at 6-7 am and wanted to drop me home early, why was he rushed for time at 9 am?)   he then called me at 11 am and said he had decided to start wokring out hardcore again for first time in years....   Hmmm.... He then joked so i dont leave him for my exbf (im still great friends with my exbf)           and I should add we usually have always stayed out or seen other until 2 or 3 am.   he has acted differently since he went out on a tuesday night 2 weeks ago with someone he called a 'friend' and also one thing he never did before was take calls during dinner and step outside.   he says theyre business contacts but seems strange on a saturday night.      thoughts ???
20090222124606AA6blBe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know its long but please help me?	ive been with this guy on and off for two yearss. we know so much about eachother and have been through soo much together. in the beggining of december we ended things cause it got too hard. (the only reason we end things is when too much is going on it our lives or distnace reasons) hes the type of guy that runs away from his problems so to get him to talk about it i came off very pushy.       i gave him his space until new years when he saw i was with another guy and flipped. we got in the biggest fight EVER. said a lot of things we didnt mean and told eachother to stay out of our lives. once again i came off very pushy and needy. i know immature and terrible of me i know.       i gave him his space since then and didnt talk to him since. a few nights ago at a party one of his friends was trying to get with me. i said no because its wrong of both of us to do that. he wouldnt take no for an answer and he texted my ex and asked if it was okay and he didnt answer which right there shows he wasnt okay with it he was just in a bad position to answer. he finally answered the phone and when he asked hte question my ex went dead on the phone and was just like uhhhhhhh and hung up. his friend kept telling me that my ex hated me and has a new girl and all this mean stuff which in my opinion was all lies just to get me to hook up with him but im not sure. if my ex had a new girl i dont think he wouldve hesitated on the phone so i really dont know.      i texted my ex and told him i needed to talk to him but he had school the next day and was already asleep. i said i respect you want no part of me i jsut want to tell you something. (i was going to explain what happend cause i didnt want him to think i actually hooked up with his friend) well he texted me back the next day and said sorry i fell asleep.       then that night i find out he almost faught some kid that talks to me because we talk and told him to stop talking to me and if we ever went out he would make his life hell and stuff.       all this is so random to me cause i thought he really did hate me.    im so confused and i really dont know what to think or whats going on.   do you think he still loves me and cares about me? i know i still need to give him his space and im not sure if we're both ready to be talkng again, i just miss him so much.

20090222122913AA9QrHw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hate being jealous....?	I'm dating the perfect guy. We are best friends, soul mates, destined, the whole nine yards. I'm jealous of his past and I can't stop. I know I need to or else the worse will happen.   He has an ex-wife with whom he shares a child. He sees her and talks to her frequently (and not just about the child). This past December I found text messages in his phone where he and she were dirty texting back and forth. I asked him about it and he said he was trying to "mess with her mind" which he tries to do frequently. They constantly fight as well.   I found that lately, the decisions in my life have been affected by this woman. For instance....I've wanted a tattoo since forever but have been too scared. I got the nerve up and found out "she" had one so I decided not to get one. I told him I didn't want to be like her. Little stupid things like that. Am I trying too hard to make him not be a part of her life more than just with the kid? Do I seem like a B*&^%? How do I stop this insanity? Maybe I'm just afraid to lose him?

20090222105953AAWT8J2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she jealous if she rejected me?	I dated a girl once and she rejected me the second time around. Said we should "just be friends". I didn't talk to her for a week or two and the other night at a party she approached me and poked me. I've dealt with hot/cold girls before and I thought I knew where this was heading, so I said hi back and went somewhere else before any convo started.      Later that night I danced with and hooked up with another girl. I noticed the girl I dated was hovering around us on the dance floor and she shot me a very angry stare. Ever since that night every time I see the girl I dated, she stares at me and then looks down on the floor. She looks at me alot as a matter of fact.      So I asked her to hang out with me and some friends yesterday and she never texted me back. What's the best way to deal with this girl, and does anyone think she's a psycho?

20090222114824AAVOaHy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused. What is she thinking?	So, I asked this girl out this weekend to ice skating. She texted me asking if it was a date or just hanging out. I told her it can be whatever she wants it to be.      We go skating, and then we start watching a movie at her place. I was hesitant, because she didn't really indicate which it was, so I was unsure whether to make a move or not.      Anyway, we end up talking for like 4 hours after the movie. She even decided not to go hang out with her friend from work. However, I got the impression she wasn't wanting to date at the moment (she got out of a long term relationship about a month and a half ago).      Any thoughts or advice?

This is long so I tried my best to shorten it      …me & my guy friend have our ups and downs    …started developing feelings over the years    …turned into something way deeper.    …think he may not want to ruin the friendship by getting into a relationship.       …Life is short    …we known each other for almost 4 years   …still just friends.    …Reallllly close friends.    …confused    …he said the L word and I couldn’t say anything back...    …because I felt he never saw me like that    …I mean were just friends right?    …wasn’t a friendly love ya either.    ...don’t understand    ...he said it and he still doesn’t show it.    ...We are still just friends.   ...he’s slowly showing it    ...but life is short    ...tried the moving on so many times    ...doesn’t even work anymore.    ...I have tried many times to talk to him.    ...I mean reallly talk to him. I almost give up.      I’m a strong woman but sometimes I get upset and it hurts. But he’s never ever seen my pain.       So with reading my summary here are my questions.      1. If he saw my pain would he come around? I don’t have forever      2. Is it a good idea to hang out with him and hopefully get through to him?      so..... What should I do???

20090222130437AAFTPAJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help - 10 points best most insightful answer?	i have a very complicated relationship w/a guy for over a year now. i can't commit fully and he has issues of his own. He called me last night and we talked for over 3 hours. At one point in the conversation he said "I love you, have I told you lately that I love you" after that he mentioned how lately he knows when he texts me or responds to my text that he is cold and that he could take the extra few seconds to add something sweet.       That my messages touch his heart and motivate his day and it makes him feel bad that he doesn't return with the same kindness but that he is holding back so he doesn't confuse me or himself further. Than he asked "should I say those things to you I mean for some reason it makes me feel uncomfortable I do feel those nice sweet things but now for some reason feel uncomfortable to say them...do you think i should say them?"       I told him that he should do whatever makes him feel comfortable. I am so confused as to what he meant and why he would say this. I tried to ask but he didn't really want to get into it further....what do you make of what he said to me??

20090222113145AAbjUf8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you conclude if your boyfriend doesn't call you enough?	Your boyfriend goes for a 10 day visit to parents (one of them is recovered from a recent MI and an operation after that). Parents don't know about you as a girlfriend. If he call you only twice and all of your phone conversation including those you called is not more than 15 minutes in 10 days what would you think? his excuse is that he is not able to find private time to call you. keep in mind that you both are sending short emails everyday and the fact that just before the trip he used to call you almost 3 hours a day.

20090222114539AATb4WQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, if you went out the door in the morning with only washing your hair?	No makeup of any kind, just make sure your hair is washed and your teeth brushed and your face clean.    Many start the day out that way but how many can say that they would be confident with their looks walking off to work or school with zero hair products or makeup or mascara of any kind?
20090222123952AAPRLFh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a relationship question?	I've been dating this guy for seven months, but I only saw him once and that was the day we met. He said he would make time to see me once he fixed his car, but his car is still running badly. So we talked like three times a day. I got so sick of it so I told him I didn't want to start dating until he got his stuff together. He agreed, but I'm missing him.  I don't even know how long it will take for him to get his stuff together. The reason why I didn't want to keep dating him is because I didn't want to be held down and never see him.  What should I do? Do I wait for him to get his stuff together or should I just forget about him? Thanks!!

20090222125739AAQqpCw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a hard time saying "no" to this guy even though he's been a dick to me. Can you help me toughen up?!?	So I like/liked this guy...I'm mostly over him in the romantic likey-likey sense, but I still like hanging out with him and being his friend.   Now I feel like he's taking advantage of me and using me a little bit, because he knows that I like him; but the thing is, what he's doing could still be seen as just a friend asking a favor.      After being a dick to me (see rant below), he calls me up and asks me a small favor: Get a school directory so he can offer jobs to people at my school. It's a small thing, yeah, but the way he asked me about it made me feel like he was just taking advantage of the fact that I like/liked him, and the fact that I probably won't say no to him because of those feelings. I've gone off him since finding out about his wild night with our female friend, so I didn't WANT to just go ahead and do the favor, so I sort of dodged a bit and said 'I'll try but I don't think I can do it.'    HELP ME GIRLS, how can I toughen up against him and be able to refuse him?? I don't want him walking all over me or my heart any more than he already has!      ________________________________   The rant, which explains all:   At the end of 2008, I thought we were going somewhere - we'd kissed, talked a lot online and a surprising amount on the phone (neither of us seem to be big phone talkers). Then on New Years, when he was at my house for a party, we made out and I asked him "What are we?", to which he gave the shitty answer of "You're an awesome friend but I don't know - I'm up for friends with benefits though."   So we talked about relationships and the possibility of "us" a few days later. We had differing ideas on what we define a relationship as and what we wanted from each other, so we decided to take it easy 'n slow and figure things out as they came up. I figured I could convince him that a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship wasn't all that bad as time went on.       A month passes, its the start of February, and i see him flirting with a female friend that I sort of introduced to him. I find out from another friend that the guy I like and the female friend most likely had sex, despite the fact that they both knew that I like him AND despite the fact that the two of us had decided we'd talk about the possibility of other people coming into the relationship (whether we wanted open relationship or single-person-commitment)....Without knowing they [probably] had sex, I call him up a few days after I saw the two flirting, I called him and asked if he saw the two of us becoming anything. He said no, we hung up, and I got over it surprisingly quickly - I think I just needed to be told that "No nothing's going to happen", that I needed the finality and closure of it. Compared to how I used to think about him everyday, I've barely thought about him in the two weeks since I got my closure, so I feel like I'm mostly over him.

20090222111045AAFFSr3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is lack of fitness good enough reason for a deal-killer?	Being active and able to move around is an important part of my lifestyle.  I was on a date with a very nice lady.  The fact that she is overweight doesn't bother me much.  The fact that, at a very leisurely pace, she couldn't manage 7 flights of stairs, is.   How can you give birth if you can't manage 7 flights of stairs slowly?   How can you be there to teach your kid to ride a bike when you can't run alongside?   How can you reasonably expect 20 years from now to not lose your feet to amputation and be in a wheelchair because you got diabetic from lack of activity and poor diet?   In other words, folks, am I shallow for not giving her a future, when I am looking at her lifestyle and concluding she doesn't add up to it for me?  Forgetting how she looks (definitely not eye candy), and she is nice, and intelligent, and all, but, am I allowed to "write her off" the dating list because she is just so out-of-shape for a woman in her 20's?      I am not about to try to get her to change her lifestyle or who she is to accomodate my wishes.  If a reasonable level of activity and fitness are not part of her lifestyle now, I am not going to be successful in prodding her into doing something she's not already motivated to do.  You put that answer in here and I'm putting your answer in the "stupid bin".

20090222130707AALDyRo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do with this situation?	I normally would never post something like this, but I am totally and completely lost on what to do.   I'm a freshman, and I liked this boy who didn't go to my school. He's a senior. Let's call him boy A. We talked a lot and he asked me out. So we went out to a movie, then he took me to this nice neighborhood he used to work in. I know this sounds really odd, but it was the right thing for us. And we talk really easily then he kissed me. And I was euphoric. I had never experienced feelings like this for anyone before. It was an insane sense of perfection. So we continued talking and making plans for the next weekend because he was leaving on a trip the next week. All I could think about was how much I was going to miss him. Then the tuesday after we went out, he called me and said that what we were doing wasn't right. That he hadn't been a gentleman when he took me out. That we had to stop whatever was going on between us. I was totally devastated. It was such a shock to me, I thought he liked me too.    The next night, a boy that goes to my school asked me out. And he's a nice guy, but I said no because I was heartbroken about boy A. Then we continued to talk and sometimes I was able to forget about boy A. Then he asked me out again and I considered saying yes because it might help me get over boy A. I flipped back and forth between yes and no because    1) I was definitely not over boy A. I was in such pain.   2) I didn't like boy B nearly as much.   I asked my friends for advice, but everyone was as stuck as I was.   Do I use boy B to get over boy A?   But then, the night before boy A was to leave the country, he took me home from an event and we sat and talked just like before he had broke things off. When I pulled away from giving him a goodbye hug, he kept his hand on my lower back. I felt weird because I still obviously liked him so much and this was definitely not a sign of just friends. Then later that night, boy A texted me and told him how much he was going to miss me and how he wished he could just see him one more time before he left. Then of course, the next morning he left. There is no communication possible because he is in a third world country. Boy B continued to ask me to make a choice about dating. If boy A hadn't been in the picture, it would have been an automatic yes. But if I dated boy B, when I was with boy A, I would feel almost like I was cheating on him. Is it fair to boy B to have feelings for someone else and still date?   Any suggestions on what to do? Luckily, boy A returns home in a week, so I can see him soon, but boy B wants a decision which I don't blame him. He told me he wants all of me or nothing.
20090222115520AA2UBsX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I say to my ex boyfriend?	This is a long story, but I'll shorten it up for you:   My ex boyfriend is 17, and I'm 15. He was my first boyfriend and he was a really nice guy, so we started going out, nothing serious, for about a month. But, I started getting this awful feeling every time I thought about "us". When I'm with him my anxiety gets a lot worse. I dont know why. It's NOT because I dont trust him. It's NOT because I'm away from him. I'm not sure why it happens, but I couldn't change it. I broke up with him saying we should just b friends, because I thought that would help my anxiety b/c it was getting really unhealthy. It got much better once we were friends. But, I always feel attracted to him still. I always want to kiss him but I know if I do he'll think I want to go out with him again and then my anxiety will come back. Anyways, he told me he wanted to talk to me, and my Friend said he told her he was going to ask me out again. He's one of my best friends but I dont think I want to go out with him again because I feel terrible when i do. Like everybody is watching me or I'm different to my family now that I have a boyfriend. Anyways, whatshouldI say to him?

20090222131937AAjT7J2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	ARGH! I feel like my fiance is totally detatched from reality, advice please?!?	My fiance of 2 years is in a local band, and they do very very well in the town that we live in and also in London too. However, as much as I support him and his music, Im starting to get really annoyed at the way in which he is 100 percent convinced his band are gonna make it big time. He doesnt have a plan B for his life and that scares me. It isnt helping that his mother fuels this belief that his band are gonna be the next big thing and that he doesnt need to do anything else. H barely works and all he thinks about is his band, it comes before everything, me included. What do I do? Maybe im just being really cynical and negative, but I just feel he needs to get a grip on reality. How do I apporach this with him without hurting his feelings or  his ego?

However, during those times, he doesn't seem to help me come, and when he comes, we just stop having sex. He's so awsome in bed, but doesn't seem to know whether I came or not, or assumes that I do because I also love the sex so much and the way he performs.      I'm really shy to ask him to help me come. What do you think I should do or say to him? THanks! :)

He confessed everything he loves about me he even told me how i make him feel and i was surprised. He buys me anything i want even though i tell him not to. because im not a gold digger. lol. He said he would take a bullet for me. And he don't just speak the words he shows action so i know he is not lying. I love him deeply and i would do anything for our relationship to last and we grow old together but i was just wondering how far would a guy go to confess his love for his girl.

20090222132231AAUjg7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?! Please help me?	Ok. So I like Myles.   We have one class together, band. He plays trumpet and I play clarinet.   And today Myles saw a bit of another side of me... Normally I'm insanely quiet and stuff, unless I'm with my friends. So today, I was talking to my best friend across the music room. She said 'oh so Amanda, I got a 100 on my math quiz!' and I was like 'oh wow, that's amazing' because that isn't really normal for her at all... But anyway, so then I said 'so I still haven't finished reading the stuff' (for English which was the next class we had) and she said 'oh my God, still?' and I said that I only have a page left to read and I'd finish it soon. Then she came over to me, and explained the last page to me though I'd read sparknotes and finished it two minutes later, but throughout that part where my friend and I were talking across the room, Myles was there and I think he was listening a bit, and he seemed to have a bit of a smile/smirk on his face. That's like the first time that I've been like that near him.   We've talked on facebook a bit.    And he knows that I like him. He was actually the one to originally say hello the first time we talked. Our first conversation was:   Myles: hello   Me: hey   *he got off, and about an hour and a half later*   Me: hey, um, i have a quick question..   Myles: yah sure what is it   Me: whyd you say hello to me earlier   Myles: i dont know   Myles: maybe i felt like it at the time   Myles: should i not say hello to you anymore   Me: no   Me: i was just wondering.. it just seemed.. kinda random   Myles: ahh i see   And three of my friends know that I like Myles... And when I told one of them, my best guy friend, I told him about that conversation, and he said that by Myles saying hello, he was putting himself out there... And that was about it.   Our most recent conversation (Wednesday night) went like this:   Me: heyy   Myles: you like germany   Me: i do   Me: a lot   Me: and i really want to go back   Myles: thats cool   Myles: konnen sie es sprechen   Myles: no   Me: ja, ich kenne deutsch   Me: but technically   Me: if i were to correct that   Me: sie is formal you   Me: so itd be kannst du es sprechen   Myles: wow, im impressed   Me: :-)   Me: but well, being in german 4 id hope i know how to ask if you know german..   Myles: haha   Myles: yahh   Myles: i guess your right   Me: are you in spanish?   Me: or french   Myles: yes , im in spanish   Me: do you like it?   Myles: well, i like all languages, its preety easy, but i like it   Me: thats good   *Six minutes later*   Me: so what classes are you taking next year?   *Four minutes later*   Me: ok, well i g2g for dinner   Me: see you tomoror   Me: w   *Eleven minutes later*   Myles: byeee se ya tomrowww   Ok. So when I got back from eating dinner, I had a notification, and it was that Myles had tagged me in a note '25 Random Things About Me!' so I had to read it. And OMG. Anyway, he must have been looking at my profile and saw that I like Germany... And he knows some German, some French, he's fluent in Italian, he knows Spanish, and a little Russian...   Anything? About any of this? Like do you think he likes me or anything?

I'm a perfectly normal person besides having this speech anxiety and being really shy. I communicate with my friends by writing things down. I've had tough times with my life as you can probably imagine, being mute and all. I've been wondering if there is anyone out there that would actually take the time to get to know me before judging me by "someone who doesn't talk", and if working around this problem would actually be possible. Would you guys date someone who was mute? Honest answers would be appreciated... Thanks.
20090222122451AAlDuPl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help I am too horny!!!!!!!!?	I'm 16 years old and in the 10th grade. Ever since about 7th grade I have had the uncontrollable urge to masturbate. I would go to the bathroom during school it would get so bad. Anyways I have this problem with being too horny all the time and not being able to concentrate. I was able to get away with this and still have a 4.2 gpa in grades 7-9 because they were easy, but now I am taking some hard classes, and when I get horny I can't focus on taking notes. I think the problem is that too many girls get me really turned on.... Like I guess I am not very picky. Like if A girl has an average/ semi ugly face and a hot body that gets me really turned on, or if she has An good face but really ugly body that also gets me really turned on. Heck, there are some girls that get me horny that only have like average looking faces but are fairly chubby... And thats only girls who are not that attractive!!!! Imagine how aroused I get when I see girls who look like Jessica alba.... My questions are   1) how Can I control this during school? Because recently in most of my classes my seat was moved to the back and This gave me the opportunity to masturbate during class (and yes I realize how disgusting that is... But I just can't seem to resist the urge)      2) Will my uncontrollable horniness go away as I finish up puberty? I am pretty sure I am not done yet because I like no facial hair yet, the only colored facial hair I grow is on my upper lip and it is not that thick and can only be seen when You are close to me, all my other facial hair is just peach fuzz.          This is really starting to bug me, and it makes me feel disgusted with myself, the only good thing that I can see coming from this is that I won't find it very hard to have an attractive girlfriend lol.

20090222131435AAk8qWV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you start to go crazy when you don't know everything in a relationship?	In a relationship, when you know your partner isn't telling you something, or their feelings have changed, do you drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out?      Or, if you have a break up and you can't quite figure out what happened and why and they just won't tell you?      How do you handle that?         Personally, I end up resenting the person and asking a lot of questions. Even when they finally answer, I don't believe them because I have ideas and answers I created while they weren't telling me.

They already know we've been together for a while. He says that he just doesn't want to have to hear the teasing from his family or hear his parents yelling about the relationship. I sort of don't want the ring because it symbolizes a promise to in the end be together, but if he still can't stand up for me when his parents disapprove then what's the point. I feel like he's always going to listen to them and just concede in order to avoid "hearing it" from them. I feel like if you love someone you shouldn't care what others think. Is this wrong of me? Should I still accept the ring or give it back?

20090222123845AAztL2V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy gift ideas......?	I have no idea what to get my bf. We have been dating for what will be a year and 3 months when his birthday rolls around soon. But I dont know what to get him. He doesnt have a favorite band or music or restaurant or anything like that. For Christmas I gave him his favorite cologne, so thats out. And for our 1-year anniversary I gave him a scrapbook of us, so thats out too. I want to give him something sweet and romantic, but also something he rly wants, cuz I know that guys dont always want the mushy gushy stuff. He will be 17. Any ideas? Thanks!
20090222120511AAtGUw3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He liked me.. now im not so sure.. HELP! guys n girls r welcome to answer?	So I like this guy and we were writing on each others facebooks the other day. Then a day later on valentines day he sent me a message and gave me his number. It was weird cuz the message was a response to something I had written to him like a month ago saying if he needed help with any more tutoring he should just let me know.      [I use to tutor him but I never actually helped, we just flirted the whole time..]      Anyways so he had to have been digging through his inbox, just to reply to it. So I kinda felt like he liked me back sorta. I replied to his message saying okay cool but u gave 8 numbers not 7. Then he sent his correct number and that was that. I didn't reply after that.      I also thought he liked me because: We're always in the library talking and flirting during lunch, cuz we'd rather starve than sit with our fake friends. But anyways one day, I sat down in the library, and the seat he would usually sit in was taken so he walked in the library and sat somewhere else. then i look back at him and he winked at me. Also last year he liked me, his friend told me.      anyway, yesterday I noticed that he deleted everything I said to him off his wall. Why would he do that? He only deleted the comments I wrote, and nobody elses. I'm confused. Anybody have an explanation? I also noticed he deleted his ex-gf.. hmm   He doesnt have a girlfriend, i know that for a fact. anyways.    I don't wanna ask him why he did that.. cuz then it'd make me look like a stalker..lol so theres no way im gonna ask him. no way.   but I'm confused. Why would he do that?   I'm not mad, Im just curious as to why he'd do that.    When I see him on monday [tmrw], it's just gonna be normal like nothing happened..but Idk this is just sorda weird.   like WHYY wud he delete them?

20090222110550AAEuwa1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the best way to get your ex to come back?	Me and this girl dated for 3 years online. She came and visited often at my state, and we dated quite a few times. We talked on the phone for a little over 8000 hours, so we know each other very well.   She admitted to cheating on me two weeks ago. When she told me, she said she wanted for me to be her friend and she would definitely re-consider our relationship if her new relationship didn't work out the way it should.. I refused and hung up.   I have done so much with her. I know her like the back of my hand. I know she still has feelings for me, but bleh. She doesn't show them hardly anymore.   Her dad told me that after she graduates high school she is moving to my state to be closer to his parents. I believe this is when her new relationship will break up, but I really don't feel like sitting around and waiting for that drama to happen.   Why would she cheat on me and then tell me to be her backup? That's so rude! Why would she do that after 3 years?      I forgive her, but it still leaves a scar.      Is there any way I can prove my love to her? Is there any way that I can prove to her that love is better than location? I know she will want to come back to me, but I don't want her to think that I don't love her anymore. I can't be too flirty, because then she will think that I'm a needy guy, then she will ignore me.      (Moving on is out of question. I know it is the right thing to do, but I'm kinda turned off about other girls right now.. lol.)

20090222123439AAkB5rU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I should have known she didn't like me ...?	For the past few weeks a girl who's sat next to me has looked at me a lot, sort of longingly almost (as if she wanted me to talk to her) ... I was too busy talking with my other friend and working on homework, so I didn't pay her much attention; that and I was a bit too shy to initiate convo because she's a pretty cute girl and I don't fare well in awkward situations (who does, lol)...      Anyway I was planning on actually trying to get to know her better this week, but she wasn't displaying the normal signs that she's at least curious about me. She didn't stare at all (and we sit next to each other), so I'm a bit flustered. Perhaps she's simply a nervous girl in general and didn't actually think anything of me? I looked at her and said something small but she didn't reply happily or anything. Maybe this thing about her liking me was some hopeful concoction I produced in my head ? I'm so confused, girls drive me nuts !

I went to a camp last week and I met this guy - he was soo beautiful - only trouble was his frends and my frends tried to set us up , they forced us to talk to each other and (although it was gd they did in a sense) it made it really awkward between us. We ran away and he asked me out, I agreed but then when the others found out they kept trying to make us do stuff which we didnt want to do (well at least i didnt at that moment) and there was a moment where i really wanted to kiss him but i didnt because i had no idea how to.   It got really awkward and i couldnt help but not talk to him all i could really do was smile at him and he'd smile back :s then just b4 we had to leave he told me that there was probabbly no point in going out because we lived to far from eachother (although i know that was not the whole situation)   I called him yesterday and suggested we meet up (just as friends) and he said "sounds good" but he didnt know when he was free and so he said he'd text me when he knew...yet he still hasent text me...hes normally really gentlemanly so im confused...WHAT DO I DO?!!!

But he never texted back, that is, until 11PM at night he asked me for a favor, and I was thinking "Aww, He's gonna make it up to me." No. He wanted me to update something on his myspace profile. Then when I finished he said: "Thanks, I'm gonna go to sleep. Bye!" I was so angry! && Now he has a girlfriend because he said there was no point in liking me if we couldn't go out. Were friends now, && Were gonna go out in 2 years, Which is when my mom stops protecting... But was I right to be pissed on him for ignoring me on V-day?!

20090222111421AAjt1Vc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he using me for sex?	Okay..   well I have this promise ring.   And most of you out there know what a promise ring means.   If not, it means basically that your going to wait to have sex until marriage.      Anyways! I was hanging out with my boyfriend a few nights ago at a game thing. And we were alone and I say, "i'm so cold." This is what he said, "Well I know a way where your hands won't be cold." And of course I said.. uh no. I'm alright. I knew what he meant too... he had that little grin on his face. And a few times he mentioned a few things about his dick.   Holy **** though! I'm only 14! In the 9th grade!   Do you really think that i'm ready?   I KNOW I'M NOT.   But just sometimes I think he's trying to use me. Or something of that nature. I've told him mutiple times about my ring. And he say's he's willing to wait.. it just doesn't seem that way. I mean... all the time he hints at sexual stuff. What the hell do I have to do to make it clear to him that I don't want sex?! Oh and when I told him about my ring we almost broke up. So I think he thinks that eventually i'll give in.. or something like that. What should I do? :/

Hi I'm 19 and met this guy whos 33 at my friends birthday party we slept together and had a great laugh. I later found out he has a long term girlfriend but their relation ship is dead as i even asked my friend who known him all her life. I did confess to her what me and this guy did i wanted to be honest with my friend. I added him on facebook and he asked me for my number which i thought was odd because it was basically a one night stand. I did give him by number and we had been texting all week and he rang me quiete a few times, the first time he called me after giving me his number he asked why I had just left with out saying good bye and to see if i was ok. The thing is he lives 3.5 hours away and after knowing him for a week he came and saw me. The thing is people dont drive 3.5 hours for sex, pay for everything and put effort in. So my question is what do you think he wants from me. He says he intrigued by my atitude and my personality, but still he has a gf.........Can someone tell me???

20090222130205AAg7lh9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok in your opinion for guys to shave their legs if they have a legitimate reason to?	My bf during the winter doesn't shave but during the summer he does because it helps him to stay a little bit cooler.  He says it helps him and he's more comfortable.  In my opinion personally, I don't mind it, he doesn't look that bad especially when he gets a tan.  He's in good shape and is not the tallest guy in the world (about 5'7ish) so I think he can get away with doing it, and no people, he doesn't act gay or anything.  He's as straight and as masculant as all straight guys are.  I've been dating him for five years.

20090222112708AAleM2T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best friends to falling in love?	Ok, this has been the biggest aspect of my life over the past 6 years and to put every detail and twist and turn that has occurred would take a novel so I'll go through the basics. I met this girl, who became my best friend (I'm a guy) in grade 7 and through till now when I'm in my first year of university, we have been best friends. I have always been in love with her since we were little in junior high, and not a day or minute went by when I didn't think of her and I made it very obvious buying her flowers frequently and telling everyone in our high school. I never knew however if she liked me during all of this as she never told anyone she did. There were always the odd hints she did, or comments, but nothing concrete and she dated other guys and had crushes on our guys during this time. They were always very short relationships.       Anyways, we had a huge fight as she got mad I was talking about how I was going to go and make out with this girl and she said I was just trying to make her jealous and she didn't care. This was over a text.We didn't talk for 2 weeks till I went home for Spring Break. She told me then officially that she really liked me and saw us having a future together and getting married and she always dreamt of us having kids and growing old together. However, she didn't think I was mature enough to date yet and she still didn't know for sure as some days, she would think I was the One and other's not be sure. She wants to date other guys for a few years before we date to be sure she knows for sure and to test us.       She found out I lost my virginity in university to a ****, and was really upset by this as she expected us to lose it together as she is still a virgin and always pictured it being us. She still thinks we might be for the first time for her, but is really trouble I slept with someone else and has cried for nights over it. She also told me her entire family loves me and wants us to date and knows that I'm transferring universities next year back to our hometown so I'm not so far.       What do you guys think? Do you think she likes me? Or what. It's really confusing. I would think she does as she says she wants her first time to be with me, and we snuggled on the couch and stuff after she told me and she has kissed me previously when she was drunk though at a party. The thing is she has crushes on other guys and wants to date other people right now first, yet before that maybe have a physical relationship with me? That confuses me as to whether she really likes me. Even though she has planned our future, and we've even had minor discussions now about kids and stuff.

20090222111948AAv6XV8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Major love problem :( help me.?	So, theress this guy named Daniel, and after along time of being afraid of commitment, he came into my life. at first i fought what i was feeling for him, telling him ididn'tt want to be in a relationship, and then i confessed what i was feeling but suggested an "open" relationship. when he made i clear that when he was with someone, it was just her and him. I tried to push away....but it was inevitable i fell in love with him. We did not officially get together yet. But it was going to happen very soon. I made i clear to him about everything i felt. I also told him about my past, and my was promiscuouss life. One thing he made clear to me was that other ppl in our relationship just would not go for him. so i agreed that I would be commited to him. Well we get into an argument, not a huge one. We hang up, still angry, and let it sit over night. the next day he does try to be civil, but on top of the fight we had im jsut having a really bad day. so im 3!tchy. and he calls me on it. then the fight gets out of control, i bring up how if we stop talking right now im gonna go **** all these random guys. right then, right after i said those words, he stopped talking to me. and i know im the one in the wrong, i have left him voicemails since he wont answer, emails myspace messages, im's explained to him i knew i was wrong, i said horrible things, and threw something in his face that was well a fear of his. What else can i do to make him know im sorry...im truly sorry i love him, i want him to forgive me. but shoud i just let him be? Lose him?

20090222120648AAXjM7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like her, even though I'm his girlfriend?	Okay. Lately my boyfriend and I have been fighting quite a lot. We went on a ski trip with my youth group and while there he met this girl. Let's call her Andrea. Well, at first we were all friends, but he told me he thought she was pretty. He always does that kind of stuff like saying other girls are pretty. It bothers me. Is this wrong? I don't tell him when I think other guys are cute. Well, on the way home she sat in our van and he was talking to her A LOT. They were showing each other pictures of themselves on their cell phones. Also, he would tap her and then pretend it wasn't him, that sort of thing like flirting. Now he has her added on Facebook and he commented one of her pictures where she was looking the other way and he was like "oh you were checking me out haha jk." Also, at church he always looks for her and she gave him a hug. Do you think he likes her? Please be honest. Everytime I bring her up he tells me to drop it and says I don't like her blah blah blah.

Theres not one person that makes me feel the way that you do! When we are together it's as thoough we have our own little world! Your the only person that is able to make me smile on both the inside and out. I honestly don't have a clue what i'd do without you. The only one thing that i long for and dream about is to spend forever with you, i never want to let you go.   We've both been through some pretty hard times recently and i'm just a bit sad that we wern't there for each other more. I want to get everything back to how it was. I just feel as though i need more... whenever we are apart i miss you! Im just so scared of getting my heart broken again. I feel so afraid and vunerable. Im so scared of the way you make me feel!      BUT      'Remember tonight, for this is the beginning of always. A promise, like a reward for persisting through life so long alone. A belief in each other and the love we share. A decision to simply ignore and rise above the pain in the past. A covenant, which at once blinds two soles and yet serves prior ties. The celebration of the chance taken and the challenge that lies ahead. For two will always be stronger than one. Like a team braced against the tempests of the world. And love will always be the guiding force in our lives. For tonight is a mere formality. Only an announcement to the world of feelings long held, promises made long ago in the sacred space in our hearts.'      All my love xxx
20090222110922AARdaEh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I let him on, rejected him and now i want him, help!?	Basically I was leading this guy on for a few months, nothing major - I know i shouldn't of done this in the first place. Then we were at a party the other night and he came onto me i basically said that me and him just wouldnt work and he seemed confused - I don't really blame him. I then proceeded to tell a 'friend' that I wasn't actually interested in him whatsoever and that so called 'friend' told him. I left, got home and called him up because I genuinely regretted what I was doing he seemed angry with me but i figured it would all be fine in the morning. So in the morning I talk to him and he seems off with me I ask why and he says he doesn't want to talk about it. Now I want him and he won't even speak to me! Someone help, please?

20090222111424AA93keK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Its not too long.. guys help? girls too if you can?	so i really like this guy. and hes never had a girlfriend before so surely hes not going to be very good at messing girls about? (its not that hes bad looking, he just blends into the background so girls dont tend to notice him). anyway, my friend told him i liked him, he asked me about it so i admitted it, but it didn't change our friendship. then one day he asked me to set him up with my friend, so understandably i got    mad cos he knew how much i liked him, so we had a fight, but agreed to be civil. then a few days later he randomly texts me asking what i'm up to, so we started talking, then he said something like so do you have a boyfriend, and i was like no why? and he was like 'its just someone like you shouldn't be single.' then i said something about me and my friend maybe getting together and he was all like 'ooh   competition?' so i said 'well its not really competition cos recently you've made it clear you dont like me!' and he was like 'how have i' so i said 'by asking me to set you up with my friend!' and he claims that was cos he was 'bored'.. and im not sure if hes just messing me about cos surely he shouldn't be too good at that if girls haven't payed him attention before??

20090222130451AACabDA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend is hurting me badly?	Hi all my girlfriend is being really confusing latley, i have been with her for 2.5 years, and i have been in the army for 1.5 years. the other day she told me that she doesnt think we should be together anymore, or shes no sure if she loves me as much as she did, she still says she loves me and that she misses me, but she dont know if it is the same as before.       The strange thing about all this is that not even a week ago she was telling me how much she wants a family with me and how much she cant be without me, she said that she lives her life for our future. And now she is saying she wants to live her life for herself, literally 1 day after she said the other stuff.       I looked on the internet for help and i came across a site that was about loneliness and what it does to you, and it seems 99% that this is what she is suffering from, she said she wants to have time apart for 1 week to see how she feels then, but im scared she will say she dont want me anymore, i can understand why she would do this to me she has been telling me that all she ever wants is me, then 2 days later she doesnt, does anyone know what this could be, has this ever happened to any of you?      Yes she is back home, she is 6-7 hour drive each way from me, she once felt like this before, but after about 1-2 days she felt normal again, and after that she said she doesnt kow what came over her, and that she will never feel like that again, but obviously she has, i have given her, the week she asked, and its only 1 day onto it, and it hurts so bad, literally i have a constant ache in my chest that wont go away, it makes me fell not hungry and i do want to do anything, i have no motivation. If after this week she says she doesnt want to be with me anymore, i will let her go, but im only letting her go becasue i love her so much and i only want her to be happy, even if it means living without her. I know im supposed to be a tough solider and everything, but to be honest love can bring event he biggest and strongest men to their knees, and belive me, im on my knees.      BTW this is a re-post i need more answers please give any advice you can.

20090222112157AAArWS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?? He is using me more not?!?	Well to cut a long story short.. I met this guy a couple of weeks back.. hes a friend of an old mate of mine. He seemed really sweet to begin with and we had the same likes and everything, we hit it off really quickly so when he asked me out I thought what the hell and said yes. For the first few days it was great, he was still really sweet and kind but then he kept asking me if I would do anything for him and then asked me to gain extra weight for him... I'm already a 14/16 and am very self-concsious about my how  I look. Immediately I told him No and told him that we were over because he obviously didn't love me they way I loved him.... I didn't contact him at all... it was my best mate that did because she was worried about me. Normally I tell her everything but with this I couldn't tell her. I was ashamed I fell for a guy like that (my past boyfriends have been total s**ts to me)    He told her that he still loved me and wanted me back, he asked her if she would get me to talk to him. I did just to hear what he had to say.   Somehow he managed to make everything seem ok again, he was back in my heart and I felt happy again.. I know that probably sounds stupid but that's the feeling I get when I talk to him.   Last week he did the same thing to me again... he asked to me to gain weight so that we would 'both' be happy in this relationship.    I flipped as he managed to get into my head again... I didn't want to talk to him every again. I deleted all his messages, his number. Everything that reminded me of him.   I was getting through this until my so called mate texted him saying that he shouldn't have been an **** and should apologise. He did! He said he was so sorry for everything... so I started talking to him again.  He seems really sorry and has said that he should have never asked me to do that and wants me for me the way I am....    He wants there to be a future between us but I don't know what I should do?   Is he using me? Am I ever going to be good enough for him? Will he ask me to change for him again??   WHAT SHOULD I DO???   Any advice then please tell me....

20090222115714AAetKyz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this weird, cute, sweet love story? (Girls)?	Well i got this from somewhere, okay.      There were three people sitting at a table, one guy and two girls.   They were talkin about their first kisses. Only one of the girls had gotten her first kiss.  Suddenly the other girl walks away. The girl that stayed told the guy to kiss her the next day.       The next day it was only the guy and the girl. They started to talk just like any other day. Then he kisses her. She didnt know what to think, then she asks him, why did you do that? he didnt tell her until he admited what they told him to do.        She got real mad and ran to the other side of the school. She just sat there alone. Her eyes were watery. He chases after her. He sits down beside her.         He starts to ask her to forgive him, he asks her how he could make it up to her. She tells him,"you have to promise me you wont ever do that unless you mean it." He promises.        Of course she was a little mad, but she knew he would never do it again and she trusted as he was one of her best friends. They started talkin just like any other day, until there is silence. Slowly they look at each other, and he kisses her. Imeditaly after, she told him,"Why didnt you keep your promise?"  He replied, I just did!

20090222112752AA7aHiA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she still like me after the break up? What should I do or say?! :(?	My girlfriend and I recently broke up a week ago. She still calls me our nicknames and such as "bear" and so forth. I don't really see her often anymore, but she texts me sometimes to say good night, or calls me at times. She said this in my truth box:      "Hey bear, its me. I just wanted to say, like i always do that I really think youre doing better off without me I looked at your pictures and with your friends you were much happier and out there than with me yesterday you seem really comfortable with them and although i wish we could be that happy as friends together im thrilled that youve at least found reasons to smile take care, love"      I'm thinking that maybe she's jealous of some sort and unexpected to see that I'm doing so well. I told her to not think that I'm doing better "without her" because that's ridiculous.       I went to hang out with a few friends and some girl named Kelly and she knew about this, and she goes "have fun with kelly" but knew I was hanging with other friends. She refuses to say that she's "jealous" but it totally seems so.      I'm just really curious. I'm still in love with her, and I've been with her for over 16 months, so it's been quite sometime for teenage relationships. I mean, I'd do anything for her. Does she seem like she still likes me? And if so, what should I do or say?

Could you tell a girl ALL the time how much you like them, how much you care for them, how beautiful and amazing they are.   Get jealous if the girl is around other guys and just simply always making it clear how much you like them, but then out of nowhere, act cold? Not text them and just be different? Why do you guys do this? Did he find somebody else? Cause I don't understand how he would of found somebody else just like that when he has been makin it really clear that he was falling for me. Is this just the way guys get sometimes, I don't understand? I've texted him and he texts me back but very coldly. I have been trying, but now im feeling like im getting clingy and I don't wanna keep texting him and feel like im annoying him.  Yesterday I sent him a text like at 4 and I didn't text him anymore and he didn't either.  Today neither of us have texted eachother.. What do I do? Do I text him or wait? And why is he doing this? I am trying so hard to understand guys, I really am. Opinions please?

20090222115616AAM5ycL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my boyfriend to stand up for me when his dad calls me stupid?	My boyfriend's dad always calls me stupid. He said I didn't put the grease up in the kitchen because I am too stupid and don't know how... wtf? I know to pour... Anyways, he says this despite the fact that I am about to graduate in May with 3 degrees (in 4 years)... I am obviously not stupid, and I know this. But he says, "You're stupid, you're not going to be able to do anything with your degrees, you're stupid, stupid, stupid!" When I ignore me, he says "You can't even come up with a good comeback!" Today he called me stupid almost 20 times within 5 minutes for various reasons (such as the grease thing). He just likes to "mess" with me, but sometimes you just can't take it anymore. Today I came very close to being violent for the first time in my life, and I almost broke a plate over his head. GRRRR! I am so frusterated. This happens on a regular basis. My boyfriend doesn't do anything.  He says his dad is just messing with me, and to "knee him in the nuts". I have asked him to stand up for me before, but he says that he does not get involved because he wants me to learn to stand up to him myself. What can I do? His dad just completely soiled my happy-go-lucky mood that I had for the first time this week :-(

I want to do something that would kind of let him know i'm interested, but not completely distract him because the main reason we are there is to watch the concert. I don't want to spend the whole time trying, because I wanna watch the concert as well. It's not like I can try to grind with him because we aren't in a club, and talking is completely out of the question. Please help?

20090222115048AAw9s3G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Tell Him? Please Read All. [[Guys Especially.]]?	Recently, a friend of mine came up to visit me (about a month ago) and we ended up having feelings for each other and had sex. I fell for him, hard. After he left, we still kept in contact and from what I understand, he has feelings for me too. Hes done a lot of good things for me. He's the reason I stopped cutting.      He's is going into the army soon, the beginning of march (around the tenth) and I had planned on telling him that I wanted to start a real relationship with him.      But this morning I got a message from him saying that he was starting a relationship with his best friend.      I dont know if I should tell him, I want to tell him because I think he deserves to know, but I also don't want to put him through that.      I also believe I should tell him because i'm afraid if I don't I might start cutting again, and I really don't want to go back to that.      Any help? Please be serious.      If your a guy, would you want to be told?

I'm been with my current boyfriend for 3 months and I love him very much, he is a great guy and the best in bed ever. He is all I think about. Now my ex is a loser who I was with for 5 years and have a daughter with, he treated me like crap and cheated on me every chance he got. I did love him but came to my senses when I met my current boyfriend.   We were getting hot and heavy last night and I called him by my ex's name, which totally killed the mood. I feel so bad! I wasn't even thinking and didn't know I said it til my boyfriend was pissed out. My ex wasn't even on my mind AT ALL, all I was thinking about my boyfriend and how bad I wanted him.   I just think I did it because for 5 years thats what I said to my ex and I'm wired just to react and say that. I understand why my boyfriend is mad and hurt, I would be too!    Why did I call out my ex's name?? I wasn't even thinking about him! How do I stop? Also how can I make it up to my boyfriend??

Okay, my boyfriend is amazing and he's more like my best friend with... cough cough... "benefits". Like he doesn't even get jealous over other guys when they talk to me. But lately, he's been getting uncomfortable with a freshman talking to me, as am i.   i didn't even know who he was until i began sitting with my boyfriend at lunch. like one day, i wore a skirt to school, and the freshman goes "emily's not wearing any pants! Lets take a look!" and he stuck his head under the table. later, my boyfriend said with some discomfort, "he was checking you out a lot." another time, the freshman grabbed my hand. another- asked for number. another- flirting with me incessantly. another- changes seats in class to sit next to me. another- asked that i looked professional. like a secretary. wtf??????    does the freshman like me or something? it gets super annoying, and my boyfriend really dislikes the dude, and i'm worried that the freshman will do something that will create tension between me and my boyfriend.

20090222122109AAofLrE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I my boyfriend AND his brothers maid?	So over Christmas break I went to stay with my boyfriend for a week and celebrate New Years Eve together. He lives in a 2 bed roomed apt with his brother. So being the guest I expected to be treated as such to some degree. My boyfriend usually works from 3-11pm and his brother came home around 2pm for lunch then back for good at 4/5pm.   So I never expected to be forced to do house chores. I would naturally pitch in once in a while but all the time is ridiculous. So on the first day I called my boyfriend at his work and I was like "Do you guys expect me to cook for you and do dishes? I'm your guest!" And he's like "You don't have to if you don't want to" aka "yeah you do".   I was so pissed off because I'm like we've only been together 2months and I'm expected to take care of you AND your brother?! His brother would come home and play on his computer and WAIT for me to cook. He never once offered to help. And he'd come home at 2pm expecting lunch! And all my boyfriend would say is "you dont have to. Do what you want." Which was obviously a lie.   So now he wants me to go over there for my whole entire 12days of Spring break! I love my boyfriend but going over there just to be him AND his brother's maid is unacceptable. What do I do? Am I wrong to feel this way? My reasoning is dude I'm just your girlfriend not your fiancee or wife! IDK. Help!
20090222122136AAISO82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about this boy?	Here we go i can't really tell if this boy likes me or not, (both 15 year olds) I like him, i know that much, but i'm shy so that's no use lol. Basically he's quite a loud, cheeky kind of boy who's always cracking jokes and telling the stories in big groups and making everyone laugh.       Whenever we're like talking in a group he seems to make perfect eye contact with me, like when he's speaking with me and a few others he'll look at me for most of it and occasionally look in another direction. Or if he's telling a funny story he'll look at me at the end of it, like to check that i'm laughing or something. And whenever i speak in a group (which isn't alot cos i'm quite shy) he'll just stare at me, but when i look at him he'll look away.  And everything i say he'll pick up on, or make fun of in a friendly way kind of thing.      But the thing is, when i'm on my own with him, as i say im shy, i try to just like ask him questions to make some kind of effort, but he can't seem to make eye contact and he goes really shy, and just answers the question but doesn't say anything else after that. But then when he's around others he just always pays attention to me and tries to get my attention. Also he's very like, sweet and caring with me i suppose. He always does things like i couldnt get my drink bottle open (haha) he did it for me. There was some like broken glass in the canteen on the floor and i was about to walk over it but he like pulled me back. Just things like that, make me wonder.      Anyone ideas? Sorry for the essay.

20090222130008AAllxqZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay So I Like This Guy? Help?	( Sorry this is going to be long )       So I like this guy. I've known him for about a month. He is 20 and I'm turning 23 soon. I dont usually find myself attracted to younger guys but for some reason he's awesome. We have alot of the same things in common and we hang out on almost a daily basis. We say I love you to each other and act like a typical boyfriend/girlfriend would in a relationship. Here's the catch.. We're just friends. He says he's not attracted to me like that. He knows I would give anything to be with him and he agrees that I'd be the perfect girlfriend IF he liked me like that. I need some advice on what to do... we're both single and I know he's going to eventually find a girlfriend therefore crushing me ( even though we're just friends) I dont want to make it akward. Can I have some advice? I'd really like to be in a serious relationship with him, anyone got any advice on how to make him change his mind?

I have a tendancy to change my looks alot, not like crazy hair dye or anything like that.  Just different hairstyles, makeup or no makeup, that sort of thing.

20090222130334AAfpVD6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said he can't see me in his future?	Okay. So last night my boyfriend went out with his friends. I  was okay with this, up until I found out that this skank that always flirts with my boyfriend was gonna be there. I felt that if she was gonna be there, the least he could do is invite me. He said that they were just friends and I needed to understand that cause he wouldn't stop being friends with her cause of my insecurity. Well we got into a huge fight. And he went anyways and ignored my calls and texts. When he got home, he texted me and things had cooled down. He said to me that he truly loves me and he doesn't want anything more than me to stay his girlfriend, BUT he's can't see me in his future. He said that this isn't the way he plans to live his life, being tied down to a girl. And that he does as he pleases and he doesn't want any girl to interfere with that especially since he's still young. And then he said he's not breaking up with me, but he needs time to think. This hurt so much. I mean me and this kid have talked about marriage, kids, and most of the time he was the one to bring it up. So im so confused and I can't stop crying. All this time, me thinking me were gonna spend the rest of our lives together and now im confused. And I feel like it was all lies and like I wasted so much time with him. I don't understand? Can anyone please help me understand? Guys.. girls too?

Sometimes I just have a problem sleeping there though as he has a different sleeping schedule and in general when I am trying to sleep I would rather cuddle him and it keeps me awake. :) A couple times lately though, if I want to stay up a bit longer with him at night, or in a bit longer in the morning, he will say something along the lines of, "I can't, I have to go to WORK" (I am a master student.. he is a bit older). He doesn't say this harshly but it still makes me feel like a child. Would this make you mad if someone said this? What should I do? We have only been together a few months and I don't feel like I am demanding or clingy, and he is usually a sweet guy. :/
20090222130817AAM5Mxi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are some sure signs that a guy likes you?	okay I really don't get this guy, I don't know if he likes me, or just using me, or just likes the idea of me having a crush on him...He is very unpredictable and I never know what he is going to do or say next.   I told him that I like him 1 month ago and he was very respectful, not making fun of me or anything, he even start hanging out with me and trying to get to know me even more which I considered a bit strange ( I meen if u tell I guy u like and he is not into u he'll start avoiding u)....but the thing is I know so little bout him, he never talks much bout him and when he does he says smt like: "I'm the best and you know it and I'm always right!" :D ( he really is the hottest guy I have ever met and has a lil bit of ego but probably well deserved). SO much happend after I confest him what I feel bout him, but just yesterday, I was on msn and he was first time online after 3 months...and wrote me first asking me how I am, what am I doing....I was like not much, seating  home, bored, my girlfriends are to busy to go on coffee with me sooo ummm I stayed at home today...and he was like:U know what? U never ask the right person to go to coffee with u, I never say NO for a coffee ...and thennnn he said that he was hoping to finde ME online and I always forget to ask u bout youre cell...and I gave it to him....I don't know what that was all about but It was kinda strange and I don't know what to think cuz once I thought he was a player but the when I get to know him more I reallized he is a wonderfull person and now I'm not sure about anything.......what do u think?
20090222131912AA89cQC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does this sound to you?	so this guy wants to get together... and i have a really romantic idea.      i've only done this with one other guy, but the results were... amazing :]         we (me and the 1st guy) went to a dark, abandoned field in the middle of the night, laid out a blanket, laid down together, and looked at the stars... naturally, we began to kiss and so on and so forth and the end result was the most romantic, sensual, fulfilling experience of my life... it was perfect... there was even romantic, sexy latin music playing softly from a nearby house... i would HIGHLY urge you to try this at least once in your life :]      But hey, feedback please!  Does this appeal to you? Do you think my guy will like it? :] Guys, would you like to do something like this with your girl?

20090222131601AAHOeK2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I really try this?	Ok, so here's the background: I like this girl in lower year. We've been making eyes, and i've walked her to her class a few times. I really like her, and all I know is her name and the fact that she's in English when i'm in physics on a Thursday = ] (yes it's that type of relationship).      Anyway, I KNOW she's interested in me, it's obvious. But, heres the thing, i've only ever liked one other girl like I like her, they're one in a million. She's different though.       Anyway, here's the question: I get a bus home and she walks home (I live quite far away from school). I think I should walk her home, y'know be all flirty and conversationy. Would that show that I really like her? That i'm willing to miss my bus just to walk her home? Damn, she makes me crazy.      Thanks if you actually read this.

20090222135038AAmFR82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are boys like buses? (You wait ages for one then two come along at the same time!)?	I was mad about this one guy, and we eventually started a thing which I was ecstatic about - but now we've known each other for longer it's starting to get a bit boring, and I'm starting to see all the negative things about him rather than the positive. Then I met another guy who is just my friend and nothing more - but he's so amazing I feel like we can really relate to each other and he actually said that to me, thing is he's friends with the first guy and he knows that we have a thing together. I don't know for certain that guy no 2 is actually interested in me - it might only be a friend thing - and I know I'm not miss perfect myself - but I just feel like I'd be so much better off with the second guy. Am I being too picky? I feel like I should be grateful for what I've got, and when I see him I do actually still like the first guy. Plus he hasn't done anything wrong and I can't just let him down because I'm selfish or childish or something... not sure what to do next...

I've heard stories about girls who go ice skating just so they can fall over and let the boys help them up.      Do any of you actually do this? Or have done this? Is it deliberate or not?      I'm asking cause a girl did that to me once, let's call her Bob just for a laugh and no I'm not gay.      So Bob kept skating past me and falling over like she would be going faster than me (I'm a slow skater) and she would fall over every single time like right infront of me even when I was resting on the sides.      Anyway so I be nice and ask if she's alright, she says yup and I say k cya and just leave her there lol.      I'm not mean, I was just letting her know I wasn't interested.      So ladies/girls, what is your opinions on the Ice Rink Trick?
20090222134911AAJ2U56	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the difference between a guy who likes you vs. a stalker. I'm confused?	There is this guy who seems to know me somewhat in detail. We have never talked but he makes remarks during presentations about things I have talked about with friends outside of class that are irrelevent to class. None of my friends know him & he seems to thrive on attention when I look at him in class-(when I am not looking at him, he will bring up stuff I have talked about).       I have a class with one of his friends but only talk to him in class. His friend has asked me twice what I think about this class and tells me I will make a good friend & how he is a good friend of his & says I will make a good friend.       I do think he's cute but it creeps me out when he brings up irrelevent stuff that I have talked about outside of this class with my good friends. It's like he knows me or something. I can't say I have seen anyone lurking out my window or anything but I just find this weird.      Your thoughts??

20090222163055AAFiToG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you believe in love?	Do you believe that there is somebody for everybody?  Somebody that gives you a reason to wake up every morning, a reason to smile when you are sad, somebody that you would- with no questions- give your life for, no matter what.  Somebody who you always care about more than you care about yourself.  You solve every problem you go through, and you solve it together, you are not afraid of anything and you trust them completely, that they will never lie, steal, cheat, etc.  If you have been in love, please tell me your feelings towards your partners, and if it's ok with you, some problems you have been through, and how you got through them together.

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

Well im not in love.. but you know when you have a huge crush on a person and they are in your head constantly and you smile every time someone brings up their name.   Well thats what im going through now! And we text each other constantly and i think he likes me too. His friends always joke about us being together and he says im gorgeous etc. But none of us have actually made a move yet. Well ive only known the guy for a week but my feelings for him are so strong, but i dont want to just come out and tell him how i feel..    How can i tell if he likes me?   What do you think i should do to sort of make a move without actually making one!      Ive just broke up with my boyfriend this weekend, and i think deep down its because of the other guy. Cause we had a silly argument but i said i dont want to see him any more. And i dont, i dont have feelings for him really and i havent for a while. But this new guy knows ive only just broke up with him. And i dont know what to do cause i dont want people to think im moving on too quickly. I dont usually, but me and my ex were in a situation where it could end at any time. So im not being heartless by moving on so quickly. Im just so in "love" with this new guy!.      Anyone got any advice?

So I guess the guy moved on cause nothing happened! So my friend asked me too ask him out for her! Then I did! He said "No I have a girlfriend."(This was about 3 months ago) then my friend was okay with it! So I got on Face book the same night and it said he was single!(Nobody likes my friend cause she doesn't act like her age and she cries all the time and everything) Before I asked him out for her he was flirting with me and he didn't know I was her friend! So now he ignores my friend cause he doesn't like her anymore! He never says anything about his girlfriend and he doesn't talk about any girls around me! I really do like him!!! When I had a boyfriend he would always flirt with me even in front of my boyfriend then my boyfriend and I broke up and now he is still flirting then he found out I liked him and now he is flirting even more he does more thaan flirt also like stare and makes converstation and stuff!!! So does he have a girlfriend or was he saying that to be nice about it????? He doesn't act like he does at all cause im the only girl he flirts with!!!!!His friends says he likes me!!!! Help!!!      Thanks SOOOO much!!!!
20090222145225AABoXyQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I effectively convince my sister's friend to be my girlfriend?	I am interested in my sister's friend and in the past we have dated before but not really as boyfriend and girlfriend.  When the subject came up, she indicated that she did not feel right about being her friend's brother's girlfriend.  She recently broke up with her most recent boyfriend, and we have been talking on the phone a bit, but I still sense that she is reluctant to date me because she is friends with my sister.  I have talked with my sister about the idea, and as it turns out, my sister thinks we would make a great couple, and my sister has even expressed that she could even picture us getting married.  Any thoughts as to how I can convince this girl to give me a chance?       By the way,  I have made up my mind and decided to go all out with this girl, so I am not looking to be talked out of dating my sister's friend or warned about the potential downside, I know all the risks.  I want to find out HOW I can effectively purusue her. Any ideas?

20090222150931AA5mtqW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the motive of her action?	SORRY IF LONG   I am really good friends with this girl. At first i wasn't planning to go to the prom but she made me promise to go. She made me promise i would go because she wanted to make her ex-boyfriend, who she dated for a little more than a year, jealous.      I not sure if her motive is   1. trying to use me as a tool of jealousy in order to get her ex-boyfriend to like her again.    2. she is interested in me and wants to have fun making her ex-boyfriend jealous.   3. Just wants to have fun.      If important- She is a little upset how fast her ex-boyfriend moved on. The break up was around 4 months ago though. Does she still hold a grudge against him? She sends mixed signals to me.      little about me- I'm always up for a good prank. The ex-boyfriend seems to become jealous over me easily. I really don't know why. I've never been successful with starting relationships, nor will i be successful with relationships in my future (until i'm 25:( ) due to parents. BTW, I'm a very dense person. It's hard for me to determine if a gal is interested in me. It usually takes me two months to two years to figure it out unless it is super obvious.      What do you think is the motive to her action?

20090222133737AAn0l9A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I wants to wish my EX-BOYFRIEND a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!" but I'm scared he'll ignore me or will find it weird...?	So I went out with this guy for six weeks from October to December (I know I know not long at all) but anyway I got pretty close to him during that time...We spoke online all the time and met each others families etc...But then he broke up with me and said we'd still be friends...Well, I haven't spoken to him for almost 3 months and I still miss him a lot...He dated someone else since he left me and I'm not sure if he's with anyone at the moment but I still would really like to be friends with him...Even when we were dating I thought of him as more of a friend anyway!      So his birthday is tomorrow and I'm deliberating over whether to wish him a happy one or not...I hoped he would come online (MSN) so I could casually say "happy birthday for tomorrow" but he hasn't...So texting is my only other option, but how would you feel if an ex said this to you...Would it be too weird? Do you think he'd be happy or annoyed? I just know this is my only chance to clear the air and let him know we're cool because he's leaving the country soon :(      My other option is to wait until he comes online after his birthday and say something like "happy birthday for last monday". What do you suggest? I just want my friend back...I know we can never be close again but this is the type of guy who isn't deliberately nasty to anyone and he'd prefer peace to conflict anyday.

I want to know how many of you girls out there use this on a guy whenever you're pissed off at him, and whether or not most of us guys can avoid it or not, because i couldn't. This chick slapped my face, but did it so i was totally thrown off. She gave me this cute smile and then had her hip out and real smooth put her left hand on it. THAT confused me. Then she whipped her opposite(right) hand out and slapped me. Ever used that move before? Saw a girl use it? And tell me whether or not the guy was able to avoid or block it? I can't. I want to know if that has, or does work on most of us. I hope not!

20090222134040AAlzRsq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I still get this guy?	My co-worker tried to pursue me for atleast 1 year now, but, I always gave mixed signals. I always left things where it could really get started between us.   We never even went beyond saying hi/hello.   Now, I have stopped even stopped maintaining eye contact , and saying hi/hello. In the hope that he will move on and so will I.      it is just frustrating that so much non-verbal exchanges happened between us but I still couldn't keep the courage to show more interest in him. I am basically a shy person and bit unconfident because I am indian and he is english. I always felt that things won't work out anyway, why give it anymore try?   But, attraction between 2 of us has been very strong that we always ended up coming in each other's way.      I think the way I have just cut off from him now, he must have moved on because I can see he has started booking a lot of leave every friday. Either he's found someone else or he is going to try hard to find the one.   I am even scared to start talking to him again, because he might just give me a cold shoulder now.   what do you say?

He says there might be a future for us, and hopes there is.  What am I supposed to do? Wait until he breaks up with his girlfriend?  I know he really loves me because he waited for me and loved me for all those years. Does anybody have any advice? Please.

20090222151841AAI1Rt2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think he's thinking?	I'm really interested in getting to know a guy in my class ! We used to always smile and laugh together, and we were so comfortable with eachother. he always asked me how I was doing, how my day or weekend was, etc. i started to have feelings for him. We didn't have eachothers number or anything, we didn't know eachother outside of school. And we would look at eachother in the eyes all the time. Then winter break came along (2 weeks long) that i didn't see him, and then when it was over I walked into class and he made eye contact with me as soon as i walked in, and then he looked away. I said hi to him & he smiled and said hi, but then that was it. He started to become distant from me, like being nervous to talk to me anymore. I tried to approach him in the halls by saying hi, and he was really quiet and didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me...And now, we glance over at eachother during class A LOT. he caught me looking at him and i looked away really fast, and same thing for him. I'm just not sure what he's thinking or how he feels. Everytime we're both laughing really hard about something, we look at eachother and then look away. What do you think about this ? do you think he likes me, and if so, what happened ? I heard that if a guy realizes he likes you, he may get nervous and stop talking to you. well yesturday, he started to talk to me a little, so does that mean that he Doesn't like me ?? lol Please give me your honest opinion, Thanks !

20090222133558AAAM7UB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get her to let me meet him and question him?	Long story short: I like a guy called Danny. He is friends with one of my best friend's friends, called Mike. I've never met Mike, but he told my friend Sophie that Danny never stops talking about me ;). But I can't gather much information from her, 'cause she always says "Oh me and Mike have nothing to do with it. We don't want to get involved" which is stupid because I wouldn't even know he liked me if it wasn't for her and Mike talking about us. I just want to meet Mike so I can ask a few questions about Danny, but Sophie won't introduce me to him. How do I get Sophie to introduce me to Mike?

20090222132524AAdIIQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you feel totally disrespected if?	This guy & I have been getting a little more serious lately. Well he is friends with a guy I'm also friends with. Just yesterday my guy told me that our friend said that one night when I was out with friends and he was there, he told my guy (which the friend doesn't know we like each other) that he would've "hit it" that night, meaning me. When he told me that I was totally appalled because this friend seemed SO nice like he would never say anything like that, especially about me. Well my guy said if I told him that he told me that he would never talk to me again??? I was like what?? For one thing I wouldn't tell him, BUT for him to say that I was kinda confused. And that he also wants to tell our friend about our potential relationship on his terms. We both know that this friend really likes me though so I'm not sure if that's the reason for the hold out or what. Should I be mad if for one, our friend said that, and for two that my guy would still be friends with someone like that? I need some advice.

20090222141839AAQ45lA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She changed after a single question?	it all started about 3 months ago, we met at a friends house and ended up kissing each other and it took off from there. she came over and we started hanging out and sharing life's differences and getting to know each other more and more, realizing how opposite we actually were lol. about a month later we started dating and everything couldn't have been better. im learning so much from her and vice versa, we teach each other so much everyday and it keeps going. shes the first girl to hold off on telling me that she loved me. i was surprised but when we did say i love you, i got butterflies in my stomach and everything just felt so perfect.       well about a week ago after having another great day and things were really looking up and i started actually picturing this woman as my wife. she has always texted or called me when she got there before she went to bed. well she texted me and said "do you think there's a difference between loving someone, and being in love with someone?" i replied back explaining yes there is, and that i didn't "Just" love her i was "IN Love" with her when she asked, but then i got worried and asked if something was wrong and that maybe i wasn't fulfilling my end of the deal. i asked her if maybe i wasn't being generous enough or if i was doing something wrong that would make her think that i wasn't actually IN love with her. i asked her if she was in love with me and she said "Well duh, cant you tell lol" so i don't think it was too bad and of course i can. well ever since that day shes been acting strange, like when we go to the mall to walk around or just sit and watch tv is like shes my best friend, not my girlfriend. she would always stand close to me at the mall and i would be able to hold her when we bought food or just to look at something, and when we walked somewhere she would always hold my hand. well i noticed her acting a little weird and i thought maybe its just a phase or something, but shes completely different, like maybe now that she knows im IN love with her she feels like she wont lose me and that maybe she just has to be there now? or maybe now that she knows im in love with her that everything will just be easy now, when i know that's not true. i mean im a guy and i cant help  but run a million things through my head on what it could be even though what im thinking is probably like 2000% off of what is actually happening. i also kinda feel like maybe shes hiding something from me, something she wont tell me. she told me about how shes good at hiding things from her friends and how you could tell if she was and all that, so its just seems so irrational that i wouldn't be able to tell but im confused, i just dont understand where my sweet, beautiful, loving, caring, girlfriend went?

20090222142430AATeJkC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problems with being horny at school!!!!?	I'm 16 years old and in the 10th grade. Ever since about 7th grade I have had the uncontrollable urge to masturbate. I would go to the bathroom during school it would get so bad. Anyways I have this problem with being too horny all the time and not being able to concentrate. I was able to get away with this and still have a 4.2 gpa in grades 7-9 because they were easy, but now I am taking some hard classes, and when I get horny I can't focus on taking notes. I think the problem is that too many girls get me really turned on.... Like I guess I am not very picky. Like if A girl has an average/ semi ugly face and a hot body that gets me really turned on, or if she has An good face but really ugly body that also gets me really turned on. Heck, there are some girls that get me horny that only have like average looking faces but are fairly chubby... And thats only girls who are not that attractive!!!! Imagine how aroused I get when I see girls who look like Jessica alba.... My questions are   1) how Can I control this during school? I get so horny sometimes that All I think about is sex and can't do my work.      2) Will my uncontrollable horniness go away as I finish up puberty? I am pretty sure I am not done yet because I like no facial hair yet, the only colored facial hair I grow is on my upper lip and it is not that thick and can only be seen when You are close to me, all my other facial hair is just peach fuzz.          This is really starting to bug me, and it makes me feel disgusted with myself.

20090222150825AAgYJQ9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Big problem with ex girlfriend and her ex boyfriend and what not.. 5 points for best answer!?	Okay so heres the deal..      I went for this girl who dated my old best friend.. and they had a long relationship and did some stuff for her first time ever and now she's still stuckk on the old relationship and still has feelings for him..       Well about five days ago I asked her out and she said yes, but throughout the relationship she wasn't that happy.  During the relationship her ex boyfriend talked to her and told her he basically still had feelings for her.. So then yesterday we broke up cause first off she still has feelings for him kind of and we weren't happy with the relationsihp..       At first I was happy that we broke up but now I'm basically depressed and she's even sadder too.  I want to go back out with her.. but she doesn't know if she wants too and definately not yet..      Okay and for her and the ex boyfriend.. He basically treated her like crap and dated after they broke up.. And now that she dated me he got mad.. He basically wants to hold her off to the side, but he can still date and do whatever he wants.. I really don't want her to go back out with him because I have feelings for her and if she goes back out with him i'm sure they'll do more stuff like he wants and then in the end when he's done with her she'll be hurt even worse again..      Today we were talking and I kind of lost my temper and said that I shouldn't of gone for her in the first place because now she's even sadder and now she's mad at me and I feel like ****..       I reallly need help on what to say and what to do?  Please  help, I put some thought into this and I'd appreciate it if you did when you answered it.

20090222132733AAYniNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do men scream out of their car windows while i am walking?	Why do people... "particularly" men scream out of their cars while I am walking?   Can someone tell me why people. do this? I am on a college campus and there is a Brookshire's right across the street. Unfortunately I don't have a vehicle, so when I need something I will walk over there to pick up whatever item I need. Now as I was walking today I had several men scream at me as i was walking. Then on the way back I had some girls screams something at me. I don't know what they said, but why do people do this? Also as I was in brookshire's I noticed some females around my age staring at me. I expecting them to speak so smile and acknowlege them, but they just continue staring at me. What is up with this? Should I just give up on being a friendly person bc regardless of where I go people start at me like I am crazy and I am not loud or obnoxious nor do I wear anything that would draw attention. What is the explanation for this kind of behavior?
20090222142634AAoZa4E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think I have a chance?	This guy and I text a lot. He said he would ask me out when we hang (yesterday) and that he would kiss me then.   Well, we hung out yesterday for three hours and it was super fun. We tried to go bowling but the wait was 2 and a half hours so we decided to go to this shopping place with a movie theater. I rode with him there. I think we clicked really well. We listen to the same music, watch the same movies, get along perfect, and play the same sports. Once we got there, we decided to get a starbucks and walk around. We walked for a while then went back to his car. He held doors open for me too. When we got to his car, he was like"feel how cold my hands are" Then he held my hands for a tiny bit. After a while, we went to some nice restaurant, and he paid my way. Then, I had to leave so as I was getting out of the car he was like "hey can I have a hug" I leaned over to give him a hug and he held me for a moment and told me I smelt good. Toward the end of the date, i asked him if he still liked me. He said "your wild and crazy, I like you." and i was like "you can be honest." he said "I am I like you.   Then we were texting that night and I said "your hug made my day" and he said "next time lets try for a kiss." but since then he hasn't replied.   Do you think he likes me? (since he didnt kiss me or ask me out)   Does it seem like he likes me?   Advice      THANKS.

20090222135156AADqY1h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do with my ex?	I have known this girl for 3 years online. We have talked together for a total of 8000 hours, and we know each other very well. She came down to my state to visit often, and we dated quite a few times.   Me and her became best friends, and later boyfriend and girlfriend. We played numerous games together, and always made our account names the same so everyone would know that we were together. :)   After 3 years, I guess she kinda got tired or something and cheated on me. This devastated me, as 3 years of hopes and desires had betrayed me. I attempted suicide, didn't eat for 5 days, and had a hard time sleeping.. My dad took me to the emergency room.   A lot of people think I am totally psycho, but that's their opinion. I have talked to this girl so much, that I have grown to love and adore her. She is everything to me.   The news of her new boyfriend was devastating, but I've accepted it. I know that she is happy, and that has always been my ultimate goal for her.   Her dad told me that they were going to move to my state to get closer to his parents as they are getting ill.    She admits she still has feelings for me, and talks to me often. I think she is just confused. She is 17 years old, and hasn't really made plans for college.   I want to move on with other girls, but the good chance of her coming back really keeps my heart content. I know it will be hard for me to get back into a relationship with her, because my trust with her is almost gone. But I do understand why she did it, and I don't blame her.      What should I do? Should I just be friends with her and wait for something to happen?

20090222132410AAQq20T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! Girlfriend and thong underwear?	My girlfriend doesn't wear thong underwear. I really have a thing for thongs and bought her 5 thongs for $25 dollars from Victoria's Secret just for her to try. She was a little apprenhensive but I told her that if she just wore them for a while she would get used to them and eventually prefer them. Well today she turned the tables on me and bought me 3 4-packs of Joe Boxer Men's thongs and said "Since you like thongs so much you should wear them." She said she has no problem wearing a thong just as long as I'm wearing one as well, but the second mine comes off, hers comes off.       Should I take her up on this? Is she being fair or unreasonible? I kind of want to do it because she thinks she's one-upped me and doesn't think I have the balls to go through with it. I know if I cave she'll never let me hear the end of it. Plus I really want to see her in a thong.       I don't know if I can function with something permanently wedged between my buttcheeks all day though. Ha ha.  Sometimes just seeing a thong slip out the back of a girls pants (while sexy as hell) gives me a wedgie sensation.  Is the feeling really that bad, and if it is, any tips on how to adjust to it? Also, how long does it usually take girls to convert to thongs because she said I won't have to wear them once she "gets used to them" (using my words just to stick it back to me).
20090222165725AAoyh85	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would it be a wise choice to transfer college after freshmen year to marry a Marine stationed in NC?	I'm a 19yr old college student, He's a 19yr old Marine. We met when I was 17 and we've loved each other every since. He gets back from Iraq in April and we want to get married sometime this summer. Should we do it or wait? If we wait, then our relationship will be long distance. Which we've tried before. I live in GA and he is in NC. We are dying to be together. Education is very important to me and my parents. No matter what, I wanna finish school and he wants me to finish too! I love him so much and after a 7 month deployment, we just wanna be together!

20090222150702AAMHFsd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Isn't this so unrealistic?	My friend said she knows her boyfriend does not or would not cheat on her, because she said she always knows where he is when they are not together.  I say there is no way for sure to always know what a guy is up to and/or where he is.  I mean, a guy could step out of his house and cheat in one hour's time.  In my opinion, unless you hire a PI or are a detective yourself, there is no way of knowing for sure where someone is at all times, 24/7.      I also believe you can never trust anyone 100%.
20090222151750AAkxrqT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this typically a guy thing or not?	There is a guy at my uncles church that I've been having a crush on for about couple of months, but pissed me off with his funny acting attitude today. We've been aquainted long time ago and started seeing each other. Even though I felt that we had developed a close connection, there's times when he never calls me or barely texts, due to his excuse as being a very busy person, works alot, etc. What really pissed me off is when he brings this female friend to church and he starts to act funny when he sees me. He act like he can't speak or acknowledge me, and act like he's in a hurry to leave so i won't say anything to him. This is like the 2nd or 3rd time he acted like this, but I want to know why men act like that when they like a certain female.After church was over, I text him saying that he doesn't have to act like that when this girl comes to church. I don't know whether I should be mad about it, or just act like i don't care. Is this common in guys does this when there's another female acquaintance around? How would you guys react to this type of situation?

I think overall the date went well, but there were a few times where there was a sort of awkward silence when we ran out of things to say. we got food and then went for ice cream. at the end i gave her a hug and she said she had fun and give her a call. i text her 20 minutes later saying "i had a good time. i hope you did too. maybe we can do it again. good night" she text me back saying "hey thanks, i had a great time. get home safely" i want to go out with her again, i just hope she feels the same. i was planning on calling her tomorrow just to say hi. would it be alright if i said someting at the end of the conversation along the lines of hey, if youre interested, maybe we can get together again sometime. if she says yes, i will then say ok cool, well i will give you a call later and we can plan something out.

20090222134750AA7oGP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this chick like me anymore?	This girl and I have been hooking up sporadically for a little over a month. I slept over her house last sunday, last time I saw here was that monday. I called her later that day to see what she was doing later that night and she said she would call me back (she never did)      I just called this after noon (about a week later) to how her weekend was and what not (both of us were out of town). And, asked her if she wanted to hang out tonight. Conversation went pretty smoothly but, she was saying how she was going out to eat with her friend and did not know if she was going to be busy or not.       I thought it was weird that I didn't here from her for a week, and last week she said she was going to eat with her friend and i never heard from her. If she does not call back tonight should I just walk away? thanks
20090222150545AAidZEN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When a guy makes sexual jokes towards you,does it mean he likes you?	I have a crush on this guy that I work with. We always joke around and he always talk to me in a sexual manner. Sometimes we hug each other and I would like things to go further but I am too shy to make the move.      For example, today when we were working, I told him that I have to use the washroom and he was like “I would love to join you but since the manager is here, I would get into trouble because we are going to make some noises".      I was flattered but I don't know if he is really serious or just joking around.      I was thinking to ask him if he wants to come over to my apartment since I live alone but I am not sure if he is really serious about it. I don't want to get the wrong idea and make fool of myself .He is 18 and I am 23      Do you think he likes me or just playing around?

I recently gave my boyfriend my virginity,and it wasn't his first time,he has lots of experience.So like right after we had sex,he told me i was bad in bed and i was the worst he's had and he told me like about his ex girlfriends and how they were really good in bed,so i apologized for ruining it for him and told him i would try harder to be better.I didn't just lay there,but it hurt so much cause he wasn't really gentle cause he said he didn't like slow sex,i tried other positions but it hurt way too much.And when we have sex,he can't umm,stay up,and like he'll soften during sex,i thought maybe it had to do with stress or something so i asked him and he said no and told me that it's weird cause it never happened with his ex's and he said that it was because of me and because i'm not as sexy and i don't know how to turn him on,and i don't know how to keep him turned on.So my question is,how can i turn him on so it doesn't happen again

20090222150440AAPNtIU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 26 he is 32. Will it work?	I'm a college graduate, working on my Masters.  I work in a well known company, always looking for that next step to bigger, better things.  I own my own house, car and am independent and proud of it. My boyfriend is 6 years older than me, he lives at home so he can help his parents with the rent.  The thing is he never went to college, he works as a manager in a assembling line, he has been there for almost 10 years.  He doesn't want to go back to school.  What attracted me to him was his sensitivity, his charm and well, we get along great when we hang  out and stuff.  Now that I want to bring him in to my circle of friends at work am a little reluctant to do it, I'm afraid he won't fit in, but I want him to.  I do like him a lot, and now our relationship is getting to the "I love him," part, but I'm afraid that later on it won't work out.  What should I do? Has anyone dealt with this before?

20090222140004AAKPQce	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do in this situation?	Okay the guy I like and I were friends. I've been nothing but kind to him this past week. This past week I've just been telling him how sorry I am that he didn't get into his first choice high school. He danced with me at another party and it was fine. At a party this last Friday. I wanted to ask him to dance. One of our mutual friends tried to hook us up and he said he'd dance with me. For one song I asked if he wanted to dance and he said he would later. For the very last song I tapped on his shoulder and he literally ran away. WHAT SHOULD I DO!?! I am beyond mad because I have gone above and beyond for this guy especially this past week and then he just insults me, and embarasses me like that. Should I get revenge? Should I demand an apology? Letting it go is NOT an option. What he did was rude and mean and a LOT of people saw. What should I do?

20090222165820AA9dN2T	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should We Have A Shotgun Wedding?	I just found out a couple hours ago that I might be pregnant. I took a home pregnancy test and it came up positive but I'm going to take another one, then go to my doctor. My fiance had already put the money down for my engagement ring and we had already set a date for September of 2010. Of course, this puts a different spin on things.      1.) He's thinking about getting his money back and getting a smaller ring      2.) He wants to push the date back THREE YEARS! (Okay, we're not THAT broke. We're both 25 and working good full time  jobs). I told him I'd scale back on somethings or do it myself but he insists that we won't be able to save for anything).      3.) We're both worried about having a child out of wedlock because of our families and what we believe in our hearts, so we contemplated getting married at the courthouse right away, then having the big wedding later, just to be on our p's and q's.       If we do these things, will that make our day any less special?

20090222133816AAjWzQ3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he act like this?	I have been talking to this guy over the internet for about three months. He told me about his ex gf and I told him about the guy who was taking care of me but I did not like him. He said that we are just friends. So then, I asked him if it was okay just to say happy valentines day to that other guy. he said yes and even told me what to do... and yesterday we met for the first time. So we talked about other stuff and then he asked me if I have a bf. I said no. then he asked me about that other guy if he answered to the message and i said no. so then we talked a little more. it started to rain so i said that i will be leaving soon. he walked me to my car and stayed there as if he didnt want me to go. then when i came home i went to the site to see if he was there and she was. and guess what he told me? he said that he wanted to be just friends. I am so confused. why would he ever ask me if I have a bf then? Please help me???
20090222150935AA0F0Mb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please leave your quick advice. you guys are smart :)?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.
20090222135434AATBNiT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm concerned that my son has a secret girlfriend?	My 17-year-old son has been very secretive with me lately. Recently he has started to refuse to go to church with the family, and tonight, when I was going through his room, I found a magazine with naked men in it. He obviously has a girlfriend that he is hiding from me that bought that magazine into my home, and I am afraid they are having intercourse and I am greatly concerned that he is going to get her pregnant.      What should I do about this?
20090222144633AA4yPKE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he shy or just didn't like me enough?	What if you had this classmate whom you really really like but never really spoke too. He'd always stare at you. He would even peep at you behind a someone's back sometimes. He helped you when you needed a seat and he was the first to go up to you immediately after you drop your papers.      The last day of class was my bday. I at least expected him to greet me. After I had a picture with my group in class (our class was divided into two groups which we had to sign up for at the start of the year. He wasn't part of it). After the picture, his friends who were in my group immediately screamed "Happy Birthday Dianne!" But then he didn't say anything even if he was there and his friends said it. He was just staring at me. As if he didn't know me. The whole time he couldve left early but he chose to wait for his friends. Then while they were greeting me and I was thanking them he said "I'm just gonna go ahead." (in this voice that sounded either really nice or embarassed) Then he turned and left. That's the last of him! I mean a few hours before that we held eye contact for 3 seconds.We were less than a meter apart. And this eye contact was teh most painful I've ever felt. Maybe because it was the last day.maybe because I wanted to look away but couldn't. Maybe because my eyes couldn't stand staring at him without blinking. So now I need to know. Did he like me but was shy? Or did he not really like me as much as I thought he did so he left without really making a huge effort?]         Does it mean a big thing to greet a girl on her bday that he couldn't do it?         How can I forget him, I won't ever get the chance to talk to him again?

We both promised that we would wait for each other. A few months until he comes back.    So now he has changed his mind. He likes someone else now, that goes to my school.  He says hes over me and that i need to move on. And i know that i should move on, and get over him.   But its hard to because i never stopped liking him.      And okay, so i have a guy friend.    We don't hangout out of school or anything, but I do talk to him during school and actually have a class with him.   I know for sure that he likes me. But I'm not sure that i like him back.   I really want to, and I do really want a boyfriend right now. But im not sure how to know if I like him like that, or if i would ever want us to be more than just friends. Im just really not sure.       So, how can i know for sure if i like him?

20090222152327AApkBe6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do or think, please help?	okay so like a year ago i started to have a big crush on this guy. he was sorta my friend. more like an accuantence and it seemed like he liked me., lets call him "elroy".it was all fun first untill he start going out with this other girl in my school, lets call her "amber", who he really really liked, like he was creepily obsessed with her. this broke my heart, and made me very jelous and really really hate "amber". they only went out for like two weeks when she broke up with him on spring break while completely intoxicated at some party. he was really heart broken by this and by what ive heard, he cryed to her. yeah..and while all this was happening my feelings for him kept growing..stupidly i decided to tell some friends, which i shouldnt have. long story short word got out and people kept bothering him about it like sending him emails pretending to be me and asking him if he liked me..that i heard when ppl asked him he would say he didnt want to talk about it. this made me feel like a complete dumb ***. time went on and summer went by, still my intense feelings for "elroy" didnt pass. then rescently right before christmas break things seemed to really hit off with us so to speak...we were talking and having fun again and started hanging out sorta,, i became close friends with his best friend. and i could've sworn he said to me in kind of a shy quite voice"i got you somthing, b..but i left it at home" and i was kinda scared so i ended up giving him what might seem to be a dirty look. after christmas break i was haging out with his best friend lets call him "bert" and he mentioned casualy "elroy's"  new girfriend. i felt like crap. i dont knw what to do..i know this might sound stupid, but i think i might be in love with him. i cant imagine myself with anyone else. and im afraid i wont have a bf for long time again cuz i keep denying other boys because im living in this fantasy about "elroy"....i just want to move on...it hurts so bad, please give me some advise....what should i do??      there is way more details but its way too much to write....   i already wrote like an assay..lol   but this should explain it enough..

20090222164002AAK3iR6	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to talk about in college?	I kinda moved far away from my hometown during the transition to college and noticed I forgot what I used to talk about with my friends and close friends in high school. We used to talk about random things like movies, cars, life, relationships, school, etc. just stuff like that.      Now that I'm in college I feel so uncomfortable because I don't know what to talk about with people I just met. So I stick to school talk to relate with everyone, but I think that bores them lol. I just don't know what to talk about with people I don't know because I'm a natural talker and if I don't know them I just feel weird talking about stuff I don't know if they would be responsive to.      Can you guys tell me what you talk about to keep conversations interesting?

I don't know why I'm asking about this or really what I'm asking here...we have been going out for about 3 months she is very sweet but she has been really *itchy lately she whats to argue about stupid little things...I was just wondering what some other peoples thoughts would on this      this is what her page says          I'm Katie. I'm 18 years old and out of school now until I graduate on June 9th, 2009. Honestly, I don't miss high school at all, and I'm so glad to be out of all the drama. I've definitely found out who my "true" friends are; I've also realized who really matters and who never did. If I don't like you, you will know, no question about it. I have no time for your drama so keep it away from me and we'll be fine. Overall I'm a very friendly person, but I do have my limits, so I suggest you don't push them. Get to know me, I'll bet you have never met anyone quite like me; I'm worth getting to know.

20090222133831AARK4WR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WTF! HELP!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok, so there's this guy that I hang out with in my group of friends. We all hang out because we are all in speech. So whenever I see him, he makes all these sexual jokes like he wants to screw me, ect. I'm kind of known as the flirt in the group, but I don't have a boyfriend. I'm kind of the boyish girl in the group. But I definetly don't dress boyish, just act like some of the guys. So, he and I get along great, but he is in a little bit of the popular crowd at school, and I'm just average. He acts different around some people. Like at school he doesn't really flirt with me. But he always like touches me. But like last night, I had onions for dinner (I know I'm an ***) and he was like your breath smells bad, and he and I kind of banter back and forth. He also sometimes touches me like he like put his arm around me for like 1 minutes last night and was like massaging my shoulder, and like always steps on my heels in a joking way. Only 1 person I know says he likes me, because no one knows I like him, and I don't ask.I have no idea if I'm pretty or not, some of my girlfriends say I'm gorgoes, but then again they are friends. Haha so only a couple of guys and like adults and my friends say I'm pretty. He's a but of a flirt too, and it's wierd because right when he and I got tight, his gf and him broke up. I'm like outgoing and so is he. So what do you think, do you think he likes me? By the way we are both in high school. But we are like kind of hot and cold. Like sometimes at school, we hardly even talk but when we are out we are like super tight. What do you think-does he like me?

He is completely different o all the other guys I have been out with, and for the first time in a long time. I actually like him. Hence why I am stressing.          He took me for dinner last week. He drank so I took him home and in the car he said you are really busy next week arnt you? Text me and let me know when you are free. He text me later as well to say thank you for a great night. Now I left it for two days and text him today to see if he wanted to meet up again. But I have yet to hear anything.      The other day when I text him he didn't text back until really late on the night. (he is a footballer so he was playing late but dunno if that is me looking for a reason) Im just not sure... I dont want to start really liking this guy if it isn't going to work...      So guys... Should I worry and move on? Or just chill? I have heard that not all guys text much anyway... Im not going to keep texting him at all because I would hate it if it was the other way around lol.       Advice please. xx

I've only been talking to him for a week, but I really like him. We met through a girl that's friends with both of us, and she's in Year 10 as well.       I'm not sure he'll still talk to me when we're back at school, and I would go over and talk to him, but I think it'd seem a bit weird to all his friends/the Year 10's we met through.       Anyone got any suggestions on how I could get the chance to talk to him/hang out with him without seeming like a complete stalker/weirdo? lmao.      Thanks in advance.

20090222155950AALYUwN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she flirting with him? And if she is... Why?	Okay so before I got with my boyfriend my best friend liked him, and he liked her, and obviously I liked him too, and he liked me. So anyway, we got together back in January last year, but a couple of months later I noticed her flirting with him and I resented them being in the room together.      At first I thought it was just me thinking too far into it, so i dismissed it. Unfortunately just before Christmas a couple of friends of mine noticed it as well and mentioned it to me. At this point I realized that it wasn't in my head, and that obviously it had to be stopped.      I didn't see her until after Christmas at a party, where everybody was drunk and having a laugh, and I noticed her both getting really close and whispering in his ear and whatever, so I stormed off to the toilets and locked myself into a cubicle until my boyfriend came in asking what was wrong.      Anyway, I ended up telling her to pack it in because it was degrading for me, sitting there watching them, while everybody else was looking at me like are you going to let them do it... And she said yeah okay I'll stop.      But she hasn't. What am I supposed to do? She's my best friend, and he's my boyfriend. Why does she do it when she know's how serious we are? It makes me feel like crap...

It's too the point where it's just ridiculous.      Last night, my school had our Winter Formal. I felt great I looked great. I wore a scandalous dress. I mean everything was perfect. While I was there I danced but not as much as I could have. I just don't have the guts to approach a guy during a fast song and ask to dance.   (At my school it's the whole Bump and Grind on each other when were dancing and i'm fine with that.)      This is the first dance where I was gutsy enough to walk right up to the guy i've been crushing on and ask to dance during a slow-song, but I feel awkward asking ANY GUY to dance during fast-songs. I know I can dance, but at school fast songs seem like so much more than slow songs because were all over each-other. It got to the point where ALL my friends and girls that are in our little group were on a guy and I was the only one alone. I just walked off the floor, checked myself in the mirror in the Bathroom and when I got back I chilled at a table. I wasn't sitting there alone, but I wasn't with my friends. One of them noticed and asked me to come back on the dance floor but I refused.      How do I get past being shy, or feeling just Awkward?

20090222151351AAIoyep	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she just not that into him, anymore?	Ok, I have this friend named Malia and she's been dating my cousin Ben for a year and some odd months. Usually their up each others butts and all lovey dovey, but lately things have been a bit weird with her though. Here's how it all started about a month ago she came home complaining about how one of her friends was treating some guy(Mike) she worked with like crap(mind that she's been friends with that women for 4 years and just meet him) and the guy is oblivious to the fact that the girl messing around with another guy but it's not really messing around since they were supposed to be on a break. Well, Malia thought that was injustice to Mike so she took it upon herself to tell him all about it and get him to "break up" with her. Another twist is that Ben is not aloud to talk to other girls or even look with out her permission but she can do as she pleases; now she stays up til 2 am in the morning talking to him and texting as soon as she's off work. How strange right? On Valentines day instead of wanting to do something nice for Ben she wants to Drawl hearts all over Mikes car, give him a card and Skittles because she feels bad for him. Plus now all she ever talks about is Mike constantly! She even does her hair and puts on make-up just before work which she never has done before and calls him cute. She says their just friends and he gives her attention she needs, I think it's BS and she just wants MIKE!

For example, if he flirts with you because he knows you like him, or if he stares at you for what seems to be a long time because he knows that you like him and is happy that you like him, he's smiling at you much cos he knows that you like him and he's flattered, when you smile he can't stop smiling because he knows well, the guy I like he does these things but I don't know if he does it to make me happy.  he does tend to try and make me laugh. he's more friendly but he's never around me.

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now, and she has suddenly stopped going down on me. I know this is a strange question to ask, but I don't understand what has happened. I've talked to her about it and she just said "I don't know", went down on me that night, and hasn't since. That was about two months ago, and before that it was a lot longer. I keep myself clean down there, I've continued to go down on her regularly, and for the most part we have no other problems. She does a great job when she goes down there, so what should I do?

I asked out a guy I really like last week at school, and after I had asked him he looked really surprised and embarrassed. He turned me down, and I'm worried that he may have thought I wasn't being serious about asking him out, and he might have thought I did it as a joke! See cause the thing is, we don't really hang out with the same group of people, and he is really shy around girls. He just sort of looked kind of hurt or offended when I asked him. I thought it might have been that way so I tried to show that I was nervous and was being nice while I was asking him, but I'm still afraid he might have thought I was just joking! What should I do!

Here's the example:   If a guy tries to make you laugh and smiles big around you?   how interested is he generally? He seems a bit more quiet if it's just me and him (more serious and polite but still a big smile). Then when others are around, he'll joke and it seems like he tries to make me laugh. He also asks me a few questions about myself and seems interested in my answers. Is a guy like this interested or just enjoys my company. He has a bit smile on his face (where you see all teeth).       Is a guy who acts like this generally interested where they think about the girl a lot?    or do some nice guys act like this when NOT interested but just enjoy the company of a girl?

And last night we were texting and I said "yeah, I have no chance with you. em even said so" and he texted back "says who? don't listen to other people they don't know what i'm thinking lol" I ended up falling asleep. Woke up at 5 and I had unread texts. The one from him said "if i havent told u ur pretty funny and u make me smile. and i'm sorry about your leg i meant to hit dave but i have a bad arm lol" (he threw a lemon in the kitchen at work yesterday and it hit my leg instead of his friend) I have no idea if I'm wasting my time.. or if I possibly have a chance?

20090222132326AA1wqVW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He wants to go on a break and I wonder if it is going to work out! Help I'm really sad!?	My boyfriend and I have been going out for 9 months now and we are totally in love except for the fact that last night he decided he wants some time to think about things between us. I guess this is a break of some sort. I'm really confused and upset and need advise. We have been totally happy and never fought up until 2 weeks ago.    The details: 6 months of the relationship it has been long distance. He goes to optometry school in Chicago and I live in STL (He has 2 years left of school). I really love him and we have been seeing each other on the weekends every 2 weeks and for a full week every 2 months. We have basically no problems except the week before Valentines Day he was going through exams and we were both really stressed. It took it's toll on the relationship and I tended to get a little snippy with him. Also I had a couple jealous moments that didn't turn into fights but made him wonder if things were going to work.  I love him so much and he says he loves me as well. We kiss and laugh and even after he decided that he wants to think about things he was loving on me and being really sweet. I think we are perfect for each other minus the distance which I am willing to deal with. I love his family, he loves mine, we like the same things, he is so chivalrous and sweet and respectful...everything a girl would want. He is basically perfect. But he is scared that the distance is going to be too hard. He has 2 years left of school and I told him that I would move up there around November to be close to him and he said that makes him scared in case things don't work. We both want to have a healthy relationship that is as close to perfect as possible and we never want to have a divorce. I do completely trust him and he is the most genuine person that you will ever meet. He asked me to come up and visit him in 2 weeks for a Great Big Sea concert with his family and then invited me to a School Dance in a month but I'm wondering how I should handle that. I don't want to be that girl with the benefits. I don't want to lose him as my boyfriend and I don't know what to do. I was strong at first but now that we are apart I am a mess. I may be handling this really immaturely but I want to do the right thing.  What should I do? What does this mean? Please help.

Me and my boyfriend broke up the other day because we had a little argument, he broke up with me because I told him he has an anger problem and he said then why are you with me and i said that i dont know. Well I really want to be with him again and he says he does too but he has to think what he wants to do. He still thinks about past things i have done and always brings them up when we fight. He says he misses me and loves me but i don't feel the love from him like when we first went out. I always explain to him how i feel about him and he doesn't he says guys dont do that. Im just afraid he doesnt love me or are enough. He gets mad when I over think and ask him too many questions. Today he doesnt want to talk at all to see how it is without talkingto me a whole day. he says he misses me. We always go back out, get in a bad fight and break up again. I want him to be the one, i only see him in my life. I love him . I just hate fighting with him. hes my first real boyfriend of two years and i only want him. Im his first gf. Were both 19. What should I do? Should I still show to him how much i care and always explain my love to him even though he doesnt? or should I change and see if he notices?

Basically, he is insensitive, and I deserve better.  I don't think I'd be happier without him, but I'm miserable right now.

We chatted a little and I asked if we could meet up.  Messages back and forth were good.  I called and conversation was also good.  We set up a date and even emailed here and there.  When we went out on the date I thought it was great.  We had drinks and talked for almost 5 hours.  Laughs, jokes, personal stuff, etc.  The end of the night we hugged and she said "you better call me".        next day I text that I had a good time and i will call tomorrow.      I made the call and left a message... no return call yet.        Am I thinking too much of this or what?  The whole date she was very interested in what I do, who my friends are, ALOT of personal stuff and we laughed and joked all night.  I felt a connection.  She had all the body language signs of playing with her hair while talking, sitting towards me, fidgitting with stuff and touching her neck.      So now you all tell me....

20090222134934AAQezyv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why after so long do they both have to say they "love" me please help !!!?	Ok so this isn't really a question but suggestions would be nice, sorry if it's kind of long.      Right i have two really close boy mates both of which i have known between 5-6 years. Over the past 3-4 years i ended up getting very friendly with one of them, we dated for a bit but i felt it was too soon. He ended up dating someone else of which he is still with after over a year. But the past month we have started becoming very close like we was before i often go to his place and we tend to have a laugh, but i went last tuesday and he try ed to kiss me. Thank god i backed off but i couldn't help wondering if he really does have feelings for me again. I ended up asking him on wednesday and we had a good chat he told me he had never lost the feelings for me but felt he had to move on because i did. I understand where he is coming from but now i feel i am coming between him and his girlfriend, he said he wanted to leave her which makes me feel even worst. I don't understand why he has just came out with it after over a year but i don't think i can Truly get over him.      If that wont bad enough over the past 6-7 months i had been dating my other very close mate. we not long split up after both having a hard time with family members dieing we felt we needed space. A few weeks after we was having a drink and i tryed to talk to him about us but he said he had moved on and i should too. It took me a while to realise that we really was over but with my frineds helping me i knew i had to move on. This friday just gone it was his brithday and we had a party for him again we became very close but both had alot to drink. we was flirting all night and ended up kissing while stuck in the moment my bother walked in, that didnt really end well as my brother walked him home and told him to stay away from me. But i just can't seem to get him out my head we seen each other today and had a great time again we ended up kissing and we wasnt drunk this time lol.       So im kind of stuck i have feelings for them both the first one i feel like i have came between him and his girlfriend but at the same time i feel like i have finely got what i wanted after over 4 years, but i dont know if getting what i want is a good thing when i have strong feelings for this other boy i keep kissing but then i dont know if he ever wants to give us an other try. Maybe i should just give up with them both and try to move on altogether.       Any suggestions are welcome and i know some of you will think im messing them both about which is why i want to sort it out thank you for reading.

20090222140931AAmGfQM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if a girl doesn't want to hold hands?	I'm rather inexperienced in dating, so I need some advice.      I've gone on two dates with a girl whom I like, and I think she likes me. On the first date, she kept prolonging it (I was thinking of a fairly short date, but we ended up strolling around the city for a few hours), and she emailed me the next day to say it was fun. I am fairly shy, so I never did anything like take her hand and hold it. At the beginning of our second date tonight, I said to her that I want to hold hands and asked her if she wants to. She kind of smiled and giggled, but then refused. So now I'm rather confused. I think we had a good time again, and in fact are planning to meet again tomorrow (at an event we were planning on going to before), but I don't know what to make of this. Can anyone (especially girls) give me some advice?

20090222141507AA2lhLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she love me or is she just being nice?	Hello. It's nice to post on here. I do have a question that has bothered me for a while. I'll begin by saying that I've known a girl for about 4 years now. She's from a different religion than me... she's Muslim but I'm a Christian. I know that Muslims aren't allowed to date or marry Christians but we go to college together and we're friends.       Now, basically, she's been very sweet towards me. Sometimes she calls for no reason. Also, she stands pretty close to me... unlike anyone else I know.    I've also been sweet toward her, since I give her a ride whenever she wants.       I know this is a tough question but is there a way in God's world that I can find out if she's romantically interested in me or do I have to live with my misery forever?       Let me know what you think, and please don't say anything insulting.       Thank you!

20090222142747AAPoiPu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I get for my girlfriend when i go to Europe this summer?	Okay, I'm going to Europe this summer for 2 weeks. I would really like to get my girlfriend something when i travel there. I would love for her to have something from Europe that she knows I got for her while I was there. To show her that I was thinking of her the whole time i was gone. She told me that she wants shoes so that she can tell all her friends, "Yeah, my boyfriend got these shoes imported from Europe just for me." I think that is a pretty good idea, but I don't think shoes is the most romantic gift in the world. She would be expecting jewelry (much like a lot of girls that have a boyfriend, husband or significant other returning from a trip from somewhere far away), so I want to get her something special. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated...

20090222144736AA0vraX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does He like me,or is he just playing with me?	I'm 16 going on 17 and this guy just turned 18. I used to thinck he was creepy when he sat next to me in math class because he'd always say my name all weard (he said it right though) and every time he asked me a question he would lean really close to me (all up in my bubble). He poked me and made fun of me (in a good way) and he was really nice to me. So after all that I started liking him. I don't know why, it was just something about him that got me cought up. I found myself thinking about him every day, if I didn't see him at school I felt like my day was incomplete. One day my friend was playing arround and she asked him if he would marry me. He said yes. I was so confused and embarased at the same time. I stare at him every chance I can, and when we make eye contact I keep my eyes on him until he walks past me. I think he knows I like him, but the day before valentines day something weard happened. My friend almost pushed me into him whyle we were walking past him at his locker. So I caught myself and stood there next to him as if nothing had happened. Then He says "hi" and asks me if I needed anything and if I was ok. When he said this he got really close to my face. I was nervous so I told him not to bother me. On valentines day our school did this thing where we could send paper hearts to ppl with messages on them. He sent me one that said "hey there". I gave him a note saying thancks. When he responded to my note he said I didn't like him, and he didn't understand why I was mad at him. Now we don't talk to eachother. I miss his creepyness. Was he just playing with me, or is he for real?

20090222145229AAtbRD8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS ONLY! Checklist for overnight bag when visiting new boyfriend.?	I am attempting to compile a list of things that are needed when spending the night at my boyfriend's house.      I have already been in a relationship before which involved sleeping over, however as he lived so close I tended to never need to take a lot of stuff, and the stuff I did need was pretty much there if i needed it.      However, my newest boyfriend lives on average about an hour from my house, so it's not as easy to go home early in the mornings if i've forgotten something.   So I'm making this list to cover every eventuality, as I won't be coming home really early and would like to look and feel fresh the next day, possibly into mid-afternoon.      So far I have...   1. Change of Underwear   2. P.Js   3. Makeup, facial wipes etc.   4. Hairbrush/comb   5. Deodorant   6. Toothbrush      These are the basics, I'd like to hear any suggestions of things that will fit into a medium sized bag (as I don't want to look like I'm moving in and can't leave anything there.)      Even if it's silly, mention it, I want to consider everything.   Please also give reasons for the choice.      Thanks xx
20090222145447AAWU95m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who do i choose?? please help?	ok so, my situation is kinda complicated so I will try to explain as clearly as possible. guy 1 is my ex. we went together for a year, and then he broke up with me because he wasnt ready to be in a relationship. he started talking messing with other girls, neglecting me, and often being mean to me. but he wanted to continue talking to me, and i allowed it =/ so things were complicated with us. we argued a lot, but when we didnt argue things were great. he played mind games to get me to stay as well. he now claims that he is sorry for taking me for granted and hurting me.      well, after a while, i started not being able to deal with it. i started talking to other guys, and bad enough when i started actually realizing i didnt need to deal with it, he gave me a promise ring and said he will start getting things right. (i got the promise ring before i was showing signs of moving on) but by this time, i wasnt ready. i was scared of being in a relationship with him because he had hurt me, and i was also finally getting to accept the fact that i didnt need him. well, i did some things he didnt know about, but found out about later.      while he was finding these things out, i met a great guy 2. 2 is perfect, there is nothing wrong with him. im just not getting the same giddy feeling that i got with 1 when i first met him. i'm with 2 now, but 1 wants me back.      who do i choose?? the man (1) i love who i hurt and he hurt me too, who is willing to go to counseling? or (2), the man who is perfect, my feelings just arent as strong (yet?). ive only been with 2 for a couple months.      kind advice is greatly appreciated =)) thank you
20090222145519AAIOoVe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone help me with this impossible relationship?	This is a very complicated relationship. If anyone can give me some good advice I'm willing to use it. If it works, I'd be glad to give you a computer hug! I have a friend who I truly care about. We started a friendship the beginning of this school year and it has grown alot since. After a few months I had feelings for him and he knew. It didn't seem to matter and we became closer than ever! Well He said he had feelings for me and was considering me as a girlfriend. Then  one night he called me while i was well crazy drunk. He got upset and told me he had to win me back. then he started to hang around this other girl and it made me jealous. He said he doesn't like her as much as he likes me. (it still means he likes her!) we've gotten into fights every week since. 2 weeks ago i told him "i bet you wouldnt even care if i didnt talk to you." the next day he comes up to me at school and says "Tanya don't ever say that type of **** to me ever again!" then we hugged and everything was ok. but then we fought the next week. The fight last week was me telling him he needed space from me cause he needs to set his priorited. If he wants to go out with me ask me out already! I'm ready to be in a relationship with him but he's still busy juggling two girls. Soo i ignored him for about 3 days then he calls me and we just kinda let that pass.  Most of my friends think i deserve better and think he;s a jerk who doesnt respect me and stuff. I know they say it cause they care but sometimes i wonder if they just don't want me to be happy. anyways just today he calls me at 12 am in the morning to talk about nothing. He was at a friend's house and in the background he yelled "are you talking to anna(the other girl)?" I was furious! I got mad cause then afterwards he wouldn't talk to me. He was busy talking to his friend soo i'm like why the hell did you call me at 12 in the morning to talk about nothing? i sent him a text saying something along these lines. i'm not sure cause i deleted them afterwards:   You have some f-ing nerve to call me at 12am in the morning to talk about nothing while zach asks you if your talking to ana. this type of crap is why my friends talk crap about you and don't want me hanging around you. You need to evaluate yourself for the way you treated me. Don't ever say anything to me ever again. Its not like you care but enough is enough :) "       All morning i havent gotten any calls or texts from him since.     The other girl is moving away in 2 weeks. (thank goodness!)        What should i do now? Is he worth this? Am i over reacting? What do you think about this situation? Any advice I'm willing to take and use!       Thanks! Best advice 10 points!

Recently he has these online dating pages and I found out that he has been talking to other girls and some of the conversations had sexual comments in them. I confronted him about it and he said he was sorry and stupid and that it will never happen again (this was 1 week ago). I told him I didn't trust him and for him to delete the page. He said he would do whatever it takes to get my trust back and that he would, however now he doesn't want to delete his page.

20090222151356AAUvNJD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl being difficult, can you help me?!?!?!?!?	Alright this is a bit of a story so please bear with me, I would really appreciate the help.    Alright so right before I went back after Christmas break I started to talk to this girl that I'm really interested in we hit it off right away and it seemed like everything was working. So the last day of break I called her to see if she wanted to get a bite to eat, but she didn't answer. She ended up leaving me a message in my inbox on facebook saying how she has liked another guy for a while now and didn't want to rush into anything with me. I was pretty bummed and wanted to know who the guy was. I ended up finding out the guy which was horrible, because then I started comparing myself to him. However, I started to move on, and around the second week of Feb. I found out she was no longer interested in that guy, and this news just brought back all feelings I had for this girl. So even though before this news I had still continued to talk to her in the halls and still getting to know her. Well, she just happens to be good friends with my friends girlfriend and my friends girlfriend told me she had been asking about me alot lately. I now go in every morning to do "homework", but it's really just a chance I get to talk to her for 30 min just the 2 of us. However, I've started to wonder if she is just thinking of us as friends or if she is possibly thinking more. My friends all think she likes me and I really want to believe this, but I don't want to put myself out there again and get shot down. What do you guys think I should do?

At school I am very serious (but nice) and kind of a nerd, so I don't expect guys to pay much attention to me. Outside of school, I'm really shy and don't talk to guys much, but I've been told by some strangers that I am hot, pretty, etc.      So say a guy had a choice between an attractive, smart girl who is shy or a short and bigger but outgoing girl who is very bold and talkative, would he choose the second one? All I've heard is that guys go for whatever looks better, but all the time I see the contrary.      I've asked friends to help me in social situations (ex. group dating, setting me up with one of their guy friends), but they refuse to and are too absorbed in their own existent love lives. What should I do to meet some nice guys/is there any hope for me at all?

She said, that she worked part time at a night club and she suggested that I go and check it out.  I said, okay.  She also said, there's another club that she likes to go on Thursdays.  She invited me and she said, that she will introduce me to one of her friends.  I asked about her boyfriend and she said, he would stay home.  She added that she would like to get to know me.  Confusing.  I saw her last night at the club and we talked.  She paid attention to me and I told her that she was pretty and she said, thanks.  I invited her out to lunch next week and she said, that she had to think what day she would be available.  Seconds later she said, that if her boyfriend let her go she would have lunch with me.  I just feel we connect.  What is she thinking or is she lying about her boyfriend?

20090222163122AAXWCMH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I truely love her?	We dated for a year, when she was 15 and I was 16. Then I broke up with her, because I didn't know what I wanted. I was scared that I was making a mistake by staying with the first girl I ever got into a serious relationship with. A year and a half has passed. I still love her just as much. I haven't dated anyone else. I've messed around with girls, it was fun at the time, but it didn't mean anything, it didn't DO anything for me ya know? It wasn't like with my ex girfriend. It was special with her. This whole time she has wanted me back but I told her I couldn't do it. I told her I needed to be single, and on my own. But now that she is moving on, (i'm almost 19, she's almost 18) and talking to this guy, I'm finally hurting. Hurting really, really bad. For the past three days, I've slept so much. I didn't get out of bed yesterday until 5 or 6 pm. Then I went to sleep at 12 that night. And I havent ate much. My question is, am I just jealous of her talking to a guy, or do I really love her? I'm afraid of dating, because I get controlling because I don't want her meeting guys, and maybe falling for them. I don't know what to do, I don't feel the same (and don't think I ever could) about any other girls, no matter how beautiful they are.
20090222164146AAFBd2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel really bad about this.?	Me and my assistant manager have been flirting alot over the past few months, he's married with 2 kids but is the one coming on to me. anyway he always asks me to kiss him and like an idiot i do, i know i shouldnt but i cant help it.  we were in work and a customer was at the bar talking and he was trying to subtly get rid of him to leave the two of us, the kiss led to his wondering hands then sex. i feel awful for cheating but my feelings for him are getting stronger. i dont plan on ruining his marriage by telling people, no way, if anybody was to find out it would ALL end in disaster. i cant stop thinking about him, theres a 10 year gap (im 18) we've kissed lots and had sex twice.. the second time gave us a scare (wont go in to detail...) and since then he's asked to kiss me but when we had the opportunity to tonight he never.   what should i do?   please no rude comments i know im wrong for what im doing but i cant help how i feel please understand that.      :)

20090222165635AAUQN6D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need some relationship advice about a girl I fancy, what is she thinking?	So to introduce myself, I'm 23 and living in the UK. I belong to an ethnic minority which has only around 300,000 community members in the UK, that's not enough that everyone knows everybody but enough that you'll always have loads of friends in common with someone new you meet your age.      For cultural reasons I'm only really interested in dating girls who belong to the same ethnic minority as me. There are also a lot of things I'm looking for in a girl and this has severly limited my experience of relationships, I've just not yet found anyone who I'm really attracted to and is attracted to me. That's why when i do find someone I like its important not to give up to easily.      Whilst I was backpacking alone in Australia over the summer I met a pair of girls. Before even speaking to them I found one particularly physically attractive. When we got chatting i found out she was also from the uk and also belonged to the same ethnic minority as me, in fact we had loads in common and she was pretty much perfect for me.      We got along great and travelled together for about two weeks togther with her friend. Since we had loads of friends in common and knew that we would probably meet again (and infact had probably met before!) we decidided to stay in touch. Over the next few months a txted and facebooked her ocassionaly and we seemed to be getting on great. From what I knew about her she was similar to me in that she remained single because she seemed to be waiting for the right person. I was pretty sure that she was interested in me, she kept reporting back to me what our mutual friends had said about me as though she wanted to know if I was generally considered a nice guy and then wanted to let me know that shed found out that I was. I personally find it difficult to be flirty so I'm not sure if I gave out any signals of interest during out travelling times. She is the kind of girl who likes to be very friendly with everyone but also doesn't seem to give out any signals.      After having been back in the UK fro 4-5 months we finally met up at a big drinking event for our community. So we were both there with all our friends and our mutual friends. I had decided in advance that I was going to use that opportunity to make a move but by the end of the night it just hadn't happened, probably due to my lack of ability to declare interest through flirting and not knowing exactly where i stood.       Later on in the week, knowing that I probably won't bump in to her again for another few months I decided it was now or never. I called her up and asked her to go on a date that weekend. I'm terrible on the phone, even chatting with my friend so I just went straight in and asked her rather nervously. The request seemed to catch her by suprise but she said yes and said that I should call back later in the week to finalise plans for the weekend.      This is where things turned bad. I kept callin her all week but she refused to answer the phone or respond to my txts. In the past she had been difficult to get hold of but always got back to me later. I realised that she didn't want to speak to me i guess cos she was too embarrassed or didn't know how to let me down. This all happened about 3 months ago and I haven't heard from her since. I don't really know how and if I should contact her again with out it being incredibly awkward. I'm really annoyed at her for not dealing with it maturly and just ignoring the situation but I do still like her.      After a more recent experience where I had a brief realtionship with a girl who was really into me but I only had minor feeling for I began thinking about things from her point of view. I've been trying to think about what shes thinking, did she do this to me beacuse she was completly unintersted and was shocked that i'd even asked? That srikes me as strange beacuse I know that at least with boys, everytime we meet a girl we consider if shed make good girlfriend material, surely she's at least briefly considered the possibilty. But then again what if she hadn't, in that case I didn't really give her an oppurtunity to think about. She got scared having to make a quick decision and I didn't allow her any time to think about things.      I wanna know what everyone thinks I should do now. Perhaps now that shes had some time and the seed has been planted she has considered the possibility of a relationship between us more. The problems is I don't know how I should get back in contact with her, we've not processed the events between us. And if I do contact her how do I make sure that it is spoken about and that we don't just go back to the pre telephone call platonic friendly txting realtionship and just pretend nothing ever happend. I don't want that.      I feel like a lot of people might respond saying that I should just tell her how I feel but without knowing if there is any reciprocal feelings I'd find it difficult not to scar the hell out of her again. How do I know what shes thinking and if
20090222165641AAuPrYK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I get my husband off my back?	I'm pregnant and have had baby on the brain. So, I haven't been getting all my work done. I feel so judged by my husband, he always gives me a hard time for not getting my it done. I'm not talking about housework, the house is always immaculate. I'm talking about my full time job. I always have work to do at home after work and on the weekends.   Well, if he's gone playing all day on the weekend, comes home, he asks me, so what did you do? And, if I say that relaxed and did the dishes, he expects more, and gives me a hard time for staying up late and doing my work, instead of doing it during the day.   He also tells me all the things he's gotten done, mostly having to do with fun stuff, he doesn't ever have work he has to do at home because his job is way easier.   I feel like he gets this from his dad because his dad is overly judgemental of his mother as well. My husband's criticism makes me want to leave the house before he gets home so I won't have to deal with his comments and judgement.   I get enough judgement at work and I'm stressed, how do I get my husband off my back before I go crazy and go to my parents to avoid his criticism?
20090222165652AAtbIy9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding cost and expenses question about family travel?	We are really starting to budget and plan our wedding and we are looking at a budget of about 10,000 dollar which we are paying ourselves, no family contributions. We are going to be borrowing money to pay for the wedding which I'm kinda ok with and kinda not ok with. Now on top of borrowing money, my fiance wants to help pay for the hotel and travel expenses for his family. We have given everyone about 10 months notice of the wedding, plenty of time to save for a trip. I completely feel as though we are already putting so much money into this it should be up to guests to pay there own way. After all the wedding expenses are said and done we will not have ability to be handing out money to guests. Neither of our families have a lot of money but I really feel as though 10 months is plenty of time to save for a short trip. Is it normal to pay for someone to attend your wedding? Am I just being a b*tch by not wanting to put extra money that we do not have, into something people should pay for themselves? (Honestly I think his family can afford it without a problem, I think he feels guilty asking people to travel 900 miles to our wedding.) I feel as though we are having to pay them to come to the wedding. Is it wrong to tell people that we'd rather have them attend than send a gift if it comes down to one or the other? Any advise or past experiences would be great. Do you agree or disagree and why?

20090222123416AACuNxy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he making me so horny?	my guy friend who is also my ex-boyfriend has been making me horny lately and making me "want" him really bad. one time he told me he has the balls i'll never get from anyone because i told him he was scared and didnt have the balls to try some sport. he said he would show me. he also talked about how his dick is big and how everything people said about it is true. now that made me go insane and now he's got me thinking about his dick. he also calls me hot and says "your welcome my lady" and flirts with me. when we were texting he asked me "what do you wear and watch when you're alone?" he also is rude and cocky sometimes which really turns me on for some odd reson. he never said or did stuff like this to me before. he's making me really really want him but my friends keep saying i shouldnt be with him because he's bad. he asked me to be friends with benefits. It's weird because i'm not sure if i like him. i just really "want" him so bad that it's not funny. that's why im not sure if i would get back together with him because i broke up with him because i didnt like him that way.   i'm just wondering if he knows that he's doing this to me. he is like a big perv and everyone says that but he won't admit to me that he is so sometimes he seems clueless but i dont know if it's an act or something.   what should i do before i end up saying or doing something i might regret? this is starting to get bad.

20090222171051AABtKz0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this person abusive?	Someone in my life is very nice to other people, but is contemptuous and raises his voice automatically when he's involved working on a project. Even if he has asked for my help, he gets impatient and sarcastic with me. He says that he doesn't mean anything by it but I'm ready to cut him out of my life. I don't treat him this way. I don't believe he should treat his family this way either. His children try to avoid riling him (easy to do). He's never once raised a hand to me in the 26 years I've known him but his loud voice and sarcastic manner make some of his grown children afraid to talk to him. He refuses to pick up the phone so I can never get in touch with him during the day, but he knows where I am and will call me at work to ask questions about the computer. His usual method of talking to me is sarcastic and snide. Am I wrong to think that this behavior is abusive?
20090222145412AAZJyOK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was I Wrong, Or Is He Overreacting - How Can I Make This Right?	There's this girl I used to be best friends with, but I stopped talking to her cause I think she's a *****. She's always talking crap about me to my boyfriend, and it gets me annoyed that she's talking badly about me to MY boyfriend. I told him how frustrated it makes me to know that they talk, and he gave me advice saying "Oh, just lose all contact with her. Block her, don't talk to her."   So today is my birthday, and I get a phone call from her, so I was wondered what she wanted, and I picked up. I figured she was just trying to be nice and wish me a happy birthday, ok, it's not like I'm having a conversation with her, no big deal. Which she did, all she said was "Happy birthday." So I thanked her and hung up.      She just told my boyfriend "I spoke to her on the phone, she sounded like a man." Now my boyfriends pissed at me because I ignored his advice, and enabled her to contact me. He was like "Wtf, does my advice go through one ear and out the other? I care so much, that I don't want you to have any problems, big or small, cause small things can build up, so what's the point of me wasting my breath trying to help you, if you're just gonna ignore what I tell you? Whatever, you want me to care less? Fine, wish granted. I'm not gonna offer you advice unless you desperatley need it."      He's also upset because he's already really mad about work, and this situation is just making it worse.      Wtf, what should I say/do?

20090222122640AAiwtXy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	NEW BOYFRIEND. Any advice going??? Guys AND girls please (:?	Hi, please dont be insulting or offensive or sarcastic or anything, I just want to know if everything is normal.   Im 17 and Ive been going out with my first ever boyfriend for 2 and a half months now. Hes my age. Firstly, Ive always wanted one of those relationships where you like know everything about each other down to the last little details and where you are comfortable around one another, each others family, can freely go round each others houses without ringing up in advance, and all that type of thing. We get on really well and stuff, but I wouldnt say we are exactly like that. And also its his birthday soon, but I havent got a clue what to get him as in something that he would genuinely like thats whats to do with what he likes. Would you say its because we havent been together all that long? My friend has been with her boyfriend for 6 months and they know each other inside out. Will it just take time, or will it never happen for me and my boyfriend?   Also, I really like him, like really really like him, ( I would say love but I would probably get a oad of grief as in 'im too young, it has only been a few months, but just so you get the idea that im not merely with him for the sake of having a boyfriend)  but i still look at other guys and wonder what it would be like if I was with them. Is this wrong of me? I dont have feelings for them, i just think what it would be like.   His best friend always tells me he doubts we will last and gives me loads of grief, but then he hasnt ever had a girlfriend before.    Am I a bad girlfriend? Please help me. Im not sure what Im asking, im just looking for a little reassurance on the dating game. Any advice, previous experience, or anything nice would be appreciated :)   Thankyou (:
20090222171150AAcL1xc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A question for the Women!?	Well, long story short, my husband and I had a baby together, and she's now 8 months old. My husband's NEVER fed her, NEVER changed her, NEVER played with her, and he's only held her like 4 times, just because I was busy or something...He's at the gym a lot (10 hours a day 6 days a week) because he's a boxer, he doesn't have a job(doesn't have to work, my father pays our bills),,and he hangs out with his friends a lot. I know he's not cheating on me, but it makes me feel kind of bad that he doesn't have much interest in his daughter...Are all men like this? I really don't want my daughter to have a bad relation ship with her father growing up.. Does anyone know how I could get my husband to care about his daughter? I think he's pretty immature for an 18 year old(I'm 24)...I don't know if I should leave him or try to work things out...   Thanks for your input!
20090222172634AAoivbo	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my dads crazy gf?	So my dads been living with this girl for a few years so far, and I'm starting to think enough is enough. So shes seriously so wired, so I go to my dads place on weekends sometimes and OK all she does is stay in her room and complain I'm not even kidding its so annoying, and whenever she does come out she just starts an argument with my dad. Then she finally got a decent job, but before she couldn't keep one for more then 2 months. Like I basically mostly hate, her, but within the last year, I've just learned to deal with her and respect her.    Shes always negative and doesn't have any friends so she depends on my dad all the time for almost everything, and she barely pays her rent, then she complains about useless stuff.    The big thing is that I don't even think they like each other any more, or idk shes more my dads mental room mate then a girlfriend to him.    Well I want to check her into a mental institute, but idk how to, so what should I do about this whole issue that's been going on, I'm getting tired of every time I go over there that they are fighting.
20090222163946AA9mnfs	Family & Relationships;Family	Does my dad even love me anymore... im crushed.?	My dad and i used to have a really really good relationship. We had the perfect family, and the perfect life... until more kids were born, my mom got crazy and abusive, he got a new workplace on 20 acres of peacefulness in the coutnry where he doesnt have to deal with his kids, and he got stressed out financially.        I used to hug and kiss him goodnight every night. He would always tell me he loves me, take me places, watch movies with me, all of that. He's always been my comfort blanket, but then things around my house started getting bad, he got his own business in the coutnry so hes there everyday from 5 in the morning to 7:30 at night building things, doing business, planting, he never stops. and then he gets home and either watches a fight between my mom and my brother or me and my mom , or he watches movies with my brothers. Im depressed all the time so i usualy just sit in my room, and if he comes in, it's usually about what i did wrong today and what i need to do or how i should clean my room. and if i yel at him he says "sarah i barely ever see you get out of your room, if you want to spend time with me just tell me and ill do something with you" but when it comes down to it he doesnt. There's one thing we do every year... we go to this animal auction, and i have great memories, and i love it their with my dad, its tthe only time we spend alone time with eachother. But this year he said he doenst want to go, hes too busy working, and he needs the animals for the barn so he might bring some home. He never comes and says goodnight or I love you anymore, and he never really acknowledges me. everytime i try to talk hes too distracted by something. The thing is he treats me like his favorite. whenever im crying he comes and tries to comfort me, and says how much he loves me and he wants the best in life for me, and he tries to spend time with his kids. whenever my mom abuses me he gets mad at her, or if my brother and i get in a fight hes always on my side "most of the time it is his fault tho" ... but my dad doesnt understand anything. how the only reason im living right now is to go to that animal auction, and he says the day of the auction is the day he was going to have the annual opening for his business and i said cant you just change it and he said no its for the customers and i said what about me? and i just ran upstairs crying. He cares about his customers more than me, and he loves his job and he spends as much time as he can there. I dont know if he really loves me anymore. I always tell him how predictable he his and how he never surprises me, and last year he did, but he nevr does that much. its just i used to be daddys little girl and i dont know what happened to that. He loves work over me and hed rather sit at home watching moveis than take me shopping or to do somehting i really like. i miss him :(

20090222183405AAcmksb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	QUESTION FOR THE SHY GIRLS, would you act like this around a guy you like?	There's a girl that I have a crush on right now. I've never spoken to her, but we've had some of the same classes at college and I'm pretty sure she's shy and I think that she's never had a boyfriend(even though she's gorgeous). But anyways, whenever I've seen her when we workout at the same place on campus, in class, or in a store I've noticed that she seems to try to avoid looking at me when I'm looking in her direction, but only when I pass do I catch her looking quickly at me. So if your a shy girl do you purposely look away from a guy that you find attractive if you think he's gonna notice you checking him out?

20090222171418AAKHAd5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In this situation who is in the wrong? I need some insight plz...?	I was at the gym and my boyfriend texted me at 6pm.. "Leave the gym were going to Savannah(which is 30 mins away), we need to be there by 7.". I told him that it was impossible for me to be ready and be there by 7 literally. He got upset and said to just nevermind he will cancel our plans! He also said that he will never do anything spontaneous for us again!. Come on I told him, how fair was that to me? it didnt have any logic to it. We would have to leave by 630 and I was still at the gym at 6 and STILL needed to shower and get ready! I tried to explain things to him and he was just being sarcastic and I hung up on him. I got really hurt and upset. Was I wrong to? I still havent talked to him. Its not the fact that I didnt want to do anything spontaneous..I just wish he would of told me something before i went to the gym...someone please give me some insight on this situation. Who is to apologize? Thanks...
20090222133122AA30hn4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl. why do i feel guilty?	i like a girl that is a strip club waitress(fully clothed). we have been friends at her job for 2 months. she finally agreed to see me outside of that place because she thinks im a good guy. i always turn down the dances. i also have a friend that is a stripper. i went to the VIP room with her on the day the waitress was off. the stripper put my hands all over her which is against the rules. she said "are we going upstairs because she's not here?" i said "yep" she laughed at me. then she made me go a second time and promise to be more touchy feely or she would tell the waitress. so i went upstairs with her again. however the stripper told another stripper who is best friends with the waitress what happened. the other stripper told me she will not tell the waitress because im a good guy and she doesnt want to ruin things for me. but im not dating the waitress so why do i feel guilty?

20090222160147AAEeIUP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I truly love myself if I don't know who I am?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself.   But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..??

20090222131657AAxBZ4x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm so confused...I know I shouldn't but I want to wish my ex a Happy Birthday...Will he find it weird?	So I went out with this guy for six weeks from October to December (I know I know not long at all) but anyway I got pretty close to him during that time...We spoke online all the time and met each others families etc...But then he broke up with me and said we'd still be friends...Well, I haven't spoken to him for almost 3 months and I still miss him a lot...He dated someone else since he left me and I'm not sure if he's with anyone at the moment but I still would really like to be friends with him...Even when we were dating I thought of him as more of a friend anyway!      So his birthday is tomorrow and I'm deliberating over whether to wish him a happy one or not...I hoped he would come online (MSN) so I could casually say "happy birthday for tomorrow" but he hasn't...So texting is my only other option, but how would you feel if an ex said this to you...Would it be too weird? Do you think he'd be happy or annoyed? I just know this is my only chance to clear the air and let him know we're cool because he's leaving the country soon :(      My other option is to wait until he comes online after his birthday and say something like "happy birthday for last monday". What do you suggest? I just want my friend back...I know we can never be close again but this is the type of guy who isn't deliberately nasty to anyone and he'd prefer peace to conflict anyday.

My husband and I have tried marriage counseling but the connection that a married couple is suppose to have just isn't' there, and it never really was. We have been married for 7 years and together for 10 years. We married I think because we had our daughter and it was the right thing to do. Has anyone ever felt this way? and If so is it normal or should I look for an exit?

20090222182233AADR82i	Family & Relationships;Friends	My band are confused?	Basically we had a singer and he was pretty bad. Loads of our fans had passed a comment at a gig or chanted things at him saying he was bad. Lots of people wanted him out, so we made our desicion straight after a gig when the embaressment got too bad. We kicked him out. About 2 hours later the word spread to hundreds of people, and allot of them gave us abuse for kicking him out, even though we did it nicely.  And im not kidding, loads of people gave abuse. But then another strange thing happened, these people started congratulating us when we were face to face.      Does anyone have any idea what the **** is going on?

20090222150857AA7FGw9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I doing it all wrong?	Well, I seem to open myself up more to those around me, especially my girlfriend. I talk about how I hate myself and etc. I don't try to make myself look good or brag about my abilities around others. I guess its because everyone teaches to not brag, so I took that to heart, and instead I point out my flaws.      But, it seems that, when I open myself up and try to relate to others, they just take advantage of me, and turn on me, trying to impress the masses.      Or, in the case of my girlfriend, I have the feeling that she doesn't like me any more. I don't know if it is because I am like that or what. I feel like I can confide in her everything bad that I've done, and how I feel about myself. But she doesn't do the same for me.      And I try to help her when she has problems, but I can never think of the right things to say. I want to help her, but I don't know how. And I barely get to see her because of living in separate school districts and being separated by a bridge, which is bad since I communicate better through actions and touch than I do through words      Wow, sorry I'm just rambling... but I want to make everything right again, to how I used to know it... if anybody got through to the end of this, do you have any suggestions or advise? I just want her to totally love me again....

She's nice, she's intelligent, and a good conversationalist.  But am I shallow to not continue a relationship with her if the future looks bleak?      Don't give me the answer that maybe I can change her.  No one can change anyone.  If she's not taking care of her health and fitness now, I am not going to try to make her do it.

When a husband and a wife are in the process of getting a divorce, is it necessary to actually go to a judge in a court-room and explain the reason for the divorce and other essential information, or is it possible to get divorced by simply filling out a bunch of paperwork and then sending it in the mail?

20090222132210AAs6jCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To horny to function in society?	I'm 16 years old and in the 10th grade. Ever since about 7th grade I have had the uncontrollable urge to masturbate. I would go to the bathroom during school it would get so bad. Anyways I have this problem with being too horny all the time and not being able to concentrate. I was able to get away with this and still have a 4.2 gpa in grades 7-9 because they were easy, but now I am taking some hard classes, and when I get horny I can't focus on taking notes. I think the problem is that too many girls get me really turned on.... Like I guess I am not very picky. Like if A girl has an average/ semi ugly face and a hot body that gets me really turned on, or if she has An good face but really ugly body that also gets me really turned on. Heck, there are some girls that get me horny that only have like average looking faces but are fairly chubby... And thats only girls who are not that attractive!!!! Imagine how aroused I get when I see girls who look like Jessica alba.... My questions are   1) how Can I control this during school? Because recently in most of my classes my seat was moved to the back and This gave me the opportunity to masturbate during class (and yes I realize how disgusting that is... But I just can't seem to resist the urge)      2) Will my uncontrollable horniness go away as I finish up puberty? I am pretty sure I am not done yet because I like no facial hair yet, the only colored facial hair I grow is on my upper lip and it is not that thick and can only be seen when You are close to me, all my other facial hair is just peach fuzz.          This is really starting to bug me, and it makes me feel disgusted with myself.

She is in to crack, pot and drinks alcohol all the time. She cheats on him all the time. She is a complete *********- to him all the time but he still goes back to her. She is a gorgeous girl but she is a horrible person. She makes him cry all the time and she calls him ugly and disgusting. She even went as far as sleeping with his sisters boyfriend (he is friends with my cousin) and she also slept with his half brother... HE STILL PUTS UP WITH IT. This has been going on for about 2 years now but for the last few months she has become horrible with this (those two incedents happened with in a couple weeks of eachother). I have been trying to convince him to break up with her but he says he cant he's in love with her. She always tells him shes sorry and he forgives her.... He gives her money all the time to buy her cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, etc.. he is just so stupid when it comes to her. She also has a 7 month old son with someone else. She always tells him how fat he is and how he doesnt deserve her and he is too ugly to be with her but then she apologized!! only because he gives her money and she refuses to let him move on! this is killing me because he deserves so much better!! How can i convince him to get this tramp out of his life??! It's not like he doesnt know about it. HE CAUGHT HER IN BED WITH ANOTHER MAN MORE THAN ONCE (even once with his half brother!!)

I finally left the school after visiting a hospital because i had wanted to kill myself. Now, 3 years later, some of those kids are trying to contact me via facebook.

Okay, my dad is like the nicest guy you could meet, but he always goes down to our garage in the dark, in a corner, and stands on a bucket. I know this because i've walked in and i've seen him. My mom and me joke about it sometimes and say hes a stalker, but if you stand where he stands there is NOTHING to see. My mom just walked in on him tonight and said he was standing on the bucket with a rag in his hand, she asked him what he was doing and he said 'oh, i just needed to get some air i felt like i was gonna puke.' What the heck? (your getting air in the garage, on a bucket, in the pitch black, with all doors closed?)

20090222172017AAdXyhe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is a woman like me to do?	If my husband died tonight I would never know if he ever really loved me. Two decades together doesn't always mean what it would appear. Maybe it's me who doesn't love him the way I so much want to feel loved. I don't know anymore. Our marriage hasn't always been the best, ( felt like the best at times though)   It hasn't always been the worst either, ( has felt like the worst at times though) It has honestly been like a roller coaster. He is a decent man I guess, everyone else likes him well. I used to feel the same way about him. Truth is, I don't think I actually like him (his ways) anymore. I admit I have had much abuse from him...be it verbal, physical (not recently) and emotional as well. I know he has been unfaithful to me more than once, left me and our children, more than once...seems that he thinks it's okay to come and go out of our home (long periods, as long as a month) whenever it's convenient for him/ there's been an argument and he can blame me for his leaving. I wouldn't continue to take him back as I always do but I am insecure. I worry I wouldn't be able to provide for me and the children without his help. I worry that if I don't continue on this roller coaster with him then I might cause more hardship for the kids and me than we already know. I feel so worthless, unimportant, unproductive, ugly, old (I'm 44) and hopeless at times. My only sight of some relief and joy will be when my children are grown and sufficient of themselves so that I won't have to worry about any consequences I might bring to them for parting with their dad. Although at times I feel he is good enough to me, more often than not he can be very insensitive, hurtful and mean to me. I wish so much that I was worth the kind of love that some women feel from their husbands. I don't know if I am loved or appreciated at all. If it weren't for being trapped, I'd willingly leave him once and for all .....completely empty handed, I think I'd be happier as a vagabond than the way I feel at this very moment.

20090222112843AAwDyze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you had good enough communication would you be able to maintain along distance relationship?

Now my girlfriend lives in the US and I live in the UK obviously, if we ever have a problem we can always text, ring, email, IM or even post letters to each other, we have good communication with each others friends and family and God forbid anything happened to me or Elvira we'd know within a day or so and we are hoping to meet up soon but money is obviously an issue.

20090222133523AAerDEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I already know, but just need some objective criticism...?	I asked a girl to marry me a year ago.  She was through a bad divorce, child issues, medical problems and I stayed beside her through all of it.        I dealt with a huge amount of negativity; she started to confide in an old flame and ignored me and my support.  I waited through that, but it hurt.       I helped her move into a house that we both live in and remodeled it completely...redone the kitchen, bath, finish the basement, installed windows and a new roof, and paint throughout.  I've worked 'til I can't move, and I still did laundry and meals.        I worshiped the ground she walked on and I just wanted to make her happy.  We haven't had sex for months and she says she's beyond that (wtf?) , and recently she's been telling me that I'm not there for her.      She's told me she doesn't want me to leave, but the truck is backed up to the front door and ready to be loaded.      Should I load it up, leave, and count it as a life experience, or do I stay and see if the "old" her comes back?

I beieve you can have strong feelings towards friends of such. But would it explain these feelings I have for this friend.       I got introduced to this guy that someone knew. At first I felt he was a little socially awkward. over time (1.5 years) I began to get close to him. But now I feel a strong emotional love for him. We get along so well. we do lots together and enjoy listening to what he has to say. I have never felt this way at all towards a friend. Crap load in common and I see a lot of him in mean.      But are these normal feelings. There are times I imagine myself sitting next to him either holding his hand or arm around him. Strange eh. Are these normal feelings. (holding hands, arms around) Is it a mental disorder.

20090222182755AA84lvR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do many Asian Women in America discriminate Latinos because of fact that many of us are Poor and...?	and we dont have great High Tech jobs and careers.    Many Latinos are immigrants OR from immigrant parents and some of us, including me, we still live poor and we still look hispanic unlike some other hispanics that can speak English perfectly and can blend in with other Americans.      i'm American but i'm shy . Shy + Latino + Don't have and have never had friends = i dont speak well( any language) and I dont sound or look like typical Americans. I'm shy so that's another reason I'm poor and i dont have a good job even though I went to College. College really doesn't help if you're shy(very) and depressed.      Anyways, I like Asian Women but everytime i see them, i feel they really hate me and that they think i'm a useless bunch of c**p.   Moreoever, i've visited many Asian Forums, and the Asians are always bragging about their careers and education, and they've always said how they prefer Asians and the whole "Asian power" and think mexicans and latinos are stupid.      So, i feel Asian women hate me even though they don't say it to my face.      What's yur take?   i'm 29 male.. AND i have moustache

Today I met up with this girl I haven't talked to in the past 6 months (I see her on weekly basis, but we rarely talked to each other). A complicated story, but we had a drama of sorts last year. but I believe we're on reasonably good terms now. She agreed to a coffee chat with me today so I met her up. She got to the coffee shop 15 minutes late and only stayed for 5 minutes or so, apologizing that she was in a hurry. But she did say this multiple times:      "I need more space right now, but I will initiate things when I am ready."      what does she mean by this?

20090222181619AAvK3ce	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think it is uncomfortable when dating within groups?	I have a group of four people (I'm included already) that are really good friends and all care about each other.  There are two girls, then me and another guy.  The other guy in the group is my all time best friend and he decided to date one of the girls because he really likes her.  So they are dating now, but it just feels strange.  Is it normal to want to know what it is that they talk about when you're not there, and everything else about what happens with them.  I am very defensive of these people and find their friendship to be more important than almost anything,  but I can't seem to be happy for them because it is just weird.  Is it normal to feel weird and awkward in this situation?  Oh, and I used to like the girl he is going out with before we formed our group.

My best friend since elementary school was friends with a girl, fell in love with her, they eventually became more than friends and have been together just shy of 2 years. She graduated last semester and went back home to her home country to find work while living with her family. The two were practically inseparable when they were together and they're just that kind of couple you never see breaking up. Now she's telling him after being gone for 3 weeks that she wants some space and feels like she's growing up and that there is just something better. How can he remind her of all the hard times they got through together and how much he cares for her without making her feel like he's desperate?

20090222114852AApXxtc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I pathetic? Help please...?	I am 22. I think I'm a really great guy, tall, handsome I would say. But I have never had a girlfriend. I am a little shy. I mean I can be very open when you get to know me, and lot of my friends in high school were girls. Every girl I'm interested in always ends up already having a boyfriend. These days I guess I just can't bring myself to approach anyone anymore. I guess I'm afraid of rejection.    I don't have a car b/c I don't drive- I kinda have a fear of it which is bizarre I know.    Would someone be able to look past that or is it impossible?    I think I've got a really great personality, and I know I would be a caring and dedicated boyfriend. I have a steady job, I'm very funny and creative. I play music in a band. I'm not rich, but I save my money. I mean, I would do anything for someone I liked. It's just like, I see young teenagers who have relationships and I've never really had one.    I sorta feel like a freak. Is there something wrong with me?

20090222142951AAWPN0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm scared that my boyfriend is gay.?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for a month and he is seemingly perfect.  He is sensitive, a great listener, and does the sweetest little things that no guy would ever think of.  He likes Celine Dion and chick flicks, which have made me slightly question his sexuality.  But then today he told me that when he was young, he let another dude go down on him.  So now I am horrified that i am going to fall for him only to find that he is gay.  I've talked with him about it and he said that he is completely disgusted by it and he isn't gay.. and that he would never leave me for another person (man or woman).  Oh.. and he is physically attracted to me.. and i have seen the proof that he is (if you know what i mean....haha)..       Should this be a warning sign or should I forget about this and have a great time with this guy who is seemingly the man of my dreams.  Help!

20090222132116AAyHjAd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship problems. Can anyone help me?	Okay, so here's the problem. Me and my girlfriend been together since October. It's February, and she's just now telling me that's she going to prom. "WITH ANOTHER DUDE". And the only reason I know now is because I asked her what does she want to wear to prom when we go. (I was asking to see what she was going to say). Okay, the dude she wants to go to prom with is a senior. She said they been planned this before me and her got together. Okay, my point is, when we got together she should have told him, well I have a boyfriend now and I don't think it would be a good idea to go to prom with you out of respect for him. Then, the first time I told her how I felt about it she told me she think I'm trying to control her. Then we started arguing so to calm everything down I told her I didn't mind she go with him. Now, about 1 week later, I bring it up again. So she tells me, okay fine. I'll go to prom with you. But every since then she has had an attitude with me. After her game one night, I said can I have a hug she said I don't give out hugs anymore. Then, when I got home that night, I checked my myspace and she had just posted a status saying "we lost tonight :( but on the other hand I feel single:) haha" so i wrote her phone and said, "if me tellin you how i feel make you so mad to the point you feel like you single, then you can be" then she acted like she den know what I was talkin bout. and now we are not even tlkin. she had another game the next day, yesterday, and i went to it and after her game she passed me to sit with some of her other friends and then she came and sat one row down for me but den say anything to me the whole night. we den exchange one word. I mean, am I right or am i wrong? Prom night should be a night for boyfriend and girlfriend or if you don't have one then you go as friends. please tell me what I should do.      Signed,      Confused guy.:(
20090222122632AAWvuWH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am jealous of bf sister?	And I really don't know why. She's younger than me by nine years. She's a sweet girl and apparently I am the only gf her brother has ever had that she's approved off. So what's my deal? She's adorable. So fashionable and super little. My bf is fashionable and cute and I feel like he needs a girl like his sister. They are close.       Sometimes I'll be ya love more than anyone else... (I tend to insecure) and he'll answer yes, but my sister is up there with you. I know he's trying to make a joke up it kind of hurts me. He's also left me when I needed him to talk to bother his sister .... he thought I was doing better .... am I over reacting. I'm afraid that when we get married (he wants to marry me) that he'll always leave me when his sister has an issue. I like his attention all on me. In my family nothing I had was ever really mine, so I kind of wanted my bf to have me as his only girl in his life.       Yea, I know it's good they are close. I just never dated anyone so attached to their sister before. Like he'll come to see me and detour to see her ... I love my brother to death. But when I go visit my bf I go to visit my bf.

I'm black but I just think asian guys are so beautiful, and it's not a faze cause it's always been like this but im scarred my friends and family wont except it!

What happened wasn't really any big thing, but a multitude of small things that have just been building up over time.  I haven't had a "talk" with him about them really, just hinted about the things he says that I don't like. For example, he talks about his ex-crush in HS quite a bit, and a few days ago I mentioned that it makes me uncomfortable when guys talk about girls they used to like.       Some other things that bug me are his egoism (he talks/brags about himself quite a bit), him constantly telling me when girls are hitting on him, telling me that he doesn't know how much time he'll have for me when I visit over spring break (he has finals...but he could easily prepare for them ahead of time like I did when he visited me during exams) and showing me chat excerpts of him and other girls.  Last night I got fed up because I was up until 8 am to talk to him (we used to do this a lot, but recently due to school its rare that I'll be up that late to chat). Instead of talking to me, it turned out he was playing a video game at the same time, so it took like 5 minutes in between responses.  He also told me he had a "bad dream" about him and another girl where she was holding his hand and they were at a mall or something. I don't want to know about that kind of thing =(.        At that point everything just had added up and I got fed up and told him I was going to bed. He didn't bother saying good night or anything, so I just left and I've had my phone off since this morning.       Am I just being a total *****? I'm considering dumping him at this point but I'm not sure if it's just hormones and stress causing me to overreact.  When he's not flaunting girls in my face, he says a lot of sweet things, but actions always speak louder than words to me.
20090222170946AAmlx9A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Affordable Pre Marriage counseling?	Now that my fiance and I live together, I understand the importance of getting some pre marital guidance. I see things like household chores, finances and all the other "grown up" responsibilities causing more and more turmoil between us. I would really like to speak with a counselor one on one to get advice from a neutral third party, but money is really tight. Does anyone know of any affordable counseling services? Or does insurance possibly cover it? We don't belong to a church or anything so I would prefer a counseling center. We are in Colorado by the way...Thanks for your help!

She seemed very flattered thou, she also was very apologetic to me, n was explaining herself as if I didn't believe her. We know each other, but I'm wondering, why was she flattered? Why did she explain herself? Should I keep talkin to her? She's really special to me.

20090222171315AAySuLz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you think he is only interested in sex?	I have a crush on this guy that I work with. We always joke around and he always talk to me in a sexual manner. Sometimes we hug each other and I would like things to go further but I am too shy to make the move.      For example, today when we were working, I told him that I have to use the washroom and he was like “I would love to join you but since the manager is here, I would get into trouble because we are going to make some noises".      I was flattered but I don't know if he is really serious or just joking around.      I was thinking to ask him if he wants to come over to my apartment since I live alone but I am not sure if he is really serious about it. I don't want to get the wrong idea and make fool of myself .He is 18 and I am 23      Do you he wants to get laid or just playing around?
20090222170457AA1dpVT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help! Aaaah! How do I get my parents to understand the concept of 'just friends'?	Okay, I'm going to start with this: I have a LOT of guy friends. About half of all my friends are guys. So my parents(I think my dad is just joking around about this, but definitely not my mom) always tell me, every time I say anything about any of them, that he is my boyfriend('he' being the one I happen to be talking about at whatever given moment). There are two guys that I text a lot, and hang out with on regular basis, though mostly at school. My mom will see that I text them, (one in particular who has been one of my best friends for several years) and always tells me about how much I like him. But, I don't, at least not at a level higher than friends. No matter how many times I tell her that he's a really good friend and nothing more, she ALWAYS comes back with 'Yeah. okay' and it really grates on my nerves. How in the world can I get the concept of 'just friends' into her skull? Please?

Do you like a girl who's really outgoing and talkative.. and kind of 'out there'.. like one that shows her true self right away.      or..      A girl who's nice, kind of mysterious, doesn't show her true self right away. Kind of leaves you hanging.. but you want to get to know her more.      which is more attractive?

20090222141340AAV891B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend is sending mixed signals?	Alright, Well about a year ago we started dating, At that time we were both in another relationship. But we were more or less tied to those other people. When she broke up with her ex. I was still with mine out of pity. I didn't want her to do anything, and my current waited several months until I was sure that my ex wouldn't be too upset. I did find out that she was using me though. Point is that me and my current with our combined secret and public relationship has hit about a year and two months. We seemed to be doing great. But after one year hit it went south. We started fighting a lot about the smallest, stupidest things. I even got mad over a picture of her kissing her ex from her time when she was together with him. I admit it was stupid of me to get angry about because it's in the past. But I still don't like the guy for how he treated her. Anyway, after another fight, she told me she was emotionally stretched past her limit because of the arguments. Then saying that she gives up on herself, in general. I don't know what to think or do. But then she says she needs space and sending mixed signals. One minute she'll say we'll be together again soon, Later she says she doesn't want to, after that she'll say she doesn't know. I love her so very much, and I know she loves me back, and I've been trying what I can to make changes so we can stop fighting, and be together and happy again like we were before. I'm just unsure if I'm doing anything wrong still or not. I think she might not trust me anymore or just is pitying me. I've tried being nice, being cold, being optimistic, and I couldn't help but be upset, although I've been doing better at actually concealing it. She says she's better off being alone. But she likes to beat herself up a lot too, So I think she might be doing it just to give herself reason or something.       Should I give her more space? Should I keep trying? Should I just flat out give up?       I don't want everything we've been through to end over a few little fights after all the good times we spent together.      What do you think I should try?

I'm determined to not go see him cause he should be coming to see me.  All he wants to do is work and i understand that as life is expensive, but what about me??  I showed him so much love.  I have met a guy (we are friends and nothing has happened between us) that is really good looking and maybe interested.  I'm confused.. I'm devastated as i still love this guy and we experienced the miscarriage of our daughter...

We used to be really really close when we were young...but now that i'm 19 and he's 25..i just feel we're so distant. He's always having a blast at university but as soon as he comes home he's all angry and he goes straight to his room and gets on the computer.    I try to talk to him but we usually get into stupid arguments, and the only way he actually has fun during a conversation with me is when he's teasing me or ridiculing me about something.    He deleted me from his facebook account cuz he's like some of his guy friends were wondering if i was single..so he obviously felt uncomfortable..and when i ask him if i can go to clubs with him he's like you're still too young...wtf i'm 19!   I've told him how i feel but he just takes it as a joke and ignores me...he's really pissing me off. grr..what should i do?      Even my parents think he's totally changed...he's closer to his friends than his family now..is it too much to ask for both?

He was telling her he wanted to take her on a date,called her babe and stuff like that.  He is not the cheating type especially since his ex cheated on him multiple times with one of his good friends after 2 years.  I looked through his text messages before and confronted him about the same thing and he made it sound like I was crazy for doing that. I want to confront him again but I don't want him to think I am crazy paranoid gf.  He is always shady about his phone and he hooked up (just kissed) with this girl when we were "technically" broken up. So I really don't know what to do here.   please help
20090222170820AAz0NdK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much physical custody will me ex boyfriend get?	My ex is suing me for joint physical and legal custody of our 3-year-old-daughter. He is a very bad alcoholic (drinking daily, binging a few times a week) with two DUIs and has a domestic violence arrest against me. We moved away from him 6 months ago and he has only asked to see her a few times. I have an extensive list of dates and times where he has shown up to meet her drunk. He only keeps down a job because he works for his parents, he hardly shows up and drinks on the job. I would be okay with supervised visits until he can prove that he is clean for a long time. I don't want him to get her for an overnight visit, she has never spent a night away from me. I suspect this is mostly his mother's doing since she has wanted to get my daughter alone (away from me) since she was born, and he hardly ever calls to talk to her or asks to see her. I have a good lawyer, but so does he. Does anyone with experience know what he will get?

20090222170947AAFleL2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl just flirting or does she like me?	I met this girl a couple months ago. We had class together and would often see each other during the day. We got along really well. I thought she liked me because she would often look directly into my eyes for long periods of time while we were talking. She would also playfully punch my arm sometimes. And she also laughed a lot around me.      One night when just the two of us were hanging out, we were lying on the floor next to each other in the dark and talked for a while. Her entire body was facing towards me, and her arm was laying pretty close to my head. At some point in the night we stopped talking and just kind of looked at each other, and she even closed her eyes for a bit. She told me a few times that she was really glad I came over. But I was too nervous to make a move.      About a week after that when I did try to make a move, things didn't turn out so well, and now she's telling me she never liked me and is just flirtatious. I think she's lying to me because I didn't make a move and she moved on or got bored.       So did she like me or was it just being a flirtatious friend?
20090222171201AAl8r1g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband Won't Sign Separation Agreement! Help!?	I have been separated from my husband for 2 months. I had a consultation with my lawyer and he said that it will be 1500 for a separation agreement to be signed or 5000 and up for a contested divorce. My husband originally agreed to sign the agreement but now he says he won't.  I really don't have the 5000 for a contested divorce but I want to move on with my life "legally", if you know what I mean.  Is there any way to move on without him signing a separation?  I live in Virginia and I know it's a long shot and the answer might be no, but I am desperate.  Thanks for any input!

But I do hang out with friends. All my friends and even my 14 year old brother has someone. My friends told me about 7 months ago that I will get someone soon. It didn't happen. That lie wasn't funny =\.      I really want a girl to cuddle, have my first kiss, spend time with etc. If I do get a girlfriend, I will be really happy. But I feel it will never happen.      Before you tell me 18 is still young. Im live in the UK. 18 is considered an adult. So I am an adult and never had a girlfriend LOL.
20090222120813AA2nTsn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do? please help!?	i really like this guy, he's one of my good friends. i love his personality, and his looks are okay.. we've dated once before, but every time someone found out about us, they would say something like, "omg! YOUR going out with HIM!" and somehow make me feel guilty like i shouldn't be dating him! he doesn't deserve to be broken up with again, but i really wanna go out with him! i just can't take the peer pressure from my "friends."       i don't really have a lot of friends, so i don't want to lose any more!!
20090222121524AAVQ7pI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gf tries to boss me around?	Hi, sorry about long post:(      I've been with a girl for a couple of months now and we are doing fine. She asked me out and she has told me that she she has really liked me for a while (I had another gf then, I haven't asked if she knows about it because I dont really want to talk about it, but you know.. facebook)       anyway she likes to boss me around and I hate it. If i laugh silly or say something wierd the makes fun out of me and I hate when people do that, it really hurts. When we just sit around I try to make suggestions of what to do, but she doesn't listen and today she only wanted to talk to my mum for some reason. Probably to get well on with her, but she doesn't let me talk with her father without interrupting.       I can live with that, and we have good times together. When she tries to boss me around do my best in not letting her, I start reading a book or something and try to show that I'm NOT liking it. The trouble is that I can hardly ever talk about myself or my own feelings and I really need that now, I'm having sort of a hard time.       I don't know if I will talk to her about it because shes got a really bad conscience and I'm afraid she would feel really bad about it. I don't know how to mention it either. I've thought of leaving her, but we share some classes at school and because of friends too I think it would be complicated. I dont know...

20090222133703AAfSDe6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you say this guy's interested? Should I make a move?	We've lived in the same dorm for a year (and been good friends for about as long), and worked together for about 6 months.      He's a friendly guy with most people, but he is FOREVER hugging me/picking me up, teasing me, flirting kinda playfully... When he talks to me he tends to touch me... on the shoulder, arms, knee/thigh (if we're sitting down)... If i pout in his presence he laughs and hugs me or pinches my cheek or something. At least two of our friends think something's going on between us, since we prop our doors open (we're across from each other in the hall) and talk for hours, and tend to know where the other can be found.       Also, he tends to get frustrated with me when I do things that get me hurt and we have this inexplicable way of ending up sitting/standing near each other everywhere.......and he feeds me! (he's a great cook, btw :-D)      I really, really like him... to the point where he has NEVER seen me in a bad mood, because he always puts me in a good one.... but I'm not certain that he likes me... at least not like that. I'm worried that if I make a move and he... thinks of me a sibling or something, that I'll ruin what we have going at the moment. But then I'm afraid that if I don't make a move that some other girl WILL... and that this time he won't turn them down.      Help!

Can you name one or more either physically or personality feature/s that you like about you partner?       Because tonight I found out that my husband has no problem telling about things that he dislikes about me, but he cannot specify one thing that he likes about me....I asked him to name one thing he likes about me, and he just kept generalizing, like saying (all of you, I can't pick and choose) so I asked, then name something you like about my personality, he says ( I like like your personality) I said, you like what about my personality, he just laughs... then when I kept insisting on an answer he said he likes my boobs....are you kidding me, he likes all woman's boobs how is that suppose to make me feel special?!! he can pick and choose when it comes to negative things, but he can't find anything positive to say about me?!! I want to know if all men are like that, or only my husband. Oh and I always tell him what I love about him, always, although there are things that annoy me, but I try not to mention it because telling him good things about him lifts his spirits, and makes him happier.
20090222175118AAespTl	Family & Relationships;Friends	This friendship can't be normal, can it?	I'm a 25 year old female and I have this male friend the same age... we're really close and have fooled around/slept together a couple times for like a week about 3 months ago. Even before this and even still now, we spend the majority of our free time together, watching movies, having dinner, even sleeping in the same bed together like 3 times a week, fully clothed, nothing has happened since that one week. We also work together and bring each other coffee every morning and have lunch together everyday. And when I say everyday I really mean every single day. About a month ago I told him I'm in love with him but he said he doesn't feel like that about me and wanted to keep things the way they are, and that he would never want to lose me as a friend. It didn't make things weird like I thought it would have, in fact, everything has remained exactly the same. It seems to me that we act like we're in a relationship together, minus the physical stuff. I don't get it...

20090222182112AA2Ad73	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I quit my job?	OK, I'm really obsessing over this question given the economy. Here's the deal. I work part time as a secretary for this ultra rich dude. I work part-time although he expects me to get the work done of a full time employee. So, if items don't get completed in the time I have he calls me and makes my life horrible. I seriously bend over backwards for him, even when I'm at work I literally run to the bathroom because I'm busting my butt so much. In my heart I know I am doing a great job, but this person is just so unbearable. Also, my commute is 3 hours total when I go to work for him so it's a lot on me, my husband and my car.       Now, here's another side of things. My husband works a ton and is the breadwinner for us. The job I have is just extra and we wouldn't be in duress if I left this job. Since, I've been working, my household organization and cooking has fallen through the floor and I'm exhausted which stresses him out...not good.      So, am I fool for leaving this job for the sake of stability for my marriage or should I take heed of what Suze Orman says and keep whatever job you have and be grateful and save?      Like I said, this extra money I make is really just used as a mini line of credit for my small online business which I haven't been able to put too much time into as well.      Thanks for any input.

My mom was never really around and my grams raised my 2 older brothers and me.      How do I get rid of the emptiness of not having the complete feel of a family or being lucky to be called "daddy's little girl"? I thought I got over it but it hurts more than I ever realized.      I consider myself a social person I have friends I love to do activities but I still can't shake the feeling for some reason anyone has tips or advice?

20090222184350AA4fHih	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I Tell My Parents Of My Uncles Jackassery?	My uncle is an idiot. In his defense he had a very abusive childhood. But so did my dad. He never finished high school. My dad put himself through college and opened his own business. He allowed my uncle to be a partner in his business. My uncle has no capacity or ability to be anything more than a clerk. He ran a store of ours for thirty years. The store was a mess, it was our biggest store. I can't imagine how much money was lost due to him not being able to run it and the employees being smarter than him and taking advantage of him. He doesn't think of the bottom line and spends money on stupid stuff like it is going out of fashion. On the other hand my dad ran a smaller store, spent less money on stuff and made more money with a smaller store.      My uncle was a huge druggie from the time he was eighteen till about fifteen years ago. Coke, pot, alcohol etc.       It comes out three years ago that my uncle was in debt 250,000 to credit cards. This makes no sense because he made a hundred thousand dollars a year from our business and lived an apartment owned by my dad who charged him much less than what normal rent should be. He has no family, no wife, no kids etc. He never purchased expensive cars or anything. I have no idea where the money went.      My parents get the credit card company to settle with him for sixty thousand. They loan him sixty thousand to pay this cause he doesn't have any money. He is apparently paying them off.      My dad just sold his piece of property partially owned by my uncle. My dad owns like eighty percent and my uncle twenty percent. My dad basically sold the building because he wanted to get out of the business with my uncle and give him a second chance in life after he lost his money. My uncle got around a half a million. This is his last chance.      My uncle has a stupid friend who owned a business that made money for the last thirty years but in the last five it has been loosing money and he is going out of business. The idiot is putting his own money into the failing business. My parents have always worried that my uncle would loan money to his stupid friend. I just found out that he loaned at least fifty grand to the guy.      I don't think that my parents know. Should I tell them?
20090222185051AAGEAwF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i do it or not?	ive been trying to get with this  girl that happens to be my ex. we both admitted that we still have feelings for eachother but it seems like im more comitted then her. it has been going nowhere though so im really confused on if i should keep trying or not. i know she cares about me but it seems like she likes hanging out with her friends more. i have told her a few times that if things change between us good or bad for her to just let me know and i wont be mad and she says ok but things seem bad right now and she hasn't told me anything. i want to be with her so bad because i care about her so much but its so hard because it feels like im chasing the impossible. i know it sounds like its just me hoping but she always says things to me that indicate she still likes me but then when i ask why we dont get back together she says its not that easy. i need to just tell her how i feel and if shes not feeling it then just move on but how do i do it? why is she stringing me along like this?

20090222190106AAPKhjb	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What's the big deal about girls and their weddings?	I feel like most girls start planning their weddings before they're old enough to date! Everyone has an idea of how they want their weddings to be, etc. but I just don't care. I'm not interested in spending a ton of time and money for a party celebrating the fact that I've decided to enter a legal contract with a man.      Why are girls obsessed with romance and their weddings and "their" special day and the dress and cake and everything has to be *perfect*. Seriously. I don't get it.

20090222183910AAcHefY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you really want to know on the first or second date if the person was dating others?	This is a follow-up to a question I asked earlier.  Some people are saying that you should be up front with people about whether you're dating others.  My question is, why would you volunteer this information in the early stages of dating someone?  I always assume that a girl I've been on only a few dates with might be dating others.  I honestly would not want her to tell me she's dating others at this early point, as it seems pointless      I would think that if someone gets upset on the first or second date that you're dating other people as well, they might not be quite mature enough for dating.      Thoughts?

20090222184508AAbnxuf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does she find me comforting?	An acquaintance of mine said that she found me "comforting" to talk to. We only know each other online, and there's the fact that I'm a condescending, bitter, cynical, caustic, misanthrope. Yet she still finds me comforting, and 'in a weird way' sweet... Says that's what keeps her coming back. What's weirdest is, she considers me amongst her best friends. Which really freaks the hell outta me      I'm guessing brain damage? Why does she find me comforting?      Who knows, desperation does weird things to people. I swear this is probably just gonna be some elaborate joke though. But considering we've talked for 3-5 years now, she'd have to be really dedicated, or really lonely.

20090222184714AAyB45f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I to do about love?	I have 2 friends that I have dated in the past. One is 46 and I dated for 4 yrs. I'm 33 and was head over hills in love with him. Yes he hurt me really bad.  He works but never share any of his earnings (low income) doesn't give back rubs, clean, cook, fix thigs or seem to show any regards to my safety, comfort, or issues. I left him and met friend number two who is 31 yrs old. we dated for 1.5 yrs. He simply adores me. He gives me back rubs, cooks, cleans, playful, eventful, and truly cares about me. He has had legal issues Jail time no job bcuz of it now( worked prior to) and has lost his license for 1 yr. Yes I left him and went back to the first friend but I became  uninterested quickly once we got back together. I found myself thinking of the other guy the 31 yr old! Well I finally hooked up wth #2 again (31) and it was wonderful! Back rubs, stroll through the park just lovely! I have lived alone for the last 8 years (divorced) and use to doing it my way! I make 68k and feel like I would be making a mistake with either guy bcuz I should want someone that makes what I make or more! Most of those types are boring and only wants to talk about business/money! Yes I like rough/edgey men! Why am I thinking like this? The older guy has been begging me to give him another chance but I just don't think I'm happy with him. The 31 yr old wants me but I know I will need to tone my attitude down bcuz he is jobless, and I'm liable to say anything! Should I try him (31) again? I'sn't it about having someone to balance you enjoying time spent, love you and not about money/status, past mistakes,? Help shade some light on this feeling!
20090222191227AAiPga2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question for all tough women- what should i tell myself and be strong?	my husband and i have lot of issues in our marriage. i tried talking to my mom about this . but she tried ignoring my problem saying that i complain a lot and it could be my mistake. even my dad used to pretend as if everything is fine and nevr wanted to discuss any thing.      my husband is not close to me either. he doesnt discuss anything with me about his friends, work and doesnt talk much otherwise also. i try to be very open with him in every matter and he doesnt like my frankness. anger issues and revengefull types. sometimes he tells me be "normal like others". i dont want divorce and stuff.          how do i live in this situation ??

20090222190643AAJzd9G	Family & Relationships;Friends	Group of Friends Dating?	I have a group of four people (I'm included already) that are really good friends and all care about each other. There are two girls, then me and another guy. The other guy in the group is my all time best friend and he decided to date one of the girls because he really likes her. So they are dating now, but it just feels strange. Is it normal to want to know what it is that they talk about when you're not there, and everything else about what happens with them. I am very defensive of these people and find their friendship to be more important than almost anything, but I can't seem to be happy for them because it is just weird. Is it normal to feel weird and awkward in this situation? Oh, and I used to like the girl he is going out with before we formed our group.   I have already talked to them and they know how I feel about it. Well, they don't really have secrets because I'm the one who hears all of them (actually it's really annoying). I guess I don't really want to know what they talk about, but I do think there is some jealousy. The guy is the greatest friend I have and I am just working on being happy for them. I'll work on it, I'm sure it will be fine considering they said that as long as me and the other girl act normal, things will be normal (even though it won't really be fully normal).   Please answer some of my other questions.

20090222184331AAVKL1D	Family & Relationships;Family	Mom caught watching porn!?	I was going through and deleting some files and I accedentlly hit enter instead of delete (on the menu thingy) and It popped up. My mom was already in my room, but it didn't seem like an issue since it didn't have a name. It popped up and she caught a 2 second glimps before I switched to another window (that thank god froze my computer) and then we just had an awkward silence. She said she didn't didn't know what to say and I told her that I didn't either. She also asked me why I looked at pornogrophy (What the He** kind of question is that!?) I couldn't answer, so more silence. When she asked me what that was on the screen a moment ago I told her "stuff" and we went on like that for a good 3 minutes, but she ended it like it never happend. The only thing about that upsets me is that she had the same tone and the same expression that she had when she caught me. It's funny because I was the last one in the family to get caught. My eldest sister got caught looking at lesbian porn (and she is a lesbo) and middle sister got caught looking at gay porn (because she's a freak) and heck even my dad got caught looking at HBO porn. If anything she looks at it to. So what the hell do I its sunday I've been cleaning all day and my mom's doing school work down in the living room so I have to get past her to go the kitchen and to do laundry. Someone plz tell what do I or don't I do in such a situation. My dad and my sister already knew, me and my dad already had the talk and everything, so is she going to tell my outer famlily try to discuss this with me, anything helps.

20090222190521AASfZVg	Family & Relationships;Family	Need advice on mother in law?	The other day my mother in law got a call from someone (whom we think was a scam artist).  He said that he wanted information on my husband and me (as far as account numbers and etc.) she didn't give any info out, but the person who called also  said  that they were trying to get ahold of a person who is my grandfather (whom she doesn't even know or seen).  So instead of calling me or my husband about the person wanting our account info. she went over us and called my grandfather.  So we found out from my grandfather that she had called him about this matter.  I think she should have first called her son and let him know about the call and then let me contact my grandfather.  When I had asked her why she didn't call me or my husband, she said that she thinks that I had no right to be the middle person between her and my grandparents and that this was between her and them.  I told her she should have called me or her son first to let us know someone was trying to get info about us and she then replied that the call was none of my business (although she said that the person had asked info on me and my husband) and that i was a piece of @#%&.   What do I do now?
