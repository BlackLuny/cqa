265fd4cbb93fdd2558477d6a36b37857aa	Hi there.. you made some nice comments in your question, well done.<br>  <br>  The Hawks are originally based in Hawthorn, Melbourne but they have a 15 million dollar sponsorship deal with the Tasmanian State Government which sees them play four home games per season at Aurora Stadium in Launceston. This is why you see 'Tasmania' on their guernseys.<br>  <br>  Since playing their first Tasmanian home game (in the late nineties I think) they have really built on Tasmanian members for their club and the state government sponsorship has only incresed public interest in the Hawks. There are still three years left on the sponsorship deal but the Hawthorn Football Club would like to see this continue, so they are striving to do as much as they can to appease the Tasmanian public as well as their government so that they can continue having financial stability at their club.<br>  <br>  In case you wondered, the sponsorship deal is based on encouraging tourists to visit Tasmania, many already coming to watch the Hawks play some home games here. You should come here one day... Tasmania is a crap place to live but its a beautiful place to visit. Some of the scenery is breathtaking :)|`|pgSHnkf7aa	Hawks are a Victorian team. Hawthorn is a Melbourne Suburb. They play in tassie coz Tassie doesn't have a team and I think they have a sponsor in tassie. Hawthorn AREN'T playing for melbourne!<br>  <br>  YAY HAWKS!!!!!!!!!|`|L6UnZNBCaa	hawthorn is a suburb in melbourne and they are definately not from tasmania. i think they just got a sponsorship deal with the tasmanian government|`|B2obE7OOaa	victoria in the eastern suburbs tasmania is one of hawthorns main sponsors thats why its on the team shirts|`|nB2sVcbBaa	they play 4 games ther a season so tassie get 2 hav some footy coz the afl dont think ther gd enough 4 a team<br>  stupid demetriou <br>  they r based in the best state<br>  ...<br>  VICTORIA!!!<br>  |`|oSw7VxWvaa	Hawthorn is in Melbourne<br>  <br>  Geelong isn't in Melbourne but is Victoria's second biggest city|`|A8rDRLCPaa	Victoria|`|0JAw1OPXaa	I think it's Tasmania<br>  <br>  Well it should be.<br>  <br>  If not, then Tasmania should have its own AFL team|`|uG8yLnUWaa	Hawthorn are most definitely Victorian but they play (I think) 4 home games is Tas each season so they have a pretty big supporter base down there. They went down there to show off the Premiership cup to their Tassie fans!<br>  <br>  There is a real push at the moment by Tasmania to have a team from Tassie included in the AFL, but the league is convinced that there should be a Gold Coast Team and then another Sydney team.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question though is that Hawks play for themselves but are based in Melbourne and are part of the AFL.<br>  <br>  (And yes, It was fantastic to see them win!! Even though I am an Eagle supporter)|`|2s244jGgaa	Short & sweet --<br>  <br>  Victoria - yet they play about four or so games in Tasmania, to give their Tasmania supporters a taste of footy.
2s244jGgaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It really showed that you dont have to be the best side all year - but the grand final is all that matters, on that final day in september you have got to be the best - and that is what the hawks were.|`|hkAcgIMbaa	im sooooooooooooo haapppy because i am a hawks supporter and crawf finally got a premiership|`|LuhTixmsaa	Yes good on them!<br>  Especially for Crawf, he deserved it.<br>  <br>  I think that the unlucky team is St Kilda though<br>  Lost in 3 prelims against the preimers.<br>  04- Lost to Port Adelaide<br>  05- Lost to Sydney<br>  08- Lost to Hawthorn <br>  all in the prelims<br>  :-(<br>  oh well<br>  <br>  Good on the hawkers! :D|`|b4UvksEkaa	oh yeah great.  -not-<br>  p.s. i dont support cats. |`|oSw7VxWvaa	******* great!|`|265fd4cbb93fdd2558477d6a36b37857aa	I am stoked for them!<br>  <br>  Well done Hawks!|`|U0po52vJaa	I am not a Hawks supporter but just to see Crawford get a GF was brilliant.<br>  |`|4eUCo2ioaa	Hawks rock!!!!!

ME62Mtv4aa	it's a toss up with Dice-K and Lester but as much as Dice -K does well he scares the crap outta me with those walks!!!! And then Beckett now if was Beckettt from last year he'd be on the top for sure!|`|XL5OiBUTaa	i actually despise the deadsox but the best pitcher at the moment in dice-k. he shut down (unfortuantly) the rays last night.  LETS GO O'S|`|7DpSj5Buaa	Right now, I would say Jon Lester.  He is a real solid pitcher, no matter what.  Dice K is just decent.  Sometimes he can be great and others he can be horrible.  Dice K is very inconsistent.  Josh Beckett is hurt right now so he isn't as great as usual.  Jon Lester is the best pitcher right now on the Red Sox|`|dABLPCmnaa	It doesn't matter, all three belong to the Red Sox so it is likely they will win the WS|`|kGjk15CPaa	After seeing Dice-K pitch a No hitter through the 7th id have to say its a toss up between Lester and Dice-K....just as long as they win games it doesn't matter who's better.|`|LL4opmumaa	Beckett (When he is healthy)    Jon Lester right now though, i'm a big sox fan and a big lester fan and i watch mostly like 120 of the 162 games a year and i have seen every lester game and he has dominated.

Daisuke is better on the road but he is incredible on the road and good at home and Lester is just solid. I would say Daisuke.|`|zgPr8HQyaa	I think overall Daisuke Matsuzaka is one of the best pitchers in baseball.  As far as dominating a game, it would be a healthy Beckett, but since he's injured Lester is by far the most dominating pitcher.    Lester and Beckett are the types of guys that can tell the hitter what they're gonna throw and where they're gonna throw it, and then throw is past them anyway, they're just that intimidating and have that much control.  Beckett has a history of coming up big in big games, so overall I give him the edge, but with him injured, I think Lester's better at this time.    Matsuzaka is an entirely different type of pitcher.  He allows a ton of baserunners, walks a lot of people, but doesn't give up runs.  He's not dominating like Lester or Beckett, but has so many pitches he can throw it's easy for him to fool hitters and keep them guessing.  He can also throw a ton of pitches and go deep into games as he showed last night.    I think Lester and Dice-K would be tied for the best right now, but they're completely different types of pitchers, so it's hard to compare them against eachother.|`|UI04rrWVaa	Beckett|`|VSeQMpzqaa	Right now, Lester.|`|KXh6YPByaa	Right now Jon Lester.    But Dice-K is going to be a damn good pitcher for a long time.    and Beckett is the one with the most skill, but he is hurting right now, and he isn't going 100%.  but when healthy, he is the Sox best starter.|`|gN56VYGDaa	Lester hands down.  He hasn't given up an earned run in the postseason yet.  He hasn't walked even close to as many people Dice-k has.  With Beckett not having a very good year, he has done extremely well.|`|1wHfVAMuaa	Becket.... Then Lester..... 
SqKpmGLvaa	Actually Rugby League in the old days was classed for the upper class and rugby union was a peasant game.<br>  <br>  You know nothing, its prob coz ur to bad at playing it it gets you down watching it.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Well, the obvious answer is if you don't like it, don't watch it. End of lesson. <br>  <br>  Have you ever bothered to look up different players to see their backgrounds? No that would be too much like hard work wouldn't it Troll.|`|8YBiVlcTaa	I think what your getting at is, union is primarily a southern sport so i think that helps to get more media coverage. I prefer rugby so I don't watch union each to their own.<br>  Edit: what's with the thumbs down? please explain|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Looking at the other questions you've asked, I'm guessing you're a league fan. If so, why do so many league fans seem to have such an inferiority complex that they constantly have to run down union?<br>  <br>  If you don't like it, don't watch it.<br>  <br>  Most people outside North America think American football is boring and overhyped, but I don't feel the need to run down other people who don't enjoy it as much as I do.<br>  <br>  All that said, as a fan of both rugby union and American football, here's the problem I have with league: It lacks the most interesting parts of both sports. It lacks the rucks, mauls, lineouts, and contested scrums that give union its character and depth, and it lacks the forward passes that make American football so exciting to watch. As a result, it seems terribly one-dimensional. So I don't watch it. But I don't sit around criticizing other people who do.<br>  <br>  That's my two cents.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You didn't have to mention league in your question. It was obvious what you were getting at, and the other questions you've asked reinforced everyone's suspicions: You like league better, so you want to take a shot at union. Like I said before, if you don't like it, don't watch it.|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	I've tried to watch league but it sends me to sleep. all the bash up the middle, reset and repeat is quite boring. And it's not just for the upper classes. Where I'm from everyone can play rugby no matter where you're from.|`|AA11406778	You are!|`|S8y67Ogmaa	Rugby Union and say, Rugby League are like comparing V8 supercars on Mt Panorma and Formula One or Indy. They're all high powered. Different strategies. Different strengths. Union is tactical in it's own way. It doesn't have spectacular crunches every hit, but the close in tactical strength is obvious to a player. It requires better out and out open throttle speed, which suits a particular build of player. But if you think you can be quick like Habana (Boks) and thats all, someone like Joe Rocokoko (NZ AB's) is stronger. Or all out gutsy like Mortlock (Wallabies), and you have to save yourself to captain and to kick goals. So, union lines the players up face to face, and it's fun to see the match ups. The rules keep the match up as a one on one, which to some is boring, but it can also be a continuous brutal arm wrestle, and not a flat out rubber burn, or a smash and grab. |`|kwB2NiAnaa	Rugby Union is a game of brutal thuggery and subtlety and skill.  To know what the teams are trying to achieve is the 'game' and watching the other team stop them is the 'game' just like every other sport.  Performing under pressure as a team in this very technical sport is the very reason why it spawns leaders in other pursuits after the boots are retired.  Knowing our rules and realising that we have a game for all shapes and sizes may help to keep you awake. For me there are moments I get goosebumps from the exhibition of skills.  Australia has no upper classes (only arrogant wankers, who are easily put back in their place).  Good Luck (November 1 Hong Kong vs The All Blacks)|`|iaZewr3waa	Just because it puts you to sleep, doesn't mean others are affected the way you are. People are entitled to their own opinions and keep it that way. So you'll definitely answers with mixed opinions. But if you want an answer here it is: It's "boring" and "overhyped" to you because you simply don't like it compared to league. |`|m7fkJ3l5aa	panther was probably put to sleep after his "long sessions" with his sister<br>  <br>  I like union especially DAN CARTER!!!!!!!!!!!! but the international games as oppose to the Super 14 club games.

qpAkpRfUaa	-  dribbling<br>  - free hit<br>  - dangerous play (it is a foul )<br>  - obstruction<br>  - drive , slap pass<br>  <br>  <br>  ps: for the second one, there are many different types of free hits when the ball goes out of bounds. This depends on which team hits it out of bounds, and whether it goes out of the sideline, or the endline. <br>   <br>   examples:.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Off the end line<br>            ~if it is hit out of bounds by the defending goalie or the  <br>  defending team, it is called a long hit. This is taken at the little dash that lies on the sideline, exactly 5 yards from the endline. (this hit is taken by the team trying to score)<br>             ~ If the ball is hit out of bounds by the team trying to score in that particular end, the defending team takes a 16 yard hit. The defending team brings the ball up to the 16 yard line from their endline and it is taken there. <br>  <br>  Off the sideline<br>            ~ Whatever team does NOT hit the ball off the sideline takes the free hit. This applies to all sideline out of bounds plays. <br>  |`|AxfXoESraa	-there is no real answer for that but the closest answer is dribble<br>  -free hit (and should be "is awarded") but a corner and short corner can be awarded (if the ball goes over the defending line after being touched by a the team defending that end a long corner is awarded which is taken around 5 yards up the side line from the base line)<br>  , if the ball is deliberately pushed over this back line by a defender a short corner should be awarded)<br>  if the ball is hit over the back line by the offensive team a "16" is awarded where a free hit is awarded to the opposition in 16 yards from the base line (in line with the top of the D ) <br>  -dangerous (its not normally named but its labled as dangerous play)<br>  -obstruction <br>  -hit or slap?, it can actually be anything apart from a flick unless you touch the ball twice in a row (then you are penalized).<br>  <br>  These questions are not worded very well and show lack of knowledge in the sport (whether these are your own or they are homework)|`|VO653Msjaa	<a href="http://www.dictionaryofgambling.com/gambling_terms/field_hockey/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dictionaryofgambling.com/gamb...</a><br>  <br>  hope it helps!:)|`|a5g60zfxaa	ok, i dont know anything about field hockey....|`|8j3SA9H0aa	No idea :s
fDT92ynuaa	Too much for covering here but try this--You love playing flanker--why ? If because of the action, and contribution you are more than halfway there.Think of yourself as playing 29 others--you should always want the ball, off your team mates as well.Be first. Practise--When you tackle try to always go low,below knees,as you go to ground, bring your knees up to your stomach, this puts your feet and legs in a postion you can spring !! back to your feet quickly,and compete for the ball.You dont have to use your hands first on the ground to get up.Try it,its a lot faster.From set pieces {your ball} get out in front of your backs, dont wait then run behind them.Stay on the inside of each ball carrier in support.From set pieces {opp ball} Dont go at no 10 flat out, and get beaten on the inside, Aim for opp inside shoulder and stay on that line as they move,WATCH their hips  cut off any thought of an inside pass.If no 10 or anyone else passes or kicks, you have done your job.Dont let them run.From an opp  lineout always stand on the 15m line regardless of where their no 7 stands, Practise--when you have a team run ask coach if you can run with your team,and practise staying in support on the insde etc then play against your team from all set pieces {even if its only you}.and practise angles, get your backs to do moves and practise your role including the tackle and spring up.You need some power, but agility, speed and endurance mostly attitude are better than trying to bulk up.Hope this helped ,the rest can be pretty involved, and take pages !!! as you have to work with your number 8 and what the team does in defence, and attack and whether your team just drives over the ball or if you try and stay up first. go get em !!      |`|zjGRfALRaa	You don't need to bulk up. But I would do some sprinting as it helps your speed straight off the mark, which you will need if you are an Openside. you also need to be ready all the time. your coach will be expecting you to be at most rucks and maul more so after a scrum|`|Q7GDRa2Faa	When I played in the 1970s, the open-side flanker would target the scrum-half, the blind-side flanker the fly-half, and the No. 8 would run in deep cover defence.  These days, more practically, the blind-side man runs the deep cover, the No. 8 aims at the fly-half - but you, the open-side flanker, get the most realistic chance to nail the scrum-half.  In the real world, a good scrum-half would be too quick, but you can try to unnerve him.  Just remember that, if you break too early, the ref will ping you.  Plan B, of course, is to just track the ball along the backline.  So aim yourself at the scrum-half on an angle - ready to hit him if he's too slow, but also able to veer off towards the fly-half, then along the backline.  Keep low, ready to tackle or join the ruck.  Try to be first at the breakdown.  Actual tackling of the ball-carrier comes second to a general harassment of the backline.  Rather than bulking up, try to increase your flexibility, stamina and speed.  Give yourself a good position at the back of the lineout.  Even if you join the maul, you'll be ready to detach and either make up the extra man in attack, or track the backline movement in defence.  If you've got good balance, a decent turn of speed and good stamina, the open-side flanker is a very rewarding job - you're always involved.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Cliff|`|FsiOXWYLaa	Well depending on how old you are is how i would tell u to get bigger.  If u are over 18 and ur body has grown, then if it's your off season, use this time to work on ur explosive power. This is the most important power for a flanker to have. U need to to be powerful in short explosive Bursts and the best way is to (while ur not playing) squats in heavy Weight regions. Again only if ur over 18 as if u do to heavy weights when young it will really stuff u up. Also an exercise using the weight balls(medicine balls )which starting from a sprinters starting stance, u lift and charge 2-3 meters and back to ur starting position    repeat over. this will also help ur explosion.<br>  Apart from pilfering the ball at the breakdown which is very important u must work on ur tackling off the fringe of the ruck, this means to attack the fly half or 1 off ball runners coming through 1st phase play. To shut them down is imperative to being a good flanker. in regards to pen. as a flanker u will always get pinnged even if u are really good. Just remember the basic rules of staying on ur feet and enter from the back. play close to the rules and figure out how much the ref will let u get away with. different refs will police different rules more.  |`|r5FAz0Daaa	to be open side flanker you should be quick so practise sprints 10,15 and 50M is good . u need good cardio fitness for endurences to help u to get into rucks and mauls so long distnace running helps alot with this. tackling isn't as important as appling the pressure but still important but if ur not a good tackler just try and grab the jersey of the five eight (the man u should target) or the half back if hes slow to get the ball out of the scrum. but it is alot better if u can tackle him . so alot of tackling pratise is impotant. <br>  <br>  good luck with it hope u do well|`|AA11586164	there is 6 things needed . the ball,the opposing player ....the ball or the opposing player ....the ball & the opposing players|`|n5KNd973aa	Watch all the best open siders in the game and they are all good at the same thing...... cheating.  Yes that's right cheating without getting caught|`|gap3pRQDaa	Some things you need to do as openside flanker (i am an experience openside/blindside flanker who has played at top club level).<br>  <br>  You need to practise 10, 15 ,20, 30, 40 and 50 meter sprints.<br>  Do lots of calf/hamstring/quadriceps weight training. Do sprints/long distance runs while holding a 8kg medicine ball.<br>  You need this to break from the scrum really quickly to smash tackle the opposition scrum half (i love doing that!!!)<br>  You also need this quick explosive bursts for getting up from a ruck or maul and quickly joining the next maul/ruck or assisting attack/defence.<br>  <br>  You need to practice your tackling.  Practice tackling and geting up fom the ground really quickly.  You need this so you ar constantly in play either attacking or defending.  You need to get good at technique of your tackles.<br>  <br>  Ruck practice.  You need to practice using you hands to support yourself in a ruck.  You only have to keep your knees off the ground in a ruck.  You can use your hands to dig in to the ground to stop people ceaning you out.  Practice cleaning out and recycling the ball.  Make sure you get good at technique for cleaning out.  You need strength to flip over people who are laying on the ball.<br>  <br>  Maul practice.  Practice this by pushing a car along a road (make sure someone is sitting in the drivers seat so it doesn't run away from you or crash into anything.  NB make sure it is turned off.  You are doing this for strength exercise.  <br>  <br>  When going for a jog, put on a good heavy duty back pack and buy packets of 2kg rice so that you put the packets in the backpack and have about 10-30kg on your back.  this is for Strength, Stamina, mental determination, if jogging on toes this is good for acceleration, if jogging on your flat of your feet this is for max speed and distance.<br>  <br>  Handling of the ball.  Practice passing, catching and 'juggling'.  This was my weakest point of my game.   My strongest part of my game was my rucking and burst of speed.<br>  <br>  Put me in friends and contact me via email if you need anymore advice.<br>  <br>  I have played at top club level (but had to retire due to head injuries).<br>  <br>  PS make sure you wear headgear and a mouthguard.  These are IMPORTANT.

MT9vBy3Baa	As an "old school" fan, look at the Von Erich tragedies because from David's death, Kerry won the NWA Title from Ric Flair but lost it a short time later. This also began the way fans got to see World Class and eventually the USWA. In this area is where stars such as Jeff Jarrett, Jerry Lawler, Mark Calloway [aka the Undertaker] and others got their break into wrestling. I am not saying that the Benoit, Hart or Guerrero tragedy was any better or worse but look at the eras before you compare this. I have both DVDS on the World Class era [an independant one and the WWE one] and there was so much less on the WWE one to the independant one which you can tell if you know the history. Again, in hte World Class era if you saw how the fans poured out following the tragedies of David, then Mike before Chris and Kerry took their lives then look at the outpouring for the Harts, Guerrero and then Benoit.  |`|pg5AHNcdaa	Benoit for how much it was widely reported on the national news.

zgPr8HQyaa	The Dodgers can still win, but their pitching needs to come up big.  Yesterday was a big loss, as I thought going in they had the pitching advantage.  <br>  <br>  The biggest reason the Dodgers can win is the change in ballpark.  The Philles have better hitting, and Citizens Bank Park in Philly is one of the best hitting ballparks in the country.  However, the Dodgers stadium is a pitcher friendly ballpark, and I think the Dodgers have better starting pitching in the 2, 3, and 4 spots, so they can come back.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for them, they'd have to come back to Philly for a game 7 though,and unless they get an amazing pitching performance from someone, I dont think they can win there.|`|hKh3KTePaa	The Phillies made a bad mistake they made Manny mad. When they make Manny mad he goes out there and hits a homerun in every at bat. The offense will follow Manny and make the Phillies pay. The Phillies are also going through hard emotional times as both Shane and Charlie have lost loved ones.That's hard on a human. Even though things look good right now for the Phillies, things might take a turn for the worst.

You see players drafted in the top 10, then complain, and hold out for bigger contracts....there's no longer a love of the game for many athletes.

V6x2x8eVaa	You have some great RB's.  If you have no faith in LT then put him on the trading block, someone will offer you a great player for him.  Same goes for Lynch.  As a note I wouldn't put both of them on the block at the same time. <br>  <br>  I don't like playing Graham, yes I know Seattle is awful, but Tampa does most of its work on defense by keeping the score very low and so they don't score a ton of points.  And Dunn is going to be taking away a few carries and possibly a tragic goal line carry that could be costly for you. <br>  <br>  Thomas Jones is a fantastic play this week.  Oakland is awful and banged up.  Oakland's defense is really bad and their offense is even worse.  Jones will see a ton of work; especially toward the end of the game when the Jets are up big and Jones is driving down the field.<br>  <br>  My second choice at RB would be LT followed closely by Lynch.  Both LT and Lynch are supposed to be studs.  Lynch is almost guaranteed get a score and I would bet that LT will too.  I put LT first because he's actually feeling up to doing all of the team practices for the week, which seems to indicate that his turf toe is almost all better and LT will be back to dominating in no time.<br>  <br>  It sucks that you are 1 and 5, who else is on your team?|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Lynch and Tomlinson. :]|`|cVqCryr6aa	Graham and Jones. High probability at least one will explode. |`|4cda3fbcf47a67dc357a025a36e01e20aa	well first of all dont start parker b/c he is doughfull and siad already he isnt gonna play and so i would start L.T. b/c he might start getting hot and lynch b/c he is always solid and jones b/c he had a heck of a week last week and is projected to get a lot this year i wouldnt start grahm b/c he will split time with dunn
V6x2x8eVaa	Absolutely remove Dunn from that flex as quickly as possible.  With this receiving core you should use 3 WR's.  <br>  Wayne is a must start every week he's playing.<br>  Oakland is terrible so Coles will have a good game.<br>  Santana Moss and Lee Evans are starters in almost every league available, just not mandatory starters like Wayne.<br>  I would probably go with Evans because the Chargers have been giving up a lot of passing yards this year.  <br>  <br>  To summarize:<br>  Wayne<br>  Coles<br>  Evans<br>  Bench Dunn<br>  <br>  I would like to point out that your WR's are all amazing so whomever you decide to play won't be a bad play.<br>  |`|VIfS9Q1Laa	Wayne is must start. Coles is must start. I would also give Moss a try.|`|4cda3fbcf47a67dc357a025a36e01e20aa	Reggie wayne for sure b/c he is playing greenbay who can struggle at times with pass coverage and giving up the big plays <br>  L. coles b/c he is going against Oakland whos passs coverage isnt good at all <br>  Santana moss b.c he is doing really good right now and is on a hot streak|`|SYFDSbFgaa	i would go Reggie Wayne no matter the matchup ( this one is pretty good) and probably santana moss, he should get his share of looks agaisnt the browns and is due for a bounceback 
vdh6cwUvaa	1.

KOUP58W8aa	he'll be fine|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Not a good game to decide on.  Denver's D is not exactly the top in the league.  If he puts in that kind of permormance against a Pittsburgh or Tennessee then he'll deserve some cheering.<br>  |`|UxooffHZaa	I think he'll be a top 10 QB in the league for years to come.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	He gave a solid performance tonight. He was playing the Broncos D, which has made a lot of QB's look good. The most impressive thing I think he did was he made quick decisions and did not make many bad ones. They lost tonight because of Kellen Winslow's inability to hold onto the ball in the 2nd half.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	thats average, considering he wasn't exactly going up against the best defense in the league. if he can pull that off against the colts or the pats, i will be impressed.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Good stats, but really not good enough to replace a pro bowl QB. I like Quinn, but he shouldn't be starting in front of DA.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	They almost won but they'll get better and hopefully the Browns will win some games.|`|dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Like you said, it was against the Broncos defense.  And an injury depleted one too.<br>  <br>  But hey, I think tonight performance proved that Anderson is not completely at fault.<br>  <br>  People got to see all the dropped passes and fumbles (Winslow is guilty of both)...Plus, Quinn didn't air it out but kept it safe most of the time with short passes.  Good game though, but he had better prepare himself for true defenses.|`|Z8hGA5Tgaa	If he can do it against the Steelers D or the Ravens which would make him under real pressure as they would mix up coverages and blitzes. If he can do it against them then yeah he is decent. He did really well though for his first performance way better then Ryan or Flacco did.|`|dywILy7oaa	it is hard to say at the moment. Yes he had good stats but he was playing a struggling defense and he was playing at home. give him some time to develop more. I think he will be and wait till next season when he starts the year as the starter. it will show us how he plays the whole season as the starter and if he can get them in the playoffs|`|YCwmCDkUaa	He'll be fine...no great star, but he'll be ok...<br>  <br>  --------------------------<br>  <br>  LOL @ the Patriots 18-0 being a fluke...well, NO KIDDING...the Dolphins going unbeaten was a fluke too...otherwise they (or other teams) would have done it since then...or before then...<br>  <br>  Dumb comment|`|rXUJuZlSaa	Ryan Lead was great when he started his first game. We will have to see if he can be consistent for the rest of the season before we can say he will be a great QB or not. |`|PaMTtUXbaa	I think he will be okay<br>  <br>  PATRIOTS SUCK! <br>  <br>  The Patriots going 18-0 was a FLUKE! |`|OIFVIm2Laa	He could be, but it was only one game|`|IhuSUSWUaa	He had an impressive start considering he had one full day of practice and Winslow made 3 big mistakes (interference penalty, fumble and dropped pass at the end), but he benefited from a number of things: <br>  <br>  1) Denver's lousy defense without their best corner (Bailey) and starting linebackers<br>  2) He played at home<br>  3) He threw short to intermediate passes.  I know he and Derek Anderson are two different types of QB's, but I didn't see Quinn go downfield at all.  We'll have to see if he can keep defenses honest by throwing deep outs, post patterns, and fly patterns.<br>  <br>  The Monday Night game at Buffalo will be a truer litmus test.  They will play on the road in front of a hostile crowd against a good defense who need to win to keep up in the AFC East.  I'm sure they will stack their defense against short and intermediate passes to make Quinn beat them over the top.<br>  <br>  But I know one thing for sure...  He's not Ryan Leaf!  He's poised, looks like he belongs in the NFL, and doesn't blame teammates for their mistakes.  At times he has happy feet and will move out of the pocket so that needs to be fixed.<br>  |`|nATIgXK6aa	i think he needs to scan the field and look for more people than just Kellen Winslow. Braylon Edwards is a very reliable Wide out. Hes got great speed and good hands. All in all Brady had a ok performance but first day jitters need to be shaken off to keep the starting job.|`|tr5BaA6Paa	Think he did good for being his first ever game and short notice. Even the commentators expected him to fall flat on his face. Guess he proved them wrong. Brown had to start him at some point. He did what he could but if it was not for the fumble and some ez dropped interception they would have blown Denver away.|`|dQ231SwIaa	i don't think them going  16-0 in the regular season was a fluke but anyways a couple of those wins were last second luck outs and the ravens got screwed plus they lost the biggest game of the years so being un defeted in the regular seasons means nothing   <br>  <br>  *18 wins     1  "giant" loss|`|7e2d3abd1a52ec056e93ba45b46fba20aa	He was COURAGEOUS!|`|3MX3w4aMaa	Hard to say, the question is can he be consistent

There will be a lot of energy in that game!
qnfEEpS6aa	make sure you update your roster every day. If a player is on the bench, his stats will not count for that day. So you have to choose your lineups well especially when everyone is playing on the same day. <br>  In regards to not being able to move a player, once a game starts that player is locked for the day. the blue square next to the players name will be faded out meaning that the game is in progress. If the square is solid blue then you can move him. Have fun with it. You'll get used to it later on in the season. Good luck!
AA11586164	Emory .. the English display of bad manners was in league & the Haka is a Greeting & challenge,, not a 'war dance' as such ... But it is a tradition quite a few hundred years old .. not new at all|`|7FSQvDOlaa	Scotland wont beat the ABs unless they get some of that extra power and pace the ABs get  from their Polynesian players. The Southern Hemisphere teams are clearly superior to the Northern teams, and they all have either black or Polynesian players making up about a third to a half of their team. In NZ, white players are traditionally in the tight five, and inside backs, with Polynesians excelling at loose forward and mid-field. Fijians often fill the wing spots. This combination of talents is much stronger than a team that's all white or all Polynesian. It's always been the AB's secret!!|`|WF0VVhNQaa	Umm, no.  Do you think the Scots will be more gracious than the Brits?<br>  I was apalled to see the match between England and New Zealand last night, the Brits turned their backs on the All Blacks during the Haka.<br>  (for those of you who don't know, its a traditional Maori war dance).<br>  Absolutely bad sportsmanship on the part of Brits.  The All Blacks had a well deserved win.<br>  |`|zLBQYSW3aa	I dont think scotland will win but then again anything can happen on any givan day!|`|khjmqXS1aa	hmm anything is possible but i dont think scotland can beat them the all blacks are just two good |`|nqOqaNIEaa	as long as the black have Samoans and do that dance, then no|`|GQpTI2GWaa	No, the AB's are about to bring Dan Carter on and they were ahead even before they brought Richie on.

qnfEEpS6aa	It's pretty decent. I would drop or trade nocioni for another point guard. You lack assists. Calderon will get his but I'm not sure about rondo. 3 point shooting could be a problem as well. Your defensive is pretty solid.
2wrenQfuaa	LOL. No i absolutely want to kill myself after what happened to today. <br>  <br>  Ok first of all there's no way Lebron can be a Piston.

With New York messed up right now, and New Jersey's plans looking like a turn for the worse, I think LeBron will think different.<br>  <br>  Sure, Detroit can clear up plenty of cap space, but Cleveland will have plenty of money in 2010 too.  Danny Ferry has his eye on Chris Bosh to pair up with LeBron in 2010.  I really don't think Detroit has too much appeal for him, especially if the Cavs can win it all this year, or add another superstar in the next couple of years.|`|DAS7OHiTaa	Unlikely...1. is sure...nit sure about 2...<br>  <br>  But as a Detroit Fan,I wouldnt like a SUPERSTAR leading Detoroit,I want The Pistons to Lead Detroit|`|YdGtwBxMaa	I do, Joe Dumars is going to make big things happen in Detroit.

m5nC4aHKaa	Cotchery playing against a lil tougher d than jones is.

Uwv1lPDJaa	i guess ricky williams. the lions have no running game whatsover. the patriots are a pass first, run second team.<br>  <br>  at least ricky williams gets some carries in miami and denvers defense isnt very good.|`|FDkoay7Caa	First of all Dunn is playing for tampa not Atlanta. I don't know that status of Tampas fullbacks but i think they are still out so it depends if they are going to have graham play FB and block for Dunn but if Dunn is starting and getting playing time a would definitely pick him up. My second choice would be Kevin Smith even though hes playing a pretty solid D.|`|9arF0TIEaa	I would go with Kevin smith he had a decent game last week <br>  Oh and Dunn doesn't play 4 Atlanta anymore ( not being mean just yelling the facts )|`|CGP5wbTPaa	Ricky Williams. Denver has a porous run defense.|`|AA11403020	Williams!|`|dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Green is probably getting the start against a horrible Indy defense so I would start him.  Williams is splitting carries with Ronnie Brown, who is the one who gets the TD scores, not Williams.<br>  <br>  If you can go ahead and pick up Dunn...I'm guessing you're talking about Warrick Dunn who's at TB now...But yeah, he's better than any of the RBs you mentioned above.
G7t9Xk0Zaa	Don't do it.  You're getting the short end of the stick.  Yao can't even play in 55 games a season.  You got Camby, the league's leader in blocks and Jose Calderon is a greater prospect now that he's the starting PG.  His numbers are going to be great.  He's offering you junk in return.  KG's numbers are not as spectacular.  He's not in Minnesota anymore.  And Dunleavy can't be compared to any of these guys, Dunleavy is not anywhere near the value of Iguodala, Calderon, or Camby.  Keep Camby, Iggy, and Calderon.  Camby may not be injury prone, but at least he's not injury prone as Yao.  |`|qnfEEpS6aa	I wouldn't do it. you have all the major categories covered(scoring, rebounds, assists) Yao is prone to injuries and dunleavy, well, he's not that good!
nBqZBbtnaa	What happened to Travis Henry?|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	The Broncos should have signed Shaun Alexander. <br>  <br>  But since they waited too long, they are going to have to wait until the off-season to get a decent RB. I would suggest drafting one on the first day. Shannahan's ego has got in the way of him drafting and developing a good RB. He had Clinton Portis, but gave him up because he thought Portis was a product of his system. Since then, he has gone through so many RB's it's pathetic. <br>  <br>  I say they do what they can with what they have and wait for next season. Besides, with that defense, they aren't going very far anyway. <br>  |`|YFFhkRSdaa	yes they should have gotten shaun alexander but its to late now tatum bell no he stole their is nothing in the NFL worse than that than being gay. Mike bell could be a fantastic possibility question is has he stayed in shape?|`|TbO83l3yaa	if youre talking for next season i think we should draft a power back for our first round pick. someone who can bash someone like Marshawn Lynch. |`|AA11928970	i think everyone will be afraid to sign these backs are dropping like flys 
aXSjRwEVaa	I'll go through each of them for you from what I know:<br>  <br>  JG M14- First of all, JG doesn't make an M14 so that website is lying to you.  Most likely it is a Kart M14 or something like that.  I would avoid it.<br>  <br>  AGM MP-40- Interesting collector's piece for WWII fans, but not a great choice for actual use.  It is sub-par quality and very difficult to find magazines for.<br>  <br>  CYMA AK-47- CYMA makes great AK models.  That's all I have to say about that.<br>  <br>  JG M4 CQB- JG makes great Armalite models.<br>  <br>  Go with either of the last two, whichever you prefer.|`|mnahpvtOaa	none of them and also i hate CYMA they sell very cheap guns but there is a gun that is on Airsplat.com and it is the UTG L96 AWP Spring Airsoft Sniper Rifle and it also has a scope and it is only$109.95 |`|Y4mz8BShaa	I'm not a fan of AGM, and them MP40 is a sub machine gun. It wouldn't be too bad for CQB.<br>  I don't trust unnumbered CYMA guns, but that looks pretty good.<br>  M4A1 Carbine if you play MOUT, M14 for field combat.<br>  <br>  It's quite hard to be stealthy with a AEG due to the whine from the gearbox, but if you want a small AEG, get the MP40 or M4A1 Carbine.<br>  <br>  
VriyRjVmaa	Yeh it is true. I'm sure there will be some switching between positions. This has happened to numerous number 10's. James Hook of  Wales has played many games at 12 for instance. Usually they don't work out because 1. they are not used to the position and 2. they can't rely on their number next to them to help out on tackling if they get stuck. <br>  <br>  I think though whoever is playing at 10 because im not 100% sure will be great and have to be class for graham henry to move dan carter to make room for him. I would trust the coaches because lets face it they are outstanding coaches and plenty of countries would kill for them to be in thier staff.|`|zjGRfALRaa	Yeah I saw on the news that he was changing position. Going back to his old position in 2003. I don't know who will be replacing him at fly half though but I hope it will be someone from the under 20s. |`|8QxVjXUxaa	yep, and stephen donald is wearing 10. i think this is a good decision cuz there are two kicking options and both can switch the positions... carter has been in 12 before so mortlock and cross wont run over them.|`|Q46zEPrZaa	Yes, Steve Donald gets his chance at last.<br>  Yes a good decision, Donald is an exciting player Dan might even be better at 2nd Five., we will see.|`|O0p245Zmaa	lol, donald isnt an exciting player, pity Brett has been struck with injuries this year. Donald can win a game, and can lose a game. In the s14 he did some brillent kicks and regathers to score a few tries, then 2 weeks later he does the same thing and gives away 3 tries.|`|AA10413821	Yeah back to his original position when come on to the big scene I think Dan will carve with more space and time. Pending on how Donald plays at 10 on Saturday and what style of play, Dan should fit back into 12 sweet as. Go the ABs|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Yeah, Steven Donald will be playing at fly half. <br>  <br>  Dan Carter will still be a world beater from centre.|`|4c7b9e16b013d7a80f814a8aba5339dcaa	He will be wearing the 12 but they will be interchanging. He started as a second five he's class he will be fine. Steve Donald from Waikato is play 10 but expect them to interchange.
2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	the same thing you've be eating the whole season...right before a big race, it is important not to throw your body any curve balls|`|a60102fe4c6966877ff84e49ec9c9b9caa	Eat your normal healthy diet during the week.  Trying to carboload for a 5k all week doesn't really make any difference - that is for longer races.  The night before the race, go ahead and have your pasta or other carbs of choice.  Avoid large amounts of fiber that day.  Since your race isn't until mid-morning on Saturday, it will important to have a good breakfast with a mixture of carbs and protein.  My preference is usually a bagel or whole wheat toast with almond butter or peanut butter and honey on it and a cup of chocolate milk or some coffee or tea.   Add to it a banana, and your set to go.  Try not to eat too early as you still want to have fuel left by the time you race.  You may need a snack - energy bar, Cliff Shots, banana, etc. an hour or so before your race begins.   15 minutes before the start of the race, eat an energy gel - GU is my favorite.  If you have never used an energy gel, try them out before a run this week.  You can buy them at sporting good stores, REI, and running stores.  |`|Bu6lx93Jaa	you don't want to try something you're not used to. for a 5k i'd reccomend a small portion of oatmeal/porridge/alpen with - IMPORTANT - a little honey! (fast release carb). 3-4 days before i'd drink double the isotonic drinks than normal, but more importantly listen to your body|`|9ULA8r9gaa	For Breakfast, don't experiment. Eat anything that makes you feel good. Try avoiding too much sugar and juice. Water will always be the best.

4cda3fbcf47a67dc357a025a36e01e20aa	matt schaub he is doing really good and with Andre Johnson doing the best he has ever done he will put up big number and going against a team that hasn't won a game he is going to have a field day on them kurt warner is good but Carolina defense is pretty good and Matt Schaub is better then Jake Delhomme so Matt all the way|`|eF60R7DPaa	schaub cincy is 0-7 |`|9ttLI7S5aa	schaub against cincy because did you  see how bad they looked vs pittsburgh<br>  <br>  id normally say warner but manning looked really bad against carolina<br>  <br>  |`|2i2wzveqaa	I like and have Kurt Warner as well. He is averaging 2 td's a game. Play Kurt against Carolina.|`|TtWM6KEbaa	Kurt Warner.
l9jYuPDqaa	Ok,<br>  Those bullets are just fake inserts. It shoots 6mm just like any others.<br>  <br>  The only exception is Maurishin. They make 8mm stuff.|`|EcqG1Yanaa	those are fake.  it shoots the 6mm|`|TbO83l3yaa	the bullet size for every airsoft gun is 6mm. you can also get them in different weights like .10, .12, .15, .18, .20 and all the way up to like 35. for an AEG use high grade .20 gram bbs |`|LOffoY9xaa	those are fake bullets? 
Uwv1lPDJaa	NO. dont drop Big Ben. the way the steelers offense is now, is they use the run to set up big pass plays down field. he will get you some points. david garrard isnt playing as well as he was last year. Pennington isnt bad but Big Ben is better|`|FDkoay7Caa	I would stick with Big Ben as a backup, i wouldn't make any moves|`|9arF0TIEaa	No no no no no no keep him just start jay cause he has eddie and tony<br>  they will be good 4 him so DONT DROP BEN|`|I40sBgWqaa	I would try and trade big Ben........Try to get Shaub or Campbell......If you drop Edge....I would try to get more then just hightower for him......Always try to trade your stars before you drop them...its better to something for them then nothing.
gz2M5hsBaa	The All-Blacks should be able to do it. It will be a cakewalk against most of the teams. The only teams that they play with a good chance of winning are Munster and Ireland, but they'll need plenty of rain to have a chance of winning. Otherwise the All-Black backs will walk over them. England are capable of winning, but they'll need Wilkinson to have a realistic chance. As for Scotland, they've been trying to get a win for over 100 years and they'll be trying for the next 100. I don't think Wales have the depth to beat the All-Blacks. They have some talented players capable of pushing the All-Blacks and they might pull an upset, but it doesn't seem likely.|`|8IZZ4yENaa	Yeah they will achieve it, but i think the biggest game will be against Wales, I watched the game the other night and i thought that the AB's could have done more in th first half, but of course they picked it up and won, they cannot afford to do this against wales or england|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	I beleive they will get the grand slam and do it easily. The midweek all blacks side will look just as damaging as the main squad they have alot of in form young players that will stand up. Cant wait to see hika elliot at hooker and cory jane at the back |`|8nIEuXplaa	Grand Slam to AB's Yes<br>  Dont believe it willbe a walk over, rather a moderately fast paced Run over|`|zXK9hVCPaa	Its certainly worth a bet.|`|P9FmUtpqaa	The only tough games we'll have is when Ted Henry plays his rotation card, & it takes the ABs til the second half of the game to gel properly.<br>  If the host nations field their strongest teams there may be some resistance, but not enough to cause any upsets.<br>  I feel wales will be our bogey team, & munster may scare us for a few minutes.|`|AA11586164	yes the AB's can do another grandslam ,if they stay concentrated ... look at the 1st 1/2 v Aussie .. they played badly , but later, gelled a bit better & we was history from then on.. The NH teams have an uphill battle & it will b interesting to see if  they can topple the worlds best team,, cos the AB's r the pinacle team ..go the Aussies grandslam tour from u 2 ??.. It would b magical|`|JLcrheVlaa	Of course they can easily,the Wallies made a big thing about them having new players, the ABs also are rebuilding, and look at their results, it'll be a good test for them, and they'll FLY in.|`|0JAw1OPXaa	They may as well go for it, because they can't win a World Cup.|`|duHHqCifaa	they might screw up to England but then again they might not!|`|4c7b9e16b013d7a80f814a8aba5339dcaa	Yes with very little trouble.
yeYwfkC0aa	Your friend is right. Think of it...if your shooting high you need to pitch the bow down more slightly, so by raising your sight pin you have to lower to bring the pin onto the target. Same goes if your shooting left...if you move the pin left it forces you to actually have to bring the bow more to the right until the pin is on the target again. Only shoot 3-5 shots in a row as fatigue will cause you to shake slightly more each time (even the most experience shooters know this) take quick 5-10 minutes breaks and you'll get a more accurate shot reading while sighting in your bow.|`|QC2NozBkaa	Shoot a few arrows until you get a group and then move your pin towards the group.  For example, if your group is high and right, move the sight pin up and right.  |`|HkMhWvtgaa	I know at first it goes against intuition to say "if you're shooting high, move your sight up."  But to help you understand that, try holding your bow out as if drawn.  (You don't actually need to draw the string for this; just hold the "stick" out at full arm's length as it would be at full draw.)  Aim the sight at the center of your target.  See where your bow is?  Now, suppose your arrow was hitting high.  That means you must aim lower.  Move your arm down a bit.  The sight is no longer on the bullseye.  Where would it have to be in order for it to be there?  That's right!  Higher than it is now.  So if you're shooting high, move the sight high.  If you're shooting left, move the sight left.  and so on.<br>  <br>  I'm not very good at spatial things, so I find that there's a trick that keeps me from getting confused about which way to twist the screw to move the sight left or right:  After shooting my group, I hold the bow string-down so the pin points straight at my chest.  I loosen the sight so that I can twist the screw, then turn the screw TOWARD the arrows.  Don't forget to tighten the sight again, very carefully, so that you don't lose your up and down spot!|`|fSJrgVU7aa	In sighting a bow you use the rule "follow your arrow". If you are shooting high, move the sight up, etc. This is opposite of how you sight most rifles for this reason: On most rifles you are adjusting the rear sight..the direction you move the sight is the direction your hit will move on the target. On a bow you are adjusting the FRONT sight so your hit on the target will move opposite of the direction you move the sight. The other biggest tip would be to acquire consistency. Stand, hold, and release exactly the same for every shot. When most of your shots are in a nice tight group, then start adjusting your sights. Hope this helps clarify.|`|lObEjUh1aa	if this is a new bow (or there has been any change to arrows or bow draw length), it will need more than just a sight-in.  it will need to be paper-tuned before doing anything with sights:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thunder.prohosting.com/~mfoster/archery/tunning.html" rel="nofollow">http://thunder.prohosting.com/~mfoster/a...</a><br>  <br>  once paper tuned, sighting in is pretty much a "follow the arrow" process:<br>  <br>  if your arrows hit high of target, adjust your sights up a bit.<br>  if your arrows hit below target, adjust your sights down a bit.<br>  <br>  if your arrows hit left or right of target:<br>  <br>  1.  check to be sure your arrows match your bow (for draw weight and length)<br>  <br>  2.  check to make sure your arrows are straight (very cheap or worn arrows are usually significantly out of true)<br>  <br>  3.  be sure you are not too close to target (arrows "flutter" for about the first 10 yards of flight before straightening out; shooting too close will produce weird strikes on the target)<br>  <br>  4.  be sure your draw weight is not too heavy for your level of strength (this is the most common mistake made by new archers; straining creates poor form and makes arrows go anywhere but straight)<br>  <br>  5.  confirm your arrow is not striking any part of the bow as it launches (easy way to do this is spray some foot powder on the last 6 inches or so of the arrow, including the fletching; if the arrow leaves white powder marks on your bow, it's striking the bow as it launches and being knocked off course)<br>  <br>  6.  consider hiring an archery coach to help you with technique and/or spot any issues with your bow/arrow configuration.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps; good luck!|`|HXQCpuFWaa	i found this info this will help you out<br>  go a get a river bottom 3D target at bass pro shop<br>  <br>  and also have a salesman help you out too i had that done<br>  at bass pro shop

A2zhAYNmaa	for the week before a race, i would reccomend doing cutdowns... do a ten minute warm up, then do one 4 hundred at a hard pace and get to almost full recovery, then repeat the four hundreds. on the first day do 8, then 6, then 4, then two, and then an easy run before the race day. it really works... i dropped my 5K from 24.00 to 21.13 in a week because of these.|`|oGBEl25jaa	you probably wont drop it 5 minutes unless you are very gifted. even if you train it will be difficult|`|7R7e6yX5aa	 Do some weight training and yoga in combination with running|`|lRWdG4l3aa	run 4 miles a day and always try to go super fast because its just practice. or this may look stupid but attach a kite to your back so when you run you produce drag. it serioulsy helps if you run like that everyday.<br>  <br>  and do like around the track a 800 sprint. or 400. as fast as possible!<br>  eat healthy and do your best!<br>  good luck!|`|2R5IO1Djaa	Each day start at 5k and increase it slowly but do it fast.

He suggests you build endurance by running a longer range 2 or 3 times per week.  2 days devote to cardio work outs at the gym (to include strengthening exercises such as weights) and one day sprinting.  <br>  He recommends taking 1 day a week off, but making sure you are eating healthy and pumping those carbs during race times.  Also when it is a week or two from the marathon or competition, he recommends working out every day, to include long distance runs in the morning and strengthening exercises in the evenings.<br>  Good Luck, sounds like you are doing quite well for your age group.  He has also recommended training with one of the HS coaches.  They normally will allow you to attend their trainings provided you are interested in joining them soon.  You could get a personal trainer but that would def cost you some $$$.|`|sGdSTTJJaa	i am a freshman in highschool. i run 22's and i took 5 minutes off of my time. haha that is alot. our team has long runs on mondays, workouts of shorter distances like 800's 400's&& 1k's on tuesday thursday and on wednesday and friday, we run easy like 4-5 miles.|`|JLvftKu6aa	well thaats great! im a varsity sophmore runner and i run a 18:47 5K but i started were u were! so never give up and keep practicing and u can bcome just like meee!:D|`|oA51plewaa	I believe all things are possible.  I may be a masters runner at this time but my PR has been 17:50 for a 5k and I started off unable to run an entire 2 miles without stopping as a young person at 13yrs. old.  One of my concerns is your age I do believe you need to give yourself some time. Below you will find some resources that I think will be helpful to you but in the meantime I would consider the following items in reference to your running program:<br>  <br>  Nutrition<br>  Strenght training and weights<br>  Form work (sprints,butt kicks,etc)<br>  Track workouts and hills<br>  <br>

Johnson's been a beast all year, and no one can stop him.  White gets some carries, but Johnsons the main running back.  And sure the Chargers DST is bad, but I'm positive they wont allow 80 yards and one TD to a no-name.  LJ maybe, but not Jamaal Charles.

pKX0lfMzaa	Three wrestlers -- Jericho, Hunter and Shawn.<br>  <br>  The three of these wrestlers work wonders together no matter what the pair is. We've seen Jericho and Shawn work the mic at it's best last year and years before this (during their feud at the time of WM 19). Shawn and Hunter are another example as we've seen these two in the past (during their feud at Summer Slam) and so on. These two also work greatly on the mic. Jericho and Hunter as well work together fantastic. <br>  <br>  The thing these three men have is great chemistry and charisma. They can drive the crowd at any emotion they please to take them (making it more believable). Another thing these three can do is develop a current storyline to it's maximum potential. No matter what anyone says they just have to listen to these three when on the mic. They get the attention they need quickly and will play into your head (meaning to get you to either be on their side or against them). Which brings up my final supporting detail, no matter if their face or heel, they will work wonders and get anyone's attention.<br>  <br>  Who do I think have the best chemistry together on the mic? Arguably Shawn and Jericho have the edge over these two with Hunter. That's just how I see it, despite Shawn and Hunter being phenomenal together.<br>  <br>  Runner Up -- Orton, Cena and Edge.<br>  <br>  Vintage Answer.|`|m68HTA4paa	jbl and shawn had great chemistry recently. <br>  jericho's had great chemistry with all the legends who have showed up recently as well.<br>  those are the two that come to mind right now.|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Cena and Edge<br>  Triple H and Randy (Shorten) Orton<br>  Undertaker and HBK<br>  Stone Cold and Vince|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the rock dx (hbk and hhh) and undertaker<br>  <br>  edge and chris jericho<br>  randy orton triple h<br>  christan and kane|`|41WXZPnCaa	The MEM And The Frontline<br>  Randy Orton And HHH<br>  Rated RKO And DX|`|rseD4OG2aa	I'm always entertained by John Cena and Edge, but both of them are so good that they do well no matter who they're paired with.<br>  I'm not a Triple H fan, but Shawn Michaels and Triple H are fantastic together. They always make me laugh whenever they have those backstage promos or when DX reunites for one or two shows.<br>  I was really surprised at how well Shawn and The Undertaker did on that promo last night. It was so emotionally charged and they both pulled it off brilliantly. I loved it when Shawn knew Undertaker was in the ring with him, and when he cut him off at the rest in piece moment. <br>  You're right about Christian, he's been fantastic. He's been helping Jack Swagger a ton since he returned. I know that it's over now, but I also loved MVP and Matt Hardy. Those contests they did were hilarious because MVP was so good on the mic. <br>  I know I'm listing a lot here, but it's also tough not to go with Shawn and Jericho or Shawn and JBL. They were great as well.<br>  I think that the best mic workers overall are John Cena, Edge, Triple H, MVP, Chris Jericho and Christian. They're all fantastic.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I always thought that The Rock and HHH had great chemistry together.<br>  <br>  Kurt Angle worked well with just about anyone, but especially Chris Jericho when Y2J was face.<br>  <br>  Stone Cold and Vince did some great stuff together also.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Cena and Orton<br>  Edge and Cena<br>  Orton and HHH|`|ULSUqmeZaa	HHH and HBK.

pKX0lfMzaa	I do want to see Punk win another year, but then again I want to see the others win as well because half of them are my favorites (biased choices of mine). If he were to win this year, I wouldn't mind that happening. The only thing that would cross my mind is how he would get booked by winning it. Will the same thing happen to him like the first time he won? That's just something I rather not want to see, besides we need to see a new fresh winner of the match.<br>  <br>  Leading to the following question, I can see him transition into the heel role if he were to win the match. I can even see him do the transition without winning the match. Here are possibilities:<br>  <br>  Winning -- Whoever the face champion is, he'll capture it in like how Edge did before and win it. He would then change his sense of attitude and so on. This might not get him over as a heel right away, but it'll work.<br>  <br>  Losing -- First losing the IC title, then the bank match. He could change his attitude once he loses another match and starts to blame the fans. That right there would get him over quick. <br>  <br>  Vintage Answer.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	I think once is enough to be honest.<br>  <br>  Give another superstar a chance, for example, Kofi Kington: who i believe is highly under-rated. Or for once, let one of the heavyweights win it, a heel for instance.<br>  <br>  Im unsure about the heel aspect though. I cant see his persona being modified that durastically.<br>  <br>  Good question (*)|`|rzuXnXIMaa	I've Got *Spoiler*............<br>  <br>  CM Punk Is Gonna Be DRAFTED 2 Smackdown..............at This Year's WWE Draft & He'll Be In The Main Event Scenarios Again<br>  This Year.. Thats Y He "Dropped" Title To JBL...........<br>   <br>  & I Think Shelton Benajamin is gonna win this Year B'coz He Has Tried Every Year But Came Up Short.................Gotcha !!!|`|6ueL0gkAaa	I'd like to see Punk go heel, since he was a great heel on the indy circuit, but as far as winning MITB, no. He won last year.|`|w9tkdE4Oaa	I want him to but he probs wont cos he won last year's|`|m68HTA4paa	he won it last year. give someone else a chance.|`|52luRGoVaa	no|`|FEViNlQMaa	I don't think so because that will be unfair and Kane should win it. Maybe Punk will get drafted on Smackdown and then turn HEEL to get the WWE belt.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	As Obama would say, "we need change!"|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	If Punk turns heel during the MITB match, that makes the possibility of him winning more interesting than that possibility currently is, but there are two reasons why I still wouldn't want him to win:<br>  1. He won last year.  I don't want to see him win in consecutive years.<br>  2. He's still using the GTS, which is the one thing preventing me from returning to his fan base (in fact, that's the thing that made me leave his fan base when he first introduced the move).<br>  <br>  If Punk changes his finisher before WrestleMania 26, there would then be a strong likelihood that I would want him to win that MITB.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Want? - Hell Yeah!<br>  But It's Not Gonna Happen.<br>  They Aren't gonna Give the Same Person MiTB Twice , & Sure as Hell Not 2 Years in a Row.<br>  <br>  <br>  Heel? - Oh Please , Let's All Pray...<br>  I can Only Dream of the Day Punk Turns Heel in WWE.<br>  Then All the WWE Marks who Think He Sucks & Can't Cut a Promo , or Wrestle , Will Finally Shut the Hell Up.<br>  CM Punk as a Heel = Pure Entertainment & Awesomeness.<br>  He'll F'N OWN Anyone.<br>  Well , Even if He IS a Heel , It'll Never be as Good as His Indy Heel Gimmick , Not with the Restrictions Vince Has Anyway...|`|khU8m4gxaa	I like Punk, but he won it in '08. It's should be someone else's chance. I would like to see a heel turn from Punk though. He's worked well as a heel in ROH, and his character needs something fresh. He's lost clean too often as a face.|`|41WXZPnCaa	NOT AGAIN<br>  <br>  THis Is MVP'S Time<br>  <br>  And Punk As Heel I Don't Think So|`|4YcZv0d7aa	I wouldn't want him to win actually. He just had a good run as the Intercontinental Champion and I think he had his time in the sun for a while. I honestly hate when they keep giving the same people the chance at a championship. That is exactly why I lost some respect for the WWE Title and World Title. Those two titles are stale. <br>  <br>  So, I think that someone else should get a chance. Either someone who hasn't had a chance yet or someone who hasn't had a chance in a long time. Shake things up a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the next question:<br>  <br>  I actually think of CM Punk as similar to John Cena. Not in looks or  ability, but just in personality. He is too much of a fan favorite to be a good heel. I would like to see them attempt to make him a heel, but I couldn't see it sticking with him too long. Just like Cena when he kept saying how he didn't care what the fans thought. That heel turn lasted a whole 2 weeks. So, I think CM Punk being a heel could be attempted, but not really sticking. Kofi Kingston on the other hand, yes I could see him as a heel.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I actually want Christian to win MITB. He needs to reestablish himself to the newer WWE fans. He's got a lot of talent and Charisma and the WWE could use him as one of the next top guys.<br>  <br>  But I also think MVP deserves a title shot. Maybe not a world title just yet...but at least a title shot.|`|MkvjMaA8aa	No I Dont Want Punk To Win This Year I Want Chrisitian(He Had Won Battle Royal On ECW) Or Kane This Year!<br>  I Dont Want Punk To Become A Heel In This Process!|`|3d9d6884d0874ab328f3fd0d9774f48eaa	Heel turn yes, win MITB no.  I think either hristian or MVP will win it.

I'd rather like to see an MVP or a Christian (if he goes in) to win it.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	CM Punk has had his turn at MITB.<br>  He could turn heel because he doesn't win though?|`|W8SgRKo7aa	turn heel but not win MITB
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	7 point underdogs.  They already beat PIttsburgh last year, essentially with the same personnel.  I believe it was also IN Pittsburgh.  Regular season, division, all that is out the window.  Its a 4 game season now an the Cards are 3-0.   The Cardinals can win this game.  If the Giants of last year can beat New England, the Cardinals can definetly beat Pittsburgh|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	Remember the Giants last year? Upsetting the (then) undefeated Patriots on David Tyree's miracle catch? GREATEST SUPER BOWL EVER.<br>  <br>  Here's my prediction. Cards will be down by 3 in the final 2 minutes of the game, but an unknown WR will catch the ball against his chest, and Larry Fitzgerald will score the winning TD.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	No, The Jets victory over the Colts is|`|qfVE2KFtaa	It's a shock that the Cardinals are here in the SB,but that's about it|`|nDUTP8TSaa	Not even close. The Steelers are only favored by 7. The Cards QB has been to two previous Superbowls therefore has the experience. The biggest upset was last years Giants over the Patriots.|`|gBfPkdroaa	hmmm i think it'll be the 2nd biggest upset?<br>  <br>  last year was THEE UPSET of the NFL.<br>  <br>  16-1....how disappointing.<br>  <br>  <br>  lets go ARIZONA!|`|CTEQMXFwaa	This wouldn't be an upset. The Cardinals are every bit as good as the Steelers, even though their record isn't as good. Media loves the Steelers.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	No.  The Giants beating the Patriots was the biggest upset.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Not even close. They aren't huge underdogs- it is less than a TD. There have been spreads up to like 17 points in Super Bowls, with many 10+ point spreads.|`|AA11881188	No. Last years was a pretty big upset, but Super Bowl III with the Jets beating the Colts would have to be the biggest.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Since when is 6 1/2 points a HUGE underdog?<br>  <br>  And I agree with the first guy...they won't win anyway.|`|XzisJYoAaa	not as big as last years or win the jets beat the colts.but yes it will be huge WHEN they win|`|UNLrYNeUaa	no, the biggest "upset" was last year supposedly, even though I picked the giants to win and everybody else just couldn't believe when it happened, well anyway the cardinals will win this one by at least 10 points, the cards defense will put a lot of pressure on rothlisberger, and whisenhunt was with the last steelers superbowl team so he'll know what to expect from them|`|aDzaySX0aa	Irrelevent question, the Steelers are going to win.|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	no|`|hiJaXOD5aa	Probably.  I will be shocked if the Cards won.|`|L77OlY1naa	NO|`|Q1MI6L96aa	From where the team came from - champion of maybe the weakest division in the NFL, stumbling down the stretch of the regular season, underdog in all of the playoff games....a victory will be second to the Jets over the Colts in SP III, which made the AFL relevant as a league and showed that a merger would not be a joke.

lPDHMOVZaa	Manny isn't a "pass-rushing" linebacker... since that is what he was brought in to be, I guess you could call him a bust... but since his NFL debut, Manny has become a very good coverage linebacker and has given the 49ers versatility at the position, so I wouldn't call him a complete bust. <br>  <br>  If Oher falls to 10, than that's who I want the 49ers to draft. Or any of the "big 4" offensive tackles for that matter (Smith/Smith/Oher/Monroe). If all 4 of them are gone, than I'd like to see the 49ers take the best available defensive player... B.J. Raji, Everette Brown, Brian Orakpo, Vontae Davis or Malcolm Jenkins preferably... I'd say Aaron Curry, but we all know he's gone in the top 5. <br>  <br>  Either way, one of these 10 guys will be there... and whoever that is, I'd like to see the 49ers take him. I absolutely do not want them to draft Stafford or Sanchez... the last thing the 49ers need is another "pre-madonna" quarterback who thinks he's hot sh*t.|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	I think this is Lawson's make or break season.  He must play well and stay healthy or I think the 49ers will cut him loose next season.  When it comes to the draft, as long as they don't draft a quarterback with their first pick, they'll be fine because I don't think Stafford or Sanchez is much of an upgrade over Shaun Hill.|`|Lg4BkwWOaa	i think that he will get better over time....but ur right about the pass rushing part|`|jLnXuam7aa	Manny has to step up this year or he is a bust, and I agree that we should get one of the top OT or Brian Orakpo  he is a beast  im not sold on matt stafford or Sanchez for the Niners

8a04SlZTaa	les arbitres commence serieusement a me gonflé.|`|kjfxInyzaa	l'arbitre est une personne neutre qui doit veiller au bon déroulement des épreuves et au respect des règlements et autres lois du jeu......<br>  bah il faut 1 5éme arbitre ou plus.........|`|9fc125f9c55fe12c3dfbb92d65f426aaaa	SI on pouvait plut?t acheter un cerveau aux supporters...|`|e3cfa3212b3f1e22526595c4b899ca5baa	non il faudrait que tous les abrutis qui crient dans la tribune essaie un jour d'arbitrer comme ca ils auraient l'occasion de fermer leur bouche quand l'arbitre se trompe. Et les gars faut pas oublier que les joueurs se trompent aussi sur le terrain mais c'est vrai c'est plus facile de taper sur l'arbitre. Allez va vous pouvez continuer et puis c'est vrai en France, on a les arbitres qui vont avec le niveau du championnat de football.|`|d87b8661ae4c9a192d7acccd5bd14913aa	C'est surtout aux abrites de touche de faire quelque chose !! ces branleurs n'ont que ?a a faire de tout le match, à savoir courir le long d'une ligne et ils sont incapable de voire des HJ quand il y en a ou ils en voie quand il n'y en a pas et ne voie même pas les ballons quand ils passent la ligne !|`|209wTqsqaa	vous le connaissez le règlement personnellement je doute. Entièrement d'accord avec guillaume 76.<br>  On manque dèjà d'arbitres, quand ce serait le cas avec 5 arbitres on aura besoin de vous et là on va rigoler!!!!|`|RPXhMS5Faa	Ben allez vous mêmes les passer les examens.. Il manque d'arbitres dans les divisions régionales et départementales...|`|q84V9Qpcaa	Arbitrage à 5 ?<br>  <br>  On a pas l'impression que l'arbitrage est à 3 déjà. Alors à 5 ... Je pense pas qu'on puisse voir un arbitrage à 3 comme en rugby car, dès qu'il y aura la moindre discussion entre deux arbitres, y aura 6 joueurs autour pour les persuadés de tout et du contraire. Il faudrai déjà qu'ils ait les armes pour gérer la discipline. <br>  <br>  Seulement avec un jaune qui est une demi-expulsion, on met pas un jaune juste pour arriver comme une balle vers l'arbitre et s'arréter à 10 cm, ou un mot qui n'a pas lieu d'être.<br>  Il faut des règles disciplinaires, ce qui n'existe pas, à l'heure actuelle, homis mettre un jaune si un joueur à une maucvaise attitude envers l'arbitre.  Deux règles supplémentaires : <br>  1 carton jaune pour indiscipline, 1 carton orange pour remplacer le carton jaune actuel (1 orange + 1 jaune = 1 rouge) <br>  Si il y a protestation sur un coup franc, une faute, une touche, un corner, un hors jeu, l'équipe adverse a le droit de déplacer le ballon dans un cercle de 10 m autour du point de faute.<br>  <br>  Point barre. L'arbitre est celui qui dirige le match. Ce n'est pas les supporters ou les médias.<br>  <br>  Edit : pour revenire à la question, un examen plus dur ? on manque déjà d'arbitre....<br>  <br>  Edit 2 : j'oubliai pour que ce soit compréhensible : 1 orange = 2 jaunes = 10 minutes d'expulsion.|`|vV5tl7Khaa	c'est clair... psg valencienne hier, la frappe de sessegnon etait dedans mais ppffff. voila comment on perd 2points importants. je leur dit merde a ces arbitre. <br>  de toute fa?on bientot l'arbitrage a 5 alors on espere encore..|`|k03iw3NEaa	Il y a une technologie que l'on pourrait se servir à je ne sais plus le nom.

xRaGyugTaa	après avoir lu sa biographie je dis un grand OUI :) <br>  <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Carrasso" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric...</a>|`|209wTqsqaa	Carrasso est meilleur que Mandanda, il ne serait pas blessé la saison dernière personne ne connaitrait Mandanda. <br>  <br>  Dommage qu'il se soit blessé!|`|8kf5jmwBaa	je ne suis d'accord avec toi que sur un point !!!!<br>  MANDANDA EST NULLLL !!!!!<br>  On aurait du garder cedric carasso, je n'ai jamais aimé mandanda<br>  Et pour l'équipe de france, laisser lloris faire ses preuves, en attendant il n'ont qu'a mettre FREY, c'est un monstre dans les cages de la fiorentina !!!!|`|OC9skfG1aa	non !|`|OHiga0Buaa	T'es tombé dans le panneau toi aussi!<br>  Encore toi tu n'as aucune influence (et aucune connaissance en ballon non plus), mais à causse de gens comme toi (surtout quand c'est des journalistes) les jeunes sportifs (pas encore fini dans leurs stabilité affective) montent et descendent dans leurs performances et, de là, dans l'estime des autres.<br>  Tu es de ceux qui changent d'idole avec le vent et qui détestent l'OM (suivez mon regard).<br>  Objectivement, tu crois vraiment que l'équipe de France dans son contexte actuel peut permettre à un grand joueur de s'exprimer?!!<br>  |`|83a1711a243266ff8e6ddd8362027b9aaa	Sans hésitation oui. Je suis d'accord avec toi sur tout sauf pour Lloris qui a un talent énorme pour moi.<br>  <br>  Mais Mandanda est une chèvre qui a bénéficié d'un extraordinaire matraquage médiatique depuis 1 an sous prétexte qu'il joue dans le club fran?ais le plus populaire :l'OM.<br>  <br>  Et qu'on ne me dit pas que c'est seulement à cause de sa défense.<br>  Une stat terrible pour lui : en EDF, sur les 3 matchs éliminatoires qu'il a joué, les adversaires de l'EDF (Autriche, Serbie et Roumanie) ont cadré 6 tirs pour.....6 buts!!|`|x4lIR3mEaa	ma réponse est OUI, Carasso est un excellent gardien qui a joué de malchance l'an passé.<br>  Mandanda est un bon gardien mais assez limité et pas assez complet à mon sens.<br>  <br>  En revanche, je ne suis pas d'accord avec toi sur Lloris qui est gardien très complet qui a terme sera sans doute le n°1 fran?ais. il va continuer à progresser au contact de Joel Bats comme ce fut le cas pour Lama au PSG et Coupet à Lyon.<br>  <br>  Pelé est un très bon gardien, mais irrégulier qui est capable de se trouer par moment, il ne mérite pas d'être n°1 en EDF, jamais de la vie !!!!|`|2QxuQ46Uaa	Le meilleur gardien pour les Bleus en 2010 serait, à mon sens, Sébastien Frey. Il y a surement moyen de le faire revenir sur sa décision d'arrêter la sélection, encore faut-il que le coach le veuille...<br>  <br>  Mandanda a perdu de sa splendeur comparé à l'an dernier, Lloris est trop irrégulier, quand à Pelé.. bah why not pour lui après tout ?|`|DNmHbd7Xaa	Mandanda n'est probablement pas le meilleur gardien fran?ais, mais de là à dire qu'il est une chèvre ! N'importe quoi. Vive l'objectivité.<br>  <br>  |`|mkFUzbzcaa	et gnagnagna gnagnagnagna<br>  <br>  et dino zoff est il meilleur que pierluigi bouffon|`|6e255b2f7254ea77579ccddd961c049eaa	non|`|EWnoQmWAaa	Cedric Carrasso est un très bon gardien et les personnes réellement connaisseuses le savent même s'il leur est difficile à leur faire dire.<br>  Steve Mandanda et Hugo Lloris ont cependant plus de potentiels que Carrasso.<br>  J'adorerais que Cedric revienne à Marseille une fois que Mandanda aura quitté l'OM pour certainement rejoindre la premiere league qu'il lui fait les yeux doux car il connait le club , adore le club etc ....|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Non. Carasso est un bon gardien ?a n'enlève rien à ses qualités mais Mandanda est à mon sens meilleur. Le portier marseillais traverse une petite crise de confiance mais on a vu la saison passée de quoi il était capable reléguant Carasso sur le banc. Oui l'OM encaisse plus de buts que Toulouse mais l'organisation des deux équipes est totalement différente. Toulouse défend en bloc avec une charnière centrale très  alors que Marseille' est une équipe défensive où la défense est souvent livrée à elle-même.

Until then, sit back down and shut up.|`|eHIJV2k6aa	i am a heat fan so i will be truthful. The celtics are amazing and there is no team in the nba that can stop them from going all the way. they won 19 straight then had to go to LA in 48 hours to play the 2nd best team in the nba (celtics first). thats a hard thing to do but ur right about no upside. the celtics gotta win this year or next year or else they aint goin anywhere for a while|`|gbcRV8eeaa	They can suck it lol! we r the champions this year and we have the best or second best player in the world, kobe who is in our city, period.We had the best and still do have the best players in basketball history, the person who mastered the hook shot, the person who scored 100 points, the person who hit numerous records including 81 points, the man who was the play-making and assisting master, and etc....! who u have? ok i'll admit u HAD good players, but never like our players and u never will so shut it!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sri2eytDaa	oh sorry what was that?

NIqJlo9Baa	I agree with you on alot of the things that you say.  The fans in the college game are way more in to the game.  The players seem to play with more passion.  And, they are definately not playing for money at the college level, HOWEVER:<br>  <br>  I think that the pro game is better.  You seem pretty smart and bring up a lot of good points, but you cannot argue the fact that the talent level is head and shoulders better in the NBA.  Sometimes they do play relaxed defense and sometimes they dont play with the same intensity, but you do not see kobe vs lebron, or CP3 vs Tony Parker in college.  There is no Amare vs Dwight Howard in the college game.  and even if there was, they would be young immature kids who have not reached their full potential yet. The pros are the best players in the world AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME.  To me, that is what makes a game great.  When during the last three seconds, the game is tied, and everyone knows Kobe is going to take it right to Garnett.  <br>  <br>  It may be less selfish in college, and the star may pass it to the open man for a jumper, but thats not what i want to see.  And who cares about their jerseys, lol.|`|1a4f8OD1aa	I love the NCAA so much more then the NBA. even the 99 percent of the players in the ncaa don't compare to the NBA  players. in college they are willing at sacrifice everything not to win a game but to just get a loose ball. or grab a board. i love the passion of the game in college and i love everything about it. in the NBA if its not the pistons or the playoffs i wont even watch it. with college i will watch horizon basketball championship. witch is on tomorrow night.|`|52luRGoVaa	a little bit, but so what if  pros are just doing it for money? if your good enough to get drafted, that's pretty much it, you can just sleep in your house throughout your pro career like andrew bynum, he's always injured. ncaa players needs to look good in front of scouts that's why they're so passionate about it, pros don't need to impress anyone, they get paid either way.|`|3bd3d6c24c39616e8221985f212c2c13aa	regardless the NBA pros still get paid and don't rely on stupid"rankins by idots who probably didnt even watch their games like the Bull CS in college football.<br>  <br>  Plus 75-80 percent of college basketball players will never step on an NBA court to play.<br>  <br>  the nba is much more competitve theres actual jobs on the line for the players since they get paid.|`|wd7XuvKnaa	exactly<br>  <br>  College Hoops is much better for several reasons:<br>  <br>  1.The players play for school pride not for Money. NBA players are greedy, College kids just want to be noticed by the scouts and writers.<br>  <br>  2.College Team Rivalries are way more intense. Duke vs. UNC is much more intense than Celtics vs. Lakers. Thats a fact. There are no bandwagon College Fans.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but I'm gonna stop here.|`|SaCMyfHPaa	I only watch college,  my simple thought on that is college players play with passion and  intensity because they want to go pro and get that big contract, or they know they wont go pro and want to enjoy the ride.  NBA players already have the big money and its easy for them to forget what the game is all about|`|G38ltd04aa	Any professional league is a joke...because they are controlled by politics and gambling...<br>  <br>  NFL = Big Joke<br>  NBA = Big Joke<br>  NHL = Big Joke<br>  MLB = Biggest joke of all...|`|JV2mxI75aa	i like some thing about ncaa but there other things i hate about it|`|bda90fe4a3f3926b8f365b8127d043c2aa	It's true that some teams don't play defense, but most teams make the effort to do so.<br>  <br>  If I were a player I would perform well so I won't lose my job.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I love the torney, because it is one and done,  you cannot take a day off in the collegiate championship hunt so the games are more exciting and more upsets happens.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	They play that way because they aren't already financially secure. They play that hard to hopefully get a chance to play in the NBA.<br>  <br>  You don't really see NBA players play like the College guys because they are already set. What is really going to motivate you after you are getting millions?<br>  <br>  There are a few player in the NBA who are motivated by just improving there game every year like a Kobe, CP3, Howard, Wade, James. They are all great players and really stand out because they always play their hardest. Most players in the league don't play their hardest for the reason I just mentioned. It's a shame too.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	I hate watching college basketball .

hxQaqSvkaa	Premier Spirit is soooo awesome. I used to cheer there and my cousin cheers at spark. She likes it but when i went to take some extra clinics to spark i didnt like it. They were all like way too serious and no one was like talking, and if you even like laughed too much they would get mad. Premier is serious but laid back. They teach proper technique and have hilarious coaches. I made so many friends and was crushed to leave them when i started HS cheer. I was in Senior Coed Lvl 5!! They both cost about the same just like $200 dollar difference a year bit it depends on what team your on. Go Premier!!

If it is a stress fracture, you are making it worse by running on it or simply taking a week off.  Be sure to ice it after you exercise to reduce any swelling, and good luck healing. |`|5ckCEw6taa	Stress fractures are horrible, i know this from experience, i had mine in January of this year and was not back running until July/ August.  <br>  <br>  The test is to hop if it hurts then sorry but it is a stress fracture or plantifatiatis. If its bruised on top it certainley is a stress fracture. <br>  <br>  You need to stop doing all weight bearing exersice i.e running, walking etc.  You will have to stick to the bike, even swimming is sore, aqua jogging is good, as you are running in water without impact. They sell belts on line.  <br>  <br>  When you get back to running it will take time, so dont rush and also start doing core work when you are fit again it will help.<br>  <br>  Also start taking calcium tablets asap.  A Scan at the hospital may not show a stress fracture the first two weeks,  so get yourself to a good physio.  Take care, any questions pease dont hesitate.|`|WFcpHyP8aa	You are going to need to find a podiatrist and have them take a look at your foot, including xrays.

rFKHGR6oaa	 More Often then not it is called Tiger Woods Score|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Well the winning score is the lowest shots recorded and varified on a score card.  Par is usually 72 (depends on the type of course).  However anything par or lower 72 or under is what you call "scratch" which is a player with a zero handicap.  I.E. a player who consistently plays at 10 over par is a 10 handicap.  If that player is up against a scratch golfer they woudl be given 10 strokes on the game.  If the scratch golfer shoots a 73 and the 10 handicap shoots an 80 the person with the 10 handicap wins the round. <br>  <br>  The winning score though in pro golf is called "the winner."  Or to most people the winner is called Tiger Woods.|`|d0PFbP3Taa	First place winner. The score without handicap  is called  " gross ". This is a complete misnomer because there is nothing " gross" about the winning score.|`|g288r5Mgaa	Among the many reasons I love the U.S. Open is that the score of par takes on renewed significance. Any score in the red numbers typically is in contention, and rarely will anyone get close to the double-digit under par scores which are so commonplace for nearly every other tour event. Perhaps because I like seeing pros make bogeys or because a different scoring reality changes the players likely to succeed, I am always glad when even par can put a player in contention for a title. <br>  <br>  But can there be too much of a good thing? Here's an article about the course hosting the PGA this year, with predictions that the winning score may be double-digits OVER par. I seriously doubt that will happen, but I'd kind of like to see it (if only for the reactions generated). <br>  <br>  This all leads to the central question: What "should" be the winning score relative to par for a great pro event?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.discount4dvd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discount4dvd.com/</a>|`|3kwC67H0aa	There is not a special cute little name for this the way there is for one under par (birdie) etc..

The lowest score for the stipulated round wins.|`|fRyqIjN4aa	This year might be a bit of an exception, reading today's features on the course - seems several of the players are suggesting it actually played harder during their earlier practice/familiarization rounds than it has this week, and that they thought the rough had been considerably cut down since they were last there.<br>  <br>  From an AP story today:<br>  <br>  "Perhaps the biggest disappointment was seeing rough actually shorter than when he [Mickelson] got hurt. Woods and Ogilvy noticed the same thing. Ogilvy was reported to have shot 85 last week while losing seven balls, but the Australian set the record straight.<br>  <br>  "I think I shot 83 and lost two," Ogilvy said. "But it was hard. It was five shots harder last Monday than it is right now. I didn't think there would be one score in the 60s at all, and I thought there would be scores in the 90s the way we played it last Monday. But the last couple of days, it's been a lot more playable than that."|`|tM1OupHnaa	Whenever someone wins a tournament or all the bets in a game and has a high handicap, he is called a sandbagger.  |`|UZKap2TEaa	I'm pretty sure it's just "the winning score".

dI6jfLM9aa	you don't always need to have your horses registered to be able to show her.. good luck :)|`|lTeXIjpOaa	yeah, there are many shows were your horse doenst have to be registered, does your horse have a tattoo or freezebrand, if so you may be able to contact the breed association and tell them your circumstances, they may be able to help you with papers|`|RyZHhI6aaa	First of all, for a lot of shows, your horse doesn't need to be registered with a specific breed.  So check if the show you want to go to requires registration papers or not.<br>  <br>  Second, what breed is your horse?  Thoroughbreds only need to be registered to race.  Registration papers are suggested for owning a thoroughbred, but they're not required.  For quarter horses or paints, you can contact your breed registration people and they can look up your horse to see if it was really registered or not.  If she was and her paperwork was merely lost, then you can do paperwork and pay a fee to get them to send you new papers.  If she was not registered and you have the information, you can register her yourself, but for a fee.  If you can't get all of the required information, then you can't show at a quarter horse show or a paint show... just show at a neighborhood show.
Hkb7xoaQaa	Definetly doing them separately. When you do hand cleans or power cleans you want to focus as much as possible on you hips and overall leg drive and jerking after wards only forces more pressure on your back and shoulders. The jerk is really unneccesary when it comes to being more explosive, it won't do anything but tire you  our and make you use your upper body to move the weight. Stick to power cleans, dead lifts and squats, this is where you power and explosion comes from, focus on how you use your legs and hips to move the weight and if you can work in some plyometrics after the work outs, it would help.|`|AA11110524	you get your explosiveness from doing practice drills bench-press, squats, dead-lifts, and hang cleans with no jerk at all. youre not a chineses olympic power lifter you dont have to press it over your head.|`|b5ee8c09e3810b58aedf226def571615aa	try doing it separately so then you dont get yourself tired and you can keep doing a pretty decent weight instead of going heavy but being tired and doing half a rep each time

fDkAy9Ieaa	Hey, i go to workout/conditioning sessions 4 days a week for my fball team, so, u need to do benching, squatting, cleans, and dead lifts.  Those are the 4 most important lifts u can do, also, squatting is the most important of the 4.  But if u use wrong technique on these they will not help u.  Try to find ur max on all of those.  Then lift less, but in repetitions, this will gradually build ur strenghth, endurance, and max.  Also, do some curls, leg curls, and leg extensions to help, and calf raises r also very good.  Make sure u dont do the same thing 2 days in a row, that muscle needs to heal and get stronger by resting.  If u do this im positive u'll see improvements in just a couple weeks.|`|Kv4r3AHoaa	Explosive full body workouts will be the best. Such as powercleans, clean and jerks, hang cleans.

8b4980b396e6b78a3edcde8abe20cc24aa	Loris_Bxl a bien répondu, il y a 42 matches, de quoi compenser 17 points de retard.<br>  <br>  17 points: c'est 5 victoires et 2 nuls contre 7 défaites... <br>  Il suffit qu'un des clubs leader perde 7 fois pour que son avance soit comblée.<br>  Déja, avec les 2 confrontations, il y a possibilité de 2 défaites. Ce qui ne fait plus que 3 victoires et 2 nuls à obtenir pour la Juve pendant que le concurrent obtient 5 défaites...<br>  Et en plus, 2 matches nuls sur 5, c'est largement jouable.<br>  <br>  De plus, il s'agit pas d'être champion, mais de remonter !<br>  Donc d'être dans les 3 premiers !<br>  2 clubs mieux classés n'empecheront pas la Juve de monter en serie A.<br>  De ce fait, la loi des 5 victoires et 2 nuls, dont peut etre 2 victoires en confrontation directe, peut ne pas être "respectée" par 2 clubs, il suffit juste que ?a s'applique aux 19 autres.<br>  C'est largement jouable, compte tenu du potentiel de la Juventus par rapport aux concurrents de serie B !<br>  <br>  D'ailleurs, c'est pas si extraordinaire !<br>  En 38 matches, meme avec 17 points de pénalité, l'Olympique Lyonnais aurait quand même été qualifié pour la C1 en 2005 (finissant 3e), et en 2006 (finissant 2e) !<br>  Et la Juve a 42 matches, pas 38 !<br>  <br>  C'est aussi simple que ?a à comprendre.

Malgré un premier match nul à Rimini, la Juve a aligné quatre victoires et semble atteindre sa vitesse de croisière.<br>  Il y a un élément qui joue en sa faveur: c'est le nombre de matches. En effet, il y a 22 équipes en série B, donc 42 rencontres ce qui assure davantage d'opportunités de remonter ce fameux handicap de 17 points.<br>  Non seulement la Juventus va remonter en série A mais en plus, elle sera Championne.|`|4c0e60f4ee0d45b018a39c70731c8c90aa	Salut a tous et a toi aussi mon frere.<br>  Oh que si j'ai foi qu'ils reviendront en premiere division.

Per i centrali è un discorso un pò diverso perchè non dipende moltissimo da loro ma soprattutto dalla ricezione dei propri compagni, comunque ho visto dei centrali che hanno sfoderato delle ottime prestazioni mettendo a segno più di 15 punti, molti per un centrale. Per il libero diciamo che i punti sono una rarità mentre per il palleggiatore arrivano al massimo a 5 o sei punti in una partita almeno che non siano dei "mostri" a muri e in battuta. Ciao
Wl0UXtWPaa	Because nobody wants their teams to get dominated like they did before when the rams get back to their true form,because they know what happens when our offense clicks like it used to, the rebuilding is done, we're back. Superbowl Champions: St. Louis Rams|`|73005772047668391bb3ee6a5ceba354aa	I love the offense, but the defense is horrible.  I don't hate (or talk trash) about the Rams.  Steven Jackson took me into the playoffs in fantasy and followed them a lot last year.  But I just don't see them winning the division.  I don't see Bruce, Bennent and McMichael as that big of impact players (kind of like Lloyd and Randle El in Washington).  Jackson and Holt will have another big year, but I don't see them improving on what they did last year.  They didn't pick any defense up in free agency and Carriker is only one guy.  Carriker should have been one of many pieces not the only one.  Plus they over spent.  $41 million for Bennett and McMichael...way to much.  That money could have gone towards a Strahan or S. Rice (not to mention a Clement, A. Thomas, or D. Edwards).  Then you don't even go defense with your second pick (Leonard).  Yeah, Leonard is good, but the defense needs more guys (Witherspoon and Little are the only real weapons).<br>  <br>  I also think the divison is improving.  The 49ers will probably make the playoffs (they did improve the defense) and the Seahawks seem ready to compete too (The Cards are another year or two away...I think).  I just don't see the Rams stopping Gore and Alexander, but I can see Jackson being somewhat contained by the 49ers and Seattle.  I hope I'm wrong for the Rams sake, but I'm not wrong about the Rams defense and spending habits.|`|3N3g0atlaa	Colts are an exception. Think about it. The 2nd best reciever ever, one of the greatest QB's ever, Great RB in Addai who was splitting with Rhodes.<br>  <br>  Bears got to the superbowl. come on Rex Jokeman didnt do it. They won the cardinals game  with no offesive TD's|`|k2Eso8XDaa	Simply because they never live up to the hype people use to place on them. In 2003, they went 12-4 but were one-and-done with a playoff loss to Carolina. In 2004, they barely made the playoffs at 8-8 and were fortunate enough to win on a Bobby Engram dropped pass against the Seahawks, but were blown out 47-17 by the Falcons. In 2005 they went 6-10. And last year only going 8-8. All of these years they had a great offense, OK defense, but never performed to the expectations people use to place on them. <br>  <br>  Personally I feel they have a shot to win the NFC West because ts so unpredictable. They have one of the best backs in Steven Jackson who has replaced Marshall Faulk very nicely. Marc Bugler is a top 10 QB in the league and with a great receiving cast all the time, it should produce points again. As long as the defense doesn't completely implode like it did after they started 4-1, they should win between 8-10 games depending on strength of schedule and how many wins they can get in the division.|`|M3qfpu9Saa	I like the Rams, they're not my favorite team in the whole league but they're my favorite team in their division. I'm a big fan of Marc Bulger mostly cause I've always been a huge WVU fanatic.|`|ZGZyFjewaa	I don't! You guys have the most dangerous offense in the league.

nKRpwOc1aa	YA TE EXPLIKE PU.TO GRINGO DE MIERDA, QUE SOLAMENTE TUVIERON SUERTE.... TE VUELVO A CONTAR LA HISTORIA DE LAS BATALLAS QUE LES DIERON EL TRIUNFO?????<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Oh, de veras??? Fijate que no sabia, la historia que yo habia escuchado es muy muy diferente… a ver, vamos a reordar las batallas que les dieron esas tierras a EEUU ?te parece?<br>  <br>  Bueno, vamos a recordar la batalla de San Jacinto, La Angostura, la toma de Puebla y la caida de la Ciudad de Mexico, ?si?<br>  <br>  Muy bien, primero la de San Jacinto…<br>  <br>  El general y presidente Antonio Lopez Santa Anna marcho al norte pare someter a la rebelión tejana. Su primera parada fue en “El Alamo”… donde las fuerzas armadas mexicanas derrotaron y asesinaron a todos los defensores de El Alamo, (que por cierto se defendieron como nenas), después otra batalla ganada por Mexico (el Goliat) Santa Anna dividio a sus fuerzas, (pesimo error) y mando a unos por un lado y a otros por el otro, había recibido informes de que el enemigo estaba al norte, asi que estupi.damente marcho al norte a capturar al enemigo… cuentan que se encontro a una mujer muy atractiva, una tal Emily no se que, tantas tenia de cog.ersela que mando que sus tropas (aprox 1300 si mas no recuerdo) acamparan a las orillas de un rio, (otro pesimo error por que las tropas “tejanas” (en realidad eran norteamericanas) acampaban al otro lado de la colina y si nos atacaban quedaríamos atrapados entre las balas y las aguas del río…<br>  <br>  Santa se co.gio toda la noche a esa Emily, hasta que por la ma?ana escucho como los norteamericanos nos atacaban, los soldados mexicanos, aunque eran mas, (los norteamericanos eran según recuerdo aprox 900) estaban desarmados y no estaban en condiciones de pelear… Como era logico, esa fue una aplastante derrota para las armas nacionales, Santa Anna (el muy mari.ca) huyo como pudo en busca de su general Filistoa que tenia a su mando a varios miles de soldados… hasta que finalmente fue encontrado por un grupo de soldados gringos y llevado a donde Sam Huston estaba… ahí Sam Huston le pidio a Santa Anna que mandara una carta al general mexicano mas cercano a su posición, en la que le dijera que regresara al otro lado del rio bravo… de lo contrario, Santa Anna seria asesinado en venganza por las matanzas de el Alamo y el Goliat… Santa Anna (a la fuerza y gaymente) mando esa carta a su general, y el I.M.B.E.C.I.L del general obedecio las ordenes, aun sabiendo que como Santa Anna estaba prisionero esas ordenes no eran viables…<br>  <br>  ?Qué hubiera pasado si ese general hubiera exigido la liberación de Santa Anna a cambio de las vidas de los norteamericanos (recuerda que los gringos eran 900 y las tropas de ese general eran mas de 3,000)?<br>  <br>  México no solo hubiera retenido Texas, tambien hubiera podido invadir, con un éxito casi seguro a tu P.U.T.O país EEUU<br>  <br>  ?Por qué el general se regreso al otro lado del bravo?<br>  <br>  Lo mas probable es que haya estado sobornado por el clero católico, esto es muy probable, diria que esta fue la causa, pues en al mismo tiempo en Mexico, Valentín Gomez Farias intentaba quitarles sus fueros especiales y bienes a la iglesia catolica… por lo que el clero catolico busco, que a como diera lugar, el gobierno de Valentin y de Santa Anna (Valentin era el vicepreciente, pero hacia todo el trabajo de Santa Anna) Nunca se fortaleciera, para asi evitar que sus bienes fueran expropiados… cosa que el clero logro hasta que llego Juarez y les metió un palo por el cu.lo. Cabe mencionar que el clero recibia mas ingresos que el mismo gobierno y cobraba hasta por perdonar los pecados.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EN DONDE ESTA LA SUPERIORIDAD NORTEAMERICANA??????<br>  <br>  Cuando los mexicanos pelearon sin traiciones ni enga?os, como en El Alamo y en el Goliat, el resultado fue una terrible matanza de yankees, en San Jacinto ganaron gracias a la iglesia catolica, que hizo que miles de mexicanos se retiraran de Tejas en lugar de iniciar una invasión a EEUU… ?Dónde quedo la superioridad gringa que no la veo?<br>  Le debes el éxito a Santa Anna y a la Iglesia Catolica Apostolica y Romana, CUAL PI.NCHE SUPERIORIDAD SI LOS MEXICANOS HASTA PUDIMOS INVADIR SU PAIS???????<br>  <br>  Superioridad hubiera sido que nos vencieran en el Alamo y en Goliat… no que atacaran a un campamento mexicano al amanecer y tuvieran la suerte de que en Mexico la iglesia y el Estado estaban de la gre?a.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Le seguimos con la de La Angostura?...o la toma de Puebla, Monterrey y la capital???<br>  ?sabias por ejemplo, que en la toma de la Ciudad de Mexico, el ejercito mexicano estaba masacrando, si, MASACRANDO al enemigo, hasta que Santa Anna les mando “parque” (municiones) de diferente calibre del que ocupaban los soldados en al frente de la batalla???? ?o que en la misma batalla por la Ciudad de Mexico, Santa Anna se nego a mandar a la caballeria a aplastar a los gringos cuando estaban claramente derrotados? ?o que Santa Anna no mando los refuerzos necesarios a Chapultepec, aun cuando le sobraban? <br>  <br>  A que tampoco sabias que la iglesia catolica organizo una rebelión para derrocar a Santa Anna<br>  <br>  Y me imagino que desconoces que el obispo de Puebla, convencio en las misas y en los confesionarios a los habitantes de Puebla de que se rindieran. Les decia, “!no maten a un yankee o se condenaran en las llamas del infierno!” y hasta recibio al general Scott y lo invito a dormir en su palacio<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Donde esta la superioridad yankee??? No fue simple suerte que tuvieron de que la iglesia catolica los apoyara????<br>  <br>  <br>  Sabias que en La Angostura, las tropas mexicanas mascraron a los yankees hasta que se cansaron de tanto jalarle al gatillo de sus armas, pero que Santa Anna ordeno la retirada cuando solo faltaba darles el “tiro de gracia”??????<br>  <br>  Los mexicanos los matamos como y cuando se nos pego la re pu.ta gana, los unicos que nos pudieron detener fueron otros mexicanos, Santa Anna y los padres catolicos, donde esta su p.u.t.a superioridad????<br>  <br>  <br>  A nosotros nos hacen creer que perdimos por la superioridad yankee, para que no investigemos y encontremos las traiciones de la iglesia catolica y no salga a la luz la forma en la que los EEUU consiguieron esas tierras (de lo contrario quedarian ante el mundo como unos ladrones y unos incompententes), pero hay muchos ducomentos que prueban lo que digo, el diario del mismísimo James Knox Polk (El presidente gringo en ese entonces) Cartas de clerigos, periodicos de esa epoca, cartas de personas cercanas a Santa Anna, escritos de embajadores ingleses en Mexico, uff la lista de documentos probatorios nunca termina!|`|ba32b2d0f82b1b15515b1508aaa0629baa	.<br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  LOS DESPRECIADOS POR LOS PIRATAS INGLESES,<br>  <br>  SUPERAN A SUS PADRES, EN RUINIDAD......<br>  <br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|Qj5Q7Zl2aa	Yo quiero recordar en este momento una frase de  PANCHO VILLA, cuando dijo "pobresito mexico tan lejos de dios y tan cerca de bush que digo del diablo"<br>  <br>  poreso la union latinoamericana cada dia esta mas serca, aqunque segun estadisticas USA en 40 a?os sera un pais de una mayoria latina y sobre todo desendientes de mexicanos jejejeje,, bueno asi es la vida, nunca escupas para el cielo porque te caera en la cara.|`|Otdh4dJxaa	es hora de refrescarte la memoria recientemente ya somos mas de 40 millions latinos in the states so.. figurate in a few years  how it'll be  l think we'll be more than than the double<br>  so!! as you said before you gonna stood there and do nothing  nosotros los mexicanos y cualquier otro pais latino<br>  tomaremos el mando jejej y tu vas a estar ahi para verlo<br>  asi que tienes de dos...<br>  <br>  or you accept us or  you leave us alone. tan solo somos humanos jeje|`|b03b4c76486aa45b997f77d6bf6123f9aa	NO ESTES CHINGAND0 YANKEE DE MIERD.A MEJOR VETA A VIGILAR TUS UNIVERSIDADES, NO VALLA A SER QUE MATEN A OTROS 32 WEYES, MEJOR VETE A MAMA.RLE LA VER.GA A COREA PARA QUE NO TE ROMPA TU PU.TA MADRE, MEJOR ACEPTA QUE LA ECONOMIA DE TU MALDIT0 PAIS ESTA "MOVIDA" POR MEXICANOS.<br>  por favor gringo de mierd.a acepta de una buena vez que tu PIAS es mas DESPRECIADO que ARJENTINA, o sea entre TU y ARJENTINA estan las PERSONAS MAS ODIDADAS EN EL MUNDO.<br>  <br>  y para los ARJENTINOS PENDEJ0S que andan de LAME HUEVOS:<br>  <br>   El pais mas rico, con mas biodiversidad, con mejores servicios, y mas desarrollado de latinoamerica es MEXICO<br>  de hecho la lista de paises de habla hispana es la  siguiente:<br>   <br>  1 Mexico<br>  2Argentina<br>  3Colombia<br>  4Chile<br>  5Peru<br>  6Venezuela<br>  7Puerto Rico<br>   <br>  De hecho Mexico es el unico en la lista mundial de los 20 paises con mayor Ingreso percapita, osease, los paises mas ricos del mundo, Mexico ocupa el puesto numero 13 en la lista mundial y es el unico pais de Latinoamerica en la lista junto con Brasil.<br>  Asi mismo aparece 4 veces dentro de la lista de los 20 hombres mas ricos del mundo siendo Mexico el unico pais de Latinoamerica en la lista de los 20.<br>  Mexico es el el unico pais Latino en tener tratados de libre comercio con USA Y Canada, asi como con paises asiaticos como Japon, China,Singapur, Corea del Sur, Y con toda la union Europea, asi como con MercoSur.<br>  Es la 10 potencia mundial en exportaciones Internacionales y el 4to pais del mundo mas rico en Petroleo, el 3ero en procuccion agricola, asi como el mayor exportador de plata y el 5to mas rico en oro, y los pioneros en el mundo en el acero,cemento,tequila,cerveza,telecomuni... la industria alimenticia y el turismo.<br>  Mexico es la primera potencia de America Latina y esta considerado junto con China,Brasil y Emiratos Arabes Unidos como los paises candidatos a convertirse en desarrollados dentro de los proximos 15 anos.<br>  <br>  y sinceramente, SE ME HACE QUE ERES UN SUDACA QUE COMO SABE QUE SU MEDIOCRIDAD NO COMPITE CON LA GRANDESA DE MEXICO, SE ESCUDA DETRAS DE LOS GRINGOS, QUE SI NO FUERA POR LOS MEXICANOS, NO SERIAN EL PAIS MA SPODEROSOS DEL MUNDO.

8aec78a1e0f9d08387fec442aaf92740aa	Thats a great routine. You are focussing on your weaknesses and trying to make them better.<br>  <br>  Two suggestions:<br>  <br>  Run long distance - it will  also help build speed<br>  <br>  Be a little more well-rounded - work on every single aspect of the game, not just your weaknesses<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you can improve your weaknesses, then I do believe you have a shot at making your basketball team.|`|m5aXJAtIaa	woah woah woah calm down buddy ur gonna hurt urself with all that fancy stuff. my mind blew up with ur cross over training. heres wat u do to increase ur left hand eye coordination. dribble the ball with ur left hand and have some body throw a tennis ball at u and try and catch it with ur right hand. its works well if there driblin a ball to. driblin two balls helps as well. also try and play against weaker defenders lik younger kids and only use ur left hand. i do this against my lil brother and his friends. also make sure u dribble only with ur finger tips. if ur tryin out for the team ur gonna wanna be able to take a lefty layup so work on that a bit. make sure u jump off ur right foot and pick up ur knees. as for ur jumper jus make sure u tuck ur elbow in to ur chest as much as possible to lineup ur shot. bend ur knees a lil and follow through !!!!! thats all really jus practice alot doin that. take about 50 - 100 jumpers a day. as for ur speed. suicides r good but do it with the ball. being fast wont help if u cant take the ball with u. try doin things lik high knee tucks power skips and shiftin drills with the ball. all this will help ur speed significantly. play alotta pickup games against ppl who r better than u and jus try and get better urself. and good luck kid|`|dhCsJIiUaa	your routine can only be judged with the results you are getting.  if you are shooting with good form and making shots more consistently, if you are more comfortable using your left hand, and if you are noticing improvement on your speed and agility, then you are on the right track.  as far as you making the team, i guess that depends on your skill level and that of the others trying out.  just work hard, though.  practice does make perfect(or close to perfect) and some coaches reward good work ethic.|`|5wbJS0wMaa	Maybe you should try golf.
yIQclq7Raa	MAYBE ITS REALLY CLOSE BUT HE WONT BE WINNING IT HE SUCKS HE TEAM WILL WIN IT HE'LL JUST BE THERE (IF HES LUCKY HE MIGHT PLAY FOR 10 MINS. AND MAKE ONE SHOT)|`|gmxni2YPaa	he will hoo boo hoo boo the either way <br>  <br>  hoo boo hoo boo with joy<br>  <br>  hoo boo hoo boo in defeat
ec9f57769588a5e337195176afcd54a6aa	Nope, especially now that's he's making it very clear he didn't demand a trade and isn't tying his future in LA with whether or not Jerry West returns.<br>  <br>  Plus, I doubt West would want to come in and take charge and have to deal with all the BS of running the org, especially since that's why he's leaving Memphis in the first place. Consultant, maybe, but no as a full-time GM.|`|9C6KvSAkaa	No, name one good player they could get for him<br>  There is no body who has the talent he has. The Lakers would be nothing without him.|`|8Gy9smvJaa	i wish he would be traded to the utah jazz for anyone|`|LGuNGuXjaa	No chance im just guessin but he is beeing a bit dramatic, he is just tring to scare them he won't move anywhere. It's just talk.|`|ca1ZB3ygaa	nope<br>  west is comming back<br>  and everything is going to be alright|`|yIQclq7Raa	NO WAY BUDDY|`|viLgsrp4aa	No becouse Lakers need him and there is no good trade
Txe8OwPJaa	I would ice it anyway (a couple times a day for 20 minutes or so at a time)  as a precautionary measure and just to keep inflamation down, even if it doesn't hurt you all the time.  Try throwing with the brace and see if it helps.  If it's tingling, it's probably with the muscles, ligaments, or other tissues rather than the bone itself- in that case you could have pulled or strained something and it might just need rest.  If you play for a  high school, talk to your trainer about it- they should have something to give you to wear or would know more about the injury.|`|fMGU1QKLaa	sounds like what used to  be called tennis elbow, tendinitis of some type
Fl5vbHiWaa	ill tell you what happened <br>  there are only 2 things that could have happened <br>  1 is that if you were watching closely vince mcmahon put his leg in the car then took it back out before the door was shut so obviously that was a fake leg and there was probably a rope on the door. Also the fire did not explode in the area of the limo vince mcmahon was in. And if the limo actually did explode they would have also mentioned something about the limo driver and if vince was really dead it would have been on the news by now<br>  the 2nd thing that could have happened was that all the people watching raw live at philly were just watching from the titantron and they werent there to eyewitness it. So wwe could have just prerecorded that part of the show and set it all up.<br>  And vince mcmahon dead is just a storyline because a few weeks before the explosion vince predicted a dark cloud or something<br>  <br>  hope that helps<br>  <br>  PS please choose me for your best answer|`|JyeVmDxwaa	No he isn't dead it showed on Fox 2 News at 10 someone had an interveiw with him after the explosion but WWE just won't admit to it like fatherless day on wwe.com|`|l1dQCrZNaa	He is alive!! heres the story ... Mr McMahon hired Hollywood writers and people who work with explosions, The Night before Raw is when he walked out of the building and to his limo, and worked on that scene a few times.. the limo was left in the same spot over night .. then the next night they had the explosion happen.. it took Vince 2 weeks to get the permits to destroy his own limo! EMAIL me at dbuchanan12@hotmail.com and tell me what you think|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	is this the last time your gonna ask this question?|`|wfraW7xFaa	it is real it is real it is real
313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	According to WWE.com, John Cena and Paul London are one of many people considered to be suspects in the McMahon limo explosion case. They acknowledge London smiling on Raw last week when Vince McMahon was passing them. Other people considered to be suspects at this time are Mick Foley, Lashley, Coach, Cryme Tyme and the limo driver Thomas Pagliaro.

He was a bit psycho.|`|ds3BMvK4aa	it was rey misterio just playing it ...think..think..?...?..i dont know|`|dxnjVWiNaa	I say Vince faked killing himself to see how people really felt about him if they thought he was truly dead if that isn't the case then i say Jessie (the body) Ventura, I don't remember the exact way he worded it but he said something like this, all dictators meet a violent end then Jessie went on to say he was a ex navy seal trained in demolition, like he was trying to hint about something that was going to happen.|`|lTmP6YDJaa	it was the Devil killed Vince...he wants WWE to be established and transfered in Hell...|`|AA11493291	go to vince mcmahon.wik  i for get how to spell the wik word. he is not dead he,s going to holliwood to get in to movies so they had to kill his role play the real man is not dead.

gZTmVXigaa	i think they'll try to re-sign kapono, mourning (if he decides not to retire) and eddie jones.. james posey might sign with another team.. they should pursue the trade for artest.. and if they can get their hands on either javaris crittenton, sean williams or glen davis in the draft then it would be a great addition to their team.<br>  <br>  their starting line up would be williams, wade, walker, haslem and o'neal..<br>  if they can get sacramento to part ways with artest via antoine walker then they're looking at a starting line-up of williams, wade, artest, haslem, o'neal or if they trade away j-will and haslem then they would start crittenton, wade, artest, walker, o'neal|`|ERL4Zjwwaa	shaq<br>  wade<br>  williams<br>  walker<br>  haslem<br>  theyre not gonna pull off a blockbuster signing or a trade. they may pick up some swingman, but the lineup will remain the same|`|jKi4QgAoaa	same thing: <br>  <br>  williams<br>  wade<br>  walker<br>  haslem <br>  o'neal<br>  <br>  * look for posey to sign with a new team this offseason|`|x2pDkektaa	The lineup will remain the same like the guy below me said.<br>  <br>  Nobody wants a 37 yr old (im guessing) center or antoine walker who has slowed up a bit.<br>  <br>  Or a GP who is no longer in his prime...

Johnny Lee Clary<br>  <br>  World-Wide Evangelist<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The tragic deaths of Chris Benoit and his wife Nancy and son Daniel have shocked the wrestling world. The police are calling it a double-murder-suicide, but is it really? Let’s look at some facts. It has been 10 years exactly since Nancy divorced Kevin Sullivan to marry Chris Benoit. In the 1980’s Sullivan, along with his then-wife Nancy, were running a gimmick in wrestling of how they were Satanists, and Nancy was known as “The Fallen Angel.” She later became known as “Woman.” The trouble with the Satanists gimmick was it was for real, and was not a work, or fake. In the 1990’s Kevin Sullivan was the booker for WCW, and he scripted his wife Nancy into having an affair with Chris Benoit who was a member of the Four Horsemen. This made for a good angle, except, the acting became reality as Chris and Nancy actually fell in love and Nancy divorced Sullivan to marry Benoit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Benoit left the WCW to go to work for the WWE which was then known as the WWF. It is a fact that Sullivan threatened Benoit and told him he would kill him. Yes, that was 10 years ago, but Kevin Sullivan is no dummy. He is known for being a calculating, cold-hearted individual. Today, according to a source close to me, Kevin Sullivan is a high ranking member of the Satanic Church. The police need to consider the possibility that Sullivan carried out these gruesome murders in order to have his revenge, which is what Satanists live for. He could have entered the home, with an accomplice or accomplices and held the Benoit’s at gunpoint, Sullivan could have then bound up Nancy, and made Benoit and his son watch as he strangled the life out of her. Then the next day after making Benoit and his son spend the day in agony, murdered Benoit’s little boy because of his hatred for the offspring of Benoit and Nancy. Then he could have made Benoit wait an entire day before killing him to by hanging him in the basement.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By doing this, not only would Kevin Sullivan have lived out his Satanic Church creed with his lust for revenge, but he would have destroyed Chris Benoit’s reputation which is what has happened now as the wrestling world is attacking the memory of Chris Benoit remembering him as an insane baby killer and wife killer instead of the great World Champion wrestler and friend that he was.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Satanists hate the Bible and the police have stated that a Bible was found next to the bodies of Benoit’s wife and son. This would serve as a bizarre calling card as if to either say “What good did your Bible do you?” or to throw off investigators to keep them from suspecting Sullivan and his Satanists would have been involved.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing to note is the fact that Kevin Sullivan was also associated with Sherri Martel, who died just a few days before the bodies of Chris Benoit, and his family was found, and the full details of Martell’s death have not been made known as of the time of this writing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I wonder why the police have not even considered investigating the possibility the Kevin Sullivan killed Benoit, Nancy, and their child. It is certainly a possibility worth looking in to.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Benoit was going to be crowned ECW World Champion on Sunday night. Why would he murder his family and kill himself when he was going to be on top again and make lots more money?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Why would he tie his wife up before killing her? He would have no reason to, but Kevin Sullivan sure would!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sure he had some problems with Nancy, but that was 4 years ago and what married couple doesn’t have problems? Remember also that they reconciled and as far as everyone knows there has been no other incidents reported.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One also needs to consider the fact that Benoit loved his kids and was so proud of his son that was killed. His kids wore suits and ties to his wrestling events and was proud of their dad. He was loved and respected by all those who knew him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, there is no way he would have murdered his family. This whole murder case has Satanists written all over it and Sullivan is a Satanist and has the motive to murder them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am encouraging anyone who reads this to send this to police authorities and circulate it on the internet, so these facts can be investigated, before the case is closed and Benoit is written off in history a murderer. If Sullivan is the real killer, justice should be served!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a former Pro Wrestler myself, now a born again Christian and world wide evangelist, I am hoping and praying for justice no matter who is responsible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rev.

His move set is limited not only beyond belief, but even beyond Hogan's. He moves with a speed and grace that makes Big Show look like a high flyer and a tree like a contender. And his facial expression at times simply looks like he has no clue what in blazes he is (supposed to be) doing.<br>  <br>  He really has about the same talent as many female "entertainers", which size and size alone - except that in his case, it's of the entire body, not just parts thereof.<br>  <br>  So, may he live long and prosper. Just off my television, please.|`|Mjl94Y5eaa	Its just that he is painful to watch.  He only has a few power moves and just seems to stand there.|`|iTXuN2Unaa	The Great khali has a great power in his body but only power is nothing to win but is something when you have experience of ring and all kind of matches... only a thing khali need is experience and planning after that no body is there in SmackDown RAW and ECW who can make the great khali out ... ahaan when it comes to the Undertaker .. he can do it he is the phenoum
AA10410690	I assume you're talking about trench fight. It's damn near impossible, only the fast strong defensive ends can do it consistantly. Julius Peppers etc.<br>  <br>  You need to crush the first guy, then pretty much run around the blockers the rest of the way.|`|AA10373661	no idea...:'(|`|73005772047668391bb3ee6a5ceba354aa	Practice (and repetition).  Normally you can swim by the first guy or bull rush.  Then it is possible to run by the second guy (to the right), then try to bull rush the next guy.  Bull rushing is not hard (but doesn't work every time).  I've done it by staying off of the turbo, and then right before you get to him, tap, as fast as you can, the turbo/bull rush button (depends on system).  Then do whatever it takes to finish.  Good luck.|`|8Dh9PDPVaa	OK so the two people above me aren't talking about Millsberry. lol. And Idk how people can get the trophy cause I can't get it either. All I know is: You need 1000 points to get the trophy. To score 1000 points you need to finish both levels in under 30 seconds. If u get that far, wait around 10 seconds to submit your score, some people say it helps to get trophies. It must give the computer more time to process.
07NhHUk0aa	They throw it away. The fans who get the broken bats usually sell it on eBay.  LOL. Or they ask the players to sign it or just keep it.|`|e6f92a46b35bab4190c6215347227970aa	well a guy used to make lamps out of them and he works for the Astros.  He would make a homplate foundations which had the 80's astros logo on it.  then the broken bat would be the lamp and then he put a astros helmet as a lamp shade.  He only made them for short time before the astros and mlb found out what he was doing.  My grandpa has one its a broken Jose Cruz bat and its autograph by Jose Cruz (a icon in houston) he passed away and gave it to my dad hopefully one day i can get it.  Its very cool looking we know that it works but its never ever ever turned on.|`|TbO83l3yaa	i think some of them are auctioned off, like the broken bashed guitars from bands that destroyed them. i saw some in hard rock|`|F4rdbw7kaa	usually thrown away|`|tAXdwjtDaa	The broken bats get thrown into the stands. The fans usually keep them or do whatever they want with them.
V0YY6PTPaa	Well if Mookie Wilson was still his age when he was playing in the MLB, he would probably be the fastest guy mentioned. What I think is that Mookie Wilson is the fastest, Ricky Henderson is 2nd fastest, Jose Reyes is 3rd fastest, Deangelo Hall is 4th fastest, and Carl Crawford is 5th fastest.|`|ma48sTxbaa	I don't think so. Mookie is around 40 some years old now...Henderson is also around 45 or so...The younger guys are much faster. Come on?|`|34b825defa82546f0ed991438bf0684daa	Mookie Wilson's pretty old right now...so unless he's running to the mailbox for his Social Security check, I doubt he's winning any foot-races.|`|9iG4gwBOaa	NO|`|Q83skC5Saa	I believe Wilson is  the quickest of the five mentioned.|`|bgVsMpMbaa	no.

My uncle was a minor league pitcher who ended up being a pitching coach for a minor league tem.|`|outHDUXFaa	try talking to your nearest team about it you probobly would have to start at the bottom and watch any retired player who never had a good baseball career start above you|`|u98ygMLCaa	you get signed by a team, and either demoted or promoted to aa or aaa.... the minor league team to aquire the manager have to buy the contract from the team that has him

It's worth it to me.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I watch more hockey than anything, and had a similiar issue with NHL Network ..<br>  Just goes to show networks are like companies with one thing in mind; our money.|`|ak5A435maa	i never got mlb network to begin with! and thats cheap! make you watch it and like, then make you pay up? thats stupid|`|WaaFCtuOaa	It's still free from my local comcast cable company but need to inquire how much it is though.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Still free for me, that's gotta suck for you. My cable company better not remove it or I'll...I'll..well I don't know. Guess buy it too.|`|aHqrtfhUaa	Yeah, it was a new channel and they were getting you addicted.  NFL network did the same thing when it first came on.  Its kinda like a trial period. I would pay for it.
Nuj1eScCaa	Yes, they all know that they are going to be the ones with the ball most of the time and they are going to need to expand their game to make the defense play them honest. <br>  <br>  Lebron, Wade, Durant, they were all mediocre 3 point shooters but now defenses won't know what they're going to do, shoot, drive, pass.<br>  <br>  Jason Kidd has always been decent from the perimeter but he's been even better the last few seasons. He's probably losing a staep or to in his speed and will look to shoot out there more and more as he gets older.|`|hzttr76Maa	Yeah, I noticed. All-Star players can add many more dimensions to their game easily. But some stars like Howard, Duncan, or KG, can't shoot a 3 pointer on their life.<br>  <br>  3 pointers are deadly skills to possess, and most stars need that skill in order to extend the lead or tie the game up.|`|NJtjJA8Baa	It is because they need a new weapon. Everyone expects LeBron to drive: what do you do when he shoots a 3 and gets hot? You have to guard him tight, then he can drive again. Just to give some versatility.|`|8QZDwehtaa	yeah have you seen Chris Paul play lately he's awsome at 3 pointers.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	i would say duncan and garnett are shooters and they probably could but they dont wanna take that chance howard on the other hand cant <br>  dwade isnt to good in 3s lebron 3 point stat is acually better than kobes now which is kind of good but the reason for that is in order to be mvp you gotta beat the mvp|`|HiuNSScLaa	he is waaay better wade is mvp give him his props<br>  <br>  durant is in his 2nd year <br>  <br>  and thats what happens when you practice and work hard at your goals|`|UYPfC5YVaa	They just tend to improve their shooting touch. It makes a star player even more unstoppable.|`|uxregJ0faa	thats what happens when you put in hard work and practice|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, think about it.  If you're LeBron and you know the 3 is you're main weakness, what are you going to practice?  Everyone knows LeBron is going to drive, everyone knows thats his game, and everyone knows he's awesome at it, does he really need to practice taking it to the hoop?<br>  <br>  You spend most of your shootarounds practicing the 3 and you'll get better at it.  He kinda has to do that too, because without a jumper, people will just play him to drive.  Hit a few 3s and they have to respect your jumper which totally opens up the rest of your game.
c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Generally, you'll only see that type of behavior in Philadelphia.|`|IfZz1hOgaa	Yes all Americans are sore losers because some fans from MEXICO threw stuff at the Australian players. I mean I know a lot of other countries hate us and all, but you can try a little harder than this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry I just read what you edited. No that doesnt happen in America much but I can't speak for Mexico. I was actually rooting for Australia because Mitch Dening plays for them and hes a Red Sox prospect. Sorry for the confusion.|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	I was rooting for Mexico to win that game and was pretty upset when they lost but I did not go crazy as they did. They are a proud sports fans and were obviously shocked and upset they lost because they did not expect so. Having that said they'd no right to do so and it's pretty embarassing but that's not a good reason to generalize. Good luck to Australia for the rest of the WBC and hopefully we can see a rematch.|`|utTFiz3gaa	that's horrible :(<br>  <br>  i didn't know that happened that is truly disgusting behavior i have to say. Well i think it is unfair to generalize but i agree with you in that that kind of sportsmanship is terribly cruel and poor.<br>  <br>  p.s. i love australians lol i think i am more infatuated with the accent :D|`|7d56606180147fc46163300eadf7b3b0aa	The problem is the poor improvished bloody mexicans have such a little, a loss at a game they are supposed to be one of the best at is a bit too much to take. But sorry mate we win at whatever we take an interest in!  ozzie! ozzie! ozzie!  oi! oi! oi!!!!|`|FC34jxiaaa	Wow, **** like that never happens in Europe or elsewhere. Oh, wait... yes it does.|`|GAsHsBEGaa	That type of behaviour does not happen in Europe. I'm sorry, but that doesn't happen. That was truly disguisting and rude by the Mexican crowd.|`|HxluJK2Vaa	They will probably get kidnapped now!<br>  <br>  Go the Green & Gold... can we upset the Cubans?|`|KNTofuxMaa	A little unfair to generalize, eh mate?|`|xIfvXy4waa	Don't stereotype! Hey I was rooting for your Aussies... I would never throw stuff at the players. I really have respect for all the players who go out there. If you really believe that then you have a closed mind and will be missing out on a lot my friend.

hPpWmZZPaa	I always thought the All Blacks would win but I expected it to be more convincing, Australia played well first half and I think the score was a fair reflection of how the game was played out.|`|Q46zEPrZaa	I agree entirely with Mark L above me, i couldn`t have put my thoughts better.<br>  We keep hearing that Robbie Deans is the master coach and he will eventually win against the All Blacks...<br>  If Deans was the Master Coach...he would be coaching NZ now.<br>  It`s not about coaches, it`s about the quality of players, and Aussie just doesnt have them, so until more are developed through internal competition growing .they`ll always be second to the ABs,sure they might win the odd one ,thats all.|`|7DV4YndGaa	The Kaha wasnt there tonight for the AB's, the 2nd half the AB's put what should be there 1st 15 thats when you actually see what the AB's are made of.  Dont get down though Aussie Robbie Deans is looking more into the big picture Aussie will be back and then the real games will start.|`|AA11653773	i thought the surface wrecked the whole game,Though i thought the Wallabies had it over the All Blacks at one point.It was a great game to watch besides all the whistle blowing i thought the All Blacks just had it just a tad over the Wallabies|`|AA11586164	Aussie r not the push overs some believe them to b .. .The tri-nations ,super 14 & Bledisloe were close right to the end .. Deans has instilled pride in Aussie ..not the Ego crap as b4.. REAL PRIDE & it is showing.. There was never doubt it was either sides game depending on the players.. Congrats to BOTH teams|`|zXK9hVCPaa	I cant help but agree with Mark L. Until we have a front row of international standard we are going to keep on losing. I also wonder if there is a mental thing though when it comes to the AB's? As for the refing!!|`|quuOtb1Raa	Robbie Deans as Coach for the Wallabies is going to turn the tide for Australia and the ABs are not going to have it all their own way.<br>  |`|sdlaicxeaa	Predictable but I did not expect only 4 tries for the game.|`|OcblQVlvaa	You can never predict the outcome of an AB Aussie game , the teams are so evenly matched. <br>  Being close neighbours and there love for the game only boosts there strengths and is no wonder they are the two best teams in the world.|`|kecdkv6jaa	I though the Aussies had it but the bloody All Blacks always do that to me, give me hope get me exited and then crush me. i'm sick of it!|`|YsSwe1Laaa	Yes, predictable because the WAL pack is just not up to 80 minutes of performance at the level offered by the ABs.  Deans may be a fine coach - certainly at other levels he has the record to back this up, but neither his nor anyone else's coaching can make up for a front row that does not scrummage competitively week-in and week-out.  And without a truly competitive 2nd tier competition in AUS, it is harder for them to develop first-rate forwards.  Australian union supporters need to press Mr. O'Neill to focus on the overall development of the game internally, and specifically the development programmes (especially for forwards).<br>  <br>  Mark L.|`|mber3JoAaa	It was always going to happen but calling it predictable is taking it a bit far!!<br>  <br>  How many times did referee Alan Lewis get in the way of the play tonight? I lost count in the teens. Absolutely pathetically refereed, the worst refereeing I've seen in a long time.|`|Zwu0WwEFaa	Australia started off strong, but it was always quietly predicted that the ABs would eventually take over.. was a scratchy start to the tour but a win nonetheless.. wasn't as much of a spectacle for the fans and the ground was so soft ppl were slipping over in scrumtime..<br>  but its a good stadium.. just need to fix the grounds so as to showcase running rugby|`|vXgF2fMoaa	I would of thought the aussies had the game but then the all blacks came back............as usual.<br>  Aussies played well but all blacks played smart and took every chance to win the game...<br>  3 chances for the walabys to go for penalty kicks but they didnt and thats what cost the game...i think.<br>  I guess the walabies gave it to the all blacks again????????<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|zjGRfALRaa	I was expecting more from Australia. The ABs have great form though. It will be hard to break them. Australia have to learn that great spirit and a few good plays wont get them far. the ABs are a brilliant team and it will be a long time before they go down<br>

mG2BCZe7aa	Did you know that back in the day Kareem Abdul Jabbar won the MVP even when the Lakers didn't make the play-offs? <br>  <br>  It happened in 1976 Lakers were 40-42 but Kareem posted numbers such as: 27.7 PPG, 16.9 RPG, 5 APG, 4.1 BPG and 1.5 SPG truly MVP numbers.<br>  <br>  Noting this you see how far the NBA have deviated itself from the criteria of the yesteryears to nowadays where the MVP is measured by a team's win. The MVP is supposed to mean a players value to his team. And by that measurement I think Wade definitely deserves the award this year. Remember James and Bryant both have the tools for success, Wade has not and his Heat is so reliant of him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	could still be lebron, but wade is definitely tied with lebron after the way wade has been playing....its coming down to lebron and wade, if kobe wins it......<br>  rofl a MVP candidate must win 50 games? what the **** is wrong with you<br>  mc is just a biased idiot because the lakers are getting ripped apart and wade has averaged 37 ppg the past 10 games and he has worked his heart out through every game this season and every injury. get that dildo out of your ***.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	"Well in that case, why wasn't KG ranked higher than LeBron?<br>  <br>  KG. did finish 3rd last season.

Hurts.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Since the 1980-81 season, the MVP has been determined by a panel of broadcasters and sportswriters. And since that year, it has gone to players on winning teams ONLY. I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way it is. The last player to win the MVP for a losing team was Kareem in 75-76. The Lakers were 40-42 that year, but he led the NBA in rebounding and blocked shots and minutes played, and the Lakers did NOT make the playoffs as only 8 teams made it then.<br>  <br>  And how can you say that Kobe deserved it either year that Nash won it? Get real. In 2004-05, Kobe shot a poor FG% and 3pt% and had a terrible assist-turnover ratio as he "led" the Lakers to a 34-48 record. In 2005-06, he shot more but still had a poor FG% and 3pt% and had an even worse assist-turnover ratio as he took the Lakers to a 45-37 record. Other than raw points, how is either season MVP-worthy, when Nash led the Suns to 62 and 54 wins (and they were arguably one cheap shot from the Finals)?<br>  <br>  And don't give me the "play their hearts out" angle. There are MANY players who give 100% every game and haven't won an MVP. KG is a prime example. The guy doesn't float for one minute when he's on the floor; he hasn't for years.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	no think of the Cavs without Lebron , we would be maybe .500 or maybe less they wouldn't be all that bad they would be like 6 losses more then they have i hate to disagree with u but u are not being loyal to your team|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dwyane Wade is most definitely the "MVP"!|`|3teWTOPqaa	Did any of those guys win 50 games in the year they were "robbed"?? Just accept the rule that a MVP must win 50 games, if they give it to Wade this year then they have to admit those guys got "robbed". Award them on a consistent basis please.<br>  <br>  Calm down dawg!<br>  <br>  EDIT: So records doesn't matter? Keep telling yourself that sweetheart, but you already listed 3 times you were proven wrong. I don't have a problem with Wade winning it, but in the past putting up stats doesn't do **** if you don't have the record to back them up.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also ask yourself this, are the Heat contenders? Cuz the past 15 MVPs were given teams that have a good shot at winning the title.<br>  <br>  EDIT: K.G's stats wasn't as strong, and remember LeBron was only 3rd on the ballot, which is probably where Wade is going to end up if his team doesn't pull up a huge winning streak.
GswnLKtQaa	48 points, 12 assist, 3 blocks, 4 steals, 6 rebounds, game winning shot at the buzzer. MVP!<br>  <br>  amazing game by Wade, MVP indeed!|`|3teWTOPqaa	No last year Kobe should have won it and he did. This year Wade still won't win this, I don't like but it's pretty much an unspoken rule that a MVP must win 50 games now days. It's like what Shaq said "I am cool with it as long as the refs are consistent", so if all those guys got "robbed", then Wade will get "robbed" this year too.<br>  <br>  Calm yourself down dawg!|`|WCHeU1Zlaa	I'm speechless that was one of the greatest plays I've ever seen!!!

KkZE2NDYaa	The first one gives dimensions and 10 by 18 should be plenty of room for your mattress. They are both decent tents but not top of the line. Coleman products have always been reputable. It is also plenty large for a mattress. One is square and one is more rectangular, so that might be the biggest thing to consider for sleeping arrangements.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	Both tents have pluses and minuses, I have an older model square Colman dome tent 12x12 with out the wing design and it is still holding up 5 years later it has been the best tent I have ever owned in keeping me dry in heavy rains in Big bear lake ca. and holding up in the nasty winds out in Joshua tree NP. I think the wings will allow wind and rain to become a problem. The same with the wenzel it has too steep of sides and no coverage of rain fly over the windows.

73c54edf17bc6e46f1b58fc8f251941faa	Wade is definitely the #1, MVP, player, no doubt. That shot....amazing just happened. If the heat didn't have Wade, they wouldn't survive this year. Wade for MVP!|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Sorry, you're dreaming if you think Wade has a shot at the MVP this year.  If he keeps putting up 40+ points a game then maybe, but he's not going to do that.  He's going to fall back to his season/career averages.  Right now LeBron is leading Wade in virtually every statistical category.  And the Cavs are leading the East, while the Heat are just a few games above 500.  Check the list of previous MVP winners, you'll see they *always* come from one of the two or three best teams that season.<br>  <br>  I'd love to see Wade win it, though.  I like the way he plays, and I'd love to have something derail the LeBron bandwagon, even if it's only for a season.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	i swear every thing with d-wade that ***** jimmy hated but when you find a way to get back at him he pussy up <br>  D-WADE IS SO UNDERRATED lebron overrated and kobe is just trip i thing he should retire befor he mess around and bring his career stats down but other than that DWAYNE WADE FOR MVP and jimmy everybody stuggle against weak teams<br>  you say mia heat is weak but they beat cavs this year already <br>  so tell me when you decide to grow balls and getback at me|`|Nuj1eScCaa	I didn't see it unfortunately.

Dwyane Wade = MVP!!!|`|wGO7thhwaa	i understand where your coming from, and props to wade tonight.<br>  hes the best player in the NBA this year.<br>  but the only thing holding him back is the playoff seeding.<br>  lebron/kobe's team are 1 seeds.<br>  the heat are the 5th seed i think.<br>  he should be in serious serious consideration though|`|xtuyRToAaa	Did you see the game today?<br>  D-Wade just willed his subpar team to win as he's done all season.<br>  And with astronomical numbers in points, assists, blocks and steals, he should be the MVP hands down.<br>  <br>  LeBron comes in second. Kobe should not even be mentioned along this two.|`|gprdq8E2aa	I agree he should atleast be 2nd in the MVP race this week, if not 1st, he is the best of the best. Best on the planet NO.3 D WADE!|`|GswnLKtQaa	D-Wade has been playing great since the all-star game, He's producing great numbers and Heat has been on a roll lately, Flash really has a legit chance of winning the MVP award this season, he is amazing.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	I'm sick of people saying he's been playng great since the "all-star break". He's been playing great ALL SEASON LONG by leading the league in scoring for most of the season....|`|FUoKu13Daa	I would not go that far because I still think over the course of the entire season I think LBJ is the MVP but Wade has been playing incredible since the all star break.<br>  <br>  I just don't think he is playing at a level were you ignore two players that are playing incredible themself but their team is much better.<br>  <br>  If you did not take into account team performance then I would say without a doubt that Wade is MVP. But throughout the history of the league team record is a factor in the people who vote for the award.  <br>  <br>  Michael Jordan would have about 10 MVPs if they did not take into account team record and last year Lebron stats were amazing and would have easily have won the award if they did not take into account team record,<br>  <br>  But I would put LBJ as 1 and Wade as 2 in my mvp voting right now.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	nah, don't get lebron out of the picture yet. what if wade suddenly completely busts? but i think and i hope he doesnt, if lebron or wade dont win MVP this year, if its another kobe unworthy ****, then the nba is seriously biased.<br>  <br>  what the **** are you talking about, jimmy boy? eat ****, dwyane wade is a beast, he got 35 against phoenix, 41 and then 25 against the cavs, 50 against orlando, not only scoring but dishing assists and getting rebounds as well. same could be said about kobe and lebron getting high scoring games against weak teams (knicks). get off my nuts.<br>  and did you NOT see him after the game? HE WAS ******* EXCITED he PUMPED up the roaring crowd and came along the MVP chants. EVERYONE ISNT CLUTCH, even kobe and lebron miss shots. when you grow some balls, talk back.|`|gMTatFZBaa	Um, there is a debate.<br>  <br>  His name is LeBron.<br>  <br>  He should have won it last year, he should win it this year.<br>  <br>  End of story.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You Wade jockers are comical.  You look at one thing, and one thing only, how many points he scores, the rest of the picture doesn't matter.  Why do I think tonight's performance wasn't all that?  Here's why.<br>  <br>  1) He played Chicago.  They're not the Golden State Warriors, but they're a bad team, in the bottom 10 in team defense, and beating them isn't much to brag about.  Especially when you need 2 OTs to do it.<br>  <br>  2) You all say Wade is super clutch.  What did he do in the first OT.  He didn't score at all, is that something your star does in OT?  Also, when stars are fouled with 17 seconds left, with a chance to ice the game, they don't miss both FTs and let the other team tie the game and send it to a 2nd OT.  Jordan wouldn't have choked like that.  LeBron or Kobe wouldn't have choked.  <br>  <br>  3) Then Mr Choke has a chance to win it again at the end of the first OT, and he chokes again.  Is this really MVP play?<br>  <br>  I'll give him the fact that he made a nice steal and hit the 3 to win it and the 3 to tie it in the 4th, but how many chances did he have to win the game?  Give a guy that many tries, he'll eventually make one.  <br>  <br>  When Wade plays well against quality opponents, when he's not struggling to beat teams like Chicago, when he's not getting himself T'd up and tossed when he plays good competition, maybe I'll give him more MVP consideration.  When he's actually clutch when the team needs him, instead of missing a pair at the FT line, maybe he'll get more consideration.  For now, hes a player who's more concerned with his own point totals than he is with winning games.

MC2L5nRAaa	This class will be up there on the list of the greatest classes. Strahan and Sapp two of the greatest pass rushers to ever play, with Sapp playing tackle he still had almost 100 sacks, and Strahan had 144.5 which is just incredible. Brett Favre one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play, most TDs and plenty other records. Ogden one of the best tackles ive ever seen 11 probowls in 12 years and a SB ring. Bill Parcells a great coach 2 rings, and I think there are some more including Junior Seau, a great line backer, its gonna be a great class, I dont know if seven places is enough.|`|OpOqqlGXaa	There is a chance of it...<br>  <br>  <br>  best answer please!!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZh5oZ8Dqsg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZh5oZ8Dq...</a>|`|f1bDqCpEaa	Hmmm, It'll for sure be one of the better ones<br>  <br>  2000 (Long, Lott, Rooney, Montana, Wilcox)<br>  1979 (Butkus, Unitas, Mix, Lary)<br>  1989 (Blount, Bradshaw, Shell, Wood)<br>  1993 (Walsh, Noll, Fouts, Little, Payton)<br>  <br>  I probably put it 3rd amonst this above group which I list in order|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	Nope. 1990, 1994, 1999, 2000 were all better classes.

Fn7cOOWaaa	Miller Park –unlike Bush –?is a little isolated, so when you go there... you're there. But that just means you need to adjust your perspective. And follow the millions that have come before and experience "tailgating". It's pretty awesome to hang in the parking lot with lawn chairs unfolded, Weber grill fired up and your favorite meats getting flame broiledand a cooler of your favorite beverages). If you can swing it, it's a great prpregamectivity. Sausages inside the stadium are rocking as well... Italian, Polish, brat... you can't go wrong. <br>  <br>  Busch is more walkable and neneighborhoodn Downtown St. Louis. Plenty of hotels very close by.  Al Hrabosky’s Ballpark Saloon is the proverbial down and dirty hangout. If you like Cajun - Broadway Oyster Bar has great food, drinks and a lot of personality. J Bucks is very popular. The "Outfield" at Mike Shannons is just a huge beer garden on game days. And there's good music in the area... and of course, the Arch... worth a visit. Unfortunately, the Cardinals Museum closed this year... and it won't re-open until ballpark village opens... some day. <br>  <br>  Anyway... you can check out some of the bars, hotels, and restaurants that are close by on our site Out of the Ballpark... there's a nice map... just click on St.Louis: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.outoftheballpark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.outoftheballpark.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|yererDcnaa	if youre a baseball fan, then id advise you to actually go see a game. <br>  <br>  try sliding down the slide at the brewers ball park. at the cardinals busch stadium you gotta try the BBQ pork sandwich. one of my favorite foods at any ball park.<br>  <br>  i always like to grab garlic fries at any ball park i go to and see which one is the best. so far, id have to say my favorite garlic fries are at at&t park (sf giants).|`|fDHOKkjdaa	If you'd go at NY or Boston, putting th other team's colors...

drhWMyoWaa	Thats not a bad idea at all if they could do it. If they could swing an actual "Competition" between the NFL and the UFL it would be like bringing back the AFL and the NFL. If u see wha im saying. My point is this, money not love motivates this game. So if u get enough players that want money, and the UFL has enough to throw at high name players well my friend u could start you your own team. How much are we talkin tho? At least in the Billions. And then u would be doomed if the UFL caved because it wasnt one of the tradional things in sports. But this organization if they had enough money could compete with the NFL. Lets say players that didn't make training camps or even draft picks that want more money opt to go to the UFL thats a competition in itself. Wow, thas a crazy concept that u jus threw out there|`|KNTofuxMaa	They tried that in the 80's with the USFL. Many Fture NFL players started there. Herschel Walker being 1 of them. It didn't last long and I don't think this League will, either. The NFL is king.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	It's been tried by various leagues in the past.  The effects of the UFL on the NFL will be minimum.  The UFL will probably effect the Canadian league much more since they seem to rely on NFL rejects just as the UFL will.
Hki3AoL5aa	1) Nicklas Backstrom (the capital) because I am the best passer and play maker on the team and in our 12 league games I had 9 assists and 2 goals very nick backstrom like numbers. I play wing on our top line and most of my helpers have gone to our leading goal scorer who finished with 25 goals.<br>  2) Same guy Backstrom, dont get me wrong If i have the clear shot ill take it but my strength is passing and thats where I excel.|`|3buQDaRDaa	1) Chris Pronger. I was tall and skinny. I was physical and on the border of being dirty. I was a good passer, had good vision, and an above average shot. <br>  <br>  2) I was happy with who I was like.|`|hFX5UQGdaa	Rick Dipietro<br>  Planning to be a NHL goaltender when I get older|`|DCNL73ZJaa	flurey we both do the same stuff like same style everything<br>  <br>  i want to be like martin b he is so cool and good|`|3Bw4e9Bvaa	1) the dominator....i am a goalie and as the goalie my job is to do whatever it takes to stop the puck, im so sick of these butterfly all the time goalies getting lit up top shelf because they go down every time. sometimes i watch the game and it shocks me to see ovie walk in and the goalie drop before he shoots and PING snipe...guys the best shooter in the game dont help him by dropping to you knees. Dominator was a blast to watch and always did whatever he could to stop it.<br>  <br>  2) Patrick Roy even though i hate butterfly all the time goalies, he is the single greatest clutch goalie of all time in my opinion, whenever the game is on the line the pressure is all on the goalie to come out and stand on his head and Roy did it time and time again without him the Av's would have just been a mediocore team.|`|AA11674745	1) Bernie Parent, because I tried to emulate him as best I could.<br>  <br>  2) If I were still playing, Bernie Parent.|`|RplkclzJaa	Nick Lindstrom for both, I can't remember the last time I didn't lead my team in plus/minus.|`|nu0kSDqWaa	I played forward for 2 years and goalie for a year.<br>  <br>  1. forward-Ron Francis. I got more assists than goals. Goalie-Hasek. My coach (former scout in Montreal) gave me the nickname The Dominator because I could get down easy like he could.<br>  <br>  2. forward-I really don't know. I would have to think about it. Goalie-never playing again.|`|axxQzOCHaa	(1) Jere Lehtinen .. like him, I am a pretty good skater, which allows me to follow the play in all zones. My shot is good enough to help offencively and I pass the puck well.<br>  <br>  (2) If you saw my junior year (high school) picture you would think I looked like Lafleur on his 73 - 74 O-Pee-Chee card.

a85f7296bd89d164e65c09b343ee8a83aa	whoa whoa whoa. Kobe is better than Wade anyday. Kobe is better than Lebron too. Plus you can't compare Kobe with Lebron or Wade. Kobe was in a different time era. Yes, a different time era. Just like how you can't compare MJ and Dr. J and Kobe and MJ, you can't compare Kobe to Lebron or Wade. You can compare Kobe to Iverson or some other older guys.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Because he has the highest PER rating on ESPN.  After him, CP3.|`|KOfwamdbaa	They don't brainwash anyone its called an opinion. With all respect to Dwayne LeBron is better.|`|njlBV9Enaa	I agree wit u 100%!! especially with all the comercials that lbj does kids think hes da bes.t All he cares bout is money!|`|lfcPEscbaa	lebrons teammates are scoring in the fourth because lebron doesnt play in the fourth because they are winning by so much entering the fourth<br>  lebron could play any position, d - wade just pg or sg<br>  lebron = more clutch 48 pts in a playoff game against pistons to win<br>  the media is right, your wrong|`|TCO2VfXRaa	its cause his numbers. just like why tim tebow didnt win the heisman. if u wanna put i definition to "valuable" for the NBA awards purposes then ppl can actually argue about it but until then its basically gonna b a popularity/stat sheet contest|`|3xdBdGmtaa	No I would never expect any bias from a guy calling himself Wade's #1 Fan!!|`|JdzgKm1oaa	king james|`|bgyMsoe5aa	Tracy is the real MVP|`|33cnTn1Laa	is the Great Yao Gay ???|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Excuse me Shawn Marion has established himself as one of the best all-around talents in the NBA for years now and Michael Beasley is a ROY Candidat and Udonis Haslem is a double double threat w/ a good midrange game. Never say Wade has nothing. LBJ23 is the best alla-round player in the game and this year his team has taken great leaps mostly because of Mo Williams signing, but LBJ23 has had dreadful rosters in the past in Cleveland and made them go to the Finals. He never had a Shaq, Jason Williams running the point, a HOF player in GP and Zo who still contributed well and a All-star in Walker who gave the team 10+.|`|csKyqot0aa	If Wade was more valuable than LeBron then why does Cleveland have a much better record? <br>  <br>  The Celtics and Cleveland both have a way  better record than Miami.
LazsFrxhaa	Steve Nash hopefully, he should have won last year considering that kobe somehow managed to win. and I say Garnett is way better than Pierce|`|L70WP8Xeaa	if the lakers get 62 wins and above and Kobe's stats around 26 pts 5 rebs 5 assts he would get the MVP.<br>  <br>  if Hornets would win more than 58 games and CP3 stats around 21pts 11 assts 2.5 stls. he may have a chance<br>  <br>  if Cavaliers win 55 or more and james stats 28pts 7 rebs 7 asst it would go on his way. <br>  <br>  if those 3 players get all those stats above, Kobe would still beat them.|`|YbhsP1fxaa	MVP 2009 = Kobe Bryant<br>  <br>  Teehehehehehe..:P<br>  <br>  :P<br>  <br>  <3<3<3<br>  <br>  :-P|`|nXoaK2XTaa	Neither.|`|JmYJJqJTaa	KB|`|4QAl8uidaa	Kobe will be but if i had to KG|`|3teWTOPqaa	no it's Kobe Bryant or Chris Paul|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I don't think any Celtic will win it, and it isn't just because I hate them ;)<br>  <br>  In all seriousness, with Garnett, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce, Boston made it pretty much impossible for one to be MVP.  They win because all three are good, not because one guy wills his way for the team to win. (ex: LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul)<br>  <br>  I think LeBron wins it this year just because the media doesn't want to wait another year to pick him.  Kobe finally got his, now it is LeBron's turn.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Out of those two, I think Pierce would get it over KG. because he shoots more, which means more ppg for him. <br>  <br>  Usually players who get chosen the MVP score alot of ppg. 21-35 ppg. <br>  <br>  exception: Steve Nash back to back|`|mff1vstNaa	I don't think either of them have a chance. They both don't play individually and KG was in the race last season because the voters considered his impact on the Cletics, not his play.|`|KkOJD0Cxaa	None Kobe will repeat|`|IAnT8aGsaa	What about Chris Paul?
C7YbYUYPaa	Denver just made their team legit.<br>  <br>  A.I. and Carmelo obviously didn't work together.  Sure they scored a ton of points, but two scorers who don't play defense didn't make a right.  Too much ego for one team.<br>  <br>  By getting rid of Iverson, Denver adds Chauncey Billups, who is a much better on the ball defender than Iverson, and a good compliment to Anthony.  Rumor is that McDyess will be bought out, and probably will resign with Detroit, so that really doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  I think Detroit really screwed up, because no two guys in the NBA had better chemistry than Billups/Hamilton.  The Pistons (aside from Sheed) are a very team oriented group, and really never had any big drama, high profile superstars.  They played well as a unit, and Iverson will try and steal the show.  It will be like Iverson's 76ers days.|`|jjjgcuduaa	Detroit no doubt, they get a great player who can score and pass in Iverson.. Not to mention Dumars is preparing to give it a shot at getting the 2010 free agents which includes LeBron, Carmelo, Bosh, etc.. Let's not forget Kobe is also a free agent in 2010.|`|4BwasmTSaa	Billups for sure. he keeps his money, goes home to Denver and not have Dumars blaming him for 6 straight eastern finals. <br>  <br>  Iverson loses. he wont get an extension, packs bags again and have Dumars blaming him for not reaching east finals. <br>  <br>  Dumars also wins. people think his a genius and gets iverson wholl easily get blamed for ruining detroit.  |`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	No one wins. This was about clearing cap room and trying to land Lebron James. Even with A.I. the Pistons are not going to keep Boston from the finals....Denver quickly learned that Iverson did not mean they could contend against the Lakers, Rockets, or Jazz, and Carmelo Anthony wants to be the only big fish in that Denver pond... he could never mesh with the Answer. Basically it is two franchises rebuilding and trying to sell their fans that they have both improved because of the trade. Iverson is not John Stockton... I don't know how Joe Dumars will get him to pass the ball.|`|16846f69e9f2c7715f01b43ed1707e57aa	Hopefully detroit. If allen iverson ever gets it, he will realize that any team is better off with him playing like a PG not a SG. Please allen, I would love to see you play better team basketball by sacrificing some of your scoring for a better run offense.|`|nZtKV1Dxaa	Neither because iverson will just ruin detroit offense and Mcdyess said he would rather retire than wear a nuggets uniform so basically it was just ai for billups and the rookie.|`|EKoLfk03aa	i live in denver and never was and never will be a nugget fan even if chauncy is part of the team the nuggets are still gonna suck and chauncy won't still around that long anyways.<br>  <br>  Antonio mcdyss plans to resign with the pistons when he becomes a free agent so don't get all excited because of chauncy being  traded to the sorry azz nuggets.
ZFTkBTvvaa	blazers have won everygame at the rose garden against lakers since 04 05, and its not chaging anytime soon|`|NEtVRjplaa	I think it will be a close game as well, but I think the Lakers got this.<br>  <br>  Lakers by 10.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Everybody is jinxing the Blazers.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	I smell a blowout, this happens everynight on YA. someone predicts an upset, and that team gets blown out.

Im a Lakers fan, and as you seen, LAkers look like they have stumbled the some games. And the main reason why is Kobe. Im not dissing kobe, but its just that he shoots too much, and tonight he shot 11-29 missing 18 shots with 26 points. LAkers mostly lose when Kobe shoots over 20 attempts from the field. So i kind of miss the Kobe that passes the ball and becomes the facilitator making everyone in the team touch the ball instead of the kobe that hogs the ball. He should make shots wen he is wide open and pass the ball wen he is double teamed. He has been averaging 4 assist pg. and you know what else is messing things up? The bench, they also have been a problem. But no worries, LAkers are still ontop and Bynum will be back soon.
UYPfC5YVaa	Still LeBron James! He still leads in the statistical race.|`|GswnLKtQaa	It's a 3 man race between Wade, Kobe & Lebron. but the way D-Wade is playing and carrying the Heat now I have to pick him.|`|HiuNSScLaa	hell no wade over kobe kobes #s is not that good there as good as bosh #s except with a 61 point game its wade then lebron|`|73c54edf17bc6e46f1b58fc8f251941faa	Wade for MVP!|`|wVvfFgX5aa	Yao Ming|`|qtwYHyH5aa	wade|`|rYqBGkwjaa	LeBron, If he doesn't win then the NBA is rigged.<br>  <br>  MVP Running...<br>  1.

Tim Duncan fundamentally sound, he was the player that changed the fortunes for the Spurs and is still the Spurs anchor making them perrenial title contenders.<br>  <br>  9. Jerry West if you doubt me you will just have to research. He won't get the honor of having his silhouette as logo if he's shabby.<br>  <br>  10. Hakeem Olajuwon - the fact that he won the rings in the 90's proves his worth, one of the only one to record a quadruple double (arguable made two in his career although that one game is not recognized by the league).

If it's a league among friends or just a public league, then it's just a smalldick strokin' it. The guy sure is stupid if he thought noone would think that trade stunk.

3Ej9Z0Ezaa	Yes, I think so. Rampage got his title shot with Liddell after just one previous fight, so he already got his shot. Lyoto has earned his title shot by beating everyone they put in front of him and every round. In the end though, I think they will eventually be matched up against each other, because whoever of the two that ends up fighting Rashad will in my mind beat Rashad. Don't get me wrong I have a lot of respect for Rashad and i know he is good, but as good of a wrestler and athlete he is, I think Lyoto and Rampage are better "fighters". <br>  <br>  Lyoto will eventually be champion and I don't see anyone beating him!|`|CdAE4nXcaa	yes and he may still have his chance to get it before rampage, i saw in a interview that rampage doesn't know if he'll be able to take that fight because once again it's so short notice he's had 2 fights in the since december, and got rushed into this coming up with rashad, said he's going to try to do it, but isn't sure if he'll be able too. he also said he was over trained for his fight against jardine. so i hope machida gets to kick rashad's ***|`|3vjBXCGbaa	so you consider fighitng Sam Hoger(decision), David Heath(decesion), Nakamura(decision), Sokoudju(sub), Ortiz(dec), and Thiago Silva(which i give him credit for) is a "tougher road" in the UFC than fighting Marvin Eastmen(ko), Chuck Liddell(ko), Dan Henderson, Forrest Griffin(which i dont beleive he lost), Wanderlei Silva(ko) and Jardine????.... everythings going perfect, considereing rampage is still suppose to have the belt, Griffin did not win that fight against him, .... and Lyoto will get his title shot against the winner and lose|`|AA10069553	It;s more business than anything. Rampage will sell way more than Machida ever will (as it looks). But Machida is getting a title shot. He will wither face Rashad in May or whoever is the champion in late summer (August possibly). Dana talks about it at the UFC 96 post fight conference.|`|ly6R5qICaa	I think he does...hes undefeated and has beaten some tough opponents with ease and he is a very unorthodox and tactical fighter and i do think he has a better shot then rampage.|`|ULw1777caa	Well, Rampage shouldn't have lost it in the 1st place.  But, Machida has paid his dues.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	I can't see holding Rampage back.  He deserves to be where he is, no question.  That said, because Machida has come so far and put so much horse work in, he may be being saved for the winner of Jackson and Evans.|`|Qz80EA45aa	I do. Beating Wanderlai Silva, and Jardine was no easy feat for Rampage. But Machida has beaten everyone he has faced. And he has faced some stiff competition himself. Not only has he beaten Tito Ortiz, Kaz Nakamura, and Sokoudju, he totally destroyed a very dangerous Thiago Silva in his last fight. Not to mention he has pre UFC wins over B,J, Penn, Rich Franklin, and Stephan Bonnar. That a fine career resume for any fighter, and he has done all that BEFORE his first career loss.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Not really. I want to see Machida get the title shot but Rampage has faced much tougher opposition.<br>  <br>  Other than Tito what top guy has machida faced. I think Machida will get the shot soon enough but at the moment Rampage has higher quality wins|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Your probably right, but Rampage will sell tickets and PPV's|`|moa4kjSFaa	rampage will make waaaaaay more money <br>  so no <br>  plus rampage beat and fought <br>  better opponents
ZKikquiOaa	Arrow rest, I'd stick with a Hoyt Super Rest, it might be cheap but it's still a world class rest.  Many 1300's have been shot with that "cheap" rest.  At only $3 a piece you can buy a handful.<br>  <br>  Plunger, forget the Cartel ones, they don't work.  Go for at least the Shibuya DX plunger.  When you get it, replace the metal tip button with the teflon one, it should come with both types.  The Shibuya DX costs about $30 and will perform just as well as the $140 Beiter plunger.  I just like the Beiter because it's easier to play around with different tuning than the Shibuya.  With the Shibuya you tune the bow and you leave it there.  With the Beiter you can tune it for one set of arrows and tune another set and go back and forth between the two sets with almost no problems at all.<br>  <br>  Stabilizer, www.altservices.biz had a sale on the Win&Win HMC long rod a few months ago.  See if they still have that for sale it's a world class stabilizer for sale at an entry price($55 normal price $90).  Other than that, the Cartel stabilizer might fit the bill.  I do have a friend who broke his Cartel, then again the guy is a woodworker, his hands are like metal vises.  I can see him twisting the stabilizer in so hard that it just snaps.  I also know another guy that is happy with his Cartel and he's shooting a $1500 Fiber Bow.

Tu peux toujours rêver. <br>  Elmander ne marquera pas 4 buts et je crois même que s'il joue contre Lyon il ne marquera pas du tout car il ne veut pas prolonger son contrat à Toulouse afin de pouvoir partir s?rement à l'étranger alors, il va jouer cool pour ne pas se blesser avant de faire une <bonne affaire>.<br>  Désolé pour toi mais il m'étonnerait même vu le résultat (3-1) que les Toulousains ont pris à Valenciennes, ils gagnent ce soir contre Lyon...<br>  Reviens un peu les pieds sur terre et souhaite que ton équipe-fêtiche fasse bonne figure dans notre championnat mais ce n'est pas gagné, je crois bien qu'ils vont <ramer> quelques temps.<br>  <br>  ______<br>  <br>  Petite mise au point :<br>  Juste une petite précision pour C'hache, qui dit que je n'y connais rien au football, désolé, j'ai  plus de 50 ans de pratique sur les terrains et dans les tribunes et je peux te dire que c'est toi qui n'y connais rien au foot. Quand tu dis que Toulouse joue un football TOTAL, réveille-toi, à Valenciennes ils ont tellement joué un football TOTAL qu'ils en ont pris 3 et je te rappelle que l'année dernière, outre le fait qu'ils ont pris une raclée sur leur terrain contre les Nantais qui sont descendus ensuite en L2, tes Toulousains se sont qualifiés en Ligue des Champions (sauf si comme prévu ils se font exploser par Liverpool) grace à la connerie de supporters nantais qui ont envahi le terrain à l'avant-dernier match. <br>  Alors pour les le?ons, c'est quand tu veux. <br>  Tu es bien ce que j'appelle un vrai supporter de tribune, je serai même étonné qu'un jour tu aies tapé dans un ballon de cuir ou chaussé des crampons.<br>  Allez, bonne chance au TFC pour les 3 ou 4 prochains matchs, avec leur football TOTAL ils vont en avoir besoin !!! Mdr.|`|2UQoitDqaa	même en envoyant l'équipe de foot handisport de Lyon les toulousains ne seraient pas capable de mettre un but et même de s'en prendre 1 !<br>  Aller les gones !|`|HESeYJWFaa	arrête la fumette ?a ne te réussi pas.

Certes, milan a perdu par un but d'écart face au deuxième du championnat italien. Pas une tole, tt simplement 1 - 0... Ca reste honorable je dirais. Ce qui n'a pas été le cas d'une équipe de guignols qui a perdu contre le 17ème du championnat francais... Certes, vous avez marqué trois buts! Dommage que deux d'entre eux sont rentrés dans les mauvaises cages ^^<br>  <br>  Mais bon, t'en fais pas, le ridicule n'a jamais tué, et tu pourra continuer longtemps à mener une existence pathetique sans que cela ne menace ta faculté a persister dans l'être!!

Toulouse contre Liverpool combien déjà le résultat? Marseille ont gagné hier on va le savoir oui c'est bien pour le foot fran?ais et après y a rien de fait! <br>  Tu fais vraiment de la peine sérieux, tu crois trop que Toulouse est un grand club déjà pour commencer tu as dis merci à Nantes pour la qualif en coupe d'Europe?|`|Y6EWmhkgaa	battre liverpool au premier tour n'est pas un gage de victoire d'autant plus qu'il reste 4 matchs dont 2 contre porto (qui a une bonne petite equipe) et le retour contre liverpool qui prendra l'om pour autre chose que des guignols. ceci dit personne n'attendait porto et monaco en finale en 2004 alors pourquoi... fo juste pas s'enflammer de cette victoire et avancer sereinement. la vérité d'un match n'est pas celle d'une saison parce qu'a ce rythme la auxerre gagne la coupe d'europe biento (ben ouais ils ont battu marseille donc liverpool)... j'appliquerai le mm commentaire pour toulouse... <br>  maintenant il est vrai que le tfc et l'om ont tous les deux réalisé une grosse perf et que ?a met du baume au coeur apres les scores de volley qu'on avait chopé entre rhone et saone|`|I5WxlBOVaa	il te faut pas grand chose pour t'enflammer toi !<br>  On en reparlera dans quelques mois, avec les tours suivants ...<br>  Notre L1 est à des années lumières des grands clubs européens (voir le match Barca-OL par exemple ...)<br>  Se voiler la face suite à une victoire ne fera pas avancer les choses dans le bon sens<br>  ;-)|`|oajWiKhqaa	garde la tête froide
xRaGyugTaa	ben il regarde ses meilleurs joueurs partir mdr ...|`|4f7c784130ec3dd4f06d897acec05c70aa	Je suis toulousain. Franchement je m inquiete pas du tout. Douchez je  n etais pas fan et carasso est largement meilleur fait moi confiance. Mathieu a un grOs potentiel mais il n est pas assez regulier, surTout defensivement. Au milieu on perd emanA c 'est vrai, mais bon on va recuperer 10 millions... Et en plus Didot est tres tres tres fort. Cest un regulateur de milieu de terrain sa va nous changer de la chevre nommée dieuze.... Par contre, il faut ABSOLUMENT ne pas se tromper sur le choix de notre futur attaquant... Ce qui m inquiete c'est que la cellule de recrutement du TFC n'est pas tres performante.... A part pour Elmander.. Mais bon combien de joueur bidon sont venus jouer chez nous... Jonsson, Fabinho, Pavel fort, Okokojvic, etc etc... Par contre en ce qui concerne le suedois Braaten je le sens pas trop lui...<br>  En tout cas l equipe a besoin d un renouvellement, dommage que Baup ne soit plus la|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Entre Douchez et Carasso le différentiel n'est pas énorme. Didot est tout à fait capable de faire oublier Emana dans un registre différent toutefois. Elmander c'est une grosse perte, sportive déjà tant le suédois a influer sur les résultats du club la saison passé mais aussi financièrement, j'ai pas la chiffres mais je pense pas que le suédois ait été cédé au prix fixé l'an dernier. Je ne connais pas bien Braaten mais bon ?a doit pas être un ténor non plus, Bolton étant l'une des plus mauvaises attaques de Premier League. Matthieu même s'il est assez irrégulier reste un bon joueur avec une grande polyvalence et un vrai apport offensif.|`|dd746b15e20c5f642fc6e3b62e490244aa	Je comprends ton inquiétude. Il y a des fois où on se demande ce que font les sois disant spécialistes du foot... En tout cas, vous avez récupére Didot et crois moi celui là c'est un craque! Y'a que Lacombes pour ne pas s'en rendre compte...|`|8XURzFwRaa	ha tu sais la ligue 0 est dur, y a de grosses équipes! encore plus dur que la ligue 1 lol|`|I8cSJotlaa	Douchez est à rennes (jcomprends pas pourquoi ,rennes à déja du monde....)<br>  <br>  <br>  Vous avez récuperé didot pour une bouchée de pain quand on connait le talent du bonhomme.<br>  Merci moustache .........|`|WVGbJd0Maa	franchement je comprend pas les choix de Toulouse on comprend mieux le départ de baup<br>  disons Toulouse relégable il ne reste plus que deux place a éviter pour les autres|`|xvvHQ78raa	Didot et Braaten sont aussi de très bonnes recrues pour le TFC. Je suis un supporter rennais, et je suis très triste de voir un joueur comme Didot partir.

Qz80EA45aa	I think so. At first I thought that its was a decent( from their standpoint) marketing ploy to get young children to watch the pre-race with their parents. And of course to ask those parents to buy them some Digger swag. But having watched it with children present, even they are are fed up with Digger.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I think we are stuck with it for the long haul. Fox hasn't been to willing to drop a gimmick, even after it is well played out. Boogity Boogity Boogity, is a prime example.<br>  <br>  I'll probably have to drop my non violence stance, and smack the first of my racing pals I see wearing a Digger T-shirt.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Yes, but its $$$$$ and its gonna sell T-shirts, caps and little stuffed Diggers.. Makes me want to barf.  Grown men having to put on a act like they enjoy it on TV, Fox you are sick, this is a total gimmick to attract young kids to the sport, so they will want to come to the race and see Digger, resulting in more money spent. I'd love to see them Goodyears run over this dang varmit.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I think you guys are just exploiting how "uptight" you are by complaining about a freakin' cartoon. Worry about something more real, like what you see happening in your community on the 10 0'clock news.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Karl, dalejr4 the camera angle is far from new..<br>  It just never had a name, or sold T-shirts, and dolls..|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Well, I caught your Polls and Surveys question first, so I'm just going to copy and paste my answer over here.<br>  <br>  Fox's NASCAR coverage is a joke, and Digger is a prime example of that.  I don't have an issue with Digger, but I do have an issue with seeing Digger 700 times a race.<br>  <br>  I've pretty much quit watching the prerace for a number of reasons.  Digger by himself wouldn't keep me from watching it-I'd just change the channel when it comes up- but Digger certainly hasn't helped my views on the prerace on Fox.  Plus, why do we need an hour-long prerace for every race anyway?|`|i8soZLfRaa	No, "overboard" is the Ghecko <sp>, the caveman or the duck. Fox has gone into the outer limits with the gopher cam. It was a novel idea at first, went overbooard with the fan voting for a name, and has gone beyond even "planetoids" this year.<br>  <br>  And to think the whole concept is "borrowed" from US Navy PLAT cameras mounted in the flight deck of aircraft carriers to aid in landing.<br>  <br>  Jeez, enough already, give us the cool camera shots without all the hype.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Rich, the Navy has had deck-mounted PLAT cameras since the 50's. You helped me make my point. I know it's nothing new.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yes, they really have. I think the camera angles are pretty cool, but they spend way too much time devoting Digger. NASCAR fans want to watch racing, not cartoons. The merchandise has gotten way out of hand, too. When Jeff Burton had grass stuck in his splitter yesterday, Darrell Waltrip said that he hopes Digger isn't stuck in there. I think that's just ridiculous considering Digger is just a cartoon.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Yes they have. I agree with dalejr4ever. I really like the camera angle and everything and it gets some great shots of the cars going by but I can do without digger. They miss the timing half the time when they do the little gopher thing anyways. The cars have done gone by and digger is still looking for lap cars i guess.|`|D69XI2LLaa	YES! They usually do with everything!|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	I agree with Fluffy there's lots of greater worries now a days. Besides I know it keeps my kids interested in the whole race. They used to get bored after like an hour.|`|UyvkM7feaa	you think?<br>  <br>  I am an animal lover but I will shoot those things. Instantly.|`|G1r4Go1Taa	Yes, when people turn on the TV they want to see racing not a gopher!|`|o6PwjLnSaa	It's just another way to make money.  They know we can't do anything about it.  It's best to stop complaining and just accept the fact that we can't change the situation.  (Even though I'm fed up with it as well)  I'm not going to let "Digger" ruin the sport of Nascar...or Fox's coverage of it for that matter.|`|EA379aTYaa	It was cute the 1st time but now it is very annoying. Wastes a lot of time. Just like that song "Let's go racing boys" annoying. Fox needs to grow up.|`|GCOrku95aa	As if NASCAR didn't have enough haters across the nation, now we have a gopher for a mascot.|`|ndX4Je5Oaa	yeah too overboard|`|54d87ada5cbd610e99a576802ad52e06aa	Well I like digger he covers the race with his under ground cameras.|`|smDClNDkaa	YES!!!<br>  <br>  Digger needs to DIE.<br>  <br>  The camera can stay, that stupid Gopher needs to be run over or shot.|`|ec96a7005525b280dafea257208badeeaa	way way overboard!first time i seen it I went" you got to be f@#$ing kidding".second time I changed the chanel.|`|SzuSqKR0aa	I like Digger  hes cute and my girls think hes funny and cute too!|`|3jzqG7Oqaa	Yes. thanks for asking, i just wanna rip that thing out of the tv and shoot it with a BB gun.|`|a8EndhDmaa	yeah shooot the lil bastard|`|AA11264416	well i think its just for the kids really, plain and simple for the kids, ya its kind of annoying for us "adults" but i think its really just for the kids|`|1r05fktRaa	yes
DLxh9CANaa	The reason you've never seen a 2 year old TB in a steeplechase race is because they DON'T RUN them at that age in that type of race, because the extra effort required to jump fences at high speeds puts ENORMOUS stress on the bones and joints of the animals, and most 2 year olds have neither the maturity nor the growth to handle that kind of pressure. They'd break down if they were raced- so people don't do that. Most steeplechase horses are allowed to grow up and become mature animals before they are raced- the average age of the ones in this country alone is between 6 and 10, which is in sharp contrast to the average age at which most flat racers run. Steeplechase horses also LIVE LONGER and stay sound for a much longer period of time than their flat racing counterparts do, simply because they get to grow up and become strong, which is not true of flat racers. I've even heard of steeplechasers which retired from that sport and then went on to become top Eventers or field hunters- and they make great ones, because these are animals which truly LOVE to run and jump, and excel at it. <br>  <br>  Another aspect to the steeplechasers, which is not common in the flat racing world is that most of the male steeplechase horses are usually geldings, whereas with flat racers, the emphasis is on keeping colts entire as much as possible and for as long as possible because of their potential to earn big bucks as sires. Steeplechasing as a whole is a smaller sport than flat racing- and it's still common in some areas to see amateurs riding in such races. Because of this, the emphasis on getting horses to win as much as possible and then hit the breeding sheds is not as great, and those persons who DO breed these animals can afford to be highly selective about who gets bred to or with whom. One side effect of this is that we've seen FAR FEWER ISSUES with steeplechase races than we have with the flat ones- in fact, I can't remember the last time I heard about any major steeplechase horse breaking down during a race, it's been so long. These horses are older when they run, and most are healthier- and it SHOWS. The flat racing community would do well to take some lessons from their jumping brethren- the sport would be so much better off if they did.|`|PwZZJh1taa	some horses do both, and all horses can jump and run. they learn both just the same.<br>  <br>  timber hoppers are not going :21 :44 :56 1:09 hence the less break downs Starlit

UE2wUzs1aa	You can never have too much RB depth so keep them.  I'd probably drop Vincent Jackson.  He's not a real stud WR.  <br>  <br>  Now, who to pick up is a tough one.  All of those Qb's are pretty equal at this point.  Grossman and Collins are out in my book.  They just don't put up good numbers.  Frerotte is in a running offense and doesn't do too much.  Garcia is decent.  But he can give you those real stinker games.  <br>  <br>  I think it comes down to Quinn, Hill, and Thigpen.  I don't know if you can wait until after this week to see how those 3 do or if that would be too late.  Quinn played well vs. the Broncos and has good weapons around him.  Hill is in a pass first system in Martz.  And Thigpen has put up decent numbers but is on an awful team.  I'd rank them Hill, then Quinn, and then Thigpen.|`|Zg0kIoxGaa	I would say drop david garrard.  Jeff Garcia has been pretty consistant the last few outings and he plays against mostly weak pass defenses the next 5 games.|`|mlU5u7Nfaa	Pick up Brady Quinn or Kerry Collins. Shaun Hill looks nice, but monitor him for now|`|2ZKZZWM7aa	If u ask me ur team is lookin pretty good but if u have to pick some one up......well i would say drop Dallas Clark cuz u already have a consistent TE that has passed his BYE so there should be no reason to have a backup instead of a good QB. i would then pick upBrady Quinn because it is looking like he is going to be named starter and is sure to produce so that should give u another fairly solid option.......though if ur looking for someone to play this week i would grab Collins cuz hes been producing consistently lately.<br>  <br>                         hope i could help enough to earn 10 points!!!|`|1Nd16bO0aa	I would sign Brady Quinn or Kerry Collins because they are both really good and great and Brady is young too!|`|JVkKdVuMaa	I like your lineup but if you are looking to make a quarter back change, i would get rid of Garrard.  He has been somewhat inconsitent and after all, it is jacksonville.  So, your best option might be jeff Garcia because he has good receivers in antonio bryant and joey galloway.  Otherwise, I f you don't like him i would give Quinn a shot becasue obviously he did fairly well tonight and will probably do so again in the future.  Just don't pick him up this week becasue he already played.  So Garcia is your best option if anyone|`|TFGo3ilwaa	Quinn he looked good unless you need a starter for Sunday|`|dywILy7oaa	I would drop Tim hightower or steve slaton and pick up probably garcia or quinn. more than likely i would go with Garcia because even though quinn did good today he did it against a struggling Denver Defense. Kerry Collins would be another good choice but Garcia i think would be a better choice

xQFWjFyZaa	3rd Base. <br>  <br>  2nd Base is pretty deep. There are decent guys like Howie Kendrick and Robinson Cano into the 12-16th rounds, but at 3rd Base, the guys who will be left at that point are Adrian Beltre and Edwin Encarnacion. Those are not guys you can build a fantasy team around.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	2B by a long shot.<br>  <br>  The middle infield and catcher are the three hardest positions to fill. This is because their lack of depth.<br>  <br>  3B has a bunch of good players, and a bunch of decent players on top of that. In a standard 12 man league, there are more than enough 3B for everyone. So you don't get A Rod or David Wright. Down on the list are Garret Atkins, Kevin Youkilis, Chipper Jones, and even farther down Mark DeRosa and Alex Gordon are still solid fantasy picks.<br>  <br>  2B on the other hand significantly drops off after the top (Utley, Kinsler, Pedroia, Phillips) Guys that someone always gets stuck with in leagues are guys like Aviles of KC or Rickie Weeks of Mil. While they aren't terrible, I'd rather have Alex Gordon and company over them.<br>  <br>  So needless to say, 3B has a lot better depth making 2B harder to fill. The only argument for 3B in this, is that because of the depth at 3B, some players usually take extra 3B for UTIL purposes. This would make a shortage, but 1B and OF are the predominant UTIL player so it's usually not an issue.<br>  <br>  Just because 3B goes earlier in the draft doesn't mean that 3B is harder to fill. In a draft you should be paying attention, and you should be drafting with the draft. If the 3B go early, you need to hop on one, if the 2B go early, you need to hop on one. I have drafted Melvin Mora in the 19th round this year. And he was available in the 15th in my other league, I just passed him by because I didn't need him. Mora is a legitimate 3B and should have another solid year.|`|kuYsbZ9kaa	3B because beyond A Rod, David Wright, Evan Longoria, Aramis Rameriez There really is not much value.  2B seems to go deeper with Ian Kinsler, Chase Utley, Dustin Pedroia, Alxei Rameriez, Robinson Cano, Dan Uggla, Brandon Phillips, and more...|`|7LKY2862aa	Enjoy my new independant fantasy sports site.

xQFWjFyZaa	I'd rather have Wright/Damon. Wright is now, arguably the most valuable player in the league with A-Rod going down because 3rd Base has become even less deep than it was before. Johnny Damon may not be what he used to be, but he is still a solid 3rd OF for a Fantasy team. <br>  <br>  Zimmerman hasn't really lived up to his potential in Washington. I think Ichiro is way overrated. You can find his stats many rounds later, or with a combonation of speed and average guys. Adam Dunn is pure power. His average and strikeouts make Fantasy players cringe, but his power numbers make him ownable. Also remember, Team A gets to add an additional player. Whoever that may be could sway this trade well in Team A's favor.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	id say team A gets the better end because Johnny Damon has been a wash up ever since he left the Red Sox|`|kuYsbZ9kaa	Team B definitely.<br>  <br>  David Wright is an elite fantasy player and with A rod now out he is easily the top 3rd baseman by a long shot.  Also, Johnny Damon is still the leadoff hitter for the Yankees and will score a ton of runs. he also had a pretty good year last year.<br>  <br>  Adam Dunn is a great homerun hitter, however if your league subtracts points for strikeouts that will just kill his value. Ryan Zimmerman has been quite the disappointment for fantasy owners in the past and there is no reason he wont be this year, you could probably get just as good of a third baseman off the waiver wire.  Ichiro is the best player that team a would receive and his value is diminishing along with the not so great mariners offense.<br>  <br>  Team B definitely gets the better deal!|`|qFuIfIqSaa	Team A for sure. Damon is garbage now. Zimmerman gets better each year, Dunn is got for 40+ homers 100+ rbis (last 3 years he has anyways) and ichiro will bring the average up that dunn lacks.<br>  <br>  On a side note, want to join a another fantasy baseball league. We're looking for experienced managers who will edit their lineups daily, and are very competitive and have a proven record.

T5UBrKZjaa	A pitcher (on a fastpitch softball team) is probably the most important position and most valuable to the team. Usually, as the pitcher goes, so does the team. Be proud that he thinks that much of you.<br>  <br>  First, you need to tell the coach. Next you need some minor adjustments on your release with a professional. Ask your coach, or look in your area for one. Check out their background. YOU DO NOT want someone who just pitched last season...once again look at their background, (high school, college, Pro?). A pitchers resume will tell you alot about her.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Stop hitting yourself.... Seriously, that is not normal for a good release point. You usually do that when you are guiding the ball, you use your thigh to stop your hand at the release point. Wearing pads as a solution usually makes the problem worse because you can sometimes feel like hitting it harder is OK. You need a pitching coach to help with your release point and your arm is probably going way outside which can also kill your velocity. Tell your coach about the pitching problem - this is not just an issue with bruises it will also be an issue with control at some point - bruises on the back of your pitching hip should be more common that your thigh. Your release issue depends on whether it is the ball or your hand that causes the bruise.
Nuj1eScCaa	Defensively about a 6. The Lakers haven't defended the 3 point line well at all thus far. Pryzbilla with 8 points already? That's just terrible.<br>  <br>  LAL - 32 <br>  POR - 49|`|vJyF8siJaa	defence 5 but offence 2.5, they're slumping right now.<br>  <br>  BQ: hopefully they'll make a run and closen the gap before halftime.|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	I hope the Blazers win this one<br>  <br>  <br>  #1 Rockets Fan|`|bMJryv8Naa	0|`|qtwYHyH5aa	1|`|uxregJ0faa	Haha our bum As Lakers.<br>  <br>  Yea i see them making one of their comebacks today.

KDOIKIq2aa	There are a few good gunsmith colleges out there.  If I wanted to be a gunsmith and was younger I'd look at joining the navy as a machinist.  Then take my GI bill and go to college that has a gunsmith program.  From there, your either going to go to work for a company or another gunsmith and learn from them or jump in with both feet and open your own shop.
e0M5lpc2aa	The reason is because we (I say we because I am a Phillies fan) didn't go get any "superstar" players. The Mets went out and spent an arm and a leg on their bullpen, which was horrible last year, and now have a pen that legitimately competes with ours. We, the Phillies, on the other hand went out and got Raul Ibanez, whom no one cares about even though he is a better, quicker version of Pat Burrell, and Chan Ho Park to compete for our 5 spot with Kendrick and the young and talented Happ.<br>  <br>  I find it funny that the Phillies are not the team to beat, but this just gives them more motivation to come out and win again. They want it again, and returning an improved version of the team only makes them stronger. In the end, if the Mets outplay the Phillies, power to them, but for now the Phils are number 1 in the East.<br>  <br>  Just some more Phillies support here:<br>  Not only did Howard come in 20lbs down, but Myers came in 30lbs down. Also, John Mayberry Jr. is hitting and will be a great bench player. Jason Werth and Geoff Jenkins both have guns for arms and should have another great tandem year in the OF, accounting for 35+HR and 120RBI between them. Also, Pedro Feliz is probably going to be one of the best 7th hitters in the game. And who can argue about the Rollins, Utley, Howard combo. Three players who start the year with legitimate MVP candidacy. Let's go Phils!|`|mudP2e53aa	idk all I no is the Mets really beat there selfs for the phillies to win the NL East 2 straight year but in 2009 the Mets are gonna be that 2006 team Phils are good but there not better then the Mets Mets got a better Bullpen in thats all they had to fix Mets blown 29 saves last year if they at least won 10 of those blown saves they would of been had the NL East so Phillie fans gotta thank us for the credit we gave to them|`|V430UrvFaa	I think that the Phillies have always been underrated compared to the Mets, but I believe the Phillies will do better than the mets anyway. I think that most people who are not Phillie fans don't think they are going to make the world series, but making the playoffs? that is a huge possibility.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Because Phillies are now the team to beat.<br>  <br>  Every team in the MLB now want to take the WS from the Phillies this year<br>  <br>  It's simple,<br>  If your the Champion,<br>  You will be hated and beloved.
Uyz6iZwKaa	I think it depends on the severity of the charge if they should be stood down or not. It should be addressed at the time it happens and then if it happens in the future the severity of the punishment should be kept the same for the same offence.<br>  <br>  I think maybe the NRL should have a say in whether a player is alowed to play or not and police all clubs the same way.<br>  <br>  However, you have to ask the question: If manly do stand Brett down and he doesn't play and they get beat, and the police find it was all a sham, how ripped off are the supporters and team going to feel?<br>  <br>  It is a tough area to address!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I agree with you totaly. Stewart and the Bronco's players play on. Bird gets stood down. Where's the consistency. It should be ahard and fast NRL rule. If left to the clubs they will abuse it.|`|OYy82bAYaa	Too true our NRL players are going through shet year in year out and I think its about time that all clubs put their foot down with their boys... get them to pull their heads out of their butts... everytime David Gallop has put his 5cents in he just makes things worse for the player and the club...|`|drEfr9waaa	Even a police charge isn't enough to prove guilt though so it all seems a little unfair to suspend players.  The players need to be convicted by a court of law before they're punished for anything.  It just seems that being stood down or suspended during investigation (ie prior to being convicted of a crime) could be considered punishing - even if that's not the intention.  I think the NRL should await convictions by the court or at least find out how the player is going to plea, before taking action.  I wouldn't leave it up to the clubs to decide, it should be a just process for all.|`|kecdkv6jaa	Each issue will be dealt with seperatley depending on it's severity.<br>  It is the clubs responsibility to introduce some sort of alcohol ban (not total ban, thats just UnAustralian!) If players get in to trouble because of alcohol they should be suspended from playing for a certain amount of games depending on what they done. But like Bill said there needs to be consistancy in the punishments, players shouldn't get away with things that others get suspended for.<br>  <br>  The media blows all these things out of proportion anyway. most of the time it's not as bad as it seems. Them journalists are just trying to earn some coin.|`|Xy1XH5gVaa	This sort of thing didn't happen on any sort of regular basis in the 1970's -80's. Perhaps they should be looking to the past to rectify some of these problems. Where the h*ll do these attitudes come from anyway, are they learning these behaviors at home ? Or from each other ? Don't care where it came from but it's got to stop NOW !|`|D83hvKf0aa	Whats to decide, once again another player from the team that won the grand final last year is accused of the same thing that players from the winning team the season before last, and so on and so on. You see a pattern here people. I don't believe anything other than he was blind drunk enough not to remember anything. Perfect target for any gold digger looking to get paid quickly. These girls really cheapen the crime that has truly affected real victims out there who go through constant counselling to deal with it. I guarantee she wont be in therapy at all let alone months/years that some friends had to.|`|EiVUIHh1aa	Just because they are football players does not give them the right to take advantage of any girls. So, he's a famous football player does that mean he's telling the truth? What about the 17 year old, she's a nobody so people assume she's lying.<br>  Too many times has football players misbehave and they come on TV to say they're sorry!!! No they're not, they're forced to say it coz they're back the next time doing the same sh***!!<br>  He should be kicked out of football, a lesson to all other players.|`|tsdutDH9aa	i think if nrl players are stupid enough to be out there getting drunk and letting people take advantage of them they should be banned from the game for a season and if it happens again they are out for good. there is nothing players hate more then not playing. they can pay a fine and go back to play the following week making money so a banning is sufficient .|`|OyAD7LXKaa	I don't think it should be up to the club to decide wether they are suspended etc, if they broke the law the authorities should deal with it, and they should play until proven guilty, even if under investigation. Brett Stewart (L) ; innocent.|`|OVSOfPm4aa	The only two people who know whether Stewart is guilty or innocent are the two involved so everyone else should keep an open mind which I know is unlikely on these pages...|`|uHaB5dehaa	all i can say its all bull sh.t if it was me or any other person from the public we would be charged and then its up to us to prove our innocence, these football player can escape murder
TbO83l3yaa	you will definetely not want a spring pistol even in backyard wars. i suggest you will want a Crossman Stinger Shotgun. this thing is amazing for backyard wars because it is easy to go rapid fire with the pump action. it goes 350 FPS which is great for backyard wars. the Magazine only holds around 20 rounds, but it is better than a pistol mag. plus extra mags are cheap. plus it is really durable.<br>  <br>  here is the site: <a href="http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/cb/cb.aspx?a=318796" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/cb/cb...</a>|`|o5LBP5ujaa	smith and wessons  m4505  311 fps  12 rounds per clip   leaves welts from 40 ft away   can shoot through both sides of a can point blank     about $30   usd  at dunhams sports comes with bbs  and gel target   and 2 magazines|`|1SygAcvJaa	KWC Delta Elite 1911.<br>  This is definitely the best spring pistol I have shot for the price, it is between $20-$30. It shoots nearly as well as every spring gun I have seen besides sniper rifles, the only downside is the small magazine capacity (12 rounds).|`|UyhnSF2haa	a good gun for you would be a shotgun you would have to buy that at Walmart because they sell guns under $60 and has 350-400 fps with hop up and there are desert eagles in pistols that go over 300 fps and $60 and under hope i helped.oh the shot gun hurts alot it leaves welts:)

AA10241450	Your second and third answers are approriate.  Most athletes say dynamic stretching or run drills is the way to go before you start running.  Look at the NY times video section for sports for the truth about stretching.  Good luck!|`|fzlHDkXbaa	This is what I do, it may not fit accordingly with other people though:<br>  <br>  1. Have a bit of water/gatorade<br>  2. Stretch<br>  3. Jump rope about 5 min.<br>  4. Run at low intensity<br>  5. Pick up pace after 10 min.|`|1UID5JtNaa	Static stretching has actually been shown to decrease muscle strength for a period of time after so I would never recommend it before a workout or race.  Dynamic range of motion exercises like leg swings, high knees, butt kicks are ok- and should be done after some easy jogging.  I would not do any type of stretch until after the workout.|`|2Orq8q5daa	yeh, always warm the body up a lil before stretching <br>  I do:<br>  1. warm up jog 800m at least<br>  2. some light static stretching<br>  3. then a little bit of dynamic stretching<br>  4. Drills (strides/high knees etc.)<br>  4. then get into the training|`|RpK7CoSHaa	800m warm-up, light stretch, drills (a skips, high-knees, butt kickers, etc., also wrok on form during drills), 10min. prgression warm-up run (start out slow, and increase your pace to almost race-pace), then get your spikes on and head to the starting line|`|LpsnLhVSaa	warm-up jog, stretch...well thats how my team did it.
vhcyobsJaa	- Have a reasonable goal going in<br>  - Start with a fairly reasonable split (2:10-2:12) and pick up the pace a notch every 500 meters so that the last 500 you are really pushing beyond your limit<br>  -sit next to someone you don't really like, or who is slightly better than you and you'd just love to beat. Crew girls tend to be insanely competative once the race begins<br>  -listen to good music with a steady fast paced beat<br>  -stay within sight of the coach... girls tend to pull a little harder if coach is watching<br>  -at the beginning when you're trying to pace yourself, to make sure that you pull hard, but you don't burn out too soon, you should make sure that your legs burn atleast a little after every stroke<br>    <br>  <br>  -warm up!!!! YOu think that it's bad and that your tiring yourself out before the peice even starts but if you go into the peice with a fast heartrate, then you don't have to build up after the start. This means that your muscles will receive sufficient oxygen from the start and you'll be able to pull harder.<br>  -Start with a power ten, your nerves give you extra energy that you'll only be able to utilize at the start<br>  -Do a power ten in which you pull like your life depended on it every 500 meters<br>  -Wear spandex, if your worrying about your shorts your time will falter<br>  -bump up the pace big time at 500 meters to go... then when you hit 200 meters to go pull as hard as you possibly can...harder than you ever have!! Each stroke is about 10 meters, so the 200 meter mark is your last twenty strokes.<br>  -focus not on the pain... but your breath... listen to your breathing.<br>  -get as much pull out of your swing as you can. Use you back muscles... next to your thighs your lats are the biggest muscles you've got. <br>  -don't tie your shoes too tight.. your toes will fall asleep mid peice and it will drive you MAD! lol<br>  <br>  - When it's all over... don't stop rowing. COOL DOWN. keep rowing for atleast three min. You could be pulling a 4:35 if you wanted, so long as you're moving. Not only is it very very good for you... it will impress your coach.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|avc7ixnxaa	The best thing to do is talk to your coach. They're the one that sees you row everyday at practice and know what goal(s) you should be looking to achieve. Instead of thinking of the 2k as 2000 meters, break it up. Think of getting through the first 1000 meters and then breaking up the last 1000 into two 500 meter pieces. For each of the last 500 meter pieces, try and drop a second from your split. ALWAYS try and go faster the second 1000 than the first 1000, even though you may be tired. Good luck!|`|WugvMAB2aa	Height is always an advantage in rowing. I rowed as well and was alot smaller than others in my club. Couldn't quite hit their split times if i was roughly the same fitness level.<br>  <br>  I would say:<br>  <br>  Train for stamina, endurance training. Interval training (fast bursts then rest period).<br>  <br>  I've heard that maintaining a pace you know you can keep for the duration is how to attack it. Rather than going too fast earlier on and running out of energy.<br>  <br>  I'd say 8:00 minutes is a fairly good time. Though if you were to go for a target, hit 7:30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Saying that, there was a guy in my club about 5'5 who could pull it under 7minutes. He was a machine.|`|XZTmOh1Caa	3 words... fly and die

Rivals hasnt even updated it yet.........those rankings arent relevant anymore..... but they have updated the front page with a new article, predicting Memphis to end up with perhaps the "Best class Ever"<br>  (<a href="http://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/barrier_noentry.asp?ReturnTo=&sid=&script=content.asp&cid=922296&fid=&tid=&mid=&rid=" rel="nofollow">http://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/b...</a> )<br>  ........... not to mention end up with BY FAR the #1 class this season. (over UNC). Memphis also still has John Wall on the table. If Memphis snags John Wall, I think they'll be the first team to ever have the top 3 rivals recruits in a class. Even Right NOW tho, I think Memphis would overtake UNC as #1 in the rankings, because of    PF Demarcus Cousins (#2) , SG Xavier Henry (#3), SG Nolan Dennis (#47), and both Will Coleman and Darnell Dodson from Miami Dade would easily be top 30-40 Rivals150 players.

If you could remember Garnett gave a nasty elbow at the side of Anthony Peeler in the 2004 western conference semis? Anthony Peeler was a teammate of Garnett for 5 years in Minnesota before transferring to the Kings in 2004. After getting hit at the side Peeler naturally retaliated resulting to this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPgRW48vNsQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPgRW48vN...</a><br>  <br>  What you don't see in the video is the blatant attck on Peeler before that incident. And because Garnett was the MVP of the season, the NBA sanitized again Garnett's image as if he did nothing to Peeler prior to that. LMAO.<br>  <br>  So if you only notice that now... I guess you're not that long watching games. It's Garnett's 'au naturale' always fired up and almost liking to pick up fights.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

uoZIYhJtaa	Turn it around and say why not just rush all 11 guys? Neither would work.<br>  <br>  If you had no pass rush and everyone in cover, the offense would run the ball.<br>  <br>  If you rushed all 11, the QB would throw a quick pass to a WR for a TD.|`|AA11108627	There's no law in football that says the defense HAS to rush anybody. But it is always to their advantage to do so.  That's why even on the last play of the game, when the offense is obviously planning a "Hail Mary" pass and you want to use as many defensive backs as possible, the defense will still rush 2-3 players on the QB.<br>  <br>  Re: the scenario you presented, even if the defense knew exactly what play the offense was planning, you still don't want the offense to "know that you know".  Good football strategy requires that you don't "show your hand".  To gain an advantage either offensively or defensively, you need to disguise your intentions as much as possible before executing the play.<br>  <br>  All the offense needs is one seam -- one opening -- through the defense to score a touchdown.  If the defense drops everybody, that gives the offense a chance to get a running start & be the aggressors in creating that seam.  <br>  <br>  You want your defense to pressure the offense continuously, and everywhere they go on the field.  This is why defenses are organized in layers -- a defensive line, linebackers, and defensive backs -- so the offense can be challenged at every possible level.<br>  <br>  Believe me, if there was any possibility dropping 11 players would be more effective, you would see it implemented by defensive coordinators.   I've never seen that done even once in the 40 years I've watched football.  Coaches know -- that stategy would not work.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	I've seen defenses rush only 2 guys and drop 9 into coverage.  Problem is any decent QB given time will find an open receiver, especially with the new rules on D about contact.|`|39d2f170b7ab29e80de1d05e4c44248baa	Even if all 11 dropped into coverage, someone would eventually get open with no pressure on the QB at all, and any pro QB can complete a pass when a receiver's only slightly open if they have time to plant and prepare themselves for a throw.<br>  <br>  Also, similar to a kickoff return a team with an athletic QB could form a kind of "Wedge" with the O-Line and gain 10+ yards every time by running.<br>  <br>  There's a reason nobody's ever done it that way.|`|PMluTf72aa	yes, it is possible to drop everyone into coverage.  there is no rule that states otherwise.  however, it is not suggested to do that as there would be no pressure applied on the QB.  inevitably, someone would get open or the QB would find a lane to run in to get yards.  remember, the WR has the advantage when running his route as he knows where he's going, the defense has to follow him, not having a clue where he'll end up.|`|a7bfee8f94afdfd3ac16e448849ea19faa	because the QB would hand the ball to the RB every time and there would be a touchdown every single drive. The coach would get fired monday morning. If you find out a coach has a game plan for a team to do that then I would recommend selling and pawning everything you own and putting that along with every penny of your life savings on that game, for the opponent. You'll double your net worth in a couple of hours.|`|pZyEFAtDaa	The object of the defense for pass plays is to make the quarterback get rid of the ball as quickly as possible, thereby making a bad throw, throwing an interception, or chucking it out of bounds.  Short of that, they pretty much want to kill him.  The best way to do this is the blitz.  These come from a variety of positions, and sometimes you will see a defensive lineman drop into the flat on coverage.  I think this happened in the last Superbowl.  It is risky as lineman typically don't have the hands that D-backs do.  If you did not rush the quarterback, he would pick you apart all day and score relentlessly.  Okay sometimes, but not always.  If a team makes 3.5 yards per snap, they will always get a first down in 3 plays.  They will chew up the field and the clock and beat you.  You have to stop them.  A rushing D is the only way.|`|f4ea933ff2710d6621207b1fad09d53aaa	i mean, it wouldn't be ideal b/c some defenses go 2-4-5 and have the two down linemen there just in case its a draw play or something. pittsburgh act like they will biltz and they run a 3-4 and don't blitz when they don't have to, sp they have about 8 guys in coverage and the other three down linemen in run support/pressure to the qb....but i don't really think that there is ever a play where less than two guys don't try to pressure the qb, but its close...so dropping 9 into coverage is about the most coverage a d will get|`|fyKSTMAfaa	I'm not sure you understand what a blitz is.  <br>  <br>  In a 4-3 defense, the job of the front four is to get a push up front, penetrate the line of scrimmage and get into the offensive backfield.  A blitz would be when a player off the line is being utilized to rush the quarterback or ball carrier, such as a linebacker, safety or cornerback.|`|3KsuT05Waa	because the quarterback can run the ball if everyone drops into coverage he can just rush the ball and still get at least 5 yards. That's why that is a terrible idea|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Anytime your dropping more than 8 guys, it's because you know the QB has to throw up a prayer and that he doesn't have much time left. It doesn't matter how many people you drop, if the you give the QB enough time he will find the open man. Even if its for 3 yard pops or an over the middle crossing route, someone will be open and there are so many different angles and routes the QB can throw to that its virtually impossible to defend all windows even with 11 guys. In football, the combination of pressure on the quarter back and good coverage are what makes defenses great. The reason great QBs today like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are reveered for being so relaxed, poised and calm in the pocket is because that is a defenses worst nightmare. Defenses need to hurry the QB into making a decision because he is more likely to make a mistake when he is being rushed,(thats why we call them pass rushers.) Bottom line, defenses need to pressure the quarter back, because dropping people only lets the guy get comfortable.
8bTder08aa	ME!  ME!  ME!<br>  <br>  Buffalo, I thought racing was going to heck in a handbasket in when they shortened the Gold Cup in 1976, and then again in 1990.  If Shuvee could win the Gold Cup at two miles TWICE, against males, and if Kelso could win it FIVE TIMES, what's the problem with horses running the distance nowadays?<br>  <br>  I adore horses that are at their best as the distances increase.  Yeats is my hero, he's going to try for a fourth Ascot Gold Cup this year. Vinnie Roe is another distance specialist;  and of course Makybe Diva down under, with her three consecutive Melbourne Gold Cups.  <br>  <br>  One of the vilest heresies I ever heard voiced was D. Wayne Lukas's suggestion that the Triple Crown races should be run at shorter distances.  The man should have his mouth washed out with soap, and be tarred and feathered and run back to the Quarter Horse tracks from whence he came for voicing that opinion.<br>  <br>  It's not just the classics that have been shortened.  Santa Anita used to run a series of races it called the "Hillside Distance Series."  These races were run as starter allowance races (i.e., to be eligible a horse had to have started in a claiming race of a specific price or lower-- "open to three-year-olds and upwards that have started for a claiming price of $6250 or less since January 1st").  These were great races!  <br>  <br>  If there is a resurgence in distance races, it has to be at all levels, not just at stakes levels.  When was the last time you saw a claiming race offered at 1-1/4 miles or longer?  <br>  <br>  If there is money to be made breeding horses that are best at a distance, people will breed horses to go after those races.  <br>  <br>  If I had my way, to try to bring back some of the soundness and toughness that used to characterize Thoroughbreds, these are some of the changes I'd mandate:<br>  <br>  No two-year-old races of any kind before September 1.  No two-year-old races would be allowed to have Grade 1 or Group I status.  And I'd eliminated the Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies and Juvenile.<br>  <br>  I'd change the Triple Crown to encompass the Derby at 1-1/4 miles, the Belmont at 1-1/2 miles and the Travers Stakes at 1-1/2 miles (I'd add the extra quarter to the Travers).  I'd put the Jockey Club Gold Cup back to two miles and add an extra $1 million to the purse.  I'd make the Breeders Cup Classic longer, at 1-1/2 miles, and I'd lengthen the Breeders Cup Turf to at 2 miles.<br>  <br>  I'd require racetracks to card two races longer than 1-1/8 miles every racing day.  I would refuse to make any race shorter than 1-1/8 miles Grade 1 or Group I.  And I would start a fund to provide a breeder's award for horses that won at distances of 1-1/4 miles and beyond.<br>  <br>  I would set up a bonus system to reward owners who kept Group I or Grade 1 winning stakes horses in training after their three-year-old season.  <br>  <br>  In my lifetime, I've seen the Thoroughbred change as money flowed to horses that won shorter races and had shorter but brilliant careers.  If money flows to horses that stay in training longer and win at longer distances, the Thoroughbred will change again.  If people are serious about bringing soundness, stamina, toughness and longevity back to the breed, then the horses that exhibit those characteristics have to be able to earn more, and be valued at stud more, than horses that are precocious, brilliant, unsound and devoid of stamina.  It's that simple.

5yZICXImaa	To succeed as a pitcher in the AL you need to be a really good pitcher.<br>  To succeed as a pitcher in the NL you need to be a good pitcher but pretty good batter also. So you could say that NL has better batting pitchers and AL has better Ace type pitchers. Therefore if they have better Ace type pitchers they have to have better batters to hit off them? Just throwing stuff out their for you to think about it.<br>  As A Jays Fan I Personally Prefer The A.L.|`|Iea4UeItaa	I prefer the NL style more.  There are more scenarios to think of with a pitcher batting and the double switch.  Managers must think of not only what pitcher to use in a later game situation, but what pinch hitter to use at a certain time in a game.  AL lacks that thought process.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	Preferably, coming from a Yankee fan, I favor the AL for two reasons. In the AL, there are DH's so you don't have to wait while your pitcher strikes out.

NvaK57Phaa	i think they're pretty good. you can always improve though. it's always good to at least bench press your body weight, but you may want to try to get that up to about 240 by next season. your squat has room for improvement as well. try to get that up to about 350 or so. for linebacker and tight end, you need lower body strength. from your description, you seem like a person that is very strong for his size, but you may want to consider gaining a few pounds, but not much. try to get up to about 190. try to hit the weight room more. your 40 time is good for your size as well. those are very good stats, but if you are playing OLB, you may want to get it down to about a 4.6 at least. i am very impressed with your stats though. just go out there and work hard.<br>  <br>  Good luck next football season!|`|Rjedkvi1aa	You'd be a good fill-in player when guys need a break..|`|UBrtJE9Baa	Not too bad but you are a little on the weaker side considering your positions.

You will learn to canter fairly quickly and a canter is a more controlled version of the gallop.  Horses in an ordinary riding barn are never asked to gallop.  Galloping is something that's only done at the race track.  I think you'll find that the canter is quite fast enough for a beginner rider.

BK1GjPT6aa	B.F.B is right, what are you fishing for? A buck tail jig is an all purpose deal and can catch Snook to Grouper and then some. I like to use a knocker rig with a circle hook baited with a whole ballyhoo. This is great for big snapper, grouper and whatever else is in the mood. Then again I'll fish the ends of the jetty with a balloon rig and go for kings and other Macks in the area as well as Tarpon and sharks. Then I'll fish the beach side of a jetty for Look Downs, Jacks and whatever. I can also fish the jetty itself for Sheepshead, Snook, Snapper, Angel Fish and so on.  Everything I mentioned requires different gear and line test as well as lure/ bait types. Unless you specify what you're after there's not really much to say but good luck.<br>  I can offer you a tip though. When you fish a jetty with heavy current, always cast opposite the current is going, keep your line taut and allow the lure/bait to swim past you  with the current. Cover all the levels of the water (top, mid and bottom bounce the rig.) for maximum coverage. Look for the bait balls ( pilchards or mullet ) and fish behind and under them, the larger fish are holding back waiting for the stragglers. It doesn't even have to be baitfish  they can also be balled up game fish like undersized snapper or whatever. Keep your eyes on the locals, if you see them catching fish you should follow their lead and do exactly what they do. Last but not least, do not over look the rocks under your feet. You're pretty much standing on the only structure about and where do you think the fish want to hide? Okay, I gave you a bunch of tips but it's better than nothing. Trial and error will lead the way and you shouldn't give up a spot if you don't catch a fish the first time  ( or few after) out. Learn it, live it, & love it.~good luck catchin'.|`|amlmhoUuaa	I would try using a super fluke or a spinnerbait.  Rock bass and stripers like both of them.

I'd also avoid using a .177 caliber pellet gun since .177 caliber pellets are awfully light for use on bigger small game animals like raccoons, possum, nutria, etc... That's not to say they might not work, but just that I'd be more comfortable shooting a .22 caliber pellet since it penetrates better and has more downrange energy, both of which are issues if you have to shoot through bone and muscle.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	adventuresinairgunhunting.com has some pics if you do a search on there site. the base of the ear is the best spot!

They have also beaten the Celtics and Nuggets without Iverson. I think the Pistons will beat Orlando. I think they can beat the Celtics and Cavs, but i think the Pistons will end up losing in the East finals if they don't play Iverson.|`|bcdda81b9d8d3b625f85a27ddaee6592aa	Nope <br>  I see the magics going way further then the pistons, especially if iverson is playing, have you noticed the record that they have without iverson|`|1a4f8OD1aa	i think the pistons would win if Allen iverson dont start. i think we need stuckey and rip in our back court if we are going to beat the magic|`|JV2mxI75aa	cavs and heat
tZPOSvHQaa	the bottom is your friend. As my mentor used to say, "if you're not getting snagged, you're not fishing in the right place!" The goal is to bounce you're live bait off of the bottom as it drifts naturally through the current (JRW Gang Hooks are the most natural way to present a worm in my opinion). This is accomplished by adjusting the number of split shot sinkers you add to your line. Start with two and make a cast. If you don't feel bottom throughout your drift, add another on the next cast and so on. Once you're bouncing bottom, you'll be able to feel it. And with practice, you'll be able to tell the difference between the bottom and a bite with ease.Look for deeper water. For the most part you'll want to spend 80% of your time on any given river fishing trip, fishing the deeper parts of the river. Deeper edges and riffles and of course pools are where a majority of the fish will congregate(especially in hotter weather. You don't want to get caught spending 80% of your time fishing the shallow riffles and 20% of your time fishing the beautiful pool below the riffles. And the deeper edges along most riffles (especially in the bend of the river) are generally more productive as well. Just remember: for the most part, deeper is better.<br>  <br>  These tips should save you time, and with any luck, help you catch more fish as well. So get out there and do just that. And remember what a very wise person once said, "a bad day fishing is better than a good day at work." Amen!|`|CBTAgeu4aa	Try a new spot.|`|amlmhoUuaa	You can never go wrong fishing points or channels try both using your basic bass lures. hope this helps good fishing.
UaZmYXJeaa	make sure you get out of the start fast. like as soon as your coach or the ref say GO or shoot the gun, you need to have fast reaction time and then go. also for your first 10m your head and body should be slightly bending over so it looks like youre a missle launching out.  and your arms should be pumped as fast as you can because the faster you pump them the faster you'll go. also, make sure you dont clinch your muscles, you need to stay relax. dont clinch your hands or mouth or even close your eyes. just look stright and focus at the finish line. even if you know youre near the finish line, dont even stop or slow down, keep going all the way till you pass the line|`|ckNjHiZzaa	Fourteen seconds or even faster is very doable!  First, have your coach check your form and give you tips on improving your economy of motion.  He/she is trained for that.  Then, practice what he says to do.  You won't get better by practicing your old style, that didn't work.  Practice does not make perfect.  Perfect practice makes perfect!|`|ocHNtbQZaa	Just get stronger and run short, top speed sprints. The fastest runners don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. Try standing leg press where you lift the weight with both legs but hold with one leg, on ball of foot, knee slightly bent. Hold as much weight as possible for 10-20 seconds. Do 4-6 holds on each leg a few times a week. Also run under distance sprints to practice running as relaxed as possible.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	practice. that's all there is to it. and at meets you'll probably do better because of adrenaline.
x9GODf8eaa	Spaceboy - People's expectations are too high for Jokinen. After that first period (which was very lucky) everyone is expecting him to light it up every night. Its going to take more time for him to get used to the system, and his new linemates. Give it a week, I bet you he is up to perfect form.<br>  <br>  I would have to agree with Phoenix. They made some moves that are definitely going to help in the long run. Hopefully their picks will help them become a team like Chicago a couple years down the road.<br>  <br>  I would have chosed Montreal as the worst. They had some problems to address, and did not.|`|AA12172407	All I know is that I was pulling for Olli to go light it up in Calgary. He impressed in his first period as a Flame, but has been frighteningly bad since. Strike one, Sutter.|`|LEQowzHCaa	I agree with you completely...<br>  <br>  Phoenix made some good trades at the deadline aquiring Nigel Dawes, Dmitri Kalinin, Petr Prucha, Scottie Upshall, Matthew Lombardi and Brandon Prust. They are a younger and more quicker team now. They also have some good draft picks...<br>  <br>  New York did pretty bad at the deadline (trading Bill Guerin) and they didn't make a lot of moves....|`|YPITuiMcaa	I would say that Minnesota would have to be among the bottom, because we fail each and every year at helping our team out

When air cools it can no longer hold that water and so it comes out of gaseous form and back to water. Your breath is warm and humid and carries water from your body and when it hits that cold window glass the rapidly cooling air gives up its moisture and deposits it on the glass as mist.|`|ZcV4zmpxaa	It's condensation. It's like this and its pretty cool if your driving in a car. Say like if the windows of your car windows are fogged up because of cold. Then turn on the cooler in the car which unfogs the windows when the windows are closed of course. Heat from breath causes condensation on the mirrors/windows when its cold or its rainy.|`|gELcwzNhaa	why is this question in this sector?
yYQsfnVGaa	The same happens to me all the time back then. It's either that your nervous or that your just making wrong shots with the incorrect techniques. For me, it was a mixture of both. When the nerves take control, i switch my play and miss every shot etc. <br>  <br>  You might have the same case, if not, then i might be able to help you out. Be consistent, remember that. Also the style of your play might require a few adjustments. When your trying to hit a topspin shot, make sure your grip is a full western grip. Stay active on court as well. That will boost up your play. Make sure you go for shots, don't hesitate. Play it safe for the meantime.|`|Ac6t7A24aa	turn your hand/hands (depending on forehand or backhand) a centimeter or two to the right when holding your grip for forehands, and the same distance but to the left for backhands... this will automatically add topspin.<br>  <br>  (thats if you're right handed.. if your left, its the opposite)<br>  <br>  *dont twist your grip too far to the right or left though because everything will end up going into the net*|`|CS6hjZxqaa	<a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/videos/index.php/view/947/169/Introduction_to_the_Tennis_Forehand" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/videos/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/videos/index.php/view/951/183/Introduction_to_the_Tennis_Two_Handed_Backhand" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/videos/i...</a><br>  <br>  gotta sign up but it's all FREE|`|KwqZmlZRaa	I've already answers a question about the same as this, regarding playing pushers so i will paste what i said here. <br>  Yea... was going to remind you they are called pushers. Anyways I don't really agree with what the other two guys said before, trying drop shots is not smart.. its a very low percentage shot and most times you will fail and hit the net or you will give your opponent the easiest approach shot ever and will lose the point anyway. Plus if your not good at lobbing or passing shot pulling him to the net will give him easy volley winners. Basically the best thing to do is never underestimate a pusher just because they don't have impressive shots, always keep in mind that they CAN beat you. Also always remember that you WILL miss shots, just don't let it get to your head and stick to your normal strokes, play your game, not his. <br>  <br>  Pushers, of course, “push” the ball, which means that their ball has no pace. If you have solid volley and overhead skills, then your best tactic is to try to get to the net. There you have the best chance of finishing the points and keeping the pusher under constant pressure.  If they are a real pusher there passing shot skills won't be to impressive so you don't have to worry about them hitting winners on you and he will give you lots of short shots to approach to the net on. also you will keep him under constant pressure this way and will force him to hit the ball faster etc. giving more chance for him to mess up. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  need any other help i guess you could email me or something.<br>  aim- arrozdetenista<br>  email- bbalindude011@yahoo.com
1ENrDkwZaa	at 14 I would say that around 240 ish would be around right. Also, to straighten out your shots, just keep on getting those lessons. No advice on the internet from people who haven;t even seen your swing can even compare to what a good lesson can do for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, to brendan d, and blol, that sounds like total bull that a 16 year old would hit it 320 yards, especially at 115 lbs|`|sRQQhGX5aa	When i was 14 i was only hitting my driver like 220, but in the last year (now im 15) i have probably gained 50 yards. Im 5'8 145 and usually hit my driver 265-275. And the 16 year old that said he has hit it 300 yards is not lying. My long drive is 330 (I hit some hard dirt and it rolled about 60 yards).<br>  So in the next year don't be surprised if you gain 50 yards off the tee.|`|eENOmz5Laa	perfet your form, and practice|`|uOAFLBpXaa	Im 16, 115 and I average 250-260 with my longest at 320 but I hit it LONG for my size|`|x3j8Axfhaa	make sure your form is perfect, follow through, and make sure your foot turns on the toe, and practice makes perfect|`|YGhxhhm6aa	make sure u have perfect form!

250721c3e6953ac874da79dedd0e8ae9aa	I would take Duncan, LeBron, and D-Williams for these reasons:<br>  <br>  I'd draft Duncan over KG not because he is much better skillwise but I think Duncan still gives you the necessary stats and he satisfies you in certain categories all season long...! Boston uses more of a team effort and their system requires the players such as the big three to sacrifice their stats for the sake of team... whereas spurs rely on Duncan's rebounding and scoring heavily night in and night out...! I chose LeBron cause he would be your triple-double man and Cavs depend on him to perform at that level every single game... he is the scoring champ and averages 30,7,7 even if he turns it over once in a while....! The last one is a hard choice and at this point I would go with D-Will. He caught fire toward the end of the season and almost gets you the same number of assists and points however Nash has been constantly commiting turnovers and Williams still get you more rebounds as a guard!|`|2kBoRwcKaa	KG/ Duncan tossup...

It wouldn't really establish anything. Especially considering that a turn by Michaels on Cena was slowly built for the biggest ppv of 2007. W/ Cena and Batista, such a storyline isn't really necessary. All they're trying to build up is a match between two supposed top faces who've never met one on one in WWE, well except for Royal Rumble 2005 at the end of the match.

4pLEDSejaa	It's a chore to train a beagle by yourself when you don't know what you're doing. <br>  <br>  You'll have to get him excited about rabbits. When it's a pup, you'll want to put a rabbit (preferable a wild cottontail) and the dog in a confined area together. Maybe your unfinished basement or make a large chicken wire pen. In short order, the pup should be interested in chasing the rabbit. <br>  <br>  You can take him outside, put rabbit scent on a rag, and drag it around and have him follow it too. <br>  <br>  As the pup gets older, you can try to find some land where you guys can run rabbits this summer/fall (check state regs for training but it's usually not a problem)<br>  <br>  Then you're going to have to train it not to run coyote or deer. If they like chasing deer, you might as well take him straight to the pound or sell it. <br>  Take some scent on a rag and drag it in the yard. <br>  As soon as the dog crosses that path and smells it --- you pop him so hard he's dizzy for a week !!! I wouldn't use your hands though as you don't want him to fear you.  Whack him with rolled up newspaper or something.<br>  You keep on doing that until he ignores the smell or puts his tail between his legs. A buddy of mine one time took a fresh deer hide and dog into the local laundry mat --- tossed the both of them in a commercial dryer and let it spin around for a while. Probably be a good way to get thrown out though. <br>  A deer hide, barrel, and hill will work just as good.<br>  Just be sure to praise him when he crosses a rabbit scent/drag trail again. You don't want him afraid of rabbits<br>  <br>  Now you have to make sure he's not gun shy. Fire some 22lf or blanks if your property allows for it. If not try to take him to some public ground where you can do it. If you must take him to a shooting range, I'd park pretty far away and just let him get used to everyone's racket. Gradually you'll want to introduce a shotgun maybe 50 yards or so away. Many dogs are gunshy and love to run rabbits though. <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course nothing beats having the dog run with other dogs and I'd certainly recomend trying to find a friend, people on chat forums, etc that might be willing to go out with you. <br>  <br>  You should really try to find a professional (I use that term loosely) who either trains your dog or sells trained dogs. Ask him a bunch of questions - how long would you have to keep the dog there, what age should it be, pre-training requirements, how he disciplines them (many abuse dogs), how close the bloodline is (inbreeding is often a big problem with dogs being born with 3 ears and all kinds of weird stuff), etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Start taking them into the field when they are Five (5*) months old.* The more you take them out the quicker the results will be.* You don't have to do anything but get them out there in the field in order to train them.* They have a natural instinct to hunt rabbits.* All you need to do is take them out so they can hunt them and chase them.* They already know what to do, you don't really need to train them at all, just get them out there in the field.* E-mail me for more tips on how to train and hunt with them.*|`|DfjgjP6kaa	I'm not a dog expert but right now i am training a pup and it seems you need a lot of pacience.

All you really need to know is how to go through the wind up. Once you learn at your age just to go through the mechanics it basically becomes just throwing over the plate. Now once you get older though that's when you begin actually pitching and throwing Fastballs harder, and changes and curve and aiming pitches. But right now just learn the mechanics and throw at a comfortable speed over the plate and you will succeed.|`|yererDcnaa	id say <br>  <br>  THROW STRIKES. make them put the ball in play and rely on your defense|`|AHQX3EYHaa	i learned how to pitch from baseball-mechanics.devhub.com<br>  it gave me tips on how to play better. it also told me avaible batting cages and lessons. it is now my favorite website. you should try it|`|OlwAjqWsaa	I have played baseball for 14 years and pitched 8 of them.

HehPyjAMaa	No you can keep the same barrel, that's the point of getting a conversion unit, you just swap out the bolt carrier.<br>  <br>  Like what was said above, your rifling twist is probably too fast to give optimal stabilization of the .22 bullet, but it won't matter much if you are shooting at 50 yards or less.<br>  <br>  Since your rifle has a gas tube, after shooting a lot of .22 it might get clogged with lead. To deal with it is simple, just swap out the .22 adapter and shoot a few rounds of .223/5.56 when you are done. It will blast out any lead residue that's loose. Then use a good solvent to clean the rest of the gun.|`|Pp3WHtSFaa	as mentioned above it is true you can use the same barrel and it is true the bullet will stabilize fine out to 50yds or so but I highly recommend you clean your barrel before you shoot .223/5.56mm through it again as the 22lr bullets are made out of lead which will cause some lead build up in the bbl and when you shoot the high velocity .223/5.56mm through it you can get some serious fouling/scorching which will ruin your bbl. <br>  <br>  Use a bore snake with some CLP on it and run it through your bbl about 2 or 3 times before you go to shoot .223 through it again.<br>  <br>  Remember all you have to do is pull the rear pin, leave the front pin in and tilt the upper away from the lower, pull the BCG out and now bore snake. It only takes a sec and will save your accuracy/barrel life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

It's going to be Kobe or LeBron. <br>  <br>  I absolutely despise the logic of picking MVP. Kobe won it last year because he "led his team to first place in the tough western conference." How about CP3 dragging a team full of average players to second place in that hyper competitive conference? But nope, it's Kobe. Despite the Lakers turning point of the season was getting Gasol. <br>  <br>  The same snub is going to happen to Wade. He's going to drag his team full of scrubs to a respectable seed, yet it's going to go to someone who's led their team to the most wins. Good god. Going by that logic, if Kobe was on a team with a whole load of great role players. He would get MVP because he's the best player on the team with the most wins.<br>  <br>  That's retarded.|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Carmelo is right.

Z8UV6S3baa	Well, the .357 SIG is an interesting round, 25% faster than an equivalent weight 9mm giving you 50% more Kinetic Energy. Not quite as hard shooting as a 40 S&W, but not quite as soft as a 9.<br>  <br>  I think that fundamentally it simply suffers from a couple of things:<br>  <br>  1) As a tweener cartridge (like the 40 S&W once was and is still considered so by some) it will be difficult for it to gain acceptance until some agency, substantial police group or well known SWAT team decides to adopt it. The 40 didn't really get adoption until it started getting used by cops.<br>  <br>  2) Until practice ammo is really cheap enough for people to go to the range and do some shooting with it, it will be hard to accept.<br>  <br>  3) There aren't really any competitive shooters using it. Competitive shooters aren't that many, but they go through alot of ammo and develop loads for alot of ammo. Thus the "9 major" chamberings and such which is almost to the level of being offered as prepackaged ammo by factories.<br>  <br>  4) The overwhelming over importance placed on specific caliber as a defense cartridge. 45 vs. 9 vs. 40, .380 being too small, but 9 Makarov not being so, 147 grain 9 mm vs. 165 grain .45ACP. Endless debates happen around the so called importance of cartridge and stopping power. This loyalty to a caliber also inhibits the introduction of new and potentially useful cartdriges to acceptance.<br>  <br>  So, if you like it, and shoot it well in your gun, then go ahead and use it, don't worry about what anyone else thinks.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|8MUj24s6aa	I do not like the recoil in the .357 sig or the 40sw....Tride and True .45acp|`|6f632b3efccb35d4ed39a16093f7a404aa	I also love the .357sig for the same reasons you mentioned.  More power + more stopping power than 9mm.  Longer range and accuracy than the .40s&w.  <br>  <br>  However, although I have shot .357sig, I do not own one.  No one can deny the high price of this ammunition.  Plus, the odds overwhelmingly show that should someone need to use his/her gun in self defense, the intended target will be within 7 yards, if not just 4 or 5 feet away.  At this range, the stopping power of a .40s&w or .45 is better to have than a .357sig.<br>  <br>  On top of that, I am not going to carry a caliber that I cannot afford to practice with.  I will not practice with a 9mm due to its lower costs, and then chance it with an unfamiliar .357sig when my life is on the line.|`|GHD8JicSaa	Rare...may be common where you are but try to find it in Podunk, Montana.<br>  <br>  Expensive.   You can pick up military surplus 9 mm for 15 cents a round.   Can you find Sig 357 for less than 75 cents a round?<br>  <br>  Re-inventing the wheel.   It has no big advantage over any other round.  <br>  <br>  Personally,  I like the 45 ACP which beats the crap out of both the 40 and the Sig 357.|`|GDJGNYFcaa	It's in the same boat as the .204, 17 Rem, and .221 fireball. It's not what most people would consider a standard round, and don't see any advantage over those standard rounds for the price. People ask me all the time why I don't just get a 22-250.|`|TvARYVRJaa	ITS A AS/ KICKER LITTLE ROUND  $$$$$$$$$,, I LIKE UM  ok thanks|`|yqx9YTBJaa	There's nothing inherently wrong with the .357 Sig, aka "9mm Magnum".  It's just that not being one of the "big 3" calibers, you're paying a huge premium for the niche cartridge.<br>  <br>  Why not go with the 10mm?  That's 150% of the energy of the .357 Sig / .40 / .45.  It's a .40 bullet, so bigger and heavier than the .357, but also going a lot faster.<br>  <br>  If you really like the necked-down cartridge, then go with the .357 Sigs bigger brother:  the 9x25 Dillon!  That's a 10mm (".40 Magnum") necked down to a 9mm.  You're not getting much more velocity than that without going to a very hot magnum revolver or a carbine.|`|oX2KsnOQaa	people just jump on the ban wagon<br>  and don't even know what they are talking about<br>  and some are just full of you know what
OX5l3KfPaa	Most of the people i play with wear there's underneath. The only downside to wearing pads is that it harder to tell if your hit or not. So if you think you may have been hit but cant see anything make sure and ask the ref for a paint check.|`|0wHeVJ50aa	They usually wear them under their clothes. The only thing I usually use is just a mask. I also just wear a hoodie under my jersey.|`|SIz9Q8Ryaa	you would wear them under your pants and jersey. most players will wear knee pads and elbow/forearm pads to help absorb the impact of hitting the ground when diving. ALL players wear mask, no questions asked. some female players wear a chest protector to help absorb the impact of the paintball hitting their breast but i'm not a female so i dont know why but thats what i heard from one female player and i didnt want to get into details. some players also wear gloves which serve multiple roles such as: better grip, reduces "burns" on hands when diving, absorb some impact of the paintball hitting the knuckle. Most pants come with some knee padding, crotch padding, and butt padding and most jerseys have shoulder padding abd elbow/forearm padding.<br>  <br>  when i play, i will normally wear my dye invision mask with a beanie(gives the mask a better grip since i have almost no hair for the mask to grip to), dye c6 pant, dye c6 jersey, t-shirt, and sometimes underarmor depending on the temp and a pair of nike trail running shoes.|`|dMusokHwaa	people normally just wear a chest protector and a helmet. thats pretty much all you need for paintball.

He's as close to "unstoppable" as any receiver I've seen in years.<br>  <br>  As a football fan, I hope Marshall can keep his life off the field under control long enough to make a long-term impact in the NFL on the field because he's really fun to watch.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I think Wayne and Fitzgerald are the 2 best WR in the NFL.  I guess my answer is Wayne.  I watched Wayne play against, I think it was Denver last year......they just could not stop the guy. It was a Sunday night game. I think he caught 13 balls or something. Also, Wayne has been doing it for years.  Give marshall time and maybe he will be in that company also|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	Brandon Marshall is the better receiver right now. What separates him from the rest of the leagues receivers is his yards after catch. He just does not go down when he catches the ball, but he makes tacklers miss him and carries or runs over defenders to fight for extra yardage. He took a verbal thrashing for fumbling last week, but sometimes that happens when your fighting for extra yards like he does.|`|fJd2J19faa	Wayne is a consistent proven commodity. Marshall will need more than this year to surpass him.|`|27A8TvXuaa	reggie, marshall doesnt have much YAC ability<br>  <br>  where as reggie can do anything|`|GlATzQFXaa	Probably Marshall. They both have really good quarterbacks throwing them the ball right now so that helps. |`|TbO83l3yaa	marshal of course. and why are people saying Brandon Marshal cant get YAC, he is probably the best in the league at getting extra yards. he is also definetely hard to bring down.|`|ABm098h6aa	Reggie Wayne. He is probably the best receiver in the NFL right now. |`|ifkbtsIhaa	I would say reggie wayne im sorry but a reciever who cant carry the ball is worthless |`|mNlc9cf6aa	I say Reggie Wayne

x7NtYD8Aaa	People may die in this game. I feel sorry for these people. But you take that risk when you play hockey. That's just how much of a physical game it is. But it would be SUCH bs if fighting was banned.|`|9NCGmJbSaa	It is pure BS.<br>  <br>  The NHL always debates whether they should change things but they never actually take things completely out.<br>  <br>  Fighting in hockey is traditional<br>  <br>  Remember during the lockout they contemplated changing the nets?<br>  I provided a picture below<br>  <br>  That never happened because it is changing the game too much.<br>  <br>  The NHL can take out lines, make changes to the way calls are enforced or made, move lines or nets but they can't change the basics of the game. Fighting is a basic that will never change.|`|hMo9z0TSaa	I just watched the Video, I dont think they are banning it...Just trying to make better rules. It didnt say anything about banning it...I think are talking about it because they said that in the OHL the Fighting has gone up..and a 21 year old of somewere around there died during a fight. But ive noticed theres not alot of fights anymore...Im watchin the Kings game and there was a fight in the first period. So there not banning it. But yea...I do think it is BS!!

It's part of the game.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I don't believe they have said anything about banning fighting (which is extremely unlikely), merely adjusting the rules where fighting is concerned.|`|AA12172407	Many articles lately have been placing this topic on the media...that the media created it...that most GMs and players do not even discuss it.|`|SfTWwm97aa	Wont happen.|`|Z34brpZqaa	The NHL would NEVER get rid of fighting. They've made steps to get rid of unnecessary fights that are intended only to injure i.e. the fine for an instigator penalty in the last 5 minutes of a game. Nobody wants to see players get hurt, unless it's Scott Blomez or Avery, someone could take their heads off and the NHL would be better for it. The fact that more and more players wear visors is an issue that is being discussed and should be, but fighting is something that the NHL would never honestly think about banning and if you think they would, you're an idiot.<br>  <br>  P.S. Guy who said there's less fights, you're dumb. Fighting is on the rise since the lockout.|`|ULw1777caa	They won't ban it.

SkN2NqpGaa	Well, first of all, "Jim S" seems full of anger, so you should be leery of his advice. If it sends an "arrow" like a bow, then it's a bow. Second, neither is "better" than the other -- they are designed for optimum efficiency in different situations.<br>  <br>  Crossbows are fast, both to load and to shoot. They are easy to aim, compared to most hand-held bows. The archer doesn't have to hold any draw weight at all while aiming. They can be used with only one hand. Regardless what anyone says, they can be used in heavy brush, and when designed properly, for long (60-100 yards) distances; properly designed and built bolts (the "arrows") really do pack a wallop. They also tend to make more noise than other bows, too.<br>  <br>  Compounds are easy to use, even for a beginner -- the archer does not have to hold the entire amount of draw weight while at full draw. They usually require the use of two hands, though. But they are legal for hunting in every state in the U.S., unlike crossbows; you also don't have to be legally disabled to be able to hunt with a compound (just brain-dead - *hee hee*, I use a longbow :-D ).<br>  <br>  Where I live, crossbows are legal for hunting, but only for those who are legally disabled (like my Uncle - but he won''t use one, he would rather fall over while trying to use that compound).<br>  <br>  You need to check the laws where you live, before even deciding what kind of bow to get.|`|TRnp3H3daa	I'm not sure, but you should check out the compound bow deals at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.priceslisted.com/CompoundBows" rel="nofollow">http://www.priceslisted.com/CompoundBows</a>|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Neither one of those.* Get a Re-curve Bow.*  A 45Lb Bow is ideal for hunting.*|`|5pejaYlAaa	Things to remember in making your decision are the crossbow is fast, the bolt travels at a very high rate, a good crossbow will toss a bolt at 380 fps + so you have to say its better for hunting, well it dont work that way, the bolt is very light and short and beyond 25-30 yards its about useless on deer, very little pennitration, also a crossbow is terrably clumsy to carry in the woods, more then you can imagine, the upside of the crossbow is anyone can pick it up and hit well with it, less verriables then a bow, one size fits all.  We call the guys around here that hunt with crossbows cheaters, they are too lazy to hunt with a compound bow because they dont want to practice so they go to a doctor, get a made up excuse and hunt with a crossbow, we have little respect in them as bowhunters.|`|GDJGNYFcaa	Are you handicapped or in some way unable to use a compound bow? Will your MD back you? Many states prohibit the use of a crossbow unless you have been proven to be unable to use a compound bow or are of a certain age. Check local laws.
ZFTkBTvvaa	lakers,<br>  <br>  <br>  kobe, that is all.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Pick a team that will make the game harder.

All of the Magic (-D12, but he's amazing) can score from anywhere, so you will dominate every shot you make, I would know, I've had it happen to me. Also, the Spurs have a bunch of good shooters and scorers. Really, because most players can score really close inside, and most point guards can steal really well, and most centers can block pretty well, the only strategic way to do it is to make sure all your shots go in, by picking a really good shooting team (ie PF- R. Lewis SF- H. Turkoglu is a good combo, and Nelson, and Pietrus aren't bad either)|`|gprdq8E2aa	I'd go for Miami they have a good centre, young PF and Pg who get good in 1 season, one of the best SG's and alot of salary cap space, they also have a few SF who get good in no time.|`|wVvfFgX5aa	Rockets because they have Yao, T mac and Ron Artest and Yao can play inside, while tracy and ron can shoot the threes. This will allow you to go inside and outside, plus great back up players.|`|AHd9Y6AUaa	LAKERS, you got gasol, kobe, odom and bynum in there|`|bUTlzjk1aa	lakers
sCCUesFWaa	I think both players got bum raps. They didn't have teams built around their skill sets. Look at Manning when he came in the league they went with his strengths to make him the player he is today. The teams they went to Lions-Harrington, and Couch- Browns they were basically trying to find themselves. To some extint they have not been able to recapture any respect in the league. My vote for the worst would have to go to Couch and that is because of injuries he sustained with an inadequate line.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Couch was a bigger bust. Atleast harrington is still in the league.|`|ltqUpAKhaa	Couch was a victim of injuries, which is unfortunate, but part of the game. Although, he did take a team to the playoffs. Also, he was a victim of coach favoritism when he was benched for kelly holcomb.  Harrington, however, has had numerous starting opportunites (Lions, Falcons) and was terrible in both. So, it has to be Harrington|`|ABoo1doVaa	Both of them get a bad rap. Harrington played on a crappy team, and couch played on a crappy team and was injured. Couch did get an expansion team to the playoffs in his second year, so there is something to be said for that.|`|gBfPkdroaa	ryan leaf is THEE bust.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Couch, Leaf, Marinovich - All Bus'|`|IOpOEMnQaa	Joey if u watched him in detroit u'd see that when he "had his moments" that was just a receiver making a great play or a corner blowing coverage|`|PKWahZoKaa	Tim Couch by far! I don't think people can blame Joey Harrington for how bad the Lions were (are). People are always pushing all the blame on the QBs. When in relality it's the whole team/ coach.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Couch by far.

kuYsbZ9kaa	see it really depends on who else each team has on their team already. But just from looking at these three players i would say team A has the edge.  Team A Gets a top 15 pitcher and 2 top 10 Outfielders, while team B does get arguably the best player in the league Max Sherzer is still too young to make a huge impact and Nady is playing in a crowded Yankee outfield.<br>  <br>  I say Team A.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	team A for sure. burnett lots of wins, manny and carlos lots of homers, but make sure you have some speed on your team since you're giving up hanley.<br>  <br>  On a side note, want to join a another fantasy baseball league.

dpSr0icwaa	check out <a href="http://www.calguns.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.calguns.org/</a><br>  <br>  Here's the rundown in basics.  California lists both specific makes&models, plus has a list of 'naughty' features of which you can only have one.<br>  <br>  Step #1 is to get an AR-15 lower receiver made by a small obscure company.  These are refered to as 'off list' lowers, because California only listed the most common AR-15 makers (colt, bushmaster, DPMS, Rock River, etc)<br>  <br>  You then must get a barrel with no muzzle break.  You now face a tough choice...either alter the magazine well so it is not functional and perminantly holds a single fixed 10 shot magazine,  or do something to remove the pistol grip from the stock.<br>  <br>  Obviously part of the appeal of the AR-15 is the 20 or 30 round mags you can slap in with ease so most people decide to alter the pistol grip somehow.<br>  <br>  Only once you satisfy the 'naughty list' of features can you attach the lower reciever to the upper recever.<br>  <br>  Note, here are two methods for making your pistol grip not a pistol grip<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.monstermangrip.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monstermangrip.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.californiarifles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.californiarifles.com/</a>|`|JXMVNEQoaa	Sorry your state is controlled by a bunch of left wing nut jobs.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Sucks to live in Kalifornia.

Pp3WHtSFaa	The treat is intended to get their attention initialy, not to be a long term solution. Start praising them instead of treating them about 50% of the time until you get down to only praising them. If you do give them a treat 100% of the time they will start training you to give them treats and the concepts you are shooting for will never register. A good dog only wants their owner's affection and/or praise.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, but its not necessary.* Try showing your appreciation by verbalizing and petting the dog instead of treats.*|`|l8Qh5zJqaa	ya as long as you only give him a treat when he does what u want cause if u give them to him all the time then hell have his mind set to youll give them to him all the time and then when u dont ha might get angry
GWoW1o5oaa	The only thing you need to know about the hardware is the length.  It has to  be long enough to go through the deck, risers if you use them and trucks.  Brand doesn't matter.  Spacers aren't needed because the wheels have built in stops.  Speed rings (washers) should come with the trucks.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend using 1/2" shock pads to lessen wheel bite and reduce road vibration.  Get a skate tool.  Any one will do.  You might need some grip tape for the deck if it doesn't come with grip.  You will need 2 sheets for a longboard.

They've won more championships than any other team, if you count the pre-Super Bowl era.  Stadium?  What stadium has more history than Lambeau?  The legendary Ice Bowl, its historic.  The SB trophy is named after their former coach, one of the greatest of all time.  There are many things that point to them.|`|jLnXuam7aa	Niners|`|AA10248312	Up through the 90s I'd say the Cowboys.  Great teams in the 60s.  Great, great teams in the 70s.  Great in the 80s.  Great in the 90s.  <br>  <br>  But the Steelers have passed them during this decade.  Not just in Super Bowls won, but in tradition.  And Steeler fans have always been better than Cowboy fans.<br>  <br>  Steelers all the way, even though they weren't any good prior to the 70s.  Even when they weren't good, though, they played hard, and their opponents usually were pretty beat up, even though they won.<br>  <br>  Green Bay would be second, especially the fans.|`|gBfPkdroaa	hmm<br>  heres my top 3<br>  <br>  1-Packers, very 1st superbowl.<br>  2nd-Steelers, 6 sb's and the terrible towels (maybe pitts. is 1st)<br>  3rd-the 49ers, Joe montana, and steve young man.,|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Coming from a Bear's fan, although Packers fans can get annoying, they have so much history in Lambeau Field.|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	DALLAS COWBOYS!!!

Yes all of the are good teams, but does anyone remember how much of a laughing stock the Patriots were or that the Cowboys weren't a team till the 60's and the Steelers weren't a team till the 30's.  <br>  <br>  There are few teams with as much history as the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers.  Packers have some of the best fans as well (and I'm a Bears fan).  These two tams have been around since the very beginning.  The Packers have 12 championships and the Bears have 9 championships, it doesn't get much better then these 2 teams when it comes to history and tradition.  Even though I'm a Bears fan I would rank the Packers 1st and the Bears 2nd.|`|paIUgtLRaa	For tradition:<br>  <br>  Either Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers. My pick: Green Bay.<br>  <br>  For fans:<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh Steelers. Everyone knows that they travel extremely well, there is a Steelers' bar in nearly every city, and the Steelers have one of the longest consecutive home sellout streaks in the league. Plus no other team, seems to connect with their fans, the way Pittsburgh's does. Only exception is the Green Bay Packers. Their situation is different. The fans actually own the team. They don't go to the games, and they are slitting their own financial throats.<br>  <br>  Only 2 teams can say that they were there from the beginning: Chicago and Arizona. Both were there in 1920. Only 3 teams can say they were there before the NFL was named the NFL: Chicago, Arizona, and Green Bay. Being around simply doesn't make you great in the tradition (just ask the Cards), but having the most championships doesn't either automatically. Tradition is about having great stories too. All things considered, Cowboys aren't even close, and the tops are Green Bay, Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York Giants, San Francisco, St. Louis, Cleveland, and maybe, just maybe Dallas. Yeah, most of those are old teams, but you have to have a history to have tradition. I highly doubt the Texans have tradition, yet.|`|IOpOEMnQaa	fans-Eagles, Raiders, Stealers, and Lions (look at what we have to endure here in Michigan and most of us are still loyal)<br>  Tradition-Steelers, Colts, Packers, and Bears|`|QtoDx4Vtaa	Thinking about history and such, I would pick either the Green Bay Packers, the Chicago Bears, or the Dallas Cowboys.|`|neAarrjKaa	if your talking about football it has to be <br>  #1-steelers-most superbowls<br>  #2 tie between cowboys and 49ers|`|ZXxgz4Xtaa	Cleveland Browns|`|ILW3vkhEaa	Dallas Cowboys|`|YMv771YBaa	ok this is a no brainer, this honor hands down goes to the steelers. they have an nfl record 6th superbowl, they have the best fans in the NFL, you can go to any major city in the country and find a steelers bar, you cant find that with any other team, we have the biggest fan base not just in the country but in the world, arguably one of the best franchises in all of sports, move over cowgirls you are no longer americas team|`|3bd3d6c24c39616e8221985f212c2c13aa	i am a cowboys fan and as a far as historical wise i think youd have to put the <br>  <br>  packers and bears first. they had many more championships than anybody.<br>  <br>  the steelers have recently earned a tie with their 6th sb<br>  <br>  then cowboys and 49ers<br>  <br>  patriots would be 4th place since they were not very good until 2000.<br>  <br>  But if youre a steelers fan looking for the post sb excitement then yes  the steelers sb wise are the best team.<br>  Although i still think hines ward and harrison are dirty players.|`|QuduR6kdaa	If anyone says the Cowboys, they should be placed in an insane asylum.<br>  <br>  If anyone says the Giants, they should wake up and realize that Eli sucks.<br>  <br>  If anyone says the Raiders, they should stop living in the 70's.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think the Packers take the cake. Lambeau Field places them in a very special ranking.

paIUgtLRaa	This again....<br>  <br>  <br>  This was how many years ago.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Pul-leaze, would somebody get over this already....<br>  <br>  <br>  If the refs leaned to the Pittsburgh side, then that's probably cause the Seahawks were playing dirty more. They were scared. Everyone in the media and press knew that even when the playoffs had just started, that they predicted that any team in the AFC would have beaten any team of the NFC. It didn't matter who it was, in any combination. Of course no one remembers this. But Pittsburgh plowing through the playoffs, even they nearly got screwed out of their win in Indy (no one brings this up either), Pittsburgh earned their way into the Super Bowl. Seattle, playing in a weaker conference, never having played anyone in a meaningful game that mattered with a quality team (don't count the Panthers or Redskins, after all they were apart of the weak NFC) were unable to match the Pittsburgh fury. They knew that they couldn't step up toe to toe and match the intensity. They leaned upon the misfires by Ben and the hope that the refs wouldn't catch them breaking the rules.<br>  <br>  If the refs truely had a favorite, it would have been the Seahawks. 1. They didn't want Pittsburgh to get the fifth ring. 2. It would have been precious to allow Holmgren to become the first coach to win a Super Bowl with 2 different teams. 3. If it was up to anyone, Pittsburgh wouldn't have even been there to compete in the first place. If anyone had tried anything, it would have been the Pittsburgh-Indianapolis game, when they apparantly wanted the Colts to win. How in the hell do you overturn an interception like that?<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh was favored by the refs? Sheesh. The game was 3 years ago. Let's move on.|`|ULw1777caa	LOL, really?  4 years later and someone is still crying about it?  The Steelers won because they were a better team.  The Seahawks lost cause they have a crappy QB.  Let it go, you can't change the past.|`|7RziqsDcaa	No.|`|yikZNA7aaa	The refs always affect a game no matter what, and yes they did definitely favor the steelers in that game, but in the end the steelers made more plays. period. As much as I'd like to blame the refs, no they didn't decide the game, they may have influenced it, but the steelers won it.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	There were a lot of questionable calls in this game.While the human element is at play here.I am surprised that the FBI did not investigate this!There is a lot of legal money bet on this game and it should have been looked at.|`|vnzSTerjaa	as much as i hate the steelers... what happened happened, and if the referees were favoring the steelers, there would have been consequences for them.|`|NiMluxNDaa	isnt it obvious?<br>  the refs and there calls,<br>  its all bullshit|`|hM3WwASaaa	Your right they did seem to favor the Steeler. And about a week later on NFL total aAccess the president for the ref assc.said that certain calls should have went the other way and were totally bogus.

McCaw<br>  2     S. Burger<br>  3     G. Smith<br>  <br>  Now I'm a South African putting McCaw above Burger... Burger is a rock on defense and has the ability to change a game by making some huge plays (tackles, turnovers) but he's a little ill-disciplined.<br>  <br>  McCaw is brilliant in every match he plays - South Africans hate how good he is. And he's a dam good captain! Bastard! haha.<br>   <br>  George Smith is also unbelievable... When opposition players go to ground they better have support players nearby or George Smith will be there to grab it. He (like Schalk Burger) has an engine that never dies. And he's surprisingly quick around the field.<br>  <br>  Chabal, Spies and Collins are all big strong men who carry the ball dangerously! But in my opinion neither of them perform the role of flank as well as the 3 I mentioned. Don't forget a flank's most important roles are to be solid on defense, secure possession and put pressure on opposition ball.|`|7FSQvDOlaa	Richie McCaw is the best flanker at seven, Shalk Burger at six as Collins was always over-rated in my opinion. Second best pairing in the world would be George Smith with Rocky Elsom. As for no. 8, I dont see anyone who adds as much to a team as So'oialo. Also no-one has mentioned South Africa's best 7 in my opinion, Luke Watson, who cant get a fair start for political reasons ( his dad upset some big names in rugby in SA).|`|FsiOXWYLaa	I know u don't care about no: but they r very very important. they all play an extremely different role.<br>  However yes jerry collins is a good ball runner and is best suited to no 8. His rucking abilities are average. He makes a reasonable back up line out jumper as well but in his later stages of career his fitness is starting to lack.   George smith is the 2nd best no 7 in the world only richie macaw. Richie is not only the best flanker but close to being the best player in the world. He is the most complete forward in skill. And that pains me to say as i'm a wallabies supporter.   Pier is a shocking player. He can run the ball well but he has horrible handling disgusting discipline. cannot ruck at all he is the worst inclusion in the spring Box  pack. there are many better players in sth africa.

Peterson is getting a lot of hype, but the most recent news I saw is that he will start the season as the change-of-pace back, and Taylor will be the primary back for now.  If Portis gets back to form, of course he vaults up a few spots.  Jacobs is apparently going to be the number one back in NY, but he is a big man and I wonder if he will wear down as the season (or even a single game) goes on, as he has not been a guy who carries the ball 20+ times a game so far in his career.|`|mWy4VctBaa	clinton portis<br>  travis henry<br>  marshawn lynch<br>  adrian peterson<br>  tatum bell <br>  brandon jacobs<br>  julious jones<br>  jamal lewis<br>  warrick dunn<br>  m barber 3<br>  thomas jones<br>  cedric benson<br>  ahman green <br>  chester taylor|`|n5oG6Wdfaa	Travis Henry-best o-line hard to not go with him<br>  Cedric Benson-i think he will get the ball more than wat Grossman will get becuz he will fumble less than grossman<br>  Chester Taylor and AP- with a RB duo like that how cant they be good<br>  Clinton Portis-he should have a combak season<br>  Marshawn Lynch-hes a rookie and the bills say they like him alot aslo they got a better oline this offseason<br>  Thomas Jones- he should be a big part of the Jets offense <br>  M Barber- sure he gets alot of TDs but not to many yds <br>  J Jones- not to many TDs but yds and carries<br>  Brandon Jacobs-hes going to be the running monster for NYG<br>  Tatum Bell-sure hes not the starter but he has the same running style M Faulk had wen he ran the ball for Mike Martz O system<br>  Ahman Green-not a bad RB but bad o-line<br>  J Lewis- same as Green<br>  Brandon Jackson- well hes a rookie and not first round pick<br>  Warrick Dunn- this should be more of Jerious Norwood and Norwood could be behind Thomas jones|`|mgtZGbqTaa	For me it goes like this:<br>  <br>  1.

They've yet to do it for me...so seeing tributes to the 94 Rangers is very special to me.<br>  <br>  But for the Yankees its different. They've won 26 World Series so its hard to do a tribute for just one. I get emotional watching classic games on the YES Network. Like Games 4 and 5 of the 2001 World Series, because of 9/11 and how dramatic the games were and when everybody sang New York, New York in a rousing chorus at the end of both and the Paul O'Neil chant, etc, etc. That gets me emotional.|`|b472ce8f4f191c7447450dcf2d1cf2d1aa	I cry when I see tributes to Kirby Puckett.

73005772047668391bb3ee6a5ceba354aa	I think this is a good trade for what you wanted to accomplish. It's not as horrible as everyone is saying it is. Figgins for Oswalt is in favor of Figgins...everyone has Figgins in the top 50, Oswalt normally is a top 80. Figgins was hurt in the month of April and didn't play at all (442 ABs), yet still made the 100 (88th in yahoo ranks for last season which doesn't take ABs into it). Last year he was a stud in 2 categories (steals and ave), good in runs, and for once, he didn't really hurt you on RBIs (on pace for 79).<br>  <br>  Chamberlain is a question mark as we don't know the yankees plans. He could spend the whole year as the setup man, I've read rumors about him going to the minors half way through the season, etc...the point is that Chamberlain might turn out to be the stud most expected, but it's no garentee. Neshek will produce similar stats to Chamberlain without the questions attached (but less upside if Chamberlain would become a starter). Giving up Pedroia as well makes this trade in your opponents favor, however, sometimes in order to get the guys you want and need (Figgins), sacrifices can be made (if Pedroia is a bust and Chamberlain performs like a rookie, then you'll come out looking sharp).<br>  <br>  If nothing else, there is less risk involved with Figgins and Neshek, but also less upside.|`|410emUVNaa	i dont think that was a good move. neshek is just a set up guy for the best closer in baseball, joe nathan. chamberlain will start in the pen, but will become a starter midseason and if anyhting happens to the old rivera, he'll be the closer. pedoria is an up and comer, and should be effective in a deep BOS lineup. i wouldnt have made the move myself. also, oswalt is the ace on that staff and is liable to get 15-20 wins this year wth a much improved houston lineup. sorry man, if you can get that trade vetoed, do it|`|ckpqR8uTaa	i wouldve liked a better guy back than neshek (like a broxton) or maybe take off Chamberlain from the deal but either way its good. Pedroia has limited value where as Figgins is a top 60 fantasy guy|`|tZverr6Zaa	Im sorry about this but I don't care how good you're pitching is, Oswalt is top-tier pitcher.  Surely you have another pitcher that could have been dealt.  Figgins should have a good season around .290 and steal a lot of bases provided he gets the green light to do so.  Pedroia is an excellent upcoming 2nd baseman, but I give the edge to Figgins on the "total" of offense he offers.  Chamberlain should be a starter by All-Star break.  Neshek will strikeout a good deal of folks, but that is the only stat besides ERA that he offers.  I would get someone to veto this trade or you will deeply regret this decision and please keep Oswalt out of future trade offers, he's not for sale.  RR

Seeing that you can only have a certain amount of starting players, take Fitzgerald and Portis.  Fitzgerald is one of the top recievers for points in the league.

Fitz is a monster, especially w/ Boldin recovering from a concussion. With Arizona throwing 40 times a game, he's bound to produce. Portis has arguably been the MVP in fantasy this year, and is a great RB. Housmanzadeh's production is down, and is in a terrible situation in Cincinnati.

He is due to play in Week 8 and is Warner's favorite red zone target. This is a no-brainer - you have to get him. Especially, since you have a "scrub" on your roster to drop for him… DO IT. I have him on my team and wasn't thinking for a second of dropping him.You better hurry up before someone else grabs him. If he is dropped to waivers, I hope you have a high waiver number because someone else in your league is probably already thinking of grabbing him.

GL9vI200aa	adam gilchrist he's the king of cricket|`|AA11088802	still Aussies.. one lost is nothing matters|`|yeb7fyHsaa	I think that Australia used to rule the world in cricket, but now their firm grasp at that title is quickly fading away with the retirement of Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Stuart MacGill; the soon and coming retirements of Ricky Ponting, Micheal Hussey, Andrew Symonds and Matthew Hayden make me feel that in the coming times, Australia surely isn't going to be a dominant force. <br>  Same goes to India,  in the test form. Their 4 greatest batsmen: VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Saurav Ganguly, and eventually also Sachin Tendulkar, probably only have a year or two left, and also India's highest wicket taker Anil Kumble will also take leave, but his position can be easily replaced with the youthful exuberence, great spin, great line and length of Amit Mishra. <br>  So, in tests, India is greatly damaged, while australia is damaged in both ODIs and tests. <br>  But with the amount of people playing cricket in India, there will be many new players with a lot of potential that may be able to replace them.<br>  I THINK INDIA WILL DOMINATE|`|XLaiS6n0aa	the events of last year still ringing through the minds of both supporters.  Oh you mean Gilly's retirement yeah that was sad.<br>  <br>  Yeah I think the Asian bloc certainly rules cricket, maybe not in the stands but certainly in the board rooms.<br>  <br>  examples:<br>  Australia and New Zealand loosing the rights to the 2011 world cup when they where the only ones got their bid in on time and as most people said it was better than the sub continant bid.  Next thing you know the World Cup is being played on the continant.<br>  <br>  Another example was the elevation of Bangladesh to Test Match status.  India where the most vocal about this happening because they realised it would give them an extra vote on the ICC.  All they needed to do then was swing one more nation (usually the West Indies) and they get their own way.|`|TiWeUJLVaa	In terms of the players (eg winning the most matches) the answer is Australia, although they are in danger of getting bumped off their perch<br>  <br>  In terms of politics (eg the ability to hold the game at ransom) this undoubtably goes to India<br>  lets face it, what they want they always get as they bring the most revenue into cricket|`|oLwmpSPQaa	SRI LANKA.<br>  <br>  They have just beaten the Indians 2-1 .

The last two series against India has shown that Australia has come back to the pack.  In the coming years South Africa will get to number one but I see no team dominating the way Australia did for such a long stretch of time.<br>  In purely monetary terms and the influence that that brings, India clearly is the dominant force in decision making.

RyZHhI6aaa	The more training that she gets, the easier that it will be.  However, 5 weeks isn't a lot.  And you're not really "training" by taking her for walks.  When she first arrived at your barn 5 weeks ago, she was a clean slate... she didn't have a routine.  After 5 weeks, she has come to expect that she's going to be fed, put in a paddock, walked, put back into a paddock, then fed again.  On your walks, she's sort of just testing you.  It's not that she doesn't know how to behave... she's just seeing how much she can get away with and seeing if she's bad if it gets her put back in her paddock sooner.  Don't let her get away with it.  It's good that you're stopping her when she acts up, but instead of letting her run a circle, stop her immediately then make her back up a few steps.  Get a lead rope with a chain on it and put the chain over her nose so if she starts to act up you can shank her (give a good hard yank on the chain to let her know who's boss).  If she's really acting up, you can take the end of your lead rope and smack her with it to make her back up.  I realize that you're trying to be nice to her, but if she's acting up, she needs a little discipline or else she's just going to walk all over you in the future.  That creates a big problem when your 1000 pound animal doesn't respect its people.<br>  <br>  You're doing well with the grain thing.  Instead of letting her nip at you once, why don't you make her wait before she's allowed to eat her grain... like pour it in her bucket, then hold her there and pet her for a minute before you let her eat at all.  Let her know that she gets to eat on your terms, not hers.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how thin she is, but I suggest you start training her under saddle sooner rather than later.  4 years old is a little late to break a horse and the older they get, the harder it is to train them.  How much riding experience do you have?  If you're not very experienced, you really should hire a trainer to train her undersaddle.  A 4 year old filly is not only very young and unpredictible, but any untrained horse can be dangerous if you're not used to riding that sort of a horse.  Of course, if she's too thin, you'll need to wait until she gains weight before you can ride her.<br>  <br>  You sound like you try to be very kind and understanding with your filly, but don't let that mean that mean that you're passive with your horse.  If you think she's being bad, then show her that you won't tolerate it.  That doesn't mean that you have to beat her... if she tries to bite you in her stall, then make a sudden waving movement with your arms and yell at her... I promise it will scare her a little and she'll think twice before doing it again.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just keep working at it.  When she walks to fast, stop her and back her up.  If she's really strong about it, give a good hard yank on the lead rope to let her know that what she's doing is not acceptable.  Ultimately she needs to learn to respect you and that's not going to happen quickly, but it will happen over time if you keep disciplining her when she's bad and rewarding her when she's good.  The most common ways to teach a horse ground manners (how to behave when people are working with them on the ground rather than under saddle) is to use the lead rope to shank the horse and to make the horse back up when it's trying to run off.  Your body language means a lot too... don't get flustered if she's bad... stand up straight, put your shoulders back, and be assertive.  Just let her know that you won't let her get away with what she's doing.  And as with training any animal, keep working on it every day and it will get better.

AA10380060	it just depends who is available I would say take crabtree IF he is available, macklin if crabtree is gone then in the second round they should grab graham harrell trust me the guy is a steal waiting to happen, and going in the 2nd round as oppossed to the first is a huge advantage for rookie qb's not as much is expected right away out of a second rounder besides harrell just may be the best qb in the draft this year, its just the nfl hasn't learned that yet!|`|jLnXuam7aa	OT, OLB or maybe Crabtree if he is there but I dont think he will slip past 7 or 8|`|yg3Pveakaa	They need to draft an OL, their offense struggled because their line suck.

Last year O' Suckivan got sacked like more then 5 times for each game. They need to protect the qb. Speaking of qb I think they should draft Josh Freeman in the second round, and release Alex Smith.

If not him then they should make a grab for Harrell Graham.|`|gBfPkdroaa	hmm well mock drafts say we're looking at mark sanchez but thats just plain crazy.<br>  <br>  but i want 9ers to get Andre smith (but i doubt that he'll be avalible by than)since singletary wants a run 1st team, he better get a top notch tackle, and that can be smith.<br>  <br>  or maybe a WR.<br>  <br>  Isaic Bruce can teach a young WR on what to do.<br>  <br>  orrr...hmm idk, im just thinking Oline.|`|uoZIYhJtaa	The Niners need a DE or LB who can put a pass rush on a QB.<br>  <br>  Or, a game breaker WR.|`|EICpCPPQaa	The 49ers need help protecting the QB and already have competition coming into camp for the QB starting job so I believe they will end up drafting a tackle.  Possibilities are Eugene Monore of Virginia, Andre Smith of Alabama, and Jason Smith of Baylor.  This pick makes a lot more sense than drafting a QB considering the 1st pick mistake with Alex Smith, the fact that Hill played decent last year, and that Smith's contract has been restructured.<br>  <br>  There is still the possibility that we will select a QB (Matt Stafford or Mark Sanchez) but I see a tackle as more likely.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	Mark Sanchez.  They'll get a good value on a franchise QB.  Sanchez may not be able to start right away, but they need someone they can develop, and Sanchez would be a great developmental project.

He may be holding a clip board for a couple of years, but he'll be ready when the time comes.|`|F6A7FR6uaa	Everette Brown, DE, Florida State<br>  Mike Singletary's priorities are offensive tackle and defensive end.

The front derailleur would also be weird because of the cage/chain width, and you'd also have to replace the chain. The rear spacing in your frame will be wrong as well.

cAMdBtFQaa	I began learning with a short set, 3,5,7,9 irons and putter. <br>  <br>  A full set of clubs start with the 1, 3 and 5 wood, 3 through 9 irons, a wedge and a putter you are allowed a maximum of 14 clubs.<br>  <br>  No, you do not need a full set of clubs to play.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are just starting, so if you don't mind, I will tell you how I started.  With the short set I stated above, I began practicing with the 5 iron as it is the medium stance club.  Between practice and play with the 5 iron I wore through the chrome, the copper plating surface and into the base metal.  By that time I had developed some skill with the short set and bought a full set of custom clubs.<br>  Another thing I found helpful was Ben Hogan's "5 Lessons".  Believe it or not, I found this better than people I took golf lessons from.<br>  Another thing I found helpful, watch other people,  See what they do with their stance and swing and the results.  It will help you decompose your swing when things are going poorly.<br>  Old guys are probably most helpful to watch, they don't hit far, they don't have the long drive, but they control well what they do hit and come in with low scores and that is the key to a winning game, control.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it is an exasperatingly fun game.|`|zYFMhrkKaa	Taylormade r7 CGB driver<br>  for the set.I think callaway x-22 tour iron set would be better.<br>  you can have a try.|`|eENOmz5Laa	in my bag, there are:<br>  <br>  Ping G10<br>  Driver<br>  2 fairway woods<br>  2 hybrids<br>  5-9 irons<br>  pw, lw, aw, sw|`|EgiCy9mdaa	My set consists of 14 clubs. <br>  *A driver<br>  *A hybrid<br>  *Irons pw-3<br>  *Wedges 52, 56, 60 degree<br>  *putter|`|452e9e54777c912d27806864ac6f080faa	You don't need a full set. But it's usually...<br>  <br>  Driver, 3 Wood, 5 Wood, 3-9 Irons. Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and a Putter. Some people have a 2-iron, a Lob Wedge, or anything else they can hit effectively.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you have no more than 14 clubs in your bag.|`|BPDvvryraa	I have a friend that won't hit anything but the driver.

Chip shot is a choked down driver.|`|l4pVsxoraa	Depending on your skill level and how much money you want to spend you can get away with a very basic set of clubs, 5, 7, 9 irons, a putter, driver and a 3 wood would do you to start.  A full set of clubs can be any combination of different clubs as long as the total number carried by the golfer doesn't exceed 14.  A "typical" full set would be 4 through 9 iron, pitching wedge, sand wedge, putter. driver, 3 wood and 5 wood.  That adds up to13 clubs.  Some people would carry an extra wedge, others maybe a hybrid of some kind.  It's up to the golfer.|`|qlO6UZZyaa	#1  driver, a putter and the 3,5,7,9 irons. This is considered to be a basic golf club set.
gA7HuOODaa	i would have to say that the best thing to do is take some private lessons and play club during the off season.  taking private lessons is really helpful, the coach will identify the weaknesses you have with your setting and you will do drills to help you improve upon those weaknesses.  sometimes they will also give you different exercises to do at home.  one of those exercises is setting against the wall.  you should start off with short quick sets [about 100] then take a step back and try to hit a spot that is about a foot higher another hundred times. finally take one more step back and do another set that is higher than the last hundred hitting the same spot every time.  this exercises helps you to practice control and endurance because throughout the exercises you should be standing with your knees bent and your right foot forward.  camps and clinics are really helpful also. i hope you make the team next year! good luck!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	remember that being a setter means being quick and smart. you should know how and where to place the ball when the time arises, and make sure you're an effective listener and communicator. it also helps to do push ups on your fingers to strengthen them. a setter uses both wrist and arms to push the ball, but remember cushioning the ball with your wrists is a little more important. your coach will teach you about that.

Hkb7xoaQaa	Dude, if your still in high school your size is really going to work to your advantage, but getting to the next level is going to take a lot of work on the little things. The first things scouts will look at is your strength, im not sure how old you are but since you're talking about training i'll assume your in high school. Live in the weight room man, i recommend squatting heavy three to four times a week, but incorporate box squats, half squats and full squats as well as dead lifting and power cleans. As an offensive guard your legs are the key to getting the force you want on the line. Balance is also very important, do you bend at the knee and keep your hips low?, can you hold your 3-point stance for long periods of time, can you pull without having a tell?(these are the things you want to start looking at.... The best way to start improving these is to practice getting and staying in your stance when your at home and you have some free time, and focus on keeping your back flat, chin up and heels down. I think the most important thing when dealing with offensive linemen is how well you use your hips. You want them to be as fluid as possible so that you can use the leverage and strength from your legs to block defenders. I drill that we used to do was take a 2X4, put it on the field, put your hands on with and drive the wood up and down the field while focusing on keeping your hips low. So your top three lower body work outs are squats, dead lifts and power cleans, they will strengthen your core and lower body and give you the power you need to drive and pancake defenders. The last two things you need to work on are your feet and your upper body strength. Plyometrics will be your best friend when trying to pick up your foot speed. Do dot drills and jump rope a lot, this way you will off set all the hard lower body work with some speed drills to make your feet light. Jump rope and dot drills will also help you keep your feet pounding and moving, don't ever stop your feet or else you've lost the battle. Lastly, upper body strength is good for pass blocking and it helps your confidence and aggression. You won't ever really use only your upper body strength because you block inside and you seldom extend your arms but scouts and coaches like their guards to be strong, so get in the weight room and strength bench. Find out your max and talk to your strength coach about a bench program to get you stronger, you could get your bench up to 250 or 275 in a year with the right program. So remember, quick feet and lower body strength first, worry about the upper body later...|`|gBfPkdroaa	your squat is good, but you need to get stronger in that upper body.<br>  your weight is good, and so is your height.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  -know your surroundings, is the LB blizting? are the D-linemen stunting? etc.<br>  -Have quick feet, and make sure you know how to block<br>  -get low, the lower man always wins the fight down in the trenches.<br>  -listen to your coach!<br>  <br>  and other stuff.|`|f4ea933ff2710d6621207b1fad09d53aaa	good footwork, always aware of your surroundings and the going and getting good leverage when you need to. i am no trainer but i would think power snapping, working on dead lifting and more squatting and more foot work training will benefit you.|`|flzuqUJNaa	If you have the speed for it, it sounds like you would be a good fit at guard. You have great size but it takes a little more speed to play guard opposed to center or tackle.On alot of run plays like sweeps or options you will be expected to pull and kick out the d-end, trust me it takes some quickness to get there. Just keep hitting the weights and you should be fine.
DHdhdis6aa	This website says that the Comal River, which runs through Braunfels, Texas, has an average depth of 6-8 feet. Sounds like you should be okay, but I would highly reccomend swimming with friends or family (just not alone) and staying relatively close to shore.

f9hiPMDxaa	Both are very popular in their own right. Super 14 is every bit as good as league but there are only 4 Australian sides compared to 15 in the NRL comp. All team in S14 are well supported. League support is great but not the best in Melbourne. SOO is the jewel in the crown for league but rugby internationals are far better and more competitive than league internationals.|`|TICbH7draa	league is more popualr <br>  league has over 200,000 registered players while union has only about 160,000<br>  <br>  plus league is on the media (sometimes for bad reasons) far more than union.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	League.<br>  It's on TV more.<br>  Both are quite popular.|`|0Dx3pBVEaa	i think league is.<br>  STATE OF ORIGIN. better than international league.|`|F32uPjAraa	League.|`|CB4iQcI9aa	Depends, i would imagine there would be more Rugby Union clubs and players in Australia (the game is played quiet extensively at grass roots level all over) but you hear more about rugby league because it has a national club competition. <br>  <br>  Rugby League is really only in NSW & QLD. Rugby is played all over.<br>  <br>  Besides people are turning off league in droves. League will be dead in 10 years.|`|NzJC7jQxaa	League, but i prefer union :)|`|gilK0i8Maa	check out Aussie Rules football...|`|IDBasYahaa	Unfortunately, League is. But with the money in Rugby now, I'm sure it won't be long before that changes.<br>  <br>  Both types of rugby are only really played in 2 states, Qld & NSW, the rest of the country are predominately Aussie rules. However, rugby is getting 50/50 support in Western Australia now they have a super 14 team.

And they are my rivals!!!!) Usually I would completely agree with you, in fact I still do but I find myself on that bandwagon. I guess I am crowning him way too young, but he seems like a very likeable person. Nobody is forgetting your precious Johan, he is on ESPN every two seconds. NY gets a lot of praise, while yes, Oswalt is COMPLETELY underrated. Timmy is a great young pitcher, and we should see how the season plays out (remember what happened to Jeff Francis). Peace out girlscout! Lol|`|utTFiz3gaa	I like Timmy that's why :D<br>  <br>  lol nah i understand where you are coming from by no means am i calling him the best pitcher in baseball yet.. i mean he has more to prove that just one cy young season. Although that is pretty impressive stuff. Like you said more impressive pitchers out there that has been doing their stuff longer than Timmy has. I like young pitchers esp the good ones :D and ehh i like pitchers in general i've always had an affinity for the pitching side of baseball <br>  <br>  best of luck to him!<br>  <br>  p.s. Roy Halladay is my favorite pitcher in the major leagues|`|5yZICXImaa	Seriously I have liked him for a while. He is of course no where near the best pitcher in baseball and its hard to consider someone that if they haven't pitched a great deal of years yet. Roy Halladay is my favorite pitcher and easily can say that Tim has to grow up more because he quite hasn't been pitching long enough to be considered the best today,|`|yk4S7uuraa	Right now, he's the best pitcher in the NL.|`|6T90F8mNaa	-N.L. Cy Young<br>  -18 wins<br>  -265 strikeouts<br>  -24 years old<br>  -Future of the Franchise<br>  -A recent article is ESPN<br>  <br>  Why aren't people talking about Francisco Liriano as much? Maybe.....just maybe, he missed all of 2007 after his fantastic 2006 due to injury, and was in the minors most of last year still recovering. That's why we don't hear much about Liriano.<br>  <br>  Why aren't people talking about Justin Verlander as much? 4.84 ERA. 17 losses. A bad Tigers team with not much national spotlight. <br>  <br>  And do people seem to be forgetting about Johan Santana? Really? As if New York doesn't get enough media attention. <br>  <br>  And really? Is there a better pitcher currently in the NL than Tim Lincecum, the NL Cy Young winner? No. The Cy Young is awarded to the best of the best........meaning Tim Lincecum is the best of the best. And particularly impressive of him to do this on a poor Giants team. <br>  <br>  This is just my opinion...........|`|fefYXm71aa	Keep it real bro...........if he was a Met he would already have a BLVD named after him<br>  <br>  and if you keep up on BASEBALL talk (not just Met Baseball news) you would know that ALL batters that face him say his sh!t is crazy stuff<br>  <br>  Get out your Met bubble and get up-dated.<br>  <br>  Most of the hype over Timmy comes from opposing players and managers...........PEACE!!!!!!!!!!|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	It's the Mets fault.<br>  <br>  If they had a competent bullpen, Johan would have won 23 games last year and the CY Young, and people wouldn't be all over Lincecum right now.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	All I know is he better have a repeat year or I wasted a fantasy draft pick... but I agree... great pitcher, but there ARE other pitchers... just like there's other third baseman besides A-Rod.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Because he's young, fresh, and talented.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Because people want to be part of greatness, and Tim is full of that.|`|qAVADb9vaa	cuz he won a cy young. duh|`|PUrP4Axqaa	Of course you are going to call Johan Santana the best pitcher right now because you are a Met fan and if you would see the dominance that Lincecum had you would notice that he won all those games playing on the Giants they were a horrible team last year and yet Lincecum managed to win the Cy Young.<br>  <br>  Lincecum has a lot of potential and if you would watch him pitch you would see how great of a young talent he has. If Lincecum was on the Mets then you wouldn't even be saying anything you just want Santana to get all the praise and attention that Lincecum is getting because maybe you think Johan deserved the Cy Young because of his low ERA and tons of Strikeouts, but he didn't take the Mets to the Playoffs in 2008 sure Santana pitched outstanding but Lincecum did just as great and he deserves all the attention he recieves.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	If he was on the Mets right now you wouldnt have even thought of asking this question. There is no way you can ever compare him to Liriano and Verlander as both of them didnt even win or come close to a CY Award and both were on a better team than the giants. Plus Liriano got injured. I gaurantee you go ask a bunch of players around the majors about him and they will tell you how tough it is to not strikeout verse this guy. 265 k's.<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont consider him the best overall pitcher in baseball as he still needs things to work on like less pitches thrown in the game and less base on balls but I do consider him the most dominate and talented pitcher out there.<br>  <br>  Last year he was the most dominating pitcher. Name one hitter on the giants who was a threat in there lineup last year? Nobody. The giants had no offense at all yet he won 18 games and the CY Award. The crazy thing is he's not even at the top of his game.He is still developing.<br>  <br>  Look at his stats from last season, and look at what he's done this spring training. <br>  <br>  STATS DONT LIE|`|aHqrtfhUaa	Honestly, all those guys you just named are amazing pitchers... but how many of them are 5'10" 170lb flamethrowers?  Tim Lincecum is an under dog.  With his size there is no way he should be throwing 97-99.  America loves it when someone beats the odds... same as the fascination with the Rays last year.|`|OXHLqBuwaa	hey I like Tim Lincecum But i dont forget about all those other pitchers, and i understand where your coming from|`|l4mwEplsaa	This coming from a Mets fan? of course you're gonna say Johan. And all the other pitchers. You watch east coast baseball. You don't get near the exposure to these types of players as people on the west coast do. This is why everyone is writing off the yankees, rays, and red sox off as the three best teams in baseball. If you would have gotten the exposure of Tim Lincecum you would have seen the dominance in his performances. And you forgot to mention Brandon Webb or did you forget about him because he's on the west too? West coast fans have way more knowledge than anybody. Because they see the teams out here and they see the teams on the east because that's all the sports shows talk about and those are the games they show on ESPN. Tim Lincecum was dominant. He wasn't just a guy with a good year. He made everybody look stupid. More so than C.C., Johan, Halladay or any other pitcher. Watch him this year. You might even jump the Met and Johan bandwagon for the Tim Lincecum one. That's how dominant he is.

tzrLDbHWaa	I don't really think that Wade played a better game than Gordon.  Wade actually had A LOT of mistakes that were covered up by the fact that he hit the game winning 3 because the refs won't call a travel on Wade.<br>  <br>  Look at the whole game.  In the first OT, Wade didn't even score.  The big star of the team doesnt score one point in the first OT?  He goes to the line with 17 seconds left and up 2, with a chance to ice the game and he misses them both, lets them tie, and still has a chance to win it at the end of the first OT but he chokes again.  Give a guy that many chances to win the game, AND let him travel as much as he wants, and he's bound to hit one.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	rofl your right. that's pretty crazy, maybe that was just a really good day.

pKX0lfMzaa	Well since I just read the spoiler from one of the answers, I'm going with my first pick on Christian. He returned not that long ago and needs to re-establish himself quickly to regain control as he did before. When I watched Raw, I noticed he didn't get that much cheers from the crowd as I thought he would. If he wins the bank match, I think he will be more known to the fans. He does deserve a chance to shine and get that extra push he needed back then before he left the company.<br>  <br>  Runner up -- MVP. Since this match is known to launch most of the stars who compete in here, my secondary pick is MVP. I do want him to win because he is a good talent the WWE has and should use to put him up in the main event in the soon future. He's getting over with the fans already, so I don't see any disagreement on having him win.<br>  <br>  Each person has their case on winning, but my personal choices on who I'd want to win is Christian and MVP. An honorable mention -- Kane. <br>  <br>  Vintage Answer.|`|m68HTA4paa	I'd like Shelton Benjamin or MVP to win it.  Nothing against Christian, but he's only been back in the WWE for a short while, and it would not send the dressing room the right message for him to win it ahead of guys who have been loyally serving the company for the last 3 years.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I love Kane and Christian but I love MVP just a little more. Some people are complaining about his face turn but I think it's great, and this coming from someone who usually likes heels. The only person who seems out of place is Mark Henry, if he wins I may riot.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	YES - Christian Qualifies Tomorrow Night in the Battle Royal. (Sorry for the Spoiler Everyone)<br>  <br>  And Finlay Qualifies on SD! (Again , Sorry for the Spoiler)|`|NZKramllaa	Yeah, just like what To Live said! Christian and Finlay already Qualifies. I really hope Christian takes it this Year.|`|smcDn76jaa	I want MVP to win. He has taken the brunt of his punishment and deserves this. <br>  <br>  BQ- On Smackdown it will either be R Truth or who I'm gunning for TBK.
ZbNXVQu7aa	Before I give my thoughts and rating, I have a confession.  I changed the channel before the end because I didn't want to put up with Triple H, which means the last thing I saw was Rey Mysterio, Finlay, and Christian celebrating in the middle of the ring after their victory over Kane, The Miz, and John Morrison.<br>  <br>  I loved everything I saw, but only because Ric Flair didn't get physically involved in the match between Chris Jericho and Kofi Kingston.<br>  <br>  I think even Undertaker had some goosebumps during that opening segment with HBK.  That's the only explanation I can come up with for his 2 minor errors during his mic time, and if that explanation is correct, it only adds to how special their segment truly was.<br>  <br>  Madison, Madison, Madison...  You're not JBL's only remaining fan.  He plays his role very well, and many people overlook that just because he's currently a midcard heel.  As for his match with C.M. Punk, I'll admit that I wanted JBL to stay down during Punk's final near-fall, but that's only because I was expecting Punk to use the GTS if JBL got up, and the only way a C.M. Punk match has ever disappointed me is if he uses the GTS and wins by pinfall immediately afterward (needless to say, I have no love for the GTS).  JBL's eye rake counter completely caught me by surprise, and I couldn't hide my excitement upon seeing the Clothesline From Hell.<br>  <br>  Women's Champion vs. Divas' Champion was shorter than I wanted it to be (I know... typical guy), but Maryse impressed me with her performance in that match.  I would say Melina also impressed me, but that wouldn't be a true statement because I've come to expect good matches from her.<br>  <br>  MITB needs wrestlers like Kofi in it, but I still want Kane to win.  As I said before, I'm just glad Flair didn't get physically involved.  His mind games on Jericho proved to be effective enough, and that's the side of Flair that I've come to admire throughout the years and want to remember for as long as I can.<br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of Christian, but he does have a gift for tag team wrestling.  I wonder if he'll be rising to main event status so he can reunite with Edge in the future.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of the 6-man tag match, I was hoping that Kane or Morrison would win, and I didn't care who either of them had to pin, but the match was executed so well that, as long as Kane wasn't pinned, I didn't care who won or lost.<br>  <br>  WQ: 8 out of 10 (it would be higher, but, mostly because of HHH, the HHH/Legacy angle isn't working for me)<br>  <br>  BQ: As is often the case when Undertaker makes an appearance, his segment is my favorite of the night.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	RAW was Awesome , Except for that Diva's Match...<br>  <br>  HBK/'Taker would've been Perfect had 'Taker Not Botched 2 Words.<br>  JBL is a Beast.

It was a great Raw from start to finish<br>  My favorite part is when JBL won, not because I am a huge JBL fan. But because maybe the IC title will actually get defended at Mania this year.

Even though he is better then some people like Matt Hardy, and Jericho.|`|oWJU0ky4aa	I would rate it 10 ++++ The best part was the whole thing with Cena, Vicky, Big Show, and the loser Edge.Also Triple H and (Snorton) Orton.<br>  The whole show was good but those things really stood out.|`|GQWGLSexaa	I rate it 9/10<br>  <br>  favorite moment: was the beginning when Taker and HBK were talking|`|c895d4afa4b170f865c8d7ec46d755faaa	The contract signing was my favorite segment, and for once I will credit that to Cena. The final scenes though I was expecting Orton to come out with a pistol or something|`|DgwqNbWKaa	5/10. It was ok, some of the angle's aren't pleasing me all that much. Flair coming out of retirement is a slap in the face to him and to Shawn Michaels, Y2J sucks now. Even when he was good he's not good enough to make this happen. Why doesn't he go face the 130 pound 14 year old girl he hit in the parking lot (disgraceful). It got 5/10 because beleave me it can be a lot better, I've seen it. I've also seen it at 0/10. However the HBK/Taker segment was a 9/10, should have been a 10/10, but they both seemed a little hesitent and fumbly on the delivery of the story and some of the lines. You barley ever see The Undertaker screw up his lines, especially on live TV, but he screwed up 3 times on Raw. You never EVER seen Shawn screw up a line, he almost screwed one up last night but saved it, they were hesitent though. Still awesome! Should be the main event at WrestleMania just like Ric Flair vs Shawn should have been the Main event for last year. <br>  Can't wait!!!! HBK 4 EVER!! Kick the Streak down Takers throat, even though I love Taker too! I think Taker will win at Mania though, that way they can say both of them won, Taker still has his streak and Shawn still wasn't out performed at Mania.|`|NZKramllaa	I know I was happy Christian was on RAW tonight too, but did you notice during Commentary while Christian was Wrestling, Cole could hardly mention him, he still kept the Conversation about Triple H/ Randy. but None the less, I'm glad he will be qualifying for MITB. I almost thought WWE forgot about him.<br>  <br>  HBK/ Taker was Excellent.<br>  <br>  The Triple H/ Orton Ending was great, I hope there are more RAW endings to come like this.<br>  <br>  I would give it a 9.3, a very good RAW.
XdQYUC2paa	He should get drafted to Smackdown<br>  <br>  Then when Edge has just had a tough match with say Cena or Show (the match would be like a last man standing match)<br>  <br>  Then a blooded Edge goes on the mic and says nobody can beat him then Christians music sounds and he beatsthe hell out of edge and wins the title<br>  <br>  Just like watch Edge did to Undertaker|`|m68HTA4paa	I don't think Christian should win the MITB. Would it give him a push? Yes, but as i've stated elsewhere, giving him the MITB win would send the wrong message to the dressing room seeing as how he's only been back in the WWE for a short while, whereas guys like Kane, MVP, and Shelton Benjamin have been putting their bodies on the line for the WWE all the time Christian's been on TNA. Unfortunately, for christian he's gonna have to pay his dues all over again.<br>  <br>  And, yes come draft time, he should move to either raw or smackdown.|`|CC3FZj9Caa	Christian wins MITB and then gets drafted to Smackdown. There he feuds with midcards Shelton Benjamin, MVP, etc for a while. And at Summerslam he cashes in against Edge himself. That would be interesting.<br>  <br>  I dont even know why he was put in ECW in the first place.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Agreed<br>  <br>  He Should Be WHC Or WWE But He's Doing Good Work On ECW|`|FEViNlQMaa	I want to but Kane should have it first then Christian on WM26|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I have said it before and i'll keep saying it until i die if he does win it, they have more loyal and just as talented wrestlers on the roster giving it to is a slap in the face to each one of them. The most impressive man from ECW should take the last spot and that is Evan Bourne, the more i see of christian the more i do see him main eventing but he hasn't been back long enough to have earned anything.
GTWpZHSFaa	of course you should try. u have nothing to lose right?!? if u r beating all the girls u should definitely run it. i'm a 400 runner and 110 hurdler for my school, but my xc time is like 21.20 (iknow, im slow, i'm a sprinter) but xc is a lot different from the 800's. i give u lots of props cuz the 800 is the hardest event. stay confident<br>  and<br>  good luck on ur track meet this wednesday !|`|NJUhQn60aa	the 800 meters - my favorite race to run when I was racing and to coach now.<br>  <br>  It has all elements, while pacing is important, there is also the need for speed.  I say try it - don't be afraid to take the first 400 hard, but not all out - just be a little aggressive.<br>  <br>  If you can't handle it, back off a little.  But if you save too much for the last 200 and the race is already too far past you then a kick will do you no good.  Don't save for the last 100-200 meters, run it even and run it honest.  If you have a kick, great, but never plan on a kick, run the race from the start.|`|jJTGKkSuaa	I'd try it...i mean...im a guy and statistically im better (not meaning to brag) but i mean..if ur beating all the girls..and ur not huffing and puffing...go for it...u might do well. I ran the 800m once in 8th grade (the last meet of the year and 8 pm that night was entry forms for the county meet) and i got into the county meet. i had no idea what i was doing. i was just a filler. but i did really good. you never know what u can do til you try.
2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Best player thus far this season. <br>  <br>  So its all on on individual performance. <br>  <br>  Right.<br>  <br>  Dywane, look at the stats, offensive, defensive, he can do it all. <br>  <br>  LeBron production is down from last year, because unlike last year he's winning this year.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	first half of the season - lebron<br>  since all star break - wade<br>  this is coming down between 2 people, but I think in the end LeBron barely, barely, barely escapes with the MVP trophy.|`|apY85Qmtaa	LeBron has been beasting all season. He deserves it.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Kobe.|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Wade is very, very hot... Not only scoring but he's also getting it on the assists and the steals. There is no doubt Dwyane is giving the most impact of the three. Also both James and Bryant have better teams to show off their records... Wade's Heat is very reliant to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	I've been saying LeBron for most of the season, but I'm starting to lean towards D-Wade.......<br>  <br>  To me it's a toss up....My answer is liable to change week to week, it's that close..........<br>  <br>  This month no doubt D-Wade has been superior.....|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Wade|`|Fh0shlVLaa	D Wade.|`|bpzI7SQkaa	kobe|`|mXQYbFiiaa	Wade|`|9XxQJLqUaa	wade|`|fZ38PPgSaa	my vote goes to wade|`|L2gILDzIaa	going to get some thumbs down, but I think it is between Wade and LBJ,  I think over the course of the entire year it is LBJ but since the all star break it is Wade.<br>  <br>  SO I am going with LBJ but would not mind if the votes come out to be Wade.<br>  <br>  If it is Kobe then people are not watching the games but just voting for their favorite player.|`|JcojiZRiaa	James. It will show when he heists the MVP trophy. Don't look at points per game.<br>  Lebron James doesn't play close to the minutes as Bryant or Wade.<br>  Look at all around game.<br>  James is a leader. He makes EVERYONE around him better.<br>  And unlike the two above mentioned players-James can't be stopped in the paint. Way too big and too strong.<br>  Look at his passing/assists.<br>  It's sick, you can't teach it.|`|QApr5C7laa	Wade for now. <br>  <br>  Looks like Kobe will go home without the MVP award or a ring this year.

tBuzrlSdaa	They played bad in everything and we have a bad record in Blazers home|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Their defense was terrible. They let Portland get away early in the game and shoot 11 3 pointers on 46% shooting. Besides that the Lakers only shot 43% from the field and they made a lot of crucial mistakes, Jordan Farmar and Sasha Vujacic in particular.<br>  <br>  Portland was on offensively though, it seemed anytime they were open they hit. Travis Outlaw, Steve Blake, even Aldridge was popping 3's.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	the blazers came to play man...........|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Shot like 35 % throughout the game and the refs were on the Blazers nuts!|`|IUxM3brbaa	Offense was ok.<br>  <br>  Teams shot about same % overall. 44% vs 48%. Portland only took one more shot too.<br>  <br>  So what was it?<br>  <br>  100% more foul calls on Lakers by the beginning of third. Refs kept Kobe, Odom, Fisher in foul trouble whole game. Bad calls all night. The game was decided at the beginning of the third by the refs.|`|ebe1a0eaf9d16d72943f5c8661b58332aa	You  realli wouldnt care playing a team that has a record of 40 n 23 against playing a team like the celtics or tha cavs. that is when u bring ur A game|`|7v9cjUxgaa	BLAZERS ARE THE MOTHA FUCKIN BEST<br>  DUHHHH|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Portland got so many ticky tack fouls go their way it was pathetic.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	Tough game for Lakers. Odom fouled out and Kobe was in trouble foul trouble. The Ariza incident was the "cherry on the top." The crowd clearly upheld their enthusiasm, all the while the Blazers were shooting lights out from 3 point country .458%. The Blazers shot better from 3 point range than the Lakers shot period .439%. Defensively the Lakers were horrible and didn't get it together until it was too late. Finally, too many turnovers! Perfect recipe for a blowout!<br>  <br>  Be patient Bynum will be back before you know it. Blazers don't worry me, especially because Lakers will have home court in playoffs! <br>  <br>  I'm done here!
P93I8CHtaa	man i cant believe we lost,this sucks|`|NEtVRjplaa	It would be a blessing if we can manage 2-1 on the road. W/o Odom.. all we can do is hope that other players step up.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Dude, take some advice, when your a Laker fan, you need to be an exclusive Laker fan.  Quit feeling bad for Rudy, it was his fault he flailed his arms as he fell, causing him to fall on his right arm.  I am in no way gonna feel sorry for him...|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Yeah, you're right... The Lakers game had been all bad tonight and the with injury to Rudy Fernandez and Ariza ejected, only made it worse. The Lakers will just have to regroup and get ready for the Texas Triangle.<br>  <br>  The Rockets, the Spurs, and the Mavericks... If they could regroup and come back with some wins, the Lakers should be all right coming out of this road trip.<br>  <br>  ***Someone answer this*** Did Lamar Odom really get suspended? If he did, for what???|`|gDkAsUGKaa	I know its so upsetting :( why cant my team freaking win in portland?

K5AeQuSNaa	Polarbear, the mind control lasers seem to be a bit strong for you today.  You may need to add another layer of tinfoil to your hat there to counteract them...<br>  <br>  As for shotguns, if it is not under 26 inches in length when the stock is folded, and the barrel is at least 18 inches long, you will be fine.  You can't put a pistol grip and folding stock on a seni-auto shotgun with a detachable magazine here.  But a semi-auto with a fixed (tubular) magazine that holds 10 rounds or less is kosher.  California laws are petty and stupid, but they are written by morons, so there are huge legal loopholes.  If you have more questions about what is or is not legal, go hit calguns.net for real expert advise.  Those guys know all the ins and outs of the law here.<br>  <br>  (edit)<br>  Yup, 9 out of 10 voices in his head say that he is being watched.  As are we all.

6HZWTPncaa	yes, your coach is right about the footwork. good footwork can gain the best leverage and can give you the upper hand against an opponent. also, in some situations footwork is everything, especially if your feet aren't as fast as you'd like.<br>  <br>  for faster feet i'd say try grapevines/cross-overs and foot fires.<br>  for faster speed (as much as i know you hate them) sprints or try getting up out of your stance off the line as fast as you can repeatedly.|`|Oa7lX9m9aa	What?

There are other sports to watch.  There's NBA.  March Madness is starting up.  NHL.  NASCAR Racing.  IRL will be starting up soon.  Baseball spring training has started.  World Cup qualifiers are taking place, the U.S. has their next game on the 28th.  Think soccer is boring?  Watch that WC qualifier on the 28th and see for yourself.

Am I fast enough, tall enough, big enough, do I need to run faster, jump higher, how do I improve my arms, legs, neck, speed, strength, 40 time, etc.<br>  <br>  Answers to these annoying questions.<br>  <br>  Do us a favor and search for the question. There has been way more than enough time to ask these questions every possible way under the sun and then sun. You are adding nothing to this collective pot. Get creative and think of a different topic. Get original.<br>  <br>  While the predictions are amusing, and I have did more than my fair share in taking part in these questions, there is still way too much time before these questions become relevant. The rest of free agency, the draft, OTA's, minicamps, summer camps, training camp, the preseason, the roster cuts, and injuries all determine lots before the season starts. Let's hold off on the prediction until at least we are little bit closer. Thanks.<br>  <br>  Here is a perfect answer for all of those questions that deal with getting faster, better, quicker, taller, stronger, etc: train...<br>  How hard is that? Unless you want the p*ssy way out and use 'roids, better off just training your butt off. Want to run faster: train or train harder. Want to jump higher: train or train harder. Want to increase your 40 time: train or train harder. Want to learn to catch more balls: train or train harder. Are you getting the frickin point? It's all quite simple.<br>  <br>  This question is spot on, and is one that I will star for. I am sick of these questions, over and over again. Thanks for letting me vent, I will get off of the soapbox now. Whew!|`|GUjr6whNaa	ppl are not posting any good questions and most of the questions are the same or similar<br>  <br>  (will t.o. do well?, will t.o. cause problems?, should they have signed t.o.?) <br>  <br>  NFL needs some good trades or signings to get things moving again|`|F6A7FR6uaa	I agree, once the draft starts up it will get going and once the regular season kicks off, there's going to be some interesting topics.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Yep.

1a4f8OD1aa	cuz unless you can find a guy that is six foot wide by four feet tall then he wouldnt cover the whole net. and in the NHL they can fit the puck through the smalles crack.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	No ****<br>  <br>  <br>  good question|`|tW8fh4IGaa	That's dumb. Even the biggest guy you find would never cover the entire net. If he were standing up, only his goalie pads would be blocking the bottom part of the net...easy goal. If he were laying down, the entire top of the net would be open...again, easy goal. No person, no matter who fat they are would ever cover an entire net from top to bottom and NHLers can pick corners from the blue line. Terrible idea.|`|9NCGmJbSaa	If you think about it, you wouln;t gain much...<br>  <br>  Pad width has limitations<br>  His 5 hole would suck so just shoot there all the time<br>  If he goes down... you just shoot rite under the cross bar because his reflexes suck...<br>  <br>  A sumo wrestler would be more effective on the powerplay.<br>  Planting himself infront of the net to block the goalies view.<br>  Get it to the point, screen the goalie... pass it to the other side... slap it... its in.<br>  <br>  Here is a pic of a sumo playing goalie<br>  <a href="http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/1goalieback.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/a...</a>|`|4crJhN62aa	How is he going to move to protect the little little spot that he leaves open, there are no summo wrestlers BIG ENOUGH that can completely cover the net so he will be to slow to stop shots in the open area and won't be able to endure a full keep and get a heart attact.YOU MUST BE KIDDING RIGHT.|`|058qleIWaa	hahaha thats hilarious. after they put on all their gear there wouldnt be a goal just a summo. haha|`|SfTWwm97aa	Because sumo fatties are SLOW.

rseD4OG2aa	No doubt about it, MVP is going to win this year's Money in the Bank. I was actually hoping, considering the big stage, that the match would be a bit more competitive, I don't really like it when it becomes to predictable. <br>  MVP is in the beginning of a monster face push right now. I mean, it's only a few weeks into it and he's already got the crowd hugely behind him. They've been giving him big wins and have really put him on a role. I don't think that winning the United States Championship will accomplish anything for him so Money in the Bank seems like the best option. <br>  I guess that Christian has a shot, but something's telling me that it's just to soon since his return to put him on the main event stage. Plus, and I don't agree with this, Vince has never been all that high on Christian. I would be shocked to see him win, but if he does he'd have to leave ECW right away at the draft and that wouldn't be good, he just got there.<br>  Kane would sort of be the feel-good option to win, but I don't see it happening. As much as I would like it to, he doesn't get many big wins any more. He's said in the past as well that he's perfectly content to put over the younger talent, which is a pretty cool thing to do, and Money in the Bank is the perfect place to do it.<br>  If Shelton Benjamin could ever improve on the mic I'd love to see him win the briefcase, but ever week they put the mic in his hands and every week my dog comes off with more charisma. It's a shame, because he's incredibly talented, but he can't cut a promo to save his life. <br>  The others don't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning, and I would really like to see MVP win, so he's my pick, all things considered.|`|m68HTA4paa	I think benjamin will win it and get a main event push. What makes you so sure he won't get a push and the other guys will? <br>  <br>  I feel the MITB will be used to give up and coming superstars a push. That rules out Kane and Finlay and Mark Henry. <br>  <br>  Christian has only been back in the WWE for a short while and it would not send the dressing room the right message to give him a push ahead of guys like MVP and shelton benjamin who have been bustin' their backs for the WWE while Christian has been in TNA. So that rules out Christian. <br>  <br>  Punk won't win it twice in a row. That rules out Punk. <br>  <br>  Kofi may get a main event push in the future but right now he is below MVP and Shelton in the pecking order. That rules out Kofi.<br>  <br>  That leaves MVP and Shelton, and I expect Shelton to get the win.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	Well out of the ones you have of the top 3 Christian is the most probable. I think they are going to try and have MVP and Benjamin in a long feud for the US title|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Kane will most likely never be World champion again, despite many fans clamoring for it. I say if they're serious about pushing Christian, he should win it.|`|AA10557416	Christian|`|W8SgRKo7aa	i think mvp or someone will come in and win it...<br>  <br>  henry would crush the ladder its a stupid idea...and well kane dunno never seen him rreally climb a ladder.|`|tkzW2a4maa	Christian, because that sure would be a great comeback win, and his going to win..|`|PxjE6fQ6aa	mvp or christian is gonna win it all the way!|`|NZKramllaa	I'm really Pushing for Christian, I don' think Kane will win, MVP seems like a Credible Contender to win it, but lets be Simple, MVP isn't considered Main-Event yet! and Christian is. I think MVP will win his Title back then work his way up to main- event, but He won't do it by winning MITB. I think Christian will win because his big push is long Over- due and One of the reason's why he left WWE in the first Place.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I'm hoping Kane wins, but I'm not expecting it... which, ironically, might be enough of a reason for WWE to give him the victory.<br>  <br>  Out of Christian and MVP, I can make a case against either of them winning, but if I rule out both of them, then I have to go against your line of thinking and pick one of the other 5, and the only one of them I can see winning is somebody who's been in so many MiTB matches before and still hasn't won one, Shelton Benjamin.  The problem then is, if my case against MVP involves a feud with Benjamin over the U.S. title, how can I reasonably argue in favor of Benjamin winning MiTB?<br>  <br>  I can't, so I guess I'm expecting Christian to win.  Below is a list as to why.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. I agree with you on not seeing a main event push for Kofi Kingston or Finlay at WrestleMania 25<br>  2. I have no idea how Mark Henry will be able to climb a ladder without it breaking.  If he can pull off that feat (that's a big "if"), only then does he deserve to win.<br>  3. When C.M. Punk returns to the main event level, it will be one of three ways: winning a #1 Contender match, winning a Royal Rumble, or qualifying for an Elimination Chamber match.<br>  4. I see MVP and Shelton Benjamin feuding over the U.S. title for the next few months, and giving either of them the MiTB victory at WM25 could potentially cut that feud short (or lead to one of them screwing the other out of successfully cashing in the title shot).<br>  5. As much as I want Kane to win, I just can't bring myself to expect or predict that.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Christian or Kane. I can't choose between the two...so I won't.<br>  I wouldn't be surprised if MVP won though. It wouldn't bother me either.<br>  Honestly though, I think Kennedy should get the last spot and have a return win. It will keep his momentum up and will take him straight to the main event. I really hope he gets this chance. I know you and others said he won't return by Mania. I think he might though. My feeling is either out of sheer hope, or my sixth sense....we shall see...|`|gfxXikenaa	MVP might be getting a push , Christian will be going for the ECW title in my opinion.|`|41WXZPnCaa	MVP<br>  <br>  Need It More <br>  <br>  As Kane And Christian Has Been At Least One Time World Champion|`|CC3FZj9Caa	Christian....he'll cash it against Edge at Summerslam
rseD4OG2aa	That would be awesome. I'm kind of surprised that they're bringing in Austin for the Jericho-Legends program, I always kind of assumed that the feud would culminate with a Chris Jericho-Hulk Hogan match. Having Austin in the mix would be a pretty tough act for anyone to follow, even Hulk Hogan.<br>  If Austin is healthy enough to compete with Jericho at Wrestlemania then I would love it if he came back for the feud. I would prefer Austin-Jericho to Jericho-Hogan, but from what I've heard Austin is pretty much out of commission. It wouldn't surprise me if he isn't involved with the Jericho storyline, though I'm not sure where else he would fit.<br>  One things for sure though. Both Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan have to be involved with Wrestlemania 25 in some way. I mean, that is where they both cemented their legend status. It would just seem to big to have both of them involved in the same program without facing each other, which is clearly out of the question. <br>  I'd love to see Jericho get stunnered one more time though...|`|pKX0lfMzaa	That seems like a probable scenario. I don`t seem him attacking Jericho, but more of an up front back and forth promo. It would be more of an intimidating thing for Jericho to even attack him and I think Austin would rather save it for the big event. <br>  <br>  I do see Flair cutting a promo denying the match with Jericho coming out. Then I can possibly see Austin there, but if it isn't I can see Terry Funk out there. I`d rather see Austin as we're nearing to the event and need to build up the matches from this point on. I can see a lot of "I beat you on the same night as I did to The Rock to become the first Undisputed Champion" and so on.<br>  <br>  Vintage stuff.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	I like that scenario. Sounds good, but I think to make it more special Austin should whip Jericho at Wrestlemania. Flair needs to stay out of the ring.|`|JC06fESWaa	lol that would be calfargalisticly awesum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol seriously man it would only be better if jericho got permenantly injured for life and never came back|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Like that for Raw but if I was going to do Wrestlemania I would pick the Rock to face him.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Yeah<br>  Blind man in Chicago sees this one coming...<br>  <br>  LOL: Flair cuts Prom..that I can believe!  :)|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Wow, I didn't know it was actually going to happen. I hoped it would. I thought it might, but didn't know it was official. <br>  <br>  I can't wait to hear SCSA trash talk Jericho!! <br>  <br>  Maybe, Austin will interrupt Jericho/Flair Promo. Then Stun Jericho|`|aULZ8D10aa	MY all time faviorte vs. my current faviorte. HELL YEAH!|`|hkAcgIMbaa	For some reason I have been getting this feeling that Stone Cold is going to Stunner Flair and work with Jericho. Think about it Jericho has bagged a lot of legends even Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat who isn't even in the HOF but he has not bagged Steve once but I know this is very unlikely that he is going to the hall of fame but I reckon that might happen.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Agreed That's What I Have In Mind But U Said All <br>  <br>  <br>  To Live And Die For New RAW Head Booker lol Just Kiddig Cool Idea Man|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I would love to see Stone Cold Steve Austin open a can of whoop *** on Jericho & shut his big mouth|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Really hope it happens.

kQSSz2X2aa	Whilst putting a halt to the infamous caliber wars is indeed admirable, I highly doubt it will ever end.

But this debate is just like the .308/30-06...it will NEVER end.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	The army US switched from .38 revolver back to old .45 when they found that people unfamiliar with guns and hopped up on drugs did not die as quickly as civilized opponents who know that they are supposed to die when they get shot.  Sometime doing more damage is the only way to bring someone down.  Read Stiff by Marry Roach for more details and probable references.<br>  <br>  Also why the special forces can use a 1911 if they want to.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Unfortunately, too many confuse effectiveness of rounds for combat with effectiveness of rounds for self defense.<br>  <br>  There is a difference. An armed and trained enemy soldier is different than an armed attacker. To begin with, they have entirely different objectives.<br>  <br>  One is determined from the outset to kill you and that death is a possibility. The other may be willing to kill you, but dying is NOT in his game plan. With that mindset, one expects to get shot at, the other thinks that showing you a weapon will turn your knees to jelly and you will become a sniveling and compliant victim. <br>  <br>  The former will likely remain focused on his objective even under heavy fire. The latter has a reputation of immediately breaking off an attack when shot at. If he does not, that gives me more chances to hit him.<br>  <br>  Funny, but I have never heard of a criminal sticking to a fight simply because the other guy was only shooting a 9mm or .38 at him.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	9MM is fine......<br>  <br>  I don't care what has more / less power....<br>  <br>  The 9MM does the job and that's all I care about....<br>  <br>  I am so cheap I squeak!...

I believe it to be more lethal than any handgun you can hide in your shorts.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	I carry a 45acp Kimber have carried and fired all listed And like the power and stopping power of the 45acp>|`|FUc5BQtEaa	I usually do a lot of ballistic research on any caliber that I am interested in, and I have done quite a bit of research on both the 9mm and .45 acp. Lets consider the following in order to create a thoery as to what should be better at stopping based on scientific law.<br>  <br>  Newton's first law of physics: An object in motion tends to stay in motion, until acted upon by an outside force.<br>  <br>  Newton's third law of physics: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br>  <br>  A .45 bullet is around a .451-.452 caliber, while the 9mm is about a .380 caliber.<br>  <br>  A .45 uses bullets that range anywhere from about 185 grains to 300 grains, while a 9mm uses bullets from 105 grains to 150-160 grains I think.<br>  <br>  Both bullets create similar energy when factory loads are used.<br>  <br>  Now, here is how I like to look at them, when you have a 230 grain .451 caliber bullet traveling at about 900 fps generating around 350-390 lbs. of energy it's pretty hard to stop. And when you have a 123 grain .380 caliber bullet traveling at around 1200 fps generating around 350-390 lbs. of energy, it still hits pretty hard. You will find that if you punch in those stats on a ballistic calculator, the 9mm does loose energy a lot faster than the .45 ACP<br>  <br>  But lets remember the laws of motion, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction," and, "An object in motion tends to stay in motion untill acted upon by an outside force. Considering the first law, and object that weighs more should stay in motion longer because the forces that are pressing on that object are lessened because of the sheer weight. And the same is true for the lighter bullet, because is is lighet it should be an easier object to slow, no matter the speed of either.<br>  <br>  When you think of the third law, you have to realize that when one object contacts another, one of the objects will, figurativly speaking, 'win' the battle of force. Because the relative energy of both bullets is the same, and speed really has nothing to do with penetration in the incedent of impact (excluding the fact that you need speed to gain inertia in an object. This is meerly to compair the energy transfer of a bullet to the object that is contacted) then the heavier bullet, even though it has a slower initial speed, should penetrate deeper into any object than the lighter bullet because of the inheriant laws of motion.<br>  <br>  Since this is just theory that is made though laws of motion, the logical asumption is that the .451 caliber bullet going about 900 fps with the same energy should be able to transfer more of the energy into penetration than the 9mm going 1200 fps because the heavier bullet is harder to stop. <br>  <br>  I must say that anything taken from a survey for 'one shot stops' is inaccurate as this is biased towards whatever caliber is used most in the survey, not an average of all calibers used. <br>  <br>  There's my two cents. Hope you enjoy it.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	Ok here is the truth.<br>  <br>  If a person is hit in the heart, he dies. That is fact. The Brain is also a sure winner. I guess what I am saying is that the shot placement is a factor. <br>  <br>  Now there are only 2 places that a bullet must strike on a person that ensures a one shot stop, the brain, and the spine at nipple level or up. <br>  <br>  I know that the .357 holds a great value to the law enforcement community, but the truth is that most officers up until 20 years ago carried either .357, or 38. This is why it enjoys such good statistics. <br>  <br>  Another factor to consider is that up untill the 70's, the US had a draft. Military personell shoot well. The law enforcement community at one time was made up of mostly military trained men. Today that percentage is is less than 25 percent. This also accounts for one shot drops in the LE world.<br>  <br>  I also know that the .45 makes a .45 caliber wound while the 9 mm makes a .38 caliber wound, thus in the event of a wound that is not an instant drop, the suspect/bad guy bleeds more rapidly.<br>  <br>  I however in a battle would say that most people that are armed with only one side arm, IE a pistol, want 15 to 19 rounds, rather than the 7 to 10 that a .45 offers.<br>  <br>  Also a 9mm with a 15 round capacity is lighter than a .45 with a 8 round capacity. It also posseses a smaller grip that is a consideration, when a police department chooses a gun/caliber combo for the masses in their department. <br>  <br>  In a SWAT team, where your side arm is seldom used because you roll with a long gun such as a M4, sub-gun or 12 gauge, ammo capacity is not as important as the biggest wound, a .45 is prefered.<br>  <br>  Now a 500 Smith and Wesson is a hand cannon that shoots such a huge bullet so fast that it is devastaing, but it is not a carry gun. It is too huge to carry, but is the most powerful production gun out there.<br>  <br>  I  think that the .40, which is a 10 mm bullet, does not provide much more effectiveness over a 9mm, that it should be considered better. I carry a .40 on duty an a police officer, and would not feel any less armed with a 9mm. A 45 however is a huge difference. <br>  <br>  The .45 caliber ACP has served since 1911, and still is a prefered caliber among Spec Op personell. The 45 colt came about in the 1870,s and is still a popular revolver for home defense as well as hunting. <br>  <br>  All this, consider that the 9mm was developed pre WW2, the .45ACP was developed in 1905, and the 357 in the 30's. So to answer your question, NO! MODERN CALIBERS DO NOT OFFER THAT MUCH MORE!!! They been around for years. The question is if you want big and heavy, as opposed to light, and lots of ammo.<br>  <br>  I chose long ago on the big bore guns, and love a .45. ACP, and .44 Mag.<br>  <br>  I will also say that In my 12 years as a police officer in an urban enviroment, I have seen lots of gunshot wounds. Those created by a .45 are recognizable by simply looking at it. A 9mm, a .40, a .38, or a .380 all look the same. I also have seen several victims die from shot in the abdominal area with a .45, and others survive lung shots from a 9mm. <br>  <br>  Also remenber your physics. An object pushing a projectile forward, can not exert more than is backward. Stoping power is myth. It is you reaction to being shot that causes you to fall. Similarly, if I stick you in the arce with a pin, you jump because you reacted to the pin, not any shock. Don't get too lost in energy as well as stopping power. Larger calibers make bigger holes. THAT IS IT!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks. Good Question|`|H4dswqRlaa	You don't mention which stuff is the myths you feel need debunking! The Mozambique Drill mentioned in the article is the standard 2-tap officers used whose 45ACP's and 357's were taken away and replaced with 9mm Parabellums, with an included head shot when the 2-tap proved in many cases to also not be enough! The real 2-tap is a round in each lung, by the way. Actual stats for police confrontations and what weapons made a one hit stop, list the 125 grain JHP 357 full-power load as #1. Second is the 45 ACP (Auto) with pretty much any load in it. So the big hydrostatic splash-shock of the 357 medium weight bullet slightly edges the big bore heavy and slow bullet straining the connected tissues, in incapacitative effects, but not by much. The 40 S&W is a combination of both. Regards, Larry.|`|yskbjvT1aa	In the blogs I write in I get questions like this all the time. How anything under 40 S&W is a 'mouse' gun. And any personal defense cartridge should always start with a 4. While my personal preference is a .45 acp mini-auto I do on occasional carry a 9mm and even a Walther PP in .32 acp.<br>  I usually answer the poo poo's with this question.<br>  If a .32 is such a ineffective mouse gun would you please let me shoot you with one?  <br>  I have not had any takers yet or any more discussion on the subject.

sJznih8raa	i think so. I think garko will be the primary 1b and shoppach the primary catcher, leaving victor to DH a lot, but also fill in at 1b and C from time to time. shoppach's too good to not play, like the others, so I think Wedge will have no choice but to rotate things and put whoever is hot at the time in the best position to produce runs. this is assuming everyone stays pretty healthy and he has the luxury of having these 3 options all season. <br>  <br>  time will tell, but if cleveland can stay healthy, look out|`|xQFWjFyZaa	I think the most likely scenario is Shoppach behind the plate, V-Mart at 1st, and Hafner/Garko splitting at DH.

e0M5lpc2aa	Utley, he's at a position with far less depth than Longoria at 3B, and over the past 3 seasons been the best 2B by far. Had he not been injured or gotten worn out he was the NL MVP, and still he hit 32HR. Once he's healthy, he's my pick. Pedroia is a good choice, but I stick with Utley because his power numbers. Grabbing power at a middle infield position, especially if you can get it at both 2B and SS can be devastating.
WrDGhduxaa	When you had a 10 second slow down in the second lap it means you either went out too fast or did not have the training to hold the pace.<br>  You should be able to run the first lap about 6 or 7 seconds slower than your 400 time and finish about 10 to 15 seconds slower than your 400 time doubled. <br>  With your 5K time showing that you have distance ability and your 400 time shows you have good speed, you need to train for the 800 and should be able to run the 800 in under 2:10 and probably close to 2:05.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Now it can be done...but it depends. I would like to look at your 400m time.....if you are running 55's-59, but preferably sub 59's....you could do it. <br>  <br>  Your 5k time is excellent, but for the next few months you have to leave that if you are going to concentrate on the 800m.|`|NJUhQn60aa	yes, dropping 11 seconds is possible.<br>  <br>  Those are nice better than average times for a high school runner.  Hopefully you are a bit stronger than last year and can do more in practice.<br>  <br>  2:05 is a nice time to shoot for.|`|33rME1ryaa	yes this is possible. i am a girl and ran the 800m. i started out at 2:45 and got it down to about 2:27. all you have to do is keep working at it and  you should be fine.|`|ckNjHiZzaa	See Lestermount's comments above.  Also, do a 3-4 mile tempo run once per week at 17:58mpm (20 seconds per mile slower than your 5K race pace).|`|KgOvoFThaa	yap...it is okay...practice and it will make it improve|`|BPoNygWUaa	From what I see it is possible. HS Boys track is a little different than on the girls side. You have girls who are dominant throughout all 4 years or who can show up as a freshman and as their bodies mature, they slow down. Boys always tend to take off once they are accustomed to their event. You will need to add muscle mass. Not in high quantities. Don't become muscle-bound, it will just slow you down. <br>  <br>  2:05 is entirely within reach. The key is consistency. :63/:73 isn't bad as a freshman. Your goal this year is to get the second split down to the sub :70 and into ~:65 eventually. Don't expect the 2:05 right away. It will come in time and usually all the hard work with tapering helps.<br>  <br>  This is just my personal take but it seems like you may be even more suited to a 1600m/3200 guy. The 5k time as a freshman is dominant. I assume its XC and if so, take into account the course. It just seems like a time under 18:00 can be worked on. 1600m should be around 4:45 and 3200 probably high 10s. Give it a shot. If you don't like it and find your heart is in the 800, then that is the great part of Track and Field.|`|c5UMEpFKaa	Yes, very possible its a long season and you have been training a lot. Working out with your team will should help a lot, but watch out for injuries.

PJQ1Nm1Oaa	Tell him that nothing in life is guaranteed.  Anything can happen at any given time, but if he says that they will lose, then they probably will.  That isn't fair to his teammates, the coach, or himself.  If you think positively good things have a better chance of happening.  They practice too hard to go into a game thinking that they are gonna lose.<br>  <br>  I used to think that we were gonna win against the best team in the sate and I was always so mad when we ended up losing.  That team always told me that I should move to their school to play and I would start and that my team let me down.  I just told them that I let my team down I know their was more that I should have done.  If you think you are gonna lose, their isn't much you can do to help your team.|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	i think you should say " i know you tried your best. there's always next game :]"|`|Oi9W3mcKaa	Well, i think that that is a good answer; after all, that is how they should have felt, and it is a nice way to get your point across. Just don't be too forceful, and don't be all "i told you so" about it. be nice, considerate, and polite about it (after all, he just lost a game...), and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|i0SIecw6aa	"say really? that sucks. well you'l get it next time. at least you got one kind of game goin for ya ;D"<br>  <br>  im serious too, so dont think im mocking. guys love open flirting.<br>  <br>  good luck hun
kFcdwVwdaa	i agree 100%. now we know the lakers have their problems at the Rose Garden but seriously there was too many no calls for the Lakers and too many b.s. calls for the Blazers. <br>  <br>  oh and btw wade guy, stern has nothing to do with the officiating. do you think he had something to do with that ref who is in jail now for fixin games? <br>  but if he did, why wouldn't he want them to win, it creates the playoff drama from the early 2000's. more ratings too.|`|ExVTrokAaa	you make some great points but we lost to a team that came in fearless and motivated to beat the best team in the NBA and not so much the refs help.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	CAn you believe, the audacity of Laker fans....blaming the REFS.....LMAO.....the audacity<br>  <br>  Tell me, why on Earth would David Stern want the BLAZERS to beat the Lakers?? Huh? LMAO|`|apY85Qmtaa	Laker fans b*tching that they lost a fair game and using the refs as a scapegoat....what's new? Quite pathetic, really.|`|tJbM7v8caa	Blazers took control no other explanation. Lakers didnt show up because the Rose Garden is impossible for them to play in. Anyone could have predicted it.<br>  <br>  Also blazers more aggressive = more calls.|`|Y2fde4Qjaa	Yes, professional referees were thinking "Oh, lets rig the game for the blazers". Lakers got beat, get over it.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	W.A.D.E poster, stfu, i would agree with you that using the foul slogan is lame, but the facts are true, 100% more fouls called on the Lakers.

Nuj1eScCaa	I think it will be a very physical series. Not because of tonight, but because most games between the Blazers and Lakers are physical games. <br>  <br>  The thing is that the Lakers will regroup and will be ready for the next time they play in April and any series in the postseason. On the other hand, the Blazers are well aware of the Lakers mortality and I'm sure they'll try to take advantage.|`|1a4f8OD1aa	lakers in four. kobe will take over and score 40 plus in at least 3 of the games. and this is coming from someone who hates the lakers.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	That would be tough!

jBN0Jq7baa	Well i suffered the same problem through highschool and often times i found it helpful to completely forget the score (i had a watch that kept score, you'd just press a button and it'd ad the score) most of the times this helped me relax on the court because i was simply taking it a point at a time and not thinking about how many points i had to win to come back in a game. Secondly, your coach will tell you to keep your eyes on the seams of the ball...that's bullcrap. What worked for me was developing the points, if i couldn't go for my shots id develop the point and wait for my chance to strike, doing this allowed me to increase my confidence. I would think before the point, im going to attack his forehand and try to push him back, then im going to hit a drop shot. Having a plan takes off alot of pressure|`|rl0NfUZFaa	i used to do the same thing, and ended up losing, so now i just hit the ball as i would during a friendly rally. trust me it works!!!!!!!|`|IrWFzPpMaa	Basically just think of the tennis match as a practice session and try some things out,even if you lose the first 3-4 games or so. Really tell yourself to apply everything you know and just go out and hit the shots that you hit. You basically have to let go of your fear and just go for the shots.Eventually, you'll be able to hit those shots that you really want to hit without thinking about it. Just concentrate and tell yourself to hit through the ball,and most of all have confidence in yourself.|`|KwqZmlZRaa	there's no real magic trick to help nervousness and anxiety etc before and during a tennis match. what helped me was experience. eventually you will break free of freezing up and before you know it you will be hitting better than during practice. always remind yourself, your always going to miss shots during a match, that's okay, its impossible not to, but don't play unnaturally just because you think you will mess up. go for it! experiment and learn your limits!<br>  good luck|`|gPqBBfsgaa	Improve on your mechanics for a stable game.<br>  <br>  Fix your problems at <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com</a> <br>  <br>  You have to sign up, but it's quick and FREE.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Highly unlikely.  The players had tuned out Therrien according to Orpik, Fleury, and Kennedy so I don't think the addition of Gonchar would have changed that.<br>  <br>  As for 100 point scorers<br>  Malkin has scored 94 points in 67 games, an average of 1.40pts/game. If he plays the rest of the season....he'll have 115pts (82 games)<br>  <br>  Crosby has scored 1.32pts a game over 62 games.  If he plays the rest of the year, he'll have 102 points (77 games)<br>  <br>  Ovechkin ranks 3rd in pts/game at 1.31. If he ha maintains that pace without missing a game, he'll have 104 points (79 games)<br>  <br>  If Parise (on pace for 98), Datsyuk (on pace for 97) and Iginla (on pace for 97) can get a few extra points over the last 5 weeks - they could possibly do it as well.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	The sad thing is, everyone was making predictions on if when Gonchar comes back, would the team be better? But a coaching change came during the same time so nobody will ever know if it's because of Gonchar or a coach change.<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I miss Therrien.. But I think the players just DIDN'T want to play for him and really wanted a change.. So making themselves lose a bunch of games causing them to perhaps not get into the playoffs, was the only thing they could do to get that change? who knows.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	I dont think they would be.  Although they got Gonchar back, it seems that the strategy of Bylsma has had an equal effect.  With Therrien, I could have seen them go like 5-3-1 but not 8-1-1.  He was too laid back for what has become a dire situation to make the playoffs.<br>  <br>  I could see 3 finish with over 100 points (Malkin, Ovechkin, Crosby), but I will predict that only two do it. (Malkin and Ovechkin)|`|e1cb70d67a88fb798cb0cf01983c5ed8aa	I think its a little bit of both..<br>  <br>  The players were tuning out Therrien so a new voice did help..<br>  <br>  Also, the addition of Gonchar has been huge.. Now with Kunitz and Guerin joining the team, there's a little more depth down the stretch|`|9NCGmJbSaa	I don't think Therien would have gotten them to 8-1-1 in the last 10 but like you said, the team has gotten better with additions and Gonchar coming back so i think at leat 6 wins would have come with Therien.<br>  <br>  As foe 100 point guys...<br>  the top 3 are almost a guarantee<br>  The 4th is likely<br>  The 5th is a maybe<br>  <br>  1. Malkin - 100%<br>  2. Ovechkin - 100%<br>  3. Crosby - 100%<br>  4. Datsyuk - 90%<br>  5. Parise - 50%<br>  <br>  I doubt Iggy will do it... He has gotten 7 points in the last 2 games but how long can he hold that up? he will have to slow down at some point.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I think a healthy Gonchar (at the start), combined with the trading deadline pickups have helped.<br>  <br>  Take away any team's equivalent of a Gonchar, and that's a tough blow.  It also doesn't help that Pittsburgh lost a ton of grit in the offseason.|`|G33E41IBaa	Penguins weren't doing well under Therrien...I doubt they would have suddenly bounced back and gotten a 6 game winning streak.  The new coach definitely shook the team up to demand more from the players.  The addition of Chris Kunitz definitely helped.  He works great with Staal.<br>  <br>  I think right now, Malkin, Ovechkin, and Crosby are definitely going to finish with 100 points.  Parise and Datsyuk might squeak in there.

fyKSTMAfaa	I agree.  I've always been a Kurt Warner fan.  <br>  <br>  But there are other very inspiring stories.  Jerome Harrison went from practice squad player that was on the verge of being cut a few years ago to becoming the most dominant defender in the NFL.  The hard work and dedication he has given to the game to be what he is should be an inspiration to all.<br>  <br>  What about Tom Brady?  Sure, he's living the dream life now.  But he was never expected to amount to anything when he was drafted in the 7th round in the 2000 NFL draft.<br>  <br>  How about Matt Cassel?  He was in the shadows at USC, backing up Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart.  Now he's an NFL starter, and Leinart is holding a clip board for Warner in Arizona.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure I could go on and on.  But I still think Kurt Warner is the greatest rags to riches to back to rags to riches again story in NFL history.  He never, ever gave up.  Even when it looked like his NFL cinderella story was over, he kept fighting and working hard and came back once again to prove what a great player he truly is.|`|1n5E6ensaa	Warrick Dunn or Kurt Warner are the two that come to mind. <br>  Warrick does a lot of great things for single mothers and under privledged children by buying them homes in safer neighborhoods.

nRBC4E5saa	By "mixed martial arts" I assume you're referring to the modern sport that's featured in the UFC and similar events?  Mixed martial arts techniques are drawn from a number of martial arts disciplines, including Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiujitsu, karate, Taekwondo, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, and Judo.  MMA is not a singular martial art.<br>  <br>  If you want to have the techniques explained to you so that you can understand what's going on, the most cost-effective source is Youtube.<br>  <br>  If you want to be able to perform the techniques, you will need to find a coach or instructor, especially if you have no previous experience.  Trying to learn how to fight through videos is like trying to learn how to fly an aircraft through videos.  Knowing all the terminology and understanding what's going on won't keep you from crashing and burning.<br>  <br>  With all that being said, there are quite a few videos out there on how to prepare for MMA fights.  Just to list a few who've put out videos: Mark Hatmaker, Mario Sperry, Karo Parisyan, Frank Trigg, Randy Couture, Frank Shamrock, Georges St-Pierre, Pat Miletich, Dan Henderson, the Singer brothers, the Rua brothers, Denis Kang, Jens Pulver, Bas Rutten, Josh Barnett, and Erik Paulson.  I'm sure I'm forgetting a few guys.  Some of these videos or series try to be all-encompasing, some focus on one aspect or another of MMA (ground and pound, takedowns, leg locks, etc).  It's hard to recommend one above the others, but my personal bias is towards Mark Hatmaker.  He explains things in a very clear-cut scientific manner.  He tells you how you're doing something and why you're doing it.<br>  <br>  As for high school history classes, absolutely not.  This is such a microcosm of human existance that it's only begun to make its way into college-level programs, which are more focused and in depth than anything you'll find at the high school level.|`|pwiRMmicaa	no thers no classes about it in high school which is pretty crappy but im sure if you go on youtube you could find some videos.<br>  and im sure somewhere around where you live you could find a place to actually train and try out martial arts.|`|W0NpcICwaa	try this link<br>  this is amazing -<a href="http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/?go=training.browse&l1=164" rel="nofollow">http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/?go=trai...</a>|`|9d2aOK36aa	youtube is excellent. watch as much as you can

Vjan4Vq2aa	I don't think they're ready to host any international competitions yet. Imagine the brawls in the World Cup if it were held in Spain. Did you see Germany and Argentina fight after penalties when the World Cup was in Germany in 2006? Spain would go crazy, and their fans are pretty rude.<br>  I  think England or Australia should host the World Cup in 2018, and Chicago host the 2016 Olympics.|`|IJvwYe1yaa	I want the World Cup to come to North America in 2018 but I doubt it will happen. <br>  But you know what? I agree with footballer above.  <br>  I bet all kinds of things can be said about Peter Crouch's height or they can call Rooney Shrek. Wanker or anything.  But God forbid you make monkey noises. Samuel Eto'o looks like a monkey anyways. Some monkey's are white too.  George Bush eh?  If they want to be racist than let them be racist.  If you ban them from making chants it doesn't change the fact that they're thinking it in their head. So who cares?  Just play your game. I don't know why they put corruption and racism in the same sentence as if they're equally bad. <br>  They need to focus more on the corruption and fan violence.<br>  <br>  This world needs Superman.|`|3buQDaRDaa	That is good to hear since I am in Chicago and want the olympics. Spain in a nation that is only a few decades ahead of fundamentalist muslims.|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	and still you come around and post this question, you must really be jealous that if Spain host it they have a better chance of winning it than maybe your overrated England or whatever team you support.

Always be enjoyable to watch!!<br>  Before Try-Outs<br>  1) Talk to the coach. The coach is the person who knows what he/she wants for the squad. Until you talk to the coach, you will not know exactly how to perform, or what to work on.<br>  <br>  2) Prepare in advance. Do not wait until the week before try-outs to get ready. Getting in shape for cheerleading can take quite a while. Find out the requirements far enough in advance to prepare. <br>  <br>  3) Talk to other cheerleaders. Most of the time you will find that others are just as nervous as you. Try to find a friend to work with. This will help keep both of you motivated. Plus, you will have someone you already know at try-outs! This will help calm your nerves even more.<br>  <br>  Practice Week<br>  <br>  1) Many squads have practices before actual try-outs. This allows the coach to teach everyone certain skills needed for try-outs. This is also time for the coach to evaluate how well you work with others. This is the time to make friends, while working hard. Be sure not to seclude yourself from the rest of the team. Sure, you may be competing against them soon, but they may also be your squad mates.<br>  <br>  2) Be confident in yourself. You may not think you are the best cheerleader on the court, but that is not all that counts. Sportsmanship, and a great attitude go further than may think.<br>  <br>  3) Be open to trying new things. You may have only flown during you cheerleading career, but the coach may think you have potential to be a great base. Do not take this as an insult. Most coaches want to make good all-around cheerleaders. The most versatile cheerleaders can fly and base.<br>  <br>  The Day of Try-Outs<br>  <br>  1) Be sure to get a good night sleep. You want to have all the energy possible for the judges.<br>  <br>  2) Wear your hair in a neat fashion. It does not have to be fancy, just up off your face ( ex. pony tail ).<br>  <br>  3) Wear clothes that fit. Over sized shirts make it hard to see motions. This can really hurt you, for normally they look worse over better. Make sure you are comfortable in what you wear. Nothing is worse then watching someone tug at clothing in the middle of a cheer.<br>  <br>  4) If you have time after school, (before tryouts) take a hot bath. This will help calm your nerves. If this is not possible, don't worry. There are other ways to calm down.<br>  <br>  The Actual Try-Out<br>  <br>  1) Before you are called to perform take three deep breaths. When you breath in say, "I know I can do this." and on the way out say, "I am going to do this!." Of course, this is a mental exercise.<br>  <br>  2) Enter the floor with as much enthusiasm as possible. The judges want to know you can perform, even when not doing a routine.<br>  <br>  3) Smile! This is very important in cheerleading. Make it look natural. Huge fake smiles are detected from a mile away. A judge wants to know you are actually having fun, not throwing on a plastered smile. <br>  <br>  4) Use a loud clear voice. Do not sing or chop your words. The words should be sharp and clear. Be sure to pronounce Ts, and Rs. Go Fight Win Should sound like three separate words.<br>  <br>  5) Use expression in your voice. Sounding like a robot is not going to cut it at many try-outs. A monotone voice is not pleasing to the audience or judges. <br>  <br>  6) If you are not sure what the judges are asking you to do, then say so. A simple "Can you please explain that again?" is usually fine. Judges want you to do the best you can. That way they know they are judging your real talent.<br>  <br>  7) If you make a mistake move on. Do not giggle, fuss, or get embarrassed. It is okay to make mistakes. Everyone does it. It is how you handle it that counts. Judges want to know that a mistake does not rattle you. What judges, or other cheerleaders see, the average viewer will not see unless a scene is made. Plus, sometimes judges may not even pick up on a mistake.<br>  <br>  8) If the judges ask you to do a skill over again, it does not mean that it was bad. Sometimes a judge misses something, or was not sure if what they saw was correct. Do not take this as a bad thing.<br>  <br>  9) If you feel you did not do a jump (or do any skill) the best you could. Or really messed it up. It is ok to ask for a another attempt. Judges know that not everything is hit perfectly. Normally they will allow a re-try. *Note-This does not mean all judges allow re-tries.<br>  <br>  10) Leave with a smile on your face. You are not any worse off by trying out. Wither you make it or not, you should feel good about trying. If you did not try-out, you would not be on the team anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember...<br>  <br>  To try sucking lemons beforehand (gives you great facial expressions.)<br>  To keep your motions sharps quick!<br>  To read the grading sample below it words to live by.|`|13ea41be1ed273ced19b63d4ecc61592aa	Okay girl here's the break down.<br>  Typical jumps that you'll need are:<br>  Toe Touch<br>  Right/Left Herkie<br>  Right/Left Hurdler<br>  Pike <br>  Double 9 (just to show off)<br>  Here are the break downs for the jumps (try them on trampoline and keep those toes pointed,even if they aren't that high just keep the pointed,makes jumps look clean)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm</a><br>  <br>  If you have time sign up for tumbling classes to learn a basic round off back hand spring.

Kobe could not carry a team out of the first round without a second superstar and a lot of legit NBA starters. Wade has also yet to do it. T- Mac, yet to do it etc... As a player I'm not going to lay everything out there every night when I know the owners and guys in the front office are not dedicated to winning. Which was the situation in Toronto.

evWSROsXaa	Absolutey. <br>  In volleyball, you're constantly running while squating, which will more than work your legs, butt, back, abs, etc. The way you hit the back will be great excersice for your arms. People don't realize that there is lots of cardio involved in volleyball, and you will see once you get in there.<br>  Of course you will stretch and do reps before hand. Our coaches, even if we came in late for practice would make us stretch. Safety first!|`|749a6586e68d3ab356d776176fd57b63aa	I loved volleyball( I'm sooooo out of shape for it now) If you can commit to what they ask,go for it.Just get your dig,set,and spike in order,to dominate the court!|`|aPlYt8uFaa	If you really work hard when you are playing, volleyball is a sport that you can really work up a sweat in!

So I'd probably read every thing relevant to the rape case, leave a few comments on message boards about it then ask myself weather or not he actually believe the rape accusations.  After I answered that question for myself, I'd probably post it on a few more message boards.<br>  <br>  Whatever I thought about the case, I wouldn't assume I knew the absolute answer and it wouldn't change my opinion about the player as an athlete.  For example, maybe Kobe raped that girl and maybe he didn't.  The only people who truly know are Kobe and the girl. Either way, he's a great basketball player I like to watch play.  The same is true for an athlete like Mike Vick.  He admitted to operating a dog fighting operation, but I still think he was a unique talent that made football more entertaining.  And after he's done his jail time, I think he should be allowed to resume his plaing career.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Nathan Nice,<br>  <br>  An accusation is an accusation and deserves to be examined for what it is.  <br>  <br>  Whoever the player is - rape is bigger than the game of basketball.  If someone rapes someone they deserve the punsihment of the crime.  <br>  <br>  In terms of adultery- it's wrong- and i think that it would cause me to lose a great deal of respect for that player- although it is such a common thing in the NBA (i mean you have a lot of players who have babies with multiple mothers- and are unfaithful husbands) that you hope that couples can work that out- and families can stay together-- and ultimately the issue to the player shouldn't be how his public image is affected or whether fans can forgive him- but how the spouse that was cheated on was affected by it and whether the spouse can forgive him- and whether he learns the lesson and stays faithful to his spouse. <br>  <br>  Nickster|`|DNkavhfBaa	I WOULD GO ON YAHOO ANSWERS,DAY AND NIGHT.OPEN SEVERAL ACCTS.,VOTE MYSELF BEST ANSWER 1,700 TIMES,GET ALL OF THE PEEPS I KNOW TO VOTE ME BEST ANSWER,THEN IN 5 MONTHS HAVE MORE POINTS IN THE HOOPS SECTION THAN ANYONE EVER!

1uNK9Ntdaa	I am not 100% sure if there is a penalty or not but what good would it do for execs to talk to college athletes? Anyone that is not a senior or has not declared for the draft really is no concern. Its not lik High school where the student athlete chooses a school, in the NFL the team chooses the player.|`|BFCdEAOBaa	No, under NFL rules a potential player must be at least 21 years of age by his first NFL game so talking to them earlier is a waste of time since a multitude of things could happen to the player before eligibility (ie) injury or personal problems.<br>  <br>  Many of the players who leave early attended a Prep school, Junior College or Red Shirted right out of high school first so by their junior year they are 20 going on 21. Second NCAA has strict guidelines regarding agents and pro scouts, any contact makes them quasi professionals and no longer amatures. <br>  <br>  Plus NFL teams must draft first, so they never know what players will be available to them prior to draft day any way.<br>  <br>  But in reality....Pro scouts find ways to get to players if they think it's worth it (ie) relatives, siblings, girlfriends, best friends these people are fair game to agents and pro scouts.<br>  <br>  Take Care!

Though he could be one of the best for South Africa.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yeah he is|`|AA12027343	Oh, yes, siree...he is definitely one of the greatest all-rounders ever...Mind you, though...I'm only talking about all-rounders here.<br>  His batting is amazing, as everyone knows, and his stats speak for himself...but I feel there were many batsmen greater than him...<br>  I'd say he is in the top 10 or 15 in the list of the greatest batsmen ever, but in the all-rounders list, he might just be in the top 5, I think!!<br>  At one point of time, and until the emergence of Andrew Flintoff, he was by "some distance the leading allrounder in the world game, capable of swinging the ball sharply at surprising pace off a relaxed run-up.<br>  He is one of the most patient batsmen I've ever seen, and he never gets frustrated by the slow ticking of the score-board.<br>  I think Sobers, Dev and Hadlee were in a different league altogether...but then again, maybe I'm only prejudiced thus because they were from the golden era of cricket...Somehow one just can't compare the old cricketing greats with the newer ones.<br>  It's like comparing tea and coffee : They're so much the same, but they're still so different....Plus, you love them both, but you can't decide which one's better.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	Yeah,he is one of the greatest cricketers in the world.<br>  He is the second most effective all-rounder of all time,he is just after gary sobers .<br>  I think he must be in the top 15 in test cricket ranking of all time and probably the best player ever produced by the south-african's .|`|i8QoeiNyaa	There is absolutely no doubt about it. He is one of the greatest cricketers ever.<br>  <br>  As an all rounder i still rate him below the ones you mentioned.<br>  As a batsman he will definitely be in my list of top 25 batsmen of all time.<br>  <br>  Shaun Pollock for me is SA's greatest all rounder|`|AA10989721	Statistically one of the best players ever. Was not as talented as Sobers but needs to be mentioned in the same breath. A great stalwart for South Africa!|`|G0lO7djeaa	I would say  Jacques Kallis is Excellent, is this moment he can be<br>  AFTER  kapil dev Hadlee and sobers, and before then imran khan.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Yes he is and I am glad to see him playing Live through out is career.<br>  Great Man.<br>  <br>  He will be there in the list of Top 10 All-Rounder of all time.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	Yaa!!!<br>  <br>  He is a superb Allrounder!!!|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	ok,not the best!!!  but  one of the best~|`|OLtVhVObaa	He is an amazing cricketer for south africa in the feild , with the ball and also in the slips holding onto over 100 test catches<br>  <br>  he is arguble the greatest cricketer who has revolutionised the role of a number 3 batsman in cricket and also the effectiveness of someone in the top 6 who  can bowl is extremly handy in odi and even T20, his bowling role has decreased since his elbow injury but still getting thru handy overs and getting key wickets in recent aussie tour, i recon being a south african my self he is the greatest playing of the 1990's and even 2000's|`|5421VCEBaa	Kallis is the best all rounder and probably in the top 20 batsmen ever and the top 30 bowlers ever|`|29mCE3V7aa	I think Kallis will be at 10 position A/c to allronders|`|AxGw7xfJaa	Probably in the best 3 all rounders of all time.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	That is a great achievement, but he was so slow! However, I would be one of the first to congratulate him.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah, congrats on the TC|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Jacques Kallis is the greatest all rounder that I've ever seen. I wasn't born to see the likes of Sobers, Hadlee, Dev or Imran Khan. Looking at stats and past videos, I would have to place him the 3rd best allrounder in history behind Sir Garfield Sobers. He does get very defensive from time to time but no doubt a great player.

wxHmXkGOaa	Comebacks. Especially when the team is down by alot. It show that the team has alot of heart and never gave up fighting even when all hope was lost. Anybody can get blown out but not many teams can come back for a large margin of points and win a game.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	Both are satisfying in their own right.<br>  <br>  But no feeling is more gratifying and a testament of character than a hard fought comeback.  When you shut someone out, there's no doubt about who's better.  But fighting and clawing your way back to win a game really tests one's mettle.|`|9vq0oSD2aa	The Comeback.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	Out of the two, I'd say comebacks.  But the best one is the upset.  Where everybody thinks/tells you that you are going to loose.|`|1uNK9Ntdaa	only the people who have played sprts know that comeback victories are the greatest. I would rather be down 20 and win by 3, than to be up 30 the whole time.|`|IOpOEMnQaa	comebacks when u play in them the closer ur team gets to the lead the more hyped ur team gets and when u watch them they keep u on the edge of ur seat|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	1) Shutout<br>  2) Comeback<br>  3) Shootout|`|vnzSTerjaa	comebacks, shoutouts are too harsh... unless the other team deserves it :}|`|AA10380060	rather you win by 1 or 100 a win is a win|`|yikZNA7aaa	for a defense shutouts, for an offense comebacks|`|zJC18FtAaa	Comeback|`|HLzS2z9laa	comebacks, gives more confidence, making you think you can come back anytime on any team, plus they are more intensed making you feel more rewarded when you win|`|KNTofuxMaa	I would think that a comeback win would feel better.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I think that both are obviously really good wins. A shutout does a lot for the team because it lets them know how good they are. That is great for the defense and they know they can prevent teams from scoring.<br>  <br>  But I think I'm gonna go with comebacks as better feeling win. I think that comebacks really show the team what they are made of and usually require a lot of heart and resilience. Also, you have both sides of the team working together. The offense is making big plays to inch closer and closer and then finally taking the lead. Then you have the defense doing their part by preventing the opposing team from scoring.|`|yg3Pveakaa	shutouts is more of a convincing win and tells you dominated your opponent but comebacks though entertaining, can go either way because as a player you never want to be in a position to give your opponent a chance to win and comebacks is that type of win.<br>  <br>  for me shutouts..|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Wow! They are both good. But I'll have to go with comebacks, since shutouts can give a team big heads and then they screw up.|`|RS3fjNboaa	A shutout is the ultimate win.|`|gBfPkdroaa	well ive played football before and what i like btter/ feels better are comebacks.<br>  <br>  knowing that people think your gonna lose and theres still abt 3 minutes left, just feels so good to know you beat the other team..AT THEIR HOME.<br>  <br>  :)|`|bxnMQQMJaa	are you serious?? Comebacks by far. I mean, you're down the entire game, and in the end, your team pulls it out. Great feeling. A shutout is boring, unless the game is like 3-0 the entire time, and a blowout gets boring after a whilte......|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Shut-outs, that means your team is dominant and well prepared to just roll over the opposition.  Comebacks are still good, but I always ask myself, why were we down by so much?  It leaves some questions to be answered...|`|201gZ8w0aa	best win : comebacks <br>  <br>  worst loss: shutout<br>  <br>  heartbreaker loss : OT loss or comeback then loss|`|HiuNSScLaa	M.V.P (D Wade = M.V.P)<br>  is right completely|`|ABoo1doVaa	I have always felt much better after a comeback|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Shut-outs are awesome.

He's putting up nice stats on a team that doesn't get much coverage. And he got snubbed out of the ASG over David West.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Al Jefferson is most underrated|`|s1IkFOJVaa	al jeferson and danny granger|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	Andre Iguodala people really don't look at him but i have some facts for you he is one of 3 players averaging over 5 assists 5 boards and 15 points guess who the other two are lebron and wade. he plays both ways averaging a 1.7 steals a game he averages 5.3 assists 6 boards and 18 points a game. one thing that he needs to work on is his shooting and his consistency. <br>  <br>  another player that is very under rated is josh smith when you talk about the hawks everyone talks about joe johnson. they are 4th seed in the east. At the beginning of the season. when they were on their winning streak. Josh smith was playing great he got hurt they won two more games and then started losing.  he is great at playing defense needs to work on his shot on offensive but still pretty good. he is shooting 48% from the field. 15 points a game 7 boards 1 steal and 1 block to go along with 2 assists a game.|`|0iv8MHC4aa	I'd say probably big Al. Tony Parker and Ginobili are both up there. Same with Brandon Roy. Jamison plays solid every year (20, 9), but doesnt seem to get noticed...probably cause the Wiz suck.

BK1GjPT6aa	Yes. You'll have better control of your rig ( bait/lure) and able to get the angle needed to pull up any big fish you may catch near  or on the bottom. IF you can go up to 12 foot, that'll be better but that's just me. ~good luck catchin'.|`|amlmhoUuaa	It depends on what you are fishing for.  Personally I think that a 9' rod is too long. I wouldn't use anything over a 7 1/2' rod they work great for all types of techniques and presentations.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	when i inlet fish i use a 6ft rod for bottom fish like tog and seabass.<br>  for stripers and blues i use a 11ft rod|`|m6YWglFmaa	It depends on what you are doing, are you bait casting or casting lures.  If you are bait casting or dunking as it is called some times in Hawaii, then yes your surf rod is good enough, but it also makes a difference on how far you want to pitch the bait, the longer the pole the farther you can throw it.  If you are casting a lure or whipping as it is called in Hawaii as well, then that is a totally different thing and would call for a smaller yet just as long as your surf rod for greater distance in casting out your lure. It also makes a difference in the line weight and if you are using a floater or a sinker to drag the lure under the top of the water.<br>  So you will need to know what kind of fishing you are going to be doing to make up your mind on which type of pole you should use.<br>  Sorry I can't give you a better answer than that, but if it were me I would take both poles and both of them to use, dunk one and whip the other one in a different place but close enough to grab me big pole when it goes off.<br>  Good luck to you and Keep your line high and tight....peace....|`|PZIqJyctaa	what are you fishing for?
WxmNSxNGaa	Get those Mr Clean Magic Erasers from the supermarket. Cut it into one inch strips. Soak it with alcohol (rubbing alcohol is fine, but the higher the concentration the better, do NOT use water) and rub the cue clean with it. Make sure you grip the Magic Eraser with rubber dish gloves or something so you don't get alcohol all over your hands. This will get almost all the crap off your cue. After it's clean, rub it down with a towel to make sure it's dry and burnish it (rub it to make it smooth) with either a piece of un-dyed leather or one of the many burnishing products on the market designed for pool cues.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Alcohol will NOT dry the wood out (even though taking moisture out of the wood is much better than adding any, but I digress), and it's not like you'd be dousing the shaft in it. You use the alcohol to wet the Eraser, that's it. And putting lighter fluid on your cue is the single dumbest thing I've ever heard. And never, ever use water to clean your cue. Ever.|`|y5TTkgFYaa	I use alcohol on my predator shaft all the time to clean it, and it works great.  You can also use micro paper (very fine sandpaper) if its really dirty.  If you take your cue to a cue maker to have it cleaned they are going to do the same thing.  They will be able to put that finish back on too.  Personally I hate that finish because its too sticky, so always take it off and just burnish the shaft.|`|B2eGb9ZEaa	Lighter fluid and a clean cloth I hear will take all the chalk and gunk off the shaft and it has a little bit of oil in it the treat the wood. Alcohol will dry the wood out and any water will make the wood warp.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	I have used rubbing alcohol. It never made the color change.|`|m6YWglFmaa	Pledge, spray it on a cloth and then rub the cue with it until it is clean, it will also make the cue slide easier when you hold it making it easier to shoot a game.<br>  Hope that helps....peace....cya....|`|RGieBkTqaa	I would just use a little bit of wood polish with a soft duster cloth i use a dust cloth on my cue and it works a charm :)|`|tpubt16Aaa	Just a tip. Stay away from bristle brushes, and remember it is easier to clean the pole than to clean inside the holes.|`|oy1xeBMCaa	nnn|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Baby wipes or water works.
KDOIKIq2aa	Can you yes.  However it would be hard if the shop class is in school.  You need to fit the stock with the action and barrel to build it right.  You could always bring the factory stock in and work from it, but you still need to fit it.<br>  <br>  As for making it.  You'll need a saw to cut the blank.  Thumbhole stock you'll need a drill.  From there most then could be done with hand tools, but you'll find a rotary tool very helpful.  If only working an hour a day it will take a lot of time.|`|yskbjvT1aa	In the old days of my youth you could not only make one but your shop teacher would probably have you make him one if you turned out a good one. B+ grade or better. I made little single barrel .22 cal derringers in my Metal Shop and sold a half a dozen of them before someone dropped his out of his pocket in a class room. No we did not go to jail. But the sloppy pocket kid had his .22 confiscated and the shop teacher shut down my little gun manufacturing plant. (this was in the Junior year of High School) Then the next school year I was in wood shop and was busily making a stock for a cross bow. I even made the trigger mechanism out of wood too. At that point the wood shop teacher stopped my production schedule and I had to finish it up at home. Evidently he had been tipped off by the metal shop teacher to watch me. But I will give my instructors credit as they did me. Both of them graded my efforts (the gun and the cross bow) and I got some of my few 'A' grades in shop classes for those projects.|`|d06cab42016bd85292d8c35998cc1551aa	Actually, I'd have a conversation with the shop teacher before I tried it.   According to the article I'll list as a source, a girl in Colorado recently was expelled from her school because she had fake rifles that were used by a young marine drill team in her vehicle.  Your best bet might be to try and do it at home, You could probably buy all the tools you need to do it from a walmart for under $100

Do yoga. Workout. Anything helps in becoming more flexible and lean. <br>  <br>  Don't wear baggy clothes to try-outs, but don't dress skimpy either. A fitted t-shirt of tank top with some semi-short shorts would work fine. Make sure your hair is up in a ponytail, and your bangs (if you have them) are pinned back. <br>  <br>  Find a friend at your high school (that is/was a cheerleader RECENTLY) to help you with cheers/dances/tumbles. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you do those things, you have an excellent chance at making it. <br>  I believe in you, girl. <br>  <br>  :-)

apY85Qmtaa	This was the downfall of the Lakers in 2004 against the Pistons and this may be the downfall of the Lakers this playoffs.

Tonight they're not going in, but that's not going to stop him from jacking them up.<br>  <br>  Kobe has reverted back to his shooter mentality, which is what killed the Lakers in the playoffs in previous years.  He's totally convinced that his next shot will start some 11 of 12 run that will bring his team back into the game.|`|VvsngpFhaa	Lol? Kobe is the team :) One game doesn't define his ability, who needs to pass when he's capable of scoring 40 points on any team? ;) An off game doesn't say much, everyone has it, wait till next game when he puts 30 at half and you'll ask why Kobe's so good :DD|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Doesnt matter Lakers will win this year you just watch, one game who cares we still ahead.|`|hIBNTsy3aa	thats easy...his ego is too fragile....he demands points and shots...its in his contract|`|6SsSjqFTaa	Because Kobe is the best player in the game right now.

KYaM65gzaa	The Bulls will definitely be in the playoffs, don't worry about that. They played a heck of a game today too especially Gordon Wade was jsut a little bit better than he was though, that being said playin 50 minutes without getting called for a foul and being permitted to travel on the game winner kinda makes his job a little easier.<br>  <br>  As for the Bulls, they couldn't really have done anything better, but the fact no-one had more than 3 assists is a bit worrying. They played well, had two great games coming in, overall the last three games have been very good for the Bulls they are starting to click with the new vets from sactown and starting to find some rythym.|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Have faith we have a better team after the trade. A good off-season training camp will help the team achieve stability. Bulls showed a lotta fight in them almost beating the Heat in regulation. The Bulls are bound to get better. I think right now the 8th seed is the most accurate projection but I don't doubt them getting to the 7th seed at all.<br>  <br>  Go Bulls!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|DiAujdC1aa	The Bulls definitely have the talent to win a lot of games.

oSakZ1asaa	No Gamo gets 1,000 fps with lead. Some Gamos get 1,100 with alloy. Gamo has great marketing, so-so delivery. The CFX is much more accurate than the big cat. Between the CFX and the RWS 34, from the factory, about the same. I own the RWS 34 and have returned a Gamo CFX. A reworked CFX might compare to a fixed barrel an RWS 48 and cost the same, but an RWS can be reworked too. Why start out with an inferior platform?|`|4mb6xaxBaa	the cfx is a better gun, but for $200 a rws 34 comes with a lifetime warrenty and better gun!
Vw0ry8Ylaa	Well, there are a lot of variables, like what lures you're talking about, what you're fishing for, and where you're fishing, but the short answer is, yes, smaller lures will handle better with lighter lines and poles. <br>  <br>  Think of the extremes -- if you use a very heavy pole, very heavy line, and a little tiny lure, that lure's not going to cast anywhere and you're not going to feel the response of it in your hands anyway. If you use a light pole, light line, and a big giant lure, you're going to bend the rod down by just retrieving the lure, and you might snap off your top guide whipping it around.<br>  <br>  Match your pole to your lure and the fish you're going after. I don't know what kind of outfit this 5.5-foot pole is, but it sounds like it will be just right for around 4-pound line and lures that are 1 ounce and smaller. Some lures even come with line and rod weight recommendations. Inexperienced anglers often want to use heavier line so they don't lose fish, but once you learn how to properly use your drag you'll want to have the lightest and highest quality line you can get -- it will cast longer and more accurately. Then use tactics, not line test strength, to bring the fish to hand.|`|7royFhIgaa	Sure, I use 4 lb line on my ultra light rods with small lures or jigs.|`|amlmhoUuaa	Yeah, lighter lines work better for smaller lures.  you just can't cast smaller lures as well with bigger tackle|`|KJWxqQHiaa	VERY small lures have to have light line, and short rod, or your not getting them anywhere. I fished a light-action rod/reel a couple days ago with some kind of panfish soft-plastic minnow, and i couldn't cast it, at all. I fished a pop-eye jig which is 1/16 oz. and could hardly cast it. Yes, you cannot cast small lures AT ALL with larger rods or reels.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Short, simple, and to the point.|`|CBTAgeu4aa	I always use the light action set ups for my small lures with 6 pound line.|`|GxGsJixoaa	the lighter the line the farther it casts and sinks. i do a lot of fishing for trout in WNY and the Addirondacks. i have a 5ft st crox with 2lb test for brook trout, and in areas where i know that the trout are only 5-8 inches.(don't get me wrong there are always some that got very big in these areas) but when i fish the asuable and saranac i have a 5'8" with 6lb and have done well with spinners and small spoons. when i fish for trout and steelhead coming out of lake erie in the Catt i use a 6'8" pool with 10-14lb test. there i use 1/4-1 oz spoons and egg sacs. so it all depends on what you fishing for, the type of bait, the terrain, size of the fish you think your going to catch, and amount of snags there are.

I had the Sumo2 for a year and it actually revamped my drive.  Went from the 275 yd range back close to the 290 yd range.  Broke my Sumo2 shaft so my local golf store let me borrow the Sumo 5900 until mine was replaced.  It hit just as well but has a better look to it with it's rough crown.  Tried the King Cobra but they all seemed to have a much louder "ting" which got pretty annoy after a couple swings but some people like that.  The Sumos have a loud "ting" but not nearly what the Cobra had.

MmArhDgsaa	Save your money on that knife, they are cheap junk knives. Remember you get what you pay for. I have several "survival" knives. All the Rambos (collectible) but I wouldn't take them in the field. Unless I had a real LILE one, mine are copies. Nice to look at and feel but thats it. Sure they will cut you and slice and dice you but not good in the field. For heavy chopping look for a older Buckmaster 184, you will not beak it. Also the 184 has a hollow handle you are looking for. Or a Gerber BMF / LMF knife. Those are two that will not let you down. Take a pocket knife with you all the time. A large survival knife is lousy for skinning a rabbit or gutting a fish. Sure you can tie it to a stick and kill a wild boar and all that but you will be smart to go after a rabbit or bird to live on in the wild. If it comes to that.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Hollow handled knives aren't worth a damn!<br>  <br>  Ever hear of a fanny pack, or even better a back pack?<br>  <br>  No way in hell can you pack enough gear in the handle of a knife for a person to "do everything."<br>  <br>  If you want a good survival kit, spend $50-.00 to $100.00 on a good knife from a reputable maker such as Buck, K-Bar, Cold Steel, or Benchmade.  It won't have a hollow handle, and it won't have a saw back.<br>  <br>  (FWIW, sawbacks on a knife are either totally useless because they blade is too wide for the teeth to cut, or the blade it thin enough for the saw to work which makes it too thin and breakable for real knife work.)<br>  <br>  After you get your knife, assemble a survival kit.  You can do a bare bones kit in a fanny pack.  You can fit a small first aid kit, a good compass, area maps, matches, tri-ox tablets or fire-starterr cubes, some toilet paper, fish hooks, line and a few lures, a wire saw, some needles and thread, a couple of space blankets, a poncho, a few granola bars, and some water purification tablets.<br>  <br>  If you step up to a backpack you can add some real food in the form of MRE's or jerky, flares, and emergency radiohand-crankeded) a small tarp and some rope to make a shelter, a good hatchet, some dry socks, and maybe a change of clothes.<br>  <br>  Those are survival kits, and they won't fit into a knife handle|`|Z8UV6S3baa	From the photo that looks like a United Cutlery replica of the current US bayonet. At best it has 420 stainless steel in the blade, and the grind is going to be formed such that it will not cut terribly well unless you spend alot of time with a file and stone.<br>  <br>  This kind of design has some really inherent limitations in strength and performance which means that a knife you would really be willing to trust your life to is going to cost something like 10x what this one does.<br>  <br>  You would be better off finding a good waterproof belt pouch for $10 or $15 to put your own survival kit in, and then look around for a full tang large knife from a more reputable manufacturer.

Look them up, there not the best but if cash is a issue then they have great knives.

1a4f8OD1aa	im not a lsu fan but i would like to see them make a run. but i think they are going to make it to the second round|`|AA12068233	Sweet 16|`|C9r94iTmaa	I think they will win the SEC tourny.  I think they will lose in the 2nd round.
O3TuQZItaa	Sell it on an online auction site. My personal fav is gunbroker.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here is one that is selling, it will most likely sell for more than the current bid.<br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124558832" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <br>  I would put your gun out at about 650. It will sell.<br>  <br>  The one question that you most likely are asking is how to transfer the gun to the new owner. There are two different types of buyers on these web sites. There are FFL dealers looking to add to their stock of guns, and there are non dealers. If the buyer is an FFL dealer, you just ship the gun to them, after you get your money. If the buyer is not a dealer, they will give you the info as to which FFL dealer they want to handle the transaction, and you ship it to that dealer. In either case, you need to have the dealer send you a copy of their 01 FFL license, and you send the gun to the address on the license.|`|OF64jyPSaa	trade it for something of equal value|`|kyqlr606aa	I recommend you take it to a dealer (even the same dealer you bought it from) and ask what they'll give you for it.  You'll likely be very shocked how little they will shell out for a used gun.  Some of them offer to sell guns on commission but the fee cuts into your profits.  <br>  <br>  The state police in your area should be able to tell you what the legal requirements are for private sales.  You'd make the most selling it outright or as Charles suggested, trading for something you do like.|`|Pp3WHtSFaa	GunBroker.com is the best auction site to sell it on but it will cost money to post it and sell it. Either way use Gunbroker.com to get an idea of the Value/going rate.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite way is to use forums like AR15.com (Equipment Exchange Section) and HKpro.com. HKpro.com will probably be your best bet and the feedback for users that will buy is always readily available on both sites.<br>  <br>  If you want to sell it soon and Face to Face you will most likely take a loss unless you sell it in a newspaper or other simular local classifieds. we have oregonlive.com in oregon for selling such items and that site works well for us.<br>  <br>  good luck
zJC18FtAaa	Ill be your first opponent|`|AA10069553	Some states require you to be 18 to get a license (Illinois for example). Join a gym (there shouldn't be an age limit for that) and work out there. Then your partners or trainer can hook you up with someone that can get you into a fight. That's a big part of competing in MMA, connections.|`|213fgac7aa	you can join an MMA club at any age but it's illegal for you to fight unless ur 18|`|VfbsGjYSaa	You should join a MMA gym. There probably isn't an exact age limit. When your coaches think you are ready and you get a match then that is how you start. Also, stop typing in all caps.
PtyXfg5Aaa	definitely yamaha|`|ZXhX78wsaa	Yamaha! :D|`|ZxUL3wFXaa	YAMAHA r15 will easily win the race|`|zpOSz6gXaa	the best driver the vechile has nothhing to do wit it
CL040gRjaa	The K2 Darkstar is a really nice freestyle board. It has a true twin shape which makes it easier to ride and land fakie than a directionally shaped board. The Darkstar also has a sintered base which should make the board faster than an extruded base, since sintered bases are more porous and hold wax better. This is a very good setup : )<br>  <br>  With your height and weight, I would either get the 155cm or 157cm board. The lowest size the Darkstar comes in is 152cm, and that would be too short for you. The wide version of the Darkstar comes in 154cm, if you wanted to go a little shorter than 155cm.|`|p3qMXuPGaa	Check out the 153.  The darkstar is designed as a board for someone that can handle it all from park to pow.  The sidecut on it allows for extreme carve ability and the flex pattern is pretty solid for popping and riding just about any type of terrain.|`|el007rWxaa	if you ride park go with the 152<br>  all mountain 154 or 155 whatever it is
kX8e0ASEaa	if youre training for matches I suggest you go with 16oz as it is higher than the actual gloves you use in a real match.  <br>  <br>  As for where to get them I would check out Rival.com.  Gloves are great and reasonably priced.  I suggest a vecro strap glove as tying them constantly is a big waste of time.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|nFg5iqOLaa	A 14 OZ MAN TRUST ME TESE PEPLE NEVER BOXED BUT I DO IF YO GOT SMALL HANDS GET 12  MEDUIM HADS 14 BIG HANDS 16 OZ GLOVES =]|`|a4c7XSWHaa	16 oz. cause the gloves youll be fighting with will be like 10 oz.
eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	jefferson is one of the top 2 centers in the league, along with howard. both are very young and very talented young big men that can make true statements in the future. yao ming is pathetic. you would think he could dominate the NBA with 40points and 20rebounds a game, but that fool is as soft as Gasol.|`|b2qdwABVaa	Yao is a fadeaway jump shooting Center.  Al Jefferson has a lot more post moves and will bang with the defender in the low post.  Yao is more likely to shoot over everyone cuz of his height.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Al Jefferson<br>  <br>  Yao is kind of soft center,Jefferson has many tricks around the basket|`|BFOOOzwBaa	1. dwight<br>  2.shaq<br>  3.al<br>  yao is leaking blood and the sharks are comin|`|bcdda81b9d8d3b625f85a27ddaee6592aa	Al all the way|`|JV2mxI75aa	yao has the better game but AI gets more rebounds|`|d9j0pkSJaa	al jeff u c dat guy? hes a ******* beast down low much like ur mom|`|fuYYRJXtaa	I'd call it a tie.  Al Jefferson in my opinion is very Underrated and is the 3rd best Center in the NBA behind Dwight & Yao.  This dude is so big, strong, talented and he dominates on both sides of the court.  When the Timberwolves played the Rockets earlier this season.. Jefferson man-handled Yao in the 1st quarter, and there was no answer.  He ended up scoring 36 on the night.  The dude is a beast! Sad to see him get injured for the season.<br>  <br>  1. Dwight Howard<br>  2. Yao Ming<br>  3. Al Jefferson|`|s1IkFOJVaa	dwight howard shaq and al jeferson
yererDcnaa	team A definitely gets the better side of this deal. they get two solid pitchers, a solid offensive play, and quinten who has the potential of being a solid player.<br>  <br>  although team B gets ramirez and nady, thats not enough to make up for the pitching they are giving away in the deal|`|sJznih8raa	it depends...team A is getting two outfielders and two starting pitchers. does team A have room to even start these players?<br>  <br>  team b i think gets an all-around solid deal<br>  <br>  but like i said, it depends on who else is on the rosters|`|OXHLqBuwaa	Sucky trade for team B|`|zJC18FtAaa	Team B is the dumbest person ever
KYaM65gzaa	I KNOW they're rigged. Ask yourself this: Would Zaza have got suspended if it was he that  shoved that ref instead of Garnett? Absolutely, for the rest of the playoffs. Garnett gets off because Stern wants Celts in the finals. He even SAID during the season he wanted Celts-Lakers final. A Commish playin faouvrites? He also allowed the foul on Brent Barry's three-pointer (don't tell me Kobe wouldn't have got that call), allowed a dodgy trade for Gasol, got the refs to give Miami the 2006 finals because he hates Cuban. It's a business not a game anymore. Celts-Lakers makes more money. It's disgusting but it's true that at least some of the games (those that affect money) are rigged. He won't dip his finger into Denver-Portland or anything like that, but if one of them is in position to knock out the Lakers, then expect some suss calls to go LA's way.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Indeed<br>  and the Refs are part of it|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Of course they are.  How else do you explain the Spurs winning four rings?  The Spurs draw huge ratings, they're the most popular team in America... league officials love the bright lights and excitement of San Antonio, and it's a celebrity mecca.  The Spurs obviously aren't winning on talent, so there must be something fishy up.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Of course not, team works hard and win title. Everybody thought Mavs will win at 06 final, Heat won instead. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mavs were better in 07 yr 67 wins, then and lost 1RD 4-2 series for GS.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I disagree with others.<br>  <br>  <br>  NBA not setup|`|WfEol5xkaa	Duh.|`|dnQjc3Khaa	umm no
NpqAbZqpaa	I bought two, they each broke on the first swing..<br>  <br>  You should see the other guy though... :)
jSkHquK5aa	Physical education has existed since the earliest stages of humanity, in areas as simple the transmission of knowledge of basic survival skills, such as hunting. However, the real history of physical education is in the changing methodologies used to transmit physical skills and, to a lesser extent, the varying intentions of the educator.<br>  <br>  The first known literary reference to an athletic competition is preserved in the ancient Greek text, the Iliad, by Homer.[2] While by no means is this the beginning of physical activity, it marks an important point in the study of the history of physical education. Other cultures that existed before the Greeks, including the ancient Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian civilizations had traditions of physical education and activity, but the Greek influence is argued to be the most fundamental to how the discipline is viewed today.[3] The ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic Games, which originated in the early 8th century BC, even continues today.<br>  <br>  The rate of participation in physical activity by American adolscents has decreased dramatically over the last decade.|`|WbUrwR2Haa	Oh NOOOOOOO!!!!!<br>  <br>  get in shape and quit complaining.<br>  <br>  i can run 10 miles without stopping<br>  <br>  1 mile is like the warm up to my warmup to my stretching|`|82MzhqHRaa	Haha somebody realized americans were fat and invented PE to try and burn some of that fat. Personally i loved PE. The only class i looked forward to every 2 days. So i can kick some *** in b-ball|`|IJvwYe1yaa	P.E. was my favourite class in High School.  Stop whining. Turn that mush into muscle! :p<br>  I think running a mile every week would do you good.
yikZNA7aaa	Manning is the top QB in the NFL, hands down. He reads the defense at the line and calls the plays from that. What other QB can do that? What other QB an come back from knee surgery in JUly and lead his team to 9 straight wins? If he had played in his last game in 2004, he would have the single season record for TD passes because he had 49 in 15 games since the Colts rested him after one drive in the last game as is customary for them. Anyway, he's ld his team to I think it's 6 straight 12 win seasons now? It might be seven. Who else has done that? no one. True he doesn't have multiple rings, but he's never had a truely acceptable defense. By the time he retires, Manning may also hold nearly every passing record that Farve just broke, it just depends on how long he wants to play.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And Phillip Rivers is statistically? what? ok keep thinking that. when he puts up 9 years of 4,000 yards and consistently tosses 25-30 TD's we'll talk|`|jTKxLFuWaa	Rivers is good throwing deep balls and reading one-on-one coverages down field. Imo, that's all the honorable mention he has over Peyton. But he got the starting job over Drew Brees, who leads the modern day NFL with the most passing yards, which proves he can throw better footballs.<br>  <br>  But above all, I believe Peyton Manning is the smartest QB in the league today|`|wxHmXkGOaa	Tom Brady is the best QB in the league when healthy. You seen what he can do when you give him weapons to work with. Manning always had Marvin and Reggie to throw to and only got one superbowl out of it. Brady had guys like Branch and Brown and won 3 outta 4 superbowl in that span. Manning is a great QB, but he is not better then Tom.|`|FNYmdowwaa	Thats a contreversal statement. He is very good, but i dont think he is best in the nfl. But when i think about it i cant think of any1 in the nfl right now who can match up with him. I want to say drew brees or jay cutler, but idk. Kurt Warner is also up there in rankings, they both are very smart qbs.|`|HnLLy8wHaa	He's good, but he isn't the best. Definitely in the top three though, and he's by far the smartest qb in the league.<br>  <br>  As for the number one spot, I'd have to give the nod to Rivers.|`|1uNK9Ntdaa	Brady is the best QB hands down. No one can name 3 WRs he had during his 3 superbowls..........go ahead, I will wait. And if you look it up then you are only lying to yourself.|`|hdFMLVF7aa	Depends on how you define best.  If its rings, then its Brady, if you think stats are what determine the best, then its Manning.  But I'm going to say Brady.|`|GUjr6whNaa	Not THE best in the NFL but definitely in the top 3|`|wTzXUfRXaa	HELL NO JEFF GARCIA IS HE JUST NEEDS AN OFFENSE|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Whem it's all said and done, Peyton Manning will likely have most passing record and be widely regarded as the greatest QB ever.  If you don't believe me, check his stats and winning percentage and compare them to any other Q. He's beena winner with a Super Bowl ring .  Barring some type of major injury, people wil be able to look at his production and have no choice to proclaim him the greatest.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He can be.  Its close, and when you talk about Manning (only Peyton) Brady, Rivers, Brees, you can really make a case for any of them being the best.|`|yg3Pveakaa	I think he is but he cannot lead his team the way Brady is doing for the Pats..He can have all his accolades but his team cannot win another SB.|`|AA10623334	IN THE AFC...NOT NFL|`|lu4ufhm5aa	Nope.. sorry. Rivers.. all the way.|`|a7bfee8f94afdfd3ac16e448849ea19faa	no, third string for the lions is obviously the best.|`|fLF2VM8uaa	The only two people you can argue MIGHT be better are McNabb (which in my opinion is a weak arguement), and Brady. Brady is a great QB but I think Manning is better.|`|AA10380060	yes, he like one of the people above me said calls his plays at the line of scrimmage. and yes he only has one ring but other than bob sanders and dwight freeney who do the colts have on defense?|`|zJC18FtAaa	Yes he is and has been for years. Even without his great receivers he'd be putting up good numbers.<br>  <br>  Whabtbob it's an opinion not a statement|`|mXQYbFiiaa	I think he is whether Brady's healthy or not<br>  <br>  Peyton<br>  Roethlisberger<br>  Brady<br>  Brees<br>  Rivers|`|BlgZmV6uaa	I will agree consistantly good.|`|vnzSTerjaa	yea... NO, philip rivers is statistically|`|e6699b2a01c30ec3067a7a71acd9c2d2aa	Yes i think his the best in 10 yrs. and in the top 10 all-time<br>  aaron rodgers does not compare,rivers in top 100|`|YlBLz9lTaa	its a toss up between him and brady
huQzSXKAaa	Pebble Beach, maybe?|`|yk4S7uuraa	Pudge claims the Mets and Marlins have talked to him, but the Mets say, they are done with any free agent signings and their catching is set.|`|utTFiz3gaa	According to Pudge himself, the Marlins are interested.|`|yererDcnaa	not really sure, but after the show he put on yesterday in the WBC i am sure quite a few ball clubs are interested as of now.<br>  <br>  he proved he is able to hit and run|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	marlins could be interested
yikZNA7aaa	they'll do well. The Saints and Panthers will be hard to compete with next year, but they'll find a way. Matt Ryan will NOT be better than Peyton Manning I'm sorry to say,b tu you jusrt can't put those type of expectations or promises out there after one solid year. Can he be on Manning and Brady's level? Yes. But, we have to wait and see. Roddy White is good, but he reminds me of Terrell Owens the way he drops passes. I mean obviously he's good, but can you count on him in the clutch. To sum it up, the Falcons will compete in 2009, but I don't think they can beat the Panthers for the NFC South crown.|`|ULw1777caa	Yes they can.  Good coach, good offense.  They will be fine this year.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Easily.  There's really no competition in the South.  The Panthers have been going downhill, and with Peppers wanting out, they're not going to be the same.  Tampa will be lucky to win 4 games this year, and the Saints won't be much better.<br>  <br>  They also have a very good core.  Ryan looked really good as a rookie last season.  I'm not saying he's going to be better than Manning, but if you compare, he had a rating of 87.7, 3440 yards and only 11 picks.  Manning in his rookie year, he had a 71.2 rating, 3739 yards, and 28 picks, more picks than TDs.  Manning's first 5 years he had more picks than Ryan had last year.  Thats encouraging enough.  He has a good running game as well, and decent recievers.  The defense could be a little better, but thats what the draft is for.|`|AA10623334	NO SO FIND A NEW TEAM.|`|e6699b2a01c30ec3067a7a71acd9c2d2aa	yes,they got a solid offense good WR,RB,QB if they get defense i may see a NFC championship|`|vnzSTerjaa	hellz yea, as long as they got matt ice and micheal turner *weeps* i miss him on the chargers :'[|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Matt Ryan WILL be better then Peyton Manning.  His first NFL pass was a touchdown.  He is destined for greatness.  Michael Turner is the 2nd best RB in the NFC behind AP and they have Roddy White.  They lost a ton of playmakers on defense and havn't really filled any holes so I would worry about the defensive side of the ball.|`|1n5E6ensaa	I like Matt Ryan alot, but I think they overachieved last year and will take a step back in the NFC South. I think they benefited from a weak schedule and caught teams off guard for much of the season. Nobody is going to overlook Ryan, Turner and White next year. Plus I think the Saints and Panthers are very good teams, and they have to play each twice. My prediction... 8-8 or 7-9|`|usxlWfm8aa	i'll be honest with you if matt ryan and that running game can stay good and healthy they can beat anybody. but if they don't get a better secondary they won't ever win a championship truthfully!|`|oNlD36RAaa	Not to be a jerk but, the grammatically correct version of your question is "will the atlanta falcons do WELL in 2009?"<br>  Sorry, it was just bothering me.|`|cPc2Q6MHaa	I think so.  I think the Panthers overachieved last year so the division should be there for the taking. <br>  <br>  I predict 9-7 or 10-6 and making the playoffs again.

If we are interested in having you come sing the anthem, one our Entertainment Department staff will contact you for a live audition. "|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Umm...they usually have a "Home Team Singer". They don't really have guest singers...at least not at Wings games. But if that isn't the case in Colorado then go on nhl.com, find the Av's website, get a phone number and give them a call. Ask if you can audition to sing the National Anthem and see what they say.|`|e86b48762b2bf24db34ec84c67e6663baa	I wish you luck with that and do hope to one day hear you sing at a game. I think "smlaxer2" may have your answer, go for it!|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Buy a ticket to the game, and just before game time, sing along with the anthem singer.  Works for me.

Part of the sonar equipment is called a transducer. The transducer produces a sound wave, and then listens for the echo of the sound wave retuning to the transducer. Sound travels at a known speed through water, so the time that it takes for a sound wave to travel from the transducer, to the bottom of the lake, and back to the transducer, can be used to determine distance. When a fish passes between the bottom of the lake and the transducer, the sound wave made by the transducer bounces off the fish before it even gets to the bottom of the lake, and the sonar can "see" the difference in the time it takes.|`|amlmhoUuaa	It is sound waves that are sent under the water to detect any movement and it sens it back to the transducer  that sends it to your fish finder|`|RxTIzsyhaa	All good responses ~ just addin' a' link that'll confirm their comments;)... < ' ( (( > <<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lei-extras.com/tips/sonartut/howitworks.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.lei-extras.com/tips/sonartut/...</a>|`|n8qg1nq3aa	The air in a fishes swim bladder causes the sonar to detect a different medium through which the waves travel.|`|993fcb93deece49f6332462fbe7604c8aa	If the sonar waves are reflected back to the dolphin, then there is something (a fish) there.

yikZNA7aaa	most DT's are taller, but in high school it doesn't particularly matter unless you play in an absolutely powerhouse league. I played 4 years in high school and during that time we had 2 different nose tackles and 6 different dt's (we ran a 5-2). The NT's were 5'7" and 5"9" respectively and only one of the defensive tackles was taller than 5'11". It really doesn't matter about height that much plus being shorter might help because you can fire out lower and get under bigger o-linemans' pads and stuff the middle if you sacrifice your body.|`|be41d7db52515f484bafe88d6e575aadaa	You are a couple of inches shorter than an average Highschool D.T. (at least here in Southern Califoria) It's hard to tell based only on your size, without knowing your specific skill set.<br>  <br>  Judging by size alone, sounds like you would have a better shot playing offensive line.  Hit those tall boys low, engage, push up and dig.|`|a7bfee8f94afdfd3ac16e448849ea19faa	7'-7" give or take
Nuj1eScCaa	No, I love the Pistons and I wish the best for them but they aren't a championship caliber team right now. However, I think that if they were to not play Iverson the rest of the season they could squeak into the 5th seed maybe even 4th if things go right.<br>  <br>  Personally I think they should have stopped playing him long ago.<br>  <br>  The Pistons are getting better now each game, but their defense is not as intense as it once was on a nightly basis. Antonio McDyess and Rasheed Wallace and Tayshaun Prince have been the best defenders on the team this year. But as a team they've had lapses. They can still make a really good playoff push though, and that's more than I think most people expected.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	yes, iverson is giving the 13 points, trade him for durant, (which i think oklahoma are stupid enought to accept) and the would win.<br>  <br>  iverson is a joke, he was the best at his time, but his time has passed.|`|6SsSjqFTaa	No.<br>  They're just not good enough, with or without Iverson. They're worse than they were last year and the Cavs, Celtics and Magic all got better. Plus they would have to beat the Lakers. It's just not gonna happen. They're too old. Joe Dumars traded for Iverson for cap space and made it look like he was trying to compete. haha. They will have trouble even making it to the Conference Finals, let alone win it.|`|fJhVPz3Haa	yes they have hamilton
TH1fT6rdaa	I am not sure, and Griffin is smart to not disclose his religious beliefs.  Religion is about as personal of a subject as you can get, and exposing your religion to the public is usually not a wise decision.<br>  <br>  If he did grow up on the Bible Belt, evidence would show that he is likely some kind of orthodox Christian (but probably not hardcore fundamentalist, as they would likely view MMA as immoral).  If he is, however, a somewhat practicing Christian, Christians around the world could possibly get angry at Forrest for being an immoral Christian.<br>  <br>  The Scientologist comment is almost undoubtedly a joke.  Forrest is known for saying things like that, like how he was going to "pick the ugliest guys for his team" on TUF 8.<br>  <br>  So, I would say, if he is practicing, he is a nondenominational Christian, but is wise (or just not stupid) to not publicize it.  This is only based on intuition and logic, however.|`|0YkLvjgcaa	Griffin has never discussed his religious beliefs in public, to my knowledge.<br>  <br>  As for religious beliefs being someone's "own business" - it isn't as though we're going through the man's garbage. The OP is curious, simple as that.<br>  <br>  To top it off -someone's religious beliefs are not at all their "own business". Our behavior is inextricably linked to our beliefs - they shape the way we act.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Have you ever heard that a person's religion is thier own business?|`|PuxP6UzVaa	Maybe Forrest Griffin doesn't want to talk about it.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Ask him <a href="http://www.forrestgriffin.net/message_center.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.forrestgriffin.net/message_ce...</a> ? <br>  <br>  I'd kind of doubt he is Baptist or Church of Christ like most folks in Georgia, because he grew up in Ohio.

jXCHQOU3aa	there isn't that much you can do, just make sure that when you go to track practice you give up your best effort. also, its just the beginning of the track season somewhere midway into the season your times will get lower. if you get some shoes with spikes to use during the meets you'll get a better time, just try not to use them in practice or too much because they are bad for your feet|`|04F4149yaa	omg...I get 16 and I'm only a year younger than you.

NR5LhOpPaa	Okay. This is quite an undertaking, but not impossible, at all.  I've been assisting in a tennis clinic the past few summers, and we teach that age group.  It's not always easy, but it is fun.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing: You have to be patient.  It's not all going to work out right away.  We're lucky if there's one kid in our 5-7 y/o class who is capable of holding any sort of rally by the end of the summer.  And that's out of 30 kids.  <br>  <br>  You'll want to limit participation to just 5 or 6 kids, if it's only you doing the instruction.  And six becomes a handful very quickly if you don't have them constantly entertained.<br>  <br>  To start with, you might want to do some very basic stuff.  Like, not even with the tennis racquet.  Line them up on the baseline, and teach them what lines are what with a little Simon-Says.  Just say "simon says... go to the service line!", and have them run to the service line, and so on.<br>  <br>  For actual hitting, you're going to be tossing the balls to them.  Show them all the proper form (basic stance, continental grip, etc).  You'll have to toss the ball so it goes right to their strike zone at first.  The first few lessons will be mostly for them getting their coordination down.  You'll probably have to tell them all when to swing and everything.  You do have to emphasize them getting the right form, but you don't want to be overly insistent with it.  Don't be on their case constantly, or they aren't going to have fun.<br>  <br>  Vary the activities, too.  Don't spend a whole day on forehands.  You should do some forehands, backhands, and volleys every day, so they aren't doing any single thing for too long.  <br>  <br>  For the volleys, have them stand so they can just reach the net with their racquet.  Have them take a step back, and stop.  Get them all into proper volley form (no ready position yet).  Then, you'll basically just be tossing the ball directly into their racquets, while they (hopefully) step forward with the correct foot.<br>  <br>  At the end of each lesson, you'll want to throw in a game or two. Do races where they have to keep the ball balanced on their strings and run from one court to the next.  We also play chicken.  Again, have them balance the ball on their strings.  Start with everybody on one side of a court.  When you say go, everybody walks around (staying within the bounds of the court) and tries to use their free hand to knock other kids' balls off their racquets.  Last one standing wins.<br>  <br>  Like I said, it's important to keep it fun.  If they aren't having fun, they won't want to learn.|`|gPqBBfsgaa	Around here it's always "King of The Court", more fun if you have more people around to play.|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Keep in mind that coaching isn't the easiest thing to do. But if there really isn't any other option to choose, then okay. I must say that it'll most likely be troublesome for you since kids from 5-10 years old aren't always well-mannered and punctual. It is much harder than you think it is. I'm really out of tips here, but this is all i got. Start them off by doing some stretching exercises, teach them as you go. I'm sure they will listen. Then start having a hit with each other. Etc. and you should conclude by playing a few games. <br>  <br>  Make sure you do your best. If you make one mistake, then they will lose interest. So try your hardest and don't give up easily.
hABeSlLHaa	From the looks of who you got, you probably reached a bit early for pitchers.  I personally wouldn't trust V-Mart/Guzman.  I'd get rid of Chris Davis and try to get a better SS, since Davis could easily be a flop.  Pitching is PHENOMENAL.<br>  <br>  7/10|`|OXHLqBuwaa	Pitching is awsome you could trade Dan Uggla and Randy Winn for like Dustin Pedroia, or Chase Utley, maybe Brandon Phillips, or Robinson Cano
jXCHQOU3aa	if you got the best score compared to the other students BEFORE you started running 2-3 miles a day for the past few months, then you have nothing to worry about. as long as you don't pace yourself in a dumb way thats illogical you'll be fine. your going to win anyways why does it matter. the best tip for the pacer is to not give up. most people give up when they're tiered and don't feel like running, but you have to push through that and keep going until there is no possible way you can keep going, its all about mindset|`|LpsnLhVSaa	OK first off, your young and full of energy, congrats on your 80 haha well my advice to you is to control your breathing(in through your nose, out through mouth) and don't speed so fast at the start of the pacer because...it doesn't go that fast! I would say pick up speed from about 40 and just go faster by a little, not a sprint and i think around 60, you should start going fast. I made it to 84 for the high school pacer, dang it was hard, but yeah definately pick up pace gradually from 40+.

tvuhGTD9aa	If he hit it on 23-May, it could be worth up to low three figures, but you'd have to have some extremely convincing provenance for it.<br>  <br>  Any other date, eh. Even with provenance, not so much.<br>  <br>  Without provenance, it's just a used baseball with Seligula's signature scrawled upon it.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not even the price of a baseball, since its technically a used baseball.<br>  <br>  I mean, I know you're hoping its worth a lot, but even if there was value in a Shawn Green HR ball, how can you prove it was a HR ball hit by him?  I mean, in all honesty, I can go to the store, buy an NL ball, go to the park and hit it a few times and you'd never know the difference.  The actual value it would have would be to you, knowing you caught a HR ball.  I mean, like I have hockey pucks I've caught at games, they'll never be worth anything, but its something to keep as a memory of the game, and the fight I almost got in for that puck, lol.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Game tickets = $80<br>  Drinks, hot dogs and nachos = $35<br>  Catching a homerun ball from a short time player that no one will ever remember = Worthless<br>  <br>  Go ahead and the let the neighborhood kids play a few games with it.|`|SaCMyfHPaa	Not a whole lot, if it was one of the 4 that he hit in one game it might be worth somthing.  Hell, I will give you 5 bucks for it!!|`|Cb6BheBgaa	About $4.95. The price of a baseball.
CttL3LmBaa	Short cage - no.<br>  Long cage - yes.<br>  Some road stuff is tougher than mtb.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	I use a Shimano 105 on my mountain bike, but it is modified with a mid size XT roller cage. I have been using it for a few years, no problem.|`|o65mz3jnaa	A road mech will handle off-road just fine. Most downhillers run road mechs as they run road cassettes and the shorter cage flaps around less. You WILL get problems if you try to run a triple chainset and/or a cassette with a low sprocket of any bigger than 28 teeth as the mech isn't designed for large sprockets and the short cage will not take up enough chain for a triple chainset. That said if you are very good with your gear selection it works lovely. I ran a Shimano 105 rear mech on an 11-28 cassette with a 42-32-24 chainset for years with no problems.|`|QHgVrXUoaa	road bike components aren't made to handle the stress of off roading since the environmental conditions are much different ( i.e. mud, rocks, deep water, sand) versus the hard pack pavement the road bike will see.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	McG has it, if the cage is not long enough the chain can get all bound up due to chain tension problems.

That said, they're not especially loud.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	the M203 has a real kick to it. during training most people shoot off the training paint rounds. but a real round is loud and strong. not really sure what you mean in comparison to a firework shell when it burst? all i know when i went to shoot off the real thing i was expecting the same kick as the training rounds. it almost knocked me down.|`|rM18eYnaaa	its probly a little softer then a firework
3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Of course! That's why 2/3rds of the Hunting section questions are about airsoft.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I don't think they allow elephant hunting in Kenya any more.  You should have discussed this with your safari guide before committing to the trip.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Defiantly take the airsoft!!! No questions asked. Just tell the locals it is a plutonium bb.|`|AA11694178	It's up to you, you are paying for the trip.  You can hunt elephants successfully with either gun.  The problem occurs if you decide to use one of the guns to shoot the elephant when you find it.  Both guns are inadequate but the airsoft is less likely to piss the elephant off and make him kill you.  I think if I were you and I wanted to shoot an elephant once I had hunted him down, I'd select the airsoft gun.  As long as you stay quiet,and the elephant didn't see you, you could get off quite a few airsoft shots before he wondered off.  If he does see you, though, he will kill you.  That's okay because if you are dumb enough to take an airsoft gun elephant hunting, we really need your end of the gene pool cleaned out anyway.|`|RRFbDou9aa	No.<br>  <br>  Yay!  2 points!|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Your call|`|517722e044003718f8f92512815e4c2eaa	i wont tell anyone|`|PnS3wHQiaa	The airsoft gun will work fine as long as you can get the elephant to stand still so you can shoot it in the head 700 times. It should pass out from hemorrhaging a few days later.|`|JfyFB3Q8aa	Umm, I say you should take a high power assault rifle?

Nuj1eScCaa	I'm being as unbiased as I can and I watched the game and many replays, but I think that was foul partly intentional. Ariza was frustrated because they're losing badly and just took a swipe at Rudy, not really aiming for just the ball, but aiming to stop him entirely.<br>  <br>  I mean really Ariza fans, if that same thing happened to an important role player on your team you wouldn't be defending Trevor Ariza. Then, after the fact Ariza had the nerve to start picking fights with other players.<br>  <br>  With 3 seconds to go in the quarter, no need to take somebody out like that. The ejection and maybe even a 1 game suspension would be justified.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	i didn't see it, probably will tomorrow or tonight, but all the Laker fans say it wasn't cheap but everyone else says it was a cheap shot.|`|IUxM3brbaa	Well you shouldn't assume anything unless you are Rudy or you talked to him and know how he felt.<br>  <br>  He could have really been hurt sure, but don't make any claims about someone being hurt or not and not being able to do anything.<br>  <br>  AND it was a clean foul, please go buy a high-def tv.

If it is a 10 team league then I would say an 7 out of 10.

jXCHQOU3aa	all of these problems could be because of low arches that collapse on your feet. you should go to a doctor and ask them to check weather your arches collapse or not, if they do you just need to buy some insoles for your shoes and you'll be fine, also it could be your shoes if your don't have proper running shoes, or if you have very old shoes there is going to be lots of stress on your body. try not running on asphalt or pavement because that could also increase your chances of getting these things. it could also be because either your knees or hips are weak so your back arches and other muscles are trying to make up for it by takeing some of the stress off and putting more stress on themselves. you should probably go to a physical therapist|`|fzlHDkXbaa	It could well be your hips, but I'm not a GP or doctor, so I really am not too sure.

Stop reaching for the ball (yes you are...). The term "backstop" is accurate for a catcher you are there to catch the ball so focus on that and only that just turn off the hitter; they have their own issues. You will not be hurt if you know how to use your armor - I used to train catchers by making them block pitches in the dirt without a glove and you get used to the fact that you are protected and have more than just glove to stop the ball. Always assume that the batter will miss the ball. Most of the time they will. It's also an attitude that you are invincible with all that gear and if attack a few balls and throw your body in the way and take an aggressive fearless attitude (with the knowledge that you have all that gear to protect you) you can inspire other people to play better.<br>  <br>  I have been pounded - It doesnt hurt.|`|qAVADb9vaa	just keep practicing. get in position and have a batter swing as if you were in a game. you have to get used to the fact that the bat is going to be swung at lot during the course of a game. you might even get hit by a bat, but thats rare. good luck =)|`|B46t8gkLaa	you just have to practice enough. eventually the fear will fade away.|`|37964990822e94f29802880a94facc8daa	just practice. keep doing it and focus on not doing that. it take time and work.|`|DgaFTvKMaa	Practice with someone pretending to bat (actually swinging but MISSING the ball) while your pitcher is pitching to you. Don't reach for the ball- if their bat hits your glove, they automatically get first base. Let the ball come to you, but ALWAYS assume that the batter is going to miss it, therefore you will always be ready to catch it. Also have the batter bat left handed--- it will help when you have to catch for a left-handed batter.  And never squat down until the batter is in position- it will help you to know where you need to be- not too close, but not too deep. Flinching is normal at the beginning- once you have confidence in youself things will fall into place.|`|1hKRx8LKaa	The best thing for it is repetition.

The amount of "fish attracting" properties in any attractant is minimal to none.  <br>  <br>  (The reason I state the above is in response to the reviews for the Berkley attractant.)|`|amlmhoUuaa	Garlic and salt impregnated baits work well the have also come out with coffee scented lures now too. The other option is to go buy a bottle of fish attractant its not that much.|`|tZPOSvHQaa	Fish love live food.<br>  the smell of fresh (remember that word)<br>  FRESH<br>  live foods so smash up some worms <br>  use it to coat a grasshopper <br>  a grasshopper kicks violently under water the smell and movement<br>  will nab them every time. <br>  <br>  The opposite has worked well to. smashed grasshopper on fresh worm<br>  <br>  try your mix but you will agree fresh is best if its alive you will catch<br>  <br>  fish follow movements think of a shark they smell blood (an injured fish)<br>  they come fast .|`|SEpHGcnKaa	I have no idea.

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Learning throttle control when jumping is just a case of tons of seat time and making sure if you don't give it enough the first time you adjust your control for the next time and eventually you will get better at judging just how much power you need for a jump.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Practice your throttle control on smaller jumps and slowly work up to the bigger ones and if you can train with someone else who knows what they are doing you can follow them into a jump and gage your speed by theirs.   That is the safest way to attempt a new jump.<br>    <br>  You just have to hope that if you case a jump you don't end up with broken arms or legs.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Just takes practice. Every jump will be different so there is no one answer to your question. That is the cool thing about table tops though, you can't under-jump them like a double or triple. Just keep hitting it a little harder each pass until you clear it.|`|b092ab65e040c56e24799928ab0c36f1aa	i agree with auburn, but one thing. i live in dallas texas and have been all over texas racing and for every jump that ive had to jump either you will know the speed or you can just go as fast as you want out of the corner before and you will make it. tracks are built where you can go as fast as you want and you will be fine. (most of the time). and even a quarter bit more throttle off the face will take you sooooo much farther
tfOkM8Wraa	No really, because they were cross-branding before draft was announced and they always overload cb matches before big ppv's like RR,WM,Sum-SLam and S.Series...<br>  <br>  But my thought are they want to keep 3 different brand to push rating, by having a big star cross, and keep a main star. but people still don't watch ECW so talents like Christian, Miz, Morrison need air time that people watch too... <br>  <br>  But Christian to Win Tonight and Win Money in the Bank and Edge to Retain(Cheating) bout CC cashing in on his Bro! building the Hardy vs Hardy and E vs C storyline soon to come(i am hoping)  Matt and Edge vs Christian and Jeff at BACKLASH all on Smackdown or 4 way for World Title TLC!!!

Seeing Christian on Raw was pretty cool, and hopefully he gets drafted either to there or Smackdown during the draft. The only thing is I wish guys would stay on their own brands and not have cross over matches all the time.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	yeah, it allows the guys to get a feel for if they want to switch shows or not. i guarantee u Cena or Orton gets drafted to Smackdown. and Undertaker or Edge comes to Raw.|`|RUMzIzzdaa	John Cena 2 Smackdown? - Because of Edge<br>  Triple H to Raw?

Y3KMLdjWaa	Shipping weight and bike weight are not the same. What DHL will list is the shipping weight, that is bike, box and any other items such as padding.|`|CttL3LmBaa	A bicycle box weighs 10 to 12 lbs.<br>  <br>  If you have the bike already step on the scale note your weight.  Pick up the bike and hold it on the scale and do the math and see how much the bike weighs.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It should weigh around 27 lbs like you said.  If someone packaged this bike it's going to weigh more then the original packaging especially if it was double boxed.  People tend to error on the safe side with extra padding in the box.

He will be damaged and the Steroids will win.  No one has come back from his operation and been the same.  The Yankees will not be there again in October.  The Red Sox will win the AL East and will make it to the World Series and win.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I say that when A Rod does come back & in the Yankee line-up he will still put up some decent numbers & still be helpful to the rest of the team & help the Yankees compete for division & don't ever count the Yankees out of winning AL East|`|e9dHHGCSaa	I say the Rays, unless the Red Sox pitching stays healthy. I don't give the Yankees much of a shot, but you never know.|`|1a4f8OD1aa	he will come back and have a good season. but  they wont win the division.
hGL1Ibkuaa	It depends on the keeper. I watch him for a little while before I take the kick and if he seems keen to dive I'll chip it gently right down the middle.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I'll try and place it just to the right of his head when he stands...almost impossible for him to save there...but also very difficult to be that accurate.|`|4Td7hgqBaa	Placement over power, the spot i normally go for is wide and low. Sometimes if the keeper likes to dive all over the place I will sometimes go head high where he was standing.|`|xpBrDAWUaa	same spot i usually liek to take put mine higher rather than lower and for what side thats pretty much just what im feelin at the time sometimes even a nice outside of the foot to really stun em|`|5XltfLhTaa	Well I am similar to you that I face the right post and stand around 2 to 3 yards back. I prefer a short and quck run up as I have a strong shot and it gives the keeper less time to prepare and predict.<br>  <br>  Overall, it depends on the keeper. If the keeper is tall, I go for placement with a low angle shot. If the keeper is short, I usually go for more power and hit it towards the corners.<br>  <br>  Haha right or left actually depends on my own insticts. But most of the time I follow one rule. Most keepers do not stand exactly in the middle. One area os left larger than the other. I aim for the smaller area, as most of the times the keeper will jump expecting the ball to go to the larger area. <br>  <br>  But if the keeper isin the middle, then I use my own instinct. <br>  <br>  Hehe want to have a penalty shootout?

I think they're doing it to save money also. I have never even heard of Kizarny (not too keen with the new wrestlers :P) so I'm not too disappointed with their choice of wrestlers to release. I didn't know Boogeyman was released though.<br>  <br>  LMAO! What packofcrisps said was hilarious! I was utterly disgusted and disturbed by that. It's like 'Yeah, Eddie Guererro died so let's write a storyline where his widow has to make out with every wrestler on the roster!' ahahah.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	They do this every 6 months or so. They released a bunch of guys around the time they released 'Domino'.|`|RUMzIzzdaa	Kizarny is not released yet... he just wrestles dark matches...<br>  <br>  But i guess they released Boogeyman and Scotty Goodman because of the recession...lol<br>  <br>  BQ.

2s244jGgaa	You have a good 22 PLAYERS, the reserves are a bit shaky but thats fine provided no one on your team gets hurt. I think your forward line is excellent and along with your strong midfield you will be a force to be reckoned with, good luck in supercaoch this year. Your team is worthy of gathering many points.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	looks pretty good to me.|`|QGY8BYS7aa	supercoach is gay. Join the Dreamteam. More people and the scoring system is simpler! not like supercoach where you get deducted points sometimes!<br>  Anyway belive it or not I did play supercoach last year and this is not a good team.<br>  1. Supercoach is a game where you get points on how many effective possiesions you get.<br>  2. Picking someone like Harvey won't help because he is high possiesion player but can lose you heaps of points if he's not playing well!|`|AUmdOhBbaa	Very Good Nice To See Sam Fisher In The Team<br>  Good Choice on Harvey Should Score <br>  Well <br>  With The Rucks Take Out Tippet And Or Petrie And Have Someone Like Dean Cox With Jack Watts Being The Other One <br>  Otherwise You Have A Good Team <br>  <br>  Almost Identical To Mine|`|kIEUTLIdaa	Dale Thomas???

Volleyball/Track - Sports, Dance/Skating - Arts.  Maybe looking at it like that will help you decide.<br>  <br>  DON'T quit Irish Dance just because some people don't know what it is!

2s244jGgaa	He became a regular in the squad last year in 2008 and he even won a rising star nomination in round 19. I think that will help him earn his spot in the team this year, being a medium sized midfielder I think it may be hard for him to find a spot on the team (with judd, gibbs, stevens, kreuzer, warnock etc) being in the squad already, but if he does play well I think a player of his sort can make the team to play on the weekends.|`|rIIJuVkmaa	defintley a gun|`|V5rirlgOaa	Hi there, yeah he'll definately be in the side and after a solid 2008 he's really worked hard on his fitness and wants to push for a changing role in the midfield,and going by his 27 touches on the weekend id say he'll be right in the mix............GO BLUES!

It was a hard foul but Trevor played the ball- and the refs gave the flagrant more on how Rudy Fernandez landed.  <br>  <br>  We've all seen the same video and Trevor played the ball.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|b2qdwABVaa	From the replay, it looks like Ariza made a play on the ball.  Since the ball was on Rudy's left hand, he had to swing across as he was coming from the right side to block it.  It's unfortunate that he caught a piece of Rudy's head, but I think he'll be alright.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that that play warrants a flagrant 2.  If you want to see examples of dirty plays: look at Big Baby's throwing down Verajao by the neck in the last Celtics-Cavs game.  Look at Kendrick Perkins throwing Jason Maxiell down by his neck when the Celtics played the Pistons.  Or when David West karate chopped Mike Miller.  Those are intentional dirty plays, not on the ball.|`|PA0gmwd5aa	I'm not a Lakers fan,but it really looked like T.Ariza went for the ball.He took a bad angle and that's why it looked so bad.Make no mistake though that there is real bad blood now considering what Odom did last year to Roy.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Ariza did try to block the ball.

S0u3HKzhaa	Cause the wwe drooped the storyline.I think it was to inappropriate to the wwe's standards for their PG rating.My guess is because Orton made a reference to a One Night Stand to Kelly Kelly.Which was kind of dumb because most of these kids had no clue what Orton was talking about.But the storyline was dropped.<br>  <br>  I think the storyline had potential until they put Orton in it.At that time they really had Randy Orton in just about every storyline.And Orton wears his wedding ring to the ring every week too.If the storyline was going to work they should have used a different mid card wrestler not Randy Orton.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	The storyline wasn't going anywhere, it was boring as heck.<br>  Kane was going to end up doing a Kahli like thing (stud monster)<br>  That would have meant that he would become another big talent lost in the WWE clown world|`|k8fMMxKdaa	they messed that storyline up when they made orton the guy she was hiding from kane|`|8pS0oT4faa	guess they abandoned that storyline|`|4tvI9WYjaa	cause kane found out kelly kelly was fake|`|ULSUqmeZaa	what are you talking about? kane, kelly kelly and legacy have nothing to do with eachother.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	That was lame wasn't it?Prbably best they did just drop it.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	Have you been in a coma for 1/2 months?|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	What the?!?! that makes no sense... They have nothing to do with each other...|`|khU8m4gxaa	It's safe to assume that the creative team had something planned out, but had to change things. I think maybe they originally may have intended for Batista to be the BF, but then he got hurt, so they scrapped it, but made Orton the guy just to explain it, then end it. I don't know for certain, but Batista did date Kelly in real life briefly and they like to bring real life stories into the show frequently, so I think it's a decent assumption.
4I3kRqPjaa	I agree with everyone that this is a good price. If you want to see for youeself go to gunbroker.com and check it out (kind of like ebay but for guns). Anyway the ammo is pretty cheap and plentiful, look into surplus ammo, just make sure to clean carefully for corrosive ammo. A few other military arms that you can check out on gunbroker, that would fit your budget and are great shooters:<br>  <br>  1) Enfield .303<br>  2) Swedish Mauser 6.5 x 55<br>  <br>  Both of these are great rifles and perfect for target or hunting. But do not get discouraged the Nagant is a great 1st rifle. You can find some great assessories at centerfiresystems.com as well.  Good luck!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes *   You can buy 300 rounds for $85.00 at Texas Gun Trader.com*.. Take it to a Gunsmith for an evaluation as to whether its a good rifle and worth the $$$ their asking for it.* Its better to be safe than sorry.*|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Yes. You can strip and clean the wood and refinish the stock anyway you like. If it isn't broke, don't replace.  Don't mess with bi-pods. A scope might be fun. Find a proper mount for it.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	$100 for a Nagant is standard. <br>  <br>  Try taking out the bolt, pointing the rifle up at a light and looking down the barrel. <br>  <br>  Oh, and if you want to ID it....<br>  <a href="http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinID.htm" rel="nofollow">http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinID.htm</a><br>  <br>  Final note: If you put a polymer stock on that thing, people will mock you endlessly. <br>  <br>  Scopes can be a pain to mount because of the bolt, but the iron sights on mine, as well as a friend's are wonderful, and have held their zero for over 70 (yes, SEVENTY) years. Don't worry about optics.|`|XpnnNLkOaa	Mosins are just plain awesome.  Ammo is plentiful.  Kick isn't horrible, either.  Definitely buy it, but look into a cleaner kit right away.  It sounds horribly dirty and ill-kept.  Clean it SUPER well before you even think of using it.  You'll want 7.62x54 ammo.  Shop around a bit; bad ammo is not fun.<br>  <br>  Oh, one more thing:  these were used by snipers in WWII for a reason.  They're rather accurate, and not much stops these bullets.|`|1a4f8OD1aa	yeah|`|fAu1f0r3aa	yeah|`|WT8g2jJoaa	If it has the bayonet along with all of that, and the numbers are matching, then yes it is a good deal. you can find surplus ammo for around $90 for 440 rounds. Just make sure you clean it right after, most surplus ammo is corrosive and will cause rusting in the barrel.<br>  <br>  My advice, do not get a bipod, do not add a different stock, or a scope. It is a historical piece. People back in the 50's and 60's are now regretting "sporterizing" the mausers that they brought back, and the same will happen for these.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	It isn't a great price, but it is not bad.<br>  <br>  Just be sure the bore is good before you hand over the cash.  If need be, run a couple of patches wet with solvent down the barrel and give it a good look.<br>  <br>  For a hundred bucks, you are not going to get a NIB Safari Grade Model 70 Winchester.  The gun is probably older than you father so don't sweat the stock finish.  If you don't like it, it is easy to remove the barreled action and refinish the stock.  But even with a refinish, don't expect much.  Most of those rifles were stocked in pallet wood rejects to start.<br>  <br>  If you have your doubts, save your money a couple more months and buy yourself a brand new Savage in .308 or .30-'06, or you can get a new .30-30 WCF Marlin Model 336 for a modest price.<br>  <br>  Good Shooting,<br>  Doc|`|QrjuueMCaa	MoNags are usually sub-par rifles, but for what you get for the price, they are usually fairly decent. Look at the barrel first-(remove the bolt) and look for pitting or heavy wear. <br>  <br>  Addressing the accessories...You can polish a turd, but it is still a turd. If I had to decide between getting 100$ worth of "polish" or get some surplus ammo, I would take the ammo. Whatever you do, don't waste too much cash on the 'polish'. It is just a MoNag.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, it is a good gun (usually). Hope it works well for you if you decide to purchase it.<br>  <br>  Lock and load. Keep your powder dry!!
Tu9S1WaNaa	Be sure to have your ID with you and maybe your receipt.  My brother thought he misplaced some concert tickets he had printed.  He re-printed them and went to the concert.  When he got there, his tickets had already been scanned.  He had to show his ID and they let him in because my Dad's name was on the invoice.  <br>  <br>  He later found out that somebody stole the ticks he printed and sold them to somebody else.  He was only allowed to get in because he proved he bought them from ticketmaster.|`|pX7SwZh7aa	I always print my tickets for concerts and I have never had a problem with mine before.|`|UFanxPOgaa	nope never printed my own tickets for a nascar race.. but i have for concerts.. and have never had a problem with that.. soo i doubt u will for the race.. it wouldn't be an option if it was something they didn't expect ppl to do.. soo i wouldn't worry about it.. i'm excited about bristol tho! i just bought tix today! woohoo!! maybe i'll cya there!! lol
