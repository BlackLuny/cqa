I have a list of homework that never gets done. As I struggle to get it finished, it gets bigger daily. It is like a horror that never leaves me. I need it to jot down my homework but as I see it, it is terrifying.       I feel so anxious for an answer. I need help. I have no life because of this problem ( I stay at home all day, every day). I feel like I have no solution anymore. for example I have a literary notebook and essay due today but they're too difficult for me. I need some help and I can't find it anywhere (not even the internet is helping). That's just adding on to my stress because now my teacher is going to tell me something bad and I'm going to feel the shower of disappointment from him and from myself for being incompetent.       I am capable of doing the work given, but there is never enough time for me to relax. My friends don't even get to see me during breaks or lunch because I'm always inside the classroom doing homework or studying. Please help. I feel so desperate for a solution.      I just came back recently to school after a week long absence due to this problem. It is affecting me in everyway possible. My health is suffering (lack of sleep, increased heartrate due to stress, nerve twitching), my life is suffering (no time for myself, not even an hour), my grades are suffering. I'm losing faith in myself. I feel like I have no hope left in the form of an answer. Please don't disappoint me Yahoo Answers. I need only helpful and necessary answers. I can't handle this anymore.

I am trying to plan before, during, and after activities and for the "before" I wanted to build on their prior knowledge by asking them questions about what happened in The Three Little Pigs, the characters, events, etc. After reading The Three Little Javelinas, I wanted to ask the students to name some similiarities and differences in the two stories and I would write them in a Venn Diagram. Is this too much above the kindergarten capacity? Or will they be just fine as long as the teacher is writing and helping facilitate the discussion?

I know you "accuse" a person in the chant, and they claim they didn't, then they "accuse" someone else, etc. But is there any action in the game? Is the cookie passed around, or does the person in charge secretly choose someone to hold onto the cookie until everyone else guesses the right person? I want to try this with my class this year, to tie in with a book we'll read.

Okay, I got a letter from Washington University in St. Louis talking about how they would like me to attend their school and such. Normally, I wouldn't think that much of it, but this is different. I looked up the school and found out that they were ranked as the 8th toughest school to get into by U.S News Reports and the Princeton Review (2 very very reliable sources). I don't understand why this school is ranked so high if most of my friends and I got letters from them. Are they just trying to recruit? Does this mean that I have a good shot at Columbia (one of my dream schools that is ranked lower than this school)?       Thanks so much for trying to help!

By junior year, I'll probably be looking at something easier, but a doctor is the only thing I could imagine being the rest of my life (until I retired, of course), so far.       How many people actually stick with it all throughout their college career? And how many people coming from a not-so-wealthy family have made it through years of training without quitting because of money issues, and then gone on to be successful doctors?

Used online accredited degree program that would be accepted by my state's DPI to upgrade my educational experience.  Completed the program (GPA=4.0) & 4 hr. written comps and was notified but now...they are dragging their feet - no diploma  mailed, have made dozens of calls, e-mails, & written requests.  Now they REFUSE to fill out a verification form to document my degree completion.  What can I do?  This means everything looked reputable about university and degree program but is it? I have just completed a 2 yr. master's degree and spent 10K and have nothing to prove it. What can I do if my employer refuses to upgrade my educational experience without form?

Also, would it be possible to make the same amount of money as a Plastic surgeon, or is being a doctor just playing it safe? Thanks!

I'm turning 30 soon and starting to wonder if I might be better suited to an academic career. I have an undergraduate business degree and a master's in journalism. I've been in Asia for several years and would like to continue living and making my career here. Unfortunately, I'm not very impressed by universities in the region. I've heard that some institutions tend to avoid hiring their own graduates in favor of foreign-educated academics.       I've met people who are pursuing PhDs at US/UK/Canadian universities but somehow manage to live here most of the time and even work full time. This is very appealing to me as I now have a lot of business contacts and personal connections here. Does anyone know which reputable universities allow PhD candidates the most freedom to pursue their research/studies while overseas?      I'm interested in Asia-focused economics/political economy and am open to considering reputable universities located anywhere in the world!

I'm looking to transfer to a Christian college in New York. I am currently majoring in Biblical Studies and would like to double major in Music. My current school has a horrible music department. I'm looking for a school that provides a music major, preferably with the ability to focus in performance, along with a good Theology department.      Most schools I've been able to find seem ultra-conservative, which surprises me for New York. I was looking at Nyack and part of their "moral code" is that you won't engage in "Social Dancing". Now, to be honest I don't dance that much but that has to be a reflection on the way they approach theology and if it is then I'm not impressed.      I hope someone can give me a bit of direction.

I am planning to take pre-medicine in my college years, but the university I am going to attend does have courses to prepare students who want to persue pre-medicine studies. The problem is; it says it does not have particular "pre-medicine" course, but a student must first declare his/er major. So I was thinking of either a biology maj., or chemistry maj. - which should I take? I do not really know what to do. Please someone out there, help me, it will be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Please e-mail me if necessary. I am now a senior and graduating this June. I have taken Chemistry Honors and nearly failed the class. I am now in the school's nursing assistant program and been exposed to the medical field hoping it will do me well in the future for medical school. I have a G.P.A of 90. I do not know if this is good enough. The math I have taken are Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II, lastly, Geometry. Is being a doctor right for me with these circumstances?

My first choice was to go into civil engineering.  I don't know anything about engineering, but I do know what engineers do.  At least the final product.  But I love music.  I play the trumpet and I love it.  I know that I'd have a hard time making a living unless I was incredible, but it'd still be fun.  I'm almost afraid that I'd start looking at music as a job instead of the beatiful talent that I see it as now.  I don't want to waste anymore time by choosing a major then not sticking with it, so it's either civil engineering or music.  But.. there's nothing to say if I choose engineering that I can't keep playing and loving music...

I also teach my child more advanced stuff for areas that the school isn't bad at. The result is fantastic. My child performs at very high levels across most areas. My child told me that she learns more from me than her teachers. School is still good for English, sport and social development. She is very happy with the combined approach.      When I discuss this on the Internet with others, all teachers seem to be very quick to abuse me.      Do you have same issues like mine in the USA?

I was so stupid that i thought i was never going to get caught. The teacher gave me a 0 for the assigment, but she said its not going to hurt my grade a lot. She also said she is a member of the National honor society which makes it easier for her. This is my first time getting caught plagiarizing but i am scared that my teacher will put this on my high school record(she did not say anything about me having to go to a meeting for this nor putting it on my high school record). my question is do you think she will put it on my high school record? I already applied at one college before this incident and they've also received my high school record along with it. Do you this can ruin my chances going to other universities?. please help

20090223015732AA1tKyv	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What is wrong with this paragraph in terms of grammar and writing style? Too wordy?	The entire world is in an economic recession, and each country has felt its devastating and disheartening effects. Money has become tighter, jobs fewer, and food prices have gone up considerably. The current financial slowdown has probably even prompted many a shopper to think twice about buying a brand new Ipod, and many more to forego a purchase of that nature altogether. However, as citizens of an astoundingly wealthy, industrialized nation, if we believe that our current situation is disappointingly inopportune, then we would be greatly mistaken. Not only would we be mistaken, we would also be extremely foolish and remiss to lament over our petty woes when millions of people in developing countries live--and often die-- in a state of perpetual poverty, under deplorable conditions.

20090223015255AAHCO4k	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I need some Medical School Advice?	I am currently a senior graduating this summer with my Bachelor's in Biology and applying to Medical School for 2010 (and 2011 or however long it takes to get in :)) but I am pretty sure I am going to need some post-bacc work to get in. My GPA is abysmal, lingering around a 3.0 so I am willing to do whatever it takes to change that. I am taking the MCAT's in April and I tend to be a MUCH better test taker ( I have previous experience with the PCAT's and Kaplan run timed practice MCAT's) and I am dedicating time to my MCAT studies daily. I am pretty positive I can do well in the Biology and Verbal sections (provided I do the work) and with the Physical Sciences, just a little more elbow grease hopefully. I spend most of my undergrad as a Pre-Pharmacy student but upon volunteering in the pharmacy as a tech, I decided that it was not meant for me. I worked for an Optometrist for 6 months as well and currently, I am starting to do research for a professor I took a Genetics course with. Sorry for my life story, on with the point. How do I go about getting my Post-Bac done? I've taken MANY biology classes and there really aren't many others I have left to take at my university. My Organic Chemistry base isn't very strong as I took that when I was 18 i think and was so much more interested in extra-curricular activities, per se. What would be my best plan of action from here? And please, don't offer criticism without help. Do you really I would still be awake at 4 AM thinking about this if I hadn't already considered it?

Hi, well I am very torn right now between two local colleges I would like to attend. I am a Junior in high school and I plan on majoring in Biology. I want to go to University of Central Florida or Valencia Community College. Both are great schools, but I'm not sure which one to go to first. My family advises me to go to VCC first and then UCF for Bachelors and Masters. But my guidance counselor told me it would be best for me to attend UCF when I get out of high school. She was VERY bias in her opinion, basically telling me I would be surrounded with a bunch of morons at VCC. I know that is not true because many people I know attened VCC and were not dumb in any, way, shape, or form. I qualify for a merit scholarship, which pays 100%. I have a 4.0 and I'm already taking two college classes.       I like VCC for the reason that it's smaller classes and a good transition into a major university, like UCF. But since I am going into the science feild, UCF has a science college that goes through the EXCEL program. The EXCEL program is smaller classes, more emphasis on science, free tutoring, and more in depth than just getting your degree generally. I love the two colleges, I am so conflicted of where to go! Any adivce would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

I kept going (baby and all). 3 years ago, she realized that I had been in my career field for 10 yrs. She assumed I counted the yrs. wrong until a mutual friend brought it to her attention that she had been left behind careerwise. Now, 13 yrs after the fact, she wants the exact same career as me. A grown woman who cannot choose her own career path! Anyway, my degrees (all 5) are traditional-16 week classes. 3 yrs ago she told me “you ain’t the only one who can go to college.” Next thing I know, she was enrolled. That was fine. However, In 2004, she had an Associate’s and in 2006 she had a Master’s? DO THE MATH! 2 YR DEGREE TO 6 YR DEGREE IN THAT SHORT TIME PERIOD.   Her classes were 4 and 5 weeks long. She received A’s in everyclass (almost). Even teenagers are graded for 9 weeks. She used the adult learner excuse. Isn't every1 on campus?

Hi guys hopefully someone would be able to answer this for me.  I went to a community college for 3 semesters and my 1st semester was fine and my GPA was high.  But with the second two semesters I had a lot of things going on and I was just not able to do well.  For the 2nd semester my gpa was way below a 2.0 and for the second semester I ended up quitting without dropping my classes and it really hurt my GPA.  This is my question, I am trying to go to a 4 year college and I would have been able to go to this college had it went to it straight from high school but now I am being asked to send my transcripts from my community college before I am admitted.  I really want to go back to school but the thing is I just can't go back to the community college b/c gas prices are too high and it is far away.  Is there a chance that I could be admitted to this school with a very low GPA?  I really want to attend this school and I know I will do good I just had a lot of things going on before.

This caption was just on the news and had a basic story of middle aged folk worried about how they were going to pay for their childrens secondary education. The mindset in my life as well as most others I know is that you immerse yourself as a student in a part time/full time job and college loans and scholarships while attending school. When did it become commonplace for the parents to pay for their childrens college education? Their adults entering college and should begin to learn how the "real world" works. IMO one works harder for something they are paying for themselves (ideally the same for a car, if one pays for a car themself, they tend to take better care of it). Just looking for others opinions out there. I just graduated with a BS in May and made it through working full time and on scholarships (plus about 16k in student loans) and I don't think I'd have the same drive if my parents plunked down the tuition.

20081031104417AAlVObD	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What can I do to better my chances of getting accepted to Medical School, & what study tacticts should I use? ?	I'm presently going to college, and majoring in Biology. My GPA is presently a 3.37. This semester is of the first that I get to take a biology class. Unfortunately I think I will end up with a C in it, but I'm hoping for at least a B in this one. In my other classes I'm getting A's and B's. I want to attend medical school, and I know that a C is definately not going to be good enough when it comes to my chances of getting accepted. This is something I want to do, and I refuse to give up. Should I retake the biology class next semester to get a better grade?  Should I just continue with my other science classes, and if I get A's in them, then don't worry about this class?   My other issue is that I have one of these professors for this class that is basically trying to, as they say, "weed them out". He'll give us a study guide, as well as tell us we should know certain things completely, for example every step of meiosis, mitosis, Cellular respiration, etc (which I know like the back of my hand). Then when he gives us the test, out of 90 questions, there's only like 2 or 3 on what he told us to focus on. For the other questions, some are in the book, but a lot of the others are not, and they've not been covered in class either. I guess my question here is basically, what kind of study tactics should I try out here, because mine our obviously not working? Should I start reading the chapters about 5 times instead of 2 before the test comes? Is there some other angle I should try to approach study wise? I know that everything I read I totally understand it, and I dig it, but it just seems that no matter how hard I study and try with this guy, I just cannot seem to get over a C on our exams. At first I thought it was just me, but on the last exam, the entire class got 50% (literally), except for like 3 or 4 people who got an 83%. I'm frustrated, because this is really messing with my GPA big time.

I am a fresh graduate and this is my first year teaching (practical course of Communication in English - as a foreign language - to computer science students, around 45 in a group). The students are almost my age and there are huge differences between them in terms of language proficiency, attention span and overall interest towards the subject. While things are going fairly well with most groups, I constantly lose control over one group in particular. I use the same types of activities, I don't behave differently towards them and try to adapt by moving more, helping them with the activities and, simply, encouraging them to speak. However, there are several disruptive students who are just inconsiderate and show no respect towards me and their colleagues. They will chat all the time and make irrelevant comments and they just won't stop no matter what I say or do. I am out of ideas and could really use your help.       Thank you,   mia

20081120204604AAhnEB6	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Why do people want to go to prestigious schools?	is it for bragging rights and pride? for more job prospects? to meet better people and learn more? it seems like a big part of prestige is that it makes you better at kissing up to people, like you can impress your friends or the person interviewing you at a job, or you can meet people who may help you get a job later on in life. I personally don't think these are admirable reasons for wanting a prestigious school, just so you can associate yourself with a name and make yourself look better. if you want to go because you think that's where you'll learn the most and develop yourself into a better, hard working person and meet people who share the same ambition as you do, that's one thing, but why does it seem like alot of people want to go just to impress others? also if you go to a good school but major in something that's not very practical, like history, wouldn't you still have trouble finding a job? or is it the "name" that will carry you throughout?

I was wondering what my chances are of getting in, and if I should apply for rolling admission to a state school to be on the safe side. My background:   ACT: 31   SAT: 1460/1600   GPA: 2.7 (fixed...my high school did not use GPAs, and assigned every student who passed the same gpa compiled from an average of neighboring districts. I had straight A's on all work, but yeah, there's no way of verifying that.)   Extracurricular: No sports, ~300 hours of volunteer work.   Honors: My school didn't offer AP/IB etc, I was in the 2 honors courses offered though.

20090223011313AAo0gXI	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How do I approach going back to school (law)?	Ok, here's the deal:   When I was dating my (now) wife in college, I was all set to go to law school after graduation.  She wanted to move with me (about 2000 miles from home) originally.  Then, she got a job offer as a teacher, and she decided she couldn't be that far away from her family.  I decided to stay with her and try to get into a school that was in the area, but I was wait-listed, and was subsequently not admitted.  I decided to go back to school to become a teacher and earn a MA in the process (a joint decision, but she praised my decision due to the fact we'd have similar schedules).  Long story short, I'm teaching as an adjunct at the college I earned my MA from, and am not employed full-time (I have 2 jobs: 1 at a large coffee chain that provides me benefits, and the other teaching).  I'm earning close to 20K/yr.        Here's the problem: I am so so so so bored as a teacher.  I'm not learning anything new, and I will not be able to teach the courses I want without a PhD (5+ more years, and the job market is terrible!!!!). I hate the monotony.       I would really like to pursue law school again, but with a 3-yr old, and 1 on the way, I don't know.  My wife has totally shot down any suggestion of the sort (besides the "rough patch" that has been the last 2 years...), and has semi-threatened to leave if I do.  I'm really unhappy with things, and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels.  The chances of me getting full-time work in the next 5 years are very slim, and in a couple of years, our money problems will be considerably less (due to credit cards being paid off. They eat up $1000/mo right now).      I'm convinced that I need to go to law school, and I know it will improve things for me in the long-run.  Even if I took a 40k/yr job as a public-interest attorney, we'd be making much more than I am now.  Besides, I know I'd be much happier, and I'd be able to move around in the legal field or even get a good job (due to my degree) outside of law if I got bored or whatever. (and, yes, I have AD/HD).      How should I convince my wife that I really, really, really need this?  Last time I brought it up, she suggested that I would be asking her to give up what she loves (her position at her school), and either break up our family or leave her alone to care for the kids while I'm "having fun" in class.      Please help!
