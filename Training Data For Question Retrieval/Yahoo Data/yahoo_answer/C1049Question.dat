Except on Thursdays,: 5:15 AM to 7:15 AM   Saturday- 2 PM to 5 PM      That's 15 hours a week, and it's grueling practice.   This is everyday monday through saturday. We even have practice on Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, and News Years.      This ends February. Then practice from 6:15 AM to 7:15 Monday through friday only.      Its really hard getting up on Thursday at 4:30 AM with so little sleep.The only way to wake up is to drink coffee, otherwise it is just not possible.         I'm on the freshman/sophomore girls basketball team. (I'm a freshman)   Is this too much in your opinion, or the recipe for a good team?

'93 Fleer Ultra, Barry Bonds, Top Glove.      1993 Upper Deck, Nolan Ryan, "The Express' Last Run".      Classic Baseball, Ken Griffey, Jr. (1988).      '92 Fleer Ultra, Ken Griffey, Jr., Seattle Mariners, Outfield.      Score Gold Rush, Frank Thomas, Chicago White Sox (1993).      Dodgers, O-Pee-Chee, Mike Piazza, Catcher (1993).      Skybox, Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan (1990)      If anyone could give me some information on these cards and how much they could be worth, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am currently a cheerleader at my junior high and I do very well and keep up with the other girls. Today when we got to the high school, the coach took us to about a 1.5 mile track and told us, "I expect less than ten minutes. Go." I've never ran a mile before, or attempted it for that matter. It was so painful. I made it, but at the beginning, I was unaware to "pace" myself and ended up walking, running, walking, running about 3/4ths through the run. Cheerleading is an important part of my life, so tomorrow, I want to run a better mile. Any tips for a first time runner?

They will never win a Championship with that stlye of play. People say Nash's assist make him the MVP, I believe it should be KOBE or Nowitzki for MVP.

I won a trophy. We won in overtime. I had over 30 points. Finals MVP. I made a 3 to go into the overtime. Thats where we won. I always played with my friends (most of them are good) and I was good. Every open 3 I got I knocked down. This 1 guy kept talking thrash and I said you shouldnt be because you cant make anything. He said I cant either. Minute later I swished a 3 in his face. The year went on, I stopped practicing (cant remember why) and time by time I didnt make open 3's. I started to suck. A lil half of the year has been gone, I was below average. Barely made any 3's. Now the school year is almost over and Im scared to take a layup, because If I miss it my friends will laugh. A couple of friends got together to play a game, I asked if I can play and they said "ballers only." Earlier in the year they said I can play. They doubted me. Continues....

20070824110935AAjAjO7	Sports;Other - Sports	Is it even possible?	Im entering my senior year in high school and have been playing baseball my entire life. Ive been a varsity starter since my sophomore year. During my junior year i hit .330 at the plate and i started taking the game seriously and ive been working out everyday and hitting.   The only problem is that I havent even been sniffed by a college scout. However this summer i am playing legion ball and hitting .400 and playing solid in the outfield. Its my dream to go and play at a good college and then after college to prolong my baseball career in the big leagues. However I know the odds. If I go on to play at a d2 or d3 college, do I have any shot whatsoever or should I just give up on my dream.   Another problem that I have is my size right now I'm currently 5 10 and only weigh about 150-160 and dont have to much bulk to me.

Dibiase jr. tagged with next generation hart foundation a lot in Southwest, so he would be acceptable. Then go with Harry (DH) Smith, TW Wilson, Natalya (Nattie Niedhart) and then give them either Jericho or Edge (both Hart dungeon alum) as a leader.      I think it would make an awesome faction, and crossovers with Jericho's main event fueds could mean matches like Smith vs. HBK or Dibiase vs. HHH on Raw. I mean a second gen Hart foundation seeking revenge for the screwjob against H and HBK would be good television.      SO would you be psyched for    Jericho    Smith    Dibiase jr.    Wilson   & nattie Neidhart   as the New Hart Foundation, or do they need Teddy?         if nothing else, tell me that you would not mark out like a schoolgirl at least once if these guys all came to the ring in black and purple.

On ECW they have a chance to give a push to 2 really good heels and that is benjamin and morrison. morrison is stuck carrying miz and benjamin is just not getting a push.      So who do you think will be the next main event heel?      wq: WM23 RKO and Edge were in MITB. WM24 both are world champs.

I thought that they couldnt have, because WWE know the amount of young kids that watch it.      HOWEVER! everyone knows that Lita had her bra off, as one of her breasts was seen on camera!      Can anybody tell me what really went on!?..... i wish i was Edge...rofl
