I just got a new box tuned to 38 hz for my pioneer premeirs rated at 800 rms for the pair, and it sounds so much better than my seperate sealed boxes did. My amp is rated at 760 rms bridged. I never smelled coil or felt heat on the subs in my sealed boxes, but with the ported box they are heated to the touch. They seem like they should be able to handle it, I am under-rating the subs with the gain set properly at around 3/4. The amp does not heat up at all, its just the subs since I got the new box. Any ideas for the cause? It sounds amazing compared to the sealed and is properly wired to 4 ohms in a parallel series bridged to the amp. Is this hurting my subwoofers? Seems like the coils could burn up..

The rear camber kit is really simple and it can be adjusted to ridiculous angles. But the front camber kit is limited. it's the upper control arm that the balljoint slides in and out. I put it the furthest out that it can be and my wheels still have a negative camber.  I was wondering if there was anything to pull the bottom Inwards so it straightens up the wheel. because the upper control arm cannot go out any further.  Or anyother way that this could be done. because ive seen other civic really low and they have their wheels straight. THANK YOU

I hit a deer just over a month ago with my 2003 ion I bought last October, after 4,000 worth of damage (thank god for insurance) for repairs with the deer damage I get in my car tonite and the check engine light is on so I take it straight to Auto Zone and they said it is the O2 sensor, the price they quoted me was 135.00 for the part, I am wondering if this is alot and if my dad can change it, he is pretty good with cars, replaces the brake pads, brakes, roters, oil things like that. Do you think he could do it if I would buy the part 1st of all or do you think I should just take it to a shop and have it done? Also, how long can I go with this sensor as is?

I had the car until April 16, 2007 and the engine that I just bought and paid for locked up. I called the shop, and they had it towed back to their shop and that's the last I've seen of the car.  She told me that the engine only had a 30 day warranty, but it locked up before the 30th day, and then on my receipt it says that the business offers a  24 month or 24,000 mile warranty. I just don't know what to do and I'm tired of them blowing smoke up my behind. I've been out of transportation for 6 months, and she feels like she accomodating me in some kind of way.

20081024064343AAUtZTv	Cars & Transportation;Boats & Boating	Should old water pumps on rivers and canals be in good working order?	I love Autumn, I do. There's a slight and fresh chill in the air, and the smell of damp leaves and grass entices me to don cap, boots and my trusty stick and go for a gentle ramble across the fields and navigate my way along the river way nearby, stopping every so often to view the odd rare water bird or Victorian artifact left behind from the old water trading days.   One such item was a large water pump of sorts, used to replenish barges and such.    I thought hello! This thing has been renovated. Indeed it had, complete with a display stand complete with photos and snippets of educational facts and dates. Before me was a large turning wheel. Looks to be in working order this, I thought as I grasped the vast thing with both my clenching fists.   Begad! Stiff old bugger eh? I spat between gritting teeth. I wasn't going to give up without a fight, sod what the Doctors tells me.   Alas, being an old Bulldog of sorts, stubborn and somewhat scornful of Quack's advices the exertion of trying to turn the wheel excited my bowels a tad too much, hence out popped an otter! Slipped down my leg and down the river bank it went. As smooth as you like.   I hastily slipped into a bushel and cleaned myself up with some kleenex and sauntered off as if nothing happened. Anyway, they should of put a sign up saying the pump was a dummy, and not in good bloody working order.

20081111092309AAhArIj	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1996 Pontiac Trans Am Service Engine Soon Light and Low Coolant Light?	The Service Engine Soon light came up this morning and I'm wondering why... the car has fresh oil, fresh coolant, and the gearbox is properly lubricated.  The air filter was a bit dusty, but not filthy.  The other light that is illuminated is the Low Coolant light.  Not sure why that one is on either; coolant is where it should be and it's fresh.  Any ideas as to why these lights are on?  The car has 131,800 miles and is a 6 speed manual shift.
