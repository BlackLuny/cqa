20081121080549AAL6kPq	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Any ideas what may be wrong with my Gram?	Doctor tells her its sinus infection. Haven't done blood or any interest in it. Just keep giving different or more antibiotics. Been going on for 4 weeks. One sided headache over the eye, tingling, electricity like sensation around tender eye. Nasseau, weakness, and extreme exhaustion, falls asleep just sitting. Has never had a cold in years. No congestion yet the Dr. treated like sinus infection.  Treatment does nothing after weeks. Has good days and bad days. Any ideas. I thought lyme disease - which they haven't done any blood on, but she has no fever or swollen lymph nodes (like my son did with his lyme).

Only the gums on the right side of my mouth are swollen. When I woke up today, I had sort of a sore throat and really bad taste in my mouth. The gums on the left side of the mouth are very normal. First I thought it was my upper tooth that was hurting but when I was brushing I realized its my gums as I saw it swollen. The bottom was swollen first and then the upper one got swollen as well. I'm going to go to the dentist this Thursday and I've been going for the past 3 weeks to get fillings. I brush everyday very thoroughly. Anyone know what to do to stop the pain until I see my dentist? Thanks in advance.

20081210051948AAqZ1rs	Health;Mental Health	I have had enough of my life now, i hate everything and everyone and i am drained.?	Since a young age my mother and father have been drug addicts, in the past i never realized how wrong this was.   They never looked after me, and my childhood suffered, as a result i have no Gcse's.   When i was about 14 i met my first love and he stayed with me and my Mum for 4 year's, it was too much too young, bu ti needed someone there as my Mum was never in, My Mum did not care if we slept together, and she did not care if i was being Miss treated by my Boyfriend at the time, he turned almost everyone against me and as a result i became a recluse and never went out of the house, i was paranoid and i felt i could not do anything without him.   He cheated on me, but i took him back several time's, and i feel as though i should have had some guidance from my mother, but it was never there so i just carried on down the path of self destruction until my grandmother came and took me too go and live with her, and my mother moved away,   My boyfriend, my everything, cheated on me with my best Friend and so i thought enough was enough and got rid of him for good, i started working in a hair salon, and gained my confidence back. But i always felt self conscious and shy due to my years of abbuse so i never could hold a job down due to that. Since then i have met freinds who have done me over, i have been bullied and now i dont feel i can have my say due to my grandmother being so strict and set in her way's.   Should i just end my life? i do not know what else to do.

I'm speaking about my own dad, so I'd appreciate no nasty comments towards him.      He smokes the stuff every single day, at all different hours.   Plus he drives - me to uni every other day... and does shopping, etc. Not the safest of drivers.   He seems miserable without it, and every time he's nice and friendly... I know or assume he's stoned, and feel ashamed to even speak back.      I've spoken to him about it before. Him and my mom have argued and fought over it constantly.    But he told me he's happy smoking it. And that's what he wants to do.   It's not like he does nothing for us! He does! that's the thing... it's just his behaveoir, not knowing his mood and having him around the house, looking all dopy, unable to function without it!   I'd rather not live with someone like that.      IF it were on an occasion. or the odd once a week with friends... not that that's good either... BUT then... at least...that would be a whole lot better than by himself, every few hours, every single day. Paranoid without it.   Right?      Do you reckon I should just leave him be?

I have taken numerous psychology classes during my schooling and none have ever talked about treatment for an Antisocial Personality. Are there any?      My mother has Anti-social Personality Disorder. I am having a hard time convincing my siblings that she is beyond help. My mother did horrendous things to us when we were growing up. But my siblings have found "God" and think they can somehow make her better. I know it is a terrible thing to admit, but it is something I have come to terms with. She will never get better. Never. My mother does not have empathy, she has no regard for the law, or anything else.   Just recently she tried to open up credit cards in my sister's name without telling her. Luckily my sister found the credit cards in the mail before my mother got them. I tried to tell her that my mother would have maxed them out and left her the bill without thinking twice about it. My mother went to jail a few years ago because she was conning old couples out of their money, but got off with just a year.   My brother is mentally retarded and on disability. She is trying to get his disability cheques. She really is an evil person.      I just don't know how to explain to them that she is beyond help and that they should cut all contact with her. I have not spoken to her since I was 18 years old (I am 25 now). But I need concrete research to give them, my sister mainly. My brothers caregiver would probably like to read it too.      Help.

I go to the gym 5-7 days of the week, working each muscle group twice a week, and each workout is roughly an hour and a half long. I keep a workout journal to track what I do, and according to the numbers, I am making significant gains, but physically I see no difference at all. The only thing I can think of is my diet sucks. I am in college and do not have the money to buy a lot of food, let alone a bunch of lean meats and stuff for protein.Could that be it, and if so, is it even worth continuing working out then if I won't see a difference for years due to poor eating habits?

20090309184114AAoYg8Z	Health;Men's Health	Is it normal for my boyfriend to masturbate to porn everyday?	I need some advice. My boyfriend just told me that he masturbates to porn everyday. I work full time and I am also a full time student. However, I still find plenty of time to have sex everyday with my boyfriend (give or take a few days). We never go more then 2 day with out it. I even do it when I’m too tired and not in the mood just to satisfy him. I dress up in sexy outfits and frequently ask if he wants a lap dance. All I ask for in return is that he be a little romantic, which is rarely the case.  Anyways in the last couple of weeks he has lost the urge to have sex in the middle of a session (if you know what I mean). Is this normal? He said he is still attracted to me and he doesn’t know why this is happening. Do you think he is no longer fully satisfied with me, or he just wants more sex? If he wants more sex, I told him what he has to do to get it…just be a little more romantic. I would LOVE to have sex more than once a day but is it wrong for me to want to have my back rubbed before or take a nice bubble bath together, drink some wine, or cuddle by the fire first? Maybe I’m just a hopeless romantic and he is just a horny guy that doesn’t want to do that romantic crap, but I told him I’m willing to compromise. I don’t know just the fact that he is masturbating while I’m working is such a turn off, can he not wait until I get home? It is obviously affecting our sex life.      I don’t know what to think about the whole thing anymore, please help!

The past few months my depression has spiked into binge eating disorder and i feel so full and ill everyday, but I still dont know how to stop myself from eating. Will antidepressants make me fatter or will they make me lose weight if i have a binge eating disorder? More specifically, do people lose weight on meds because they don't feel the need to binge anymore, ...or would people gain weight because there's something chemically about the meds that does something to your body to make it gain weight?   also, what are the best choices if I do have depression, a binge-eating disorder, and want to stop it? (i know a doctor would prescribe me what they feel is best but id liek to know options beforehand so that they dont prescribe me something that would make me gain even more weight).    thanks

20090309184954AAvMGxQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Isn't it uncommon to get Alzheimer's at age 29 or 30?	I was told it's exceedingly rare by articles and my neurologist among others to get Early Onset Alzheimer's in your early 30's and rare still to get in your mid 30's.  Also my symptoms came on strong like in one week, and I'm told Alzheimer's is a slow progression.        I'm scared though because for 4 years, or maybe a little less I've been with terrible long term and not so good short term memory.  I mean I remember places, faces, dates, names, what to do with things, where I am, all of the classic AD signs, but I'll lose track sometimes in conversation and it's as if my working memory won't allow me to remember things as well.  I also forget most of what I read especially if it's a book.  My doctor said I had Schizophrenia due to voices, delusions, and more other classic SZ symptoms but I'm still scared.  I'm 32 now and feel like my brain is made out of concrete!      Also I've been getting conflicting reports from the Alzheimer's Association on what is really rare and not to get this disease.  Two people said that age bracket was extremely rare, and one person said it's "not uncommon."  So what do I think?

I started taking a herbal concoction (june/july 2008) to melt the cysts in my ovaries, but i stopped for no apparent reason. the herbal thing would have helped me lose some weight, melt the cysts and start me ovulating again with the aim of getting pregnant. the last time i saw a normal period was in my mid/late teens. i am now 25yrs old!      In the beginning of Feb this year, i started spotting. it lasted for the entire month of Feb with the exception of 2-3 days in the second and third week. Now its March and forthe past 3/4 days i am bleeding heavier. i dont really know what a normal flow is, so to speak, but a tampon full in about 4hours..      Is that a normal flow? Does anyone have a clue as to what's going on? did i ovulate?       am so confused. any personal experiences/advise would be appreciated.

I don't that's the cause, I've been off that medication for months now, and the spasms are getting worse.      What could be causing this, and what should I do?

20090309203206AAdaRhM	Health;Women's Health	Period question....  Would you be happy if you could get rid of it?	I know this sounds like a ridiculous question.  The reason I'm asking this is because I've had the mirena since July.  I bled for 3 weeks straight after it was inserted.  Then a month later I spotted for a day or two.  I haven't had a period since and it's driving me crazy.  I asked the doctor to take it out but since I've discussed getting sterilized she wants me to wait.... then she can take it out at that time.  I'm ready to rip the darn thing out myself.  Anyways, I was talking about this at work today and my co workers all think I'm crazy.... they say they're "jealous" because their periods are so terrible and they'd rather be in my shoes.  So.... if you had the option to make your period go away for good, would you take it?  Am I being crazy for feeling this way (I guess I feel less feminine or that I've prematurely gone through menopause....)  Thanks

20090309200952AAxpW1T	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	My leg (around calf area) feels bruised (i'm doing track)?	So I've been doing track since uhh... January, and I started running, warming up, stretching, etc. etc.   Well my leg starts hurting since like the 2nd week into training. So I just ignore it and run, hopefully it'll go away.. but it doesn't. So During our winterbreak I decided not to go to practice for a week and see what happens, after around 7 days, it still hurts. So now.. my leg still hurts.       This is what it feels like:   When I hop on one leg (either one) I feel like it's all tight but i stretch really well... and it feels like there is a bruise on it but... no bruise is visible. However, if i poke that calf area with two fingers with normal pressure, it feels like a bruise... and then i don't see anything... Help? Also we had to jump over these cones which were around 1 feet high, and I keep knocking them over because I can't jump high enough on one leg because it hurts. I don't think it's a shin split... because i can still run, but when i do the warmup laps and sprints it hurts to run on it like my leg keeps dropping really fast each time i put pressure on one of them... kinda confusing..      Thanks so much... sorry it's so long. I'm planing to go to the doctor... but my appointment is in a week :\ So do you know what it is? How can I deal with it or "Cure" it? I really want to fix this problem because it seems to really be slowing me down x_x. Thanks.

20090309195110AAt2Yvw	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I always feel tired no matter how much sleep I get! Is this a medical issue?	Hello,   I'm an 18 year old male and I find I suffer from fatigue a lot during my everyday life. I usually get from 6 to 10 hours of sleep every night, yet every morning I wake up still tired. I don't have low iron, and I've had my blood tested multiple times to see if I had mono, but it was never the case. I'm fairly active, but the amount of physical activity I do has no affect on this “tired syndrome”. I find that during the day, if I'm not stimulated, I immediately get tired and start yawning, which triggers my nose to start running. I've been dealing with this problem since as long I can remember. I'm a University student, and I have a really hard time listening to my lectures without feeling extremely tired or sleepy. I've tried listening to music in one ear and paying attention to the lectures, but that does not help either. I wanted to get sniffing salt, like what they use for football players, to see if that would "wake me up" when I get like this. I rarely have a hard time falling asleep and I can pretty much fall asleep anywhere. I don’t feel depressed, I’m happy with my life and I go out with friends all the time. I really need help here, or else I'll spend the rest of my life feeling tired!

I have always been a small little thing ever since I was little. But lately going through high school and everything has changed the way I see my self. Recently I'll walk thru the hallways and see girls who are super tiny and have big boobs and they get attention from guys. Who doesn't. But I hate looking down at the scale and seeing it being over 100 pounds. So I started taking my moms diet pills that she has abandened in the bathroom cabinet. The only other person that knows is my best friend and she has started doing the same thing. I have only been taking them for about two weeks now. But I have also changed the way I eat. When I go thru the lunch line at school I wont choose the cheese sticks or the lunch cookies but instead eating only fruit && bananas and what not. I don't want people to tell me Im skinny becuase I have been hearing it my whole life. I just need advice on what to do. I have not become ill from this. Also you cant see my bones I have muscle that makes me look healthy so from looking at me you wouldn't guess I had an eating disorder. But I would just like to know your thoughts on this. So please let me know It really means alot to know people are out there and care.            Sincerely,             Little.miss.lost

I use this medication because it helps me sleep through the night. My doctor wont give me any other type of sleeping pills. Since taking this drug my memory has been very sluggish or I get total blockage of things and people that I should easily be able to recall. The decline in my memory skills started when I began this medication. 30 mg for 3 years and sluggish poor memory. Has anyone else noticed this side effect? This is very trouble some for me. I'm introducing a friend to someone and I've forgotten the friends name. Meal preparation is slower because it takes me longer to remember what is the next step. I have to constantly retrace my steps trying to figure out what was it that I needed in this room. I'm frustrated and want to quit this drug but I dont know what to substitute in its place because without it I cant sleep through the night. Can anyone offer me their suggestion.

20061214132358AABifIb	Health;Other - Health	I'm sick, in my mind?	Hello.   This has been an ongoing problem since I was about seven years old.    I have a fear of throwing up, so whenever I get ill, no matter what it is, I automatically think I'm going to be sick, therefore my mind tricks me into feeling sick.      Recently, I've been getting really bad Diarrhea for no reason. And it usually happens in the day, on a Saturday when I'm at work. I'll be fine by the time I get home, I'll eat a meal, then I'll get it again.      My mum thinks it's a mental thing or something.       When I get a stomach ache, I panic that I'm going to be sick or something.       If someone says they don't feel very well, I instantly feel sick, it's really...really strange. But I think it's some kind of mental problem.      I don't really have a bad diet, I'm slightly overweight, but I'm not big enough for it to be a problem for my digestion or anything.      Forgot to mention, I haven't been sick since I was 11 and I'm 18 now..      So please, if you know anything, Help me!

I am now counting down the weeks until I finally move out of my parents' house and transfer to a university this August. While I am more than excited about this, I'm REALLY starting to worry about what I am going to do about eating.      I'm told that the kitchen facilities in the dorms are, depending on where you are, lacking to non-existent. This only makes so much  of a difference, as I'm effectively "culinarily-challenged" at best.      I've been trying to get in better shape lately; I've been running, lifting, and I'm trying to quit smoking (as it's making the running exceptionally difficult) and this is playing into my apprehension.      I know I'll only be able to afford so many sandwiches from the Subway nearby, so I need suggestions on products that require little-to-no preparation (at most I will probably have a small microwave and if I'm really luck I will have a community stove) that are at least relatively healthy and exceptionally cheap.

Asi que mis chavos, aguas con la leche que diga      LECHE FRESCA.   La unica que es fresca es la que no tenga el numero 1, o que solo aparesca 1 sola estrella.
20070709093034AAIgvaA	Health;Diet & Fitness	I need to lose weight but how much is too much?	I am 24, 5'9 and weigh 250 lbs. I have a large frame. I gained most of my weight through my two pregnancies. Prior to becoming pregnant for the first time, I was 180lbs with 22% body fat, while in the army. I have lost ten lbs in the last month through diet and exercise.    Since my husband is deployed, I decided this is the best time to work on a new me. So, I need to know what range my weight should be in, as I don't want to be too thin but not overweight. I have seen weights ranging from 135-187lbs for my height. I was aiming for about 170-175 but do not know how low to go. Also, I need some advice on how to keep from having hanging skin. I know weight training and firming lotion will help but I do expect to have some loose skin. Any help would be appreciated.

I never have had this problem before and the ibuprofen was prescribed for a knee injury.  After 3 days, I stopped taking this medicine, however, if that is what messed my stomach up, it will not go away.  It is miserable, and now I cannot go out and eat with friends / family without having to make a beeline for home immediately afterward.  I am not positive the medicine caused it, but nothing else happened at that time and I have never experienced acid reflux / heartburn before.  It feels like I have to vomit real bad, you cannot do any sudden moves because you feel like a time bomb, only you never vomit, you just have 1-2 hrs or more of extreme nasuea.  About the only thing I can do is try to go to sleep, when I wake up, it is gone, but I am dreading the next meal.  I have never been a milk drinker, not even in elementary school and I just cannot do it now.  I have  noticed that it doesn't matter what I eat, the end results are the same.  What is this and how can I get rid of it ? thx

20080308014031AAkVlOE	Health;Women's Health	Odds of pregnancy?	To start of with I am on Yasmin and have a horrible sleeping pattern so I do not always take my pills on time (I know stupid). But last week I took my pill about about 2-5 hours late and one day forgot to take it at all until 5am the next morning... so i took it then and took my other one at the time I am supposed to be... last friday my boyfriend and i had unprotected sex (and no i dont need any lecture on it, him and i are 100% monogamous and are both disease-free). All of this week I made sure to take my pill on time or atleast close (maybe an hour off) except for today I forgot and took it 11 hours late... what are my chances that I could be pregnant if any at all? If I am, do not worry there will be no abortion or adoption, he already has a two year old with his ex whom he and i love to death, so no matter how hard it would be to raise another baby in our situation we would do it.
