cTYAYrb9aa	That's such a cute idea! :)<br>  <br>  I would put down a soft yet cheap carpet. Knowing little children, it'll get dirty quickly so don't spend too much on it. <br>  <br>  Buy some of those huge bean bag cushions, they're soft and safe and you could read to your girls when sitting on them. Adding some overhead storage for toys or books is also a good idea. <br>  <br>  As for lighting, you don't want the room to be too dark, the movie stars lighting is a good idea but not too practical, I would suggest a standard light bulb overhead (with a pretty lampshade?) and some small fairy lights to go around the room.<br>  <br>  :) <br>  <br>  Hope I helepd you.

If you have termites, you should see small holes in the dirt under your house and small "trails" left behind by the termites on the wood. You need a professional to treat it because he injects something into the ground all around your house. You also need to pick up every piece of scrap wood from under and around your house to not attract anymore termites.|`|yNE7qzOhaa	If they are swarming in the house it means you have a big problem.  It's not really a do-it-yourself project.  You need a professional.  I would estimate at least $500.  Good luck.
yNE7qzOhaa	Never heard of such a thing.  There are studies about controlling the heights of plants by constantly brushing the tops of the plants (like the wind would do) but stressing it out?  What are you doing to these plants?  There is no male or female tomato everything it needs is on the same plant.|`|H9OFtkeoaa	If you start your plants too early and keep them under lights too long before you start to harden them off they become spindly.  I have never heard of a tomato plant becoming male.  Some watermelon need two different types planted together for the one you want to bear fruit.  They put the seeds for both types in the same pack.  If you find two different sizes of seeds in the pack this is probably the case.|`|1taf83DCaa	This may help you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heirloomseeds.com/tomatoes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heirloomseeds.com/tomatoes.ht...</a>|`|AA11498082	Wow, don't ask your friend to help you in the garden with her "make them male by touching" hands.  Thanks for the grin.<br>  <br>  Tomatoes have male and female parts on the same flower (self fertilizing).<br>  <br>  Touching plants does not change their *blushing grin* sexuality.<br>  <br>  Walking on the same area constantly will stunt plant growth, creating a path...(still laughing about your friend, imagining the furor that will be caused in the plant world because of human hand sex-conversion).

MAKE SURE YOU SHUT OFF THE BREAKER TO THE DRYER BEFORE YOU WORK ON IT. Since the dryer is only a year old see if the warranty will cover the parts and maybe the labor.

You do however must fix any damage done by you or the movers during the move.|`|AA12139345	Check your contract.  <br>  <br>  If there is any kind of clause about it being ready to move into - yes, you need to take care of these things.<br>  <br>  If there is any kind of clause about the condition of the home at the time of sale, then yes, you need to take care of these things.<br>  <br>  If you left a clause in the contract stating the buyer is responsible for new paint, etc - then they will need to take care of the dirty walls, scratched doorways, etc.<br>  <br>  Now -- all that aside - you may want to consider being a 'good neighbor', and taking care of it yourself.  If you got the price you wanted for the home, I would certainly try to make things as nice as possible for the new owner.  If the price dickered to well below what you wanted, and/or fair market value  (those are not always the same), then hopefully you sold the home 'as is' - and you are free to walk away, and the new owner should understand that they bought it with the knowledge they would be required to make any necessary repairs.<br>  <br>  An easy solution, is to hire a cleaning service, to go in while the home is between tenants, to spruce up the place.  A little putty, primer, and a new coat of paint will eliminate most scratches, created from moving furniture.<br>  <br>  I know that whenever we moved (and I've had a lot of practice), the cleaning supplies and vacuum cleaner were always the last things out.  We'd give the home a good thorough cleaning before we handed over the keys - sometimes taking a couple of days to do a really good job.<br>  <br>  Many people expect that when they buy a home, it should be in 'new' condition, and can be quite upset to find that what they actually bought, was a well 'used' property, hehehe.<br>  <br>  Be nice, be reasonable, and be fair.  How would YOU have wanted the house when you were ready to move in?  At the same time, be pragmatic - if you sold it 'as is' - its their home, they can fix it.<br>  Oh - and talk to your Realtor, who helped you draw up the contracts - you paid them to help you with the process, they should be able to advise you on this.<br>  <br>  One final note - if you're taking the 'As Is' stand -- don't get into an argument about it, don't raise your voice, don't be combative.  Just patiently, and kindly explain the house was sold "As Is", they knew it, and its up to them to decide how they want to proceed to fix things to their satisfaction.  The last thing you want to do, is get into an angry shouting match - this could easily end up with you in court over some petty repairs, where it would have been cheaper to fix them yourself in the first place.  In fact, you may want to respond by letter (be careful of the wording of the text, and refer them to the contract where possible)  Kind words will help deflate anger, and you may need to reach a compromise.  At this point - IF you decide to do any work, then HIRE IT DONE, so they cannot accuse you of substandard skills, materials, or work practices.  Receipts from the service you hire to do the  work, will go a long ways in your favor, should this drag out into court.<br>  <br>  One more afterthought -- if you happened to have used a professional moving service - then that company would be responsible for the damage, not you.  Give the new owners the contact information.<br>  And, if they bought any kind of a warranty/insurance on the home, then it should be between them and the warranty provider.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|CXaCUJ5naa	If the buyer saw your home in 100% perfect condition before he /she bought the home, then you need to leave it like they saw it. Once the agreement goes through you are responsible for taking care of their home (It's no longer yours) until they move in. <br>  <br>  If you left trash that the trash people won't pick up, then you need to take it to the dump or recycling center. <br>  <br>  You might mention they can get a 1 year home warranty on the home for about $245 dollars, depending on where you live. <br>  <br>  What if this was you? What if the home you found was 100% the best thing ever, yet when you moved in the people had striped out the wall plugs, the ceiling lights, took down the interior doors and broke the windows? HOW would you feel? Pissed?

Rain can literally wash away topsoil, exposing the roots of plants and causing them to die. A good solution to keeping your ground where it belongs and not running down the slope is to level up the grade.

PRx6j6YQaa	you can apply both at once just make sure that you are not applying weed and feed|`|AKrTZqbKaa	I usually plant the seed first because you can see if there are any spots you missed. It's a little harder when the fertilizer is down as it makes it harder to see the seed. It doesn't matter what goes on first, but for ease I would do the seed first because once you water the lawn the fertilizer breaks down and leaches into the soil. The seed will remain in the soil until it germinates. Have you had your Ph checked in the soil? People don't realize how important lime is for the lawn. If the soil is slightly acidic then all the fertilizer you added gets locked into the soil and the roots starve wasting money and time. The soil should be about 6.5 to 7 on the Ph scale.|`|XgpuXjwtaa	As soon as there is no chance of a hard freeze, apply both at the same time.  Lightly rake the seed into the top 1/2" of soil, so they'll not get washed away or eaten by birds.|`|cbRc11zQaa	"Starter fertilizer" can be raked into the soil as you are preparing it to sow seed.<br>  Most grass seed types will germinate when the constant soil temperature is around 60-degrees F.

MCvC6SwQaa	OMG,,,, the answers you get.<br>  <br>  First,,, the air conditioner, either in the window or a whole house unit is normally considered part of the house with regards to insurance.  Portable units, that have vents through a panel in the window, are not.<br>  <br>  Second,,, if they are covered, has everything to do with the cause of loss.  And the causes of loss covered are subject to your policy.  For example, the most simple and cheapest coverage is a fire only policy.  So,,, only fires are listed as "COVERED PERILS".  The medium coverage is Broad Form coverage, and will include more COVERED PERILS.  The normal highest amount of coverage is from ALL RISK coverage, but this is a misnomer, as not perils are covered on an all risk policy.  YOU HAVE TO READ YOUR POLICY,,, under COVERED PERILS.  Fire, theft, wind, vandelism, are normally covered.  FLOOD, EARTHQUAKE, RIOTS, WAR, CIVIL DISOBEDEANCE, TERRORISM, and damage from dead trees on property you own,,, ARE NOT NORMALLY COVERED.  <br>  <br>  Last point,,, look at the value of the unit, and compare it with the amount of your deductible.  If you have a $500 deductible, and you are talking about a window unit,,,,, it's a wash in the value.

I have used this method to hold safety nets in machinery.|`|AA10097817	There is a piece of hardware that the name escapes me. It is placed around hoses and tightened with a screw driver. Look behind your clothes dryer and see how the vent is attached to the dryer. That thing. They come in all different sizes.|`|944iJNAdaa	I'd look into the attachment devices that hold plastic to greenhouse hoop frames.  Those hold up to pretty good forces, and greenhouses are often made of pvc pipes.  I'm thinking the attachments look like a piece of pvc pipe with a slit on one side, and they snap into place, over the fabric.|`|qkvoAYoeaa	You might try stainless steel compression clamps like for automobile radiator hoses.  These are available at your auto parts store, and most home improvement centers have them (Lowe's) in all sizes.  They will not slip, nor will they rust, and they're re-usable, over and over.  They are quite cheap and come several in a package...|`|BiknmjLsaa	Use ty-raps to hold the net on.It's sold at lowe's in the elestrical area.|`|Wo2JUcQ8aa	Depending on the size of netting you could use a C-Clamp or if possible use a bunch of zip-ties. atleast thats what I used for a batting cage.|`|55d046b6e1947a48fdf4a79994d1975eaa	Cable ties they are cheap if you look around and buy them in bulk packages and if they break you can replace them easy.

HxlTayXIaa	Don't worry about schedules, yet. I'm proud of you for being able to admit that you KNOW you could be helping out. Start small...pick a room. Clean it....clean it good. You'll find that the better something is cleaned, the less dirty it looks the next time you clean it.<br>  Next, pick a room that you, yourself, enter and use every day. (Kitchen, bathroom, your bedroom, etc.) Make THAT room the number 1 priority, that way...if you get an attack of the lazies, you'll at least have THAT room done.<br>  Also, and I'm speculating, here, if Grandma or uncle try to offer money....refuse. It'll make you feel better about pulling your own weight. They'll be proud of you for it, too.|`|OzpHu5RYaa	For my kids they have a different chore that needs to be done everyday except for Sundays.  Sit down with your Grandmother and Uncle and discuss who will be responsible for what.  then write out the days of the week and place a chore or two for that particular day.  Always do it on that day and don't change the chore list.  Put it on the fridge or somewhere where you will see it everyday.  With my kids it is homework first, then chores, then if there is enough time they can play with friends or watch TV.  If you are able to do your chores for the whole month without someone else telling you to do them then treat yourself with something small and inexpensive.|`|E8Us3sA1aa	I am so proud of you wanting to help out!

A mistake that is commonly made is adding water to the mix if the grout has started to set up in the bucket.|`|9YS50OpMaa	Try using a grout hardener. It's an additive purchased from tile supply shops. You add it to the grout mix during mixing. Mix the grout mix to the consistency of thick peanut butter. Worth a try anyways.|`|vEH9II83aa	The making grout has formula like concrete . If you add more or less water your grout become croaky or spongy ,Now to fix that problem with carbide saw ,saw the bad grout and make new paste grout.<br>  (First water ,then add slowly grout powder to it till your mix come to paste form )apply it by special putty knife between tiles and with wet spong clean extra grout around of tiles finally when you finish this operation make a liquorish grout (after 2hours) split on all tiled area with a plastic broom wash all area (grout wash) let dry then after complete dryed ,take a piece of fabric catton and clean all face of tiles  now you will have a glazed tile area that never grout comes out.
1taqxI72aa	First of all, do not use bleach or hot water. Bleach will actually darken the stains, which are usually not from sweat, but from the deodorant/antiperspirant. Hot water will set the stain as will drying it with heat so if the stain is not gone after the first washing, let it air dry and repeat the process. There are several alternatives to using bleach to remove these stains and/or brighten your whites. <br>  You should soak the area/shirt in white vinegar or a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water. Hydrogen Peroxide is a natural bleaching agent which will not add to the discoloring like bleach will. Soak in either solution for 15-30 minutes and then wash the item normally. <br>  As previously stated, do not dry the shirt in a dryer if the stain has not yet come out. Repeat the process. <br>  A paste of baking soda and water can also be applied to the area. Let the paste dry and then wash normally. <br>  The new Oxy-Clean detergent works wonders. Fill a sink with water, adding 2-3 scoops of it. Soak the garment for up to a half an hour. The stain is gone. It really does work.<br>  <br>  White Vinegar <br>  Hydrogen Peroxide <br>  Baking Soda <br>  <br>  Avoid anti-perspirants with Aluminum as the active ingredient, which causes sweat stains in the first place|`|rw1JWixHaa	Soak the clothing items in cold water and white vinegar several hours or overnight. Use approximately 2 cups of vinegar for an average clothes washer tub full of water with only a few items - more for a larger amount of water and a wash load of clothing items.
