20090202193256AAp3Uud	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does your baby move while sleeping? How to avoid his head hitting the crib?	My baby is 1 year old. She usually sleeps with me, but now I want her to sleep in her crib. She usually moves a lot while sleeping, sometimes she sits up in the midnight and falls down, her head hitting against the mattress. However, if she sleeps in her crib, i'm afraid that her head will hit the crib. I don't think the bumper helps much because it just works if she lays down.    Can you suggest what I can do?   Thanks.

20090202193516AAp4Vx6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What is your religion (if one) and why are you that religion?	I am 14. Raised in Louisiana. So as you know, like 80% of everyone is a Christian down here. More than that in my small town, but anyway.. I've been raised in a church. The past year or so, I've been struggling with this. I believe in higher power, and I know there has to be a God, but this whole Jesus thing? Nuh uh. I just don't believe in the bible. I know how it came along and its just like any other religious writings. It mainly depends on how you are brought up. If your raised in a Hindu environment, your going to Hindu. Same with people down here. Most of the people around here say they are Christians, but all of them cuss, smoke, drink, and then go to church on Sunday. I can ask them why they believe in Jesus, and they'll say something like "because the bible says he's real". Ha. Maybe people a couple thousand years later will be worshiping the books Harry Potter, and KNOW its all real just because the book says so. WTF? Then if you don't believe in Jesus, you are such a bad person and are going to hell. I'm fine with Christians. All my friends are Christians, I don't care what religion you are.. But anyway, typed a little too much there. LOL. Back to the question. What is your religion, and why is it your religion, and how do you know its true?

20090202193840AAr3Tv4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I always re-play memories of my ex and me?	Well, to put it short, my ex boyfriend pursued me again after breaking up with me.  We basically were on and off from June-December. We were "on" during winter break but without the label. He even said that he wanted to work things out but we both agreed to hold off on the label. Then another girl comes along; and he totally forgets about me. No contact. No calls, texts, NOTHING. We have not talked for a month now. I don't want him back because he's such a jerk.. and I know that now. I am actually relieved to be rid of him. I have a class with him everyday. Even though I know he is a jerk now, I always think back on when he wasn't a jerk: during the summer. When I hear songs that make me think of the summer and "us", I still get sentimental. I know it's not that long but it was my first relationship and I feel like I should be over it by now, but it is constantly on my mind. I know I should keep busy, and I have been, but I'm always constantly re-playing great memories between us in my head and it's getting old. Any idea on how to cope with this? (BTW-I'm 17).

20090202194519AAPPXIC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	How did you and your significant other choose your baby's name?	Just a fun little question out of curiosity's sake :)   How did the 2 of you decide what your baby's name was going to be?      For ours we decided to both pick our favourite boy and girl name and one would be the first name and one would be the middle name based on what order they sounded better in.      The name I chose for a girl was Aisling and for a boy I chose Connor.    The name he chose for a girl was Kadence and for a boy he chose Aiden.   If we had a girl her name was going to be Aisling Kadence and if we had a boy we decided it was going to be Aiden Connor.      And we had a girl so Aisling Kadence it was :)
20090202194304AAP1mPr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much does your partner help you with your child(ren)?	We have 2 boys, ages 4 and 5 months. My husband recently got laid off, so he's home pretty much all the time. For a while he was really great about helping me with the boys. Now he hardly does anything!       Both of the boys are sick and our youngest has been waking up 2-3 times a night (normally he sleeps through the night). Then he still wakes up around 7 like he always has. My husband won't get up with him at all. Normally, I get up with him during the night and my husband gets up at 7 with him so I can get a bit of extra sleep in the morning. Now, my husband sleeps all the time and plays in front of the computer.       He's driving me crazy! I mean I know he's depressed about losing his job, but jeez, I'm not exactly a ball of sunshine either. I don't see why I have to be the sleep deprived one.       Sorry this kind of turned into a rant. Anyone else going through this? Am I being selfish or am I justified in being mad?

20090202194744AA89rEF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could it be implantation bleeding and cramping?	I'm 10 DPO and have been having some symptoms like sore breasts, very tired, lower back hurts, among other things. I figured I was just reading into it too much. Today I woke up with cramps. They felt similar to AF cramps, but then got worse, but that only lasted for a few minutes. Then I noticed I was spotting (brownish/pinkish and only when I wiped). Figured AF was coming so didn't give it any more thought. I'm still having the cramps but not bleeding at all. Could this be implantation? I know I should just test, but I was trying to wait until I missed my period.

I am a 24f, married, and been struggling with an eating disorder for about 6 years. I have gone up and down in weight since then, and have not had a period in the last year till last month. I am only 100 pounds.. 5'8. I tried to get pregnant a couple years ago, when I was around 130 ( during one of my recovering times) and never did get pregnant.. and then I lost weight again.      Now: Some how I started my period last month after a year of not having it, and I am still way underweight,, so that is kind of weird. Well I had sex this month when I was ovulating ( I think I was becuz II had the thick clear liquid that you get while you are ovulating). Now a week later my nipples are sore, and my urethra is always tingling. It's to early to test, but are those signs of pregnancy?????? Could I be? Even though I am 30 pounds underweight..

20090202141600AAjBrYF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Flying with toddlers?	I am going to be taking my two children (ages 2 and 4) on a trip to Florida with me to visit my family. I will be by myself and am a nervous wreck about the whole thing. Does anyone have any good suggestions about what to bring or activities to do with them during the flight? They are really well-behaved kids, so I am not worried about them screaming and fighting. The trip is only going to be about two hours.      Also, will the airline allow me to bring a portable DVD player on the plane? I was thinking of picking this up for them to watch a movie in flight:  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... 
20090202142252AABLK05	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	1st baby, how far along when you felt it move?	I'm currently 14 wks along with my first baby. Most books say you can feel the first movements between 16 and 23 weeks, which is a big stretch! I know that first time moms don't feel it as soon as those who've been pregnant before, but when did you first feel your first baby move? I'm a bit overweight (not alot) and I have some skin on my tummy. Will the extra skin delay how soon I feel it moving?

Okay so I passed out twice last month, both times before I had my period...My period is 40 days apart, last month it was 52 days..Well my period was actually pretty light..I took a pregnancy test just to be sure, it was negative, so theres lil chance that I am pregnant, unless I am very early on now..      Random times my heart would like race and I would feel lightheaded..Hasnt happened for a couple weeks...      I keep getting sick, and I bruise easily..I was running in the snow that had like half of an inch of ice, and it did hurt but not much, and now my legs have bruises like everywhere it looks like someone punched me 10 times on my legs...      My friend said that I could be pregnant and anemic, because pregnant women have a higher chance to become anemic...If thats not it that what could it be?

20090202140207AAHUVQb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My poor baby is sick.. please help?!?	I took my daughter to the doctor this morning. She was running a 101.6 temp and barely keeping anything down. The doctor told us that she had some white spots on her throat and she was a little congested and that he was going to treat it as bronchitis. Which I think is wrong. She would be coughing her head off if it were bronchitis. My daughter's original doctor wasnt in and we had to see another one. Which he was nice but you can tell he had no idea what was wrong with my little angel. Anyways he put her on an antibiotic and some cough and congestion medicine. We have gave her a dose of each and she ended up throughing it up. Now Im up with her because she was gagging in her bed and she threw up a little. She is not wanting to keep anything down. I dont know what else to do. I feel like Im loosing my mind. Being tired isnt helping much. I have had maybe a hour of sleep in 25 hours. I dont know if I should get some chicken broth and give that to her. Or some chicken noodle soup. My daughter will be a year old on thrusday. Her party is suppose to be on wednesday and from the looks of things we are going to have to cancel. I dont think she is going to be better by then well at 100 %. The doctor told us that if my daughter isnt starting to get better in 24 hours then we are suppose to go back. I do know that Im going to keep bugging them until they figure out correctly what is wrong with my baby. She is suffering and I cant take it knowing that there isnt really much I can do to help. Any advice or known home remedies for this?? Thanks in advance!

Last friday a fight broke out outside the pub and i got arrested. My mates ran back to my flat to tell my pregnant girlfriend and she started crying hysterically. They brought her into the police station and it broke my heart to see crying as bad as she was. They released me without charge as i wasn't in the fight. However when i walked over to her in the police station and wrapped my arms around her, she was crying still and shaking like a leaf. I held her tight to try and get her to stop shaking. We got into my mates car and headed back to out to our flat. When we got in we headed straight for bed, i got into bed and she was still sobbing i held her until she fell asleep, but i couldn't believe how upset she got. The next day i was off my work on holiday for 2 weeks and when i said i was going to the shop for milk she started crying again begging me not to leave her so i told her to come with me. She cant walk easily so it took us ages plus it was snowing i know that she is doing in because she is scared but i need some alone time. Please advise me. Do any of you men have women in this situation.
20090202141948AARt0hu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My children are accusing me of favouritism?	I have four children, and in my family the older two (Aged 10 + 7) are really close and the younger 2 (aged 4 + 2) are really close. My four year old is struggling with her speech and is thought to be very dyslexic, she attends speech therapy and often gets teased by her older siblings Jason (7) and Isabelle (10).I think that without realising it Jason and Issy gang up on her i tell them to back down and i try and explain the situation to them but they don't understand.  I know this must knock Delilah's confidence as her "buddy" Keiran is 2 and can't really stick up for her. In October Delilah started striking out at Keiran and i'm pretty sure that it was because of Issy and Jason's little comments and mocking her speech. So ever since then i've been giving her extra praises and doing extra little things to try and boost her confidence back up and to some extend it's working, for example when Keirans sleeping and Issy and Jason are in the garden myself and delilah will have a hot chocolate and read a book etc      Now however Issy and Jason are accusing me of favouring Delilah, i've told them many times that i love them all the same and that they're all really special to me however they now seem to be convinced that i love Delilah the most. As for the comments towards her it's less about her speech but more about "mummys pet" and " goody goody " and when i hand out the biscuits for example lets say i give Issy her's first she'll say" oh no give it to Delilah first she can't do without being your favourite"      Me and my husband have been getting really fed up and we reminded them that Delilah has trouble speaking and grasping things and that we're just giving her a little extra help but still they don't seem to understand      It really hurst me as well, and i find myself crying about it although i am pregnant so it might just be me being hormonal!      Has anyone experiences this, will it end its been going on since ( the "favourtism" December) What can i do?

Most of the time she is playing while it is on but i really want to have her stop asking to watch it all the time.

How do i get her to forget about hi-5? distracting her at home doesnt work cos even if we go into her playroom to play she still wants it on so she can listen to it.

I hadn't started my period again, so we went back in to the doctor to see what was wrong. Apparently, I'm pregnant again. It was absolutely unexpected and we were both completely stunned.   And so now I'm excited and apprehensive for this new baby, especially because I haven't even had time to really grieve over losing Jolie not that long ago. My fiance has already gone to picking names and stuff and he's been trying to get me to join in with him, just to my mind off of everything. I'm five weeks today with this one.   This are the names we've found so far. What do you think?   The ones with arrows by them are the ones I like the most.

20090202161434AA9cyU8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Single parenting with first time baby?	Hello, I know this is quite a common way of parenting, but I am curious how testing it will be. I realise everyone has different tolerance / patience / stability levels and income etc which would change how tricky it is... But I am considering moving to a state away from all of my friends and family because they haven't been very supportive of my pregnancy. Will this make caring for my baby much harder do you think - If I don't have any familiar people around? I feel as though it is important though to get away from the people who won't acknowledge that I'm having a baby. Thank you :)

This did happen with my first pregnancy and i had him less than a month later so i dunno if one thing leads to the other or if the baby can be in that position and still make it to the due date.      2) Is feeling pressure on my cervix and bottom and also cervical pain normal around this time (31 weeks pregnant)?      3) (TMI) i was unable to have sex with my husband because it hurt sooooooo much. has that happened to anyone? i think i've heard that's normal but it hurt sooooooooo sooooooooo much lol. any advice?      so thank you all very much for any input. i go to my doctor on wednesday so i'm going to ask her all this then but any advice before then would be appreciated.       thank you!!

While he looks at me he scowls and give a dirty look...      What does he think of me? Well, he did call me a b.i.t.c.h /s.k.a.n.k on msn a few months ago at 1am in the morning so I don't know if he was drunk or if he meant it. he called me a n.i.g.g.e.r when I'm even black.   Could he still think that of me ?

20090202144002AA1nO9c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Any suggestions on how to get my daughter to slow down...?	My daughter does so much all the time.. She is taking advanced classes, she is on the yearbook staff, she takes dance lessons, music lessons, she is on a cheerleading team.. plus she is involved with our church youth group, being the secretary of her age group. Her activities don't stop during the summer either, she goes to a summer camp as a counseler, plus she has her cheer camps.. and her dance lessons double as well as her music lessons. Next year she is going to be a freshman in high school. She has informed us that she is joining the dance/cheer team there (meaning competitions through out the year and all football and basketball games and most wrestling matches), she is signed up to take honors classes for every subject, she is doing the morning announcements, she is joining leadership, she wants to join FFA, and she wants to keep doing all the other activities she is currently doing. Currently she only gets about 6 hours sleep at most. How can I get her to slow down a bit and not take on such a huge load? I realize that I can just tell her no and forbid her to do some of the things but I feel like it would be wrong and that I would be a bad mother... Any suggestion?
20090202155622AAeamTE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im not sure...could i be pregnant or could it be something else?	Okay so on the 24th and 25th of January i had unprotected sex...yes i know dumb thing to do. I took the morning after pill on the 25th.      He ejaculated in me about five times over the 24th and 25th.      On the 31st of Jan and 1st of Feb we used a condom but it slipped off right before he came inside me. That was on the 31st   he came inside me three more times over those two days before i took a morning after pill on the 1st of Feb.      I know its really bad...i completely understand that, now ive either screwed up my cycle or im pregnant so i need some info please.      My period was due on the 29th of Jan its now the third and im willing to say that ive missed it completely, we're beyond the point of being late i think.      I took a pregnancy test on the 2nd but it didnt work. i will take another on the 6th because thats the next time i will be near the chemist to get one.      What do you think....is it possible to have screwed up my period with all of the hormones?      Or do we have a bigger problem on our hands?      Thanks in advance.
20090202162630AA8M2i9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can i lie to my bf about going on the pill?	Im going to go on the pill as soon as i can....because ive had way to many pregnancy scares in the three months that ive been with my bf.      But if i go on the pill he will think its completely fine, and that he doesnt have to wear a condom anymore.      Do you reckon i could get away with not telling him that im on the pill, so that he will still wear a condom..because i want to be protected.      I dont want to get pregnant right now....      Im in the middle of a pregnancy scare at this very moment.      But he hates wearing condoms...he will because i ask him and he knows he wont get any if he doesnt....but is there any really safe periods while im on the pill that will reduce my chances of pregnancy even more...so that we can have sex without a condom...      Neither of us has any stds what so ever...i can guarantee it....so we dont have to worry about that.      Thanks

I'm 28 weeks and 4 days pregnant and last night I was having what I'm pretty sure were BH contractions for the first time. They went on for nearly an hour and I grabbed a water and went to lay down in bed. I was laying there and got very very painful sharp pains in my mid upper back. It hurt so bad to the point where it made me want to puke. It would get better for a few seconds and then get worse again. It didn't happen too long but it did freak me out. I continued to drink water and fell asleep. When they talk about back contractions is it up high like that or lower? I always thought it would be very low. I haven't called my doctor's because it didn't happen again and LO has been very active so I'm not too worried. Any ideas on what it was all about?

As I was at the check out, getting all my things out of the cart and the clerk was scanning stuff.    I noticed that she had a grumpy look about her... and I thought yay I get the grumpy one.     Anyway, as she was scanning my 'goods' she held up the formula and said "this stuff is so expensive isn't it" and I thought, ok maybe she isn't grumpy, and I replied "yes it sure is, but it's a necessity."   Then she made me angry by saying "too bad you aren't breastfeeding, it's much better...you know for your baby"  I think for a second I wanted to badly grab her little walmart apron and choke her with it...but instead I said "Thanks for the tip" and she shrugged!

20090202164156AA22ita	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	The 'Middle Wife' .................?	The 'Middle Wife' by an Anonymous 2nd grade teacher                I've been teaching now for about fifteen years. I have two kids myself, but the best birth story I know is the one I saw in my own second grade classroom a few years back.                When I was a kid, I loved show-and-tell. So I always have a few sessions with my students. It helps them get over shyness and usually, show-and-tell is pretty tame. Kids bring in pet turtles, model airplanes, pictures of fish they catch, stuff like that. And I never, ever place any boundaries or limitations on them. If they want to lug it in to school and talk about it, they're welcome.                Well, one day this little girl, Erica, a very bright, very outgoing kid, takes her turn and waddles up to the front of the class with a pillow stuffed under her sweater.                She holds up a snapshot of an infant. 'This is Luke, my baby brother, and I'm going to tell you about his birthday'                'First, Mom and Dad made him as a symbol of their love, and then Dad put a seed in my Mom's stomach, and Luke grew in there. He ate for nine months through an umbrella cord.'                She's standing there with her hands on the pillow, and I'm trying not to laugh and wishing I had my camcorder with me. The kids are watching her in amazement.                'Then, about two Saturdays ago, my Mom starts saying and going, 'Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!' Erica puts a hand behind her back and groans. 'She walked around the house for, like an hour, 'Oh, oh, oh!' (Now this kid is doing a hysterical duck walk and groaning.)                'My Dad called the middle wife. She delivers babies, but she doesn't have a sign on the car like the Domino's man. They got my Mom to lie down in bed like this.' (Then Erica lies down with her back against the wall.)                'And then, pop! My Mom had this bag of water she kept in there in case he got thirsty, and it just blew up and spilled all over the bed, like psshhheew!' (This kid has her legs spread with her little hands miming water flowing away. It was too much!)                'Then the middle wife starts saying 'push, push,' and 'breathe, breathe. They started counting, but never even got past ten. Then, all of a sudden, out comes my brother. He was covered in yucky stuff that they all said it was from Mom's play-center, (placenta) so there must be a lot of toys inside there.'                Then Erica stood up, took a big theatrical bow and returned to her seat. I'm sure I applauded the loudest. Ever since then, when it's show-and-tell day, I bring my camcorder, just in case another 'Middle Wife' comes along.                Now you have two choices...laugh and close this page or pass this along to someone else to spread the laughs. I know what I did!!!                Live every day as if it is your LAST chance to make someone happy!

Keeping in mind....it is normal to be worried about your unborn child, I understand that, and would have given anything to see my son on a weekly basis, with the exception of blatantly lying.      But I just don't think it's fair on the public health system when people start to back it up...through lying!   Or the women waiting for theirs....and it turns out an 'emergency' scan has had to take place at the same time the normal scan are.

20090202165317AAQQN1X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Posting again because i didn't really get any answers before?	ok i'm 31 weeks pregnant. i am pretty sure that my baby's head is set in my pelvic area and has been for like a week. i can feel her hiccups in my crotch and i keep feeling pressure whenever i'm sitting down. i had my son at 35 weeks so any little thing makes me start to think i'm gonna have my daughter prematurely.      anyway my questions are...      1) Is 31 weeks pregnant a bit early for my baby's head to be engaging? This did happen with my first pregnancy and i had him less than a month later so i dunno if one thing leads to the other or if the baby can be in that position and still make it to the due date.      2) Is feeling pressure on my cervix and bottom and also cervical pain normal around this time (31 weeks pregnant)?      3) (TMI) i was unable to have sex with my husband because it hurt sooooooo much. has that happened to anyone? i think i've heard that's normal but it hurt sooooooooo sooooooooo much lol. any advice?      so thank you all very much for any input. i go to my doctor on wednesday so i'm going to ask her all this then but any advice before then would be appreciated.      thank you!!

20090202181653AAt1Gb5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PREGNANT OR AUNT FLOW? **Help please**?	Hi everyone!      I ovulated on Monday January 19th. And had intercourse the 18th (day before), 15th and the 13th.   All last week I thought I was having pregnancy symptoms. My breasts were heavy, a little swollen, and a little sore. I had some nausea, and a little cramping.      I've also been keeping track of my BBT, and before I ovulated it was anywhere from 96.2 - 96.8. And now its anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7. I've been surprised to see it at 97.9 for a few days.      Normally I dont get nauseated or swollen/tender/heavy breasts before my period. Just some usual cramping.      The past 3-4 days now, I have not had sore breasts at all. I was a little nauseated and light-headed this morning tho. I also had killer cramps this morning too. I had to take some Tylenol to ease the pain.   Is it normal to get cramps like that during early pregnancy?      I'm supposed to start my period today or tomorrow, but there's no sign of it yet. Except maybe the cramping.         I wasn't stressing about being pregnant or anything. Just excited.      I thought for sure I was pregnant. But maybe I was wrong? Does this mean I'm not pregnant? AF? :(         What do you think?   Advice or Help would be appreciated :)   Thank you.

20090202181045AAXwaqB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I see a psychologist?	have a problem with lying. Somtetimes to the point where I believe my own lies and have to remind myself they are not true. Like I told a friend I had to drop out of a music contest because there were auditions and I wasn't good enough then I started to cry not because I wanted her to believe me/feel sorry for me but because I felt like it actually happened. I have pretty much made up a total peersonality life styles one of the top contributors in the parenting section is me a 16 year old girl. I mean I will take an event that never happened and add so much detail that everyone believes it. I also lie to get out of trouble even going so far to plant items to make it seem like im telling the truth. But im starting to scare myself- today I made up this story about me moving to new york and even made up a school name and talked about how my dad was moving for a better job- were not going anywhere. But I also make up lies that I got in trouble and punish myself for them- and I mean really weird sh*t that I would never do. I have a journal with about 200 lines saying I won't disrupt the class- never got in trouble EVER! Then Like I was telling my friends how I accdently sent my karate teacher an email with lots of bad language and insulting her- never did. I did 500 pushups on my own acord and wrote an "apology letter". Then I always change detail around for different groups to make me sound better like one tournament i ranked 3rd out 4 same tournament I ranked 1 out of 25. Should I see a doctor because im scaring myself.

20090202180928AAM0SOA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My 3 year old had surgery thursday. ?	My 3 year old had surgery thursday. She had her adenoids taken out and tubes puy in both ears. The sugery alone went off without a hitch and she was feeling great that day and the day after. And she would experience very little to no pain at all.       The doctor did inform us that the adenoids were infected and that she would be given a dose of Zithromax while she was still in the hospital.    Starting saturday morning we noticed that she couldn't lift her chin and put her head back and she would starting screaming saying that her brain hurt. I didn't think anything of it the first time...she did just have surgery. Well throughout the day saturday she wouldn't lift her chin and would complain about her brain hurting. All day and night saturday this is going on, so i called the doctor saturday evening to ask about it...and got nothing. He said that he thinks it's nothing and just keep an eye on her. Well sunday comes around and she can't move her head at all. So we took her to the Emergency Room  and they did a CAT scan and blood work and everything came back just fine. Meningitis was ruled out and i we were told to follow up our family doctor in 48 hours. She's still going through this.       I know this is long, has anyone experienced anything like this before?? I never have, i guess i'm just looking for someone with a similar experience. I'm doing everything i can to keep her comfortable. Motrin and Tylenol every 3 hours and a heating pad on the back of her neck. Anything would be helpful. Thank you.

Its harder then I ever imagined. Does anyone have any ideas? It doesnt have to be one NEVER heard of but hardly ever would be nice.         Im hoping to use the middle name Ann (Both Grandmas middle) Thank you again so so much!

20090202132532AAyubjB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long should we wait after D & C ?	My husband and I lost our first pregnancy at 10 weeks, 4 days ago. It was a very early missed miscarriage, but my body carried on like nothing was wrong until 10 weeks. We had one doctor, a family doctor, tell us to wait 3 months to try and get pregnant,  and another one, the one who set up the D & C,  told us to go ahead whenever we are ready, b/c my body won't get pregnant until its ready.  What are doctors main reasons for telling people to wait, emotional or physical? We want to try as soon as possible, but are not sure what to do at this point, with 2 different opinions. I had super-light bleeding since the D & C, just really light pink on the TP for the first 2.5 days (Sorry, TMI) and now, nothing. I am also on antibiotics for a week. No one told us how long to wait for sex either, so I am not sure how to handle this one. I know people on here aren't doctors, I'm just looking for peoples opinions and experiences. Thank you so much to whoever answers.

20090202134457AA0urNn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I get my daughter to take a bottle or eat baby food?	My daughter is my 3rd child and was born with her tongue sticking out.  When the doctor tried to suction her, she started to suck on the tube.  I was breastfeeding her within 1/2 hour.  She was a natural.  She is always wiggling, twisting and sticking out her tongue.  She can even turn it upside down.  She is a very oral baby.   I tried introducing a bottle multiple times a day for several days at around 5 month.  She wouldn't take it.  A couple weeks later, I tried introducing baby food.  At 7 1/2 months, she still has the reflex to push everything out of her mouth.    I have tried a sippy cup, she gags.   I have tried to wait until she is hungry, she screams for an hour refusing everything except my breast.   I have tried to give her a bottle between feedings, she just chews on it.   I have about 6 different types of bottles.  I am currently just breastfeeding her and giving her a toy in her high chair to sit with us at meal time so she can watch.  She is very healthy at 29 inches and 21 pounds.  However, I need to be able to leave her for more than 4 hours soon.

Well my little man is 14 months (12 corrected) and he has:      eggs and toast or waffles or some kind of warm cereal for breakfast with 2 oz of OJ and 5 oz of milk.      Mid morning snack- A fruit snack      Lunch he had lunch meat (he loves turkey and ham), cheese and 5 oz of juice      Afternoon snack- Gerber puffs (the "cheetos" or puffs)      Dinner he has whatever I'm making for myself and daddy. and 5 oz milk      He always has oatmeal before bed because he has a bit of a stretch between dinner and bed time.      My son is 31.5 inches long and 23lbs. He looks like he could use to gain a couple pounds, but his doctor said he has just the right amount of fat on him...Well when his shirt is off and he's stretching for something, I can see his little ribs....      Am I feeding him enough or do you think the doctor may have been wrong? Mommy opinions.    Thanks~

20090202200616AAd5UAC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	A New Look On Giving Birth?	MY FRIEND E-MAILED THIS TO ME, I THOUGH YOU GUYS MIGHT LIKE IT =)         The 'Middle Wife' by an Anonymous 2nd grade teacher             I've been teaching now for about fifteen years. I have two kids myself, but the best birth story I know is the one I saw in my own second grade classroom a few years back.             When I was a kid, I loved show-and-tell. So I always have a few sessions with my students. It helps them get over shyness and usually, show-and-tell is pretty tame. Kids bring in pet turtles, model airplanes, pictures of fish they catch, stuff like that. And I never, ever place any boundaries or limitations on them. If they want to lug it in to school and talk about it, they're welcome.             Well, one day this little girl, Erica, a very bright, very outgoing kid, takes her turn and waddles up to the front of the class with a pillow stuffed under her sweater.             She holds up a snapshot of an infant. 'This is Luke, my baby brother, and I'm going to tell you about his birthday'             'First, Mom and Dad made him as a symbol of their love, and then Dad put a seed in my Mom's stomach, and Luke grew in there. He ate for nine months through an umbrella cord.'             She's standing there with her hands on the pillow, and I'm trying not to laugh and wishing I had my camcorder with me. The kids are watching her in amazement.             'Then, about two Saturdays ago, my Mom starts saying and going, 'Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!' Erica puts a hand behind her back and groans. 'She walked around the house for, like an hour, 'Oh, oh, oh!' (Now this kid is doing a hysterical duck walk and groaning.)             'My Dad called the middle wife. She delivers babies, but she doesn't have a sign on the car like the Domino's man. They got my Mom to lie down in bed like this.' (Then Erica lies down with her back against the wall.)             'And then, pop! My Mom had this bag of water she kept in there in case he got thirsty, and it just blew up and spilled all over the bed, like psshhheew!' (This kid has her legs spread with her little hands miming water flowing away. It was too much!)             'Then the middle wife starts saying 'push, push,' and 'breathe, breathe. They started counting, but never even got past ten. Then, all of a sudden, out comes my brother. He was covered in yucky stuff that they all said it was from Mom's play-center, (placenta) so there must be a lot of toys inside there.'             Then Erica stood up, took a big theatrical bow and returned to her seat. I'm sure I applauded the loudest. Ever since then, when it's show-and-tell day, I bring my camcorder, just in case another 'Middle Wife' comes along.

Ok, I am 20 weeks with a little boy and I will breast feed for a month or two but due to medications that is the limit (I chose to be off the medication for 2 extra months so my little man can get the colostrum). What I want to know is exactly what I will need...      Bottles? how many? what sizes are necessary?       Clothes? exactly what sizes for the first 6 months? (I am unable to shop for baby clothes where I live so the only chance to get clothes will be when we go away to have him. He will be a winter baby (In Australia) born in June.       I have a cot, change table etc. I don't need to buy any of that.      But what about sheets and blankets, how many sets should I have, like how many bottom sheets, blankets, trow rugs?      We will be using a bassinet so how many sheets and blankets should we get for that?      What about safety? Is it really important to have a monitor? we don't have a huge house but the walls are rather thick? When would you put catches on the cupboards?       We are using cloth nappies/diapers (my mother has already got them lol) what do we need for them, liners? etc.      Anything you can think of PLEASE. I'm going out of my mind,      What toys would you get for a new born? links if possible.      Sorry for asking so much, it just hit me that I'm half way there and according to my medical condition and family history he could be here any where after 30 weeks so that may only give us 10 weeks to get ready, I am hoping and keeping my chin up that he will be full term and there is no problems so far, I just really want to be ready just in case.

20090202192740AANVyRN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do I discourage bad school work from my kindergartener?	My 6 year old has been doing worse and worse in school ever since she came back from Winter vacation. Compared to the beginning of the year, it's like she has taken 20 steps back. I have tried many, many ways to encourage good work by offering rewards of trips, etc. I have made charts to track her "good" work, but so far I have yet to put down ONE mark of a good paper.       Then when I try and talk with her about school, the only answers I get are 'I don't know.' She can't tell me what she learned, what she did, or anything. Little things like talking with her friends on the bus, playing at recess, etc she can tell me about. However when I ask her what the teacher said about her writing and work, or what she had for lunch, I get a shrug. We already suspect she may have ADD and/or dyslexia (runs in the family), but until we can get her evaluated (in the next few months) I need to know of some ways to get her back on track.      Please no critiquing my beliefs or parenting style. If you had a child that you could see deteriorating everyday in terms of mental ability, then you'd be worried too.

20090202135357AAkB6Yy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When is the earliest you can take a pregnancy test and get a reliable answer?	I am 4 days from my period and wanting desperately to know if I might be pregnant this time. I am having all the signs of my period but hoping and praying it is a baby this month.  My last period began around Jan. 8th and I am usually 29 days or so.I think I ovulated late on day 17 (Jan. 24th)or so but not sure. My husband and I used no protection this month and had sex 4 times during the week I think Iovulated. I have been cramping for the last 2 days so I am a little nervous that it is just period cramping but looking for opinions. I know no on out there can tell me that I am pregnant. But am I crazy to think I could be?

20090202201946AADFr7F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Very opinionated, invasive parents?	In the past few months, I've had several occasions where parents were very harsh critics and very judgmental of other people's parenting skills.      For instance, I've witnessed other women berated for not breast feeding their child.     Or children who are spanked versus timed out.   Or children who eat organic.       I dunno.  I feel like there's no manual on how to raise a child--and I don't pretend to know what's best for anyone else's child.  I can't imagine telling someone that they MUST breast feed.        Have you ever encountered people like this?  Have you ever been the offender?  How do you respond?

My parents are somewhat judgmental and not too respectable when it comes to people who never wants kids. I think the overwhelmingly majority of people or society doesn't.      Me and my wife live in a childfree arrangement, have been married for 8 years. My parents have recently been asking me why I don't have kids yet. I would go off and say that I personally resent kids. They said the reason why people get married is to have kids. Little did they know that I've already been "fixed".      How can I get my parents to lay off on me and my wife's relationship on this issue? Would you have a problem if your kids chose to never have kids?

20090202135042AAkROGg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What would you do, Try or wait Would like opinions?	I am a 24 year old woman with a three year old son who has high functioning autism. I am married and the relationship is good.  I had thought about this last year about having another child. I would love to have another one, and my hubby does too.  Now my husband's job is steady, but we barely make enough it seems to take care of us and our son. We live in a two bedroom apartment which isn't ideal, but what we have to live with for now. My son's in the middle of potty training.. and is going to a special Pre-k at the public school. He's not verbal and uses limited hand signs. I also only have periods about twice a year, and use the Mirena IUD. Trust me.. even three years later, I still remember the hospital, the formula costs.. diapers, sleepless nights.. . So I'm not fooled about what life is like after baby..My life is busy as it is. I also want to go back to school when hubby graduates this summer with his Masters. We were thinking once he gets out of diapers (at least during the day) and talking.. we could.. Should I wait or have another child now? What would you do?

20090202135104AAjQ6oh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding help please?	My baby is 6 days old.  The first 2 days he breastfed wonderful!  Everything was great.  He got jaundiced and refused to eat and just slept all day. His levels were high, so the doctor told us to supplement his diet with formula.  So, we had to introduce the bottle in order for him to get better.  He now refuses to eat from my breast.  He will latch on, but will not suck.  He sucks once or twice.. then comes off because there is no milk coming out like the bottle does.  Is there ANY way I can get him to take my breast again?  His bilirubin levels are way down now, and we no longer need to do the formula, however the only way he will eat now is from a bottle.  I have a GREAT milk supply so he's doing breast milk from the bottle now.  Just wanted to make it a little easier by having him breastfeed instead of me pumping every 2 hours then in turn feeding him with the bottle.  Is there any hope on getting him back on the breast, if so what can I do/try?  Thanks!

20090202135423AAr9bEg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it wrong to get an epidural?	At 18, I gave birth. I was in labour for about several hours.      I waited a long time, the latest allowed before getting an epidural. I thought it over and over and at the urging of my mid-wife I got the epidural. I was able to sleep.      The next morning I woke up I could feel everything, the pain and pushing and I gave birth to my baby. It was not at all hard.      Looking back on it now at age 22, I wish that I had no medicinal intervention, I actually feel like a coward to some extent.       I felt myself giving birth but I had an epidural so I know my birth was not natural.( without medicine)      But I promise that for the next 5 kids I will go all natural no medicine.      I was very young, and did not have the mentality that I do now.      Do you think I was wrong to get an epidural?
20090202135507AAcOYED	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I have gotten pregnant?	Okay so, I came off the pill about 3 months ago & we've been having unprotected sex ever since, because we're trying to conceive. Anyways, I had my period, everything was normal, & then 2 weeks later got the egg white, gummy discharge, everything was pretty normal. We did not TTC at that point because he was away for a bit. Then about a week before my expected period, & a week after ovulation, I got the egg white, creamy kinda discharge again, & then we had unprotected sex quite a few times during that day & quite a few times 2 days after that. I was supposed to get my period yesterday, & it never came. Usually it's earlier then expected, but this time it's later. Which is completely normal too. Yesterday & today I've had the whitish, thick discharge I get when I'm ovulating [usually comes before the egg white discharge & follows the egg white discharge]. I know this is pretty confusing but I really need help. I've heard of women being extremely fertile after coming off the pill for the first few months & going through double ovulation & getting pregnant.    I've also heard of getting this milky discharge when you're pregnant & always being well, wet down there when you're pregnant, instead of drying up until your period comes ..    Could I have ovulated a second time in one month & got pregnant? Please don't be judgemental or anything. Thanks for your help, it's much appreciated.

20090202194728AAaolR9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	8 weeks pregnant? Two Months with Light Spotting! Your experiences, please!?	Today's date is Feb. 1.      I am 24 years old and have NEVER missed a period and my periods have always been 5-6 days, mild-heavy and I always get horrible cramps.      Well, my last normal period started on Dec. 4. I had unprotected sex 2 weeks later... 5 times within a 36 hour time-frame (he pulled out in what I thought was PLENTY of time... like minutes to spare).  Yes, I already know that pulling out is not an actual method.      Then, Two weeks after that (Jan. 3) my period started, but it wasn't much of a "period" because it only lasted 2-3 days and was very light and NO cramps!      On Jan. 31 I had light pink spotting when I wiped in the morning. That became brown spotting later in the evening, but extremely light... it's pretty much only there when I pee or wipe.      Today, Feb. 1, I have still had this very light brown spotting. I have only had to wear 2 thin panty liners each day and I don't really even need them! AND I have NO cramps, which is VERY strange for me. I do, however, feel a little bloated and gassy this evening. I haven't had much of an appetite.  For example, I only ate 2 pieces of toast and half of a milk shake today.  I just feel... full!      I took a pregnancy test ( HPT ) and it was negative, so what gives?      I told my sister about this. She was pregnant with her first, and only child, about 4 years ago. She was on birth control when she and her husband conceived, but she didn't realize she was pregnant until she was 3 months along, because she had continued to have what she thought was her period for 3 months AND she didn't have any symptoms (no "morning sickness," no sore breasts, etc.). Strange, huh?      I don't know if I should go to my OBGYN or not, because if the HPT are testing negative then I am sure that is what the doc's test will find too, right?      Also, I hardly ever have sex. LOL. And Dec. 17-19 was the last time I have had sex, (and I hadn't had sex for several months before that) so if I am pregnant that is when I would've conceived. If I am pregnant, I would be about 6-8 weeks, right??????????? I am going insane!      Please answer if you have gone through a similar experience or know of someone that has. I would love any advice. No sarcastic comments, please. Thanks so much to all of you that care.      I am not on birth control. I have been off of the NuvaRing for well over a year... probably stopped taking BC about 16 months ago and I have been completely regular, so this is quite a shock.      THANK YOU
20090202194746AAbPz0g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I need Nursing Bra HELP!!?	Before I was pregnant I had wore 'Body by Victoria Secret' bras for about 5 years. It has a slight pushup and made my chest look nicely rounded. I've tried so many different nursing bras - its just driving me nuts! I bought a sports bra type from Motherhood Maternity that is comfortable and I've been wearing it all the time. I also just bought a Bravado bra from Target and am returning it.    Just a couple questions....   1 - Is having an underwire on a nursing bra a bad thing?   2 - Anyone know of a bra that is a pushup nursing bra and makes you look attractive like the 'Body by Victoria Secret. I can't handle looking like I have a sagging chest, I'm only 22.      Please only polite answers..

20090202200851AAP4ofQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How Can I Show My Mom She Is Ruining My Life? 16 year old girl!?	She's always yelling or complaining. About the stupidest things! If a pot isn't in the right spot, get out of the house and town, or you'll get yelled at for the rest of the day. If somebody isn't 100% perfect, or messes up 1 little thing, she goes off. She walks away, like they did something wrong, and complains/yells to me about it. Like, she's a *****!, or I don't know, I can't think right now. My life when I'm at school, not with my mom, I'm smiling, I'm happy, I'm who I want to be. At home, I'm held back, I'm yelled at, and all this. She said right now "Maybe you should go to a residental school" or w/e like living away from home. She has also told me I should live in a mental hospital. I've heard it more than once. She calls me fat to my face. She says I have issues, to my face. My mom doesn't know how my life is.      How Can I Show Her, that She's Ruining My Life?      At school, I forget about home, I forget about her, and I act like my life is perfect, because there are people there that actually want me.
20090202195753AA4ihtJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I am going to an intake hearing for custody what do I have to bring?	Okay so tomorrow I am going to the first intake hearing for custody, my ex filled the papers and I know he has the right to see her but since I was pregnant I gave him and his parents the chance to visit her. My ex would always come and go and his parents was ALWAYS to busy to come over to see my child. Well anyways I am not going to get into the whole story I just want to know what is the necessary documents to bring? I have all the e-mails that I wrote to my ex and his parents and all the e-mails that they wrote to me. I wrote a log once I found out I was pregnant everytime he would come and go and how he never came any of the doctors apps. I was just wondering I am in my last year of school and I am going to college this fall I was wondering is it necessary to bring my report cards, my acceptance letter for college, and my birth classes papers that I got when I was pregnant for completing the birth class. The reason why I thought about bringing them is because these items doesn't just mean that its about me, its me giving my child a better future by graduation from school getting good grades, going to college to make more money. I was wondering would this be necessary to bring with me or would they just over look it? PLease help me out       Thanks so much if anyone can help me.

My sister seeks my help to look after her daughters (both below 6).  She just got her new job & has been assigned to another district (3hours from my house). She finds it's hard to manage/handle her kids at new place with her new job.      I'm a working mother to a 7months old baby boy.  My hubby is working outstation too.

20090202200646AAHcGDj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter won't poop on the potty?	She is fully potty trained night/day when it comes to pee. When she needs to poop she will go to the potty and want to sit but once she gets on she says she doesn't need to go. I feel that I have tried everything. Rewards to making her just sit there for 10 minutes. Nothing works. She is not afraid at all and really wants to go on the potty but for some reason the feeling goes away once she gets on the potty. Then 10 min after she tries the feeling comes back. I have been telling her to go in her pants lately because if she doesn't she will go up to 5 days before she goes. Any help would be great. BTW she is 28 months old.

Now im still sick as can be and eating just makes it worse. I've already had a kid and know the signs of pregnancy. What are the chances of me being pregnant now? I have read alot of stories of people getting pregnant on the depo shot, and im kind of worried. And occassionally i'll have some mucus plug looking stuff come out with blood in it but not the regular bleeding. I need help!!!

20090202151732AAdIlSM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible that I could be pregnant?	Ok here's what I am curious about. I have been having nausea, 1 day it was so bad I never got out of bed all day an dcoul not eat a thing for like 3 days...weird cravings, tired a lot, very vivid dreams, I smell everything strongly, esp. garlic BLAH! Feel sorta like car sicky feeling off and on all day for a week now.   I have to pee like every 20 min. I feel very off! Now I have been pregnant before and the smell thing and nausea was my biggest symptoms, ok well I have been having periods, so it can't be possible right?? My last 2 periods have been weird and off compared to my like clock work periods, but they have been heavy but only for like 1 full day, then like 3 days of just light bleeding or brown spotting. But no sore boobs only just a week before my periods. So I can't be pregnant right? Not possible right?

20090202152307AACQcVW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sciatic nerve pain during pregnancy?	I'm only in my 13th week and have been having the nerve pain since about my 7th week, due to how small I am. My question is does the pain worsen over time? How bad can it get? I've heard horror stories about having to be in a wheel chair by the end because of the pain. Is there any truth to this? Has anyone experienced this before? I'm still in school and would rather not have to be pushed around school in a wheel chair. Thank you! =)
