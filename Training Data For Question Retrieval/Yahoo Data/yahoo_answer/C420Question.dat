Je viens d'acquérir la boule de lavage génial qui contient des petites boules en céramique et qui remplace la lessive et que vous avez peut-être vu à la télévision.   J'ai longtemps hésité à l'acheter mais ?a y est c'est fait.   C'est vraiment magique!!!!   Le linge ressort propre et frais.   C'est écologique, économique, naturel.   L'avantage en plus c'est que l'on peut mélanger tout type de textile et toutes les couleurs confondues. Donc en plus économie d'eau car on fait moins de lavages.   Un vrai bonheur.   Pourquoi n'a t-elle pas été inventée plus t?t ?   Je me suis débarassée de ma javel et de ma lessive habituel.   La boule dure environ 3 ans à raison de 2 lavages par jour.   J'en suis ravie.

Je leur dépose donc  des graines de tournesol dans une petite mangeoire en forme de maison.   Problème : de gros pigeons et tourterelles l'ont repéré et viennent  en famille pour tout dévorer en peu de temps. Ils empêchent même l'accès aux petits en leur donnant des coups de bec.   Merci de me dire comment vous faites pour parvenir  à gérer équitablement cette situation.

20080707193341AAmooOp	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Watering the lawn and new plants?	We haven't had rain for at least 3 weeks. We had new shrubs, a few perennials and a tree installed last week. I've been hand watering with a hose 2-3 times a week but haven't had time to get to the lawn until today. Since we're in a city that regulates when we can water (odd house numbers on odd days, even house number on even days), I can't leave water running unattended on even days, since we are in an odd numbered house.       I didn't get home until 8:30, and am trying to get as much of the lawn and new plantings as I can before I go to bed. I'm doing different areas about 30 minutes at a time. It's 9:30, and I'm thinking I'll only be able to do this for another hour.       Is 30 minutes at a time going to do anything at all for a lawn that hasn't seen a decent rain in almost a month, or am I wasting my time and water? Should I just shut off the water and not worry about it?      I'm going to hand water the new plantings with the hose tomorrow (my day off, but an even numbered day!!!)

20090227022251AAHmjbM	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Advice Please On Dying Fabrics?	I love dying fabric and fabric swatches for sewing projects but I am getting irritated with black and dark brown dyes giving me varying shades of purple even on pristine white 100% cotton. I can't have every project I churn out in the same colour.   I've pretty much given up on dying anything black.   I'm not picky about exact shades or evenness throughout as that only adds to the funky appearance I'm striving for.   I have used both Rit and hot and cold Dylon.   Mostly I use chopped up pre-owned pieces and will buy the items I want in the colour I want when available - which is tricky to do.   Any advice for getting brown dye to actually dye brown?   I'm open to combining colours if you have a formula you like...I've tried doing some of that with mixed results.   Many thanks.

20090305065142AARpbfQ	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	American Signature Furniture/Value City Furniture - Looking for similar set?	I saw this on both of their websites.       http://www.asfurniture.com/webapp/wcs/st...       I love it!  However I've read reviews and people generally don't seem pleased with their products or service.      I even sent them an email telling them I couldn't find a store near me (their store locator is a pretty shabby tool because you can only search by city or zip code).   Meaning if I can't find a store near my city, I just have to guess different cities and states until a store is found.  It's awful.  Whatever happened to a simple list?!  Their response to my email was something straight off the website (which didn't even answer my question) saying, "We currently do not offer online shopping, but you can print out your shopping list and take it to a store near you!"      In any case, I couldn't find a store near me, and you can't shop online, so I'm stuck there.  But I really love that set!  Do you know of any other places that have a similar set?

20090305065140AAVVTaL	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Should the plasterer finish the work completely or is this the decorators job?	We have a Project Manager in to oversee work on our house. The new plaster around the ceiling spots has broken in parts leaving a 2cm diameter hole around each spot. The new narrower pipe casing also has a 2cm gap running alongside it with no plaster as the PM got the plastering done first. Bit messy and needs sorting out before we can paint. Our PM is now saying we need a decorator to fix the holes and gaps which will cost extra as this is not the plasterer's job - is he right?? No discussion of possibility of holes, poor finish etc before the work started. Thanks!
